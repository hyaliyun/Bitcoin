It was worked between about 1825 and 1923. It played a significant part in the Penrhyn Great Strike, Britain's longest industrial dispute.  History  = Early history = The early history of the quarry is obscure, but it appears to have started around 1825, and was certainly working in 1845, when quarryman John Hughes of Maentwrog fell to his death into the pit, which was then deep. In 1860, owned by William Owen, the Pantdreiniog Slate Company produced 3,000 tons of slate, dropping to 1,372 tons produced by 30 men in 1864. During the 1860s, the quarry expanded and took over the adjacent Coetmor Quarry. Sometime in the late 1860s the quarry closed. In 1872, the quarry was re-opened by the Bangor and Pant-Dreiniog Slate Co. (Ltd.) and took on 50 workers. That year they produced 1,500 tons of finished slate. In 1884, it was recorded as worked by the Pant Dreiniog Slate Company and producing blue, purple and red slates, but that was the only year the quarry worked between 1881 and 1886, leaving the quarrymen out of work and reliant on charity. = W. J. Parry takes over = In 1896, a major industrial dispute at the nearby Penrhyn quarry resulted in hundreds of quarrymen being locked out and left without work. Alderman William John Parry was determined to help. Parry had been one of the founders of the North Wales Quarrymen's Union in 1874, and was the union's first general secretary. He led a syndicate from South Wales that purchased Pantdreiniog and was appointed manager of the quarry. By October he had taken on 40 workers, announcing his intention to only employ married men in an effort to support the families of the strikers as well as the men. This venture failed, and in March 1900 Parry was forced to put the quarry up for sale. There was no successful bid at the auction, and the quarry company went into liquidation, throwing 106 men out of work. = The Penrhyn Great Strike = On 22 November 1900, the continued friction between the quarrymen an owners at Penrhyn quarry resulted in another strike and lock out. This was the start of the \\"Great Strike of Penrhyn\\", which lasted for three years and was the longest dispute in British industrial history. 2,000 skilled workers were locked out and left without income. Parry saw an opportunity to provide work for the strikers at Pantdreiniog. In March 1901, he restarted the quarry as a worker's co- operative. In the first month of operation, the quarry turned a small profit and was able to pay wages of 32s 6p (equivalent to £ in 2018) a week. Slate produced here was shipped via the LNWR to Deganwy on the River Conwy. This initial attempt failed sometime in 1902, but in the summer 1903, with the Penrhyn strike still underway, Parry tried again. A new enterprise North Wales Quarries Ltd. was started, funded mainly by the North Wales Quarrymen's Union. The union contributed over £15,000 (£) to purchase Pantdreiniog, along with the nearby Moel Faban and Tanybwlch quarries. The quarries were together called the Bethesda Co-operative Quarries and Parry was appointed the Managing Director. The company was formally incorporated on 3 October 1903. Richard Bell, the MP for Derby was the chairman of the company. In November 1903, the Penrhyn strike ended and many quarrymen started to return to work there. Despite the good intentions, a rift developed between Parry and the union. Parry's terms of employment were seen as almost as draconian as those that cause the Great Strike at Penrhyn. The President of the union, Henry Jones, was among the quarrymen who refused to work at the co-operative under Parry. In his 1905 address to the union he said: > One of the greatest dangers of labour organisations was to fall into the > hands of men ... who professed sympathy with the common people merely in > order to attain personal ends. He would say nothing of the agreement which > he and others refused to sign, and for which they had been discharged, > because, as Mr W. J. Parry admitted, \\"they had not accepted the terms of the > company. If the agreement was fair, then the whole history of the Union was > of no avail. Parry had locked out his quarrymen over the disagreement about their contracts and was generally held to be against the workers and the union. By May 1906, Pantdreiniog was back at work, but slate prices were falling, and in 1909 the company laid off 55 of its men. The quarry closed in October 1910. = Revival after 1919 = After the First World War, there was a brief boom in the slate industry as a large number of new houses were built in Britain under the Addison Act. In 1919, a new company the Pant Dreiniog Slate Quarry Company Ltd. was formed. It intended to rework material from the quarry's waste tips and pulverise it. The resulting slate dust would be formed into bricks and slabs. Initially only the grinding operation took place at the quarry, with the dust shipped to factories in Birmingham and Leigh where it was pressed into bricks. Because this process did not require the firing used to make traditional clay bricks, it was claimed to be a faster and cheaper alternative. As well as bricks, the company experimented with creating rubber goods, Portland cement, paint and pottery. Yet again, William Parry was involved in the new company, called the North Wales Development Company. The company purchased a Bradley pulverizing machine for grinding the waste and also attempted to build prefabricated houses using slate slabs in steel frame for the walls. Parry died in 1927, and it appears that this final effort to work Pant Dreiniog for slate failed at or just before this date. = Development after closure = Pantdreiniog's was surrounded on three sides by the houses of Bethesda. Finding enough space to tip the large amounts of waste slate was a problem for all slate quarries, but was particularly acute for Pantdreiniog. In the 1880s, they purchased a row of houses on Cilfodan Street and tipped over them. The high tips were held back by pack walls. After the quarry closed, the tips remained. They were considered both dangerous and a significant urban blight. Between 1957 and 1976 the Pantdreiniog pit was used as a landfill site. In the 1980s, the waste tips were removed and the quarry site was turned into open land.  Transport  Like most of the local slate quarries, Pantdreiniog had an extensive internal tramway system, of approximately gauge. Before 1900, a long incline ran up the east side of the pit, powered by a steam engine. Parry's enterprise of 1896 saw the quarry re- equipped and the incline was replaced by a lift on the north edge of the pit. Tramways ran east to the mill, then south to the waste tips above the town. The North Wales Quarries Ltd. further expanded the tramway network after they took over in 1903. They also purchased a steam locomotive from W.G. Bagnall to work the every lengthening tip line above Tan-y-Ffordd. Two steam locomotives worked at the quarry, supplied by W.G. Bagnall. They were works number 1726 delivered in October 1903 and named Richard Bell, and works number 1863, delivered in November 1907, named J C Grey. Both were locomotives of the Mercedes class.

She used the pen name of E. Owens Blackburne. Early life and education Born Elizabeth Owens Blackburne Casey on 10 May 1848 in Slane, County Meath, she was the daughter of Andrew Casey and Miss Mills. She went blind when she was 11 but had her sight restored by Sir William Wilde. Casey was educated in Trinity College Dublin. She went on to become a writer. She contributed to the Irish Nationalist paper, The Nation. She moved to London when she was about 25 to work as a journalist. It was there she published several novels which were quite popular. However one of her novels Erin: A Story of Today was published at about the same time as the Phoenix Park Murders which damaged her reputation and resulted in a loss of sales for her. As a result she required support from the Royal Literary Fund to survive. She lived poorly and died in a fire in Drumcondra, Dublin in 1894. Timing The timing of a story calling for greater understanding between Ireland and England in a time when the political situation between the two countries was tense and two senior officials had just been murdered by radical rebels meant that Casey was treated very badly by the press. In the London Athenaeum review on 20 May 1882 the press called Blackburne \\"a thoroughgoing partisan of the Land League\\". As a result her books would no longer be published.

It was the first time that Ghana had submitted a film for the Best International Feature Film Oscar. Plot A young girl, Amina, lives with her mother, grandmother and uncle in a small village outside of Accra. She lives a comfortable but boring life to which her mother wishes to free her. Her grandmother wishes for Amina to marry an older man from their village. Amina's mother protests and unknowingly sells Amina to strangers in the hopes of her finding a better life in the city. On her journey Amina meets young man who was also sold as a young man and, in some way, becomes her only friend. The two run away with a small band of kids who were also sold off. As the two embark on various errands through Accra they try to earn their keep. The young man, Seidu, becomes popular as he is a quick and hard worker. Amina is clumsy and cannot keep up with the work given to her. She quickly finds herself living in a compound of a woman who demands rent daily. Here Amina learns in order to stay she must always have money, however her job as a head-porter is not lucrative enough. She decides to join her neighbor, the landlord's favorite, as a prostitute in order to stay. For a while this goes well, but she grows sadder as the work goes on. Eventually she tries to reunite with Seidu. He turns her away because he cannot afford to be an outsider in his newly found living/working arrangements as a porter. Amina returns to the taxing compound and grows complacent as time passes. During this time Amina's Uncle, Akatok, goes to search for Amina in Accra after her mother finds out the news her daughter is “missing”. For months Akatok searches but to no avail. He decides he will give up after just three months of searching, but is put back on track by an old friend with great advice. Amina, now more accustomed to her job, sleeps with a man who refuses to pay her the promised wage. She, in turn, breaks a glass over his head and steals the money from his wallet. Amina runs to find Seidu to tell him she wishes to go back home. Instead she find Seidu's boss who calls her in to wait on Seidu together. Seidu's boss attacks Amina while they are alone and rapes her. Seidu comes back to the terrible scene and apologizes for interrupting his boss. As he backs away he is visibly distraught by what he's just witnessed. Seidu, later on, beats his boss for what he's done leaving him bleeding in the street. Amina returns to the demanding landlord and her neighbor who tries to care for her after the attack. Soon after Amina and the landlord learn of Amina's pregnancy to which the landlord berates her. Amina cannot have a baby in the compound, so she goes to live on the streets of Accra while just a few weeks pregnant. Eight months pass and Amina has become a head-porter again, this time more graceful and heavier; she is in her last trimester of pregnancy. Akatok and his friend continue their search nearby. While working Amina encounters a mob of people who are trying to beat a man to death. They call this man an animal and pour gasoline over him. Once she comes closer Amina realizes that the bloodied and beaten man is Seidu. In disgust and horror she turns away as the match is being lit. She also notices Seidu's boss in the crowd watching over everything as dark smoke begins to rise behind him. At this moment Akatok and his long-time friend spot Amina in the crowd and go to her. Akatok is overjoyed but it is short-lived as he notices Seidu's boss. He points out the man to Amina as her father, Razak; Amina immediately faints on hearing the news. Finally, back in her hometown Amina, and Akatok, find her mother and grandmother in their compound. They rejoice for her return but again Amina falters, clutching her stomach. She gives birth in her family's compound under the star-filled sky. In the final scenes we hear the baby crying and the grandmother chanting over the baby. We hear a man, presumably Akatok, speak in his native tongue. The words on screen as he speaks read: This child will never be accepted by tradition so in our hearts we buried a secret only heaven knows. Cast * Ama K.

The book was released on November 30, 2018, through DeLonge's own To the Stars publishing company. Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes? is DeLonge's second children's book, following 2013's The Lonely Astronaut On Christmas Eve illustrated by Mike Henry.  Background  Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes? was written before DeLonge's first children's book The Lonely Astronaut On Christmas Eve from 2013, but he lost his draft of the book. He was able to revive the project after a family member found a draft in an old journal of his. DeLonge enjoys writing children's books because the elements of poetry and rhyming schemes are similar to songwriting.  Synopsis  While taking a bath, a man's clothes are stolen by an unknown and unseen thief. The man then wanders naked around his home, neighborhood and town on a quest to answer the question, \\"who here knows who took my clothes?\\". The quest ends in a cave where he finds his clothes and the giggling monster who took them.  Other media  First editions of Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes? ordered directly through To the Stars included a limited-edition 7\\" flexi disc audiobook narrated by Tom DeLonge. After the first edition quickly sold out, To the Stars released an animated version of Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes? on YouTube in 2019, which features the artwork of Ryan Jones animated by film editor Zach Passero and was also narrated by DeLonge. DeLonge met Jones through artist Gustavo Mendonca, who has worked on other To the Stars projects, and said of the collaboration: \\"Ryan's fun and rich artwork married perfectly with my sense of humor. Then Zach Passero and his incredible animation skills entered the picture and we wound up making something that I think is really special.\\"  References   External links  * Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes? on YouTube Category:2018 children's books ","title":"Who Here Knows Who Took My Clothes?"},{"id":"61837125","text":"Tolstaya Dubrova () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Dubrovsky Selsoviet, Aleysky District, Altai Krai, Russia.

She was convener of the college's School of Fine Arts, and dean of the Mills College faculty. She also taught Latin and Greek and was head of the classics department at Earlham College in Indiana, from 1921 to 1928. Her dissertation project, a translation and commentary titled Maphaeus Vegius and his Thirteenth Book of the Aeneid, was published by Stanford University Press in 1930, and reissued in 2002. Brinton prepared A Pre-Raphaelite Aeneid, which was privately published in 1934 by art collector Estelle Doheny (wife of Edward L. Doheny). She was a delegate to the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference in Hawaii in 1930. In 1931 and 1932, she held a Woodbrooke Fellowship, for advanced studies at Selly Oak College in England. She was a speaker at the Institute of World Affairs meeting in Riverside, California, in 1934. = American Friends Service Committee = Brinton was active with the AFSC for decades, serving on the organization's board from 1938 to 1965. After World War I, she went to Silesia with the organization's child feeding program. In 1931, she and her husband organized the Pacific Yearly Meeting, a west coast organization of Friends. In 1936, the Brintons were named co-directors of the Pendle Hill Quaker Center for Study and Contemplation, near Philadelphia. She was the AFSC's Commissioner for Asia from 1948. In 1952, the Brintons went to Japan with the AFSC, to direct Quaker postwar relief work in Tokyo. In the 1960s, she was president of the Friends Historical Association.

Following the exposure of the Burke and Hare murders in Edinburgh in 1828, anatomists came under scrutiny, and the anatomy rooms were nicknamed \\"Burkin' Houses\\" by the public, relating to the newly created verb \\"to burke\\". The actions initially resulted in the Offences Against the Person Act 1828.Offences Against the Person Act 1828 However, stories relating to Moir, such as his finding \\"a body\\" on the surface, whilst bodysnatching in a graveyard, and the body \\"recovering\\" because they were only drunk, hold no water at all. It must be remembered Moir was a qualified surgeon and would know a dead body from a live body. What appears to have happened is a mythology has built up, based on very little, and worsened by Moir's early death, offering him no chance of self-defence. This is sad, as the actual evidence indicates a highly capable anatomist.Aberdeen Evening Press 19 January 2017 In December 1831 a crowd burned down the anatomy rooms (the Burkin Hoose). Although three of the rioters were imprisoned, Moir escaped punishment and continued to work. This indicates that much of the stories were fanciful. The estimates of the crowd at 20,000 are equally ludicrous,Scotsman newspaper 13 November 2017 as it would not be possible to place this number in the adjacent streets around the anatomy room. This figure would also represent 100% of the adult Aberdeen population at that time.1831 census Aberdeen - population given as 58,000 men, women and children A more realistic figure is probably 200 persons. The Anatomy Act 1832 regulrised the whole situation, allowing parish councils to give the bodies of paupers for dissection, immediately stemming the demand for body-snatching.Anatomy Act 1832 It is not \\"impossible\\" that Moir partook in body-snatching between the critical dates of 1828 and 1832. It is, however, unlikely. The stories appear more a product of public outrage. What is more likely (as it was accepted throughout the anatomy profession) was that the bodies received were not all legitimate bodies as these only included executed criminals, and the demand far outstripped the supply. It appears that all anatomists prior to 1832 were happy to \\"turn a blind eye\\" to where bodies were obtained. In terms of the authorities and prosecution, even the highly culpable Robert Knox avoided prosecution. Indeed, no anatomist had any charges raised against them, despite their knowing collusion. In 1843 his lecture rooms are listed as Kingsland Place and Flourmill Lane, and he lived at 63 Guestrow.Aberdeen Post Office Directory 1843 He died of typhoid in February 1844,Grave of Andrew Moir, Kirk of St Nicholas aged only 38, and is buried in the church of the Kirk of St Nicholas. His grave is an old-fashioned table stone on the east side of the path near the north entrance to the churchyard. Family Not known.

It is one of two most important official registries in the US for the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT); the other is the United Kennel Club (UKC). ADBA was co-founded as an all-breed registry in 1909 by Guy McCord and Con Feeley as to promote John Colby's strain of pit bulls and establish an American Pit Bull Terrier registry. ADBA is located in Salt Lake City, Utah, and sponsors conformation dog shows, weight pulling competitions, and Top Dog Athletic Events consisting of three canine competitions: treadmill race, wall climb and lure coursing. The modern registry focuses primarily on the American Pit Bull Terrier with a few exceptions. It is the accepted breed standard for American Pit Bull Terriers in the United Kingdom. ADBA issues pedigree and DNA certifications and promotes events such as conformation shows and sport events like Weight pulling and Top Dog. The ADBA is considered the largest and most important American Pit Bull Terrier breed registry. History The ADBA was founded in 1909 by Guy McCord and Con Feeley as, both of whom were breeders of American Pit Bull Terriers. They were also friends with John Pritchard Colby of Newberry, MA. who was a breeder of fighting pit bulls which became known as the Colby strain. In the early 1900s, Colby advertised as having \\"bred and sold more fighting dogs than any one man in America.\\" In the beginning, ADBA considered the Colby strain as \\"the mainstay of the ADBA which prompted the boast of being the 'home' registration office of the Colby dogs.\\" With the recognition of the American Pit Bull Terrier as a standard breed, the ADBA distanced itself from any association to dog fighting. Breeders with APBTs that were registered with the ADBA became persistent in their efforts to dispel the public's impression that the breed was used only for fighting purposes. In 1951, the ADBA was managed by Frank Ferris and his wife Florence Colby, widow of John Colby. Activities of the ADBA were limited, but with an exclusive focus on the registration of American Pit Bull Terriers. In 1973, Ferris had his sights on retirement and sold the ADBA to Ralph Greenwood. A few years later, owners of registered dogs petitioned the ADBA to develop a breed standard for conformation dog shows, but they wanted one that was unique to the ADBA rather than copying the breed standards of the American Kennel Club (AKC) or UKC. In 1976, the ADBA formulated the APBT Heritage Conformation Standard on which ADBA sponsored conformation shows are judged; the goal being to maintain the \\"traits of intelligence, character, loyalty, and the athletic conformation that the breed was originally bred for hundreds of years ago.\\" ADBA registration Beginning in early 2015, ADBA investigated and identified issues in the APBT Stud Book which resulted in the following corrections: *An ideal range of breed weight was added to the breed standard. *The American Staffordshire Terrier was confirmed as a separate breed; therefore, the American Staffordshire Terriers (Am Staffs) that were registered with AKC were double registered to include ADBA registration. *Single registrations for crossbreeds between the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier were no longer accepted. *Prior to ADBA's 2013 acknowledgement of issues in their APBT Stud Book, they had accepted numerous UKC APBT registrations, and recognized the American Bully as a separate breed. On July 15, 2013, UKC accepted the American Bully breed and established the foundation process. Dogs that were previously registered in the APBT Studbook were removed from that registry. Dogs that fit the American Bully breed type were registered as an American Bully. Exceptions included any dog with any condition or exaggeration that has been determined to be detrimental to the health, soundness and general welfare of the American Bully or any other breed. The ADBA's breed standard for the American Pit Bull Terrier is the standard used in the UK for determining if a dog is of the prohibited \\"pit bull terrier type\\" under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. In response, the ADBA's breed standard for the APBT includes a disclaimer forbidding its use in determining if a dog meets the definition of a prohibited or restricted dog for breed-specific legislation. In 2009 the ADBA, along with the Endangered Dog Breeders Association, filed an amicus brief in the case of United States v. Stevens alleging 18 U.S.C. § 48 was too broad and violated the First Amendment.  Breeds  The ADBA is a club focused on preserving the American Pit Bull Terrier breed, and its conformation and sports events are mostly for this breed. Despite this, the club accepts to register all breeds recognized by the UKC and AKC, in addition to registering the new breed Working Pit Bulldog.

Gradually these farmers took over more and more Kam land, forcing the Kam to flee into mountain valleys. The displaced Kam led difficult lives and a drought in Wu Mian's village pushed thousands to the point of starvation. However the Ming emperor Zhu Yuanzhang continued to collect taxes from them. They rebelled against the Ming dynasty in 1378. Rebellion In 1378, a Kam army surrounded the prefectural city of Liping. The Ming forces were too weak to fight, so they invited the Kam leaders into the city for negotiations. Wu Mian's father was one of the leaders. Once they were inside, they were arrested. Wu Mian's father died soon afterwards. Wu Mian vowed to take revenge. He attempted to shoot the emperor with bow and arrow, but missed three times. The emperor immediately dispatched 100,000 troops to capture Wu Mian. Wu Mian led an insurrection which lasted seven years before he was captured in 1385. Aftermath According to Kam folklore, Wu Mian amassed a great amount of treasure during his time as a fugitive and hid it away under a hill which could only be accessed by a man sized hole.

The building, which was the headquarters of Durham County Council from 1898 to 1963, is a Grade II listed building. History In the 18th century the justices held the assizes in the Shire Hall (also known as the County House) beside Palace Green; they then moved to a new courthouse at the head of Old Elvet in 1811. Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, it became necessary to find a meeting place for Durham County Council. County leaders decided that the courthouse was not suitable for the purpose and chose to procure county council offices nearby: the site they selected in Old Elvet had previously been occupied by a row of large residential properties. The foundation stone for the new building was laid by the Lord Lieutenant of Durham, the Earl of Durham in April 1896. It was designed by Harry Barnes and Frederick Coates in the Baroque style, built by David and John Rankin at a cost of £14,000 and was officially opened by Alderman Samuel Storey on 26 July 1898. The design involved a symmetrical main frontage with nine bays in red terracotta facing onto Old Elvet with the end bays slightly projected forwards; the central section, which also slightly projected forwards, featured an arched doorway on the ground floor with a wrought-iron grill; there was a pair of round headed windows on the first floor and a tower with a copper-clad dome at roof level. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber. A new wing banded in stone and brick which added an extra three bays to the east of the main building was completed in 1905. A memorial to county council staff who had died in the First and Second World Wars was unveiled by the Chairman of the County Council, Councillor Thomas Benfold, on 10 November 1948. Nikolaus Pevsner did not take a favourable view of the building in his 1953 Buildings of England volume, where he described the building as a \\"deplorable\\" building \\"with monumental intentions and disastrous effects\\" whose \\"cursedly imperishable red Victorian brick... is such crushing proof of technical proficiency and aesthetic dumbness\\". After the County Council moved to County Hall at Aykley Heads in October 1963, the Shire Hall served as the administrative headquarters of Durham University until September 2012 when the University moved to the Mountjoy site, in the Palatine Centre on Stockton Road. The Shire Hall then stood vacant until it was converted for use as a hotel by Brims of Sunderland to the plans of HL Architects: it re-opened as the Hotel Indigo in March 2018.

Educated at the in Iaşi, she graduated in 1883 and began teaching there that same year. Continuing her studies at the same time, she enrolled at the University of Iaşi, studying both in the normal school and philosophical faculties. In 1885, she transferred to the Oltea Doamna Lyceum and graduated in 1888. In 1893, she went to Paris to study at the University of Paris and the Collège de France, earning her doctorate in 1895. Returning to Romania, she became the director of the Normal School of Applications and taught both pedagogy and psychology at the for more than two decades. In addition to her teaching Conta-Kernbach published literary works beginning 1891 and in her later life as an active suffragist published articles in favor of women's rights and equality. She was one of the founders in 1918, of the Association for the Civil and Political Emancipation of Romanian Women in Iași. The first woman admitted to the General Council of Instruction, she also served from 1913 as the inspector for all girls' schools throughout the country until her death in 1921. Conta- Kernbach was honored twice by the government of Romania with the Educational Work Reward Medal, first class, for both primary and secondary education. She is regarded as one of the pioneering teachers who helped develop the educational system and pedagogic theory in Romania. Early life Ana Conta was born on 5 November 1865 in Târgu Neamț in the Kingdom of Romania to Mărioarei (née Scutariu) and Grigore Conta. She was the next to last sibling in the family of ten children, which included her older brother Vasile Conta, who would become a philosopher and politician. Her family was originally from the commune of Bodeştii-Precistei, where several generations had served in the priesthood of the Romanian Orthodox Church. Her father was hired in 1864 to serve at the Bărboi Monastery in Iaşi, where the family moved soon after her birth. Her mother died when Conta was young, and her brother Vasile became an important influence on her sense of responsibility to address societal issues. He also encouraged her musical ability and she became an accomplished pianist. In 1878, Conta entered the . She completed the seven-year curricula within five years and graduated in 1883. Continuing her education, that year, she entered the University of Iaşi studying both in the normal school and philosophical faculties. Simultaneously with her university studies, she taught history, logic, and psychology at the Humpel Institute, until 1885, when she began teaching at the Liceul \\"Oltea Doamna\\" (Oltea Doamna Lyceum), where she remained for almost a decade. Conta obtained her degree, magna cum laude in 1888 and in 1891, married poet Gheorghe Kernbach, who encouraged her to begin writing and publishing both poems and prose. Her debut as a writer occurred in Convorbiri literare (Literary Conversations) in 1891 and other works were soon published in the journals ' (Literary Jubilee) and Arhiva (Archive). In 1893, Conta-Kernbach went to Paris, without her husband to continue her education. Taking courses in art history, pedagogy, and philosophy, she studied at the University of Paris and the Collège de France. Career That year, at the request of the Ministry of Education, Conta- Kernbach produced two reports evaluating vocational education available to girls in France. The following year, she provided an assessment on the same topic for girls from Saint Petersburg. In 1895, she completed her doctorate, again graduating magna cum laude, and returned to Iași, where she began teaching pedagogy and psychology at the and would remain there for more than 20 years. She also was named by the Ministry of Education as the director of the Şcolii Normale de Aplicaţie (Normal School of Applications) and worked to modernize the professionalism of teachers with pedagogic training at both schools. Her approach to pedagogy was to use both association and experimental psychology put forth by masters like John Amos Comenius, Friedrich Fröbel, John Locke, and others and apply their ideas to education from a Romanian context. Conta-Kernbach was one of the first Romanian delegates sent by the government to international scientific meetings. She participated in the International Congress of Women's Institutions, held in Paris in 1899, the International Congress of Pedagogy, hosted in Brussels in 1911, as well as other events hosted in Geneva and Nuremberg. They also sent her abroad to research the organization of schools in France and Germany and she became the first woman admitted to the General Council of Instruction. The Council of Instruction is the body which determines requirements for schooling and from 1913 until her death, she served as the inspector for all girls' schools throughout the country. She was awarded the medal Răsplata Muncii pentru Învățământ (Educational Work Reward Medal) first class, for primary education and later the same award for secondary education. During World War I, Conta- Kernbach became involved in the feminist movement and began publishing articles about wage equity and protecting women's rights to be professionals. She proposed that women be allowed to become citizens in their own right, and supported women's suffrage, co-founding the Asociția pentru emanciparea civilă și politică a femeilor române (Association for the Civil and Political Emancipation of Romanian Women) in Iași in 1918, along with Calypso Botez, Maria Baiulescu, Elena Meissner, Ella Negruzzi, Izabela Sadoveanu, Ortansa Satmary and . The goals of the Association were to work for legal, socio- economic, and political rights of women. That year, universal suffrage for men over the age of 21 was passed by the legislature and women were promised that at a future date their right to vote would be considered. In 1920, Conta- Kernbach petitioned the legislature to grant political rights for women who had demonstrated their public service, participated in the war, or who were wives and mothers of soldiers who fought in the conflict. Death and legacy Conta-Kernbach died from heart disease on 13 December 1921 in Iași and was buried in the city's Eternity Cemetery. In 1925, when Adela Xenopol established Revista scriitoarei (Woman Writer's Magazine), Conta-Kernbach was one of the featured feminists, whose writings were profiled in the influential journal. She is remembered as one of the pioneers who helped systematize Romanian pedagogy practices and education. Selected works =Journalism= * Munca şi plata ei.

The rebellion lasted only one year before their leader, Lin Kuan, was killed in October 1397. Background After the Wu Mian rebellion was defeated in 1385, 32,000 Ming soldiers came to settle in their land. This sparked a rebellion in 1397. Rebellion Lin Kuan's rebel army was initially successful, but the Ming continued to reinforce their army and soon the rebels were left with no option but to hide and attack from the densely forested hills. Villages which did not cooperate with the Ming soldiers were massacred. Lin Kuan and his men eventually found themselves surrounded by Ming troops on a mountain-top. According to Kam folklore, Lin Kuan planted an upside down fir sapling, saying that if it lived, then they too shall live. The sapling sprouted after two days, giving the rebels the courage to attack a weak point in the enemy ranks, breaking out. Despite the momentary success, Lin Kuan was captured and executed in October 1397. Aftermath During the short duration of the rebellion, 21,500 Kam and Miao people were killed.

Moore (6 March 1918, Canton, Ohio – 29 May 1969) was an American aeronautical engineer, known as a jet pack inventor. Wendell F. Moore studied aeronautical engineering at Kent State College and Indiana Technical College but seems to have worked as an engineer instead of completing an academic degree. After working for several manufacturers of automotive engines and aircraft accessories, he became in 1945 an engineer at Bell Aerosystems in Wheatfield, New York (part of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area). In December 1957 Bell Aerospace's team led by Moore began rig testing a jet pack on a tether. In 1959 the U.S. Army's Transportation Research and Engineering Command (TRECOM) issued a Request for Proposal asking for a feasibility study for a \\"small rocket lift device\\" for possible use by individual soldiers. In February 1960 Aerojet General submitted its feasibility study (for which it received $56,456). TRECOM then announced a request for proposals to actually build such a device. Bell Aerospace won against Aerojet General and Thiokol. Bell was promised $25,000 of government funding to build an operational prototype and embarked on 10 August 1960 on its program for an operational small rocket lift device.Great American Jet Pack, p. 29 Moore's team made eighty-eight successful test firings without destroying the test dummy or the test cell with supporting tethers inside a hangar. Moore tested the rocket belt with himself as the pilot on 29 December 1960. He was attached to supporting tethers. There were at least nine other people present, including a medical doctor.Great American Jet Pack, p. 39 On 17 February 1961, after nineteen tethered flights, Moore suffered his major setback when a tether could not support his weight after the rocket motor stopped firing. He fell onto the hangar's concrete floor from a height of about 2.5 meters (eight feet) and shattered one of his kneecaps.Great American Jet Pack, p. 40 After Moore's mishap, Bell replaced him as rocket belt pilot with Harold \\"Hal\\" Graham. After Graham had successfully completed thirty-six tethered flights, Moore and his team took the rocket belt to Niagara Falls International Airport, where on the 20th of April 1961, Graham made his historic flight. He became the first person to complete a successful flight with an untethered rocket belt. The entire flight lasted thirteen seconds and covered 112 feet (34 meters). During the flight Graham's feet were never more than eighteen inches (46 centimeters) off the ground.Great American Jet Pack, p. 44 Three major problems with the jet pack were that it ran out of fuel after 21 seconds, was difficult to pilot, and caused a noise level of about 125 decibels.Great American Jet Pack, p. 45 In July 1961 Moore submitted his official report to the U.S. Army, which accepted the results and declared the contract terminated. In June 1961 before the contract was terminated, Graham made a demonstration flight in which he flew over an army truck at Fort Eustis. A week later, Graham demonstrated the rocket belt in front of three thousand spectators at the Pentagon. He flew over an army staff car parked on the Pentagon lawn. Shortly afterward, Graham appeared on the television show To Tell the Truth.Great American Jet Pack, p. 47 On 5 July 1961, Wendell Moore appeared as a contestant on the television show I've Got a Secret. In 1965 he received the John Price Wetherill Medal for the invention of the \\"small lift rocket device\\". (Five others also received the Medal in 1965.) Moore had a wife and children.

Based at the time in Aarhus, she is remembered as a railway saboteur, explosives expert and courier in the resistance movement. Early life Born on 29 September 1921 in Korsør, Hedda Lundh was the daughter of the newspaper editor Theodor Lundh-Jensen (1884–1952) and Alpha Tusnelda Emilie Winckler (1887–1973). The youngest of three sisters, she was brought up in a middle-class home where her father called her his \\"boy\\" as she climbed trees, joined the scouts and cut her hair short. She completed her secondary school education at Aurehøj Gymnasium, matriculating in 1940, a few months after the German troops arrived. She then began to study literature at the University of Copenhagen. On 28 December 1940, she married Carl-Einar Maaløe. When her husband began to work in Aarhus in 1942, she continued her studies at Aarhus University. Resistance work It was in Aarhus that she joined an independent group of students under Morten Ruge who carried out sabotage work on the railways. They later joined the official Aarhus resistance movement under the leadership of Willy Samsing. Lundh became so proficient in handling explosives that she was sent to train other resistance members. There were also other women in Lundh's group, all helping to distribute weapons and explosives parachuted in by the British, sending them to resistance groups throughout Denmark. Lundh also acted as a telephone contact, forming part of a network of resistance workers whose addresses were kept secret from each other. In June 1944, the two groups Lundh had been involved in were discovered by the Gestapo. Most of the male members were sent to concentration camps in Germany while the women were imprisoned near Padborg. By a stroke of luck, Lundh and her husband avoided arrest and fled to Sweden where they spent the remainder of the war. Maaløe became a member of the Danish Brigade but, as a woman, Lundh was not allowed to join. Post-war career After the war, Lundh continued her studies, graduating with an MA in literature in 1952. From 1949 to 1960, based mainly in Paris, she covered cultural events for Social-Demokraten, worked for the press service at the Danish embassy, and taught in French high schools. In 1962, she returned to Aurehøj Gymnasium as a teacher. She was recognized as an inspiring teacher who made literature lessons surprisingly exciting. Hedda Lundh died on 2 March 2012 and is buried in Gentofte Cemetery.

She is mostly known from one or possibly two statues of her of very high quality. Chronology and family Amanimalel lived in the second half of the 7th century BC. Several date have been proposed for her queenship based on those estimated for Senkamanisken's rule: 643–623 BC, or 642–623 BC. Amanimalel is presumed to have been a queen consort of Senkamanisken, who was also married to queen Nasalsa and, possibly, Masalaye. As such, Amanimalel could be the mother of queens Asata and Madekan who espoused kings Aspelta and Anlamani, respectively. These possibilities are debated however because of the lack of direct evidence on the matter. Amanimalel's parents are equally uncertain, she could be a daughter of Atlanersa. Attestations Middle to fore ground: pyramid Nuri 22, conjecturally attributed to Amanimalel. Amanimalel is attested by a high lifesize statue of the queen, which was uncovered in April 1916 by George Andrew Reisner in a cache at the Gebel Barkal temple B 500 during a joint Harvard University–Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition. The statue, one of the great masterpieces of African art, shows the queen in a traditionally Egyptian striding pose, wearing a Nubian variation of an Egyptian dress that could have been sheathed in silver while the feet may have been adorned with golden sandals. The back pilar of the statue states that she is \\"beloved of Amun of Napata who resides in the sacred mountain\\", showing that the queen participated in the cult of Amun at Napata in a role that might have been related with that of God's Wife of Amun of the preceding Twenty-Fifth Dynasty. The inscription was under the aegis of a goddess whose portrait is damaged but may belong to Mut. The queen is shown holding a smaller statue of a god child wearing the double crown who might well be Khonsu, a son of Amun at Thebes, thereby associating the queen closely with the triad Amun, Mut and Khonsu. A second, very similar, quartzite statue is located at the Neues Museum of Berlin and is thought to belong to Amanimalel owing to the close resemblance between both representations. Tomb The tomb of queen Amanimalel has not been identified with any certainty. Reisner proposed that pyramid 22 at the royal necropolis of Nuri belongs to her. The pyramid was excavated in 1917. These works unearthed fragments of gold foil, small silver artefacts and beads.

The responsible authority is the Quebec Ministère du Développement durable, de l'Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques. The boundaries of proposed reserve were given in 2005, including Lake Pasteur but excluding Lake Walker. After public hearings, the September 2006 conservation plan showed the boundaries of the proposed biodiversity reserve expanded by to include Lake Walker and part of that lake's western shore. An area of Lake Walker and its western shore of was excluded due to mining titles. Location The proposed Lake Pasteur biodiversity reserve is located in the Côte-Nord administrative region between latitude 50°08' and 50°27' north and longitude 66°50' and 67°15' west. It is about north of the city of Port-Cartier. Including the expansion, it covers an area of in the unorganized territory of Lac-Walker within the Sept-Rivières Regional County Municipality. The reserve would contain Lac Morin in the southeast, Lake Pasteur, Lake Chevarie, and most of Lake Walker in the west. It would include part of the Pasteur River to the north of Lake Pasteur, but the northern boundary would exclude Lake Mouscoutchou and Lake Asquiche. Environment The proposed biodiversity reserve is in the Sainte Marguerite Plateau, a natural region in the Central Laurentian natural province. The terrain is hilly, covered with glacial till. A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the area of the reserve belonging to the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. Vegetation includes moors, black spruce (Picea mariana) forests, some stands of balsam fir (Abies balsamea), and stands of paper birch (Betula papyrifera) and poplar (Populus tremuloides) in the northern part. There are scattered peat bogs. The proposed reserve has of peatland. The region is used by boreal woodland caribou, and the proposed reserve is in a caribou area of interest. Human land use The proposed biodiversity reserve is within the Port-Cartier–Sept-Îles Wildlife Reserve. It is also in the Saguenay Beaver Reserve, where the Innu communities have special rights to hunt and trap fur animals. The privately-owned Cartier Railway crosses the territory. Under the Natural Heritage Conservation Act prohibited activities would include mining and extraction of oil and gas, forestry and production of hydroelectricity and other forms of energy. Other prohibitions would include introducing native or exotic wildlife. Introduction of fish for commercial purposes, or of non-native flora would require a permit. Any changes affecting the natural drainage and flow of water, and water quality would also be prohibited. Various other restrictions would apply, all aimed at preserving the natural environment.

In 1870 the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad founded Parsons, Kansas which quickly grew into a railway hub. This resulted in many citizens moving to nearby Parsons and on March 15, 1901 the Ladore post office closed as a result of the dwindling population.

The siblings choose not to remain in the haven, as they wish to find their parents, and learn of a prophecy where they are Liberators mentioned in a prophecy about the end of the New Order. Wisty and Whit begin to plan to take down the regime and reluctantly accept help from Byron, a former classmate who had heavily taken part in their persecution and had been changed into a weasel by Wisty. The trio eventually return to their home town, where they discover that the siblings' home has been demolished. There they discover that their parents can communicate with them through magic. During this process their seemingly worthless book and drum stick are transformed into a magic wand and spellbook. Byron is also changed back into a human and charged with looking after the siblings. =The Gift= When Whit and Wisty were imprisoned by the wicked forces of the totalitarian regime known as the New Order, they were barely able to escape with their lives. Now part of a hidden community of teens like themselves, Whit and Wisty have established themselves as leaders of the Resistance, willing to sacrifice anything to save kidnapped and imprisoned kids. Now the villainous leader of the New Order is just a breath away from the ability to control the forces of nature and to manipulate his citizens on the most profound level imaginable: through their minds. There is only one more thing he needs to triumph in his evil quest: the Gifts of Whit and Wisty Allgood. And he will stop at nothing to seize them. =The Fire= The siblings Whit and Wisty Allgood have every reason to want to take down The One, especially as he has taken everything and everyone from them. The One has continued his oppressive regime, going so far as to enforce a strict censorship where any form of creative output such as music or one's imagination are banned. A showdown is imminent between the three, which will decide the fates of their world. =The Kiss= With The One defeated, the siblings find that they face new challenges. Wisty is falling for a mysterious and possibly untrustworthy stranger named Heath and a new power now poses a threat to their world, a Wizard King that has come from the mountains to wage war. =The Lost= After defeating not only The One but also his father and son, Whit and Wisty have finally started to relax and take on new roles. However, their peace is soon shattered when it becomes evident that a new magical threat is threatening their city, resulting in the city turning against magic and the siblings seriously doubting themselves and each other.  Characters  =Book One= * Wisteria 'Wisty' Allgood - is a rebellious fifteen-year-old who is shocked to discover her magical ability. Her main power is the ability to burst into flames at random moments. She is the sister of Whitford 'Whit' Allgood. * Whitford 'Whit' Allgood - An eighteen-year-old 'All-American' athlete. He secretly struggles with depression after the unexplained disappearance of the girl he was in love with - Celia. Whit is a wizard, with the power to conjure food, objects, and most animals. He can also move objects with his mind. He is also a powerful healer. * Celia - Whit's girlfriend who disappeared mysteriously months before the beginning of the book. She was killed by the government but still exists as a Half-light. * Byron Swain - A classmate of the Allgoods, who betrays them to the government. Wisty turns him into a weasel (prompting her to call him the \\"Tattling Weasel\\" for the rest of the book). He realizes that he is also madly in love with Wisty and would do anything for her. * Janine - A teenage girl who is usually the leader of the resistance group and is described as a 'cute girl' by Whit. She is best friends with Margo and devastated when she is killed. * Sasha - Sasha first appears when he rescues the Allgood siblings in the Shadowland. He later lies to them in order to enlist their help in a jail break. Sasha is lanky, with overgrown black hair. * The One - the face of the government. Despite being a figure of great power and authority, he conducts himself politely and with quiet dignity. It is strongly implied that he is an evil wizard, possibly on a mission to eradicate all his enemies (meaning the Allgoods). He is after Wisty's Gift, which is controlling fire and electricity. He can also control water, earth, and wind. * Lost Ones - Warmth- consuming zombies, who were once humans who got lost in Shadowland. * Feffer - the loyal 'Hellhound' who accompanied Whit and Wisty through their first journey through Shadowland. * Ben and Eliza Allgood – Whit and Wisty's parents.

Its surface elevation is above sea level. The lake is extremely elongated, as are Lake Walker and Lake Quatre Lieues in the same watershed. The Pasteur River enters the north end of the lake, and leaves the south end to join the Aux Rochers River. Lake Pasteur is in the unorganized territory of Lac-Walker, in the Sept-Rivières Regional County Municipality. The lake is about north of Shelter Bay, now Port-Cartier, on the shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. Its name is mentioned in the Dictionnaire des rivières et des lacs de la province de Québec (Dictionary of Rivers and Lakes of the Province of Quebec) in 1925. It was named after the French chemist and biologist Louis Pasteur (1822–1895), who discovered microbial life and invented pasteurization. Environment The lake is in the proposed Lake Pasteur Biodiversity Reserve, in the Sainte Marguerite Plateau, a natural region in the Central Laurentian natural province. The terrain is hilly, covered with glacial till. A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the area of the reserve belongs to the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. The average annual temperature in the region is . The warmest month is July, when the average temperature is , and the coldest is January, with . Sediment A study of short gravity core samples along transects in the nearby fjord-lakes Pasteur, Walker and Pentecôte, published in 2018, evaluated the distribution of laminated post-glacial segments and the potential for formation of annual sedimentary layers, or varves. Four main types of sedimentary facies were identified: laminated, partially laminated, bioturbated and massive sediments. Lake Pentecôte mainly holds massive, partially laminated sediments. Lake Pasteur holds partially laminated sediments and non-annual sediments similar to varves. Lake Walker holds laminated sediments that probably are varves. The difference is probably due to the greater depth of Lake Walker, among other factors. History In November 1922 there was a deadly boating accident on the lake when the schooner Amoria was holed by early ice formed on the lake and sank. Ten people died, including Father Auguste Tortellier and Doctor Roméo Vézina.

Srebrenjak became a member Yugoslav Communist Party since 1928. After he killed a Yugoslav policeman in 1930 he left Yugoslavia and became a member of a group of Stalin's killers known as \\"liquidators\\" headed by Josip Broz Tito. When Axis forces occupied Yugoslavia in 1941 Srebrenjak returned to Yugoslavia and set up an NKVD centre in Zagreb, a part of Red Orchestra network. Tito considered him as an enemy and requested approval from Stalin to relieve Srebrenjak of that position, which was refused by Stalin. Subsequently, Srebrenjak was denounced to the Gestapo and Ustaše and he was captured. In captivity Srebrenjak was the first person to identify Tito as leader of Communist resistance movement in Yugoslavia to German and Ustaše authorities. To minimize further damage to his position Tito ordered to Stevo Krajačić to organize the murder of Srebrenjak and on 21 May 1942 Srebrenjak was killed in Ustaše prison. This murder allowed Tito to seize and stabilize his position of leader of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Early life Srebrenjak was born in 1903 in village Oprisavci near Slavonski Brod in Austria-Hungary (modern day Croatia). In 1928 he became a member of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia and in 1930 he murdered a police agent in Zagreb based on the order of the communist party.:\\"Ivan Srebrnjak — roden u selu Oprisavcima kraj Slavonskog Broda, godine 1903. kao obucar veé je 1928. godine postao clan KPJ. Dvije godine poslije, Srebrnjak je, po zadatku Partije, ubio nekog policijskog agenta u Zagrebu, pa je ..\\" Because of this murder he had to leave Yugoslavia. In the Soviet Union Srebrenjak became a Soviet citizen with name Petar Petrovič Antonov who was considered as one of the most capable intelligence officers. Initially, there were four centres of NKVD in Zagreb, parts of Red Orchestra, one operated by Andrija Hebrang, a second by Stevan Krajačić, a third by Josip Kopinič and a fourth by Ivan Srebrenjak. In France After leaving Yugoslavia Srebrenjak first went to Paris in France and joined a group of Stalin's killers known as \\"liquidators\\" headed by Josip Broz Tito, whose members were also Vittorio Vidali, Vlajko Begović and Ivan (Stevo) Krajačić. In Paris Srebrenjak killed Yugoslav agent Ilija Šumanovac. During World War II When Axis forces attacked Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Srebrenjak came from France to Zagreb to run an \\"information point\\" for Soviet intelligence in Zagreb. In Zagreb Srebrenjak became a head of Soviet intelligence network of the NKVD for the Balkans. Srebrenjak operated from this centre in Zagreb together with his wife Frančiška Srebrenjak (nee Klinc), who was a secret agent of the Yugoslav police and later Gestapo.:\\"Drugi, vojno-obveščevalni center je vodil Ivan Srebrnjak - Antonov s Frančiško Klinc, tajno sodelavko jugoslovanske policije in gestapa.\\" According to some sources she had a love affair with Stjepan Đaković, the elder son of Đuro Đaković. Srebrenjak was the first victim of Tito's ambitions to become Stalin's intelligence officer not only for Yugoslavia but also for other Balkan countries as well.:\\" Прва жртва шпијунских амбиција „друга Валтера\\" тада. постаје његов стари познаник Иван Сребрењак\\" In a telegram sent to Tito on 1 July 1941, Kopinič asserted that Popović, Končar and Srebrenjak are enemy spies.:\\"In a cable sent to Tito on July 1, Kopinić accused Popović, Koncar, and Srebrnjak (Antonov), an agent of the Soviet military counterintelligence, of being spies.\\" Srebrenjak believed that some of Tito's close associates, like Ivo Lola Ribar and Boris Kidrič were in service of the Yugoslav regime At the beginning of August 1941 Tito sent a telegram to Komintern insisting that Srebrenjak transfer all of his men to Communist Party of Yugoslavia control for training them as diversants because he did not organize this training himself and members of the party lost confidence in him.:\\"У току августа, Тито је упутио више депеша Коминтерни. Почет- ком месеца тражи да Иван Сребрењак (Антонов), који је у Загребу радио за совјетску обавештајну службу, а требало је, према договору са руководством КПЈ, ...\\" Tito hated Srebrenjak because he reported to Stalin about Tito's struggle for leadership of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. He requested from Stalin to relieve Srebrenjak from his post accusing him of being a Gestapo collaborator, but this attempt of Tito failed thanks to Srebrenjak's powerful Soviet patrons. Ustaše and Gestapo were already informed about activities of Srebrenjak by Slavko Đukić who was an associate of Srebrenjak, but it was Joco Đaković who was younger son of Đuro Đaković and who was arrested in December 1941 and identified Srebrenjak to Ustaše. In February 1942 Srebrenjak was arrested by Ustaše and tortured until he revealed names of Soviet agents in Croatia, Greece, Bulgaria and Italy. This was major success for Ustaše while Axis forces arrested ten to fifteen people based on the Srebrenjaks testimony, including Andrija Hebrang. Srebrenjak and Hebrang were the first people who identified leader of Communist Partisan forces to Ustaše and Axis special police as Josip Broz Tito, though Srebrenjak gave his name as Josip Brozović. Tito sent Krajačić to kill Srebrenjak. According to Cenčić, Srebrenjaks wife Franciška was released from Ustaše prison under suspicious circumstances, Hebrang was exchanged while Srebrenjak was killed in Ustaše prison against order of Josip Broz Tito.

It is the Focus on the Family affiliate organization (known as a Family Policy Council) for Maine, and its policy priorities today resemble that of this parent organization. It has worked to oppose same-sex marriage and adoption, to censor pornography, to oppose gambling, to legally permit LGBT employment discrimination, and to support conversion therapy.  History  = Founding = The Christian Civic League of Maine was founded in 1897 at Fort Fairfield, Maine for the purpose of \\"the suppression of the saloons.\\" At the League's first organizational meeting in Waterville, Bowdoin College president William DeWitt Hyde served as the first (temporary) chairman. A mass Temperance movement was sweeping the United States at this time, particularly Maine, which had passed the nation's first prohibition law in 1851. Many similar Temperance organizations were founded in the 19th century. The Temperance movement declined during Prohibition in the 1920s and 1930s, and most Temperance organizations ended. The Christian Civic League of Maine would prove to be unusually durable, advocating for the prohibition of alcohol into the 1980s. = Benjamin Bubar tenure = In March of 1949 Maine considered a bill legalizing the sale of wine at grocery stores. The Christian Civic League denounced this as \\"an attempt to Europeanize our consumption of liquor.\\" The attempt was defeated. The next month, Maine representative Ben Bubar introduced a prohibition bill. When his bill failed, Bubar became angry with the Christian Civic League for not supporting his bill strongly enough because they were focused on anti-gambling bills instead. Bubar had tried alcohol one time in his life, and his displeasure with the experience lead him to dedicate his career to teetotaling. Bubar would begin working at the Christian Civic League in 1952, serving as its head until 1983. Throughout the 1960 the Christian Civic League lead campaigns to outlaw the sale of alcohol on Sunday. They opposed a 1966 vote recount when an apparent vote miscount favored their side. Bubar ran for president in 1976 and 1980 as nominee of the Prohibition party. = Jasper Wyman tenure = A former member of the Maine House, Jasper Wyman, succeeded Bubar as the head of the League in 1983. Wyman turned the organization away from temperance and anti-gambling and toward issues of sexual morality, education, and welfare. LGBT activists in 1985 proposed a gay civil rights bill, LD 1249, although the strength of the Christian Civic League's lobbying caused debate among activists about the merit of even introducing the bill. LD 1249 did not pass. Wyman and the League sponsored a 1986 ballot measure to censor pornography. Under the proposed law, the sale of anything that appeals to \\"the prurient interest in sex\\" would have been punishable by a jail term of five years. A coalition of Maine feminist groups defeated the law. In 1992 Wyman called for a donor boycott of the United Way of Greater Portland because they banned sexual orientation bias. Wyman described himself in 1992 as opposed to abortion but \\"pro-choices.\\" Wyman said his organization had learned a lesson from the ineffectiveness of prohibition. \\"I don't see us resolving this by force of law. The only thing we can do is persuade women and men by offering better choices.\\" Wyman expressed support for sex education and welfare for pregnant women, and said that \\"pro-lifers must drop their unreasonable and indefensible opposition to birth control.\\" Wyman left the Civic League in 1994 to run for governor, but lost the primary to Susan Collins. = Michael Heath tenure = In 1997 the Maine Legislature passed a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Michael Heath, now head of the Christian Civic League, commented \\"discrimination is not necessarily a bad thing\\" because \\"it's appropriate to discriminate against wrongdoing.\\" Under Heath, the League pushed to overturn the law in 1998. Maine became the first US state to repeal a gay rights statute. Heath attributed the success to Maine residents who \\"have appropriate moral concerns with homosexuality and bisexuality.\\" The League handed out anti-gay leaflets at a 2003 civil rights conference where the play The Laramie Project was to be performed. They called it \\"homosexual indoctrination for 13-year-olds.\\" Michael Heath asked the public to send him \\"tips, rumors, speculation and facts\\" about lawmakers and other state officials who might be gay in 2004. Heath planned on outing gay officials on the League's website. He was widely criticized for this request and placed on one-month administrative leave from the League. In March 2005, Governor John Baldacci signed a law extending the Maine Human Rights Act to make discrimination based on sexual orientation illegal in employment, housing, credit, public accommodations and education. The Christian Civic League opposed the change, claiming the law would lead to gay marriage, though this was already banned under existing Maine law. The League held rallies in 2005 to condemn the LGBT protection, and supported a referendum to repeal it. \\"Outraged\\" by California's 2008 decision to legalize gay marriage, the League started a petition drive to permit discrimination against gay and lesbians in employment and other areas, to prohibit unmarried and gay adoption, to prohibit civil unions, and to reaffirm Maine's prohibition of gay marriage. Heath called all LGBT rights \\"special rights based on sexual misbehavior.\\" Maine would briefly legalize gay marriage in 2009, then repeal the measure in the same year. = Carroll Conley tenure = Under executive director Carroll Conley, the Christian Civic League of Maine made another push against gay marriage in 2012, when LGBT activists were working to restore its legality. The ballot question passed, and same-sex marriage has been legal in Maine since 2012. The League opposed the opening of casinos by Maine's tribal nations in 2018. In 2019, the organization attempted to keep conversion therapy (the pseudoscientific practice of trying to change an person's sexual orientation) legal in Maine.

She produced over 400 artworks, including a variety of landscapes, portraits, self-portraits and still lifes, which engage varyingly with the legacies of Expressionism and Post-Impressionism. Her paintings are particularly noted for their “poetic” and “lyrical” qualities, providing a “diary” of her geographical, emotional and psychological development. Throughout her life, Jones suffered from mental illnesses including bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety. Her difficulties with mental health severely limited the progression of her artistic career, and she was twice sectioned – with the GP on the occasion of her second sectioning describing her as \\"a woman who wears man's clothes\\". Nonetheless, her talents were recognised throughout her lifetime. Jones had a solo exhibition at the Ashmolean Museum in 1980, as well as notable reviews from David Carritt and K.J. Garlick. The British novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch even claimed that Jones would one day be ‘as famous as Van Gogh’. Family life Jones was born in London on 5th July 1927 to Ella and Samuel Robinson, “a successful but modest senior civil servant”. Her only brother, John Armstrong Robinson also became a civil servant, serving most notably as Head of Britain’s European Integration Department from 1968-70, and Assistant Under-Secretary of State from 1971-3, in which capacity he proved “indispensable to the most important diplomatic achievement of post- war Britain”, negotiating entry to the Common Market.Young, Hugo (1998), This Blessed Plot: Britain and Europe from Churchill to Blair, Overlook Press, pp.172-213. She later married John Jones, a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford and later the 38th Oxford Professor of Poetry (1978-83) and moved to Oxford with her new husband immediately, taking up residence in Holywell Cottage on St Cross Road.\\"Holywell Cottage (and Holywell Lodge), St Cross Road\\". The marriage produced two children, Jeremy and Janet. Education After leaving school, Jones briefly attended Saint Martin's School of Art in London, where she studied under the tutelage of Ruskin Spear, before opting to put aside her passion for painting, and matriculating at Girton College, Cambridge, where she read English. Artistic career In the early 1960s, after reading the letters of Vincent van Gogh, Jones was inspired to resume her interest in painting. Jones’s work is deeply engaged in the significant places of her life, in particular her surroundings in Primrose Hill, Oxford and the Devon countryside. David Carritt has described her “as an Expressionist, albeit a most restrained, unstrident Expressionist,” identifying in her work a characteristic array of “lyrical feelings – usually of happiness, sometimes of melancholy.” Jones’s work often features the same settings, which ‘she paint[ed] again and again, noting every change wrought by light and season but recording, too, the emotion which these changes awaken in her” and documenting “a world of becoming, not being”. Jones’s work was the subject of a 1980 solo exhibition at Oxford’s Ashmolean Museum. She also exhibited at the Bear Lane Gallery in Oxford and with the New Grafton and Boundary Galleries. In 1999, Duncan Campbell Contemporary Art held a studio sale of her work. During her lifetime, those in possession of Jones’s work included the Tolkien family, the Golding estate, as well as the critic John Carey, the Bishop John Oliver, the mathematician Harry Pitt, the literary agent and publisher Hilary Rubinstein, the novelist and academic Rachel Trickett, the American author and critic Diana Trilling, and academics Andrew Wallace-Hadrill and J.M. Wallace-Hadrill. Posthumous Revival In October 2020, a team led by Jones's grandson organised the first exhibition of her work in over twenty years at The Brownston Gallery, Modbury.

She is best known for her work as the librarian of the Bureau of Plant Industry and for compiling the Check List of Publication of the State Agricultural Experiment Stations on the Subject of Plant Pathology 1876-1920.  Early life  Eunice R. Oberly was born March 7, in Cairo, Illinois. Her father, John H. Oberly was editor of the \\"Cairo Bulletin\\" and she was the youngest of seven daughters. In 1885, he family moved to Washington, D.C. as her father took up the role of Civil Service Commissioner; he would later become Commission of Indian Affairs under President Cleveland. Oberly attended public school in DC and went on to graduate from Vassar College in June, 1900, where she served as class historian.  Career  Oberly began her career with the United States Department of Agriculture doing bibliographical work in the Division of Animal Industry. She was later appointed to librarian of the Division of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology. In 1908, the library of Vegetable Physiology and Pathology would be consolidated with the Office of Botanical Investigations to form the library of the Bureau of Plant Industry, of which Oberly was appointed librarian. The Bureau of Plant Industry Library's focus was not so much on books themselves, but rather on indexing and cataloging botanical literature and making it readily available to the workers and researchers of the bureau from libraries elsewhere in Washington, specifically the Library of Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture Library. Oberly's ambition was to make the holdings of libraries across the country more readily available to researchers. To this end, she contributed bibliographies on plant diseases for printing in the Phytopathology journal beginning in 1914 and which her staff continued after her death. She later developed a circular from the Bureau of a mimeographed list of botanical literature which contained full citations of all important botanical literature which had been received by the Washington libraries and was issued every two weeks to those who requested it. Oberly would go on to create two publications called \\"Bibliographical Contributions\\" which were put out by the Department of Agriculture Library. The first was published in 1918 and called Bibliographical Contributions Number 1: Check list of Publications of the Department of Agriculture on the Subject of Plant Pathology. She would then lead the development of Biographical Contributions Number 2: Check List of Publications of the State Agricultural Experiment Stations on the Subject of Plant Pathology 1876-1920, which was completed and published in 1922 by her assistant Jessie M. Allen, a year after Oberly's death. Oberly also wrote to improve the standing and reputation of the scientific library and to improve clarity in scientific literature writing. Outside of her librarian work, Oberly was socially and politically active in the Washington, D.C. area. Oberly was president of the Vassar Alumnae association of the D.C. area and she was a member of the American Library Association, which she joined in 1906. She became locally known for her work during World War I to help get ambulances to France and for her work with the suffragette movement as an organizer of the Woman Suffrage Council in D.C.  Honors and publications  Eunice Rockwood Oberly She served as representative on the Congressional Joint Commission on Reclassification of Federal Employees, where she helped successfully gain fairer recognition of library activities. She published multiple works on bibliography and agricultural librarianship: * Bibliographical Contributions Number 1: Check List of Publications of the Department of Agriculture on the Subject of Plant Pathology, 1837-1918 * The Agricultural Libraries Section of the American Library Association (1919) from Science (republished from the Bulletin of the American Library Association) * Bibliographical Contributions Number 2: Check list of Publications of the State Agricultural Experiment Stations on the Subject of Plant Pathology 1876-1920 * Libraries of Scientific Research Institutions Round Table (1921) from Bulletin of the American Library Association * Abstracts and Titles of Scientific Articles From the Librarian's Standpoint (1921) from Science * The Contribution of Librarians to Agricultural History and Research (1922) from The Library Journal  Death and legacy  Eunice R. Oberly died suddenly on November 5, 1921 at her home in Washington, D.C. After Oberly's death, her friends donated $800 in 1923 to the American Library Association as a memorial to her. The income from the donation was to be used as an annual reward to the compiler of the best bibliography of the year in the field of natural sciences or agriculture. The ALA board accepted the reward and transmitted it to the ALA endowment fund for investment and maintenance and a committee was assigned to administer it. The award is still administered biennially as the STS Oberly Award for Bibliography in the Agricultural or Natural Sciences.

From 1882 to 1921 all of Ireland was represented by a single side, the Ireland national football team, organised by the Irish Football Association (IFA). In 1920 Ireland was partitioned into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland. In 1922, The south of Ireland gained independence as the Irish Free State, later to become Republic of Ireland. Amid these political upheavals, a rival football association, the Football Association of Ireland (the F.A.I.), emerged in Dublin in 1921 and organised a separate league and later a national team. In 1923, during a period when the home nations had dis-affiliated from the governing body, Google books the FAI was recognised by FIFA as the governing body of the Irish Free State on the condition that it changed its name to the Football Association of the Irish Free State. At the same time, the IFA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis, regularly calling up Free State players. During this era at least one Northerner, Harry Chatton, also played for the Irish Free State and from 1936, the FAI began to organise their own all–Ireland team. Both teams now competed as Ireland and during this era at least 39 dual internationals were selected to represent both teams. Between 1928 and 1946 the IFA were not affiliated to FIFA and the two Ireland teams co-existed, never competing in the same competition. In April 1951, FIFA decreed that the IFA team could not select \\"citizens of Eire\\". An exception was for British Home Championship games, as a 1923 IFAB agreement at Liverpool prevented FIFA intervention in relations between the four Home Nations. However, the exception would only apply \\"if the F.A. of Ireland do not object\\", and was never availed of. At FIFA's 1953 congress, its Rule 3 was amended so that an international team must use \\"that title ... recognised politically and geographically of the countries or territories\\". The FAI initially claimed Rule 3 gave them the right to the name Ireland (see names of the Irish state), but FIFA subsequently ruled neither team could be referred to as Ireland, decreeing that the FAI team be officially designated as the Republic of Ireland, while the IFA team was to become Northern Ireland. The IFA objected and in 1954 was permitted to continue using the name Ireland in Home Internationals, based on the 1923 agreement. This practice was discontinued in the late 1970s.Matthew Taylor (2008). The Association Game: A History of British Football. Harlow:Pearson Education Ltd.

Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) is the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world. Famous PSG fans include former French President Nicolas Sarkozy and retired NBA player Tony Parker. Lacking a big passionate fanbase, the club began offering cheaper season tickets to young supporters in 1976. These fans were placed in the Kop K, located in the K section of the Paris stand at Parc des Princes. Following an increase in ticket prices, Kop K supporters moved to the Boulogne stand in 1978, and the Kop of Boulogne (KoB) was born. There, the club's first Italian-style ultra group, Boulogne Boys, was founded in 1985. Other KoB groups, however, took British hooligans as dubious role models and violence rapidly escalated. PSG supporters' groups have been linked to football hooliganism ever since. PSG owners Canal+ responded in 1991 by encouraging and financing non-violent fans of the KoB stand to take place in the Auteuil stand at the other end of Parc des Princes. The Virage Auteuil was born, alongside Supras Auteuil, its most notorious ultras. At first the measure worked but, slowly, a violent rivalry arose between the two stands. Things came to a head in 2010 before a match against Olympique de Marseille in Paris. Boulogne fan Yann Lorence was killed following a fight between groups from both stands outside Parc des Princes, forcing PSG president Robin Leproux to take action. The club exiled the supporters' groups from Parc des Princes and banned them from all PSG matches in what was known as Plan Leproux. It made PSG pay the price in terms of atmosphere, with one of Europe's most feared venues now subdued. For their part, former Virage Auteuil supporters formed the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016, with the aim of reclaiming their place at the stadium. In October 2016, after a six-year absence, the club agreed to their return. Grouped in the Auteuil end of the stadium, the CUP currently is the only ultra association officially recognized by PSG. The ultra movement has also started to come back to life in the Boulogne stand. New groups Block Parisii, Paname Rebirth and Résistance Parisienne are trying to convince the club of relaunching the Kop of Boulogne. Supporters' groups Paris Saint-Germain is the most popular football club in France with 22% of fans identifying as Parisians. Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille come second with 20%, while Olympique Lyonnais is third with 14%. PSG is also one of the most widely supported teams in the world with 35 million supporters worldwide, more than any other French club. The Parc des Princes has been the home stadium of the capital club since 1974. The pitch of the stadium is surrounded by four covered all-seater stands, officially known as Tribune Borelli, Tribune Auteuil, Tribune Paris and Tribune Boulogne. Historically, PSG's most hardcore fans have occupied the Auteuil and Boulogne stands. Boulogne Boys, Supras Auteuil and the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) have been the club's most famous supporters' groups. PSG also has a large number of fan clubs in France and worldwide, called PSG Fan Clubs. =Active= * Tribune Auteuil ** Collectif Ultras Paris (2016) *** CUP gathers 7 groups: **** K-Soce Team (2007) **** Le Combat Continue (2012) **** Liberté Pour les Abonnés (2010) **** Nautecia (2012) **** Parias Cohortis (2013) **** Porte 411 (2017) **** Ultras Paname (2017) * Tribune Paris ** 3 groups: *** Handicap PSG (2005) *** Le Club des Amis du PSG (1975) *** PSG Grand Sud (1995) * Tribune Borelli ** 1 group: *** PSG Junior Club (2012) * Tribune Boulogne ** 3 groups: *** Block Parisii (2017) *** Paname - ReBirth (2018) *** Résistance Parisienne (2019) * Banned from Parc des Princes ** 1 group: *** Karsud (1994) Virage Auteuil's tifo against Marseille in September 2006. =Dissolved= * Before Parc des Princes ** 1 group: *** Le Club des Associés (1970–1972) * Tribune Auteuil ** 12 groups: *** Auteuil Fanatics (1989–1991) *** Auteuil Rouge (2008–2009) *** Dragon's (1993–1997) *** Grinta (2009–2010) *** Incorrigibles Gaulois (1991–1992) *** Kriek (1999–2010) *** Lista Nera Paris (2009–2017) *** Lutèce Falco (1991–2010) *** Microbes Paris (2006–2017) *** Supras Auteuil (1991–2010) *** Tigris Mystic (1993–2006) *** Titans (1993–2010) * Tribune Paris ** 5 groups: *** Authentiks (2002–2010) *** Brigade Paris (2006–2010) *** Hoolicool (1993–2013) *** Juniors PSG / Kop K (1976–1978) *** Puissance Paris (2003–2010) * Tribune Borelli ** 2 groups: *** Capitals (1993–1998) *** Titi-Fosi (1995–2018) * Tribune Boulogne ** 23 groups: *** Army Korps (1991–1993) *** Boulogne Boys (1985–2008) *** Block B (1994) *** Casual Firm (1993–2010) *** Commando Loubard (2003–2010) *** Commando Pirate Paris (1985–1993) *** Crazy Gang (1997–2000) *** Firebirds (1986–1993) *** Gavroches de Paris (1986–2010) *** Génération Parisienne (1994–1998) *** Head-Hunter (1989–1992) *** Indépendants Boulogne Rouge (1993–2000) *** Kaos (1993–1995) *** Layache Family (2001–2010) *** Milice Paris (2006–2010) *** Parc Kaos (1994–1996) *** Paris Assas Club (1989–2010) *** Pitbull Kop (1989–1992) *** Rangers (1992–2010) *** Section Cigogne (1997–2010) *** S.K.

History =Early years= Boulogne Boys (left) and Titi-Fosi (right) in 2007. During their first three years of existence, Paris Saint-Germain were fan-owned and had 14,820 socios (members), who paid an annual fee of 25 to 40 francs (4 to 6 euros). The socios were the club's first supporters. As such, they founded Le Club des Associés (The Club of Socios) to organize travels for PSG home and away matches. It was PSG and France's first supporters' group. More than 2,000 socios attended the club's first match ever on 1 August 1970. It was a friendly against Quevilly (1–3 loss) at Stade Jean-Bouin. After PSG's 2–1 win over Brest in the 1970–71 French Division 2 in October 1970, players from the visiting team complained about the hostile atmosphere produced by the home supporters. The Parisian players were delighted, though. PSG defender Roland Mitoraj told reporters in February 1971 that he had never experienced this kind of support when he played for Saint-Étienne. In May 1971, for the decisive top-of-the-table clash against Rouen, 5,000 socios travelled to Normandy. The following season, the club's first in Ligue 1, PSG faced Lille in January 1972 as both sides battled to avoid relegation. PSG won 3–1 with the 1,200 socios in attendance unfurling a banner that read \\"PSG salutes Lille! Long live football and may the best one win!\\" But the club split shortly after and PSG were administratively relegated to Division 3. Paris FC stayed in Ligue 1 and an overwhelming majority of socios preferred to support them. In consequence, Le Club des Associés ceased to exist as well. PSG still had some supporters, though. They surprised the players with streamers and trumpets during their French Cup match against Rouen in Mantes in January 1973. On 10 November 1973, PSG played their first match at Parc des Princes against Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star, winning 3–1. Before kickoff, the team warmed up in front of their fans at the Boulogne stand. It was the beginning of a tradition that still stands today. PSG returned to Ligue 1 in 1974, immediately moving into the Parc as Paris FC had been relegated that same year. On 13 August 1974, PSG recorded a 2–2 draw against Metz in front of nearly 14,000 spectators during their maiden home match in the top-flight. The club's oldest active supporters' group, Le Club des Amis du PSG (The Club of Friends of PSG), was founded in January 1975. Its members settled in the Paris stand with a banner: \\"The Spirit Club.\\" =Kop of Boulogne= Back then, the majority of people attending Parc des Princes were casual spectators or away supporters, and the stadium was only full when Paris faced more prestigious sides like Saint-Étienne, Nantes, Olympique de Marseille or Stade de Reims. In response, the club put in place an attractive subscription plan called Young PSG Supporters in 1976, placing its subscribers in the K section, the first fan-dedicated space at Parc des Princes. They named this section the Kop K in reference to the famous Spion Kop stand in Anfield that groups the supporters of Liverpool. Kop K went from 500 subscribers against Reims in September 1976 to 3,000 members in early 1977. Following an increase in ticket prices in 1978, the club allowed Kop K supporters to move to the Boulogne stand, and the Kop K became the Kop of Boulogne (KoB). PSG players had been warming up there since 1973, so the supporters were logically invested in being closer to their idols. With the transformation of Auteuil into a second stand reserved for PSG fans in 1991, players have warmed up there too. United under a bulldog's head on top of the French flag, the KoB was mainly composed of three types of fans: Italian-style ultras (e.g. Boulogne Boys, Gavroches, Firebirds, Rangers, Tifo e Stupido, Sus Scrofa, Kaos and S.K.); English-inspired kopistes (e.g. Paris Assas Club, Head-Hunter, Génération Parisienne, Parc Kaos, Section Cigogne, Crazy Gang and Layache Family); and hooligans influenced by casual culture, far-right views and racist leanings (e.g. Commando Pirate, Pitbull Kop, Army Korps, Casual Firm, Indépendants Boulogne Rouge, Block B, Commando Loubard and Milice Paris). Founded in 1985, Boulogne Boys was the KoB's first supporters' group. It was also PSG's first ultra group and one of the oldest of its kind in France, alongside Marseille's Commando Ultra (1984) and Nice's Brigade Sud (1985). The group's distinctive trait was welcoming the players' entrance to the pitch with tifo choreography, which included flares, flags, banners and chants. Despite being Boulogne's most high-profile group, its style didn't fit the image of the stand, being more eye-catching and less confrontational. Nonetheless, Boys was the stand's biggest animators. They were also a controlling force and a mediator in the stand, and had an unpolitical stance in the highly politicized Boulogne. Members of Boulogne Boys left the group in 1986 and created Gavroches that same year. Gavroches and Rangers were ultras as well but inspired by real English kopistes, with sheer vocal volume and scarf-waving as their chief medium for support. They would mainly make use of flags, flares and chants like \\"Le Parc est à nous\\" (\\"The Parc is ours\\"), which were battle cries to intimidate the visiting teams and its supporters. If they prepared tifos from time to time, they preferred to use their money to help a member in trouble with justice. =Virage Auteuil= At the beginning of the 1990s, Paris Saint-Germain were enjoying their worst attendance record since reaching Ligue 1 in 1974. The violence and racism in the Kop of Boulogne took the blame for this situation. To give non-violent and non-racist supporters in Boulogne an alternative, as well as boost the attendance levels, new owners Canal+ backed the creation of the Virage Auteuil in 1991. Before this date, Auteuil was mainly composed of casual spectators and away fans despite the presence of PSG fan group Auteuil Fanatics in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Encouraged and financed by the club, Supras Auteuil, Lutèce Falco and Incorrigibles Gaulois were the first ultra groups of the new stand. They were soon joined by Sus Scrofa in 1992, then by Dragon's, Tigris Mystic, Titans, Kaos and S.K. in 1993. Karsud in 1994 and Kriek in 1999 completed the Virage Auteuil roster. 15th anniversary tifo of Supras Auteuil in 2006. The measure worked; violence bottomed, while attendance steadily grew, peaking in 2000. But even though Auteuil was a way for the club to fight against racism, it proved to be a mistake in the long run. Rather than kick out the racists, the club just tacitly accepted that Boulogne was a white-only stand, preferring to move members of ethnic minorities to the Auteuil stand, located opposite to the KoB. Auteuil ultras were racially mixed, largely left-wing, anti-racist and represented Parisian diversity with immigrants or sons of immigrants. In contrast to the English-inspired KoB, the Auteuil stand modelled after the Italian ultra culture. Auteuil ultras made use of banners, flares, chants and other expressions of tifo, which means organized and choreographed support of the team. Symbolically, they referred to the stand as Virage Auteuil. \\"Virage\\" is the French equivalent for the Italian word \\"curva.\\" Supras Auteuil, the stand's biggest group, summed up this philosophy; Supras is the contraction of \\"SUPporters\\" and \\"ultRAS.\\" Virage Auteuil gradually became a reference within the Panorama Ultra Français (French Ultra Panorama or PUF). In April 1995, PSG met A.C. Milan at Parc des Princes in the UEFA Champions League semifinals. Before kickoff, Auteuil welcomed their players by unveiling a spectacular tifo, which was voted the \\"Best European Tifo\\" of the 1994–95 season by the Torcida International Fans Organization (TIFO). The tifo against Steaua Bucharest in August 1997 was also a big landmark for Auteuil. Auteuil grew in the shadow of the Kop of Boulogne. Both stands competed for visual and vocal dominance, but Auteuil never questioned the authority of Boulogne. As a result, these two fan scenes, with their radically different racial composition and political views, coexisted in relative peace during the 1990s and early 2000s. They even began exchanging chants and mottos such as \\"Ici, c'est Paris!\\" (\\"This is Paris!\\") in 1997, becoming a trademark of PSG games at Parc des Princes. In 2001, the Auteuil stand became \\"too small\\" and a new generation wishing to follow the Ultra model of Virage Auteuil settled in the neighboring stand: the G section of the Paris stand. The first group, Authentiks, appeared in January 2002 and grew very quickly. They were joined by another ultra group, Puissance Paris, in 2003. =Boulogne-Auteuil war= Tigris Mystic banner Lutèce (left), Tigris (bottom) and Supras (right) in 2004. It all changed in May 2003, when Tigris Mystic celebrated their 10th anniversary with a banner that read \\"The Future Belongs to Us.\\" Subtly aimed at Boulogne, this message was a war declaration for KoB hooligans: Auteuil was the future, while Boulogne was the past. The power struggle that opposed PSG's first historical supporters of Boulogne against the newer ultras of Auteuil was just a cover for the real problem: the racial tension that had existed between the stands for many years. Suddenly, the clashes outside Parc des Princes were largely between hooligans of the same team, unlike anywhere else in Europe. One side of the ring featured Boulogne hooligan firms Casual Firm, Commando Loubard and Milice Paris whose members were far-right, white supremacists looking to \\"rid the suburbs of blacks and Arabs.\\" The other side featured some members of Auteuil multiethnic group Tigris Mystic, whose initially peaceful anti-racist and left-wing ultras then chose to fight back. They had began clashing with hooligans from other teams at the start of the 2000s. The first skirmishes between Auteuil and Boulogne took place right after the banner, but were cut short by a short-lived truce to fight against the new security policy of the club in 2004. Jean-Pierre Larrue, PSG's head of security, was determined to clear Parc des Princes of hooligans and racists. His idea was to dissolve all the Auteuil and Boulogne groups and recreate two, one unique for each stand, with responsible persons to lead them. But fans menaced mayhem and even sent death threats to PSG president Francis Graille. He eventually lost the backing of his bosses, who pulled the plug on the security plan and fired Larrue. The conflict resumed immediately afterwards and incidents occurred wherever PSG played during the 2005–06 season. In October 2005, Casual Firm hooligans thrashed the headquarters of Tigris Mystic, to which the latter responded by attacking a group of Boulogne hooligans in February 2006. Racism in the Kop of Boulogne had become intolerable that campaign and other Virage Auteuil ultras began to denounce it, vocally following Tigris Mystic when they sang \\"La Marseillaise\\" while brandishing their French identity card. In spite of this, the stand didn't support the violent actions of Tigris members, which by then had brought them into conflict not only with KoB hooligans but also with big ultra group Boulogne Boys, and even with Auteuil group Karsud, who had close ties with their far-right peers in Boulogne. Since the club directors were scarcely supportive as well, Tigris Mystic decided to self-dissolve in July 2006 after several months of violent incidents. Later, in 2008, several ex-Tigris created a new group, Auteuil Rouge, which became Grinta in 2009. Dissolution of Boulogne Boys Lens in 2008. With the disbanding of Tigris Mystic, PSG officials thought that peace would finally return. The reality, however, was that revenge and hatred had taken over the stadium; Boulogne and Auteuil could no longer stand each other. Tigris was gone but other Auteuil supporters had become violent as well, while racism in the KoB was out of control. In November 2006, a few months after Canal+ sold the club to Colony Capital, things really began to fall apart when PSG fan Julien Quemener died. The Boulogne affiliate was among a large group of fans that racially harassed a Hapoel Tel Aviv supporter after the Israeli club defeated PSG at Parc des Princes. A police officer intervened to help him and killed Quemener in self- defence. Following Quemener's death, more strict security measures were implemented, including stadium bans and police controls on matchdays. This led to a relative cease of fire between the two stands. They even fought together against Twente and Marseille hooligans in December 2008 and October 2009, respectively. Tensions, however, were slowly mounting again in the background. Supras Auteuil subgroup K-Soce Team was born in 2007. Brandishing flags of Algeria and Palestine, they embodied the growing politicization and left-wing radicalization of the Auteuil stand, antagonizing with that of Boulogne. Like Tigris Mystic before them, K-Soce Team responded to the racism in the stadium by clashing with Boulogne hooligans. Politicians had long been looking for a scapegoat and finally found it when Boulogne Boys outraged France in March 2008 during the 2008 Coupe de la Ligue Final. They unfurled a banner which referred to Lens fans as pedophiles, jobless and incestuous. The banner was certainly offensive, but it was its timing that ultimately sealed the fate of the ultra group. Recently elected French president Nicolas Sarkozy was in attendance that evening. He had promised back in 2006 that, if he won the elections, he would rid PSG of racists and hooligans. Sadly for Boys, they gave him the perfect excuse to start. The French government dissolved them in April 2008; it was the end of one of the most legendary supporters' group in France. \\"This Is The End\\" Titi-Fosi, one of the few groups to survive Plan Leproux. With Boulogne Boys gone, the club lost a mediator between Boulogne and Auteuil, as well as a controlling force over Casual Firm, Commando Loubard and Milice Paris hooligans. In December 2009, hostilities reignited in an away match at Bordeaux, when a Boulogne member exhibited a flag with a Celtic cross while surrounded by Auteuil fans, who then attacked him. He turned out to be an influential figure in the KoB and promised revenge on Auteuil. In January 2010, members of Supras Auteuil were attacked by Boulogne hooligans in Lille. Days later, during the next match against Monaco at Parc des Princes, the KoB mocked Supras Auteuil by chanting \\"Supras, Supras, we fucked you.\\" But, unlike Tigris Mystic in 2005–06, Supras Auteuil had the support of Grinta and Authentiks. Both stands clashed again in February 2010 before a match against Marseille. After yet another attack from Boulogne hooligans, the aforementioned Auteuil groups led a countercharge which culminated in the lynching of KoB member Yann Lorence. The club immediately reacted by banning all its fans from travelling to away games. In April 2010, the French government dissolved five PSG supporters' groups : Commando Loubard and Milice Paris of Boulogne, Supras Auteuil and Grinta of Auteuil, and Authentiks of the Paris stand. PSG president Robin Leproux began to work on an anti-violence plan called Tous PSG (All PSG) in May 2010. It became known as Plan Leproux. Auteuil groups Lutèce Falco, Kriek and Karsud organized peaceful march in response. On 15 May 2010, around 1,000 supporters descended on Parc des Princes before the club's last match of the 2009–10 season against Montpellier that same day. During the game, groups from Auteuil and Boulogne displayed one last act of defiance, throwing hundreds of red distress flares to the pitch, forcing play to be halted for several minutes. Lutèce Falco also unfurled a banner which simply stated \\"This Is The End.\\" For twelve of these groups this was their last appearance at the stadium as they decided to disband afterwards due to intense repression and media persecution: Casual Firm, Gavroches, Layache, Paris Assas Club, Rangers, Section Cigogne and Tifo e Stupido from Boulogne; Kriek, Lutèce Falco and Titans from Auteuil; Brigade Paris and Puissance Paris from the Paris stand. =Plan Leproux= Liberté Pour les Abonnés Plan Leproux was announced later that week, marking the end of the 13,000 supporters grouped in Auteuil and Boulogne, of which only 400 were hooligans. It made PSG and Parc des Princes pay the price in terms of atmosphere, with one of Europe's most feared venues now subdued. Many of the supporters who were frozen out by the club formed a group called Liberté Pour les Abonnés (Freedom for Season Ticket Holders) and boycotted matches until they could again choose where to sit. PSG supporters protesting against the club in March 2011. The club, meanwhile, continued its pre-season reformation of Auteuil and Boulogne, removing murals and commemorative plaques dedicated to supporters' groups, deceased members and former players. The transition wasn't smooth. 22,689 spectators showed up for PSG's first match of the 2010–11 season, and attendance remained low. By January 2011, PSG allowed supporters' groups in the stands again, as long as they signed the Charte 12, a list of strict rules and regulations. The first group to agree to Charte 12 was Hoolicool, followed by Titi-Fosi and Vikings 27. But none of these groups were located in Auteuil or Boulogne. PSG also partnered with anti-racism organization SOS Racisme to help run security at matches and keep track of any racist behaviour. In May 2011, ahead of the 2011–12 season, the State of Qatar bought PSG through its shareholding organization Qatar Sports Investments (QSI). Attendance levels soared thanks to big-money signings like Javier Pastore and a promising UEFA Champions League project to make PSG a big European team. Liberté Pour les Abonnés welcomed the Qatari owners and their efforts, but maintained that a big club was nothing without their fanbase. As soon as they arrived, however, QSI further developed Plan Leproux by elaborating a blacklist of PSG supporters banned from the club's games. Considered illegal by the National Commission on Informatics and Liberty, the French government validated the controversial document in April 2015. Police and all French clubs have access to the list for them to prevent these fans from purchasing tickets for PSG home or away matches. Women and ultras Between 2010 and 2016, with the impossibility for the ultras to support the men's team at home or away, the PSG faithful turned to Paris Saint-Germain Féminine, and to a lesser extent to the Paris Saint-Germain Youth Academy sides, being the very rare case of fan groups supporting their club's women's team. Liberté Pour les Abonnés and Nautecia, which were among several groups that reunited Boulogne and Auteuil supporters, were behind this initiative. PSG ultras have also occasionally attended big matches of the club's handball team, Paris Saint-Germain Handball, ever since it was bought by PSG owners Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in 2012. In 2010, unlike some fans who decided to cheer for other Parisian clubs such as Paris FC or Créteil, Liberté Pour les Abonnés and Nautecia noticed there wasn't much enthusiasm around the women and chose to stay with PSG by supporting them in France and abroad, from league clashes against rivals Olympique Lyonnais to the 2015 UEFA Women's Champions League Final in Berlin. A marriage of convenience at first, the ultras began to really enjoy supporting the women for three main reasons: their proximity compared to the men, being able to easily approach female players; their appreciation for the fans, always thanking them after every match; and their solidarity with the ultra movement, publicly supporting a return to Parc des Princes for men's team games in interviews and social media, in contrast to male players whose communication was more controlled by the club. Even after being allowed back into the stadium in 2016, they have continued to support the women under the banner of Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP). In March 2017, they attended the Champions League quarterfinals return game against Bayern Munich at Parc des Princes. They were also part of the record 19,192 spectators in attendance for the semifinals against Barcelona the following month. Later that same season, 300 PSG ultras cheered the team during the 2017 UEFA Women's Champions League Final against Lyon in Cardiff in June 2017. =Collectif Ultras Paris= Parc des Princes return The Parisian ultra movement slowly began to reassemble. The remaining supporters' groups met the team in front of the training ground whenever possible and went to away games, usually outside France. Many of these associations would then join forces and form the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016 with the aim of returning to Parc des Princes. The groups in question were former Virage Auteuil associations K-Soce Team, Microbes Paris, Parias Cohortis and Karsud, as well as those created after the implementation of Plan Leproux: Liberté Pour les Abonnés, Lista Nera Paris, Nautecia and Le Combat Continue. Former Kop of Boulogne groups were also invited, but they declined to partake in the CUP initiative as an entity. Despite this, former Boulogne supporters are in the CUP as individuals. Romain Mabille, member of K-Soce Team, was elected president of the CUP a few weeks after its foundation. PSG and the CUP first agreed a Parc des Princes return for the club's 2–0 victory over Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the start of October. Around 150 ultras were allowed to enter the Auteuil stand and the stadium saw supporters encouraging for the whole game after six years of absence. The spark flew over to the Boulogne end, too, and both stands even exchanged chants just like they used to do before the Boulogne and Auteuil war: \\"Boulogne is Paris,\\" \\"Auteuil is Paris.\\" The club believed that the lack of enthusiasm in the stadium was partially guilty for their recurring, disappointing early exits from the UEFA Champions League, so PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi and prominent players, including team captain Thiago Silva, pushed for the return of the ultras. Grouped in the Auteuil end of the stadium, the CUP is the only ultra association officially recognized by PSG and has around 3,000 members. Internal disputes and boycott A new group, Ultras Paname, joined the CUP in April 2017. A month later, however, Lista Nera Paris and Microbes Paris left the CUP due to internal disagreements and self-dissolved, while Karsud was excluded from the group and continued on their own. In August 2017, the club allowed the CUP to hold season tickets together in the Auteuil end for the first time since 2010. In June 2018, the club gave the CUP permission to remake the murals inside the corridors of the Virage Auteuil. Supporters began making them in 2005, but were erased in 2010 as part of Plan Leproux. These paintings paid tribute to iconic players, ultra groups and deceased members. The following month, PSG also authorized the CUP to unfurl the group's own banner on the billboards of the upper part of Auteuil. Other highlights were two Dragon Ball tifos featuring Goku and Shenlong to welcome the players in February 2018 and October 2019. Tensions between PSG and the CUP resurfaced in late October 2019, when the latter announced a boycott of all club matches until further notice after, according to the group's statement, \\"yet another act of provocation orchestrated by people who have never digested the return of the ultras.\\" The following day, the CUP protested in front of the PSG headquarters and skipped the team's next match, a decision copied by Boulogne groups Block Parisii and Paname Rebirth. The ultras demanded the departure of both security company OLIPS from the Auteuil stand and two PSG employees, including Jerome Sursin, the club's assistant security director and former Kop of Boulogne member. In November 2019, OLIPS announced the end of its collaboration with PSG, which in turn maintained the two employees targeted by their ultras. Nevertheless, the CUP put an end to their boycott. Cavani controversy and Mabille's departure In early October 2020, CUP president and leader of subgroup K-Soce Team, Romain Mabille, announced his departure from the ultra group he had led since its creation in 2016. His decision came after internal differences within the CUP. The banners deployed across Paris before September's Le Classique sparked tensions between the subgroups because they weren't collectively debated and validated. Mabille and K-Soce were not involved in this action, which notably aroused indignation from French Sports Minister Roxana Mărăcineanu. However, Mabille's exit had more to do with his stance over PSG idol Edinson Cavani, whose controversial departure from the club had left the CUP divided. Worshipped by the ultras, “El Matador” surprisingly decided against signing a short-term contract extension to play the remaining matches of the coronavirus-stricken 2019–20 UEFA Champions League with the team. Feeling mistreated by the club, Cavani left without acknowledging his time at PSG or even thanking the supporters. Cavani eventually said his goodbyes, but the unilateral decision of a CUP subgroup to praise the Uruguayan striker with a banner was apparently the last straw for Mabille, who was amongst those opposed to pay him tribute. Nicolas Boffredo, a K-Soce Team affiliate like Mabille, was elected as the new president a few days later. Nicknamed \\"Bobo,\\" he has attended PSG matches since he was 9 years old. He joined the ultra movement in the 2000s, first frequenting the Virage Auteuil and then becoming a member of the Supras Auteuil in 2002. Thereafter, Boffredo has also been known as \\"Monsieur Tifos\\" for imagining, organising and making tifos for every ultra group he has been part of. Indeed, he would go on to be a founding member of both the K-Soce Team in 2007 and the CUP in 2016. =New groups in Boulogne= In September 2017, the first Boulogne supporters' group since Plan Leproux, Block Parisii, was born. They were soon joined by Paname Rebirth in 2018 and Résistance Parisienne in 2019. These new associations, which according to their leaders are not linked with former Boulogne groups, aim to convince the club of relaunching the Kop of Boulogne, in the same way they did with the Virage Auteuil and the Collectif Ultras Paris. PSG has not officially recognize these groups out of fear of provoking a new war between Boulogne and Auteuil. Indeed, the relationship with the CUP didn't start well, with the latter stealing part of Block Parisii's paraphernalia before returning them. The CUP initially believed that, like former Boulogne groups, the Block were also made of far-right extremists and racists. However, exchanges during away games smoothed the situation as the CUP realized that the new group has an apolitical, nonreligious and anti- violence stance, and its members are Arab, black and white. In March 2018, during PSG's UEFA Champions League tie against Real Madrid at Parc des Princes, both groups collaborated. Several CUP ultras took place in the Boulogne stand to chant alongside Block members. Hooliganism and racism =Hooligan firms= Most Kop of Boulogne (KoB) supporters were poor disaffected white men who made this stand their meeting point thank to its low admission fees. Some of them were influenced by English casual culture. Typified by hooliganism and the wearing of expensive designer clothing, this culture was exported by Liverpool fans in the late 1970s and early 1980s. As a result, the Boulogne stand developed into the home of French hooliganism in the mid-1980s. Rival fans, who had always sat in Boulogne, had to be moved across the field to Auteuil, which became the away stand until 1991. This prompted KoB hooligans to form away parties that sneaked through the stands and attacked the visitors. Kop of Boulogne, the home of French hooliganism. PSG's first hooligan firm, Commando Pirate, was founded in 1986, followed by violent ultra group Firebirds later that same year. Infiltrated by far-right extremists since the mid-1980s, the Kop of Boulogne became overtly racist in 1989 with the creation of hooligan firm Pitbull Kop by Serge Ayoub, leader of French far-right association Revolutionary Nationalist Youth (JNR), which advocated violence and white supremacy. In consequence, the KoB turned into a white-only stand with racist chants (such as \\"France for the French\\"), signs, and Nazi salutes as regular features. Pitbull Kop quickly disbanded in 1992, but its racist legacy continued in the stand. Hooligan group Army Korps was founded in 1991 and they would partake in one of French football's darkest moments two years later. The Caen incident in 1993 led to the dissolution of Commando Pirate, Army Korps and Firebirds by Sports minister Michèle Alliot- Marie. Casual Firm and Indépendants Boulogne Rouge (IBR) quickly filled their void in December 1993. These groups were behind most violent episodes of the 1990s. IBR self-dissolved in 2000, but Casual Firm were later joined by Commando Loubard in 2003 and Milice Paris in 2006. The latter two were dissolved by the French government in April 2010, while Casual Firm disbanded a month later. Created by the club in 1991 to counteract the racism in the stadium, the racially mixed and anti-racist Virage Auteuil stand eventually superseded the less visually impressive and more violent Kop of Boulogne. Nonetheless, Auteuil wasn't exempt from hooliganism and its first hooligan firm, Karsud, was founded in 1994. A few members of Tigris Mystic, initially a peaceful fan group created in 1993, slowly turned into hooligans too, clashing with thugs from other teams as well as those from the KoB and even against Auteuil peers Karsud. Unlike their politicized peers in the Boulogne stand, Auteuil hooligans started off as purists of urban violence. Simply put, they were apolitical at first. Over time they adopted left-wing ideas which radically opposed the KoB's far-right leanings, and a deadly conflict arose between the two stands during the 2000s. In July 2006, after several months of clashes with Boulogne hooligans, Tigris Mystic declared it self-dissolved. On the other hand, Karsud carried on and are currently the club's only group with hooligans' behaviours still on activity. PSG hooligans were among the most active in Europe until the club enforced a major anti-violence plan in 2010. =Incidents= Before Plan Leproux The first hooligan incidents from Paris Saint-Germain supporters took place during an away game against Nancy in January 1977. Since then, they have clashed with hooligans from all over France, most notably those from big teams such as Saint-Étienne, Nantes, Olympique Lyonnais, Nice and hated Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille. PSG radicals have also fought fans from smaller sides like Bastia, Auxerre, Rennes and Tours. In February 1984, PSG goons even clashed with English hooligans on the stands of Parc des Princes during an international match between France and England, leaving dozens injured. Boulogne hooligans were behind many racist incidents and clashes with the feared CRS riot police. In 1991, Arab fans were attacked by KoB hooligans. In August 1993, during a match against Caen, ten CRS officers were injured by PSG hooligans. The brawl began when they entered Boulogne to arrest a fan. Once inside, KoB thugs swarmed over the outnumbered policemen and kicked one of them into a coma. In January 2006, two Arab youths were assaulted by Boulogne thugs outside the entrance to the stand during a match against Sochaux. A few months later, six KoB hooligans ambushed a black man after a match at Le Mans in November. Two of the assailants received prison sentences. They also racially abused some of their own non-white players, most notably Afro-French goalkeeper Bernard Lama, Liberian striker George Weah and French midfielder of Indian origin Vikash Dhorasoo. PSG's ill-fated title celebration in May 2013. Progress in European competition during the 1990s and 2000s saw even more vicious fighting. The Parisian hooligans clashed with opposing thugs from Juventus, Anderlecht, Galatasaray, Chelsea, Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Rangers, CSKA Moscow, Hapoel Tel Aviv and Twente. Even worse, the club's own supporters had turned on each other as well. Following the deaths of two PSG fans, the club implemented an anti-violence plan in May 2010. Officially called Tous PSG (All PSG), but known by supporters as Plan Leproux, it exiled all fan groups from Parc des Princes and banned them from all club matches. After Plan Leproux Fan violence largely decreased after Plan Leproux, but incidents still occur. In May 2013, the club's league title celebrations at Trocadero plaza were cut short following fighting between PSG fans and riot police, leaving 30 people injured and leading to 21 arrests. In August 2012, Zlatan Ibrahimović's presentation saw clashes among rival factions of PSG supporters. Between 2010 and 2016, PSG fans also brawled with supporters of Dinamo Zagreb, Bayer Leverkusen and Chelsea. Following years of demonstrations against Plan Leproux, several fan groups formed the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) in February 2016. The club allowed their long-awaited comeback in October 2016 for PSG's 2–0 home league win over Bordeaux. The first incidents since their return occurred in April 2017. Some PSG ultras caused damage to areas of Parc Olympique Lyonnais during the 2017 Coupe de la Ligue Final, and the first cracks appeared in the Collectif Ultras Paris. A month later, Lista Nera Paris and Microbes Paris dissociated themselves from the CUP. A third association, Karsud, was excluded from the ultra group. CUP president, Romain Mabille, would later refer to Karsud members as \\"hooligans who didn't want to respect the code of conduct agreed with the club.\\" Ever since then, members of the CUP, mainly those from leading subgroup K-Soce Team, and Karsud have been in conflict. In October 2018, the CUP fought with Karsud and twinned Red Star Belgrade hooligan firm Delije near Parc des Princes after a 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage match. PSG reacted by imposing a one-year stadium ban and cancelling season tickets to the 100 CUP members involved, most of them issued from K-Soce Team. Affiliates of the latter association made headlines again in November 2019 when they attacked spectators who were wearing Olympique de Marseille jerseys or tracksuits during Marseille rapper Jul's concert at AccorHotels Arena. The CUP and Karsud have also clashed separately with thugs from Bayern Munich, Club Brugge, and Nantes. =Rivalries= Incidents between PSG and Galatasaray hooligans in 2001. Paris Saint-Germain supporters share intense rivalries with fans from Olympique de Marseille, Juventus, Anderlecht, Galatasaray and Chelsea. Since PSG and Marseille also have a fierce sporting rivalry, known as Le Classique, incidents have been more frequent. Among the most notable are the 146 arrests and nine policemen hospitalised during the French Cup semifinals in April 1995, the Marseille supporter who was left paralysed for life in October 2000 after being struck by a flying seat, and the PSG fan who was hit by a car in October 2009. The rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus supporters began in October 1983. PSG welcomed the Bianconeri in Paris for the 1983–84 European Cup Winners' Cup second round. During the match, Kop of Boulogne hooligans invaded the away stand and violently attacked the Italian ultras. They brawled again in the 1989–90 UEFA Cup last 16 and the 1992–93 UEFA Cup semifinals. In April 1993, Juventus hooligans unfurled a banner aimed at their PSG counterparts at the Stadio delle Alpi. So, before the return match at Parc des Princes two weeks later, PSG troublemakers were looking for payback. One Juve supporter was beaten unconscious. Prior to their 1992–93 UEFA Cup third round tie in November 1992 at Parc des Princes, dissolved Boulogne hooligan firm Commando Pirate had a twinning with Anderlecht ultra group O'Side since the early 1980s, and they would occasionally fight together against common enemies. But when O'Side attacked Virage Auteuil members, who were under the wing of Boulogne back then, everything changed. Commando Pirate and Boulogne peers Army Korps came to help Auteuil, severely injuring two Anderlecht fans. Seats flew between the visitors and Auteuil ultras during the game, while Boulogne hooligans clashed again with O'Side after the final whistle. Matches between Paris Saint-Germain and Galatasaray have been classed as high risk since their 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup last 16 match at Parc des Princes in October 1996. Attacked by Boulogne hooligans, the Turkish supporters got the better of them and a handful of PSG fans were seriously injured. The Parisians got their revenge in March 2001 during their 2000–01 UEFA Champions League second group stage match. After being provoked, Auteuil and Boulogne hooligans, at the time on good terms, attacked the Galatasaray followers in the stands. More than fifty Turks had to be hospitalized in the French capital. In December 2019, both teams met in Paris for the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League group stages and violence erupted in the streets, leaving one PSG fan with a head trauma and one Galatasaray supporter with a hand injury. During the match, PSG ultras mocked Galatasaray's elimination with a banner. But it was their attack on Chelsea hooligan firm Chelsea Headhunters that earned PSG hooligans high praise on web sites dedicated to football violence. In September 2004, a 150-strong PSG mob assaulted around 50 Chelsea hooligans before their 2004–05 UEFA Champions League group stage match in Paris, sparking a rivalry that still stands today. Both teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League quarter-finals. Before the first-leg match at Parc des Princes in April 2014, about 100 fans from each team, including members of former Boulogne hooligan firms, fought in a tourist area of the French capital. Two fans were injured. =Deaths= Julien Quemener Following a humiliating 4–2 loss in the UEFA Cup to Israeli club Hapoel Tel Aviv at Parc des Princes, PSG hooligans took the streets and targeted Jewish fans. A French-Jewish supporter of Hapoel, Yaniv Hazout, was surrounded, threatened and subjected to a barrage of racial abuse, when a plain-clothes black police officer, Antoine Granomort, stepped in to help him. Granomort wasn't wearing a police uniform and PSG radicals attacked him. He tried to break up the group with tear gas but was overpowered. Granomort then fired one shot, seriously injuring Mounir Boujaer before killing Julien Quemener. This episode shocked France. It was only the second fan-related death in the country after that of 1984 when a supporter was killed by a flare. Public opinion blamed the KoB, known for its racist and violent fans since the late 1970s. In turn, PSG supporters and French fans in general considered Quemener a martyr and demanded an inquiry. Prior to PSG's match at Nantes three days after the incident, Boulogne Boys paid their respects to Quemener by marching through the city to the stadium. A KoB banner in tribute of Julien Quemener in 2007. Initially, police said Julien Quemener was a member of Boulogne Boys and that this group had links to PSG's violent far-right fans in the KoB. Boys quickly denied the allegations. Later developments in the investigation showed that Quemener was close to Boulogne hooligan firms (Casual Firm, Commando Loubard and Milice Paris) and not Boulogne Boys. In February 2011, after more than four years of investigation, Antoine Granomort was acquitted of murder on the grounds of self-defence. Yann Lorence In February 2010, two hours before PSG's 3–0 home defeat to Marseille, the fratricidal war between Boulogne and Auteuil reached a point of no return. A large group of Boulogne hooligans attacked supporters from Auteuil, chasing them toward their entrance into the stadium, all under the eyes of CRS riot police officers, who didn't intervene. Alerted by the situation, many Auteuil fans who were already inside the stadium left the stand to lead a counter charge, which ended in the lynching of Casual Firm member Yann Lorence. The original reports from the press claimed that Yann Lorence was peacefully leaving a bar when he was attacked by Auteuil fans. For his part, PSG president Robin Leproux said that Lorence had been caught in the middle of the brawl. Boulogne sources defended these theories, saying Lorence had distanced himself from Casual Firm a while back. Auteuil sources, on the other hand, denied these allegations and affirmed that Lorence was indeed part of the fight. Whatever the case, Lorence died of his injuries in March 2010. His death marked the end of Kop of Boulogne and Virage Auteuil as they had been known. Within the following two months, the French government dissolved several Parisian supporters' groups and the club implemented Plan Leproux, which banned the remaining fan associations from all PSG matches. Two men, Jeremy Banh and Romain Lafon, were subsequently charged with involuntary homicide. Lafon denied his involvement in the incident, whereas Banh admitted in police questioning kicking the victim before withdrawing from the fight. In November 2016, Banh was convicted of killing Lorence and received a five-year jail term, while Lafon was acquitted. Friendships with other fans =Opposing alliances= Despite their extensive history of hooliganism, Paris Saint-Germain supporters' groups have good relationships or twinnings with several fan associations from other clubs. However, due to the never-ending violent rivalry between PSG fan groups from Kop of Boulogne and Virage Auteuil, as well as the recent enmity between the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) and Karsud, twinned supporters have often choose sides in these conflicts. The relationships with Napoli, Hellas Verona and Red Star Belgrade are the perfect examples of this. Former Boulogne far- right groups are twinned with the ultras of Hellas Verona, while the CUP created a twinning with Napoli's Curva B tifosi in 2017. Both sets of Italian fans don't get along, though. So, after Napoli defeated Hellas in Verona in August 2017, the Hellas Verona ultras — alongside PSG, Lazio and Kaiserslautern hooligans — organized an assault against Napoli's Curva B supporters, their common enemy. Only the work of police forces managed to thwart the aggression. Far-right groups from Metz and hooligan firms from Toulouse (Viola Front, Gitania Tolosa, Camside) are also twinned with now- dissolved KoB associations. Karsud (left), Supras (center) and Authentiks (right). Red Star ultras Delije, for their part, are twinned with Auteuil hooligan firm Karsud as well as former Boulogne hooligan groups. Karsud's link with Delije comes from the fact that some of their leaders have Serbian origin, and they frequently display Serbian flags during PSG games. In October 2018, after the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stage match between Paris Saint-Germain and Red Star Belgrade at Parc des Princes, Delije hooligans assaulted members of the Collectif Ultras Paris near the stadium. The reason behind the attack was that Karsud has been in conflict with the CUP ever since they were expelled from the latter group in May 2017. =Celtic and Liverpool= Though rarely on the same page, Auteuil and Boulogne both respected fans from Celtic and Liverpool since they are two of the most important referents within the supporter movement. Celtic's visual approach was an inspiration for Auteuil and ultra groups in general, while Boulogne's history was strongly linked with Liverpool. Back in 1978, PSG supporters created the Kop of Boulogne stand in tribute to the famous Spion Kop stand in Anfield that groups Liverpool's ultras. Moreover, Celtic and Liverpool fanbases also share many traits, most notably the anthem \\"You'll Never Walk Alone.\\" Therefore, these were the only two exceptions in which both Auteuil and Boulogne agreed to fraternize with the same rival supporters. When PSG defeated Celtic at Parc des Princes for the second round of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in October 1995, the Scottish supporters applauded Auteuil at the end of the match to which the PSG ultras responded by chanting \\"Celtic! Celtic! Celtic!\\" during several minutes. In September 2017, the two teams met again in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stages. After the final whistle at Celtic Park, PSG fans repeated the Celtic chant, while the Scots congratulated them for the win. The return leg in Paris was no different. First, both fanbases played a match under the Eiffel Tower and then PSG supporters unfurled a giant banner at Parc des Princes with the message \\"You’ll Never Walk Alone.\\" PSG supporters in Anfield in 1997. When Liverpool played Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup semifinals at Parc des Princes in April 1997, Auteuil presented a banner that read \\"Welcome to the Legendary Fans\\" and Liverpool's hymn \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\" was respected by both stands when their English counterparts sang it during the game. PSG and Liverpool faced each other again in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League group stages in September 2018. Known for its intimidating atmosphere and noisy supporters, Anfield welcomed 2,500 Parisian ultras from the CUP who were able to make themselves heard and sometimes even more than the 50,000 supporters of the Reds. After the end of the game, the Liverpool faithful greeted their counterparts with a warm applause. =Auteuil and CUP twinnings= Historically, former Auteuil groups and Collectif Ultras Paris subgroups (grouped in the Auteuil stand as well) have been less confrontational than Boulogne supporters. As a result, they have fraternized with more fans from rival teams than their KoB counterparts. In fact, every major group in Auteuil (Supras Auteuil, Lutèce Falco and Tigris Mystic), as well as ally association Authentiks from the nearby Paris stand, had twinnings with supporters from other clubs. Supras Auteuil twinned with Köln ultra group Wilde Horde 96 in 2003. Even after the dissolution of Supras in 2010, the Germans have continued to pay them tribute. In October 2018, during a Köln home match, they unfurled a banner that read \\"25 years of ultra mentality\\" in celebration of the 25th anniversary of Supras Auteuil, founded in 1991. Likewise, Authentiks were twinned with supporters of Copenhagen, while Lutèce Falco had friendships with fans of Derry City, whom PSG met in the 2006–07 UEFA Cup first round in September 2006, and Celtic. Finally, Tigris Mystic twinned with Toulon's Irréductibles in 2001 driven by their reciprocal hatred towards Olympique de Marseille. Both groups assisted to matches together in the past, including one against Toulouse in 2005 where the Irréductibles even unfurled their own banner in Auteuil. This twinning was continued by the CUP. In February 2019, Irréductibles members attended PSG's home match against Nîmes and unfurled a banner in honor of the once-banned PSG fans, who responded with a warm applause and a chant dedicated to the glory of Toulon. Leading CUP subgroup, K-Soce Team, twinned with Brazilian club Fluminense's ultra groups Sobranada 1902 and Young Flu in 2012 and with Italian side Napoli's Curva B supporters in 2017. These groups have since attended matches from each other together, even unfurling their own banners. Relationship with players =Fan favorites= Edinson Cavani is one of PSG's biggest idols. Paris Saint-Germain supporters have seen many great players who have lastingly marked the club's history. Some of them have become fan favorites, including, among others, Jean-Pierre Dogliani in the 1970s; Mustapha Dahleb, Safet Sušić and Jean-Marc Pilorget in the 1980s; Bernard Lama, David Ginola, George Weah and Raí in the 1990s; Ronaldinho and Pauleta in the 2000s; and Zlatan Ibrahimović, Thiago Silva and Edinson Cavani in the 2010s. Historic goals have been a decisive factor in becoming an idol for the fans. Antoine Kombouaré was nicknamed \\"Gold Helmet\\" after his last-gasp header against Real Madrid (4–1) that sent PSG through to the UEFA Cup semifinals in 1993. Three years later, Bruno N'Gotty netted a long-range free kick in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final against Rapid Wien (1–0) which gave PSG their only major European title to date. Last but not least, Amara Diané saved PSG from relegation to Ligue 2 on the final match of the 2007–08 season by scoring both goals in their 2–1 win at Sochaux. A few players are revered by supporters for both their achievements on and off the field. A big PSG fan, Luis Fernández came through the youth ranks, became team captain and was part of the squad that won the club's first major trophies in the 1980s. He then returned as coach during PSG's golden era in the 1990s, leading them to the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996. Leonardo, for his part, played just one season in Paris but it was enough for the fans to remember him. He came back in 2011 as sporting director during the Qatari era, signing the next generation of fan favorites. Like Ronaldinho, other players have also remained in the memory of PSG supporters thanks to their showmanship or talent despite not staying long at the club nor winning many titles. This is the case of Marco Simone, Jay-Jay Okocha, Nenê and Mikel Arteta. Okocha and Nenê are mostly remembered for their dribbling and fantastic goals, while Simone and Arteta delighted PSG fans with their goalscoring abilities and elegant technique, respectively. Finally, Jérôme Rothen, Blaise Matuidi and Mamadou Sakho became darlings of the Parc des Princes faithful due to their strong attachment to the Parisian club. In fact, all three of them have been PSG fans since they were kids. Rothen rejected Barcelona, Juventus and Chelsea in 2004 to join dream club PSG. After his transfer to Liverpool in 2013, beloved youth academy graduate Sakho came back to bid farewell to the club and thank the supporters before a PSG home match. Matuidi is held in high regard because he offered his support for the return of the banned PSG ultras in 2016. =Heroes and villains= Signing for Marseille Several Parisian players went from fan favorites to \\"traitors\\" during the 2000s after joining Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille directly from PSG. PSG captain Frédéric Déhu and Fabrice Fiorèse were the first to experience this in 2004. Youth academy idol Lorik Cana and Modeste M'bami followed suit in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Then it was Gabriel Heinze in 2009. He signed for l'OM despite saying he never would in the past. Whenever they returned to play at Parc des Princes, PSG supporters welcomed them with insults, whistles and hostile banners, including one that read \\"Déhu, Fiorèse, Cana, M'bami, the list of whores keeps growing, Anigo open up your brothel!\\" José Anigo was Marseille's sporting director at the time. George Weah George Weah in 1992 during his PSG days. In 1995, George Weah fell out with the fans despite winning the Ballon d'Or, in part, for his European performances with PSG that year. The Liberian striker led Paris to the 1994–95 UEFA Champions League semifinals against future club A.C. Milan. Weah, however, was nonexistent against the Rossoneri as PSG lost both matches. Additionally, he told reporters after the return match that he wanted to sign for Milan next season. Parisian fans accused him of making a subpar display since he wanted to leave for the Italian club. During Weah's final game at Parc des Princes, with his transfer to Milan confirmed, Kop of Boulogne supporters insulted him and made monkey sounds every time he touched the ball. Hooligan firm Casual Firm unfurled a racist banner that read \\"Weah, we don't need you\\" written with Celtic crosses and other neo-Nazi symbols. Around the same time, white midfielder David Ginola also expressed his desire to leave the club, but did not receive the same treatment. Weah would later join Marseille, causing greater unrest with PSG fans. In 2011, during Bernard Lama's testimonial match at Parc des Princes, he told reporters that for him \\"PSG's shirt is as valuable as that of l'OM.\\" Weah added that he didn't have a good memory of the stadium and that he was there only to honor his friend Lama. In spite of this, most PSG supporters still consider him as a legendary player. Racist fans in the KoB have targeted other non-white PSG players as well. They taunted black French international goalkeeper Bernard Lama when he arrived in 1992 to replace white idol Joël Bats, whistling him and displaying swastikas during games. Lama then became a fan favorite and club legend for his performances. Vikash Dhorasoo, a France international of Indian origin, was told by a Boulogne fan to \\"go sell peanuts in the metro\\" during a game in 2006. His short stint with PSG was indeed pretty eventful. Dhorasoo scored the 2006 Coupe de France Final title-winner against Marseille before being sacked by the club following his criticism of coach Guy Lacombe. Mateja Kežman Unlike George Weah before him, and later Adrien Rabiot, Serbian striker Mateja Kežman never even won over the PSG supporters in the first place. In fact, he is one of the most unpopular figures to have ever played for the club. He was at Parc des Princes between 2008 and 2010, scoring just five times across all competitions. Often jeered by fans who were dissatisfied with his on-pitch performances, Kežman reacted in the worst possible way in February 2009. With the Parisians trailing Bordeaux 1–0 at home in the League Cup semi-finals, Kežman was substituted after yet another poor display. Booed on his way off the pitch, he took off his shirt and threw it to the floor before disappearing down the tunnel. The club suspended him for two weeks and from that moment on Kežman was booed mercilessly until his last day in Paris. Adrien Rabiot The fall out of youth product Adrien Rabiot with PSG fans in 2018 was almost identical to that of George Weah; a huge fan favorite who wanted to join an Italian club. But, really, Rabiot's fall from grace with the supporters was due to his selfish attitude throughout his PSG career, permanently complaining about his position on the field or threatening to leave for not playing enough, as well as endless contract talks every time the club made him a renewal offer. When it became clear Rabiot would not sign a new contract, the Parisian ultras unfurled a banner directed at him during an away match at Ligue 2 side Orléans. It read: \\"Rabiot, we don't need you.\\" He was subsequently frozen out by the club for the remainder of the 2018–19 season and then signed with Juventus when his contract expired in the summer of 2019. Neymar =Love turns into hate= Sought after to help Paris win the UEFA Champions League, the club paid Barcelona a world-record €222m in August 2017 for Neymar, who was welcomed with much fanfare by PSG ultras during his unveiling at Parc des Princes. The Brazilian, however, hasn't lived up to the expectations during his two seasons at the club. Although he has performed well for PSG when fit, he has also missed half of the team's games through injury, including several crucial Champions League games, leaving fans frustrated and with a taste of unfinished business. Shortly after his arrival, the Santos youth product also drew the ire of PSG supporters when he fell out with fan favorite Edinson Cavani during a Ligue 1 game against Olympique Lyonnais in September 2017. First, Dani Alves took the ball out of Cavani's hands and gave it to Neymar to take a free-kick. Later in the game, PSG were given a penalty and a brief argument ensued between them over who should take it. Cavani prevailed but his shot was saved by Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes. Neymar during his PSG unveiling in 2017. The São Paulo native then damaged their relationship further when PSG faced Dijon in January 2018. Leading 7–0, the Parisians were awarded a spot-kick as the Parc des Princes faithful made clear they wanted Cavani to take it and become PSG's all-time top-scorer. Neymar went against their wishes, though, and slotted home the penalty amongst whistles and chants of \\"Cavani, Cavani.\\" Despite explaining he was just following the manager's orders, fans still believed it was a selfish move from his part. But his desire for a Barcelona return in 2019 was the final straw for PSG ultra group Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP). Feeling he had \\"humiliated\\" their club, the ultras handed out flyers which described Neymar as \\"the most disgusting player in PSG history\\" and chanted \\"Neymar, son of a bitch\\" during the first home match of the 2019–20 season in August 2019. They also held two insulting banners, one urging him to \\"get lost\\" and another mocking his alleged rape case. =Road to redemption= When the transfer fell threw, his comeback game against Strasbourg at Parc des Princes in September 2019 was even worse. Once again, PSG ultras greeted Neymar with chants that he is a \\"son of a bitch\\", accompanied by boos every time he touched the ball and two more banners. One read \\"€20m to join Messi, no more whores in Paris,\\" in reference to Neymar's attempt to put €20m from his own pocket in order to join Lionel Messi and Barcelona; the other prompted Neymar Senior to sell his son in Vila Mimosa, a notorious prostitution area of Rio de Janeiro. Neymar responded by scoring a stunning last-minute bicycle kick to beat Strasbourg 1–0, but PSG ultras still jeered him. The CUP continued to whistle him most of 2019 despite several winning goals as well as great performances and an overall conciliatory attitude. In December, however, PSG's home win against Galatasaray marked a turning point after Neymar finally made peace with Cavani. With PSG leading 4–0, the referee signalled to the penalty spot. The Paulista took the ball and personally handed it to the Uruguayan, who was in need of a confidence boost after his recent fitness struggles and goalscoring drought. Cavani scored and Neymar embraced him. PSG's next home match against Amiens later that month was the first time since his summer transfer saga that Neymar wasn't whistled by the CUP. In late February 2020, PSG lost 2–1 away to Borussia Dortmund in the first leg of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League last-16, a result that left them on the brink of elimination for the fourth consecutive year at the same stage. During PSG's next home match against Bordeaux, the CUP complained about the team's poor performance by unveiling a scathing banner directed at club captain Thiago Silva and the world's two most expensive players, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. It read as follows: \\"Kombouaré, Gino, Raí, they had a winning mentality. Silva, Mbappé, Neymar – scared of winning? Grow some balls.\\" Neymar and company would then step up in the return match. The South American star scored the first goal and led PSG to the Champions League quarterfinals 3–2 on aggregate with a 2–0 victory over Dortmund at an empty Parc des Princes. Despite not being allowed into the stadium, around 3,000 ultras gathered outside it to cheer the team in the midst of a ban of gatherings of more than 1,000 people as French authorities tried to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the final whistle, PSG players appeared on the balcony to thank their supporters with Neymar, Mbappé and Ángel Di María leading the celebrations. In August 2020, after Neymar guided PSG to the Champions League final for the first time ever, CUP leader Romain Mabille announced that they were planning to show him their appreciation for his displays and attitude throughout the season. Kylian Mbappé Even though Kylian Mbappé is a favorite for regular PSG fans, his relationship with the club's ultras is rather cold. The Frenchman is one of the best players in the world, but he isn't revered like Edinson Cavani despite excelling just as well on the pitch. Tension between Mbappé and the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) has been around since he arrived from Monaco in 2017. The ultras have always felt that Mbappé, although born and raised in Paris, isn't truly passionate about PSG and sees the club as a stepping stone before playing for Real Madrid, his real dream. He didn't come through the Paris Saint-Germain Youth Academy and it's well known that Mbappé grew up idolising Real Madrid stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane. The CUP also have a problem with Mbappé's perceived arrogance. He did turn down Real Madrid to sign for PSG, but only to cement 'his legacy' in French football by bringing a UEFA Champions League title to the Parc des Princes. During the 2018–19 season, his second in the French capital, he twice argued with coach Thomas Tuchel after being substituted off, which for the supporters came across as disrespectful to his teammates on the bench. Kylian Mbappé celebrating a goal with France in 2018. Then, following his acceptance speech upon being awarded both Ligue 1 Player and Young Player of the Season, Mbappé seemed to hint that he could leave the club, saying \\"maybe it's the time to take on more responsibilities, maybe at PSG, of course, or maybe elsewhere.\\" This obviously didn't sit down well with the ultras, who had questioned his lack of long-term commitment from the start and now believed it could all be a salary increase strategy. Mbappé later claimed he was misinterpreted and had \\"no desire to leave.\\" He apologised to the fans, who he said \\"did not understand the message,\\" adding that it was in the best interests of PSG and that \\"only the coach, the president and I knew what I was talking about.\\" That same campaign, after the shocking loss to Manchester United in the Champions League, approximately 500 ultras attended a training session where they proceeded to insult the players and Mbappé in particular, who had missed a clear chance during the match. The following season, the CUP held up a banner calling out Mbappé, Thiago Silva and Neymar for failing to 'man up' during PSG's loss away to Borussia Dortmund. Mbappé first hit back on social media alluding to his FIFA World Cup victory with an ironic post that read, “Scared of winning?” He then walked off the pitch without thanking the ultras with his teammates after producing a man-of-the-match performance in the club's next league match against Dijon. Edinson Cavani Idolised by the ultras for his commitment, passion and a genuine love for the shirt, PSG's all-time top scorer Edinson Cavani disappointed many of his admirers due to the way he left the club in June 2020. PSG offered “El Matador” the chance to extend his deal for two months so he could finish the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, which had been rescheduled for August because of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, annoyed at how the club had treated him, the Uruguayan striker declined the offer and became a free agent. Throughout the season, PSG coach Thomas Tuchel put him aside by giving new signing Mauro Icardi more room, while sporting director Leonardo handled his departure in a clumsy and rushed way. Nonetheless, the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP) still wanted to pay tribute to Cavani for his seven years at the French capital and his 200 goals scored. Except that since the end of his contract, the South American walled in incomprehensible silence for PSG and his former fans. Although he would later thank them, apologising for his quietness in the process, the situation had already divided the CUP between those who thought Cavani deserved an homage and those who didn't. Romain Mabille, head of the PSG ultras, was amongst the latter and resigned his post after a CUP subgroup unilaterally decided to make a banner in Cavani's honour. Even if this episode hurt his legacy, Cavani remains a PSG legend for most fans. Thomas Meunier Thomas Meunier was an immediate fan favourite at the Parc des Princes after his good debut 2016–17 season. Supporters were fond of his hard-working approach on the pitch, as well as his straight-forward and down to earth personality off it. Meunier was even touted as a potential future team captain until he liked a tweet praising the atmosphere created by the fans of PSG arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille at the Stade Vélodrome ahead of their 2017–18 UEFA Europa League quarterfinal second leg win over RB Leipzig in April 2018. The like enraged the Parisian fanbase, who were already sensitive by the perceived disrespectful behaviour shown by other players, most notably Neymar, towards the club and its pre- Qatari ownership history. Meunier made things worse by responding to angry PSG fans on Twitter, calling them \\"pseudo-supporters\\" and that they needed to \\"know their place\\" as fans. The Belgian right back then said that he was answerable only to the ultras because of their unwavering support. But when he refused to apologise, as demanded by the Collectif Ultras Paris (CUP), his reputation amongst the supporters never recovered and he eventually left the club under controversial circumstances in June 2020. Meunier claimed that he wanted to stay at PSG and criticised sporting director Leonardo for not renewing his contract; it was later revealed that Leonardo didn't offer him a contract extension because he had already signed with Borussia Dortmund. Anthems and mottos \\"Allez Paris!,\\" recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971, was the club's first official anthem. A PSG fan from the start, she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the club's foundation in 1970. At the time, an appeal was made for anonymous people to buy subscription forms in kiosks. A year later, Cordy was named PSG's official godmother and she celebrated it by recording the aforementioned hymn. The club's second anthem, \\"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!\\" by Les Parisiens, was recorded in 1977, replacing Cordy's version. An initiative of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar, he produced and released it under his homonym record label. The song's chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games. A new version, also called \\"Allez Paris-Saint-Germain!,\\" was recorded in 2010 as part of the club's 40th anniversary celebrations. Sung to the tune of \\"Go West\\" by Village People, the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans. This is the club's current official anthem. The song debuted in the 2010 edition of the Tournoi de Paris. PSG players and coach Carlo Ancelotti re-recorded it with their voices in 2012 at the request of the club's incoming Qatari owners. \\"Ô Ville Lumière\\" (\\"Oh City of Light\\"), to the tune of \\"Flower of Scotland,\\" is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters. This chant was created by dissolved Kop of Boulogne ultra group Boulogne Boys. PSG gave it official status in 2015 when the club announced it would accompany the players' entry into the field, a tradition which began in 1992 with the song \\"Who Said I Would\\" by Phill Collins. Supporters' groups from the Boulogne and Auteuil stands have other chants as well, most notably \\"Le Parc est à nous\\" (\\"The Parc is ours\\"), \\"Paris est magique!\\" (\\"Paris is magical!\\") and \\"Ici, c'est Paris!\\" (\\"This is Paris!\\"). Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s. \\"Paris est magique!\\" and \\"Ici, c'est Paris!\\" are also the club's most iconic mottos or slogans. The latter was created by dissolved Virage Auteuil ultra group Supras Auteuil, which patented it as a brand in 2008. A few years later, PSG began making use of the \\"Ici, c'est Paris!\\" slogan in its marketing (banners on the stands, TV adverts, merchandise) and Supras turned down the club's offer of €2,000 for the property rights in February 2016. A legal battle ensued between PSG and the group. They finally reached an agreement in August 2019. The club will be able to continue marketing the slogan with supporters still allowed to make free use of it. Famous fans Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is one of the club's most famous fans. He regularly attends home matches at Parc des Princes and was a key figure behind the buyout of PSG by Qatar Sports Investments (QSI) in June 2011. Other notable PSG fans include former NBA star Tony Parker; American actor Patrick Dempsey; tennis player Victoria Azarenka; judoka Teddy Riner; and record producer DJ Snake, among many others listed below. * Agathe Auproux * Richard Anconina * Giannis Antetokounmpo * Victoria Azarenka * Jean-Paul Belmondo * Malik Bentalha * François Berléand * Louis Bertignac * Booba * Patrick Bruel * Nicolas Batum * Jimmy Butler * Annie Cordy * Michel Cymes * Gérard Darmon * Jamel Debbouze * Laurent Delahousse * Cécile de Ménibus * Patrick Dempsey * Sacha Distel * DJ Snake * Nicolas Duvauchelle * Jimmy Garoppolo * Pierre Gasly * Richard Gasquet * Rudy Gobert * Francis Huster * JoeyStarr * Michaël Llodra * La Fouine * Philippe Lucas * Enrico Macias * Boban Marjanović * Mireille Mathieu * Gaël Monfils * Nagui * Joakim Noah * Yannick Noah * Sabrina Ouazani * Tony Parker * Teddy Riner * Nicolas Sarkozy * Michaël Youn Nicolas Sarkozy References External links ;Official websites *PSG.FR - Site officiel du Paris Saint-Germain *Paris Saint-Germain - Ligue 1 *Paris Saint-Germain - UEFA.com Category:Paris Saint- Germain F.C.

It was quickly defeated by Yuan's armies and led to the continued consolidation of Yuan's powers as President of the Republic of China. The Bai Lang Rebellion was concurrent to the Second Revolution.  Background  Kuomintang leader Song Jiaoren was assassinated in March 1913. Some people believe that Yuan Shikai was responsible, and although it has never been proven, he had already arranged the assassination of several pro-revolutionist generals. Animosity towards Yuan grew. In April he secured a Reorganization Loan of 25 million pounds sterling from Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Japan, without consulting the parliament first. The loan was used to finance Yuan's Beiyang Army.Hirata Koji, \\"Britain's Men on the Spot in China: John Jordan, Yuan Shikai, and the Reorganization Loan, 1912–1914.\\" Modern Asian Studies 47.3 (2013): 895-934. On May 20, 1913, Yuan concluded a deal with Russia that granted Russia special privileges in Outer Mongolia and restricted Chinese right to station troops there.Jianyong, Feng. \\"The 1911 Revolution and the Frontier: The 'Political Game' and 'State-Building' in Outer Mongolia during the 1911 Revolution 辛亥革命とフロンティア 外モンゴルにおける政治のゲームと国家建設.\\" (2014). online Kuomintang members of the Parliament accused Yuan of abusing his rights and called for his removal. On the other hand, the Progressive Party (), which was composed of constitutional monarchists and supported Yuan, accused the Kuomintang of fomenting an insurrection. Yuan then decided to use military action against the Kuomintang. There were several underlying reasons for the Second Revolution besides Yuan's abuse of power. First was that most Revolutionary Armies from different provinces were disbanded after the establishment of the Republic of China, and many officers and soldiers felt that they were not compensated for toppling the Qing Dynasty. These factors gave rise to much discontent against the new government among the military. Secondly, many revolutionaries felt that Yuan Shikai and Li Yuanhong were undeserving of the posts of presidency and vice presidency, because they acquired the posts through political maneuvering rather than participation in the revolutionary movement. Lastly, Yuan's use of violence (such as Song's assassination) dashed the Kuomintang's hope of achieving reforms and political goals through electoral means.  Events  = Yuan Shikai's actions against KMT supporters = In the beginning of May Li Chun led the 8th Division from Baoding to Wuhan, and also brought his crack troops to reinforce Shanghai. On June 9, President Yuan removed KMT supporter Li Liejun as Governor of Jiangxi, he was replaced by Vice President Li Yuanhong.. Some modern scholars have rehabilitated Li Liejun in this light.李列钧在江西一带实行政治和经济改革，整顿财政、选派留学生出国、并捉捕了彭木香等匪徒。見： June 13, Military Governor of Guangdong Hu Hanmin (Kuomintang) was appointed to a position in Tibet, he was replaced by Chen Jiongming. June 30, Anhui Governor Bai Wenwei (KMT) was also dismissed, on the same day Li Yuanhong made mass arrests of underground party leaders in Wuhan. At the behest of Jiujiang garrison commander Chen Tingxun, on July 3, Yuan sent the Beiyang Army 6th Division under command of Li Chun into Jiangxi. =Southern Provinces declare independence= alt= On July 15, Huang Xing arrived at Nanjing, organized an anti-Yuan force, and announced Jiangsu independence. Jiangsu Governor Cheng Dequan was named commander of southern forces, however Cheng declined the offer and fled to Shanghai. On July 17, Anhui governor Bai Wenwei, declared his province's independence. On the 18, Chen Qimei announced Shanghai independence. On July 18, Chen Jiongming responded to Sun's plea to declare Guangdong's independence.北伐秘史，上冊第11頁，劉秉榮著，知識出版社，1995年第1版，. On July 19, Sun Daoren and Xu Zhongzhi announced Fujian independence over telegram. On July 20, Zhejiang Governor Zhu Rui declared neutrality in the conflict. On July 21, Li Liejun, who had been dismissed as Jiangxi governor by Yuan's government, returned to Jiangxi from Shanghai under Sun Yat Sen's orders. At Hukou County he reunited with his former subordinates and declared Jiangxi's independence to the Yuan government via telegram. On July 22, anti-Yuan forces were defeated around Xuzhou by the Beiyang Army 2nd Division led by Feng Guozhang and Zhang Xun and retreated to Nanjing. From the 22nd to 28th anti-Qing forces attempted to capture \\"江南制造局\\" but the Beiyang Army was able to resist the attack with assistance from the Beiyang Navy.《剑桥中华民国史》第四章（二次革命） On July 25, Tan Yankai declared independence in Hunan. On July 28, seeing the situation as hopeless, Huang Xing leaves Nanjing and returns to Hunan. On August 4 in Chongqing Xiong Kewu declared Sichuan independence. Yuan Shikai ordered Long Jiguang and his army into Sichuan to suppress the rebellion. Long Jiguang would be successful in this and defeated Xiong Kewu's forces. On the 8th He Haiming declared independence in Nanjing a second time, however that evening Chen Juhe went to Nanjing's 8th Division headquarters and cancelled the declaration. The next day Sun Daoren cancelled Fujian independence via telegram message. On August 11, He Haiming again declared independence in Nanjing, and led 2000 soldiers in a bloody battle against the Beiyang Army. August 13, the pro-Yuan Ji Army led by Long Jiguang took control of Guangzhou. On the same day in Hunan, Tan Yankai took to telegram to cancel independence, also the Beiyang Navy took Wusong, and later anti-Yuan forces in Jiading were dispersed. On August 18, the Beiyang Army under command of Li Chun captured Nanchang. on August 28, Ni Sichong led forces to capture Anqing from the rebels. On September 1 Zhang Xun's Wuwei Corps captured Nanjing. At this point every province had repealed independence, so Sun Yat Sen, Huang Xing, Chen Qimei all fled to Japan. On September 11, Xiong Kewu abandoned Chongqing, dispersed his forces, assumed an alias and fled. The next day, Long Jiguang and his Ji Army entered Chongqing and the Second Revolution was defeated in its entirety. After the failure of the Second Revolution, Sun Yat Sen again fled the country and re-established the secret society Revive China Society. In October 1913 an intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extended recognition to his government. Duan Qirui and other trusted Beiyang generals were given prominent positions in the cabinet. To achieve international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet. China was still to be suzerain, but it would have to allow Russia a free hand in Outer Mongolia and Tanna Tuva and Britain continuation of its influence in Tibet. Seeing the situation for his party worsen, Sun Yat-sen fled to Japan in November 1913. Subsequently, Yuan gradually took over the government, using the military as the base of his power. He dissolved the national and provincial assemblies, and the House of Representatives and Senate were replaced by the newly formed \\"Council of State\\", with Duan Qirui, his trusted Beiyang lieutenant, as Prime Minister. He relied on the American-educated Tsai Tingkan for English translation and connections with western powers. Finally, Yuan had himself elected president to a five-year term, publicly labelled the KMT a seditious organization, ordered the KMT's dissolution, and evicted all its members from Parliament. Aftermath The KMT's \\"Second Revolution\\" ended in failure as Yuan's troops achieved complete victory over revolutionary uprisings. Provincial governors with KMT loyalties who remained willingly submitted to Yuan. Because those commanders not loyal to Yuan were effectively removed from power, the Second Revolution cemented Yuan's power.Bonavia 36 In January 1914, China's Parliament was formally dissolved. To give his government a semblance of legitimacy, Yuan convened a body of 66 men from his cabinet who, on 1 May 1914, produced a \\"constitutional compact\\" that effectively replaced China's provisional constitution. The new legal status quo gave Yuan, as president, practically unlimited powers over China's military, finances, foreign policy, and the rights of China's citizens. Yuan justified these reforms by stating that representative democracy had been proven inefficient by political infighting.Spence, Jonathan D. (1999) The Search for Modern China, W.W. Norton and Company. p. 279. . After his victory, Yuan reorganized the provincial governments. Each province was supported by a military governor (都督) as well as a civil authority, giving each governor control of their own army. This helped lay the foundations for the warlordism that crippled China over the next two decades. During Yuan's presidency, a silver \\"dollar\\" (yuan in Chinese) carrying his portrait was introduced.

He joined the PBR in 2015 and was named Rookie of the Year in 2016. On November 5, 2017, he became the youngest PBR World Champion. He won his second PBR world championship on November 10, 2019. He also became the youngest bull rider to win two world championships.  Early life  Jess Lockwood was born on September 28, 1997, in Volborg, Montana, to Ed and Angie Lockwood (née Schillinger). His father was a former Big Sky region champion bull rider and a professional saddle bronc rider. His mother was a long-time barrel racer. Lockwood was raised on his family's 12,000 acre ranch where they run about 400 head of cattle. As a small child, he would crawl on his father’s back and be bucked around their living room for eight seconds. He would then ask his mother “How many was I?”. His father would then interview him using the TV remote as a microphone. Lockwood said his father taught him to ride first on sheep and calves, then steers and bulls. Lockwood started riding bulls when he was in the 8th grade. He was the Northern Rodeo Association year-end champion in 2014 and 2015, earning $60,000 in his junior year of high school. He completed his senior year of high school on-line in order to pursue bull riding full time.  Career  Lockwood joined the PBR on his 18th birthday, September 28, 2015. = Season 2017 = He was named the PBR 2016 Rookie of the Year. Early in the 2017 season, he missed five events due to a groin injury when he was stepped on by 2015 PBR world champion bull Long John. On September 9, 2017, while attempting to ride Sweet Pro's Bruiser, Lockwood was knocked unconscious. On September 23, 2017, he was stepped on by Blue Magic after being thrown. Lockwood suffered a punctured lung, four broken ribs, and a lacerated kidney. After missing several events due to these injuries, Lockwood still finished 2017 a winner. In Las Vegas, Nevada, at the T-Mobile Arena, on November 5, 2017, he became the youngest bull rider in history to win the PBR World Champion title and was awarded the $1 million prize that goes with it. = Season 2018 = In the 2018 season, Lockwood's bid to win back-to-back World Champion titles was cut short when a groin injury left him unable to compete in the final six regular-season premier series events. On September 7, 2018, Lockwood limped from the arena after riding Power Puff for 70 points. He declined the re-ride and was unable to compete in the remainder of the event due to the groin injury. Lockwood did not compete again until the PBR World Finals on November 7, 2018. = Season 2019 = On February 9, 2019, while attempting to ride Wild Goose, Lockwood was struck in the shoulder by one of Wild Goose's horns. This resulted in a broken collar bone that took Lockwood out of competition for nine Unleash the Beast events. At the time of the injury, he was ranked number one in the world with a lead of 967.5 points. On October 4, 2019, at the Minneapolis Invitational, Lockwood set a new PBR record for the most 15/15 Bucking Battle wins in a single season. He rode Bad Beagle for a score of 91.5 for his fourth 15/15 Bucking Battle win of the season. On October 13, 2019, in Greensboro, North Carolina, he selected Heartbreak Kid for the championship round of the Wrangler Long Live Cowboys Classic. Heartbreak Kid was on the second longest buck-off streak in PBR history. He had 38 constitutive buck-offs at PBR premier series events. Lockwood broke the buck off streak when he made eight seconds scoring a new career high 93.75 points. When Lockwood released the rope at the end of the ride, he crashed into the arena floor head first. There was no celebration by Lockwood as he immediately exited the area in pain after the potential neck breaking landing. He was diagnosed with a cervical sprain. The following weekend, Lockwood rode Heartbreak Kid again at the Cooper Tires Take the Money and Ride in Nampa, Idaho, for a new career-high 94 points. On November 8, 2019, during a ceremony at the PBR World Finals, Lockwood received the Mason Lowe Award for his 94 point ride on Heartbreak Kid. Two days later, he won the PBR World Finals event average and his second world championship. = Season 2020 = On February 1, 2020, Lockwood became the fastest PBR rider to cross the $4 million dollar mark in earnings. Lockwood earned the $4 million dollars in his first 39 months of competing in the PBR. On March 1, 2020, during the championship round of the Caterpillar Classic in Kansas City, Missouri, Lockwood hung his spur in the bull rope while getting off I'm Legit Too after completing a 91.5-point ride aboard the bull. Lockwood's left hamstring was torn from his hip bone requiring surgery and a six-month recovery. At the time of his injury he led the PBR with 9 round wins and had five 90 point rides in the 2020 season. Lockwood was World Number 2 in the standings before the injury. Lockwood’s annual rankings in his career to date are as follows: *2016 - World Number Eight with $177,178.68 in earnings. *2017 - World Number One with $1,525,292.90 in earnings.

It may have originated in Europe but now has a cosmopolitan distribution and can be a pest of crops. Description Superficially the garden symphylan resembles a centipede. It is white and up to long. It has a head with three pairs of mouthparts, a pair of long antennae and no eyes. The body is segmented, the front twelve segments each bearing a pair of short legs, while the two remaining segments are limbless. The body is covered by up to 22 dorsal, slightly sclerotinised tergites. The legs work in unison, the two sides alternating. Distribution and habitat The garden symphylan occurs in most parts of the world, having been transported inadvertently with plants: it probably originated in Europe. It lives in humus-rich soil, under stones, in leaf litter, in rotting wood, in decaying matter and in other moist places. It does not burrow but takes advantage of existing cracks. It needs high humidity levels to survive; if the relative humidity in the soil is below 75%, about 95% mortality occurs within three hours, but placing a lettuce leaf on the soil surface reduces the mortality rate considerably. Ecology Symphylans are rapid runners and the extra tergites give the body great flexibility, so they can twist, turn and loop, manoeuvring between soil particles rapidly in order to escape predators. They primarily feed on plant roots and detritus. The sexes are separate in the garden symphylan. The male deposits small stalked spermatophores which the female picks up, storing the sperm in receptacles in her mouth. She produces eggs singly through a gonopore on the fourth segment, and transfers them by mouth to a frond of moss or similar location, where each is fixed and smeared with sperm. Development is direct; the newly hatched juvenile has six pairs of legs, and these increase in number as the animal grows extra segments. Moulting takes place throughout the animal's life, and it may survive for up to four years. Large populations of garden symphylan can cause damage to crops by feeding on the root hairs, roots and tubers, the plants showing loss of vigour and reduced growth. Susceptible crops include potatoes, beetroot and maize.

It would protect the waters and surrounding lands of the Moisie River. The Moisie is one of the largest rivers in the region, flows through dramatic unspoiled scenery and is an important Atlantic salmon river. Although the plan to create the reserve was announced in 2003, as of 2018 the local Innu communities had yet to give their consent. Background The plan for the Moisie river aquatic reserve was officially announced by the Government of Quebec in February 2003. It would be the first aquatic reserve in Quebec, and the Moisie would become the first watercourse to the fully protected against any form of industrial exploitation. Measured by watershed, the Moisie would be the second largest protected river in southern Canada, after the Fraser River. The reserve includes the Aux Pékans and Carheil rivers, tributaries of the Moisie that Hydro-Québec had been studying with a view to diverting them to the Sainte-Marguerite River basin to increase the energy that could be stored for the SM-3 plant. However, a commission of the Bureau of Public Hearings on the environment concluded that this was not economically justified, and could adversely affect the salmon population. In the end the government decided in favor of protecting the two tributaries. In April 2018 it was reported that the negotiations between the Uashat-Maliotenam Council, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Forests, Wildlife and Parks on creating the aquatic reserve did not have the full support of the community. One of the councilors said the chief had not consulted enough with the community, and several people asked for a referendum if an agreement in principle was signed. The Matimekosh–Lac- John Innu should also be involved, since their ancestors had used the river in the past. Objectives The goals are to conserve a representative river in the Manicouagan Reservoir Basin and Sainte-Marguerite River Plateau natural region, to protect the Atlantic salmon population, to protect biodiversity in the aquatic and riverbank ecosystems, to develop key elements in the landscape, to preserve the landscape visible from the bottom of the Moisie river valley and to acquire new knowledge on salmon ecology and on the natural heritage of the Moisie river. Under the Natural Heritage Conservation Act, prohibited activities would include mining, and gas or petroleum development; exploration of underground resources that involves stripping, trenching, excavation or deforestation; forestry; industrial generation of hydroelectricity or other types of power; new vacation resorts; and earthwork, back-filling or construction work. Also, no activity would be allowed that would be likely to damage the bed, banks or shore of any water body or stream in the reserve. Location The proposed Moisie river aquatic reserve is in the Côte-Nord region between 50°19' and 52°29' north and 65°58' and 67°33' west. The upstream portion is in the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality and the downstream portion is in the Sept-Rivières Regional County Municipality. The river runs from north to south through the unorganized territories of Rivière-Mouchalagane, Rivière-Nipissis and Lac-Walker, and through the town of Moisie. The river mouth is on the north shore of the Estuary of Saint Lawrence about east of the town of Sept-Îles, Quebec. The proposed reserve would cover , following the main bed of the Moisie River from to from its mouth through a corridor wide, including of the Aux Pékans River. Terrain The proposed aquatic reserve is in the Grenville Province of the Canadian Shield, in the foothills of a mountain range formed almost 1,000 million years ago, with high and low hills, mounds and hummocks. The bedrock is mostly gneiss and paragneiss, with some marble upstream, and small pockets of anorthosite and charnockite downstream. The surface is covered by a thin layer of glacial till upstream. Further down the surface is mostly covered in rock and peat. The bed of the Moisie river is composed of glaciofluvial sand and gravel. The highest elevation in the proposed reserve is , falling to near the coast. The average elevation is . The Moisie river rises in Ménistouc lake at an elevation of and flows south for to the Saint Lawrence Estuary. Its drainage basin covers . It has nine tributaries that drain more than . The largest are the Aux Pékans River in the north, draining , and Nipissis River in the south, draining . The river drops on average , with sections of rapids and waterfalls, and discharges on average of exceptionally clean water. Along most of its length it runs through deep gorges. The river flows through dramatic, unspoiled scenery and has not been dammed for hydroelectricity. It has great value as one of the last remaining examples of untamed rivers on the North Shore. Environment shore of the river The area of the proposed reserve is in the Central Laurentian natural province, in the Manicouagan Reservoir Basin and the Sainte-Marguerite River Plateau natural regions. The climate is subarctic, subhumid in the north and south, and humid in the center. It is cold, with a short growing season in the north, and has a less severe climate with a longer growing period further south. A map of the Ecological regions of Quebec shows the Aux Pékans River rising to the northwest of Fermont just west of the Spruce/lichen domain of the boreal zone. The Moisie itself rises and flows for most of its length through the eastern spruce/moss domain of the boreal zone. In the north, heath covers the steeper valley slopes. About a third of the proposed reserve is covered by forest. This mainly consists of stands of mature softwood. The most common species is black spruce (Picea mariana), often growing with balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Sandy terraces may hold jack pine (Pinus banksiana). There are a few mixed stands, in which the most common hardwood is paper birch (Betula papyrifera). Near its mouth, south of the reserve, the river enters the eastern fir/white birch domain of the boreal zone. Salmon Katchapahun Fish Ladder on the Moisie The Moisie river is known as an Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) river, with catches averaging in weight. Many of the fish spawning on the river have spent several seasons at sea. Some return to spawn for several years in a row. Salmon fishing is allowed on the lower of the Moisie River, and on the south part of the Nipisso River. About 1,000 to 1,500 fish are caught each year, generating local economic benefits of about CDN$2 million. The population of Atlantic salmon is declining rapidly, both here and elsewhere. Human presence Two electrical power lines cross the south of the proposed reserve. Almost all the proposed reserve is within the Saguenay beaver reserve, where the Innu people of the Innu Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam first nation have the right to hunt and trap fur bearing animals.

Geography  Panorama from the summit with Montgènevre and, on the right, the Chaberton Amministratively the mountain belongs to the French department of Hautes-Alpes close to the French- Italian border. On its summit the Susa Valley (tributay of the river Po) meets the valleys of the Durance (tributary of the Rhone) and of the Cerveyrette, the latter tributary of the Durance. The Main chain of the Alps connects northwards the Chenaillet to the Col de Montgenèvre, while towards NE it goes with the Monte Gimont. From the Chenaillet branches out from the main ridge a secondary chain dividing the valley of the Durance from the Cerveyrette one, which continues with the Sommet des Anges and the Sommet Château Jouan. Both the Durance and the Piccola Dora (an upper branch of Dora Riparia) have their sources on the slopes of the Chenaillet.  Geology  Pillow lava on the slopes of Chenaillet. The Chenaillet is a geological curiosity, being an ancient submarine volcano as old as 155 million years, which was uplifted to its present location during the Alpine orogeny. On the slopes of the Chenaillet are well distinguishable pillow lavas and ophiolite rocks. These features are explained on a geological foothpath reaching the summit of the mountain by some didactic panels both in French and in Italian.  History  The mountain up to the end of the II World War was on the Franco-Italian border. Due to its prominent position overlooking the Col de Montgenèvre, from Louis XIV times till to the ligne Maginot, the area vas heavily fortified. On 23-6-1940 an Italian offensive conquered the mountain and also in 1944 it was the theater of heavy fights between German-Italian and French-Moroccan troops; and after many decades it is still possible to find howitzer chippings on the ground. After the end of the war, following the Paris Peace Treaties signed on February 1947, the border was modified and Mount Chenaillet is now totally in France..  Access to the summit  The summit of the Chenaillet can be reached by foothpath from several starting points. The way from the Col de Montgenèvre is considered quite an easy hike..

He held earlier command roles against the Umayyads at the battle of al-Harra and the siege of Mecca in 683. He fought alongside Ibn al-Zubayr in a second siege of Mecca in 692, where he was slain by Umayyad forces. Origins and family Abd Allah ibn Muti was born during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad (d. 632). He was the son of Muti ibn al-Aswad; they belonged to the Banu Adi clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca. His mother was Umm Hisham bint Abi'l Khiyar Abd Yall ibn Abd Manaf. Ibn Muti resided in Medina, the political center of the Caliphate. He owned shared residential property in the city with the early companion of Muhammad and poet Zayd ibn Thabit. The two entered a legal dispute over the property which was arbitrated by Marwan ibn al-Hakam, the governor of the city in 661–668. Ibn Muti also owned property and a well called the Well of Ibn Muti after him located between al-Abwa and al-Suqya. Ibn Muti had seven sons and four daughters from different wives and slave women: from his wife Rayta bint Abd Allah he had his sons Ishaq and Ya'qub; with his wife Umm Abd al-Malik bint Abd Allah ibn Khalid he had his sons Muhammad and Imran; from his wife Umm Hakim bint Abd Allah he had a daughter, Fatima, and from his fourth wife Bint Kharash ibn Umayya he had two daughters, Umm Salama and Umm Hisham. From his two slave women he had his sons Ibrahim, Isma'il and Zakariyya and a daughter, Burayha. His grandson Abd al-Aziz ibn Ibrahim participated in the rebellion of Muhammad al-Nafs al-Zakiyya in 762/63 and was arrested, given lashes and released by the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur. Military career In 664 or 665, he was dispatched by Caliph Mu'awiya I at the head of 4,000 Medinese soldiers to reinforce the Arab garrison in Alexandria after the garrison commander of the city complained his troops were numerically insufficient to control its oft- rebellious Greek Christian inhabitants. He is later mentioned in the historical record in 680. At that time, he issued a warning to Husayn ibn Ali, the surviving grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and son of Caliph Ali (), not to leave Mecca for Kufa where sympathizers of his father called for him to claim the caliphate from the ruling Umayyad dynasty. He advised him to take up safe haven in the Ka'aba of Mecca where he would rally supporters from the Quraysh against Caliph Yazid (). After a short stay in Mecca, Husayn ultimately headed for Kufa and once again encountered Ibn Muti at a watering place along the desert route, where Ibn Muti pleaded that he not confront the Umayyads. Husayn was slain by Umayyad forces at the Battle of Karbala on the outskirts of Kufa. Ibn Muti had attempted to depart Medina as well, but was persuaded by his distant relative Abd Allah ibn Umar to remain in the city and not rebel against the caliph. When Yazid sent his envoy Nu'man ibn Bashir al- Ansari to warn the inhabitants of Medina in 682 not to rebel against the caliph's rule, Ibn Muti derided him. The people of Medina rose in revolt and Yazid dispatched his Syrian troops led by Muslim ibn Uqba to subdue the city. The Medinese were organized along factional lines and Ibn Muti was made commander of the Quraysh contingent. After the Syrians bested the Medinese, Ibn Muti and many of his Qurayshite fighters fled for Mecca where they received safe haven with the Qurayshite leader Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr. He later became one of the main commanders of Mecca's defense during the abortive Umayyad siege of the city. Governorship of Kufa After Yazid's death, Ibn al-Zubayr gained recognition as caliph in most of the provinces of the Caliphate except parts of Syria. He appointed Ibn Muti governor of Kufa and its dependencies in April 685, replacing Abd Allah ibn Yazid al-Khath'ami. Upon hearing from his advisers news of Ibn Muti's appointment, the Syria-based Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik called him \\"a brave man who has fallen many a time, and a valiant one, how he hates fleeing\\". Ibn Muti appointed Iyas ibn Mudarib al-Ijli as the head of his shurṭa with orders to severely punish seditious activities in the city. After Iyas raised suspicions of rebellion by the pro-Alid noble al-Mukhtar al-Thaqafi (who fought alongside Ibn Muti against the Umayyads in Mecca), Ibn Muti attempted to summon the latter. Al- Mukhtar delayed his appearance before the governor and secretly organized a coup against him by his Kufan partisans. The Kufan Arab nobility largely supported Ibn Muti, but Mukhtar's forces became empowered with the recruitment of the Kufan grandee Ibrahim ibn al-Ashtar. Ibn al-Ashtar was instrumental in the fighting which ultimately forced Ibn Muti to withdraw from the city. Most of the fighting took place in the streets and alleys of Kufa, with the pro- Alid opponents of the governor led by al-Sa'ib ibn Malik al-Ash'ari and Ibn al-Ashtar ultimately besting Ibn Muti's men and forcing him and a small coterie of supporters to barricade in the city's fortified palace. He was persuaded by his loyalist, the Arab noble Shabath ibn Rib'i al-Tamimi, to secretly escape the city alone after refusing an earlier suggestion to formally surrender, which he deemed a betrayal of Ibn al-Zubayr. Ibn Muti praised the Arab nobles on his side and dismissed Mukhtar's supporters as lowly men before evacuating. His supporters then obtained safe conduct in return for giving al-Mukhtar their allegiance. In a different account of events, Ibn Muti departs Kufa after being granted 100,000 silver dirhams and safe conduct by al-Mukhtar. Later service and death After leaving Kufa, Ibn Muti established himself in Basra where the Zubayrids remained in control. Ibn Muti returned to Mecca in the company of Basra's governor, Ibn al-Zubayr's brother Mus'ab, in 689/90. Despite a pardon issued for him by Abd al-Malik, Ibn Muti fought and died alongside Ibn al-Zubayr during the Umayyad siege of Mecca led by al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf in late 692.

Biography  Her family were hereditary Polish nobility, who owned land in Poltava province of Russia. All three siblings joined the populist movement in the 1870s. After graduating from a Kiev gymnasium, she enrolled in a women's medical course in St Petersburg, but abandoned her studies when in order to 'live with the people'. She and her husband, Alexander Bogolomets, whom she married in 1876, moved to Kuban, where they practised medicine and distributed anti-government propaganda. In 1879, they were forced to move to Kharkiv, but she was expelled and ordered to return to her native Poltava. Instead, she moved to Kiev, where she joined the South Russian Workers' Union, founded by Nikolai Schedrin and Elizaveta Kovalskaya. She formed an intense bond with Kovalskaya, who wrote in her memoirs that \\"I trusted Bogolomets completely; I knew she took things very seriously and - unlike some of the Kievans - strictly observed conspiratorial procedures.\\". After the two leaders were arrested, in 1880, she took over leadership of the union.  Prison and Siberia  Bogomolets was arrested on a street in Kiev in January 1881, at a time when she was heavily pregnant. A search of her apartment uncovered stacks of illegal literature. She was held in Kiev prison, and gave birth to a son, Alexander, in an infirmary near the prison. The child was raised by grandparents. Tried by a military court, with nine others, in May 1881, she was sentenced to ten years in the mines in Kara katorga. She was transferred to Butyrka prison, in Moscow, and then prison in Krasnoyarsk. There, she complained to other prisoners that a warder named Ostrovsky had insulted her, though she would not repeat what he had said or done. This set off a protest in which Kovalskaya and others went on hunger strike, and a prisoner named Alexander Dolgushin slapped the offending warder. When they were moved to Irkutsk, Bogolomets and Kovalskaya insisted on travelling together. They escaped together in February 1882, but were recaptured after about two weeks. According to the American journalist George Kennan, who visited Siberia in the 1880s and interviewed political exiles, a warden named Colonel Soloviev had the two women stripped naked in his presence, then told their male comrades that they were \\"not much to look at.\\" Back in prison, Bogolomets protested by ripping up floorboards and was put in a straitjacket. Kovalskaya, who tried to prevent the wardens from binding, was put in handcuffs. Shchedrin, who was in the same prison, punched Soloviev in the face, for which he was sentenced to death, though the sentence was commuted. Bogolomets had five years added to her sentence. Transferred to Kara in March 1882, she continued to protest against her conditions, and was transferred to Irkutsk prison, and had another year added to her sentence for insulting a guard. She contracted tuberculosis in prison. Released in January 1892, she died in Kara three days later.  Family  Her husband, Alexander Mikhailovich Bogolomets (1850–1935) was in Paris in 1881, when he learnt of his wife's arrest, and returned illegally, intending to organiser her escape.but was himself arrested in January 1882, and sentenced to a year and a half in prison, followed by exile to Tobolsk, where he was permitted to resume practising medicine. He worked as a provincial doctor for many years, while effectively banned from living in any major city. in October 1890, he visited Leo Tolstoy at his home, Yasnaya Polyana, helped him with a translation, and enlisted the writer's help in obtaining permission to visit Sofya in Kara. In 1914, he settled in Moscow, where he died aged 84. Their son, Alexander Alexandrovich Bogolomets (1881–1946) was one of the leading medical academics of his generation, and President of the Ukraine Academy of Sciences in 1930 until his death. Sofya's Sister, Olga, was another member of the South Russia Workers' Union, tried, imprisoned and deported with Bogomolets and Kovalskaya. She was allowed to return to European Russia after completing her term of exile, but returned many years later to accompany one of her sons, who had been deported, and died in Siberia. Their brother, Ivan Prisetsky, was also a populist revolutionary, but later joined the Constitutional Democratic Party.

Trump enlisted surrogates within and outside his official administration, including his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr, to pressure Ukraine and other foreign governments to cooperate in supporting conspiracy theories concerning American politics. Trump blocked but later released payment of a congressionally mandated $400 million military aid package to allegedly obtain quid pro quo cooperation from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. A number of contacts were established between the White House and the government of Ukraine, culminating in a phone call between Trump and Zelensky on July 25, 2019. The scandal reached public attention in mid- September 2019 due to a whistleblower complaint made in August 2019. The complaint raised concerns about Trump using presidential powers to solicit foreign electoral intervention in the 2020 U.S. presidential election. The White House has corroborated several allegations raised by the whistleblower. A non-verbatim transcript of the Trump–Zelensky call confirmed that Trump requested investigations into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server, while repeatedly urging Zelensky to work with Giuliani and Barr on these matters. The White House also confirmed that a record of the call had been stored in a highly restricted system. Former acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said one reason why Trump withheld military aid to Ukraine was Ukrainian \\"corruption related to the DNC server\\", referring to a debunked theory that Ukrainians framed Russia for hacking into the DNC computer system. Trump has also publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. The Trump administration's top diplomat to Ukraine, Bill Taylor, testified that he was told U.S. military aid to Ukraine and a Trump–Zelensky White House meeting were conditioned on Zelensky publicly announcing investigations into the Bidens and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections. U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that he worked with Giuliani at Trump's \\"express direction\\" to arrange a quid pro quo with the Ukraine government. On September 24, 2019, the House of Representatives began a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, led by six House committees. On October 31, 2019, the House of Representatives voted to approve guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry. Trump was impeached on charges of abusing the power of his office and obstructing Congress, but was ultimately acquitted by the Senate. On December 3, 2019, as part of the impeachment inquiry, the House Intelligence Committee published a 300-page report detailing that \\"the impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one into Joe Biden, one of Trump's domestic political opponents. In pressuring President Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine.\\" In January 2020, the Government Accountability Office, a non- partisan watchdog, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding Congress-approved military aid to Ukraine.  Background  Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky The scandal came to light when a whistleblower report revealed that President Trump had asked Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky in July 2019 to investigate Joe Biden, Trump's political opponent in the 2020 presidential election, his son Hunter Biden, and company CrowdStrike, to discuss these matters with Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr. The allegations were confirmed by a non-verbatim summary of the conversation released by the White House. Trump acknowledged he had told Zelensky \\"we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\\" According to the whistleblower, the call was part of a wider campaign by Trump, his administration, and Giuliani to pressure Ukraine into investigating the Bidens, which may have included Trump's cancelling a scheduled trip to Ukraine by Vice President Mike Pence, and Trump withholding $400million in military aid from Ukraine. Immediately after the Trump–Zelensky call ended, White House national security aides discussed their deep concerns, with at least one National Security Council (NSC) official alerting White House national security lawyers. A text message between a State Department envoy to Ukraine and a Ukrainian official showed the envoy understood from the White House that a Zelensky visit with Trump was contingent upon Ukraine's investigating a conspiracy theory about alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Records of the Trump–Zelensky call were moved from the system where presidential call transcripts are typically stored to a system reserved for the government's most sensitive secrets. The Trump administration had also similarly restricted access to records of Trump's conversations with the leaders of China, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and Australia. It was subsequently revealed that this placement was made for political rather than for national security reasons. The first whistleblower complaint was filed on August 12, 2019, reportedly by a CIA officer detailed to the White House. It was based both on \\"direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct\\" and on the accounts of more than \\"half a dozen U.S. officials\\". The complaint was eventually released to congressional intelligence committees on September 25, 2019, and a redacted version of the complaint was made public the next day. On October 6, 2019, attorney Mark Zaid announced the existence of a second official whistleblower, an intelligence official with firsthand knowledge who had spoken with the inspector general of the Intelligence Community but had not yet contacted the congressional committees involved in the investigation. The whistleblower's complaint prompted a referral to the Department of Justice Criminal Division. On September 25, a Department of Justice spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, announced that the division had \\"concluded the matter\\" and determined that the call did not constitute a campaign finance violation. On October 3, after Trump publicly called for China and Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, Federal Election Commission (FEC) chair Ellen Weintraub reiterated that \\"it is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\\" Trump has denied all wrongdoing. He confirmed that he had withheld aid from Ukraine, while offering contradicting reasons for doing so. Trump first claimed it was withheld because of corruption in Ukraine, but later said it was because other nations, including those in Europe, were not contributing enough aid to Ukraine. European Union institutions provided more than twice the amount of aid to Ukraine than did the United States during 2016-17, and Trump's budget proposal sought to cut billions of dollars from U.S. initiatives to fight corruption and encourage reform in Ukraine and elsewhere. Trump has repeatedly attacked the whistleblower and sought information about the whistleblower. In October 2019, after mentioning that the U.S. has \\"tremendous power\\" in the trade war with China \\"if they don't do what we want\\", Trump publicly urged Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. As of October 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any alleged wrongdoing by the Bidens.Multiple sources:   Trump, his supporters, and right- wing media have spread multiple conspiracy theories regarding Ukraine, the Bidens, the whistleblower, and the foreign interference in the 2016 election. The scope of the scandal expanded on October 9, when arrests were made by the FBI of two of Giuliani's clients involved in political and business affairs in the U.S. and Ukraine, as well as news two days later that Giuliani himself was under federal investigation. = President Donald Trump = Before this scandal came to light, U.S. president Donald Trump indicated he would accept foreign intelligence on his political rivals. In June 2019, Trump was interviewed by George Stephanopoulos, who asked: \\"If foreigners, if Russia, if China, if someone else offers you information on an opponent, should they accept it or should they call the FBI?\\" Trump responded: \\"I think maybe you do both. I think you might want to listen. I don't. There's nothing wrong with listening. If somebody called from a country—Norway—we have information on your opponent. Oh. I think I'd want to hear it.\\" After Trump said this, the chair of the Federal Election Commission, Ellen Weintraub, reminded Americans that according to federal law: \\"It is illegal for any person to solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election.\\" Previously in July 2016, while Trump was still a candidate in the 2016 United States presidential election, he made a request: \\"Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing\\" from 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's email server. = Ukraine and the Bidens = In 2014, the Obama administration was trying to provide diplomatic support to the post-2014 Ukrainian revolution Yatsenyuk government in Ukraine, and then-vice president Joe Biden was \\"at the forefront\\" of those efforts. Biden's son Hunter Biden joined the board of directors of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company, on April 18, 2014. Hunter, then an attorney with Boies Schiller Flexner, was hired to help Burisma with corporate governance best practices, and a consulting firm in which Hunter is a partner was also retained by Burisma. In a December 2015 interview, Joe Biden said he had never discussed Hunter's work at Burisma. Joe Biden traveled to Ukrainian capital Kyiv on April 21, 2014, and urged the Ukrainian government \\"to reduce its dependence on Russia for supplies of natural gas\\". He discussed how the United States could help provide technical expertise for expanding domestic production of natural gas. Since 2012, the Ukrainian prosecutor general had been investigating Burisma's owner, oligarch Mykola Zlochevsky, over allegations of money laundering, tax evasion, and corruption. In 2015, Viktor Shokin became the prosecutor general, inheriting the investigation. The Obama administration, other governments, and non-governmental organizations soon became concerned that Shokin was not adequately pursuing corruption in Ukraine, was protecting the political elite, and was regarded as \\"an obstacle to anti-corruption efforts\\". Among other issues, he was slow-walking the investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma, to the extent that Obama administration officials were considering launching their own criminal investigation into the company for possible money laundering. Shokin has said he believes he was fired because of his Burisma investigation, where Hunter Biden was allegedly a subject. However, that investigation was dormant at the time Shokin was fired. In December 2015, then-vice president Biden visited Kyiv and informed the Ukrainian government that $1billion in loan guarantees would be withheld unless anti-corruption reforms were implemented, including the removal of Shokin. Ukraine's parliament voted to dismiss Shokin in March 2016. The loan guarantees were finally approved on June 3, after additional reforms were made. At the time, corruption in Ukraine was a matter of bipartisan concern in the U.S., with Republican Senators Rob Portman, Mark Kirk, and Ron Johnson co-signing a Senate Ukraine Caucus letter in February 2016 urging then-President Poroshenko to implement reforms, including \\"to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General's office\\". Biden was not alone in targeting Shokin for anti-corruption reasons; he was joined by other European and U.S. officials. Former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt and the assistant secretary of state Victoria Nuland both said in 2015 that Shokin's office was failing to root out corruption. In March 2016, testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, former ambassador to Ukraine John E. Herbst stated, \\"By late fall of 2015, the EU and the United States joined the chorus of those seeking Mr. Shokin's removal\\" and that Joe Biden \\"spoke publicly about this before and during his December visit to Kyiv.\\" During the same hearing, Nuland stated, \\"we have pegged our next $1 billion loan guarantee, first and foremost, to having a rebooting of the reform coalition so that we know who we are working with, but secondarily, to ensuring that the prosecutor general’s office gets cleaned up.\\" Meanwhile, protests within Ukraine were calling for Shokin's removal, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also threatened to delay $40 billion of aid in light of corruption in Ukraine. Anders Åslund, a resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said that \\"Everyone in the Western community wanted Shokin sacked... The whole G-7, the IMF, the EBRD [European Bank for Reconstruction and Development], everybody was united that Shokin must go, and the spokesman for this was Joe Biden.\\" The European Union eventually praised Shokin's dismissal due to a \\"lack of tangible results\\" of his office's investigations, and also because people in Shokin's office were themselves being investigated. Hunter Biden in 2013 As of May 16, 2019, when the prosecutor general's office cleared Biden and his son of alleged corruption, there is no evidence that Biden acted to protect his son's involvement with Burisma, although Trump, Giuliani, and their allies have fueled speculation. Shokin's successor, Yuriy Lutsenko, initially took a hard line against Burisma, but within a year, Lutsenko announced that all legal proceedings and pending criminal allegations against Zlochevsky had been \\"fully closed\\". In a related 2014 investigation by the United Kingdom, British authorities froze U.K. bank accounts tied to Zlochevsky; however, the investigation was later closed due to a lack of evidence. Lutsenko said in May 2019 that there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens, but he was planning to provide information to Attorney General William Barr about Burisma board payments so American authorities could verify whether Hunter Biden had paid U.S. taxes. In November 2019, Senator Rand Paul asserted that the whistleblower \\"is a material witness to the possible corruption of Hunter Biden and Joe Biden,\\" adding, \\"[the whistleblower] might have traveled with Joe Biden to Ukraine for all we know,\\" calling for investigators to subpoena the whistleblower. Asked for evidence to support his allegations, Paul replied, \\"we don't know unless we ask.\\" Senator Lindsey Graham, the Senate Judiciary Committee chair, responded by saying “What basis does he have to say that? He needs to tell us ... You can’t ask members [of Congress], 'Do you want to subpoena this guy?' He might be this, he might be that.” = Rudy Giuliani = Since at least May 2019, Giuliani has been pushing for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected president of Ukraine, to investigate Burisma, as well as to check if there were any irregularities in the Ukrainian investigation of Paul Manafort. On May 7, Zelensky and a group of his advisors had a three-hour meeting to discuss how to respond to Trump and Giuliani's pressure and how to avoid becoming involved in domestic American politics. Giuliani said the investigations he sought would be beneficial to President Trump, his client, and that his efforts had Trump's full support. Giuliani's efforts began as an attempt to provide cover for Trump to pardon Manafort, who had been convicted of eight felony counts in August 2018. On May 10, Giuliani canceled a scheduled trip to Ukraine where he had intended to urge president-elect Zelensky to pursue inquiries into Hunter Biden, as well as whether Democrats colluded with Ukrainians to release information about Manafort. Giuliani claimed he has sworn statements from five Ukrainians stating they were brought into the Obama White House in January 2016 and told to \\"go dig up dirt on Trump and Manafort\\", although he has not produced evidence for the claim. Giuliani asserted he cancelled the trip because he had been \\"set up\\" by Ukrainians who objected to his efforts, and blamed Democrats for trying to \\"spin\\" the trip. Giuliani met with Ukrainian officials to press for an investigation in June 2019 and August 2019. As early as May 2019, Trump instructed State Department officials attempting to set up a meeting with Zelensky to work with Giuliani. Establishing Giuliani as a gatekeeper in this fashion circumvented official channels. Responding to a motion by the liberal watchdog group American Oversight, on October 23 a federal judge gave the State Department 30 days to release Ukraine-related records, including communications between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Rudy Giuliani. On November 22, the State Department released internal emails and documents that bolstered Gordon Sondland's congressional testimony that Pompeo participated in Giuliani's activities relating to Ukraine. The documents also showed the State Department had deliberately deceived Congress about the rationale for Yovanovitch's removal as ambassador. During his call with Zelensky, Trump said, \\"I will ask [Giuliani] to call you along with the attorney general. Rudy very much knows what's happening and he is a very capable guy. If you could speak to him that would be great.\\" In November, Trump denied directing Giuliani to go to Ukraine, but days after his impeachment acquittal acknowledged that he had. Giuliani had asserted in September that \\"everything I did was to defend my client.\\" = Naftogaz = Former Secretary of Energy Rick Perry with Zelensky at Zelensky's inauguration, May 2019 Since March 2019, while Giuliani was pressing the Ukrainian administration to investigate the Bidens, a group of businessmen and Republican donors used their ties to Trump and Giuliani to try to replace the leadership of Ukrainian state-owned oil and gas company Naftogaz. The group sought to have Naftogaz contracts granted to businesses owned by allies of Trump, but this effort hit a setback when Volodymyr Zelensky won the 2019 Ukrainian Presidential Election. During a state visit for President Zelensky's inauguration in May, former Secretary of Energy Rick Perry reportedly pressured President Zelensky to fire members of the Naftogaz supervisory board, but Perry denied this, stating in a press conference on October 7: \\"That was a totally dreamed-up story\\". On October 10, Perry was issued a subpoena by the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, partially concerning his interactions with Naftogaz. The Wall Street Journal reported that Perry planned to have Amos Hochstein, a former Obama administration official, replaced as a member of the board at Naftogaz with someone aligned with Republican interests. Perry denied the reports. = Dmytry Firtash = Dmytry Firtash is a Ukrainian oligarch who is prominent in the natural gas sector. In 2017, the Justice Department characterized him as being an \\"upper echelon (associate) of Russian organized crime\\". Living in Vienna, Austria, for five years he has been fighting extradition to the U.S. on bribery and racketeering charges, and has been seeking to have the charges dropped. Firtash's attorneys obtained a September statement from Viktor Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor general who was forced out under pressure from multiple countries and non- governmental organizations, as conveyed to Ukraine by Joe Biden. Shokin asserted in the statement that Biden actually had him fired because he refused to stop his investigation into Burisma. Giuliani, who asserts he has \\"nothing to do with\\" and has \\"never met or talked to\\" Firtash, has promoted the statement in television appearances as purported evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens. Giuliani told CNN he met with a Firtash attorney for two hours in New York City at the time he was seeking information about the Bidens. Firtash is represented by Trump and Giuliani associates Joseph diGenova and his wife Victoria Toensing, having hired them on Parnas's recommendation. The New York Times reported in November that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Biden, which Parnas's attorney described was \\"part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter\\". Shokin's statement notes that it was prepared \\"at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash\\". Bloomberg News reported on October 18 that during the summer of 2019 Firtash associates began attempting to dig up dirt on the Bidens in an effort to solicit Giuliani's assistance with Firtash's legal matters, as well as hiring diGenova and Toensing in July. Bloomberg News also reported that its sources told them Giuliani's high-profile publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political quid pro quo. Later that day, The New York Times reported that weeks earlier, before his associates Parnas and Fruman were indicted, Giuliani met with officials with the criminal and fraud divisions of the Justice Department regarding what Giuliani characterized as a \\"very, very sensitive\\" foreign bribery case involving a client of his. Barr also attended the meeting. The Times did not name whom the case involved, but shortly after publication of the story Giuliani told a reporter it was not Firtash. Two days later, the Justice Department stated its officials would not have met with Giuliani had they known his associates were under investigation by the SDNY. diGenova has said he has known attorney general Bill Barr for thirty years, as they both worked in the Reagan/Bush Justice Department. The Washington Post reported on October 22 that after they began representing Firtash, Toensing and diGenova secured a rare face-to-face meeting with Barr to argue the Firtash charges should be dropped. Prior to that mid-August meeting, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Barr declined to intervene in the Firtash case. Firtash made his fortune brokering Ukrainian imports of natural gas from the Russian firm Gazprom. As vice president, Joe Biden had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate middlemen such as Firtash from the country's natural gas industry, and to reduce the country's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas. Firtash denied involvement in collecting or financing damaging information on the Bidens. = Kashyap Patel = Kashyap Patel was a national security aide for the House Intelligence Committee, under Congressman Nunes (R, CA.) during the first years of the Trump administration. He was the key author of a controversial memo which was central to the Republican narrative that FBI and DOJ officials inappropriately obtained FISA warrants for several of Trump campaign staffers, including Carter Page. Weeks later, the memo was deemed biased, consisting of \\"cherry picked facts\\". After the leadership changeover in of the House of Representatives, Patel was hired as a staffer for President Trump's National Security Council. Within months it was suspected that he had assumed the role of an additional independent back channel for the President, which was seen as potentially detrimental to American policy in Ukraine. It was noticed that during NSC meetings Patel took few notes and was underqualified for his portfolio, the United Nations. Politico reports this position was actually created specifically for Patel. Red flags were raised when President Trump referred to Patel as \\"one of his top Ukraine policy specialists\\" and as such wished \\"to discuss related documents with him\\". Patel's actual assignment has been counter-terrorism issues, rather than Ukraine. He was thought to have operated independently of Giuliani's irregular, informal channel. Impeachment inquiry witnesses have been asked what they know about Patel. Fiona Hill told investigators that it seems \\"Patel was improperly becoming involved in Ukraine policy and was sending information to Mr. Trump.\\" Sondland and Kent testified they did not come across Patel in the course of their work. On December 3, 2019, the House Intelligence Committee's report included phone records, acquired via subpoenas to AT&T; and/or Verizon Wireless, including a 25-minute phone call between Patel and Giuliani on May 10, 2019. The call occurred after Giuliani and Patel attempted to call each other for several hours, and less than an hour after a call between Giuliani and Kurt Volker. Five minutes after the 25-minute call between Giuliani and Patel, an unidentified \\"-1\\" phone number called Giuliani for over 17 minutes, after which Giuliani called his now-indicted associate Lev Parnas for approximately 12 minutes. In a statement to CBS News on December 4, Patel denied being part of Giuliani's Ukraine back-channel, saying he was \\"never a back channel to President Trump on Ukraine matters, at all, ever\\", and that his call with Giuliani was \\"personal\\". After Richard Grenell was named acting director of national intelligence in February 2020, Patel was added as a senior adviser on February 20.  Campaign against Marie Yovanovitch  As early as April 2018, Rudolph W. Giuliani and his associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman had apparently decided to assist President Trump's re-election efforts and they identified the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch as being a difficulty. Yovanovitch had spent her thirty-year career working as a diplomat and was announced as the nominee for U.S. ambassador to Ukraine on May 18, 2016, to replace Geoff Pyatt. Yovanovitch was respected within the national security community for her efforts to encourage Ukraine to tackle corruption, and during her tenure had sought to strengthen the Ukrainian National Anti-Corruption Bureau, which had been created to bolster efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine. As U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Yovanovitch became the target of a conspiracy-driven smear campaign. Allegations against her were then made by Trump's personal attorney Giuliani, as well as conservative commentator John Solomon of The Hill and Ukraine's then-top prosecutor, Yuri Lutsenko, who accused her of being part of a conspiracy involving anti-corruption probes in Ukraine and efforts by the Trump administration to investigate ties between Ukrainian officials and the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign. Lutsenko, who has been accused by Ukrainian civil society organizations of corruption, claimed that Yovanovitch, an Obama administration appointee, had interfered in Ukraine politics, had given him a \\"do-not-prosecute\\" list and was interfering in his ability to combat corruption in Ukraine. The U.S. State Department said that Lutsenko's allegations against Yovanovitch were \\"an outright fabrication\\" and indicated that they were a \\"classic disinformation campaign.\\" Lutsenko subsequently recanted his claims of a \\"do-not-prosecute\\" list. Solomon's stories were nonetheless amplified by President Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr., Giuliani, Solomon, and conservative media outlets. Ukrainians who opposed Yovanovitch were also sources for Giuliani, who \\"was on a months-long search for political dirt in Ukraine to help President Trump.\\" Giuliani confirmed in a November 2019 interview that he believed he \\"needed Yovanovitch out of the way\\" because she was going to make his investigations difficult. On April 24, 2019, after complaints from Giuliani and other Trump allies that Yovanovitch was undermining and obstructing Trump's efforts to persuade Ukraine to investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential election candidate Joe Biden, Trump ordered Yovanovitch's recall. She returned to Washington, D.C., on April 25, with her recall becoming public knowledge on May 7, and her mission as ambassador being terminated on May 20, 2019. In a July 25, 2019 phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky (the contents of which became public on September 25 2019), Trump pressured the Ukrainian government to investigate Biden and disparaged Yovanovitch to his foreign counterpart, calling her \\"bad news\\". Documents to the House Intelligence Committee provided by Lev Parnas outlined text exchanges in which Lutsenko pushed for the ouster of Yovanovitch and in return offered to provide damaging information on Joe Biden. In Russian-language messages, Lutsenko told Parnas that Yovanovitch-- referred to as \\"madam\\"--should be ousted before he would make helpful public statements; for example, in a March 22, 2019 WhatsApp message to Parnas, Lutsenko wrote, \\"It's just that if you don’t make a decision about Madam—you are calling into question all my declarations. Including about B.\\" It is thought that Lutsenko targeted Yovanovitch due to her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. One week before an April 1, 2019 conference on anti-corruption, Parnas exchanged encrypted WhatsApp text messages with Robert F. Hyde that indicated the ambassador was under surveillance and that her security was at risk. Hyde claimed he had merely forwarded messages received from a Belgium citizen named Anthony de Caluwe. After the House Intelligence Committee released the text messages, de Caluwe initially denied any involvement, but then reversed himself, saying that he had in fact sent the messages to Hyde but that the messages were a joke and \\"just a part of a ridiculous banter.\\" An audio tape from April 2018, recorded at a private dinner between Trump and top donors and made public by ABC News in January 2020, captures Trump demanding Yovanovitch's removal, saying: \\"Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.\\" The recording appeared to corroborate Parnas's account that he had told Trump that night that Yovanovitch was working against him. Yovanovitch's abrupt ouster shocked and outraged career State Department diplomats. Acting Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Philip Reeker, the chief diplomat for U.S. policy for Europe, testified that he had urged top State Department officials David Hale and T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, to issue a statement expressing strong support for Yovanovitch, but that top State Department leadership rejected this proposal. Former senior U.S. diplomats Philip Gordon and Daniel Fried, who served as assistant secretaries of state for European and Eurasian Affairs and as National Security Council staffers under presidents of both parties, praised Yovanovitch and condemned Trump's \\"egregious mistreatment of one of the country's most distinguished ambassadors,\\" writing that this had demoralized the U.S. diplomatic corps and undermined U.S. foreign policy. The American Foreign Service Association and American Academy of Diplomacy, representing members of the U.S. diplomatic corps, expressed alarm at Trump's disparagement of Yovanovitch in his call with Zelensky. Michael McKinley, a career foreign service officer who served as ambassador to four countries and had been chief adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, resigned in October 2019 in protest of Trump's attacks against Yovanovitch and \\"the State Department's unwillingness to protect career diplomats from politically motivated pressure.\\" Yovanovitch's ouster became one of the issues explored in the House of Representatives impeachment inquiry against Trump; her recall was termed \\"a political hit job\\" by Democratic members of Congress. Trump subsequently said she was \\"no angel\\" and falsely claimed that Yovanovitch had refused to hang his portrait.  Communications with Ukrainian officials  Marie Yovanovitch, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine was prematurely released from her post because of her anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine, and because she disagreed with the shadow diplomacy taking place under Giuliani and President Trump. Letter from the chairs of the House Committees on Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, and Foreign Affairs, including copies of text-message conversations involving Volker, Sondland, and others On September 20, 2019, The Washington Post reported that Trump had in a July 25 phone conversation repeatedly pressed Ukrainian president Zelensky to investigate matters relating to Hunter Biden. The New York Times reported that Trump told Zelensky to speak to Giuliani, and according to The Wall Street Journal, he urged Zelensky \\"about eight times\\" to work with Giuliani and investigate Biden's son. On September 22, Trump acknowledged he had discussed Joe Biden during the call with Zelensky, and that he had said: \\"We don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\\" As of October 2019, there has been no evidence produced of any of the alleged wrongdoing by the Bidens. The Wall Street Journal reported on September 30 that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also listened in on the call. Two days later, The Washington Post reported that Vice President Mike Pence's national security advisor Keith Kellogg had listened in on the call as well, and that \\"Pence should have had access to the transcript within hours.\\" Others on the line included Tim Morrison, the National Security Council's senior director for Europe and Russia; Robert Blair, an aide to Mick Mulvaney; and Alexander Vindman, a Ukraine expert for the NSC. Days before Trump's July 25 call with Zelensky, Giuliani spoke on the phone with Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak about a Biden investigation, as well as a prospective White House meeting between Zelensky and Trump that was sought by Ukrainian officials. According to Zelensky's advisor Serhiy Leshchenko, Trump was willing to have a phone conversation with Zelensky only on the precondition that they discuss the possibility of investigating the Biden family. Leshchenko later sought to backtrack his comments, saying he did not know if officials had viewed discussing Biden as a precondition for a meeting. Text messages given to Congress by special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker in October suggest that Zelensky's aide Yermak was told that Zelensky would be invited for a White House visit only if he promised to carry out the requested investigations. On July 25, just before Trump's phone call, Volker texted to Yermak: \\"heard from White House—assuming PresidentZ convinces trump he will investigate / 'get to the bottom of what happened' in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington.\\" On September 25, the administration released the White House's five-page, declassified memorandum of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky. In the call, Trump pressed for an investigation into the Bidens and CrowdStrike, saying: \\"I would like to have the [U.S.] attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it.\\" Trump falsely told Zelensky \\"Biden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution\\" of his son, Hunter; Biden did not stop any prosecution, did not brag about doing so, and there is no evidence his son was ever under investigation. Trump also presented Giuliani as a key U.S. contact for Ukraine, although Giuliani holds no official U.S. government position. Trump said three times that he would ask both Attorney General Barr and Giuliani to call Zelensky, and added: \\"So whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great.\\" In response, Zelensky said his candidate for Ukraine's chief prosecutor \\"will look into the situation, specifically to the company that you mentioned in this issue\\". After Zelensky said this, Trump offered to meet with Zelensky at the White House. On the same call with Zelensky, Trump espoused the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton's email server was in Ukraine; criticized the U.S.'s European allies (in particular Germany), and disparaged the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, a career U.S. diplomat whom the Trump administration had abruptly recalled two months earlier. Trump told Zelensky that Yovanovitch was \\"going to go through some things\\". During the conversation, Zelensky mentioned that on his last visit to the U.S., he had stayed in Trump Tower. Ethics advocacy groups described this comment as an attempt to curry favor. Shortly after the conversation, White House aides began asking one another whether they should alert other senior officials who had not participated. The first whistleblower described one White House official as being \\"visibly shaken by what had transpired\\". In a July 26 memo, the whistleblower reported, \\"The official stated that there was already a conversation underway with White House lawyers about how to handle the discussion because, in the official's view, the president had clearly committed a criminal act by urging a foreign power to investigate a U.S. person for the purposes of advancing his own re-election bid in 2020.\\" During the period prior to and immediately after the July 25 call, at least four national security officials warned National Security Council legal adviser John Eisenberg that the Trump administration was attempting to pressure Ukraine for political purposes. Days after the Trump call, Giuliani met with Yermak in Madrid. Giuliani said on September 23 that the State Department had asked him to \\"go on a mission for them\\" to speak with Yermak. The State Department had said on August 22 that its Ukraine envoy Volker had connected the men, but that Giuliani was acting as a private citizen and Trump attorney, although he briefed the State Department after the trip. Giuliani said he told Yermak, \\"Your country owes it to us and to your country to find out what really happened.\\" Yermak said he was not clear if Giuliani was representing Trump, but Giuliani said he was not, and the White House referred questions about Giuliani's role to the State Department, which did not respond. Appearing on television on September 19, Giuliani first denied he had asked Ukrainian officials to investigate Joe Biden, but moments later said, \\"Of course I did.\\" Former prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko told the Los Angeles Times Giuliani had repeatedly demanded that the Ukrainians investigate the Biden family. \\"I told him I could not start an investigation just for the interests of an American official,\\" Lutsenko informed the Times. In August, Volker and American ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland drafted a statement they wanted Zelensky to read publicly that would commit Ukraine to investigate Burisma and the conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton. However, Zelensky never made the statement. Volker also provided to congressional investigators a September text message exchange between Sondland, a major Trump donor and political appointee, and Bill Taylor, a career diplomat who was the senior official at the Ukrainian embassy after the recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch. In the messages, Taylor wrote: \\"I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\\" Four hours later, after speaking with Trump, Sondland responded: \\"Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intentions. The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of any kind.\\" He then suggested they continue discussing the matter by phone rather than text. The Washington Post reported on October 12 that Sondland would tell congressional investigators the following week that he had relayed Trump's assertion of no quid pro quo, but he did not know if it was actually true. NBC News reported the night before Sondland's testimony that he told Ukrainian officials visiting the White House that a Trump–Zelensky meeting was conditioned on Ukraine opening an investigation, and discussed Burisma with them. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2019 that prior to the Trump–Zelensky call, Sondland had kept several administration officials apprised via email of his efforts to persuade Ukraine to open investigations. American embassy officials in Kyiv repeatedly expressed concerns about Giuliani's meetings, and during closed-door congressional testimony on October 4, Volker reportedly said he had warned Giuliani that Ukrainian political figures were giving him untrustworthy information about the Bidens. He also testified that Joe Biden was a \\"man of integrity\\", saying: \\"I have known former vice president Biden for 24 years, and the suggestion that he would be influenced in his duties as vice president by money for his son simply has no credibility to me. I know him as a man of integrity and dedication to our country.\\" = Memorandum record of the July 25 phone call = The first whistleblower's report said that \\"senior White House officials had intervened to 'lock down' all records of the phone call\\", an act that indicated those officials \\"understood the gravity of what had transpired\\". They performed the \\"lock down\\" by placing the record of the call on a top-secret server intended for the most highly classified material, under the direction of John Eisenberg. It was later confirmed that on orders from National Security Council attorneys, the call with Ukraine was moved from TNet, the regular NSC computer system, to the top- secret codeword NICE system, reserved for closely guarded secrets. On September 27, it was reported that records of calls with the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Russia had also been stored on NICE. On September 27, the White House acknowledged that a record of the call between Trump and Zelensky was sealed in a highly classified system, as per the advice of National Security Council lawyers. On the same day, it was reported that the records of Trump's Oval Office meeting with Russian officials in May 2017 had been unusually closely held, with distribution limited to a few officials. White House advisor Kellyanne Conway said the procedure for handling records of Trump's calls with world leaders had been tightened early in 2017 because of leaks to the press about his conversations with the president of Mexico and the prime minister of Australia. It was subsequently revealed that this placement on the top-secret server was made for political rather than for national security reasons, which are the only valid reasons to use such a server, and that it happened after the White House's top Ukraine adviser, Alexander Vindman, told White House lawyer John Eisenberg that \\"what the president did was wrong\\". This conversation occurred immediately after Trump's phone call with Zelensky, and, according to people familiar with Vindman's account, it was Eisenberg who proposed this placement and restriction of access to the \\"Memorandum of Telephone Conversation\\" (i.e., the \\"rough transcript\\" of the phone call). On October 2, Trump falsely asserted that the publicly released memorandum was \\"an exact word-for-word transcript of the conversation\\". Analysts noted that its use of ellipses to denote omitted material was uncommon for government transcripts, and that it was surprisingly brief for a thirty-minute conversation, even allowing for the time delays due to the use of an interpreter. During his October 29 testimony, European Affairs Lt. Col Alexander Vindman said the memorandum of the call released by the White House omitted crucial words and phrases, including Trump asserting that recordings exist of Joe Biden discussing Ukraine corruption, which Trump stated in the third set of ellipses in the released memorandum. Vindman said he tried but failed to restore the omitted text. A senior White House official had asserted when the Memorandum was released that the ellipses \\"do not indicate missing words or phrases\\", but rather \\"a trailing off of a voice or pause\\". The New York Times states that \\"There is no [audio] recording of the July 25 call by the American side.\\" Both attorney general Bill Barr and White House counsel Pat Cipollone had recommended Trump publicly release the memorandum, asserting it showed the president did nothing wrong. During ensuing days, Trump and his allies strongly encouraged the public to read the \\"transcript\\", even as the consensus view of legal analysts was that the memorandum implicated rather than exonerated the president. Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney advised Trump that releasing the memorandum had been a mistake, causing the president to become irked by the advice Barr had given him. = Withholding of Ukrainian military aid = The U.S. Congress had mandated increased military aid to Ukraine over the period of Trump's presidency. Congress appropriated $400million in military aid to Ukraine for fiscal year 2019, to be used to spend on weapons and other equipment as well as programs to assist the Ukrainian military in combating threats from Putin's Russia and Russian-backed separatists of the self-proclaimed separatist entities in eastern Ukraine. The administration notified Congress in February 2019 and May 2019 that it intended to release this aid to Ukraine, with the Defense Department certifying that Ukraine had made sufficient progress in fighting corruption. Despite the notifications to Congress, in June 2019, the Trump administration placed military aid to Ukraine on hold. The date of the hold was originally reported as mid-July. The Washington Post reported on September 23 that at least a week before his July 25 call with Zelensky, Trump directed his acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. This directive was conveyed by the Office of Management and Budget to the State Department and Pentagon, stating Trump had concerns about whether the money should be spent, with instructions to tell lawmakers the funds were being delayed due to an \\"interagency process\\". The New York Times reported that \\"high-level Ukrainian officials\\" were aware that the Trump administration had purposely frozen the military aid by the first week of August 2019, and they were told to contact Mick Mulvaney to resolve the matter. During an October 17 press conference, White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said he \\"was involved with the process\\" of the freezing of military aid. Mulvaney gave his account of why Trump decided to hold back military aid to Ukraine. One, Trump felt the other European countries were not doing enough. Two, Trump felt Ukraine was a \\"corrupt place\\" which included having \\"corruption related to the DNC server\\" with regard to \\"what happened in 2016\\". As a result, reporter Jonathan Karl told Mulvaney \\"what you just described is a quid pro quo. It is: 'Funding will not flow unless the investigation into the Democratic server happens as well.'\\" Mulvaney replied to Karl: \\"We do that all the time with foreign policy... Get over it. There's going to be political influence in foreign policy.\\" Later in the press conference, Mulvaney quoted a third reason on why military aid was frozen—they had yet to cooperate with a U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. After media reports of Mulvaney's comments circulated, Republicans joined Trump's aides and legal counsel in distancing themselves from his remarks. A senior official in the Justice Department stated: \\"If the White House was withholding aid from Ukraine with regard to any investigation by the Justice Department, that's news to us.\\" Hours later on the same day where he had issued the press conference, Mulvaney criticized the media for their coverage of his comments and denied his earlier remarks, saying that there was \\"no quid pro quo\\" regarding the withholding of aid and requests to investigate the Democrats' behavior during the 2016 election. In the July 25 call with Trump, Zelensky thanked Trump for the U.S.'s \\"great support in the area of defense\\", an apparent reference to military aid, and expressed an interest in acquiring more missiles. Trump replied, \\"I would like you to do us a favor though,\\" suggesting an investigation into CrowdStrike, an American cybersecurity firm that investigated the cyberattacks against the Democratic National Committee in 2015 and 2016. CrowdStrike was one of three firms whose analysis assisted the U.S. intelligence community in determining that Russian intelligence was responsible for the DNC hack. Trump also asked Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Ukraine relies on extensive American military aid to fight Russian-backed separatists in the Donbass, and the Trump administration's suspension of the congressionally-mandated aid was reportedly a shock to Ukrainian government officials who found out about it only \\"much later, and then through nonofficial channels\\". Trump's addition of the word \\"though\\" has been interpreted as a condition made by Trump that his decisions would be based on Ukraine's compliance with his requests. On September 9, on hearing about the whistleblower complaint, three Democratic-controlled House committees—the Committee on Foreign Affairs, the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, and the Committee on Oversight and Reform—announced they would investigate whether Trump and Giuliani attempted to coerce Ukraine into investigating the Bidens by withholding the military aid. On September 11, the Trump administration released the aid. In a September 20 tweet, Giuliani appeared to confirm suspicion that there was a connection between the withholding of military assistance funds and the investigation he and Trump wanted Ukraine to undertake. He said: \\"The reality is that the President of the United States, whoever he is, has every right to tell the president of another country you better straighten out the corruption in your country if you want me to give you a lot of money. If you're so damn corrupt that you can't investigate allegations—our money is going to get squandered.\\" Trump himself appeared to make a similar connection on September 23, telling reporters: \\"We want to make sure that country is honest. It's very important to talk about corruption. If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?\\" Trump later denied pressuring Ukraine. While the aid was restored in time to prevent any military setbacks, Trump's withholding of military aid took a heavy psychological toll on the Ukraine soldiers. Trump has offered inconsistent justifications for withholding the aid. He originally said that the aid was withheld due to \\"corruption\\" in the country and that the topic of conversation with Volodymyr Zelensky was about \\"the fact that we don't want our people, like vice- president Biden and his son, [adding] to the corruption already in the Ukraine\\". He later disputed his original statement and said the aid was initially held back due to a lack of similar contribution from other European nations. Republican senator Ron Johnson told The Wall Street Journal in October that American ambassador Gordon Sondland told him in August that military aid to Ukraine was linked to the desire of Trump and his allies for the Ukrainian government to investigate matters related to the 2016 American elections. Sondland told a State department diplomat in September via text message that there was no quid pro quo. On October 12, however, The Washington Post reported that, according to a person familiar with Sondland's testimony, Sondland plans to testify to Congress that the content of that text message \\"was relayed to him directly by President Trump in a phone call\\" and that he did not know if the claim denying quid pro quo was actually true. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 10 that career civil servants at the Office of Management and Budget were concerned about the legality of freezing the aid funds, and that the White House granted a political appointee, Michael Duffey, the authority to keep the aid on hold. Partially redacted OMB emails released to the Center for Public Integrity on December 20 showed that Duffey initiated action to freeze the Ukrainian aid about 90 minutes after the July 25 Trump–Zelensky call, writing to OMB and Pentagon officials, \\"given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute direction.\\" Unredacted versions of the emails subsequently acquired by Just Security showed that the Pentagon repeatedly pushed back against the hold, citing legal concerns, but Duffey stated, \\"clear direction from POTUS to continue to hold\\". Just Security reported that the original redactions had been made by the Justice Department. Another series of heavily redacted emails released on January 21, 2020 showed that the OMB was laying the groundwork to freeze the Ukraine aid on the night of July 24, prior to the July 25 Trump–Zelensky call. An enclosed \\"Ukraine Prep Memo\\" was redacted in its entirety. On January 16, 2020, the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a non-partisan watchdog agency, concluded that the White House broke federal law by withholding of Congress-approved military aid to Ukraine. The agency concluded that the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 had been violated because Congress' legislated policy had been supplanted by President Trump's own policy. The agency also concluded that the withholding \\"was not a programmatic delay\\", in spite of the Trump administration's claim that it was so. As the second week of the Trump impeachment trial was set to begin in January 2020, The New York Times reported that Bolton wrote in his forthcoming book that the president had told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing the Ukraine aid until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. = Withholding of White House visit = In a May 2019 letter congratulating Zelensky on his election, Trump raised the possibility of a White House visit. However, during the next few months as Giuliani and some State Department officials pressed Zelensky to investigate Burisma and the 2016 election, a White House visit became one of the inducements offered or withheld depending on Zelensky's cooperation. Bill Taylor, the United States' senior diplomatic official in Ukraine, testified in a congressional hearing that he learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky \\"was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections\\". Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who became Trump's primary connection to Ukraine, testified that Trump had told him he was \\"skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti- corruption\\" and directed him to speak to Giuliani about his concerns. Sondland began working with Giuliani and conveyed the message about investigations to the Ukrainians. In August, Sondland texted that the White House visit would be scheduled just as soon as Zelensky confirmed that he would issue a public statement about investigations into the Bidens and the 2016 election. In his November 20 testimony before the impeachment hearings, Sondland testified that the White House visit was conditioned on a public Ukrainian announcement of investigation into Burisma and the 2016 election, which he described as a quid pro quo. In testimony before congressional committees, the National Security Council's head of European Affairs, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, testified that Sondland had told Ukrainian officials in his presence that they would have to launch investigations into the Bidens in order to get a meeting with Trump. He said Sondland indicated that \\"everything\\"—including the military aid and the White House visit—was on the table pending Zelensky's public announcement of such an investigation.  Whistleblower complaints  = First whistleblower complaint =  Submission of complaint and withholding from Congress  A redacted version of the whistleblower complaint On August 12, 2019, an unnamed CIA officer filed a whistleblower complaint with Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the Intelligence Community (ICIG), under the provisions of the Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA). Atkinson looked into the complaint and interviewed several government officials whom the whistleblower identified as having information to substantiate his claims. On August 26, having found the complaint to be both \\"credible\\" and \\"of urgent concern\\" (as defined by the ICWPA), and noting the \\"subject matter expertise\\" of the whistleblower, Atkinson transmitted the complaint to Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence (DNI). Prior to the whistleblower filing the formal ICIG complaint, the individual notified the CIA of his/her concerns, which were then relayed to the White House and Justice Department. The New York Times reported in November that Trump was told of the whistleblower complaint in late August, before it was known by Congress and before the Ukraine aid was released. Maguire withheld the complaint from congressional intelligence committees, citing the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel's rationale that the whistleblower complaint did not relate to an \\"intelligence activity within the responsibility and authority\\" of the acting DNI. Maguire also testified that the whistleblower \\"followed the law every step of the way\\". In an October 2019 letter, about 70 inspectors general from the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency sharply criticized the Justice Department's decision to withhold the complaint from Congress, recommending the OLC memo be withdrawn or amended because it \\"effectively overruled the determination by the ICIG regarding an 'urgent concern' complaint\\" that the ICIG concluded was \\"credible and therefore needed to be transmitted to Congress\\". Under ICWPA, the DNI \\"shall\\" within seven days of receipt forward the complaint to the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. Maguire did not do so, and the deadline passed on September 2. On September9 Atkinson wrote to several lawmakers, telling them about the existence of the whistleblower report, which Maguire had not forwarded to Congress. On September 10, House Intelligence Committee (HPSCI) chairman Adam Schiff wrote to Maguire, asking why he had not provided it. According to Schiff, Maguire said he had been told to withhold it on direction from a \\"higher authority\\" because it involved an \\"issue of privileged communications\\". Schiff said he was also told \\"the complaint concerns conduct by someone outside of the Intelligence Community.\\" The Trump administration withheld the complaint on the basis of the Justice Department's assertion that the complaint was not within the purview of the ICWPA. On September 13, Schiff subpoenaed Maguire to appear before the HPSCI, and Maguire agreed to testify on September 26. The Washington Post reported that Maguire threatened to resign if the White House sought to constrain his testimony, although Maguire later denied he had contemplated resigning. On September 18, The Washington Post broke the story of the whistleblower report, saying the complaint concerned a \\"promise\\" Trump had made during communication with an unnamed foreign leader. White House records showed Trump had made communications or interactions with five foreign leaders during the five weeks before the whistleblower complaint was filed. During a previously scheduled closed-door hearing before the HPSCI on September 19, Atkinson told lawmakers the complaint referred to a series of events, and that he disagreed with the position that the complaint lay outside the scope of the ICWPA, but declined to provide details. On September 19, The Washington Post reported that the complaint related to Ukraine. After the ICIG found that the call was a possible violation of federal campaign finance laws, which prohibits the solicitation of foreign contributions, the ICIG referred the matter to the FBI, and the DNI referred the matter to the U.S. Department of Justice for a possible criminal investigation of Trump's actions. Courtney Simmons Elwood, general counsel for the CIA, became aware of the whistleblower's complaint through a colleague and, on August 14, made what she considered a criminal referral of the matter during a conference call with the top national security lawyer at the White House and the chief of the Justice Department's National Security Division. A Justice Department official said the ICIG suspected the call could have broken federal law if Trump's request to the Ukrainian government to investigate a political opponent constituted the solicitation of campaign contribution from a foreign government. According to a Justice Department spokeswoman, the department's criminal division reviewed \\"the official record of the call\\" and determined there was no campaign finance violation. The Justice Department's determination to not launch an investigation took only weeks; the department did not conduct interviews or take steps beyond reviewing the call record. A senior Justice Department official told The Washington Post the Justice Department had determined Trump's conduct did not constitute the solicitation of a quantifiable \\"thing of value\\" subject to the campaign finance laws. The Justice Department's review looked into whether there was evidence of a campaign violation law, and did not look into possible violations of federal corruption statutes. Some legal experts said there seemed to be evidence warranting an investigation into both; for example, Richard L. Hasen, an election-law scholar, believes the provision of opposition research, e.g. valuable information about a political rival, could be considered a contribution in kind under campaign finance law.  Release and substance of the complaint  On September 24, the top Democrats of the House and Senate intelligence committees said an attorney for the whistleblower had contacted the committees about providing testimony. Members and staff of congressional intelligence committees were allowed to examine the whistleblower complaint on September 25. After the release of the whistleblower complaint to congressional committees, Republican senators Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney called the complaint contents \\"really troubling\\" and \\"troubling in the extreme\\", respectively. That same day, the complaint itself was declassified with \\"minimal redactions\\". The House Intelligence Committee released the declassified, redacted version of the complaint on September 26. In the complaint, the whistleblower said Trump abused the powers of his office for personal gain and put national security in danger, and that White House officials engaged in a cover-up. The whistleblower wrote: > In the course of my official duties, I have received information from > multiple U.S. government officials that the President of the United States > is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign > country in the 2020 U.S. election. This interference includes, among other > things, pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the President's > main domestic political rivals. In addition to the July 25 phone call between Trump and the Ukrainian president Zelensky, the whistleblower alleged that Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, had engaged in a campaign to pressure Ukrainian authorities to pursue Joe Biden, including in an August2 meeting in Madrid between Giuliani and Zelensky aide as \\"a direct followup\\" to the July 25 call and contact with a number of other officials in Zelensky's government. These officials included Zelensky's Chief of Staff, Andriy Bohdan, and the then-acting head of the Security Service of Ukraine, Ivan Bakanov. The whistleblower further alleged in the complaint that White House officials had tried to limit access to the record of Trump's telephone conversation with Zelensky, writing: > In the days following the phone call, I learned from multiple U.S. officials > that senior White House officials had intervened to \\"lock down\\" all records > of the phone call, especially the word-for-word transcript of the call that > was produced—as is customary—by the White House Situation Room. This set of > actions underscored to me that White House officials understood the gravity > of what had transpired in the call.  Confirmation  By the end of October the bulk of the whistleblower complaint had been confirmed by other sources, including the memorandum record of the July 25 call which the White House released, testimony before congressional committees, and independent reporting. According to a The New York Times editorial titled \\"Thanks, Whistle-Blower, Your Work Is Done\\", only one minor item reported in the whistleblower complaint has not yet been confirmed: that T. Ulrich Brechbuhl, the Counselor for the State Department, also listened to the call.  Identity  Trump has repeatedly called for the identity of the whistleblower to be revealed, as have some Republican congress members, particularly Senator Rand Paul, who blocked a Senate resolution reaffirming protection for whistleblowers, and has demanded that the media print the person's name. Around November 1, an alleged identity began to circulate on right-wing publications and social media. Major news outlets have refused to publish the rumored identity of the whistleblower, and Facebook and YouTube announced plans to delete all mentions of the name. Twitter is allowing posts containing the alleged whistleblower's name, and Donald Trump Jr. was criticized for publishing such posts on his account on November 6. Publicly identifying the whistleblower's name may contravene provisions of the Inspector General Act of 1978, the Intelligence Authorization Act, the ICWPA, the Whistleblower Protection Act, and a Presidential Policy Directive dated 2012. Senator Rand Paul and Trump Jr. both argued that naming the whistleblower is not a crime, and Robert S. Litt, former general counsel for the National Intelligence Office, said that members of Congress would be \\"absolutely immune\\" from prosecution under the Speech and Debate Clause, although they could be subject to congressional sanctions. = Second whistleblower complaint = A second whistleblower, also an intelligence official, came forward on October 5, 2019, with \\"first-hand knowledge of allegations\\" associated with the phone call between Trump and Zelensky, according to Mark Zaid, a lawyer on the team representing both whistleblowers. Zaid stated that the second whistleblower had been interviewed by the ICIG but had not at that time filed a written complaint. Nor, as of October 6, had the second whistleblower communicated with any committee in the House of Representatives. As of October 6, it is not known whether this intelligence official is the same individual mentioned in a New York Times report from October4 about an intelligence official who was then weighing the possibility of filing an ICIG complaint and testifying before Congress.  Impeachment inquiry proceedings  On September 24, 2019, a formal impeachment inquiry by the House of Representatives into President Trump was announced by House Speaker Pelosi, who said \\"The actions of the Trump presidency have revealed the dishonorable fact of the president's betrayal of his oath of office, betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections.\\" Six House committees (Judiciary, Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, and Ways and Means) began or continued their formal inquiries. The impeachment inquiry came in the wake of a whistleblower complaint alleging a widespread abuse of power and a cover-up by Trump. Concurrently, the Trump administration released a memorandum of the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, confirming that Trump had asked Zelensky to \\"look into\\" the Biden controversy as a favor. The whistleblower complaint also implicated Giuliani and U.S. attorney general William Barr as part of a wider pressure campaign directed towards the Ukrainian government. Within days, Ukraine envoy Kurt Volker resigned and three House committees issued a subpoena to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to schedule depositions for Volker and four other State Department employees, and to compel the release of documents. In a letter to House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Eliot Engel, Pompeo declined to allow the depositions until \\"we obtain further clarity on these matters\\", asserting the demand was \\"an attempt to intimidate, bully, and treat improperly, the distinguished professionals of the Department of State\\". In response to Pompeo's letter, the chairmen of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees wrote to deputy secretary of state John Sullivan that because Pompeo took part in the Trump–Zelensky call, he was now considered a witness with a conflict of interest that should preclude him from making such decisions. The congressmen also warned that witness intimidation and withholding of documents could constitute obstruction of the impeachment inquiry. Roughly an hour after Pompeo's letter was received, the State Department inspector general Steve Linick requested an \\"urgent\\" meeting with several House committees the next day, relating to documents on Ukraine. After the meeting, Democrats said Linick had provided a \\"package of disinformation, debunked conspiracy theories and baseless allegations in an envelope marked 'White House' and containing folders labeled \\"Trump Hotel. Pompeo's counselor Ulrich Brechbuhl told Linick the package presumably came from the White House. A cover sheet addressed to Pompeo indicated it was from the White House. Among the allegations in the documents was that Marie Yovanovitch, the American ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled in May 2019, had been installed by George Soros. The materials had reportedly arrived at the State department in spring 2019 and Linick had passed them on to the FBI. Giuliani later admitted he had sent some of the materials, saying, \\"They told me they were going to investigate it.\\" A subpoena was also issued to Giuliani for production of documents. The House also sought testimony from Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, whose text messages revealed his involvement with Ukrainian officials in arranging a meeting with Trump. The Trump administration blocked Sondland from testifying, claiming that the process would be a \\"totally compromised kangaroo court\\" and that \\"Republican's rights have been taken away and true facts are not allowed out for the public.\\" On October 8, the White House counsel Pat Cipollone sent an eight-page letter to Pelosi and other Democratic leaders, saying the Trump administration would refuse to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The letter asserted that the inquiry was \\"constitutionally invalid\\" and \\"violates the Constitution, the rule of law, and every past precedent\\" and objected to the inquiry's procedure. Pelosi responded that \\"The White House should be warned that continued efforts to hide the truth of the president's abuse of power from the American people will be regarded as further evidence of obstruction.\\" On October 13, House Intelligence Committee chairman Schiff announced that the initial whistleblower at the heart of the impeachment inquiry might not testify. Schiff cited concerns that the whistleblower's identity might be revealed, placing his or her personal safety at risk, and additionally said that sufficient amounts of evidence are already gathered. The House of Representatives approved guidelines for the next phase of the impeachment inquiry on October 31, 2019. = Closed-door hearings = John Bolton (left) with then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in March 2018. Fiona Hill testified that Bolton told her, \\"Giuliani's a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.\\"  Marie Yovanovitch  Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine with 30 years of foreign service, has surfaced as a key person in the impeachment inquiry. She was recalled in May 2019. On October 11, 2019, Yovanovitch told House impeachment investigators she had been informed by Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan that Trump had been pressuring the State Department to remove her from her post in Ukraine since the summer of 2018. When notified of her removal, Sullivan assured her that she had done nothing wrong and was not being recalled for cause. Yovanovitch testified that the U.S. government had removed her from office based on groundless and fabricated assertions by individuals with discernibly dubious intentions. She told the committee that she was dismissed because she had candidly disapproved of Giuliani and the office of former prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko. \\"She also noted that Lutsenko's claim that she had given him a 'do not prosecute' list was false, and that Lutsenko himself had walked it back.\\"  Fiona Hill  Fiona Hill, the former leading Russia advisor in the Trump White House, testified in a closed-door hearing on October 14, 2019, telling investigators that Giuliani ran a \\"shadow\\" foreign policy in Ukraine that circumvented normal diplomatic channels for Trump's personal benefit. According to Hill, John Bolton, who at the time was Trump's national security advisor, found the attempts to pressure Ukraine into investigating Trump's political rivals sufficiently alarming that he told her to report the operation to the National Security Council's lawyer. Bolton instructed her to inform the attorney, \\"I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up.\\" Hill told her Bolton characterized Giuliani as, in effect, \\"a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up\\". On November 21, Hill testified in open session of the House Intelligence Committee, cautioning it by declaring, \\"Right now, Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference,\\" in the 2020 election, as they had in 2016. Hill definitively stated, regarding the U.S. response to the Russian Federation cyberattacks, \\"We are running out of time to stop them. In the course of this investigation, I would ask that you please not promote politically driven falsehoods that so clearly advance Russian interests.\\" Hill also urged other insiders with knowledge of illegalities or improprieties to come forth, saying, \\"Those who have information that the Congress deems relevant have a legal and moral obligation to provide it.\\"  George Kent  George Kent is Deputy Assistant Secretary in the European and Eurasian Bureau at the U.S. Department of State, overseeing policy towards Ukraine. George Kent, a career United States diplomat, met with impeachment investigators on October 15, 2019, even though the State Department ordered him not to testify and tried to limit his testimony. He is currently the number two diplomat in the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs and has much experience in the U.S. State Department's anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine dating back to 2014. Beginning in March 2019, Kent expressed misgivings to colleagues about the pressure being applied to Ukraine by President Trump and Giuliani to carry out official inquiries into Trump's political adversaries. Kent also directed attention to Giuliani's \\"disinformation\\" operation which planned to enroll a Ukrainian prosecutor to slander Trump opponents: Joseph Biden, Marie Yovanovitch, and Ukrainians believed to have circulated harmful information about Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign chairman, during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. Internal emails submitted by the State Department's inspector general show Kent criticizing a \\"fake news smear\\" about Yovanovitch, which were touted by conservative broadcasting commentators linked with Trump. In another email, he disapproved of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was circulating allegations about Yovanovitch and said they were \\"complete poppycock\\". He also testified that, after a May 2019 meeting arranged by Mick Mulvaney, he was mostly excluded from decisions about Ukraine policymaking, calling his exclusion by President Trump's insiders—Gordon Sondland, Kurt Volker, and Rick Perry—as \\"wrong\\". The three \\"declared themselves the three people now responsible for Ukraine policy\\". At certain times, Kent was told to \\"lay low\\" on matters regarding Ukraine. In reference to Joe and Hunter Biden, those familiar with his testimony said Kent told investigators that as early as 2015 he had attempted to voice concerns about the then–vice president's son sitting on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings. Joe Biden's advisers discussed the possible conflict of interest among themselves, and one former adviser \\"had been concerned enough to mention it to Biden, though the conversation was brief\\". Kent also testified that the storylines of four Ukraine-related articles by John Solomon and featured on the Fox News programs of Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham were misleading, in some cases \\"entirely made up in full cloth\\".  Michael McKinley  Michael McKinley testified on October 16, 2019. He served directly under Mike Pompeo and his function was as a connection between Pompeo and the rest of the Foreign Service. McKinley told investigators he had resigned in early October because career U.S. diplomats were being mistreated and that there were distressing charges about efforts to coerce the Ukrainian president into conducting investigations for President Trump. He also quit due to the ramifications of collecting damaging information on domestic political opponents, the probable significant effects \\"on Foreign Service morale and the integrity of our work overseas\\", as well as the influence of career diplomats having no effect, and the lack of protection and support for career Foreign Service workers during the impeachment inquiry. The culmination of his perturbation was the recall of Ambassador Yovanovitch, which he and numerous other career diplomats saw as unjustifiable and punitive.  Gordon D. Sondland  Gordon Sondland (far right) at the inauguration of Volodymyr Zelensky on May 20, 2019 Gordon D. Sondland, the United States ambassador to Europe, is believed by some to have been at the heart of efforts to pressure Ukraine. He met with impeachment investigators on October 17. In his testimony, Sondland criticized Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine into investigating a political rival. He testified that Trump had delegated Ukraine foreign policy to Giuliani, which Sondland asserted he objected to but accepted as Trump's prerogative as president, although other witnesses had testified Sondland willfully participated even though Ukraine is not within the purview of his ambassadorship. Days after Sondland's testimony, his attorney Robert Luskin said Sondland had acknowledged in his testimony that he believed efforts by Trump and his associates to pressure Ukraine into opening investigations in exchange for a Trump–Zelensky White House meeting constituted a quid pro quo. Sondland later acknowledged in supplemental written testimony that the quid pro quo also extended to the military aid, stating he had discussed the matter with Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak.  William Taylor  Bill Taylor's prepared opening statement for his congressional testimony, delivered October 22, 2019 On October 22, 2019, William Taylor, the United States' senior diplomatic official in Ukraine, testified to congressional investigators. Taylor testified that he had learned in mid-July 2019 that a potential White House meeting between Trump and Zelensky \\"was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections\\", and that he later was told, in September 2019, that U.S. military aid to Ukraine was also dependent on such investigations—including into the Bidens. Taylor testified that other than the \\"regular, formal diplomatic processes\\" to Ukraine led by himself, there was a \\"highly irregular\\", \\"informal channel of U.S. policy-making\\" with regard to Ukraine. The informal channel began in May 2019, being \\"guided\\" by Rudy Giuliani, and also involving Kurt Volker, Gordon Sondland and Rick Perry. Taylor said that by August 2019 he had realized that the informal channel \\"was running contrary to the goals of longstanding U.S. policy\\", while the formal channel wanted \\"a strong U.S.–Ukraine partnership\\". According to Taylor, the informal channel had \\"driven\\" the idea of a White House meeting between the presidents being conditional on the investigations. Taylor noted that for a June 2019 call between himself, Zelensky, Sondland, Volker and Perry, Sondland had said that \\"he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants\\" and that \\"he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring\\". As for Trump's July 2019 call with Zelensky, Taylor said he did not receive any report regarding the call from the White House even though he was scheduled to meet Zelensky a day later. Taylor said he heard from National Security Council aide Tim Morrison that on September 1, Sondland told Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak that the military aid to Ukraine was dependent on Zelensky's pursuit of the Burisma investigation. Taylor cited Sondland's telling him in a call that Trump wanted Zelensky to publicly announce he would order the two investigations, thus placing Zelensky \\"in a public box\\". Taylor quoted Sondland stating \\"everything\\" including military aid and a Trump–Zelensky meeting was contingent on that announcement.  Laura Cooper  On October 23, 2019, Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia, testified in closed session before three congressional committees. Cooper's testimony, originally scheduled for that morning, was delayed for roughly five hours when a group of House Republicans led by Matt Gaetz (R-FL) stormed the Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) where impeachment inquiry committee meetings are being held, and refused to leave, at one point ordering pizza. The group protested what they asserted were secret Democratic hearings closed to Republicans, although 48 Republicans who are members of the three committees jointly holding the hearings were entitled to attend the hearings and some had done so. Thirteen of those members participated in the protest. Subsequent releases of testimony transcripts showed that Republicans had been given equal time to question witnesses. Democrats responded with criticism over the interruption and accused the Republicans of violating the rules governing the SCIF, which prohibit cell phones in the area. After the protest ended, Cooper completed her testimony which lasted approximately 3.5 hours. She was expected to speak about how the process works for transferring military aid to Ukraine. She is believed to have tried to get the aid released. The next day it was revealed that her attorney had received a letter from the Pentagon telling her not to testify, citing an administration-wide policy against cooperating with the probe.  Philip Reeker  Philip Reeker, a 27-year veteran of the U.S. foreign service, testified on October 26, 2019. He is the acting assistant head of the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, which oversees Ukraine. Reeker has been nominally in charge of America's Ukraine policy. However, previous impeachment inquiry testimony shows that policy was actually directed by Giuliani and political appointees. Reeker's record shows that he is \\"unassailable\\" as an apolitical diplomat and is known for his \\"professionalism\\". Reeker alerted top State Department officials that \\"lies were being spread about [Marie] Yovanovitch.\\" George Kent, who worked under Reeker overseeing Ukraine policy, emailed colleagues that Yovanovitch was the scapegoat of a \\"classic disinformation campaign\\". Reeker passed this warning on to \\"David Hale, the third-highest ranking official at the State Department, and to Ulrich Brechbuhl, the closest confidant and longtime friend of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\\". The U.S. State Department's inspector general provided these emails to impeachment investigators.  Alexander S. Vindman  Full Official Opening Statement of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman Before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, and the House Committee on Oversight and Reform October 29, 2019 Lieutenant Colonel Alexander S. Vindman served on the National Security Council. On October 29, 2019, he testified before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, Foreign Affairs, and Oversight Committees. In his opening statement, he said, \\"In Spring of 2019, I became aware of outside influencers promoting a false and alternative narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency\\" that was \\"harmful to U.S. national security\\" and which \\"undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine\\". Vindman also said that he was concerned by two events he found objectionable and which he mentioned to senior officials at the time, as well as to the National Security Council's lead attorney. The first event occurred at a July 10 meeting between Ukraine's then secretary of national security and defense council Oleksandr Danlylyuk, and then U.S. national security advisor John Bolton, which ambassadors Volker and Sondland, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry attended. At this meeting, Sondland asked Ukraine to launch investigations into the Bidens as a condition of meeting with President Trump. Vindman said Bolton cut the meeting short, and that both he and Fiona Hill told Ambassador Sondland his comments were inappropriate and that he reported his concerns to the NSC's lead counsel. The second event occurred on a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky when Trump directly asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens in exchange for military aid. Vindman said, \\"I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine, and the potential to undermine U.S. national security.\\" Three days after Vindman's testimony, Politico reported he had testified that John Eisenberg, the top National Security Council attorney, instructed him to not discuss his concerns about the content of the Trump–Zelensky call with anyone.  Tim Morrison  Tim Morrison, an official on the National Security Council, testified in a closed-door session on October 31. Morrison corroborated previous testimony by William Taylor, stating that Taylor had been \\"accurate\\" on the \\"substance\\" of their conversations, but there were two differences in the details, the first being a location of a meeting. Regarding the second difference, Morrison testified that in his September 1, 2019, conversation with Sondland, he learned that Sondland had proposed to Ukrainian presidential advisor Andriy Yermak that military aid to Ukraine was \\"conditioned on a public statement\\" by the new Ukrainian prosecutor general reopening an investigation into Burisma (Taylor's testimony was that Zelensky should make the announcement). Morrison also discussed the July 2019 Trump–Zelensky call, having listened to the call himself. He told lawmakers he \\"promptly\\" brought concerns about the call to White House lawyers because he worried a summary would be leaked with negative consequences, but he said he did not necessarily think anything illegal was discussed. = Public testimony =  November 19, 2019  Alexander Vindman said he made a report to an intelligence official about what he heard during Trump's call with the Ukrainian President and felt what the President mentioned during the phone conversation was \\"improper\\". Vice President Mike Pence's chief European security adviser Jennifer Williams testified that she listened in on the phone conversion as well. Both acknowledged the Trump administration's interest in obtaining knowledge of the Burisma controversy as well. In his public testimony, Kurt Volker amended his earlier private comments, saying that since then \\"I have learned many things that I did not know at the time of the events in question.\\" He said he did not realize there was any linkage between the military hold and the request for investigations by Ukraine, but that the information which was presented by the cascade of witnesses who testified before the House later resulted in him gaining a different perspective. He also says he didn't understand that talk about investigating Burisma was actually intended to target the Bidens. He added, \\"In retrospect, I should have seen that connection differently, and had I done so, I would have raised my own objections.\\" During his testimony, Tim Morrison detailed a quid pro quo, stating that Sondland had told him that when Sondland had discussed the U.S. aid with a Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak on September1, he told Yermak Ukraine \\"would have to have the prosecutor general make a statement with respect to the investigations as a condition of having the aid lifted\\".  November 20, 2019  Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland testified that he conducted his work with Giuliani at the \\"express direction of the president\\" and that he believed Giuliani was assigned to lead the Ukrainian quid pro quo scheme on Trump's behalf. He also said everyone in the administration \\"was in the loop\\", specifically naming John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, Ulrich Brechbuhl and Mike Pence, saying \\"they knew what they were doing and why\\". Sondland also said Trump had never directly told him the aid package to Ukraine was related to the announcement of investigations, but that Sondland nevertheless believed it was and that he understood a potential White House invitation for Zelensky to be contingent on Ukraine announcing investigations into the 2016 elections and Burisma. The same day, Laura Cooper, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia, testified that Ukrainian officials knew about the hold on military aid by July 25, the day of the Trump–Zelensky call, undercutting an assertion that there could not have been a quid pro quo because Ukraine was not aware of the hold. David Hale, who serves as the United States under secretary of state for political affairs, testified that he found out from an OMB official that aid to Ukraine was being withheld at the direction of Trump.  November 21, 2019  Fiona Hill—who until August 2019 was the top Russia expert on the National Security Council—criticized Republicans for promulgating the \\"fictional narrative\\" that Ukraine rather than Russia interfered in the 2016 election, asserting the theory was planted by Russia and played into its hands. Testifying alongside Hill was the current head of political affairs in the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, David Holmes, who said he was concerned about Giuliani's role and described Sondland, Volker and U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry as \\"The Three Amigos\\" who ran the Ukraine campaign with Trump and Giuliani. = House Intelligence Committee Report = On November 25, 2019, House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff published a letter stating that the next steps towards impeachment will be taken when a committee report regarding the impeachment inquiry will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee when Congress returns from the Thanksgiving recess. On December 3, the House Intelligence Committee voted 13–9 along party lines to adopt the report and also send it to the House Judiciary Committee. The report's preface states: > [T]he impeachment inquiry has found that President Trump, personally and > acting through agents within and outside of the U.S. government, solicited > the interference of a foreign government, Ukraine, to benefit his > reelection. In furtherance of this scheme, President Trump conditioned > official acts on a public announcement by the new Ukrainian President, > Volodymyr Zelensky, of politically-motivated investigations, including one > into President Trump's domestic political opponent. In pressuring President > Zelensky to carry out his demand, President Trump withheld a White House > meeting desperately sought by the Ukrainian President, and critical U.S. > military assistance to fight Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine. The > President engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own > presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political > rival, and to influence our nation's upcoming presidential election to his > advantage. In doing so, the President placed his own personal and political > interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to > undermine the integrity of the U.S. presidential election process, and > endangered U.S. national security. At the center of this investigation is > the memorandum prepared following President Trump's July 25, 2019, phone > call with Ukraine's President, which the White House declassified and > released under significant public pressure. The call record alone is stark > evidence of misconduct; a demonstration of the President's prioritization of > his personal political benefit over the national interest. In response to > President Zelensky's appreciation for vital U.S. military assistance, which > President Trump froze without explanation, President Trump asked for \\"a > favor though\\": two specific investigations designed to assist his reelection > efforts.  Subsequent developments  = Involvement of Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman = Subpoena issued to John M. Dowd, regarding his clients Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman are associates of Rudy Giuliani who aided him in his politically-motivated investigation into Joe Biden. They had previously worked for Dmytry Firtash, a Ukrainian oligarch being indicted by the Justice Department and believed to be involved at high levels of Russian organized crime. Their attorney John Dowd, who previously represented Trump during the Mueller investigation, told Congress in October 2019 the men were assisting Giuliani in his work on behalf of Trump. Both are Soviet-born Florida real estate businessmen and naturalized American citizens. The two were arrested on the evening of October 9, 2019, and charged with planning to direct funds from a foreign government \\"to U.S. politicians while trying to influence U.S.-Ukraine relations\\". They were arrested at Dulles International while trying to leave the U.S. en route to Vienna, Austria. Rudy Giuliani was also scheduled to fly to Vienna the following night. Their arrest, the first in the Trump-Ukraine scandal, was described as a \\"complex web of financial and political interactions linking diplomacy to alleged violations of campaign finance law\\". The head of the New York's FBI office described the investigation as \\"about corrupt behavior, deliberate lawbreaking\\". Parnas and Freeman both pleaded not guilty. Parnas's attorney said some evidence against his client could be subject to presidential executive privilege, as Giuliani had represented both Trump and Parnas. The charges have also directly connected Parnas and Fruman to the campaign to oust the United States ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, from her post and have her recalled. This occurred over many months. In 2018, the operation included Parnas and Fruman donating funds and pledging later additional money to an unnamed Congressman, who was recruited for the \\"campaign to oust her\\". Some of the funds violated campaign limits. Parnas and Fruman were also charged with unlawful campaign contributions. Former congressional representative Pete Sessions (R-Texas) correlates with campaign finance filings, identifying him as the unnamed congressman. At the time, as the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, he wrote a May 9, 2018, letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo \\"saying that Ms. Yovanovitch should be fired for privately expressing 'disdain' for the current administration\\". Earlier that day, Parnas and his business partner David Correia visited Sessions in his Capitol Hill office. Correia was arrested by the FBI at JFK International on October 16 on charges of using foreign money for political influence to advance a marijuana scheme. In 2018, Parnas and Fruman were sent by Giuliani to Ukraine to extract damaging information on Trump's U.S. political rivals. \\"Their mission was to find people and information that could be used to undermine the Special Counsel's investigation, and also to damage former vice president Joseph R. Biden.\\" Both were also at the center of the pro-Trump forces' push to remove the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine because her loyalty to President Trump was deemed deficient \\"as he pursued his agenda there\\". Also, over the course of a year beginning in 2018, the two brought Giuliani to Ukrainians who were amenable to promoting \\"a largely unsubstantiated narrative about the Bidens\\". These willing Ukrainians included Yuriy Lutsenko, a former prosecutor general of Ukraine, who was essential to aiding Giuliani's efforts to produce damaging information. In an interview published in December 2019, Giuliani stated, \\"I believed that I needed Yovanovitch out of the way. She was going to make the investigations difficult for everybody.\\" Giuliani's relationship with Parnas and Fruman is the subject of a criminal investigation by the FBI's New York field office and SDNY prosecutors. His business activities in Ukraine and potential violation of lobbying laws are under federal investigation, by FBI counterintelligence. SDNY prosecutors have examined Giuliani's bank statements. They are also investigating his finances, as well as meetings with and work for a Ukrainian city mayor. SDNY investigators have been questioning witnesses about Giuliani since August 2019, gathering information about his relationship to Parnas and Fruman. Bloomberg News reported in November 2019 that the Giuliani investigation could include charges of bribing foreign officials or conspiracy. Referring to Parnas and Fruman, on October 10 Trump said, \\"I don't know those gentlemen,\\" although that day The Wall Street Journal reported Trump had dinner with the men in the White House in early May 2018. BuzzFeed News featured photos of Lev Parnas posing with President Trump and both Parnas and Fruman posing with other Republicans in Washington, DC. Trump was photographed with Parnas as early as April 2014. On October 15, 2019, it was reported that a New York grand jury had subpoenaed former congressman Pete Sessions (R-Texas) for documents and other information about his intercommunications and cooperation with Giuliani, Parnas, and Freeman. The subpoena demonstrated that the investigation into Giuliani's relationship to Parnas and Freeman remained active, as prosecutors determine whether Giuliani engaged in any illegal behavior. Giuliani seems to be the focal point of the subpoena. Sought after documents pertain to Giuliani's business affairs in Ukraine and his connection to the ouster of the former U.S. ambassador. The unsealed indictment against Parnas says he sought the help of the congressman to dismiss the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine while sourcing the money to the congressman on behalf of \\"one or more Ukrainian government officials\\". Sessions followed up with a letter to the secretary of state requesting the ouster of the ambassador. On November 4, 2019, Parnas's new attorney Joseph Bondy said his client would cooperate with congressional investigators in their Trump impeachment inquiry. Bondy later told The New York Times that shortly before Zelensky's May 20 inauguration, Parnas traveled to Kyiv to tell the incoming government that American military aid was contingent upon Ukraine's announcing an investigation of Joe Biden. On January 14, 2020, the House Intelligence Committee released documents provided by Parnas, including text messages between Parnas and Robert Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate, in which Hyde described surveillance of Yovanovitch in Kyiv before she was recalled, including Hyde stating that she was under heavy security and \\"we have a person inside,\\" adding, \\"they are willing to help if we/you would like a price\\" and \\"guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money.\\" Two days later, Ukraine announced it was opening an investigation into the matter, while the State Department remained silent as the FBI visited Hyde's home and office. The documents also outlined text exchanges with then Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko in which he pushed for the ouster of Yovanovitch and offered information related to former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden in return. On January 15, 2020, Parnas stated in an interview that \\"President Trump knew exactly what was going on. He was aware of all my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani or the president\\" about the effort to push Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The next day, Trump again asserted that he knew nothing about Parnas. In an audio recording reportedly made by Fruman during a small dinner in April 2018, after Parnas and Fruman tell Trump that Yovanovitch was bad-mouthing him, Trump is apparently heard to say \\"Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it.\\" = Communications with other governments =  Australia  On October 1, 2019, it was reported that the transcript of a call with Australian prime minister Scott Morrison had been placed on the same top-secret server as the other transcripts. Trump was reported to have requested Morrison's aid in William Barr's investigation of the Mueller inquiry. Trump's request focused on the origins of the Mueller inquiry as a conversation between Australia's former foreign minister Alexander Downer and Trump campaign team member George Papadopoulos led to the investigation. The Australian government confirmed the call had taken place and that Morrison had articulated to the President that \\"the Australian Government has always been ready to assist and cooperate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation,\\" but did not elaborate on what, if any, assistance had been offered. In a letter to William Barr dated May 28, Joe Hockey, Australia's ambassador to the U.S., pledged that the Australian government would \\"use its best endeavours\\" to support Barr's investigation. Hockey later rejected claims that Downer had been part of a conspiracy among intelligence agencies around the world to prevent Trump's election and undermine his eventual presidency. The White House responded by dismissing the reports, claiming it was part of a routine request to grant Australian authorities access to Department of Justice resources to facilitate an investigation that had been open for several months. When questioned by a journalist, Morrison rejected Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese's accusation that he had jeopardized Australia's national security for the sake of a personal relationship with the president and instead insisted that cooperating with Barr's investigation was in the national interest. Morrison claimed that no specific request had been made of his government, but refused to go into detail as to what support had been provided, citing national security concerns.  Italy  On September 30, it was reported that Attorney General William Barr had travelled to Rome to enlist the support of Italian authorities in his investigation. Barr sought information related to a conspiracy theory that Joseph Mifsud was a Western intelligence operative who allegedly entrapped Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos in order to establish a false predicate for the FBI to open an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Contrary to the conspiracy theory, that investigation was actually initiated after the Australian government notified American authorities that its diplomat Alexander Downer had a chance encounter with Papadopoulos, who boasted about possible access to Hillary Clinton emails held by the Russian government. Mifsud was last known to be in Rome in 2017, but had since disappeared. The Washington Post reported on November 22, 2019, that the Justice Department inspector general had aggressively investigated the allegation that Mifsud had been directed to entrap Papadopoulos, but found it was without merit.  China  On October 3, Trump publicly called upon China to investigate Hunter Biden's business activities there while his father was vice president. In 2013, Biden, Devon Archer, and Chinese businessman Jonathan Li founded BHR Partners, a business focused on investing Chinese capital in companies based outside of China. In September, Trump falsely claimed Biden \\"walk[ed] out of China with $1.5 billion in a fund\\" and earned \\"millions\\" of dollars from the BHR deal. Trump discussed the political prospects of Biden, as well as former candidate Elizabeth Warren, another political rival, during a June 18 phone call with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. The record of the call was stored on the same highly restricted computer system used for the Trump–Zelensky call record. According to two people familiar with the discussion, Trump told Xi on the same call that \\"he would remain quiet on Hong Kong protests as trade talks progressed.\\" The day after Trump's call for China to investigate Hunter Biden, Senator Mitt Romney said: \\"it strains credulity to suggest that [the request] is anything other than politically motivated.\\" The Chinese foreign ministry said that the Chinese government had \\"no intention of intervening in the domestic affairs of the United States\\". Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute and a Trump advisor on trade negotiations with China, was quoted by the Financial Times on October 10: \\"I got quite a bit of background on Hunter Biden from the Chinese.\\" Pillsbury denied the quote on C-SPAN hours later, asserting: \\"I haven't spoken to the Financial Times for a month.\\" The Financial Times released an email showing Pillsbury made the statement on October 9. Pillsbury later told The Washington Post, \\"most everything I learned was already public or well-known\\" and that the Chinese \\"really, really didn't want to talk about it\\". = Release of John Bolton's manuscript = On January 26, The New York Times reported that former national security advisor John Bolton had written in a draft of his forthcoming book, The Room Where It Happened, that the president told him in August 2019 that he wanted to continue freezing $391 million in aid to Ukraine until officials there pursued investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. Trump denied Bolton's claim. The manuscript was releases after the first week of the impeachment trial, prompting House impeachment managers to call for the Senate to call Bolton as a witness. Bolton also claimed to have discussed the suspension of aid with Attorney General William Barr, and that the two had shared concerns over Trump offering personal favours to the leaders of autocratic regimes around the world, including Recep Tayyip Erdoğan in Turkey and Xi Jinping in China. The Times later reported that Bolton's manuscript described a May 2019 Oval Office meeting during which Trump directed Bolton to call Zelensky to ask him to meet with Giuliani about getting damaging information on the Bidens. Bolton reportedly wrote that Giuliani, Mulvaney and White House counsel Pat Cipollone --who, at the time of the report, was representing Trump in the impeachment trial--attended the meeting. Trump denied telling Bolton this, and Giuliani denied Mulvaney or Cipollone attended meetings related to Ukraine. Cipollone previously stated he never attended Ukraine-related meetings, and Mulvaney said he avoided Trump-Giuliani meetings so as to not jeopardize their attorney-client privilege. = Other federal investigations = In a January 2020 memo to all United States attorneys, department component heads and law enforcement agency heads,https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/1229820889669259267 deputy attorney general Jeffrey Rosen stated there \\"currently are several distinct open investigations being handled by different U.S. attorney's offices and/or department components that in some way potentially relate to Ukraine.\\" Rosen advised the addressees that Richard Donoghue, the U.S. attorney for Eastern District of New York (EDNY), had been assigned to coordinate these cases and \\"any and all new matters relating to Ukraine shall be directed exclusively to EDNY for investigation and proper handling.\\" The memo stated that existing investigations would continue to be managed by the original investigators, but that any widening or expansion of those investigations required approval by Rosen and Donoghue. Federal prosecutors had indicated in December 2019 that it was likely new charges would be brought against Parnas, Fruman and two others, as the SDNY continued to investigate Giuliani into February and the Justice Department created an \\"intake process\\" to accept and scrutinize information from him about Joe Biden. That intake process was being managed by the Pittsburgh U.S. attorney's office, headed by Scott Brady. Federal prosecutors took new steps in Giuliani-related probe Feb 14, 2020 washingtonpost.com  Reactions  = Congress = On September 22, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said if the administration continued to withhold the whistleblower complaint from Congress, \\"they will be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation.\\" House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, stating he had previously been \\"very reluctant\\" to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump, said, \\"we may very well have crossed the Rubicon here.\\" The vast majority of Republicans did not comment on the matter, with notable exceptions of senators Lindsey Graham and Mitt Romney, both of whom suggested Trump should release information to resolve the situation. On September 24, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent a sense of the Senate resolution calling for the whistleblower complaint to be immediately transmitted to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Following the release of the memorandum of the conversation between Trump and Zelensky, Senator Romney called the memorandum \\"deeply troubling\\" and asked for more information to be made public. Pelosi said the memorandum \\"confirms that the President engaged in behavior that undermines the integrity of our elections, the dignity of the office he holds and our national security\\". Some Republican senators dismissed the credibility of the whistleblower complaint as hearsay, but legal analysts subsequently found that assertions the whistleblower made in the complaint were verified by the memorandum record of Trump's telephone call. On September 26, during a House hearing, Representative Adam Schiff gave a summary of the \\"essence\\" and the \\"character\\" of the Trump–Zelensky call. One part of Schiff's retelling was not represented in the non-verbatim memorandum of the call provided by the White House, when Schiff stated: \\"And I'm going to say this only seven times so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand. Lots of it. On this and on that.\\" After Representative Mike Turner accused Schiff of \\"just making it up\\", Schiff responded that his summary \\"was meant to be at least part in parody\\" and acknowledged that \\"the president never said if you don't understand me, I'm going to say it seven more times.\\" However, Schiff argued: \\"That's the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\\" Trump supporters on television, radio, and the Internet have pressured Republicans to continue supporting Trump. Republicans who have spoken out against Trump, expressed concern, or defended the whistleblower, such as senators Mitt Romney, Charles Grassley, Ben Sasse and Representative Adam Kinzinger, have come under criticism online by right-wing websites, with Romney becoming the target of baseless conspiracy theories and virally spread disinformation. An October 21 political fact sheet release by Nancy Pelosi divided the scandal into three categories, according to the evidence, that \\"show Trump violated his oath of office\\": \\"The Shakedown\\", \\"The Pressure Campaign\\", and \\"The Cover- Up\\". Despite President Trump and his allies insisting there had been no quid pro quo, mounting evidence from witness testimony indicated there had been, leading a growing number of Senate Republicans to accept there was a quid pro quo, while maintaining it was not illegal and did not justify impeachment. The Washington Post reported that House Republicans were considering portraying Giuliani, Sondland and Mulvaney as freelancers who had acted in their own self-interests without Trump's involvement. = President Trump and the White House = President Trump answers questions from the press on September 22, 2019 In his initial comments to reporters on September 20, Trump characterized the whistleblower as \\"partisan\\", but added, \\"I do not know the identity of the whistleblower\\" and called the story \\"just another political hack job\\". Trump also said: \\"Somebody ought to look into Joe Biden's statement because it was disgraceful where he talked about billions of dollars that he's not giving to a certain country unless a certain prosecutor is taken off the case. So somebody ought to look into that,\\" suggesting the press was not reporting it. The press has reported on the Joe Biden matter for months but found no evidence of wrongdoing. On September 23, Trump asserted: \\"If a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did, if a Republican ever said what Joe Biden said, they'd be getting the electric chair right now.\\" Before the White House released a rough transcript, Trump claimed that his call with Zelensky was \\"largely congratulatory\\" and \\"largely [discussed] corruption\\". However, the White House's rough transcript showed only a short congratulatory comment and no mentions of corruption. On September 25, during a meeting with Ukrainian president Zelensky, Trump said: \\"I want [Zelensky] to do whatever he can. Biden's son walks out of Ukraine with millions and millions of dollars. I think it's a horrible thing.\\" Trump also denied explicitly tying U.S. military aid to Ukraine's corruption investigation involving Burisma Holdings. Within six hours of the impeachment inquiry being announced on September 24, Trump and his campaign team started a fundraising drive for an \\"Impeachment Defense Team\\". Forty-eight hours later, they had raised in excess of $13 million dollars and signed up 50,000 new donors. On September 27, Trump characterized the person who provided the whistleblower with information on the call as \\"close to a spy\\", adding: \\"you know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now.\\" On September 29, Trump requested to meet the whistleblower, saying that he and the American people \\"deserved\\" to meet them. He later said the White House was trying to learn the identity of the whistleblower. He also demanded that Adam Schiff be arrested and questioned \\"at the highest level\\" for fraud and treason. A letter from the whistleblower's lawyers, addressed to the director of national intelligence, said that the whistleblower was afraid for their safety. On November7 the whistleblower's lawyer sent a letter to the White House warning Trump to \\"cease and desist\\" calling for the public disclosure of the whistleblower's identity and \\"engaging in rhetoric and activity that places [the whistleblower] and their family in physical danger\\". The lawyer said the president would be legally and morally liable if anyone were to be \\"physically harmed as a result of his, or his surrogates', behavior\\". On October 1, Trump claimed that any attempt to remove him from office would result in a \\"Civil War-like fracture\\". He also called for Schiff to be arrested for treason, and later claimed that Nancy Pelosi was \\"every bit as guilty as Liddle' Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanours, and even Treason\\" before calling for both Schiff and Pelosi to be impeached themselves as they had \\"evilly 'Colluded. Vice President Mike Pence and U.S. delegation meet with President Zelensky in Warsaw on September 1, 2019 On October 3, after stating that the U.S. has \\"tremendous power\\" and \\"many options\\" in the trade war with China \\"if they don't do what we want\\", Trump was asked by a reporter on what he hoped Zelensky would do after his phone call. Trump responded by publicly urging both Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens. Later in the day, Vice President Mike Pence voiced his support of Trump's comments, saying: \\"I think the American people have a right to know if the vice president of the United States or his family profited from his position.\\" Pence said the activities of the Biden family were \\"worth looking into\\". Trump later claimed that when he called upon China to investigate the Bidens, his only interest was in thwarting corruption. Mitt Romney was critical of this, saying: \\"When the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China's investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that this is anything other than politically motivated.\\" Ukrainian President Zelensky with Kurt Volker and Rick Perry, May 2019 On October 4, Trump told congressional Republican leaders the only reason he had called Zelensky was at the urging of Energy Secretary Rick Perry, saying Perry wanted him to discuss a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant and that Trump had not even wanted to make the call. However, there is no mention of LNG in the publicly released summary of the conversation, and text messages exchanged among aides who were setting up the phone call made no mention of Perry, instead suggesting that Giuliani was the primary mover. Perry had been the administration's official representative at Zelensky's inauguration in May. During that trip; he pressured Zelensky to fire board members of Naftogaz, the national oil and gas company of Ukraine, and informed government and industry officials that the Trump administration wanted the entirety of Naftogaz's supervisory board replaced. Perry denied pressing for change at Naftogaz in a press conference on October 7, describing that as \\"a totally dreamed up story\\". On October 10, however, Perry was issued a subpoena by the House Intelligence Committee, the House Oversight Committee, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, partially concerning his interactions with Naftogaz. Trump's 2020 reelection campaign developed a campaign ad that repeated unsubstantiated claims about Biden, asserting that \\"when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him and their media lapdogs fall in line.\\" CNN refused to broadcast the ads because Trump's claims had already been debunked and for disparaging its journalists. = Ukraine = Volodymyr Zelensky with Donald Trump in New York City on September 25, 2019 On September 20, Roman Truba, head of the Ukraine State Bureau of Investigations, told The Daily Beast that his agency had not investigated the Biden–Burisma connection and there were no signs of illegality there. Anton Herashchenko, a senior advisor to the Ukraine interior minister, told The Daily Beast that Ukraine will open such an investigation if there is an official request, along with details of why an investigation is needed and what to look for. Trump's requests have come through unofficial representatives such as Giuliani. However, according to interviews and documents obtained by The New York Times, senior Ukrainian officials were aware that military aid was being withheld by the first week in August, and after initially having difficulty ascertaining what was holding up the aid, by September Trump's envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker was in negotiations with Zelensky's senior aide Andriy Yermak over the wording of the proposed public statement. Volker pressed for wording explicitly confirming investigations into Joe Biden's alleged pressure campaign for the removal of the Ukrainian prosecutor who was allegedly investigating Burisma, and into accusations that Ukraine had been involved in interference with the 2016 U.S. presidential election in favor of Hillary Clinton, while Yermak attempted to negotiate less explicit language. George Kent, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs, testified to the congressional impeachment inquiry that \\"Zelensky needed to go to a microphone and basically there needed to be three words in the message\\": investigations, Biden, 2016 (or synonymously, Hillary Clinton). Diplomat Bill Taylor testified that Trump insisted that the public declaration be made on CNN, and Times reporting found that Zelensky's staff finally capitulated to this demand, and arranged for him to appear on Fareed Zakaria's CNN program on September 13 to make the statement. The appearance was canceled after the Ukraine aid was released on September 11. Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko told a Ukrainian news outlet on September 21: \\"I know what the [phone] conversation was about and I think there was no pressure. This conversation was long, friendly, and it touched on many questions, sometimes requiring serious answers.\\" Prystaiko was also quoted as saying: \\"I want to say that we are an independent state, we have our secrets.\\" On September 22, Senator Chris Murphy said Zelensky told him he had no intention to get involved with an American election. In an interview released on September 24, Ukrainian diplomat and politician Valentyn Nalyvaichenko told The Daily Beast that Ukrainian authorities would be reopening corruption investigations into multiple individuals and organizations including, potentially, Burisma, Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, TV host Larry King, and former prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. King was suspected of receiving slush fund payments recorded in the \\"black ledger\\" that also named Manafort. Nalyvaichenko accused Lutsenko of having been in communication with associates of Trump \\"for vindictive purposes\\". During the joint press conference on September 25 with Trump for reporters gathered at the United Nations General Assembly, President Volodymyr Zelensky told reporters: \\"We had I think good phone call. It was normal. We spoke about many things. So, I think, and you read it, that nobody pushed me.\\" The next day, Zelensky said President Trump had not pressured anyone nor made any promises, and that the prosecutor ceneral Ruslan Riaboshapka would investigate all domestic cases without prejudice. On September 30, Zelensky made it clear that he was not going to interfere with the intra-American party confrontation. Subsequently, at an all-day press conference on October 10, Zelensky said he only learned about the blockage of the military aid after the July 25 phone call. \\"We didn't speak about this. There was no blackmail.\\" = European Union = During the conversation, Zelensky and Trump criticized German chancellor Angela Merkel and European Union for a lack of support toward Ukraine. Elmar Brok, special adviser on Ukraine for President Jean-Claude Juncker, refuted the criticism, pointing to the economic boost provided by the European Union through a free trade agreement. In addition, he claimed the U.S. has not signed a similar agreement with Ukraine. The conversation prompted Europeans to calculate the amount of aid given to Ukraine since 2014, and by approximate estimates, the EU and European financial institutions have provided assistance to more than $16 billion in grants and loans. In the overall ranking in 2016–2017, the European Union is the leader in terms of aid, the U.S. the second, and Germany is the third. However, Ukrainian media analyzed the data and found that from 2014, Germany provided aid of 1.4 billion euros: 500 million euros is a loan that will be repaid, 200 million euros is a share of Germany from European Union assistance, and the rest is really full-fledged assistance. Germany has stated that its attitude towards Ukraine has not changed. = Russia = Former Ukrainian prime minister Mykola Azarov expressed support for an investigation into Hunter Biden. Azarov fled to Russia in 2014 following the Euromaidan protests; he is currently in exile in Moscow, has called for a pro-Russian 'regime change' in Ukraine, is wanted for prosecution in Ukraine for abuse of power and embezzlement, and has set up a government in exile that is widely seen as a pro-Russian puppet. President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, \\"You have to admit, the publication of a full transcript of a conversation—be it by phone or face-to- face—is uncommon in interstate diplomatic practice. At least, uncommon until now.\\" Speaking at an energy conference in Moscow, Putin said: \\"I didn't see during the telephone conversation that Trump demanded some compromising information from Zelensky at all costs, and threatened that he would [otherwise] not provide assistance to Ukraine.\\" = Former U.S. officials = More than 300 former U.S. foreign policy and national security officials who had served under both Democratic and Republican administrations signed an open letter on September 27, supporting a congressional impeachment inquiry into Trump's conduct relating to Ukraine. The officials, who formerly served in the U.S. Intelligence Community, National Security Council, and departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security, wrote that Trump's actions raised \\"a profound national security concern\\" and that \\"President Trump appears to have leveraged the authority and resources of the highest office in the land to invite additional foreign interference into our democratic processes. If we fail to speak up—and act—now our foreign policy and national security will officially be on offer to those who can most effectively fulfill the President's personal prerogatives.\\" The American Foreign Service Association and American Academy of Diplomacy, representing members of the U.S. diplomatic corps, expressed alarm at Trump's disparagement of the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in his call with Zelensky. Ten former White House chiefs of staff, who served under both Republican and Democratic presidents described it as unprecedented for an incumbent president to \\"personally apply pressure to foreign powers to damage political opponents\\". When the ten were interviewed, \\"none recalled any circumstance under which the White House had solicited or accepted political help from other countries, and all said they would have considered the very idea out of bounds.\\" In an op-ed in the Washington Post, 17 former members of the Watergate scandal special prosecutor force wrote that \\"there exists compelling prima facie evidence that President Trump has committed impeachable offenses,\\" specifically serious and persistent abuses of power, and the Congress \\"should not allow any refusal by the president to cooperate in its process to frustrate the performance of its constitutional duties.\\" = American editorials and commentary = The Washington Post and New York Times editorial boards supported the impeachment inquiry against Trump arising from the scandal. The Post editorial board criticized the administration and its allies for defying congressional subpoenas and stonewalling the investigation, and called upon congressional Republicans to \\"have the moral courage\\" to recognize the Trump administration's Ukraine pressure campaign as corrupt and a quid pro quo. Another Washington Post editorial criticized the Trump administration for attacking William B. Taylor Jr., the acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, and other career civil servants who have testified before Congress, writing that it was \\"vile\\" to attack \\"honest and courageous public servants\\" in an attempt to discredit them. Some newspaper editorial boards called upon Trump to resign from office over the Ukraine scandal, including the editorial board of Hearst Connecticut Media, which owns eight daily newspapers in Connecticut. A St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial urged congressional Republicans to call for Trump's resignation. Pro-Trump media outlets and commentators, such as Jeanine Pirro, Mark Levin, and Rush Limbaugh, responded by defending Trump and promoting an alternative narrative of the Ukraine affair that omitted significant facts. Echoing Trump's own rhetoric, the president's defenders in the media often attacked the whistleblower, and characterized the investigation as not only a political attack against Trump, but also \\"a culture war\\" against his supporters. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace characterized the spin by Trump allies in the aftermath of the whistleblower complaint becoming public as \\"astonishing\\" and \\"deeply misleading\\". = Public opinion = In the days after the scandal arose, multiple polls showed a surge in support for an impeachment inquiry, or impeachment itself. = Resignations = The American special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, resigned one day after the complaint was released. The whistleblower complaint alleges Volker \\"sought to 'contain the damage' from Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's outreach to Ukraine's government about the Biden family\\". On October 10, Michael McKinley, a senior advisor to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, resigned over disappointment in Pompeo's lack of public support for those named in the scandal. = Internet communities = After the whistleblower complaint was publicized, users on pro-Trump Internet forums tried to identify its author. These attempts at \\"doxing\\" were marked by disorganized speculation, racism and misogyny. In October 2019, pro-Trump writer Paul Sperry published on the web what he asserted was the identity of the whistleblower. During ensuing days, Trump and his allies asserted major news outlets were covering for the whistleblower because they had declined to repeat the whistleblower's alleged identity in their reporting. However, the generally pro-Trump Fox News—including close Trump confidant Sean Hannity—also declined to repeat the alleged identity, on instructions from Fox News management. Trump supporters paid for Facebook advertisements to spread the purported name of the whistleblower. These ads were viewed by potentially \\"hundreds of thousands of users\\" before Facebook removed them. Aftermath =Impeachment and senate trial= President Trump was impeached by Congress on charges of abuse of power and obstructing Congress. The articles of impeachment were referred to the Senate, which held a trial over twenty days from January 16 to February 5, 2020. Trump was acquitted on both charges by the Republican-controlled Senate, with the vote split along party lines. Maine senator Susan Collins, who emerged as a key figure during the impeachment trial owing to her perceived willingness to break with her party, defended the acquittal as she believed Trump had learned from the trial and would not attempt to solicit foreign interference in future. =Resignations and firings of witnesses= Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor resigned from their positions in the State Department. Jennifer Williams left her position to take up a new post. Alexander Vindman was dismissed from his position in the White House following Trump's acquittal by the Senate. Vindman's twin brother Yevgeny--who was not involved in the case--was also dismissed. Both Vindman brothers were reported to have been physically escorted from the White House. Gordon Sondland was also recalled from his position as ambassador. The White House claimed that the dismissals were necessary, but Trump was criticized for seeking revenge against those who had testified against him. Trump was also reported to have labelled Williams and Alexander Vindman as \\"Never Trumpers\\". Trump suggested that the Pentagon should seek disciplinary action against Vindman, but the Army declined to investigate.https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/482638-trump-suggests- military-should-consider-additional-discipline- forhttps://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-hints-that-vindman-may-face- disciplinary-action-from-pentagonhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/pentagon-mum- trumps-suggestion-vindman-face-disciplinary- action/story?id=68939412https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/14/alexander- vindman-no-army-investigation-115286 John Rood, the top Pentagon policy advisor who, on July 25, 2019, warned Defense Secretary Mark Esper against withholding military aid to Ukraine, was forced to resign on February 19, 2020. In May 2019 he had certified to Congress that Ukraine was eligible for the aid.Pentagon Policy Chief in Ukraine-Aid Case Exits Under Pressure By Jennifer Jacobs and Jordan Fabian, Bloomberg News Politics, 19 Feb 2020 Subsequently, during a panel discussion held on February 11, 2020 at the Atlantic Council, the president's national security advisor, Robert C. O'Brien said that it was his decision to transfer both Vindman brothers back to the Army for re-assignment and denied that the move was ordered by Trump in retaliation for Vindman's testimony. \\"I can absolutely tell you that they were not retaliated against\\", O'Brien told the panel. O'Brien also disputed the move as being characterized as \\"fired\\" since both brothers remain on active duty. O'Brien noted that their transfer was part of a larger NSA staff reduction. It was later reported that the firings and dismissals were part of a wider purge of the Trump administration that targeted people who were perceived as not being loyal enough to Trump and his agenda,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/trump-disloyalty- turnover.html including intelligence officials who might be part of Trump's claims of a \\"deep state\\" conspiracy against him.https://www.axios.com/trump- memos-deep-state-white-house-ce5be95f-2418-433d-b036-2bf41c9700c3.html Michael Atkinson was fired from his position as Inspector General of the Intelligence Community in April 2020. The White House issued a statement that Trump had lost confidence in Atkinson's ability to perform his duties.https://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2020-04-04/donald-trump-fires-inspector- general-who-sparked-impeachment/12122012 The decision to fire Atkinson was criticized because his role as Inspector General was supposed to be independent and because Trump chose to fire him during the coronavirus pandemic, which led to claims that Trump had tried to use the pandemic to distract from Atkinson's firing. =Giuliani's activities in Ukraine= As the impeachment hearings and trial unfolded, Rudy Giuliani returned to Ukraine to conduct his own investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. This was widely criticized as a further attempt to undermine Biden's election campaign, for promoting widely debunked conspiracy theories about the Bidens, for Giuliani being a likely target for misinformation spread by Russian intelligence services, and because Giuliani is himself under investigation by American authorities. Giuliani went on to claim that he had found evidence that Barack Obama and Joe Biden had previously contacted Ukrainian officials looking to open an investigation into Paul Manafort, the chair of Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, who had lobbied to American lawmakers on behalf of former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych. In February 2020, Attorney General William Barr announced that the Justice Department would receive any information gathered by Giuliani.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national- security/barr-acknowledges-justice-dept-has-created-intake-process-to-vet- giulianis-information-on-bidens/2020/02/10/0fba553a-4c1e-11ea- bf44-f5043eb3918a_story.htmlhttps://www.npr.org/2020/02/10/804518735/barr- door-is-open-to-giuliani-tips-on-ukraine-though-they-d-be- scrutinizedhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/us/politics/justice-department- giuliani-bidens-ukraine.html Barr had previously announced that all investigations into foreign donations and interference into the 2020 presidential elections would require his personal approval. During the impeachment process, Trump denied having sent Giuliani to Ukraine, but in an interview that aired on February 13, 2020, he reversed his prior denials and openly admitted sending Giuliani to Ukraine, praising him as a \\"crime fighter\\" and \\"the best prosecutor.\\" =Place in the Russia investigation counter- narrative= In February 2020, United States attorney John Durham was appointed to lead an investigation into the origins of the Mueller inquiry. It was reported that the investigation was focusing on former CIA director and Trump critic John Brennan and whether he had mishandled evidence during the early stages of the inquiry into Russian meddling in the 2016 elections. Mick Mulvaney linked Durham's investigation to the Ukraine scandal, stating that Durham had sought help from Ukraine and interviewed Ukrainian citizens. The Durham inquiry has been described as an \\"inquiry into its own Russia investigation\\". and \\"investigating the investigators\\" of the Russian interference.  Conspiracy theories  Trump and his allies had since 2017 promoted a conspiracy theory that Ukraine, rather than Russia, had interfered with the 2016 election, which American intelligence believes has been promoted by Russia in order to frame Ukraine. Some speculate Maria Zakharova at Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was the source of this campaign. The conspiracy theory included allegations that Democrats, CrowdStrike and the FBI had conspired to frame Russia in the 2016 hacking of a Democratic National Committee server. Trump has repeatedly insisted without evidence that an unnamed Ukrainian oligarch was behind the conspiracy to frame Russia and that Ukraine is in possession of the DNC server. Shortly before Trump took office, top American intelligence officials briefed him on their evidence—including from their hacking of Russian intelligence networks and information provided by a high-level Kremlin mole—that Russia was behind the hacking and other election interference, on the personal orders and orchestration of Vladimir Putin. In December 2019, the Trump-appointed FBI director Christopher Wray stated, \\"we have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election,\\" adding, \\"there's all kinds of people saying all kinds of things out there. I think it's important for the American people to be thoughtful consumers of information and to think about the sources of it and to think about the support and predication for what they hear.\\" = CrowdStrike = George Stephanopoulos described the details of the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory as \\"both convoluted and false\\". During the July 25, 2019, phone call between Trump and Zelensky, Trump referred to a far-right conspiracy theory pushed by internet trolls, right-wing blogs, and right-wing news websites. This conspiracy theory concerns CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity and internet security firm that first investigated the 2015–2016 hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) network and determined that Russian military intelligence (GRU) was behind these cyber attacks. Tom Bossert, Trump's former homeland security advisor, said in an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that Trump was repeatedly warned by his staff that the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory was \\"completely debunked\\". Bossert blamed Giuliani for Trump's fixation upon the conspiracy theory. The overarching theme of the CrowdStrike conspiracy theory is that the DNC fabricated evidence to implicate Russia in the cyber attacks. CrowdStrike's co-founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a naturalized American citizen born in the Soviet Union. According to the hoax, Alperovitch is a Ukrainian who was ordered by the DNC to discredit Russia for the election interference, and he was personally motivated to get even with Vladimir Putin. Also, according to the theory, CrowdStrike is owned by a rich Ukrainian and the actual server involved in the cyber attack is in Ukraine. CrowdStrike is actually a publicly traded company headquartered in California that the National Republican Congressional Committee has also hired for cyber security services. \\"The server\\" is actually 140 servers, decommissioned and located in the United States. The theory additionally says FBI agents were not allowed to examine the server because such action would expose the DNC plot, although in fact—and as documented in the Mueller Report—system images and traffic logs of the DNC servers were provided to the FBI. This conspiracy theory originated from a \\"GRU persona, 'Guccifer 2.0', created to cast doubt on Russia's culpability in the DNC [intrusion]\\". = Actions of first whistleblower = Various right-wing commentators speculated the whistleblower had help from others, perhaps constituting a coordinated conspiracy. Speculation centered around Adam Schiff, the press, Fusion GPS, Media Matters, a team of lawyers or a research firm, and the intelligence community in general. After the whistleblower had informed the CIA's general counsel of his concerns, he grew troubled by \\"how that initial avenue for airing his allegations through the CIA was unfolding\\", according to The New York Times. He then contacted an aide for the House Intelligence Committee and provided a vague statement. The aide then followed standard procedure and advised the whistleblower to find a lawyer and file a complaint with the Intelligence Community inspector Ggeneral (IC IG). Neither Rep. Schiff nor the other members of the Committee saw the complaint until the night before they released it publicly, and the Committee was not involved in writing the complaint. Schiff and the Committee had no role in helping the whistleblower select an attorney. According to Mark S. Zaid, a member of the whistleblower's pro bono legal team: \\"The whistleblower took the advice to find an attorney and did what most people do, they asked around to trusted friends as to who they should contact. Andrew [Bakaj]'s name was provided and he was retained. Exactly how it happens every day.\\" Andrew P. Bakaj is the Lead Attorney representing the whistleblower. During a news conference on October 2, Trump claimed that the New York Times article proved Schiff had helped write the whistleblower complaint, prompting one of the reporters who wrote the story to reply on Twitter that their story said no such thing and that Schiff had not even known the whistleblower's identity. = Whistleblower rules and hearsay = In late September, Trump tweeted a conspiracy theory that whistleblower rules were changed before the whistleblower complaint was submitted. Senator Lindsey Graham, and Trump's lawyers Jay Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani made similar claims. Trump's claim was based on an article from The Federalist which incorrectly stated that the IC IG \\"secretly eliminated a requirement that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings\\", by revising their complaint form sometime between May 2018 and August 2019, removing a section from the old form containing the sentence: \\"If you think wrongdoing took place, but can provide nothing more than secondhand or unsubstantiated assertions, IC IG will not be able to process the complaint or information for submission as an ICWPA.\\" The Federalist article failed to mention that the old form had checkboxes where the whistleblower could indicate that their information was \\"direct\\" or from either \\"other employees\\" or other indirect sources. The IC IG responded the whistleblower's complaint was submitted with the old form (before the forms changed), and that the whistleblower's complaint was based on both \\"direct knowledge of certain alleged conduct\\" and knowledge from other employees. The IC IG also said the old form had been under review, and that \\"in response to recent press inquiries regarding the instant whistleblower complaint\\", the form was changed because \\"certain language in those forms and, more specifically, the informational materials accompanying the forms, could be read—incorrectly—as suggesting that whistleblowers must possess first-hand information in order to file an urgent concern complaint\\". The IC IG also said that by law a complainant is not required to have \\"first-hand information\\" themselves, and that their office \\"cannot add conditions to the filing of an urgent concern that do not exist in law\\". The \\"rules\\" for whistleblowing arise from Intelligence Community Directive 120, last updated in 2016. The directive states that the requirement for a complaint is to be one which the whistleblower \\"reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule or regulation\\". The burden of obtaining and evaluating first-hand knowledge for credibility is placed on the IC IG, who has 14 days to conduct an investigation to do so. In this case, the preliminary review done by the IC IG did find more information to support the allegations as credible. Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project, a non-profit watchdog organization, said only around 10% of all credible whistleblower complaints have firsthand information. Republican senator Chuck Grassley, a prominent author and advocate of whistleblower laws, spoke out against the conspiracy theory, saying the whistleblower appeared to have acted in accordance with the law and deserved to be heard. = George Soros = In late-September television appearances, Giuliani asserted without offering any evidence that George Soros, a frequent subject of conservative conspiracy theories, was running an anti-Trump scheme in Ukraine while Biden was protecting Soros from prosecution there. Lawyers Joseph diGenova and Victoria Toensing appeared as guests on The Sean Hannity Show to promote the conspiracy theory that Soros funded the whistleblower. They cited the whistleblower's footnote references to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, an organization that has received grants from Soros' Open Society Foundations among multiple other funding sources. Soros was also invoked, again without evidence, by the media organization Breitbart News. Discredited allegations against Soros were also part of a \\"packet of propaganda and disinformation\\" that had been circulating within the State Department since May 2019, until being revealed to Congress on October 2.

Minott was born in Concord, Massachusetts and probably apprenticed about 1745 to William Homes in Boston. He worked from 1753-1803 as a silversmith in the city, during which time he was a partner from 1765-1769 with Josiah Austin in Charlestown as MINOTT & AUSTIN, and briefly circa 1770 with William Simpkins in Boston as MINOTT & SIMPKINS. On October 1, 1772, in The Boston Weekly News-Letter, he advertised assorted groceries and pottery \\"at his Shop opposite William's Court, Cornhill\\", and was \\"the Goldsmiths Business in all its Branches as usual at his other Shop Northward of the Draw Bridge.\\" His wares included tea, delft, silver-mounted swords, coral beads, plate and jewelry. He was listed in city directories starting in 1789 as \\"Minot Samuel, goldsmith, and importer of plated and jewellery-ware, Ann- street\\", and was still on Ann Street in 1796, but also had a house on Court Street. Minot married Elizabeth Davis on October 7, 1762. His only known apprentice was Samuel Bartlett. In 1776, he was arrested as a Tory by order of the Common Council, but apparently released as his work and residence continued in Boston. His estate was inventoried October 17, 1803.

Personal life He was born in Mohill, County Leitrim, on December 31, 1808, and arrived in America in 1833. His brother, John O'Beirne, was also a priest in Boston. Patrick died on March 20, 1883, and was buried next to his brother John on the grounds of St. Joseph's church in Roxbury. Ministry O'Beirne was ordained a priest in 1835 at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston by Bishop Benedict Fenwick. Over his career he served in Vermont, Rhode Island, and Maine, which were then parts of the Diocese of Boston. Immediately after his ordination, he spent some time at the cathedral before being transferred to St. Mary's in the North End and then to Burlington, Vermont. From 1841 to 1843, he served at what would later become the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception in Portland, Maine. O'Beirne then was assigned to Roxbury's St. Patrick's parish, in Boston. As pastor of St. Patrick's, he established several new churches, including St. Joseph's, in Roxbury, and St. Thomas Aquinas in Jamaica Plain. He served as the first pastor of St. Joseph's and remained there until his death in 1883. At the suggestion of the religious sisters who ran the school, He also built a school house for the parish on the grounds of Notre Dame Academy in Roxbury. In 1858, he was the principal celebrant at the solemn high Mass dedicating Immaculate Conception Church in Salem, Massachusetts. Ordained for less than a decade, the 33-year-old O'Beirne had charge of the Catholics in Dedham, Norwood, Randolph, Holliston, Walpole, and Needham, as well as Roxbury. Prior to his pastorate at St. Joseph's, O'Beirne had charge of the parish and mission in Quincy, Massachusetts, in West Quincy, St. Mary's 1843–45. While there, he purchased the land for what would become St. Mary's Church in Randolph. He also served in St. Mary's early days. Prior to the church being built, he would occasionally come out to say Mass for the Catholics of that community. He was also briefly pastor of St. Rose of Lima in Chelsea, Massachusetts and served at St. John the Evangelist in Hopkington, Massachusetts, and St. Mary's in Holliston, Massachusetts. O'Beirne served on the Archbishop's Council and opened the Toll Gate Cemetery on Hyde Park Avenue. =Dispute at St. Mary's= O'Beirne served as co-pastor of St. Mary's Church in the North End with Fr. Thomas J. O’Flaherty beginning in 1840. The parish, made up largely of Irish immigrants, soon split into two camps with each supporting one of the two priests. The differences were partly political and partly about church governance. By January 1842 the congregation was so divided that Bishop Fenwick was worried that violence may erupt and so visited on January 9, 1842, to try to restore the peace. During Mass, he preached an hour long sermon on obedience and warned that those who attended mass meetings of protest could be excommunicated. Just a few days later, on January 13, 1842, a large group of O'Flaherty supporters gathered. When a member of the O'Beirne camp disrupted the meeting's opening address, a \\"mob situation\\" arose. Police had to be called in to restore order. In response, Fenwick wrote to parishioners and invited them to attend another meeting on January 16, 1842. Parishioners from other parishes attended the meeting, disrupting it, and cutting it short to avoid another mob break out. Fenwick then ordered the two priests to publicly reconcile on January 23, 1842. Not long after, O'Beirne requested a transfer to a different parish and was sent to Providence, Rhode Island, which was then part of the Boston Diocese. His supporters at St. Mary's were not happy, however, and 400 of them signed a petition calling for his return. When Fenwick refused, a riot broke out on February 20, 1842, during a vespers service O'Flaherty was presiding over. Parishioners were arrested, and Fenwick placed the parish under an interdict that shuttered it for two weeks. In Providence, O'Beirnes new parishioners were not happy with him and told Fenwick so in insulting terms that the bishop would call \\"insolent\\" and \\"anti-Catholic\\". Still seeking a solution, Fenwick reassigned all the priests in the troubled parishes in March. O'Beirne moved again, this time to Taunton, Massachusetts. =Dedham= By 1846, the Catholic community in Dedham, Massachusetts, was well established enough that the town became part of the mission of St. Joseph's Church. The flood of Irish immigrants escaping the Great Famine necessitated holding Mass in the Temperance Hall, often O’Beirne. Mass was also occasionally celebrated in the Crystal Palace on Washington Street. Worshipers came from Dedham, South Dedham, West Dedham, and West Roxbury. While at St. Joseph's, he had charge of the mission in Dedham, Massachusetts, and he established what is today St. Mary's Church there. In 1856 the cornerstone was laid and, in 1857, the first St. Mary's Church was completed on Washington Street between Spruce and Marion Streets. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 1857, Father O’Beirne said Mass for the first time in the new 600 person church. Reading from the 20th chapter of John's Gospel, O'Beirne proclaimed the news of Jesus' empty tomb. Though it was still part of the Roxbury Parish, O'Beirne or one of his assistants would travel to Dedham each Sunday to say mass. In April 1863 he purchased the Unitarian meetinghouse in South Dedham, today the parish of St. Catherine's in Norwood. Prior to this, he would say mass in the homes of South Dedham parishioners. O'Beirne remained pastor of St. Mary's until 1866, when Fr. John P. Brennan took over.

Sharman Crawford was also a feminist who did not hesitate to call out where she saw sexist whether in the cultures through which she travelled or in her own. Sharman Crawford was a member of the National Society for Women's Suffrage as a central committee member. She researched into the subject of sentences and actions taken against men who beat their wives and used the results to write the article Maltreatment of Wives for the Westminster Review 139 in 1893. She was also an proponent of the Rational Dress Society. Mabel Sharman Crawford died 14 February 1912 in Middlesex, England.

It only made three flights before being grounded as dangerous. Design and development The KhAI-4 was the Kharkov Institute's first tailless design, making its first flight two years before the Kharkov KhAI-3. It was an all-wood machine. It was rather similar in layout to the powered version of the Lippisch Delta 1, first flown three years earlier in 1931, and had similar dimensions but a much more powerful engine. Its low-mounted wing was tetragonal in plan, with sweep (15°) only on the leading edges. Wing tip fins, which had a blunted triangular profile, carried slightly more rounded rudders. Ailerons occupied the outer 65% of each wing, with the rest filled with an elevon. The controls were essentially conventional, with rudder pedals and a wheel for the ailerons which, when pushed or pulled moved the elevons together to change pitch. Its fuselage was short but deep, with an enclosed cabin over the leading edge holding two seats in tandem. A Shvetsov M-11 radial engine, working in pusher configuration, was mounted high on the rear fuselage with its five cylinders exposed for cooling. Under the engine the fuselage was cut away. The KhAI-4 had a conventional fixed undercarriage, though the need for propeller ground clearance required a long tailwheel leg, producing a low ground angle of attack. Operational history The first flight was piloted by B.N. Kudrin, who found insufficient elevon authority to lift the nose for take-off until he reached , the design maximum airspeed. Pitch instability dominated the rest of the flight, though he landed successfully. Two more flights were made before the KhAI-4 was grounded as dangerous.

It is the administrative center of the municipality and is the only settlement included in it.  Geography  Map of Sunzhensky District, Chechnya. Assinovskaya is in the south The village of Assinovskaya is located on the left bank of the Assa River (hence the name). It is located south of the village of Sernovodskoye and west of the city of Grozny. The nearest settlements to Assinovskaya are Sernovodskoye in the north, Novy Sharoy in the east, Achkhoy-Martan in the south-east, Bamut in the south, and Berd-Yurt and Nesterovskaya in the west.  History  The village of Assinovskaya was founded in 1847 on the land of the Karabulak aul of Akh-Borzoy. According to official maps at the time, the aul and the village existed simultaneously, so on the map of the for 1871, there are the village of Assinskaya and the aul of Akhbarzoy, which is located on the opposite (right) bank of the Assa river, with Assinovskaya on the left, at the mouth of the Zheltukha stream. In the summer of 1992, the church in the village was attacked. About 30 attackers broke religious items, shot at the icons and images with machine guns, and raided the altar. In 1997, the new abbot of the church was killed in another attack, and the walls of the church were burned. In 2013, the rebuilding of the church was finally completed, and the building was reopened. In 1994, the residents of the village wrote a letter to the former President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin, with a plea for help, and explaining the facts of robbery, kidnapping and murder against ethnic Russian residents of the village. On 28 March 1999 and 8 April 1999, two Orthodox priests in the village were kidnapped. Peter Sukhonosov, the Archpriest, was killed, and priest Sergey Potapov was released. In 2003, the village of Assinovskaya, together with Sernovodskoye, were transferred to Chechnya.

Rupp (born 1980) is the Thomas Lord Associate Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her work considers solid-state materials for energy and information devices, including batteries, neuromorphic memory and computing logic.  Early life and education  Rupp was born in Germany in 1980. Her mother was a language teacher, her father was a physicist and her aunt an active feminist. She played piano as a child and struggled to choose between pursuing physics or music. She eventually studied mineralogy and crystallography at the University of Vienna. Her undergraduate efforts were recognised by the Austrian Chemical Society, who presented her with their prize for her diploma thesis. She earned her doctoral degree at ETH Zurich. She was appointed as a group leader there in 2007, where she studied crystallisation kinetics in solid state ionic conductors and solid-oxide fuel cells. She was awarded the ETH Zurich medal for PhD excellence. In 2011 she joined the National Institute for Materials Science in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, where she learned how to make oxide memristors and protonic fuel cells. She left after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. In 2012 Rupp joined Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she worked briefly as a senior scientist, and specialised in solid-oxide fuel cells and started to investigate resistive switching. She worked with Harry Tuller and Bilge Yildiz. Rupp returned to ETH Zurich and worked there until 2016. She was awarded a Swiss National Science Foundation starting grant on materials functionalisation.  Research and career  In 2012 Rupp was awarded a Swiss National Science Foundation Professorship on resistance switching memories. Here she launched and directed the electrochemical materials group. The group developed lithium batteries and solid-state thin film batteries for portable electronics, as well as investigating structure- property relationships in these energy materials including perovskites. She has focussed on solar to fuel materials, which use solar-powered thermochemical water and carbon dioxide splitting. She has studied solid oxide fuel cells that can be incorporated onto a chip, and include .a free-standing membrane that separates a fuel from an air supply. Her contributions have been into electrochemomechanics; the interactions of the ionic charge transport, oxygen non-stoichiometry and membrane strain. She created a perovskite-based memristor in 2015, with three stable resistive states that can encode data as a 0, 1 or 2. In 2016 Rupp demonstrated a fast charging solid lithium-ion battery that did not involve liquids or gels. This can overcome problems of batteries igniting, due to thermal runaway, when the lithium makes contact with air. The fast charging occurs because there is greater contact between the anode and the electrolyte than in conventional batteries. She moved back to Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2016, where she has worked on lithium ceramic electrolyte conductors for safe and efficient batteries. At MIT Rupp works on solid-state materials for energy devices including solar cells and solar-to-synthetic fuel conversion. She is also interested in neuromorphic memories and computing logic. She has delivered plenary talks at the Royal Society and Gordon Research Conference. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2012 Elected to the European Academy of Science for Chemistry *2012 Kepler Prize * 2014 ETH Zurich Spark Award * 2015 World Economic Forum Top 40 international scientist under the age of 40 * 2015 Elected to the Swiss CO2 Energy Technology-funding board * 2017 Volkswagen Science Awards * 2018 Merck Group Displaying Future Awards Rupp is Associate Editor of the Journal of Materials Chemistry A.

Samuel Carte (21 October 1652 – 16 April 1740) was an English antiquarian and clergyman of the Church of England. After attending Magdalen College, Oxford, he held many ecclesiastical positions in his adult life, publishing two sermons. He was an active local antiquarian researcher, assisting several fellow antiquarians in their histories of Leicestershire, and publishing several articles and one book on such subjects. Biography Samuel Carte was born on 21 October 1652 in Coventry, Warwickshire, to the local clothier, Thomas Carte. Here, he was educated at the local free school, after which he matriculated from Magdalen College, Oxford University on 10 June 1669, at the age of 17. He graduated with a BA in 1673 and MA in 1675. He received deacon's orders from the Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry, Thomas Wood, at Eccleshall on 21 September 1673. Following by being ordained a priest by the Bishop of London, Henry Compton, on 10 June 1677. Carte's first ecclesiastical position was as a curate of Crick, Northamptonshire, appointed on 26 March 1678. On 29 September 1682, he was made a prebendary of Lichfield Cathedral, a position he held until shortly before his death. From 26 March 1684 to 2 February 1693, Carte was the vicar of Clifton-upon-Dunsmore, Warwickshire. In 1691, Carte returned to Coventry, where he served as the master of the local free school. He returned to his career as a clergyman, working as vicar of Dunchurch from 2 July 1697 to 8 June 1699. On 7 January 1699, he was appointed both as the Preacher throughout the diocese of Lincoln, and the rector of Eastwell, Leicestershire, the latter position he held up until his death. In 1700, he was made lecturer and sequestrator at Leicester Cathedral, where, on 21 October 1712, he was made vicar, holding the office until the year of his death. Independent of these offices, Carte engaged in much theological and antiquarian work. As a clergyman, two of his sermons were published: A Dissuasive from Murmuring: Being a Sermon on 1 Cor. X. 10. (1694) and The Cure of Self-Conceit: A Sermon Preach'd at St. Martin's in Leicester on Sunday, May 13. 1705 (1705). In the 1720s, he also engaged in a lengthy argument with John Jackson, a controversial unitarian cleric of Leicester Cathedral, concerning the validity of baptism by immersion and the Trinity. Contemporary antiquaries, including Browne Willis (for his 1718-19 Mitred Abbots) and John Throsby (for his 1791 History and Antiquities of Leicester), consulted Carte over the history of Leicestershire. After Carte's death, John Nichols used his work extensively for his History of Leicestershire (1795-1811). Carte's most important publication was antiquarian in nature: Tabula Chronologica Archiepiscopatuum et Episcopatuum in Anglia et Wallia [Chronological table of Archbishoprics and Bishoprics in England and Wales] (1714), a compilation of lists on the descent of the offices of archbishops and bishops. Carte also had a letter to Humfrey Wanley published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Carte married Anne, together having thirteen children between 1686 and 1704, with Anne predeceasing Carte at a young age. Carte died in Leicester on 16 April 1740, and was buried at Leicester Cathedral next to his wife and two of his children. His will, written on 19 January 1736, put most of his possessions in the hands of his eldest son, Thomas Carte.

The Grenadier, which is strongly reminiscent of the old Land Rover Defender, has boxy bodywork, a steel ladder chassis, beam axles with long-travel progressive-rate coil spring suspension (front and rear), and is to be powered by BMW six-cylinder engines. History Ineos Grenadier, rear Ratcliffe came up with the idea of building a replacement of his Land Rover Defender and approached Jaguar Land Rover to buy the tooling to continue production after the original model ceased at Solihull after 67 years in January 2016. Subsequently, Ratcliffe decided to then initiate a project to design and build a similar vehicle under the codename Projekt Grenadier. The vehicle is named after Ratcliffe’s favourite pub, the Grenadier, in Belgravia, London, where the initial idea was considered, and where a promotional presentation was given.

She married the rich Parisian investor Alexandre Sarrasin de Maraise in 1767. Her spouse was the business partner of the pioneer industrialist Christophe- Philippe Oberkampf, founder of the royal manufacture of printed cotton in France. Her husband lacked knowledge of business details and allowed her to represent his interests in the business, and with his permission, she managed the company in collaboration with Oberkampf. This was an epoch when married women where legally minors under the guardianship of their husbands, but she was allowed to do so because of her husband's support. This made Marie- Catherine de Maraise uncommon in her position of a married businesswoman in large business enterprise. She is described as a talented woman with a keen business sense. She was essentially active as the company's accountant, responsible for its economy and for managing its contacts with authorities and business contacts, acting as the public face of the company, particularly as Oberkampf was a Protestant which made it impossible for him to be seen in certain ceremonial situations in public. With her sense of economy, she reportedly played an important part in making the firm the second most successful in France, and she acquired many valuable business contacts through her social life, among them Suzanne Curchod. It is noted that she found out that France was going to participate in the American Revolutionary War beforehand through her contacts and used the information to try to secure an army contract for the company. In 1789, Oberkampf ended the companionship with her husband, which automatically also ended her involvement in the firm.

The winner of the tournament was presented with a championship belt instead of a trophy, to match the Universal Championship tournament winners. Tournament background In 2009 the Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) held their first ever Universal Championship tournament featuring 16 champions from the promotion's male division. The tournament became an annually recurring tournament from that point on.

Family  Born Margaret Vincentia on 18 June 1891 in Marylebone, London, to politician father John Annan Bryce and mother Violet L'Estrange. Bryce was variously known as Marjery, Marjorie or Marjery Vincentia and Marjorie Annan. She had two brothers and a sister three years younger, Rosalind L'Estrange, known as 'Tiny'. One brother, Nigel, died at the age of nineteen. Her other brother Roland, was later to be one of the commissioners in 1922 to lay out the borders for Yugoslavia. Her father was Liberal MP for the Inverness Burghs, voted against the Conciliation Bill which was to give some women the franchise and wrote letters to the press against women's suffrage. Her mother, Violet held the opposite view and was a cousin to Countess Markievicz and Eva Gore- Booth, both activists for women's rights. Bryce remained single.  Role in Women's Suffrage movement  Bryce joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) parade at the age of nineteen was portraying 'the perfect woman' riding on a white horse dressed in full armour with a banner in the style of Joan of Arc, leading the forty thousand strong Women's Procession on 17 June 1911, before George V's Coronation. Her sister Rosalind \\"Tiny\\" Bryce was dressed as a page and led the horse's bridle. This demonstration was to encourage support of the proposed Conciliation Bill, which would have given the franchise to women who owned property. The image of Saint Joan was seen to represent 'the militant women's ideal....in every act of hers they recognize the same spirit as that which strengthens them to risk their liberty and endure torture for the sake of freedom'. And the leaders of WSPU, Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and Mabel Tuke led the parade, with groups of women's trades and professions, or, like Bryce, dressed as famous women from the past. Christabel in particular felt the image of Joan of Arc included the willingness to undertake physical hardship and emphasised the martial (masculine) qualities as an image of fighting for a cause of right. This was summed up a ' the loveliness of simplicity, purity, courage and militancy' which Bryce was acting in this parade and was an image used by WSPU as a symbol. suffragette procession 1911 The Museum of London has the original copyright image of Bryce as Joan of Arc cited in many of the references above. In other suffragette parades, Joan of Arc was also portrayed by Elsie Howey.  Acting career  Bryce played the London stage for example, in the role of Nina Zarechnaya in The Seagull (1919), appeared in The Cloud that Lifted (1932) after performing in Other Gates in the Grafton Theatre, London in 1931, and was the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland (in 1938 and again in1947). Her entry in 1939 'The Spotlight' theatrical casting directory describes her as a straight, comedy or character performer. Bryce was later known for her roles in Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers (1949), appearing in BBC Sunday-Night Theatre (1950s) and appeared in a BBC series The Bell Family (1951 ).

Life  Rieder was born in Vienna, Austria, the daughter of Hilda and Walter Rieder. She studied political science and ethnology at the University of Vienna. Her later career would see her travel to California, Brazil and throughout Europe. From 1976 to 1984 she worked as a journalist and translator in Berkeley, California. She also found work in San Francisco with a media and translation collective. There she helped to produce Newsfront International, and Connexions, an international feminist quarterly. From 1984 to 1986 she was journalist and interpreter in São Paulo,Brazil. Rieder was editor-at-large for Cleis Press in San Francisco from 1987 to 1994. One of the notable books that she edited in her time there was Aids: The Women (1988), the first book to document the work of women in the early years of the Aids crisis and the solidarity between the lesbian and gay communities in this period. The book was published in the US, Europe and China. In 1994 she published \\"Wer mit wem?\\" Berühmte Frauen, ihre Freundinnen, Liebhaberinnen und Lebensgefährtinnen (in translation: Who with whom? Famous women, their friends, lovers and partners), the first of her several studies of the lives of lesbians. In 2000, Rieder and Diana Voigt completed the biography of Margarethe Trautenegg-Csonka (1900-1999), Sigmund Freud's lesbian patient, who they codenamed as \\"Sidonie C.\\", after interviewing her at length towards the end of her life. It was published in four languages and reissued in 2012. Rieder contributed to many anthologies and researched the lives of lesbians in Vienna during and after the second world war. In 2001 she was co-editor of a catalogue for an exhibition project called The Different View, about lesbian and gay life in Austria, and in 2005 was co-curator of (in translation) Secret Life: About gay men and lesbians in 20th-century Vienna. Rieder joined the women's movement in Brazil, worked on rainwater-harvesting projects and was a proactive supporter of Women on Waves, an international organisation using a Dutch ship to provide abortion and contraception services in countries where these are difficult to obtain or illegal. Most recently she was supporting work with refugees from Syria in Vienna, especially those from the LGBT communities.  Publications  * \\"Wer mit wem?\\" Hundert Jahre lesbische Liebe.

The station was owned and operated by Sound and Print United and operated from 1976 to 1987; it was perpetually challenged by poor community support for the station, even after it moved its studio facilities to Rocky Mount in the mid-1980s. History Sound and Print United, Inc., applied for a new noncommercial radio station in Warrenton on December 14, 1973, despite none of its principals having any experience in radio. The call letters WMIP were assigned to the station originally, but before going on air, they were changed to WVSP, for \\"Voices Serving People\\". The station initially broadcast with 50,000 watts from its tower halfway between Warrenton and Rocky Mount, near Essex, North Carolina; the station's first studios were located on the second floor of a building previously used by two doctors, on Franklin Street in downtown Warrenton, with Sound and Print's print shop occupying the first floor; 75 percent of the original equipment cost was covered by a federal grant. WVSP began broadcasting on August 26, 1976. It was an NPR member station and aired All Things Considered along with its own local news and community programming and jazz music. In 1980, the station was granted a power increase to 100,000 watts. Throughout its decade on the air, WVSP struggled with a chronic shortage of community support. The station was unusual among its noncommercial peers in the fact that it served a mostly rural region; additionally, most of the station's management was black. As early as 1977, the station was suffering from a variety of financial and technical problems, as stated in its own mailings. As a result, and in order to move closer to the center of its listening audience, the station embarked in September 1983 on a campaign to relocate its studios from Warrenton to Rocky Mount, where it hoped to obtain a wider volunteer base and increased community and corporate support. The move was in part funded by a $25,000 challenge grant from the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation of Winston-Salem that required WVSP to raise the remaining $155,000. Abbott Laboratories, which owns a facility in Rocky Mount, donated $5,000 in support of the campaign, as did Belk Tyler; Hardee's made a $20,000 contribution. However, the station expressed disappointment at the poor response to raise the remainder of the funds needed to cover moving expenses. In July 1984, the station took an option to purchase the Hodgin Building at 230 Tarboro Street in Rocky Mount. However, the move was not completed until November 1985 owing to slow fundraising and building renovations. The move to Rocky Mount would not be enough to save WVSP. At NPR's 1986 public meeting, the national organization voted to disconnect WVSP for not paying its distribution/interconnection fees. On December 15, the station temporarily ceased operations for technical and financial reasons, not returning until January 15, 1987. By that fall, however, the station had ceased operations for good, and it was being reported that creditors were seeking a person connected with WVSP's operations. North Carolina Wesleyan College became involved in efforts to keep WVSP afloat, but when the station ultimately failed, Wesleyan and people previously associated with Sound and Print United applied to build a new public radio station licensed to Rocky Mount; this station, WESQ, went on air in April 1992 and was sold by the college to a local non-profit group in 1995, becoming WRQM, which remains on air.

Political career Francischini was elected with about 36,000 votes to the Legislative Assembly of Paraná in 2014, despite the fact that he had no political experience and had just graduated from university. In the 2018 Brazilian general election, Francischini and his father switched roles, with Felipe running for his father's seat in the national legislature and Fernando running for his son's seat in the lower legislature. Reasons for the surprise move were mused by the media, ranging from Fernando Francischini wanting to spend more time with his other son who has autism, or Filipe's political ambitions, or the fact that Fernando wants to eventually run for mayor of Curitiba.

Biography  VanDyke was born on December 12, 1972 in Midland, Texas. The following year, his family moved to Bozeman, Montana. VanDyke earned his Bachelor of Science, with highest honors, from Montana State University in 1997 and a Master of Arts in 2000. He received his Juris Doctor, magna cum laude, from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating from law school in 2005, VanDyke served as a law clerk to Judge Janice Rogers Brown of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. He then worked in private practice at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher. While in private practice, VanDyke performed pro bono legal work for groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Free Market Foundation, and the Alliance Defending Freedom. In 2010, VanDyke filed an amicus brief in Christian Legal Society v. Martinez on behalf of Gays and Lesbians for Individual Liberty in which he argued that a college student group had a First Amendment right to exclude from membership students whose sexual conduct violated the group's stated beliefs. From 2012–2013, VanDyke was an Assistant Solicitor General of Texas. He served as Solicitor General of Montana from 2013–2014, when he resigned, citing strain in the workplace. As Solicitor General of Montana, he submitted numerous amicus curiae briefs filed in other states. He recommended signing on to other states' challenges to state and federal gun laws, co-wrote a brief supporting an Arizona law prohibiting abortions after 20 weeks, and recommended that Montana file a brief in a New Mexico case involving a photographer who refused to photograph a lesbian commitment ceremony. VanDyke later ran unsuccessfully for the Montana Supreme Court. He became Solicitor General of Nevada under Attorney General Adam Laxalt in 2015, where he served until 2019 when he became a deputy Assistant Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice Environment and Natural Resources Division. Since graduating law school, VanDyke has been a member of the Federalist Society.  Federal judicial service  On September 20, 2019, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate VanDyke to serve as a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Nevada Senators Jacky Rosen and Catherine Cortez Masto, both Democrats, announced their opposition in the nomination. The nomination was to the seat being vacated by Judge Jay Bybee, who previously announced his intention to take senior status on December 31, 2019. Six retired justices of the Montana Supreme Court publicly opposed VanDyke’s nomination. VanDyke received a \\"not qualified\\" rating from the American Bar Association. ABA evaluators conducted 60 anonymous interviews with lawyers, judges, and others who had worked with VanDyke. In unusually personal terms, the ABA published a scathing critique of VanDyke in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee; that letter asserted that interviewees described VanDyke as \\"'arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice'\\" of law. The ABA added that \\"'There was a theme that the nominee lacks humility, has an 'entitlement' temperament, does not have an open mind, and does not always have a commitment to being candid and truthful'\\". The ABA also raised \\"concerns about whether Mr. VanDyke would be fair to persons who are gay, lesbian, or otherwise part of the LGBTQ community, adding that \\"Mr. VanDyke would not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him, notably members of the LGBTQ community.\\" On October 30, 2019, a hearing on VanDyke's nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Most of the two-hour hearing was focused on VanDyke's record on LGBTQ issues. During his confirmation hearing, VanDyke was asked by Senator Josh Hawley (R-MO), \\"Did you say that you wouldn't be fair to members of the LGBTQ community?\\" VanDyke broke down in tears, denying the accusation: \\"'I did not say that. I do not believe that. It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God and they should all be treated with dignity and respect'\\". Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), questioned VanDyke about an opinion editorial he wrote in 2004 while a student at Harvard Law noting that same-sex marriage may be harmful for children. VanDyke stated that his views had changed since that time. VanDyke said that during a three-hour meeting with the ABA, the ABA evaluator told him that she was in a \\"hurry\\" and did not give him the opportunity to fully respond to concerns. The ABA acknowledged that the lead ABA evaluator assigned to VanDyke, Montana attorney Marcia Davenport, contributed $150 to VanDyke's opponent in a 2014 Montana Supreme Court election. The ABA's treatment of VanDyke was denounced by conservative commentators. Writing for National Review, John McCormack asked: \\"Were VanDyke's comments to the ABA twisted or taken wildly out of context in order to paint him as a bigot? It is hard to believe any judicial nominee would suggest during an interview with the ABA that he might not be 'fair' to all litigants.\\" McCormack asked the ABA for a transcript of the relevant portion of its interview with VanDyke, but the ABA declined to provide one, citing confidentiality. Legal scholar Adam White, a former member of the ABA's Administrative Law Section, wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing that there was \\"no basis on which to evaluate any of the broad-brush descriptions of Mr. VanDyke. We don't know what basis, if any, his critics have for these judgments, or even who they are. We're expected to take the ABA's disparagement at face value\\". The Wall Street Journal editorial board also published a critique of the ABA's treatment of VanDyke. On November 21, 2019, VanDyke's nomination was reported out of committee by a party line 12–10 vote. On December 10, 2019, the full United States Senate invoked cloture on his nomination by a vote of 53–40. On December 11, 2019, his nomination was confirmed by a vote of 51–44. He received his judicial commission on January 2, 2020.

The species was list as vulnerable in 2014. Description The many-branched shrub typically grows to a height of and has an erect or spreading habit. It has small persistent stipules that are less than in length along the branchlets. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen flat and linear phyllodes have a length of and a width of and have a pungent-pointed apex. The phyllodes are usually thick and rigid and have often have three veins on each face with one more prominent than the others. It produces yellow flowers between September and October and fruits in February. The simple inflorescences are found singly or in pairs on spikes containing clusters of two to six flowers that are less than in length. The seed pods that form after flowering are subcylindrical or resemble a string of bead. The pods have a length of and a width of and contain elliptical to cylindrically shaped seeds that are long. Distribution The shrub is mostly situated in the agricultural area in lowland pastures of the Midlands, in north eastern Central Tasmania and also on Mount Barrow in the subalpine zone of north eastern Tasmania. It is distributed through five localities; Mount Barrow and within the Elizabeth, St Paul, Dukes and Lake River catchment areas. A total population of approximately 45,000 individuals is known across 18 populations.

Little information is known about Cui himself, though his position inside the North Shanxi Autonomous Government is apparent. Under the leadership of Cui Xiaoqian, Japanese efforts to extend their control of occupation were enacted, such as with the creation of the Labor Control Committee of North Shanxi.  Career  On October 15, 1937, Cui was appointed to the position of director within the Department of Finance of the North Shanxi Autonomous Government during the \\"Bring the Shanxi Province to Autonomy\\" conference held in Datong. It is unknown if Cui served any role in the interim administration of Chen Yuming while the region was still under direct Japanese army control before October 15, 1937, though this may have occurred. After this date however, Cui was given an official role within the new collaborationist government of North Shanxi along with Hashimoto Otoji, who served as his consultant. On November 23, 1937, a month after being appointed into the government of North Shanxi, Cui was appointed into the Mengjiang Bank Committee, a part of the Xingya Association. This position allowed Cui to maintain an important role in maintaining the region's economics, despite not being Japanese, or part of the Japanese government in a more direct manner. In mid-1939, the Labor Control Committee of North Shanxi () was created. This organization, which was under the control of the North Shanxi Department of Finance, pressed 8,000 Chinese laborers into coal mining operations in and around Datong until the group's dissolution in 1943. Some of Cui's economic decisions have been criticized, such as the lack of economic cohesion in North Shanxi at this time. Despite being an integral member of the so-called \\"economic unification\\" of Mengjiang, North Shanxi, and South Chahar, over 17 different currencies were used within the state. This lead to, as described by Zhang Fo of Hebei University, a \\"chaotic\\" situation. Under Cui, bank-made and company-made currencies were banned however, showing at least a basic effort towards economic centralization within the state. In 1938, Cui was replaced in his position by Chen Wenbing within the Mengjiang Bank Committee, though he was still part of the larger Xingya Association. The following year, however, Cui Xiaoqian lost his position within the North Shanxi Autonomous Government when it became a semi-autonomous province of Mengjiang, lessening the autonomy of the state to a point where the sub- national administration was not needed.

She was the daughter (or younger sister) of Hagar Cruvellier (fl. 1823) and the sister of Francis, Peter and Justine Cruvellier. She emigrated with her family to Savannah as a child. From 1812, she lived in Savannah, Georgia, where her family established a successful tailor shop. She initially worked in the family tailor workshop with her family as a seamstress. In 1825, she opened a bakery and pastry shop with her sister Justine. She became a very successful businesswoman. She married Samuel Mirault, with whom she had the daughters Louisa and Letitia. She was widowed in 1829 or 1831. By that time, she owned her own pastry shop. Like her mother and her sister, she used slave labour in her business: in 1839, she payed taxes for five female slaves. In 1842, she became a landowner when she bought a lot of land in the city of Savannah, auctioned by the city authorities. In 1818, non-white people was forbidden by law to buy land in the city of Savannah. However, it was common for wealthy Afro Americans in Savannah to get around the law by using a white representative to buy the land for them. Aspasia Cruvellier Mirault used the services of George Cally, who bought the land in his own name using her money. Formally, Cally was the owner of the land, but in reality, Cally and Cruvellier Mirault had an agreement in which the land was to be owned by her in all but name, and it appears that Cally respected the agreement. Cruvellier Mirault had a house built on her land which she used to expand her business and provide her family - children and grandchildren - with larger living space.

With a rising demand for gunpowder thanks to the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–1714) William was awarded his first contract in 1702, soon after acquiring the mills. Following his early death in 1711, Philippa, at that time 36 years old and with ten young children, took over the enterprise. She ran the mills independently until 1723, when she took one of her sons, John, into partnership with her. Under Philippa's ownership the Waltham Abbey Mills became one of the most important gunpowder mills in the country, featuring several horse mills and stamp mills. p. 6.

Legacy In 1757 John Walton died, and the factory was inherited by his brothers Thomas and Bouchier. Meanwhile, in the wake of the outbreak of the Seven Years' War, the Waltham Abbey gunpowder factory was becoming an increasingly important asset for the British Army. The British government began nationalising gunpowder mills in 1759, when it purchased the Faversham Mills; in 1787 the Crown acquired the Waltham Abbey Mills from the Walton family, making them one of the three Royal Gunpowder Mills in the United Kingdom (the others being at Ballincollig and Faversham).

Travelling extensively, he performed various jobs. He was involved in two prison escape attempts, in Manchester, where a policeman was shot dead, and in London, where twelve passers-by were blown up. Early life Burke was born on 24 January 1838 at Cloonareague, Kinneigh (Irish: Cluain Aimhréidh, Cinn Eich), in Co. Cork, Ireland. He was the youngest of twelve children born to Margaret (née O'Sullivan) and Denis Burke. The family was evicted from their farm by Lord Bandon possibly after Denis Burke supported the Chartist former member of parliament Feargus O'Connor. John Devoy wrote that Denis Burke was a civil engineer. The family moved to Dunmanway where Burke attended the National School and Model School. At age 15, he enrolled in the Cork Militia and remained there for three years. One account reports him as a militia \\"sergeant\\" and another as \\"corporal\\". Some accounts say he deserted the army, either because an officer struck him or because he was disillusioned. He joined family members in London; after failing to find work, he left England for the US, possibly to avoid court-martial. Devoy said that Burke was actually ashamed to go home as the Militia had dissolved in 1856 - it had effectively been a recruiting ground for the Crimean War (now ended, hence the dissolution) and was full of \\"corner-boys, tinkers and wastrels\\". He did odd jobs in New York, apparently including painting a portrait from a photo in Harlem. The client, a sea captain, gave him work as a deckhand or supercargo on his trading vessel. This fuelled tales of his romantic exploits: he allegedly gained \\"a mastery of seamanship\\" and \\"a fluency in the Spanish language\\"; he stopped for a year in Paris for linguistics and art studies; he prospected for gold in California, leading a band of sailors north and debarking at Cabo San Lucas, Baja California. Later, he continued overland to South America, surviving poison-laced wine and eventually joining a mostly- Irish militia or cavalry in Chile fighting native Americans. In 1861, he returned to New York. Career Accounts differ, but Burke enlisted with 15th Regiment of the New York State Volunteers (N.Y.S.V.) on the 17 June 1861, and is in the roster titled 'Fifteenth engineers' among those published in 1893 and 1905. The 15th N.Y.S.V. received instruction in army engineering (they were known as \\"sappers\\") at Alexandria, Virginia and were associated with works like trenches, barriers, bridges etc. around various engagements including Yorktown, Gettysburg and Petersburg. He was never hurt: only 5 of the regiment died in action; 124 perished from disease etc. Devoy reported that he was demustered in Virginia on 13 June 1865, having been granted the rank of brevet colonel. John Joseph Corydon, a witness for the prosecution in his trial in London in 1868, said he knew Burke as a sergeant in the Federal army in 1862 and that Burke became a lieutenant, then a captain. This is confirmed in army records: one document held in public records in Chicago records him as a 2nd lieutenant (also held there is his citizenship document, dated 1865); the New York State Military Museum record indicates his sequence of ranks in different companies until - on 13 June - mustering out as captain at Fort Berry, Virginia. After mustering out, he offered his services to John O'Mahony (head of the Fenian Brotherhood in New York), biding his time working as a bookkeeper before being sent to Ireland some months later. Once there, Thomas Kelly (who ousted James Stephens as head of the Irish Republican Brotherhood) sent him to England to purchase arms, but funding was hampered by Fenian divisions in the U.S. He returned to New York in 1866, and was back in Ireland at the start of 1867 for the Fenian rising (in charge of Waterford), which was a failure. On 13 April, the Jacmel under Captain Cavanagh put to sea from New York loaded with thousands of guns and forty Fenians. Rebadged as Erin's Hope mid-Atlantic, it anchored off the Co. Sligo coast. Signals to shore from the vessel were ignored. It is not clear if Burke boarded the ship or Cavanagh went ashore, but Burke told Cavanagh the rising was a flop. Thirty men who went ashore in Waterford were arrested. The ship avoided capture and returned to the US, its cargo of weapons intact. Arrests and escape attempts On 27 December 1867, Burke was arrested by police related to an incident involving Joseph Theobald Casey in St Pancras, London. He gave the name 'George Berry'. After some inquiries, it was established who he was. In February 1868, he was indicted at Warwick Spring Assizes with Casey and a Harry Mullady, who had been on remand for a year under the alias 'Henry Shaw'. Burke and Casey were accused - correctly in Burke's case - of organizing the escape of Thomas Kelly and Timothy Deasy, as they were being transferred to Belle Vue Gaol, Manchester. One of the armed Fenian group who attacked the prison carriage, Peter Rice, fired through the lock. The police sergeant inside, Charles Brett, took the bullet in the eye and was killed. Burke had bought or ordered hundreds of guns and huge quantities of percussion caps in Birmingham in 1865. Witnesses said he joined Fenian meetings in Liverpool, Manchester and other cities, during which plans were made to raid the armoury at Chester Castle on 11 February 1867 (about 2000 rifles purchased by him had been stored in Liverpool). While he was on remand at Clerkenwell Prison, London, on 13 December 1867, Fenians used gunpowder to blow up the wall of the exercise yard for Burke's escape; this was their second attempt. The plan was executed by Jeremiah O'Sullivan, who was part of a London-based I.R.B. group set up by Burke, and who had managed to exchange notes with him in gaol; the signal for the imminent detonation was a white rubber ball thrown over the wall. At the first signal, Burke was seen to move away from the wall and inspect his shoe. The bomb's fuse failed; a prison warder picked up the ball for his children. Information from Ireland that had already been received by the police of an attempted rescue for Burke was passed on, so police patrols were increased and the prison governor confined prisoners to cells. A second attempt the following day worked, but with an empty exercise yard. The huge blast destroyed an eighteen-metre section of the wall. Twelve local people were killed, up to one hundred and twenty injured and homes and shops on Corporation Row were devastated. Working-class sympathy in England for the Fenian cause was dealt a significant blow: London resident, Karl Marx, and political activist, Charles Bradlaugh, were scornful, with Marx writing that the atrocity was a gift to the British rulers against Irish emancipation. Of six people charged at the Old Bailey on 20 April 1868, only Michael Barrett was found guilty (on 27 April): he was a Fenian transported from Scotland whose name had been provided under interrogation by one of the accused and whose identity was confirmed by a young boy. On 26 May, he became the last person publicly executed in England, having eloquently protested his innocence. Burke, Casey, and Mullady were charged with treason-felony at the Old Bailey because of the escape of Kelly and testimony from arms merchants and informers about weapons purchases and reports of their involvement at Fenian meetings. Burke was sentenced to fifteen years in prison and Mullady seven years; Casey was acquitted. Prison conditions were typically poor. While in prison, Burke was spoken of in the House of Commons as effectively being on a slow-starvation diet which had driven him mad. In a self-diagnosis, Burke said he was being poisoned with a compound of mercury administered by the prison doctor, Dr. Steele. He was removed from Chatham prison to Woking Prison (for invalided male convicts) and thence to the new Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum, from where he was released in 1871 due to illness. [Devoy, who was in Chatham prison with Burke, claimed that the attempt at poisoning was true, saying a sample of Burke's stomach contents had been surreptitiously smuggled out for chemical analysis but that Burke had feigned insanity.] A weakened Burke went to his brother's home in Co.Cork to recuperate. Later life In 1874, Burke returned to the U.S. Public records in Chicago describe Burke as a 'public official' during the 1880s and 1890s. From the mid 1870s, he was a clerk at the War Department in Washington D.C. He lectured on Irish nationalism when he could, and he campaigned for the Republicans, including at Fort Wayne, Indiana, where he stayed for some time in rooms. He was charged with associating with a prostitute in October 1880. The highly supportive Fort Wayne Daily Gazette described the charge as \\"preposterous\\" and engineered by Democrats. He was acquitted. He decided to settle in Fort Wayne, having met Nora Sheehy (a Democrat), a local woman and his wife-to-be. After campaigning, he returned to his job in Washington D.C. In 1881, he left his Washington job to work on railways in Mexico. He was joined by the new Mrs. Burke in November that year and they settled in Monterrey. The Fort Wayne Weekly Sentinel, referred to Burke over a few years as someone who \\"styles himself Colonel\\" and an \\"alleged Colonel\\", usually printing the rank in inverted commas (29 September 1880, 13 October 1880, 20 October 1880 and 3 November 1880). On 14 February 1883, in addition to a few compliments, Burke's life is described as a \\"racket\\" with the rank \\"colonel\\" gained from a Fenian attack on Canada and even the title \\"general\\" taken from his alleged activities in Chile. It described his hurried escape back to Fort Wayne from creditors in Mexico, having frittered local funding on a lavish new hotel in Monterrey, where he entertained Americans and Europeans with frequent parties and enjoyed an extravagant lifestyle. The Gazette, however, continued its praise, calling him a \\"brilliant Irishman\\" about to be interviewed by the Chicago Tribune. Burke continued his support for the Fenian cause, even with the schisms on both sides of the Atlantic. In January 1888, Burke's friend, Dr. Patrick Cronin, disappeared and he suspected foul play at the hands of 'the triangle', a presumptuous cabal of Clan na Gael (the successor to the Fenian Brotherhood) in Chicago made up of Alexander Sullivan supported by Michael Boland and Denis Feely. Cronin - whose faction in Clan na Gael Burke supported, and who had accused Sullivan's triangle of stealing hardship money for Fenian activists - was found murdered in a sewer in May 1889. In the public outrage, Clan na Gael was permanently damaged. https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84024779/1889-07-11/ed-1/seq-4/#date1=1883&index;=2&date2;=1900&searchType;=advanced&language;=eng&sequence;=0&lccn;=&words;=Burke+Ricard&proxdistance;=5&state;=&rows;=20&ortext;=&proxtext;=Ricard+Burke&phrasetext;=&andtext;=&dateFilterType;=yearRange&page;=1 As late as 1911, he was still involved in purchasing large quantities of weaponry for distribution amongst Fenians in the U.S. In 1912, aged 74, he was recorded as an 'assistant engineer' in the rivers and harbour section of the Department of Public Works for Chicago. In September 1913, he suffered a stroke with a poor prognosis. At the same time, his son, Ricard Jr., had tuberculosis (to which he succumbed). A further stroke paralysed him and he was bedridden for five-and-a-half years. On 12 July 1919, the future Irish president, Éamon de Valera, visited Burke briefly during his glad-handing tour of Chicago. =Death= He died on 11 May 1922. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Chicago. Accounts Presentations of Burke's life are often contradictory with embroidered or untrue elements: in his lifetime, he was accused of authoring much of the embellishment. His friend and fellow Fenian, John Devoy, said the story of his life \\"reads more like a romance than a record of actual facts\\" and related his ability to charm his hosts. For example, various accounts refer to him reaching the rank of brevet colonel for the Union, and he used the title, even though he was demustered as a captain. It has been said he helped John Philip Holland build a submarine: Fenians provided funds but - after an internal financial dispute - stole the craft, which they were incapable of operating thereafter. He has also been described as a \\"burly six-footer\\" when his height is evident in a 1906 photograph in which he is well short of six-feet-four Robert R. McCormick.

It is located in a remote area, a few hundred metres from the Man Kam To Control Point, a border crossing facility between Hong Kong and China. San Uk Ling Holding Centre opened in July 1979 to house illegal immigrants prior to their repatriation. San Uk Ling was used to detain protesters during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, and there have been controversial allegations of mistreatment and sexual violence which have been vehemently denied by the police. History =Establishment and early years= The San Uk Ling holding centre was constructed by the government of the then British Hong Kong in 1979 as an immigration detention facility. The increasing numbers of illegal immigrants attempting to sneak into Hong Kong from China had overburdened an existing detention facility at Ta Kwu Ling, which could only accommodate 60 people. The San Uk Ling facility, with a capacity of around 600, was built to hold illegal immigrants prior to their repatriation across the Chinese border, about a kilometre to the north. The holding centre was formally established in July 1979. Due to the huge increase in illegal immigration that year, the Hong Kong Auxiliary Police Force was mobilised, with several platoons posted to the San Uk Ling facility. It is located immediately south of Man Kam To Control Point, a border crossing which was, until 1985, the only vehicular road link between Hong Kong and China. It was Hong Kong's policy to return illegal immigrants to China within 24 hours of capture. Each day, those held at San Uk Ling were taken to the Man Kam To border crossing and handed over at 12:30 pm. Given the short duration that people were detained there, accommodation at San Uk Ling was rudimentary, with units divided only by steel fencing. By mid-1986, illegal immigration had declined, and the facility only held around 40 people on a daily basis. In late 1989 and early 1990, San Uk Ling Holding Centre was converted into a special facility designed to house Vietnamese refugees who were awaiting forced repatriation following their classification as non-refugees. Security was strengthened at this time, and the accommodation was improved. However, it is unclear if the facility was ever used for this purpose. The holding centre's five residential huts were reportedly fitted with air conditioners in April 1991. In early 1992, the maximum capacity of the facility was said to be 689. Following the Tiananmen Square massacre of 4 June 1989, San Uk Ling was used as a temporary shelter for movement leaders who were transported to Hong Kong during Operation Yellowbird. During the WTO Ministerial Conference in 2005, arrested militant Korean farmers were sent to San Uk Ling. = 2019–20 Hong Kong protests = During the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, some arrested protestors were sent to San Uk Ling as an overspill detention facility after 5 August 2019. On 11 August 2019 alone, 54 people who were arrested in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui were sent there. While Yuen Long, Tuen Mun, Pat Heung, and Sheung Shui police stations being located closer to downtown Hong Kong and having some detainee capacity, San Uk Ling is more remote, making it difficult for arrested persons to contact outsiders. There are no closed-circuit televisions in the entrance and exit passages, meeting rooms and search rooms of San Uk Ling. In September 2019, 31 people detained in San Uk Ling were sent to North District Hospital, among whom six were seriously injured with bone fractures. One person was reportedly beaten to the point that his arm was connected to his torso only through skin. Others reportedly had their teeth beaten out, and some reportedly suffered intracerebral haemorrhages. There were also allegations of delays in sending the injured to the hospital, and deprivation of necessary medication. Some protesters taken to San Uk Ling also alleged sexual assault by officers there. Six justices of the peace who had wanted to visit San Uk Ling to investigate allegations of mistreatment there saw their request denied. The Police Public Relations Branch said that all the allegations against the centre were \\"unnamed\\", \\"unverified\\" and \\"untrue\\", that it had been nothing more than a standard detention facility, used in line with police regulations. They said that the centre had since 2 September not been used to hold arrested protesters, who would in future be sent to police stations across the city in case of mass arrests. The spokesman further added that the decision \\"has nothing to do with the groundless allegations of police of misconduct, and that it was a necessary step \\"to avoid any further public speculation and unnecessary remarks\\" as to its continued use. Operations and characteristics Unlike other prisons in Hong Kong, which are run by the Correctional Services Department, San Uk Ling is jointly operated by the Hong Kong Police Force and Immigration Department. As of 2019, the facility continues to be used to hold captured illegal immigrants prior to their repatriation. The facility falls under the purview of the Ta Kwu Ling Divisional Police Station. According to a 2019 statement by the Secretary for Security, San Uk Ling contains four cell blocks containing a total of 16 detention cells, which can collectively accommodate around 200 prisoners in total. The cells have stone beds, lighting, air conditioning, and toilets. The complex also has interview rooms. Contrary to popular belief, the detention centre is no longer located within the Frontier Closed Area, as the size of the closed area was reduced in recent years.

He held pro- Austrian political views and was a close associate of Toma Vučić Perišić. He attended high school in Timișoara and went to study law in Budapest. In 1834 he arrived in Serbia and was appointed clerk at the chancery of Prince Miloš Obrenović. In 1839 he returned to the Prince's chancery, only to witness the coming to power of the Karađorđević dynasty headed by Prince Alexander Karađorđević, who accelerated Aleksa Janković's career. As of 1864 Janković became an honorary member of the Society Of Serbian Letters, which later became the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.

Loop 300 Loop 300 was a proposed state highway loop in Snyder. Loop 300 was designated on February 23, 1956 from US 180 west of Snyder around the city's west and south sides to US 84 southeast of Snyder. The route was never built, and was cancelled on October 1, 1968. Loop 301 Loop 301 is a state highway loop in Sulphur Springs, it starts at the junction of SH 19 and SH 154, and ends at Interstate 30/US 67. Loop 301 was designated on February 23, 1956, from US 67 (later Loop 313; now Business U.S. Highway 67-V) and SH 19 in west Sulphur Springs, northward to SH 154. On September 21, 1965, it was extended southeast to IH 30. On April 27, 1967, the section from SH 154 southwest to Loop 313 was transferred to SH 19. Loop 302 Loop 302 was a state highway loop in Greenville. Loop 302 was designated on March 29, 1956 as a loop off US 67 in Greenville as a replacement of US 67 when it was rerouted. The route was signed as Business US 67 rather than Loop 302. On December 14, 1960 the section from along Wellington Street from Lee Street to the south side of Greenville was removed from the highway system. The remainder of Loop 302 was cancelled on June 21, 1990 and transferred to Business US 67-T (now Spur 302). Loop 304 Loop 304 is a beltway within Crockett, the county seat of Houston County. It is in length. It was established in on March 28, 1956. Nearly all of the loop is two lanes wide (one lane in each direction), and provides access for long distance travelers and trucks to bypass the downtown core. Populated areas also dot outside the loop, but have less population density. ;Junction list Loop 305 Loop 306 State Loop 306 before US 277/87 interchange Loop 306 is a state loop that encircles much of San Angelo. Loop 306 begins on the north side of San Angelo, at the US 67/277 interchange, and continues south on the eastern edge of town. The highway multiplexes with US 87 while being routed west. The multiplex ends at the US 87/277/Loop 306 interchange, with Loop 306 routed northwest. Loop 306 ends at the Business US 67 (Sherwood Way) overpass, however the freeway continues and is signed as US 67, Houston Harte Expressway; named after the San Angelo-native publishing magnate. The route is often referred to locally as \\"the Loop\\" or \\"Loop 306\\", despite the terminus of Loop 306 at Sherwood Way. TxDOT upgraded portions of Loop 306 to expand it from a two-lane road to a four-lane divided highway. From the US 67/277 interchange, Loop 306 continues as a four-lane divided highway all the way to US 87. The upgrades included adding two overpasses and improvements to a divided highway. Loop 306 was designated on October 24, 1956. On July 30, 1976, the section from US 67 west and southwest to US 67 was transferred to rerouted US 67. ;Junction list Loop 307 Loop 307 was a proposed state highway loop in Teague. Loop 307 was designated on February 23, 1956 from US 84 (now Business US 84) north of Teague east and south to SH 179, 1 mile east of Teague. On October 21, 1959 the section from old US 84 to new US 84 was redesignated as US 84. The remainder of Loop 307 was cancelled on April 30, 2004 and removed from the highway system because the route was already part of FM 553 (it was completed in 1978). Loop 308 Loop 310 Loop 310 was a state highway loop in Carrollton. Loop 310 was designated on February 23, 1956 as a loop off US 77 (now IH 35E) in Carrollton. On January 21, 1991 Loop 310 was cancelled and returned to the city of Carrollton. Loop 311 Loop 311 was a state highway loop in Kilgore. Loop 311 was designated on August 1, 1956 from SH 259 in downtown Kilgore west 2.4 miles to SH 135 near the west edge of Kilgore. The route was signed as Business SH 135 rather than Loop 311. On June 14, 1968 Loop 311 was cancelled and removed from the highway system. Loop 313 Loop 313 was a state highway loop in Sulphur Springs. Loop 313 was designated on September 16, 1956 from SH 19/US 67, north along SH 19 to old US 67 at the west edge of Sulphur Springs, then east along old US 67 to new US 67 near the east edge of Sulphur Springs as a replacement of US 67 when it was rerouted. The route was signed as Business US 67 rather than Loop 313. On April 27, 1967 the section along SH 19 was cancelled and Loop 313 was extended to IH 30, replacing FM 164. On November 30, 1987 a section was rerouted in the downtown area, moving the eastern terminus to Loop 301. Loop 313 was cancelled on June 21, 1990 and transferred to Business US 67-V. Loop 315 Loop 315 was a state highway loop in Greenville. Loop 315 was designated on November 21, 1956 from US 69 near Peniel south to US 67 southwest of Greenville. On November 30, 1961 the road was extended east over old US 67 to IH 30, and southeast to US 69 on October 13, 1971. On May 21, 1979 Loop 315 was routed over US 69 while the old route of Loop 315 was transferred to US 69. Loop 315 was cancelled on June 21, 1990 and transferred to Business US 69-D. Loop 316 Loop 316 was a state highway loop in Loraine. Loop 316 was designated on February 26, 1957 as a loop off US 80 (now IH 20) in Loraine. On June 21, 1990 Loop 316 was cancelled and transferred to Business IH 20-K. Loop 318 =Loop 318 (1957)= The first use of Loop 318 was in Callahan County, from US 380 west and north to FM 576, then east along FM 576 to US 380.

The cluster, part of the Appalachian Mountains in southwest Virginia, connects wildlands in the high country of Garden Mountain and adjacent streams and ridges in one of the most remote areas of Virginia. Description The Garden Mountain Cluster contains seven wildlands with different degrees of protection: wilderness areas, a study area and two areas recognized by the Wilderness Society as \\"Mountain Treasures\\", areas that are worthy of protection from logging and road construction. The areas in the cluster are: *Wilderness Areas **Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness **Garden Mountain Wilderness **Beartown Wilderness *Study Areas **Lynn Camp Creek Wilderness Study Area *Wild areas recognized by the Wilderness Society as \\"Mountain Treasures\\" **Beartown Wilderness Addition A **Beartown Wilderness Addition B Location and access center Panorama view of Burke's Garden The cluster extends around the western, southern and eastern sides of Burke's Garden. VA 16, on the southern side, and VA 42, on the eastern side, intersect with roads leading into the cluster. Access from Burke's Garden is somewhat restricted because of the steep rise of the slopes around the bowl forming the garden. The Appalachian Trail passes through the full length of the cluster for 26.6 miles. From north to south, the trail crosses Va 615, Suiter Road, to enter the cluster at Hunting Camp Creek Wilderness. The trail climbs Brushy Mountain, then descends to cross Hunting Camp Creek, passes by Jenkins Shelter, climbs Garden Mountain, continues along the ridge of Garden Mountain with views of Burke’s Garden, passes by Davis Farm Campsite, and crosses Va 623. The trail then enters Garden Mountain Wilderness continuing along the ridge of Garden Mountain. After leaving Garden Mountain Wilderness, the trail passes by Chestnut Ridge Shelter, goes along the boundary of Beartown Wilderness then turns south, descends through Beartown Wilderness Addition B, crosses USFS road 222, Poor Valley Road, to reach Lick Creek. Now the trail enters Lynn Camp Creek Wilderness Study Area, crosses over Lynn Camp Mountain reaching Lynn Camp Creek, then ascends Brushy Mountain passing Knot Maul Branch Shelter before descending to VA 42 to exit the cluster at the boundary of the wilderness study area. Roads and trails in the cluster are shown on National Geographic Map 787 (Blacksburg, New River Valley). A great variety of information, including topographic maps, aerial views, satellite data and weather information, is obtained by selecting the link with the wild land's coordinates in the upper right of this page. Biological significance Hellbender, Cryptobranchus alleganiensis The land form, climate, soils and geology of the Appalachian highlands, as well as its evolutionary history, have created one of the most diverse collection of plants and animals in the deciduous forests of the temperate world. The cluster's large tract of land supports species, such as black bear and some bird species, that require extensive tracts of unbroken forest for survival. The cluster provides habitat and watershed for species that are critically imperiled (G1), imperiled (G2) or vulnerable (G3), as indicated by their NatureServe conservation status. The Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation, Natural Heritage Program gives a list of these species for the counties included in the cluster, Bland, Smyth and Wythe.

The Ridge and Valley Province is composed of long, relatively level-crested, ridges with highest elevations reaching over . The province marks the eastern boundary in the Paleozoic era of an older land surface on the east. It was uplifted and eroded during the Paleozoic with extensive folding and thrust-faulting. Resistant quartzite, conglomerates and sandstones form the ridge caps while less resistant shales and limestones eroded to form the intervening valleys. The province is part of the Appalachian Mountains. Garden Mountain extends from Abingdon to the New River, where the ridge of Garden Mountain continues across the river but is now named Sinking Creek Mountain. The mountain completely surrounds Burkes Garden, an unusual geologic formation. From above Burke's Garden looks like the remnant of a volcano or a large lake. It is about 10 miles long and 5 miles wide (16 × 8 km). Called the Great Swamp by native Americans, it was probably too wet for crops. There are several proposals about its creation. One claims the valley was a lake drained by a creek, Burke's Garden Creek, flowing through the gap on the western edge. Another claims it was a dome formed by a sandstone cap. Eroded by water, the cap cracked forming a flat valley below. The Tennessee Valley Divide passes through the cluster along the southern rim of Burke's Garden, dividing the drainage for the Tennessee River and the New River. Roaring Fork, Lick Creek and Lynn Camp Creek, on the southwest, flow into the North Holston River which then flows into the Tennessee. Hunting Camp Creek, on the northeast, is part of the New River drainage. Both the New River and Tennessee River flow into the Ohio River. Cultural history Burke's Garden According to legend, Burke's Garden was discovered in about 1748 by James Burk while chasing a wounded elk. After eating some potatoes, he covered the peelings with dirt in order to hide his presence from Indians. Later explorers, finding a large patch of potatoes that had sprouted from the peelings, named the place as \\"Burk's Garden\\". The \\"e\\" on the end of the name was added at a later time. The area was settled by German Lutherans who were so attached to the area that they refused to sell their land to George Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt, looking for a place to build a home, moved to North Carolina where he built the largest private home in America, the Biltmore Estate. Tazewell, Virginia Tazewell, the largest town near the cluster and the seat of Tazewell County, has served as the financial center for the agricultural and coal mining interests in the region. Evidence of prosperity is given by the large homes built on several hills. The town was incorporated in 1866. The county was named for Henry Tazewell, who served from 1794 to 1799 as a United States senator.

It was released on September 20, 2019, through Elektra Records. The digital release of the album has 17 songs, and is the band's longest album to date.  Background  Before the album was released, several singles were dropped over the course of a couple months. The first single, \\"123456\\", was released on March 20, 2019. A music video was released on the same day. The next one to be released was \\"Don't Ever Let 'Em\\" on April 17, 2019. This song was then followed by \\"I Need Help!\\", which was released on May 2 of the year. On June 28, the album was officially announced and able to be pre-ordered, and a song of the same name, \\"All the Feels\\", was also released on the same day. The music video \\"sees Fitz gain a brighter outlook on life after receiving (non-graphic) open-heart surgery.\\" Another song, \\"I Just Wanna Shine\\", was released on July 14, 2019. The album was released on September 20. In an interview, when asked his purpose in making the album, Fitzpatrick said he and the band \\"[had] been releasing songs every couple weeks.\\" He continued, \\"[We're] giving people a preview of what it's gonna be like. What's really great is that you get to play it for your fans and right then and there, you kind get a get a sense of what they're feeling and the reaction has been amazing. We worked really hard on this record,\\" he explained. \\"It's a big record, like 17 songs long, but we wanted to do all the feels.\\" The band actually started with 80 songs and narrowed it down. Billboard described the album as deep and emotional compared to the band's other works, with some of the \\"most raw of the songs they've released so far, with a pulsating melody to match the vulnerable - yet uplifting - lyrics like \\"We dive right into the deep end/ You win, you lose/ You get back up and try again.\\" Another news magazine described the title track \\"All the Feels\\" as a song \\"about wanting more out of a relationship, really trying to feel a connection with somebody,\\" and considered it to be a great summer song.  Touring  The band started their first tour to promote the album with Young the Giant in North America on June 28, 2019, in Columbus, Ohio. It ended on August 16, 2019, in Las Vegas. Another tour after the album's release will pick up on February 28, 2020 in Chicago.

Personal and early life Hunting was born in Hoxne, England in 1597. He had strong opinions and from an early age began speaking on religious topics. In particular, he opposed the Catholic views of Charles I. He became the ruling elder of his local church district and spent much time traveling and ministering to those in the area. His ministry and effort to gain converts caused him to spend a great deal of time away from his family. He married Hester Seaborn, a second cousin of the martyr John Rogers. They and their five children sailed to New England in 1638 and quickly settled in Dedham, Massachusetts. His son, Samuell Hunting, lived in Charlestown. His oldest son was named John, and he had a daughters Mary Buckner, Heaster Fisher, Elizabeth Pecke, and Margaret Ware. His sister, Susan, married Edward Richards. At his death on April 12, 1689, he had an estate valued at £153.03.11. Founder of Dedham Hunting was admitted as a freeman in Dedham on March 13, 1639 and was one of the original proprietors of land there. Beginning in 1758, he served 15 years as Selectman in Dedham. First Church Shortly after settling what became Dedham, Massachusetts in 1635, residents formed a church, today known as First Church and Parish in Dedham. After the doctrinal base was agreed upon, 10 men were selected to seek out the \\"living stones\\" upon which the congregation would be based. Hunting, a freeman, was chosen as one of the 10. The group began to meet separately and, one by one, would leave the room so that the others could elect or reject them. They decided that six of their own number--John Allen, Ralph Wheelock, John Luson, John Fray, Eleazer Lusher, and Robert Hindell--were suitable to form the church. Hunting, who was new to the town, was also deemed acceptable. The eight chosen men submitted themselves to a conference of the entire community. After the church was gathered, a \\"tender\\" search for the flock's first minister settled upon John Allen. After selecting Allin as pastor, the names of Ralph Wheelock, John Hunting, Thomas Carter, and John Kingsbury were put forward for the role of ruling elder with Hunting eventually being selected. The selection process was not easy. On April 24, 1639, a day of fasting and prayer, Hunting and Allen were ordained in the presence of the Dedham congregation and the elders of other churches. The hands of Allen, Wheelock, and Edward Allyne were laid upon Hunting during his ordination and those of Hunting, Wheelock, and Allyne were laid upon Allen for his ordination. Legacy Hunting died April 12, 1689 and is buried at the Old Village Cemetery. Two hundred years later, the first Catholic Mass in Dedham was celebrated in Sunday, May 15, 1843, in the home of Daniel Slattery. The home was located on land once owned by Hunting.

The U.S. state of West Virginia is divided into fifty-five counties, each of which is further subdivided into magisterial districts. The U.S. Census Bureau defines these districts as non-functioning subdivisions used for various purposes, such as conducting elections, apportioning county officials from different areas, recording land ownership, assessing property taxes, and collecting vital statistics. Magisterial districts possess no governmental organization or authority. After attaining independence from Virginia in 1863, West Virginia's counties were divided into civil townships, with the goal of placing authority in the hands of local governments. However, township government proved impractical across the heavily rural state, with citizens unable to meet on a regular basis, and inadequate tax revenue to meet township responsibilities.Otis K. Rice & Stephen W. Brown, West Virginia: A History, 2nd ed., University Press of Kentucky, Lexington (1993), p. 240. Following the adoption of the Constitution of West Virginia in 1872, the townships were converted into magisterial districts, and the county courts (later county commissions) empowered to establish, consolidate, or otherwise modify them.W. Va. Code § 7–2–2. > Each county shall be laid off by the county court into magisterial > districts, not less than three nor more than ten in number, and as nearly > equal as may be in territory and population. The districts as they now exist > shall remain until changed by the county court. The county court may, from > time to time, increase or diminish the number of such districts, and change > the boundary lines thereof as necessity may require, in order to conform the > same to the provisions of the Constitution of the State. The only state other than West Virginia to use magisterial districts as a minor civil division of its counties is Virginia, which like West Virginia initially established a system of civil townships, in its Constitution of 1870. These were replaced by magisterial districts in 1874.Library of Virginia, \\"A Guide to the Frederick County (Va.) Township Records, 1871–1875\\" (2010). For most of the state's history, there were three hundred and fifty magisterial districts in West Virginia, an average of six districts per county. Greenbrier, Harrison, Mason, Ohio, and Wood Counties each contained ten districts, the maximum number provided for by state law. Brooke, Grant, and Hancock were the only counties with the minimum number of three. Twenty- four different counties included a Union District, thirteen had districts named after Ulysses S. Grant, and nine counties each had districts named for George Washington and Henry Clay. Beginning in the 1970s, many counties combined or consolidated their original magisterial districts in order to equalize their area and population, creating districts that were fewer in number, but larger in area.United States Census Bureau, U.S. Decennial Census, Tables of Minor Civil Divisions of West Virginia, 1870–2010. This created confusion with county land and tax records, in response to which the legislature provided for the establishment of tax districts following the former magisterial district lines, as they existed on January 1, 1969. In these counties, the new magisterial districts are used only for the allocation of county officials, and the collection of census data; the former magisterial districts continue to exist in the form of tax districts.W.

The chemical components of such solutions can be chromatographically separated into polar and nonpolar components. Developed as a laboratory class experiment, it can be used to demonstrate chemistry concepts of polarity, chemical kinetics, and chemiluminescence.  Description  In the chromatography of a glow stick solution, a piece of chalk is used as the stationary phase while nonpolar liquids like acetone and 91% isopropyl alcohol can be used as the mobile phase. Chalk is made up of calcium carbonate (CaCO2) or calcium sulfate (CaSO4), and therefore contains ions. This allows it to attract other ions and polar molecules, but not nonpolar molecules. With that, in this experiment, ionic and polar dyes would be attracted to the stationary phase and move relatively slowly over a small distance, while nonpolar dyes would wick up with the mobile phase and travel farther. This then allows for the separation of dyes.  Experiment  thumbDiagram of glowmatography with purple dye. 1: Solvent travels up the chalk. 2: Separation starts as the red dye is attracted to the mobile phase and starts traveling up while the blue dye is attracted to the stationary phase and stays relatively still. 3: Complete separation occurs as time passes. This experiment can be conducted with glow sticks, chalks, and solutions of acetone or isopropyl alcohol. Drops of glowing fluid from a glow stick are added to a chalk so that a band is created halfway through it. The chalk is then placed vertically into a beaker filled with a small amount of acetone or alcohol - ensuring the surface of the solvent is below the dye band. The liquid is then allowed to travel up the chalk; polar dyes would tend to stick to the chalk and not travel significantly while non-polar dyes would travel up with the solvent. Once it travels almost to the top of the chalk, it is removed from the beaker. The chalk chromatogram, with separation of colours, can then be observed in a dark room. Demonstration of glowmatography; experiment done over a span of about half an hour. Additionally, this glomatographic experiment can be done using other materials. For instance, silica gel can be used as the stationary phase together with a solution of nonpolar hexanes acting as the mobile phase. The polar components would be attracted to the polar silanol (Si-OH) groups on the surface of the silica gel, and the nonpolar components would travel further with the hexanes. Further, dyes in glow sticks can also be extracted using liquid carbon dioxide (CO2) as an environmentally friendly or green solvent. In this case, non polar dyes would dissolve in the liquid CO2 and other dyes would be attracted to cotton.

First mass By the early 1800s, a few Catholics had settled in Dedham. At the time, Dedham and the surrounding area was part of the missionary territory of St. Mary's in Waltham. Though a large area, stretching as far west as Concord and as far south as Walpole, it is estimated there were fewer than 300 Catholics. It was difficult for many to travel to Waltham, and so Father James Strain offered to travel halfway to meet the Catholics in the outlying areas. Slattery offered his home and to provide Strain with transportation. The first Mass in Dedham was celebrated in Sunday, May 15, 1843, with eight Catholics present. An altar was set up by the window. For the next three years Slattery's 17-year-old brother-in-law, John Doggett, would bring Strain from Waltham and back to minister to the needs of the small congregation. Location of the home While the Slattery home is still standing, at the corner of Washington and Worthington Streets, at the time of the first mass it was on the corner of Washington and High, where the Police Station sits in 2019. During the Revolution, the Worthington Street land was the site of an encampment for French troops under the command of Count Rochambeau. The home's original location was first owned by Daniel Morse and then became the homestead of John Hunting, the first ruling elder of the First Church and Parish in Dedham in 1638. Slattery purchased it from Martin Marsh. Daniel Slattery Slattery was born in Ireland in 1805 and moved to Dedham while still young. He married Catherine Doggett of Dedham on April 14, 1837 at the Cathedral of the Holy Cross. Together they had five sons. When Catherine died in 1849, the hands of the clock were stopped at the hour of her death. The unusual occurrence of a Catholic funeral mass elicited much interest around the town. He married again to Margaret Coleman of Dedham, and together they had one son and two daughters. His oldest son, who was 23 at the outbreak of the American Civil War, enlisted for 99 days with the Minutemen and then with the 14th Massachusetts Artillery for the duration of the war. Another son, Charles, who was 17, also enlisted and died in Virginia. Patrick, another son, returned home unharmed and died in the early 1900s. As of 1923, he had two sons, Edward and Thomas, living in Canton, Massachusetts and a daughter in Dedham. Slattery was well regarded among his fellow Dedhamites. He was well educated, had a practical knowledge of agriculture and arbor culture, and set out many of the trees in Dedham. He also held \\"considerable property.\\" Slattery moved to Needham in 1854 and died on May 2, 1856.

This bird was split from its congener, the Halmahera paradise-crow (L. pyrrhopterus) in 2016. The species was first described and named by Heinrich Agathon Bernstein in 1865.  Etymology  The Obi paradise-crow's scientific name is Lycocorax obiensis, consisting of Lycocorax, meaning \\"jackdaw-crow\\", which refers to its overall crow-like appearance of a jackdaw, and obiensis which refers to the Obi Islands where the birds are found.  Description  Obi paradise-crows are blackish overall, with a bluish-green sheen/iridescence to the feathers. The flight feathers are a light brownish, and the tail feathers have a pronounced bluish sheen to them. They have a crow-like head and bill; the bill is a cool light gray. Also, they have distinctive and beautiful, scarlet-red eyes and blackish to grayish legs and feet with sharp claws adapted for their perching lifestyles. The calls of this bird sounds reminiscent of a trumpet-like hwoot hwoot, followed by a click click. The calls of the Obi paradise-crow is one of the most recognizable sounds in its range.  Behavior and ecology  The biology of this bird has not been studied in full detail. Their diets consist predominately of fruits, supplemented by the occasional invertebrate. The birds typically feed solitarily, but also in pairs, small groups and even in association with other bird species, like imperial pigeons.. Its breeding period is not defined, but nests and eggs have been recorded from December to June. The nest is a cup-like shape consisting of moss, leaves, vines, and wood chips. Clutch is one egg. Incubation and chick rearing details unknown..  Habitat and distribution  The Obi paradise-crow is found on Obi and Bisa islands in the Obi group, south of Halmahera, the home of its congener. They are found in tropical forest and forest edge at 1200 m in altitude on Obi island.

Biography  Gargallo was born most probably in the Valencian Community. He entered as a child in the choir of the Valencia Cathedral towards 1648-1649 and stayed there until 1651 or 1652. There he received his first musical training given by the mestres de capella Francesc Navarro (until 1650) and Dídac Pontac. On 7 June 1659, Gargallo succeeded the mestre de capella of the Huesca Cathedral, a position where Vargas i Babán had preceded him. He resigned to the place on 15 November 1667 to join two days later in the Barcelona Cathedral in the same position. As usual, he entered temporarily until the death of the holder, Marcià Albareda (21 August 1673), replacing him after that. Among his disciples in Barcelona, there were the future mestres de capella and composers and Isidre Serrada. Upon his death, Gargallo was replaced temporarily by Jaume Riera, until took on the position on 13 July 1682. Of his compositional production, extensive as it would be expected from a mestre de capella, a minimum of 74 different compositions have been preserved, distributed mainly in six archives: in the Library of Catalonia, in the cathedrals of Girona and Zaragoza, in the chapel of the Real Colegio Seminario del Corpus Christi, in Valencia, and the churches of and .

Upon arrival, firefighters found no signs of fire, but upon further investigating the alarm cause, found what appeared to be a refrigerant leak. At around 4:30pm, the 400kg of propane-based refrigerant ignited explosively, injuring all eight firefighters and destroying one fire engine. One firefighter, Senior Station Officer Derek Lovell, later died in hospital as a result of his injuries, and another firefighter received burns to 71 percent of his body. $25 million worth of cheese was in the coolstores at the time, which melted in the fire and covered neighbouring homes. Following the fire, Icepak Coolstores and the refrigeration company contracted to maintain the coolstores pleaded guilty to health and safety breaches, and combined were ordered to pay $393,000 in fines and reparation.

His areas of expertise included Sir Francis Drake, Drake's New Albion claim, Chinese porcelain, the Kriegsmarine , and Manila galleon history, and he was also the director of the Treasure Island Museum. Personal life Edward Paul Von der Porten was born in New York City on October 29, 1933 and died in San Francisco on April 9, 2018, of strokes. His father was a banker, and when Von der Porten graduated from Stuyvesant High School, the family moved to San Francisco. At San Francisco State College (now San Francisco State University), he earned his bachelor of arts degree in 1955. While attending post-graduate school at San Francisco State, he researched the German World War II navy, the Kriegsmarine, and in 1965 was awarded a master of arts degree. Von der Porten earned his teaching credential and first taught at taught at Washington High School (Fremont, California). He later taught at Cook Middle School. Most of his career, he taught at Santa Rosa High School. Von der Porten also developed the program and taught archaeology at Santa Rosa Junior College (SRJC). While in college, Von der Porten met Saryl Corrick and they were married in 1954. They had two sons. Career Von der Porten both taught archaeology and founded the field archaeology program at SRJC. With the college, he did extensive archaeological field work regarding the protohistory of the area of what is now Point Reyes National Seashore, near Drakes Bay, California. In the fall of 1961, Von der Porten and 21 of his Santa Rosa Junior College students excavated four sites that had been previously identified by the Drake Navigators Guild (DNG). These sites were sites which he had previously investigated on behalf of—and while operating—as a member of the DNG. In 1962, he led a team of SJRC 23 students who further investigated DNG sites in Marin County and two other locations on the Sonoma Coast near the old Russian colony, Fort Ross. Later, SJRC continued the archaeology studies at Point Reyes National Seashore by including other instructors. Maritime historian Barry Gough writes about Von der Porten: ‘’He was an American pioneer in writing the German naval history of the Second World War. . . .” For the book, Von der Porten interviewed numerous German naval officers including Großadmiral Karl Dönitz who authored and signed the book's forward. The book, first published in 1969 was again published in an expanded pictorial edition in 1976. Von der Porten' last book, the posthumously published Ghost Galleon, describes the 16th century Manila galleon wreck off Baja California, the San Juanillo. Von der Porten investigated 16th century maritime history at Drakes Bay and Point Reyes, particularly with respect to Chinese porcelains. Clarence Shangraw of San Francisco's Asian Art Museum and Von der Porten studied the archived porcelain sherds and distinguished two different cargoes: one from Francis Drake Golden Hind anchorage in 1579 and another from Sebastián Cermeño's 1595 San Agustin shipwreck. His work—primarily as an officer of the Drake Navigators Guild—was instrumental in the recognition as Drakes Bay becoming a National Historic Landmark acknowledging the place where Francis Drake careened his ship. Von der Porten investigated and wrote regarding the mystery of Drake's Plate of Brass hoax. He often cautioned about the insufficient utility of the plate as an artifact by saying, \\"Such a lone find is nearly meaningless in the nature of archaeological evidence.\\" Von der Porten’ was the manager of the Treasure Island Museum, and he developed the museum and shop aboard the Jeremiah O’Brien Liberty Ship, currently berthed in San Francisco. He was also consulting displays curator for the Sonoma County Museum and worked with the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City. Among the conferences at which Von der Porten presented were those held by the Center For Scientific Research in Canada and at conferences of the Society for the History of Discoveries and The North American Society for Oceanic History. He was also a consultant for the National Geographic regarding the Hanseatic League and did significant research about Henry VIII’s Mary Rose and the development of big gun sailing ships. Books  Von der Porten wrote several books and almost 100 scholarly articles about maritime matters.

They can be contrasted with mainstream cinemas (often multiplexes), which are more likely to screen blockbusters and other popular films. Indie cinemas are often characterized by their smaller size and stronger ties to their local communities. Many are also located in historic or nontraditional venues. Unlike mainstream cinemas, which almost exclusively draw patrons looking to see a particular film and make no tacit endorsement of the films they screen, indie cinemas often work to cultivate a reputation for good taste by curating a selection of high-quality films, thus drawing patrons who might know little about a film before going to see it. History In the silent cinema era, most cinemas were independent. In the 1930s, as talkies requiring more sophisticated equipment arose, many smaller cinemas were unable to compete with larger chains. The 1948 United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. Supreme Court case, which blocked movie studios from also owning cinemas, led to a resurgence of indie cinemas starting in the 1950s. In the 1980s, loosened vertical integration restrictions helped reverse this trend. Like all movie theaters, indie cinemas have been financially threatened in the 21st century by the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix. Some have converted to become nonprofits. By region =United States= In the United States, the largest indie cinema chain is Landmark Theatres.

Overview  After Ike Turner's ex-wife Tina Turner revealed that his violent behavior and infidelity drove her to attempt suicide in her 1986 autobiography, I,Tina: My Life Story (dramatized in the 1993 film What's Love Got to Do with It), he became a social pariah whose personal life overshadowed his musical contributions. In Takin' Back My Name, Turner tells his story from his childhood through the pinnacle of his career with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue, his cocaine-fueled downfall, and his career revival in the 1990s.  Narrative  Takin' Back My Name begins with an introduction by musician Little Richard who emphasizes Ike Turner's influence as a rock 'n' roll pioneer. Turner then recounts his life woven with inner thoughts and newfound perspectives. Izear Luster Turner, better known as \\"Ike Turner,\\" was born in Clarksdale, Mississippi. Early in his musical career, he worked for the Los Angeles-based Bihari brothers as an A&R; man at Modern Records, scouting the Delta blues scene in search of artists to record. With his own band the Kings of Rhythm, Turner recorded \\"Rocket 88,\\" a distorted-guitar ode to the Oldsmobile 88, which is credited as being the first rock ‘n’ roll record, at Sam Phillips’ Memphis recording studio in 1951. Instead of Turner's name on the record, his saxophonist (and vocalist on the track) Jackie Brenston was credited. He then worked as a talent scout and session musician at Sun Records. In 1954, Turner relocated his band to East St. Louis, Illinois. There he met Ann Bullock who joined his band. He called her \\"Little Ann\\" and he eventually created her stage name Tina Turner. He formed the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 1960 which was followed by a string of hit records and relentless touring in the 1960s. At the peak of their commercial success in the early 1970s, they toured internationally and had their own recording studio, Bolic Sound, which became Turner's playground strife with explicit tales of sex and cocaine use. By the mid 1970s, the Turners' relationship was deteriorating and after a physical altercation in 1976, they divorced in 1978. In 1986, after culminating her comeback, Tina Turner released her autobiography I, Tina, which was filled with allegations of spousal abuse. At the time, Turner was own a downward spiral which ended with an 18-month stint in prison for drug possession. After his release in the early 1990s, Tina's book was adapted into the film What’s Love Got To Do With It. Laurence Fishburne's menacing portrayal of Turner in the film and the fabrications in the script further damaged Turners reputation. Despite this, Turner reformed a new Revue and after a long absence from the stage he resumed performing.  Critical reception  Reviewing the book for The Guardian, Caroline Sullivan wrote: \\"Takin' Back My Name is one of the few celebrity memoirs unbelaboured by excuses for bad behaviour. Admirably, Turner refuses to blame anyone but himself for a life of excess that began at the age of six when he was seduced by a certain Miss Boozie in Clarksdale.\\" Glyn Brown wrote for The Independent: \\"In it, he comes over as an egotist just doing the best he can in difficult circumstances and, though you wonder if it's maybe 100 per cent unreliable, Ike's an old man now, and he deserves a break. Problem is, Ike doesn't really help himself.\\"  References  Category:Ike Turner Category:African-American autobiographies Category:Music autobiographies Category:Show business memoirs Category:1999 non-fiction books Category:American autobiographies Category:Books about pop music Category:Books about rock music Category:Books about men Category:Books about musicians Category:Books about singers Category:Literary collaborations Category:Virgin Books books Category:Books by Nigel Cawthorne ","title":"Takin' Back My Name"},{"id":"61846315","text":"Alexandrovka () is a rural locality (a settlement) in Alexeyevsky Selsoviet, Blagoveshchensky District, Altai Krai, Russia.

Synopsis Dozens of disjointed images flow one after the other: the mind of God reviewing human activities, anxiously considering the nightmare possibility of becoming trapped in his own creation as an everyman. Themes Ostensibly, Daniel Cockburn explores the \\"murky world of dream logic\\", \\"the stuff of dreams and nightmares\\", by means of a meditative collage of \\"iconic and esoteric movie clips ... artfully set to the measured but troubled reflections\\" of God. However, as Calum Marsh notes, the film technique is also a way \\"to think about how movies work\\", and in that sense God's Nightmares may be seen as a follow-up to the director's 2017 film, The Argument (with annotations). Production =Background= In 2017, the same year he completed his York University master's thesis film, The Argument (with annotations), Cockburn began an artist-in-residency and a research fellowship at the Queen Mary University of London's School of Languages, Linguistics and Film in its pilot year. Both The Argument and God's Nightmares are considered Canadian-British co-productions. =Financing= In the introduction to his review of God's Nightmares, Marsh notes appreciatively that Telefilm Canada and other funding bodies in recent years \\"have completely redefined how money is awarded to filmmakers across the country\\", choosing to support dozens of different projects \\"instead of bankrolling two- or three-million-dollar epics by washed-up directors who have been phoning it in since middle age\\", representing \\"a shake-up that is already transforming the landscape of Canadian film in a fundamental way.\\" It has been reported that Cockburn's project had a budget of $300,000. =Editing= Cockburn's film relies almost exclusively on \\"a few dozen carefully curated film clips,\\" the same collage technique he made use of in the first half of The Argument and in his early short film work. Release and reception God's Nightmares had its world premiere at the 44th Toronto International Film Festival on 8 September 2019 in the Short Cuts Programme, and its U.S. premiere shortly thereafter at Fantastic Fest on 22 September 2019. =Critical response= Writing for Now following the film's premiere at Toronto, Norman Wilner placed it at the top of his list of best ten short films at the festival, Wilner calls the film a video essay. God's Nightmares likewise makes it on to Calum Marsh's list of top six short films at the festival, and he also calls Cockburn \\"one of Canada's preeminent film essayists\\" whose \\"odd, often beguiling experiments with sound and image display an extraordinarily rich familiarity with cinema history and, more than anything else, a profound love of motion pictures.\\" > God's Nightmares, his latest short, follows up on the sly metacommentary of > 2017's The Argument (With Annotations), again using found footage from a > huge range of movies . , and over the course of its brief running time, > Cockburn draws surprising connections, finds intriguing parallels, and makes > observations that qualify as bona fide film criticism, all tied together > with a meditative narration that playfully muses about the thoughts and > fixations of the Almighty. Victor Stiff compares God's Nightmares to the \\"unsettling\\" films of David Lynch, saying the clips such as Halloween and After Hours induce anxiety through the \\"strange visual collage\\".

His career spanned for more than five decades; de Silva has contributed to the field of zoology with much research and numerous publications particularly on crocodiles, snakes and lizards. De Silva is known for conservation of crocodiles in Sri Lanka. He is the regional chairman of the Crocodile Specialists Group of the IUCN, South Asia and Iran. Personal life He was born on 1 August 1940 in Matara. He completed education from St. Servatius College, Matara. Before entering the field of biology, de Silva was a renowned magician. He won two national awards at All Island Magic Competition and conducted massive shows from Matara to Jaffna. He also published 22 papers on magic. His son Panduka de Silva is also a naturalist where he worked in Andaman Islands on crocodiles. Career While at the school, he rescued a rat snake, which led him to move further in field of science. Then he started to rear few non-poisonous snakes, a baby saltwater crocodile, and a few sea turtles in his home, and villagers started calling him Hoony Mahaththaya (Mr Gecko) due to his frequent outings around the village to catch geckos as a food for snakes. At the age of 17, he read the book Snakes of Ceylon written by Frank Wall which induced him to start researching snakes throughout the country. In 1964, he joined Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya, as the museum technician of the Department of Public Health. He retired from Department of Community Medicine in 2000. He is the founder and president of Amphibia and Reptile Research Organisation of Sri Lanka (ARROS), which he started in 1990. ARROS is the first NGO in Sri Lanka aimed at reptile conservation. Due to his enormous contribution, de Silva was appointed as the chairman for Declining Amphibian Populations Task Force in the World Conservation Union (now the IUCN) for Sri Lanka. In 2015, he worked as the co-chairman of the Amphibian Specialist Group of the World Conservation Union. He published more than 450 research publications on herpetofauna in Sri Lanka for last 50 years. He is the first author to publish a reptile guide with colored photographs. To create public awareness of reptiles and amphibians, de Silva published the Sri Lanka's first series of posters illustrated with colored photographs in 1990 and 2001. De Silva organised many events at 4th World Herpetology Congress and World Crocodile Congress. In 1991, University of Peradeniya conferred a Master of Science degree for his contributions to the field of zoology.

Most of his works are landscapes and still-lifes.  Biography  He was born in Barcelona, where his father was working as a watchmaker and goldsmith. In 1893, his family returned to their hometown of Schramberg. He later completed an apprenticeship at the carpentry school in Nürnberg, then attended the State Academy of Fine Arts Stuttgart where he studied with Bernhard Pankok. Upon graduating, he joined the school's staff. Around 1910, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis and moved to Davos, a spa town in Switzerland, where he became friends with the writers Klabund and . The surroundings of the Swiss Alps and his illness inspired him to create works dealing with mountains, landscapes, villages, ice skating, hiking, rural life, illness and death.Monika Köhler: Die Neuentdeckung eines Pioniers. In: Südkurier vom 29. April 2014. Even though his health improved, he refused to return to Germany, as he was opposed to the war. He apparently lived very poorly, in a log cabin, and the proceeds from his first exhibition were seized to pay off debts. During this time, he became severely misanthropic; satirizing the people of Davos and the guests who came there to visit the spa. In 1917, one of those guests was the famous artist, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner. At first, they were friends, but slowly became enemies. Bauknecht accused him of being unable to paint unless he was drunk and rejected the idea that Kirchner had influenced him. After 1920, until his death, he exhibited his paintings and woodcuts widely throughout Switzerland and Germany. In 1925, he married the wealthy Ada van Blommestein, from the Netherlands, and travelled with her there. They had one son. Although he was now financially secure, his health began to deteriorate, so he returned to Davos and died there in 1933, while having an operation for gastric cancer. Ada took his remaining works to Baarn, in the Netherlands, and hid them from the Nazis.Bauknecht. Im Versteck. Malerei. In: Der Spiegel 34/1961 vom 16. August 1961 In Germany, his paintings were declared \\"degenerate art\\" and some were displayed at the Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich in 1937. Most of his work there was eventually destroyed or lost. It wasn't until 1960 that his works were rediscovered and reevaluated.Gerd Presler: Philipp Bauknecht.

In September 2019 her credentials came under scrutiny after allegations of misrepresentation. This resulted in several Greek and international media investigating her claims, which have been proven to be false or, in some cases, exaggerated.  Background  = Early life and education = Eleni Antoniadou was born in Thessaloniki, Greece in 1988. She studied Biomedicine at the University of Central Greece and received a Master's degree in Nanotechnology and Regenerative Medicine from University College London. = Career = She has been reported as being a scientist active in the fields of regenerative medicine, artificial organ bioengineering and space medicine. Antoniadou co-founded a company called Transplants without Donors. In 2014, she was included in the BBC's 100 Women, and in 2015 in Forbes 30 amazing women under 30. In 2016 she served as president of the 2nd regular annual convention of the European Health Parliament, which describes itself as a multidisciplinary movement to suggest solutions for health to the European Union policymakers. Toy maker Mattel produced a special edition Barbie doll with Antoniadou's image as part of their 60th anniversary Role Models series. The replica was the first time a Barbie doll portrayed a woman from Greece. The production of the doll was cancelled after allegations of misrepresentation surfaced in 2019. = Criticism = After a commendation by the Minister of Education Niki Kerameus in 2019, scientists raised concerns that Greek media may not have verified her academic credentials and that she may have misrepresented her achievements. Greek Wikipedia later modified its article on Antoniadou after the misrepresentations were revealed, and Greek think tank Dianeosis (διαΝΕΟσις) removed her from their advisory committee. According to the website 'Greek Hoaxes', the claim that she is \\"the scientist who made the world's first artificial trachea from stem cells that were successfully transplanted into a patient\\" is untrue, as the recipient passed away just 18 months after the operation, while the surgeon who performed it, Paolo Macchiarini, was heavily criticized for wrong medical practices and fired from the Karolinska Institute where he worked. Antoniadou's name was absent from the scientific publication concerning both the construction of the trachea and the operation. A few months after the death of the patient, Antoniadou appeared in interviews and incorrectly stated that the patient survived. The publication in the Journal of Biomedical Materials Research is now retracted.William Kremer, \\"Paolo Macchiarini: A surgeon’s downfall\\", BBC World Service, 10 September 2016 Despite the relevant reports and her resume, Antoniadou did not work directly for NASA nor did she participate in astronaut training, as reported in an interview, but instead participated in a short- lived space clothing experiment. The claim that she received the NASA-ESA Outstanding Researcher Award in 2012 is not confirmed. According to NASA Johns Hopkins University space scientist Stamatis Krimizis, NASA and ESA have only separate awards. It also does not have a name on NASA's list of recipient awards until 2012. A BBC publication heavily criticised Greek media and their role, which, while conducting several interviews with Antoniadou, did not verify or factcheck whether what was attributed to her was correct. The BBC itself had earlier included her in the 100 Women of 2014.\\"Who are the 100 Women 2014?\\", BBC, 26 October 2014: \\"Eleni Antoniadou Co-Founder Transplants Without Donors @eleni_nasa\\" The European People's Party included her in a Twitter post as one of the 11 most important Greeks of the twentieth century.

Biography  He was born in a poor peasant family in Căciulești, Neamț County, Kingdom of Romania. He fought in World War I and the Hungarian–Romanian War and reached the rank of Major. In 1921 he was admitted to the Military Academy and by 1940 he had reached the rank of Major-General. He commanded the 25th Division (August 1939) and the 20th Division (June 1940), and 8 days after the start of Operation Barbarossa, he took over the command of the 21st Division. With his Division, he fought bloody battles against the Soviets, including the Battle of Țiganca in Bessarabia and the Siege of Odessa (1941). Dăscălescu had distinguished himself and was promoted to lead the 2nd Romanian Corps, which was part of in the Third Army. His Corps was present at the Battle of Stalingrad and was overrun by numerical superior forces during Operation Uranus. The remnants of the Corps were withdrawn to Romania to be rebuilt and to protect the northern border. After King Michael's Coup on 23 August 1944, the 2nd Corps turned against its former German allies, took 10,500 prisoners, and participated in the advance in Transylvania as part of the Fourth Army under command of Gheorghe Avramescu. He temporarily replaced Avramescu at the head of the Army, when he was dismissed in January–February 1945. He became the new commander of the Fourth Army on 3 March, when Avramescu was eliminated by the NKVD. With the Fourth Army, he fought in the Bratislava–Brno Offensive and the Prague Offensive. At the end of the War, Dăscălescu was relieved of command and retired. In 1946, he was put on trial as a war criminal, but the court dismissed the accusations and cleared his name. Not a friend of the new Communist regime, he was further harassed until 1951, when he was thrown in the Jilava prison for \\"agricultural sabotage\\". He was released in October 1955, and moved to Piatra Neamț. He lived the rest of his years away from public life, despite being promoted to lieutenant general.

In 1955 he became the first African American to attain the rank of Captain with a commercial airline, and the first black airline pilot in the United States.  Education and career  Captain August \\"Augie\\" Harvey Martin was born in Los Angeles, California in 1919. His mother was a professional schoolteacher who taught him at home until the age of 13. In 1938 he graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, Bronx after the family had moved to New York. He later moved back to California to attend San Mateo Junior College during which period he financed his first flying lessons, making his first solo flight in January 1940. He attended the University of California Civilian Pilot Training Programme for further flight training and acquired his flight instructor rating. In 1942 he worked for the Navy V-12 Programme at Cornell University before joining the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1943. He was sent to Tuskeegee Alabama for flight training, where he was awarded his wings in September 1945. He was honorably discharged from the military in 1946 and attempted to find a job as a commercial airline pilot but such jobs were not easily available to African Americans at that time. He continued supporting his family with odd jobs, aircraft maintenance and part time flying jobs until 1955 when he was employed by Seaboard World Airlines as a Captain, thus becoming the first African American to hold that post with a scheduled U.S. airline. He was a founding member of Negro Airmen International in 1967. During his time with Seaboard, he piloted DC-3, DC-4, Lockheed Constellation and Canadair CL-44 planes. Captain Martin undertook numerous humanitarian aid flights to Africa in his spare time and was part of the Biafran airlift operations. On 30.07.1968, while on leave from Seaboard World Airlines, Captain Martin volunteered to fly food and relief material in a mercy mission into the embattled and starved stronghold enclave of Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War. While attempting to land his Lockheed L‑1049G Super Constellation on the Uli jungle airstrip at night, during a tropical storm, he was killed in a fatal crash. Also killed in the accident were his wife, actress Gladys Frank Riddle Martin as well as two representatives of the International Red Cross.

The tomb, built in two phases coinciding with its two steps, was originally known as the fourth pyramid of Giza. In the first phase, a nearly square block of bedrock, around which the stone had been quarried for the Giza pyramids, was utilized to construct her tomb and encased with fine white Tura limestone. In the second phase, most likely in the Fifth Dynasty, her tomb was enlarged with a large limestone structure built on top of the bedrock block. The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner suggests that this may have been intended to convert her tomb into a pyramid, but was abandoned as a result of stability concerns. South-west of the tomb was a long boat pit, which housed the Night boat of Re. A companion day boat has not been found. A chapel was built into the tomb superstructure, with a large granite entrance bearing the queen's name and titles. One of her titles was of particular interest because it had not previously been known. The chapel connected to a three niched statuary room to its west, and a long hall to its north. The hall to the north housed two pink granite false doors, below one of which was a sloped passage into the tomb substructure comprising an antechamber and a burial chamber bisected in two. In the east half of the burial chamber were entrances to six storage magazines, and two more pink granite false doors in its west wall. The west half of the chamber was once occupied by a large alabaster sarcophagus, fragments of which constituted the only significant finds by Selim Hassan. Carved into the north wall was a shelf which once stored the canopic jars of the burial. A small square niche had been cut into the south wall. A settlement was built around her tomb, and likely occupied by priests of her mortuary cult until the end of the Sixth Dynasty. The settlement was bounded to the north and south by long perimeter walls running east then south. Along a causeway leading from the chapel through the town, ten carefully planned homes were built, suggesting that the town was designed and not the result of natural urban development. The town was further outfitted with granaries and a large water tank. To the south-west were Menkaure's valley temple, and an annex described by Hassan as Khentkaus' valley temple.  Location and excavation  alt=Map of a complex The tomb, located on the Giza Plateau, was originally believed by some Egyptologists to be a \\"fourth pyramid of Giza\\". It was identified as a pyramid by John Shae Perring and Colonel Howard Vyse who visited the site in 1837–1838. The site was visited the following year by Karl Richard Lepsius, on sponsorship from King Frederick William IV of Prussia. He believed the tomb was a private one, and designated it 100 on his map. In 1912, Uvo Hölscher identified the structure as \\"the unfinished pyramid of Shepseskaf\\". George Andrew Reisner identified it as a king's pyramid, believing it to be an incomplete construction of Shepseskaf, in Mycerinus, the temples of the third pyramid at Giza (1931). In 1932, Selim Hassan was able to demonstrate that the tomb belonged to Khentkaus I. The name and titles of the queen were found inscribed on blocks of red granite from the doorjambs of the chapel. Hers was the last royal monument built on the plateau.  Mortuary complex  = Superstructure = alt=Photograph of a tomb The tomb has a two- stepped superstructure, which can not properly be classified either as a mastaba or as a pyramid. Selim Hassan compared it to Djoser's step pyramid, which had a square base in its early development, to favour a pyramid designation. The lower step is nearly square in shape and has dimensions by with a height of . This step had a north-south orientation, and was cut into bedrock – reserved for the tomb whilst the stone around it was quarried for the Giza Pyramids – and encased in fine white Tura limestone with a given slope of about 74°. The casing was well preserved on the west and north faces, but near totally destroyed on the south face. At this time, it had the appearance of a truncated pyramid, and was adorned on all four sides with niches resembling false doors, in the motif of the palace façade. Most likely in the first half of the Fifth Dynasty of Egypt, Khentkaus' tomb was significantly altered and a second step, constructed entirely of limestone, built over the west half of the superstructure. The structure was composed of seven courses of locally quarried limestone, with blocks larger than those used in the construction of Khufu's pyramid, but becoming gradually smaller towards the top. The displacement was intentional, as the structure's weight might have collapsed the tomb altogether had it been centered. The step is mastaba-like having dimensions of by with a height of , and was slightly vaulted, in a fashion similar to Shepseskaf's mastaba. Overall, the structure was tall, and was fully encased in white Tura limestone. The Egyptologist Miroslav Verner believes this expansion was intended to convert the tomb into a full pyramid, possibly up to three steps high, but that concern over the tomb's stability prevented its construction. The tomb was enclosed on three sides – north, west, and south – by a thick, whitewashed mudbrick perimeter wall. The south wall starts with a bend at the edge of the solar boat pit, runs for along the entire east wall, and then along the north wall for terminating at the southern jamb of the courtyard entrance. The east side had a high wall cut into the rock, which formed a chamber with the pyramid where the queen was embalmed. The expansion project appears to coincide with an elevation in the status of Khentkaus I. She had a title that had not previously been found anywhere else in ancient Egypt, which has been interpreted as either \\"Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" or \\"King of Upper and Lower Egypt, and Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\". It appears that her monument was constructed by her sons, speculatively proposed to be Shepseskaf and Userkaf. -M23*L2:X1*X1-M23*L2:X1*X1-G14-R8-G39:X1-I10:D46:X1-Aa1*X1:V30-F35-D21:X1-D4-X1:N35-S29-W17:X1-D28*D28:D28*S29- = Causeway = A covered causeway, composed of three parallel walls, led from the valley to a chapel, situated on the south-east side of the tomb. Originally, the north causeway wall and the south perimeter wall left a passage wide. This was later split into two with the construction of a southern causeway wall which left a causeway passage around wide and a southern street passage around wide. The southern perimeter wall was dismantled, either naturally or from human interference, and later rebuilt. The original construction was made of large mudbrick brick of dark silt, the rebuild was made of small mudbricks of sandy silt, cased with limestone chips. = Chapel = The chapel has a paved courtyard in front of it, and is entered through a large pink granite gate – its southern jamb measured wide by tall – which bear Khentkaus I's name and titles. Although both jambs were severely damaged by stone thieves, their inscription has been preserved, along with an image of the queen wearing a wig, robe and Vulture crown, seated on a chair, with her right hand placed on her thigh, and her left resting on her chest. The entrance, recessed deep into the superstructure bedrock, led into the chapel, by , paved and lined with fine white Tura limestone. To the west was a three niched statuary room, lined with fine white limestone and decorated with bas-relief scenes and inscriptions. To the north was a second chamber, by , entered through a black granite doorway. It housed two pink granite false doors in its west wall, below one was a shaft which led into the substructure. = Substructure = The substructure of the tomb bears semblance to both a private and a royal tomb. It was accessed though a long, wide, granite paved and lined, down-sloped passage terminating at an antechamber. The burial chamber was split into two halves. The eastern chamber was long, wide, and high. In its east and south walls were six storage rooms, with entrance passages generally by , and cells between and deep, wide, and high. On the west wall of the chamber are two more false doors, tall and wide, that had been cut into the wall, and likely cased in high quality stone. The western chamber, by , contained the sarcophagus of the queen, along with a square niche to the south and a rock-carved shelf, which likely stored canopic jars, to the north. Most of the western chamber was occupied by a by depression cut into the ground. The only significant remains of the burial that Selim Hassan discovered were fragments of an alabaster sarcophagus, along with a brown limestone scarab from the Twelfth Dynasty. Khentkaus tomb plan.pngalt=Layout drawing of a tombLayout of the interior of Khentkaus I's tomb Khentkaus I tomb Giza.pngalt=Cross-sectional drawing of a tombInterior and exterior structure of Khentkaus I's tomb = Solar barque = Situated at the south- west corner of the tomb, is an east-west oriented, long and deep boat pit. The walls of this pit were built of mortared rubble. It contained a vessel with an upraised prow and stern. Based on findings of white limestone and black granite blocks, Hassan concluded that the ship was roofed, and therefore the night boat of Re for passage through the Duat. A corresponding day barque was not found, but may be located on the west side of the tomb.  Pyramid town  An L-shaped settlement of mudbrick houses was built in a linear fashion east and south of the tomb, and enclosed by a perimeter wall. The south perimeter wall runs east for from the courtyard doorjamb, turns south for , before bending back to the east after which the wall is lost under a cemetery. The north wall starts from the other courtyard doorjamb, runs east for , turns south for , continues east for a further , before a final turn south where it too is lost under the cemetery. The two walls form the boundary of the pyramid town of Khentkaus' complex. The pyramid town was carefully planned by architects for Khentkaus I's complex, rather than resulting from natural urban development, and was built entirely from mudbrick. Ten houses were lined eastwards against the causeway, and split into two groups. The first six homes each had two entrances – north leading to a street, and south leading to the causeway – a porter's lobby, a reception, a living room, two bedrooms, an open court, a kitchen, a water reservoir and a domestic office. Minor deviations existed between homes, such as a granary occupying the kitchen of one house and the reception area of another, but they otherwise conformed to this standard plan. The remaining four have a similar plan, but omit the porter's lobby and reception room, and the final of these homes is separated from the preceding three by an intersecting, north-south oriented street. In Hassan's opinion, the priests of the Queen's mortuary cult occupied the lodgings, tending to the cult until the end of the Sixth Dynasty. Lehner et al. (2011) suggest that, although concrete evidence is lacking, the occupants of the southern homes of the town may have served either or both Khentkaus' and Menkaure's mortuary cults. Despite this, the layout and orientation of Menkaure's and Khentkaus' structures suggest a separation between their monuments and estates. There was originally a limestone double-leaved door where the street intersected with the perimeter wall, and it was outfitted with a subway passing under the causeway. The subway was cut into the bedrock to a maximum depth of and had a passageway wide. Thirteen steps were cut into the north side, but the less steep south side was left smooth. The passage was not completed, as evidenced by bulges left at the bottom of the subway, and may have had limited utility to the town dwellers. The street, wide, continues south for to an intersection with an east-west running street. Here another double-leaved door originally stood. To the west, a staircase led to the granaries, and separated by a mudbrick wall to the north, a massive by water tank. The granaries were tucked behind a thin retaining wall, beyond which was a courtyard and two long narrow rooms. From the granary courtyard a passage leads south to a T-shaped court with two storage rooms, and further south to a large home, likely the abode of the official in charge of the granaries. Near the west end of the southern lodgings was a house with thicker walls, suggesting that it held some particular significance, possibly even as a token palace. Due south-west of it, merged into Menkaure's valley temple and pyramid town, was a building labelled by Hassan as Khentkaus I's valley temple.  Valley temple  According to Hassan, Khentkaus' valley temple was accessed by a long \\"wide, brick-paved causeway\\" which passed between the south perimeter wall of the pyramid town and the north wall of the temple, and continued along the entirety of the east face of Menkaure's valley temple. The archaeologist Barry Kemp identifies the temple as an annex of Menkaure's valley temple, and the vestibule as a second gatehouse. Inside a storage room, Hassan uncovered a fragment of an alabaster offering table which bore the partial inscription \\"... her father, king's daughter\\", and hieroglyphs which Hassan interpreted as being the tripe Ka hieroglyph of Khentkaus' name. The Egyptologist Mark Lehner concedes that this is a very plausible reading, but not entirely certain, and does not prove that the temple itself was built for Khentkaus. During excavations between 2005 and 2009, Hassan's \\"wide, brick-paved causeway\\" was revealed to be an ascending ramp. The ramp does not appear to interface with Khentkaus' causeway, which itself traverses east-west and has no identifiable deviation to the south. The most direct identifiable path from her pyramid town to this ramp would be via an exit in the south-east corner of her town, an area which has not yet been cleared. The main entrance to the temple is on the north side – highly atypical, as a valley temple is usually entered from the east, but this may have been impractical owing the possible presence of buildings on that side – underneath a portico supported by twin columns. The portico had a limestone paved floor, whitewashed walls, and limestone bases which held the two columns. The bases have been retained, but the columns themselves – possibly manufactured from wood – have not been preserved. The remains of a diorite statue of Khafre were found near the doorway of the temple, brought here at some later time. Through the doorway lay a vestibule with a roof supported by four columns. The column's bases built of alabaster were found in situ, but the columns they held have been lost. The walls were given simple colour washes: whitewash in the upper section, and black for the dado with a red upper trim. A limestone incense burner, and fragments of two schist statuettes, one belonging to a king and the other in the form of a sphinx, were found inside the vestibule, along with several other objects. To the south, a doorway led into the court. The court, measuring by , was paved with mudbrick save for a limestone pathway leading south-west from the doorway, under the wall, and into the vestibule of Menkaure's temple. There was originally a doorway into the temple, but this was bricked up during the construction of Khentkaus' temple. North-west of the courtyard was an elongated storage room, and to the east a long corridor with two, later three, entrances. The corridor was converted into a set of three dwellings, as was the southern half of the temple beyond the court. North-west of the valley temple was a rectangular by mudbrick building, called the \\"Washing-tent\\" by Hassan. The building was used in the purification process before Khentkaus' corpse was transported through the necropolis to the embalming house. The chamber was found filled with debris, containing copious fragments of stone vessels, potsherds, and flint instruments. A covered, sloped white limestone drain was carved into the floor of the chamber, leading north for where it terminated into a large stepped basin. The first two steps of the basin were constructed from mudbrick, with the top step measuring by . The third, and bottom, step was built from limestone and measured by .

The Irish Language Act () is proposed legislation in Northern Ireland that would give the Irish language equal status to English in the region, similar to that of the Welsh language in Wales under the Welsh Language Act 1993. It is supported by the Republic of Ireland, Sinn Féin, SDLP, the Alliance Party, and the Green Party, and opposed by the Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party. Sinn Féin and POBAL, the Northern Irish association of Irish speakers, say that the act was promised to them in the 2006 St Andrews Agreement. Unionists say that prior commitments have already been honoured. As part of the New Decade, New Approach compromise agreement, many of the proposals sought under an Irish Language Act were implemented by amending existing laws rather than introducing a new standalone law. Background About 184,898 (10.65%) Northern Irish people claim some knowledge of Irish, while about 4,130 (0.2%) speak it as their main home language. Currently, the status of the Irish language is guaranteed by the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, which will continue to bind the United Kingdom after Brexit. Since 2008, the Irish republican party Sinn Féin has been advocating that these protections be strengthened by legislation. Potential contents According to TheJournal.ie, the legislation sought by Sinn Féin would also appoint an Irish language commissioner and designate Gaeltacht areas. It would also provide for the right to use Irish: *In the judicial system * In the Northern Ireland Assembly (Stormont) *With public sector services *In Irish-medium education *On bilingual signage Conradh na Gaeilge (an all-island non-political social and cultural organisation which promotes the language in Ireland and worldwide) proposes an Act that would provide for * the Official status of the language; * Irish in the Assembly; * Irish in Local Government; * Irish and the BBC; * Irish in the Department of Education; * the role of a Language Commissioner; and * placenames. Other proposals have included replicating the Welsh or the Scottish Act. Support and opposition Irish language activist and unionist Linda Ervine stated that she had come to support the legislation after comments by Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MLA Gregory Campbell mocking the Irish language. She said that the act would have little effect on non-Irish speakers and that some politicians had engaged in \\"scaremongering\\". When a draft bill was leaked after talks stalled in 2018, Irish language groups criticized the legislation for not going far enough, specifically in not creating new rights for Irish speakers. Meanwhile, DUP supporters condemned the compromise legislation. In 2017, pressure group An Dream Dearg organized a rally in favour of the act in Belfast, attracting several thousand supporters. In May 2019, more than 200 prominent Irish people signed an open letter urging Republic of Ireland head of government Leo Varadkar and then-Prime Minister of the UK Theresa May to support the act. DUP leader Arlene Foster has stated that it would make more sense to pass a Polish Language Act than an Irish Language Act, because more Northern Ireland residents speak Polish than Irish. Her claim has been disputed by fact checkers. Foster also stated that \\"If you feed a crocodile they're going to keep coming back and looking for more\\" with regard to Sinn Féin's demands for the act and accused the party of \\"using the Irish language as a tool to beat Unionism over the head.\\" Role in political deadlock (2017–2020) In January 2017, Sinn Féin deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness resigned in protest over the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal, and the party declined to replace him. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing system, a government cannot be formed without both parties, and the Stormont Assembly was suspended. Gerry Adams, then Sinn Féin leader, stated in August 2017 that \\"There won't be an assembly without an Acht na Gaeilge.\\" According to The Independent in 2019, the Irish Language Act has become the most public issue of disagreement in discussions about restoring Stormont, and it is \\"almost certainly\\" required for a deal to be made to end the deadlock. Compromise (2020) On 11 January 2020, Sinn Féin and the DUP re-entered devolved government under the New Decade, New Approach agreement with DUP leader Arlene Foster appointed Northern Ireland's first minister, and Sinn Féin's Michelle O'Neill appointed deputy first minister. As part of the agreement, there will be no standalone Irish Language Act, but the Northern Ireland Act 1998 will be amended and policies implemented to: *grant official status to both the Irish language and Ulster Scots language in Northern Ireland; *establish the post of Irish Language Commissioner to \\"recognise, support, protect and enhance the development of the Irish language in Northern Ireland\\" as part of a new Office of Identity and Cultural Expression (alongside an Ulster Scots/Ulster British Commissioner); *introduce sliding- scale \\"language standards\\", a similar approach to that taken for the Welsh language in Wales, although they are subject to veto by the First Minister or deputy First Minister; *repeal a 1737 ban on the use of Irish in Northern Ireland's courts; * allow members of the Northern Ireland Assembly to speak in Irish or Ulster Scots, with simultaneous translation for non-speakers, and *establish a central translation unit within the Northern Ireland government.

It was called following the death of incumbent, Md Farid Md Rafik on 21 September 2019. The late Md Farid, a member from the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (BERSATU) of Pakatan Harapan (PH) was first elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Tanjung Piai in Johor defeating the then incumbent Wee Jeck Seng from the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) of Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition and Nordin Othman from the Pan-Malaysian Islamic Front (BERJASA), which contested under the Pan- Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) banner through the Gagasan Sejahtera with a slim majority of 524 votes in 2018 general election (GE14). He was then appointed as Deputy Minister in the Prime Minister's Department for National Unity and Social Well-being. The Election Commission (EC) had set the polling day for 16 November 2019, early voting on 12 November and nomination day on 2 November with a 14-day campaign period. The electoral roll in the parliamentary constituency to be used would be the one up to the second quarter of 2019 which was last updated on 23 September 2019 with a total of 52,986 voters made up of 52,698 ordinary voters, 280 early voters while 8 absentee voters (who are abroad). Tanjung Piai is a racially-mixed seat with 57% Malays, 42% Chinese and 1% Indian. The by-election, the ninth since GE14 will be the first for election in Malaysia in which 18-year-olds and above can contest in an election as a result of the new constitutional amendment. However, voters who haven't achieved 21-years-old aren't eligible to vote in this by-election. BN's Wee Jeck Seng had won the by-election by a landslide majority of 15,086 votes to return to be the MP for Tanjung Piai again but as an Opposition. BN had claimed 25,466 votes to wrest back the seat they lost in last GE14 from PH which only claimed 10,380 votes. Nomination PH deputy president and Johor state chairman Muhyiddin Yassin said the coalition will discuss on the strategy and candidate for the by-election in a meeting on 4 October. BERSATU was expected to decide the candidate to defend the seat for PH; with the full support of other PH component parties; National Trust Party (AMANAH), Democratic Action Party (DAP) and People's Justice Party (PKR) which had indicated their endorsements. Karmaine Sardini, the 66-year-old architect- businessman and Tanjung Piai BERSATU chief, who had lost to BN's Ahmad Maslan in the adjacent Pontian constituency by a slim majority in the GE14 was picked as the PH's candidate on 28 October. BN component parties were reported jostling for the seat soon after it was vacant. United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) said that it will discuss with other BN counterparts on the candidate for the by-election. MCA had also announced that they are ready to contest to wrest back the seat. BN and UMNO president Ahmad Zahid Hamidi anyway has hinted that UMNO might contest the by-election. Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC) has insisted that MCA should be retained to contest the seat instead of UMNO representing BN. BN had finally chose Wee Jeck Seng, the 55-year-old Tanjung Piai MCA chief and former two-term Tanjung Piai MP until he had lost narrowly to PH in GE14, as their candidate again to recapture the seat back in the by-election. President of Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (GERAKAN), Dominic Lau has confirmed that the party has decided contesting the by-election after sitting out the previous eight by-election. GERAKAN had named its deputy secretary general, Wendy Subramaniam, who is a 38-year-old lawyer of mixed Indian-Chinese parentage from Johor Bahru as their candidate for the by-election. It will be contesting using its own logo back again since 1969 and after it left the BN in 2018 which saw the coalition GE14 downfall. President of BERJASA which candidate had contested the last general election under the PAS ticket, Badhrulhisham Abdul Aziz had urged the BN to nominate a Malay-Muslim candidate based on the spirit of UMNO-PAS pact of Muafakat Nasional. It even offered to nominate a credible BERJASA Malay candidate for the by election. Following the lack of Malay candidate alternatives in the by- election, BERJASA has confirmed their candidacy for the by-election on their own ticket and their 56-year-old party president, Badhrulhisham Abdul Aziz as their candidate for the by-election PAS vice-president Mohd Amar Nik Abdullah had stated PAS will support BN candidate and its former secretary-general Mustafa Ali even proposed the MCA to contest the seat. PAS president Abdul Hadi Awang has reaffirmed its supports and commitments to campaign for BN even the candidate is from MCA despite the just inked Piagam Muafakat Nasional (National Cooperation Charter) of UMNO-PAS pact. President of Parti Bumiputera Perkasa Malaysia (PUTRA), Ibrahim Ali had initially said that PUTRA will field a candidate in Tanjung Piai if the contesting parties field non-Malay candidates. Somehow PUTRA decided not to contest the Tanjung Piai by-election as to focus on its preparations for the next general election. The Gabungan Teksi Se-Malaysia (GTSM) announced that they will field Shamsubahrin Ismail who is the Big Blue Taxi founder as an independent candidate in the by- election to represent the public transport community. Unfortunately, he did not file his nomination papers during Nomination Day as he suffered a heart attack and was replaced with a single mother, Faridah Aryani Abd Ghaffar. On Nomination Day, 6 candidates including PH's Karmaine, BN's Wee, GERAKAN's Wendy, BERJASA's Badhrulhisham and two independents – Ang Chuan Lock (key logo), 49, tuition centres operator and Faridah Aryani Abd Ghaffar (car logo), 45, a social auditor have registered and has set for a six-cornered fight in the Tanjung Piai polls.  Controversies and issues  UMNO and MCA had expressed their dissatisfaction over EC setting the by-election nomination and polling dates on 2 and 16 November respectively, which will coincide with earlier planned annual general meeting's (AGM) of both parties; MCA's on 2-3 November and UMNO's on 13-16 November. EC in expressing its regret had clarified it was not deliberate and was unavoidable because of the forthcoming Deepavali public holiday on 27 October. Both the parties had decided to defer their AGM to avoid clashing with the by-election crucial dates. DAP vice- chairperson M. Kulasegaran, who is also Human Resources Minister, in a statement refuting allegations of his connection to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) militant group, has linked accusations that DAP supports the LTTE to the forth coming Tanjung Piai by-election. He also called on the police to investigate such fake news went viral on social media which following earlier police arrest and detention of seven individuals, including DAP's Malacca state exco cum assemblyman for Gadek G. Saminathan and Negeri Sembilan state assemblyman for Seremban Jaya P. Gunasekaran, over alleged links to the LTTE. PUTRA's president Ibrahim Ali also had claimed the agenda of the LTTE issue is to attract the Malay votes in the by-election. Johor UMNO chief Hasni Mohammad had said that hopefully there wouldn't be a second by- election the next coming year in relation to the PH candidate's elderly age. Hasni was condemned by BERSATU for mocking the PH candidate's age and predicting his lifespan. Results =Results according to polling districts= BN won all polling districts and post and early votes.

Biography Sloss was born in 1823 to a Jewish family in Untereisenheim, Bavaria, Germany. In 1845, he immigrated to the United States first settling in Kentucky and then Nevada City, California in 1849 during the California Gold Rush. He opened a general merchandise store with partners Dr. Richard H. McDonald and C.H. Swift (who traveled with him from Kentucky) in Sacramento, California that sold all types of goods for new arrivals including horses, mules, wagons, tents, and mining equipment. Sloss and McDonald, then partnered with Simon Greenwald and Lewis Gerstle, and opened a wholesale grocery firm. After the Great Flood of 1862 devastated Sacramento, Sloss and Gerstle moved to San Francisco where they worked as stockbrokers. In 1868, after the purchase of Alaska from Russia, Sloss and Gerstle formed the Alaska Commercial Company. In the 1870s, they won a 20-year concession to harvest seals in Pribilof Islands; and expanded their retail activities to village stores in Alaska where natives could trade gold, fish, and furs for dry goods. The company eventually paid more in fees to the United States' Treasury than the United States paid to purchase Alaska. Sloss served on the Board of Regents of the University of California and a trustee of the San Francisco Public Library. He served as president of Congregation B'nai Israel in Sacramento.

He was the teacher of Adriaan Frederik van der Weij and the first chairman of the Bond van Nederlandse Architecten (BNA; the Association of Dutch Architects), beginning in 1909. Life and career =Youth, Training, and Early Career, 1869–1900= Karel de Bazel was the son of Karel Pieter Cornelis de Bazel, caretaker of the Ministry of Marine, and Petronella Elisabeth Koch. De Bazel came from a modest background and his formal education as a youth only extended through primary school. Much later, De Bazel began his career as an apprentice to a carpenter. De Bazel took evening courses in architecture at the Koninklijke Academie van Beeldende Kunsten (Royal Academy of Visual Arts) in The Hague, and then took a job as a draftsman at the Nieukerken architectural firm in The Hague in 1888. In 1889, through his brother, who worked as a French translator at a publishing house in Leiden, De Bazel found work as a draftsman for prominent Dutch architect P.J.H. Cuypers in Amsterdam. During this period he executed perspective drawings of St. Vitus' Church in Hilversum and St. Bavo's Cathedral in Haarlem, which so impressed Cuypers that he first promoted De Bazel to head draftsman and later his chief designer, overseeing the rest of the firm. But after De Bazel became a member of the Theosofische Vereniging (Theosophical Society) in 1894, he left Cuypers' firm, as his employer was Catholic. In 1895, De Bazel and Johannes Ludovicus Mathieu Lauweriks formed their own independent partnership. Between 1897 and 1902 the duo taught courses alongside H. J. M. Walenkamp in the new Theosophical Vahânaloge they had founded in Amsterdam the previous year in drawing, art history and aesthetics; the institution operated until 1931. Here they made connections between architecture, mathematics, nature, and the cosmos. =Mature architectural work, 1900–23= The De Bazel building, former headquarters of the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij and later ABN-Amro bank, has housed the Amsterdam City Archives since 2007. Photo: bma.amsterdam.nl. Interior of the Synagogue of Enschede. In 1904 De Bazel founded the famous Amsterdam furniture studio De Ploeg with his brother-in-law Kees Oosschot and Klaas van Leeuwen. Along with Hendrik Petrus Berlage, he pioneered the Dutch architectural rationalism that would become characteristic of national practice during and after the First World War. His designs also began to be influenced by Eastern architecture. During this period, De Bazel executed numerous designs around and for the municipality of Bussum. The first of these was De Bazel's model farm Oud Bussem (1903), located on the eponymous estate in Het Gooi. This complex was founded by a wealthy student in response to an outbreak of typhus that had contaminated fresh milk that had been sold nationwide. Both Berlage and Willem Marinus Dudok praised this design, calling it De Bazel's best work. In 1921, he was commissioned by the municipality of Bussum design a new residential area, the Brediuskwartier, which remains one of the most beautiful and completely remaining examples of a residential neighborhood in the style of the Amsterdam School style in the Netherlands. On 17 November 2006, the district was officially designated by the government as a protected townscape. He also designed a park and workers' housing in Bussum, and other residential districts for workers and bourgeois clients alike in Eindhoven and Dieren, and between 1913 and 1923 De Bazel also designed several blocks of workers' housing in the Spaarndammerbuurt west of the center of Amsterdam. In 1905 De Bazel also designed an octagonal-plan World Capital complex, including a Peace Palace and three academies, for the Foundation for Internationalism just outside The Hague, which, however, was never executed, except for the Peace Palace. Berlage included De Bazel's designs in his 1908 Expansion Plan for The Hague, but this was never realized, either. Other works from this period include the building for the Nederlandse Heidemaatschappij (a Dutch environmental and infrastructure consulting and engineering firm, now called ARCADIS) in Arnhem, built from 1912–14, which was the first large-scale structure in the Netherlands to make use of reinforced concrete. The structure is now called the De Bazel–Arnhem after him. De Bazel also worked on the designs for a glass factory in Leerdam, which beginning in 1915 engaged several artists to design utilitarian and decorative products, among them Berlage and Frank Lloyd Wright. Late in life, De Bazel designed his most famous work, the headquarters for the Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM; Dutch Trading Company), built from 1919–26 at Vijzelstraat 32 in Amsterdam, where he also designed much of the interior. The former office building is often colloquially referred to as De Bazel in his honor, and since 2007 has housed the Amsterdam City Archives. He also, significantly, designed the Synagogue of Enschede, which was completed posthumously. =Other design work= De Bazel was also involved in designing furniture and utensils. Well- known examples of this are the cradle he made for Princess Juliana of the Netherlands in 1909 and a Pulchikast that he designed for the occasion of the marriage of Queen Wilhelmina to Prince Hendrik in 1901. De Bazel also designed the stamps issued in honor of the centenary of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1913, which depicted the queen and her three predecessors. =Death= Karel de Bazel died aboard a train from his home in Bussum to Amsterdam, ironically en route to the funeral of his fellow accomplished Dutch architect Michel de Klerk (who had died four days earlier), as a result of a lung condition. He was buried at Westerveld Cemetery in Driehuis.

The plot follows a secret love affair between a southern Baptist preacher and a young drifter that challenges the equilibrium of a growing church. Plot Eli, a preacher in Hot Springs, Arkansas who inherited his father’s Baptist church after his death, has watched the once thriving congregation and church’s funds dwindle down to nearly nothing. Emmanuel Baptist, the competing church in Hot Springs, boasts high congregation numbers and the minister, “Brother Aaron”, even has his sermons broadcast on the local radio. After Eli’s sermon one service, he notices a drifter, Daniel, in attendance for the church’s free pot-luck afterwards. Eli introduces himself and his pregnant wife June to Daniel. Daniel is initially standoffish and abruptly leaves when Eli does not offer him a place to stay after he asks. Eli’s friend Trevor invites him to go hunting. He tells Eli that the congregation have been talking about replacing him with a different pastor. Trevor has invited the Southern Baptist Board of Churches to what he calls the Revival, a church service they will sell tickets to with food, singing, dancing, and plenty of evangelical preaching from Eli and Eli reluctantly accepts. Later, Eli finds Daniel waiting outside the church because he is hungry and invites him in. In Eli’s office, Daniel opens up to him when Eli offers his own lunch to him. Daniel notices a Marcel Proust collection on a bookshelf and the two men connect over the author. When Daniel’s finished eating, Eli brings Daniel to his father’s cabin in the woods—a place Eli’s father kept secret as a way to deal with Eli’s alcoholic mother’s erratic behavior (before she also died) away from the eyes of the city and his parish. Eli cleans and re-bandages a wound on Daniel’s hand when he embraces Eli and the two almost kiss before Eli leaves. The next day, another parishioner, Jimmy, visits Eli at his office because he is feeling sexually attracted to his cousin, Missy. Eli does little to help Jimmy, but listens to him. Meanwhile, Daniel buys ingredients to make meth. Trevor invites Eli over for a meal to discuss the Revival. He reveals that Brother Aaron has been doctoring his attendance records and the Southern Baptist Board will be removing him from his position at Emmanuel Baptist. In the meantime, the church’s congregation will need somewhere to go and Trevor convinces Eli to try to bring them to the Revival. Over their meal, it is also revealed that Trevor is a recovering alcoholic, nearly a year sober. That night, Eli brings Daniel more food and they eventually have a sexual encounter, Eli accidentally spending the night. Upon returning home, June is upset but Eli appeases her when he washes her feet, although she is aware of his happy attitude. At his office, Eli is again visited by Jimmy about his feelings for his cousin, which Eli advises him against. June hosts a luncheon prayer circle with the women in the congregation and at the cabin, Daniel cooks meth. That night, Eli’s visit to the cabin again lasts late into the night and he and Daniel have sex, but Eli returns home. Trevor books Eli a radio interview to promote the Revival and he makes an impassioned statement. That night, June confronts him with an exposing picture of Daniel and Eli together and they fight. The next day, Daniel throws away the meth he cooked after Eli implored him to stop, Jimmy watches Missy at her job, and Trevor struggles with his sobriety, while parenting his daughter, who he recently gained custody over. At the cabin that night, Eli tries ending things with Daniel, who confesses his feelings for Eli, but Eli leaves. In his next sermon, Eli begins to utilize more flamboyant, evangelical preaching methods and is finally able to excite his congregation until Daniel shows up and confesses his homosexuality in front of them. Eli takes the opportunity to “heal” Daniel with a blessing in front of the parishioners and Daniel plays along. After the sermon, Eli drives Daniel to the cabin, insisting he pack up and leave but Daniel refuses. Eli returns home where he learns the “healing” has caused the Revival to sell out. June reveals that she took the photo of Eli. He tells June that Daniel will not leave so she tells Eli she is going to “clean up his mess”. Eli drinks heavily and wanders the town drunk, eventually ending up at the church. June goes to the cabin and first threatens Daniel with an allegory, but he still refuses to leave. She exits the cabin as Trevor enters. He beats Daniel unconscious and hogties him. He has Jimmy watch Daniel, telling him they will put him on the next bus out of the city, and leaves. Eli decides to leave the church and go to the cabin, heavily intoxicated. He hits a deer but eventually arrives at the cabin finding the brutalized, barely conscious Daniel and tells Jimmy to leave. Eli lights some newspaper on fire and uses it to burn the cabin down with Daniel inside. As church choir music swells, he watches the cabin burn from his car, Trevor drinks from a whisky bottle and sobs at home, looking over his daughter, and Jimmy finally has sex with Missy. Later, Eli sits on the church stage as an enthusiastic Baptist choir performs for a completely full congregation. When they finish, Eli walks to the pulpit to begin his Revival sermon.
