Synopsis In 1940, after the outbreak of the Second World War, life is hard in a small East European border town under Nazi occupation, as witnessed primarily by a Canadian-born twelve-year-old boy, Jan (Jason Hopley). At times life appears to go on as normal: Jan plays with his dog and has a good relationship with his father Stephan (Kenneth Welsh). But after all a war is on, and with an occupation come midnight raids and violence in the form of street shootings and exploding mortar shells. Jan's father helps a Jewish family stay in hiding, but also houses an SS officer (Slobodan Dimitrijeviƒá) passing through the town. Jan, who has already lost his mother, fears his father may ultimately not survive the war. His stepmother Maria (Helen Shaver) treats him with disdain, and flirts with the German officer. Like his father, Jan defies the Nazis by helping the Jews escape, but is also affected by the sight of wounded German soldiers passing by his home. Jan's character is tempered by these events like \\"the making of a fine sword\\"; the boy will become a man ready to \\"forge his future in a country without fear and hate.\\" Cast In addition, various soldiers were played by Ilija Iveziƒá and Damir Mejov≈°ek. Voice performers: Mary Beth Rubens, Peter Jobin, Michael Kirby, Jeff Pustil, and Robyn Jaffe. Themes The War Boy has been compared to the \\"similarly themed\\" Empire of the Sun, a 1987 film by Steven Spielberg which also depicts \\"a child's eye view of the horrors of war.\\" Production =Background and financing= After making his first feature, A Sweeter Song (1976), Allan Eastman directed around a hundred television productions before undertaking a second feature, which was made with the support of Telefilm Canada. =Filming= The film's working title was Point of Escape. Unlike A Sweeter Song, which was shot on 16mm film, The War Boy was shot on 35mm (Kodak 5247 and 5294). Principal photography took place in Zagreb, Croatia (then part of Yugoslavia) from 24 September to 28 October 1984. Release and reception The War Boy was released in 1985 and distributed by Norstar Releasing, Peter Simpson's recently created (1984) Canadian indepdendent distribution company. =Home media= The War Boy was released on VHS, Betamax, and DVD. In 2007, The War Boy was released as part of a war film anthology DVD box set of five discs by Eclectic called the Dogs o' War Collection, featuring ten films predominantly by Italian directors, prompting Chadwick Jenkins to call them \\"Spaghetti War Flicks\\" after Spaghetti Westerns. =Critical response= Jenkins praises The War Boy, saying it \\"beautifully captures the contradictions of wartime and the devastating nature of simply living and growing up in such times.\\" His only criticism of the film is that the \\"News on the March\\" opening sequence is undermined \\"by having the credits roll over the newsreel.\\" The film is \\"unjustly underrated\\", and when compared with Spielberg's big-budget Empire of the Sun (1987), is arguably \\"more successful on an intimate, personal level in depicting a child's eye view of the horrors of war.\\" Terry Rowan calls Jason Hopely's novice performance \\"beautiful\\", as does VideoHound's Golden Movie Retriever, which assigns the film 2.5 stars. The Great Canadian Movie Guide, by sharp contrast, derides The War Boy as \\"choppy and confusingly disjointed\\", \\"with somewhat stilted performances and dialogue\\" and fails to develop most characters and scenes, or even the idea that the children were born in Canada.

These fortifications were built in the Muromachi period by the Ogasawara clan, who ruled the area at the time. Two of the sites, that of Igawa Castle and Hayashi Castle have been protected by the central government collectively as a National Historic Sites since 2017. Background The Matsumoto Basin, in which the current city of Matsumoto is located was the historic center (kokufu) of Shinano Province since the Nara period. It is also a natural fortification, protected by the Chikuma Mountains to the east, north and south and by the Azusa River to the west. Under the Muromachi shogunate, a branch of the Ogasawara clan was appointed as shugo over the province and Ogasawara Kiyomune established his headquarters at Igawa Castle in 1334. The clan subsequently built many more fortifications around the Matsumoto Basin, including Hayashi Castle, Kirihara Castle, Yamabe Castle, Haibara Castle and Fukashi Castle (later known as Matsumoto Castle) to protect its territory. However, the Ogasawara were able to maintain only a tenuous hold over Shinano Province. The province is divided into many small (and easily fortified) basins which were ruled by powerful local clans who strongly resented being ruled by outsiders. The Ogasawara clan itself was also frequently rent by internal political divisions, and proved unable to resist the advance of Takeda Shingen into the province at the start of the Sengoku period. Ogasawara Nagatoki (1514-1583) was defeated by Shingen at the Battle of Shiojiritoge Pass in 1548 despite having more numerous forces, and was forced to abandon Shinano. The Takeda made Matsumoto Castle the seat of their operations against Uesugi Kenshin to the north in Echigo Province, but retained Hayashi Castle and other existing fortifications in the Matsumoto Basin to protect their rear. After the Takeda clan was annihilated by Oda Nobunaga, the area briefly came under the rule of Kiso Yoshimasa until Nobunaga's death in 1582. The Ogasawara took advantage of the confused state of affairs after Nobunaga's assassination to return to Shinano with the support of Tokugawa Ieyasu. However, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the Tokugawa clan to relocate to the Kanto region in 1590, and the Ogasawara were forced to accompany him, abandoning their castles in Shinano. Subsequently, the Ogasawara rose to the position of daimy≈ç within the Tokugawa shogunate. Igawa Castle Site of Igawa Castle ', also known as the ' was constructed in 1334 when Ogasawara Sadamune was appointed shugo of Shinano. The area was noted for its abundant water supplies, and the castle was a flatland fortification more suitable as a manor house than as a defensive castle. The Ogasawara clan quickly outgrew it, and it was replaced a hundred years later by Hayashi Castle as the clan headquarters, but still existed into the Sengoku period as a secondary fortification. Hayashi Castle Remnant of rampart of Hayashi Castle ' was constructed by Ogasawara Kiyomune in 1459 to replace the smaller Igawa Castle. It is located on a ridge extending northwest from the Takato mountains, in the southeast portion of the modern city of Matsumoto. The castle is actually a double fortification sandwiched in a small valley between two ridges.

The temple, including its famed Japanese garden is not open to the general public. History The early history of the temple is uncertain, and the temple claims to have been founded in 733 AD by the famed Nara period monk Gy≈çki as a temple called Jizo-ji (Âú∞ËîµÂØ∫). The temple has been long associated with the Ii clan, as per Ii family records, the clan itself originated when a baby boy was found by the monks beside a well at the temple in the year 1010 AD. The monks raised the infant, who later took the name of Ii Tomoyasu, and who became the progenitor of the Ii clan. His funeral was held at the temple in 1093, and the temple subsequently served as the bodaiji of the clan.

The temple changed its name to its present name in 1507. During the Sengoku period, the funeral of Ii Naomori was held at this temple in 1560. The graves of Ii Naochika and Ii Naotora are also at this temple. The temple was burned down during an invasion by the Takeda clan in 1570, and was rebuilt during the Edo period.

It was the eighth named storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane ‚Äì Category 3 or higher on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson scale ‚Äì of the 2019 Atlantic hurricane season. Humberto formed on September 13 from the prolonged interaction of a tropical wave and an upper-level trough, then paralleled the eastern coastline of Florida through September 16 before turning sharply northeastward. A generally favorable environment allowed Humberto to become a hurricane that day, and the storm further strengthened to reach peak intensity as a Category 3 hurricane on September 18\\\\. After its center passed within 65 miles (100 km) of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, the system encountered stronger wind shear and drier air. Stripped of its deep thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned to a potent extratropical cyclone early on September 20\\\\. Forming on the heels of Hurricane Dorian two weeks prior, Humberto proved far less destructive throughout the Bahamas, producing only some squally weather. The eastern coastline of Florida saw tropical storm-force wind gusts, choppy seas, and light rainfall. Rip currents killed one person in Florida and another in North Carolina. In Bermuda, coastal flooding and rainfall were limited by low astronomical tides and Humberto's quick forward motion. However, peak surface winds of around 110 mph (177 km/h), with higher gusts, caused widespread damage to trees, roofs, crops, and power lines, most notably on the western end of the island chain. Some 90% of Bermuda's banana crop was lost. As many as 600 buildings suffered roof damage, while 27,900 customers were left without power; though most of the network was quickly repaired, some electric outages persisted for at least 10 days. L.F. Wade International Airport and the Bermuda Weather Service campus both suffered property damage. In total, the hurricane wrought over $25 million in damage throughout Bermuda. Hurricane Jerry to the south briefly posed a threat to the territory as cleanup from Humberto got underway, but it ultimately dissipated with no ill-effects. Meteorological history The origins of Humberto trace back to a tropical wave that exited the western coast of Africa on August 27, 2019. Accompanied by little convective activity, the disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic for several days. On September 4, the wave encountered a mid- to upper-level trough of low pressure several hundred miles east of the Lesser Antilles. Resistance from the trough split the wave in two; the southern portion proceeded through the Windward Islands, while the northern portion of the wave moved toward the northwest in tandem with the trough. As the trough became negatively tilted, or oriented northwest-to-southeast, strengthening anticyclonic flow on its east side promoted periods of enhanced convection close to the tropical wave. These convective bursts, largely driven by diurnal cycles, led to the development of a broad surface low on the morning of September 12 as the disturbance turned north-northwest through the Turks and Caicos Islands. At 21:00 UTC, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the disturbance to a potential tropical cyclone, given that it posed a threat to land but its circulation did not yet meet the organization necessary to designate a tropical cyclone. This facilitated the issuance of tropical storm warnings in the Bahamas. Observations from ships and nearby islands early on September 13 indicated that the low-level center had become better defined, and satellite imagery depicted the formation of a narrow curved spiral band in the disturbance's northeastern quadrant. Based on this evidence, the NHC estimated that a tropical depression formed around 18:00 UTC on September 13, approximately 85 miles (140 km) east of Eleuthera in the Bahamas. It intensified into Tropical Storm Humberto six hours later. Humberto as a Category 1 hurricane northwest of the Bahamas and Florida on September 16 The newly formed cyclone slowly turned northwestward as it tracked toward a weakness in the Azores high. Dry air and wind shear imparted by the trough that contributed to Humberto's genesis now inhibited organization, and the tropical storm more closely resembled a subtropical cyclone rather than a fully tropical one during September 14. As the day progressed, reconnaissance missions found a more aligned storm center, an indication that upper-level winds were beginning to relent. Banding features flourished, upper-level outflow expanded, and a formative inner core became apparent. By 00:00 UTC on September 16, Humberto intensified into the season's third hurricane as it temporarily stalled about 175 miles (280 km) east-northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida. From that point, a broad upper-level trough over the East Coast of the United States steered the cyclone sharply toward the northeast. While moving over sea surface temperatures of around 84¬∞F (29¬∞C), Humberto intensified during the next day. The hurricane developed a large eye, 35‚Äì40 miles (55‚Äì65 km) diameter, surrounded by very cold cloud tops, a hallmark of intense thunderstorm activity. Data from a reconnaissance aircraft mission on the evening of September 17 was used as the basis for upgrading Humberto to a Category 3 hurricane around 00:00 UTC on September 18. This upgrade was applied despite a broad and asymmetric wind field that was most expansive in the southern semicircle. As Humberto passed about 65 miles (100 km) northwest of Bermuda around 00:00 UTC on September 19, it reached maximum sustained winds of 125 mph (205 km/h). Some satellite intensity estimates supported Category 4 status, and a dropsonde in the southern eyewall measured winds aloft of 159 mph (256 km/h), in addition to surface winds of 131 mph (211 km/h). However, these values were recorded at two-second intervals and, consequently, were not representative of sustained winds. Additionally, weather radar imagery from Bermuda indicated a quickly eroding eyewall. Therefore, the strongest winds were likely the result of extratropical processes producing a wind maximum akin to a sting jet, which would not be indicative of Humberto's true strength as a tropical cyclone. As Humberto accelerated ahead of the encroaching upper-level trough to its west, it encountered even stronger upper-level winds and drier air that together triggered a weakening trend. By 00:00 UTC on September 20, the system had become devoid of organized deep convection, marking its transition to an extratropical cyclone while located 575 miles (925 km) south-southwest of Cape Race, Newfoundland. The post-tropical cyclone continued to produce a large area of gale-force winds until it merged with an even larger extratropical low around 18:00 UTC on September 20. Preparations Immediately upon the designation of a potential tropical cyclone, tropical storm warnings were issued for the northwestern Bahamas, except Andros Island. At 03:00 UTC on September 13, a tropical storm watch was issued for the east coast of the Florida Peninsula between Jupiter Inlet and the Volusia‚ÄìBrevard County line. After an expansion northward to include more of the Florida coastline, the watch was canceled early the next day. A tropical storm watch was first issued for Bermuda at 21:00 UTC on September 16 and ultimately upgraded to a hurricane warning 24 hours later. All tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued by 06:00 UTC on September 19, after the storm's departure. Changes in the hurricane's structure as it approached the territory posed some forecasting challenges, especially concerning the arrival time and magnitude of damaging winds. Ahead of the storm, eight cruise ships were diverted away from Bermuda. As early as September 16, L.F. Wade International Airport officials requested that vehicles be moved out of the flood-prone long-term parking area. As conditions deteriorated, the airport closed at 19:00 UTC on September 18, resulting in the cancellation of twelve commercial flights. Aircraft were also evacuated from the airport during the closure. \\"The Causeway\\", a route connecting the airport to the territory's population centers, was closed as a precautionary measure shortly after a public curfew took effect at 21:00 UTC on September 18. Ferry services were suspended at the same time, while buses stopped running in the late afternoon. The government opened its only official hurricane shelter in the Cedarbridge Academy. It was staffed by 30 people from various agencies and provided accommodation for up to 100 residents. Individuals who lived on boats or who felt unsafe in their homes were encouraged to take advantage of the facility. Ultimately, nearly 50 people sought refuge there. In an effort to communicate storm dangers to the public, Bermuda's government held a public press conference, activated the Emergency Measures Organisation's emergency broadcast radio station, and sent updates to users of a new official mobile app called Tree Frog, introduced just months prior. Governor John Rankin placed 120 members of the Royal Bermuda Regiment on standby, and ambulances and Bermuda Electric Light Company (BELCO) crews were pre-positioned in strategic locations across the island. Schools, businesses, and governmental offices were closed at 16:00 UTC on September 18. The Bermuda Stock Exchange was also closed on September 18 and 19. Many boat owners removed their vessels from marinas to secure them on land. Impacts =The Bahamas= alt=A visible satellite image of Tropical Storm Humberto northeast of the Bahamas and east of Florida. Cuba is visible near the bottom of the frame. The storm's cloud pattern is asymmetric, with most thunderstorm activity north of the center. Devastated by Hurricane Dorian earlier in the month, the Bahamas were spared significant compounding effects from Tropical Storm Humberto. Grand Bahama International Airport in the northwestern part of the country reported ten-minute sustained winds of just 29 mph (46 km/h) as the storm passed to the east, and rainfall totals were light. Humberto's proximity to the disaster area caused small airfields being used in the distribution of emergency supplies to be closed briefly. =United States= Rip currents produced by Humberto affected the East Coast of the United States for several days. Conditions were particularly treacherous in northeastern Florida, where strong onshore winds and resulting choppy seas made ocean rescues difficult. In St. Johns County, 21 bathers were rescued from rough seas on September 14 and 15. One rip current victim in the county was found dead after a two-day search, while another was hospitalized in critical condition. In Duval County, wind gusts on the periphery of Humberto reached . Florida's eastern coastline also experienced a minor storm surge and light rainfall. Farther north, in Topsail Beach, North Carolina, a 62-year-old man drowned after wading into shallow water and getting caught in a rip current. Later, as the storm grew in strength and size, powerful swells propagated southward to the northern coast of Puerto Rico. In addition to coastal flooding, extensive beach erosion damaged some waterfront structures in Espinar, Agunda. =Bermuda= Hurricane Humberto's wind swath with hurricane-force winds in red and tropical-storm force winds were in orange. Powerful westerly winds were the most severe aspect of the hurricane in Bermuda. The highest wind speeds occurred during a relatively brief period between 23:00 UTC on September 18 and 02:00 UTC on September 19, coinciding with the closest approach of Humberto's center. At the height of the storm, rapid fluctuations in air pressure and temperature were observed concurrently with highly turbulent wind patterns. Though unconfirmed, localized tornadic activity in Humberto's right-front quadrant may have been responsible for instances of isolated damage hours before hurricane-force winds spread across the islands. The quick-moving system was accompanied by only of rain, insufficient to wash away foliage-burning salt residue. Peak storm surge values were under , and low astronomical tides prevented any significant coastal flooding. The lowest air pressure recorded in Bermuda was , and the highest waves in the seas off the territory's northern coast were analyzed near . Analysis of observations from a buoy located off the northwestern coast indicated that parts of Bermuda experienced sustained winds near Category 3 intensity. The instrument recorded ten-minute average winds of 94 mph (152 km/h) gusting to 130 mph (209 km/h), at an elevation of 20 ft (6 m). Adjusting for standard elevation and then converting to a one-minute average yields estimated maximum sustained winds of about 110 mph (178 km/h). On Pearl Island, one-minute sustained winds reached 100 mph (161 km/h), punctuated by gusts as high as 123 mph (198 km/h). L.F. Wade International Airport recorded ten-minute average sustained winds of 82 mph (131 km/h) and a gust of 116 mph (187 km/h). Elevated stations registered even more powerful winds; at above sea level, the Maritime Operations Centre on St. George's Island measured gusts to 144 mph (232 km/h). A private anemometer on the roof of the historical Commissioner's House (part of the National Museum of Bermuda) recorded an extreme wind gust of 192 mph (309 km/h), but both the National Hurricane Center and Bermuda Weather Service believe this value to have been artificially inflated by the flow of air over the building. These intense winds caused extensive damage, particularly to trees, roofs, and power lines; the worst effects were concentrated in western areas. An estimated 500‚Äì600 buildings sustained roof damage, among them being the Somerset Police Station and an African Methodist Episcopal Church in Sandys Parish. This corresponds with the 600 storm-related insurance claims received by three local firms by September 24. Humberto left more than 27,900 electricity customers, around 80% of the territory, without power. Many farmers suffered significant losses of fruit and vegetable crops; in particular, 90% of the banana crop was destroyed, requiring an estimated 18 months to recover. This worsened an ongoing shortage of bananas caused by pest insect infestations in imports of the fruit. Live plants, including poinsettias and vegetable seedlings, were killed in conjunction with the destruction of nursery greenhouses. At the airport, security fences and a jet bridge were badly damaged. In the Royal Naval Dockyard, a shipping container blew into the water and presumably sank. A man attempting to ride out the storm on his yacht was briefly imperiled when the vessel broke free from its moorings and eventually wrecked on an island in the Great Sound. Off the northern shore, the wreck of the paddle steamer Montana, a popular dive site, was heavily damaged. The Bermuda Weather Service campus suffered the loss of a satellite dish, antennas, and the weather balloon launching platform, which was blown off its foundation. The agency also lost communication with its Doppler weather radar system near the height of the storm. No major damage was reported in the capital city of Hamilton, though some city parks were closed to the public due to unsafe conditions. The Bermuda Fire and Rescue Service responded to numerous calls for minor fires and other incidents. In total, Humberto caused more than $25 million in damage to Bermuda. Despite the severity of the storm and breadth of damage, no deaths or serious injuries were attributed to the hurricane in the territory. Aftermath In the wake of the hurricane, fallen or low-hanging trees and power lines left some Bermuda roads impassable, so officials advised residents to remain indoors. From the early morning hours on September 19, the Royal Bermuda Regiment assisted government agencies in removing debris from roads. To accommodate the influx of horticultural debris, the Marsh Folly Composting Facility waived its gate fee for disposal of vegetation. The Causeway was reopened to traffic around midday on September 19 following assessments by structural engineers. L.F. Wade International Airport reopened around the same time once repairs to the damaged fencing had been rushed to completion. Government offices, businesses, and most ferry routes resumed normal operations on September 20, while public schools remained closed for an additional day while building evaluations were underway. As BELCO crews repaired the electricity infrastructure, the number of power outages fell to 10,000 by the morning of September 21 and to 1,000 on September 26. The company, which is Bermuda's only electricity supplier, received help from retired employees and mutual aid from another utility company based in the United States. Restoration was temporarily slowed by several utility pole fires caused by salt corrosion. A small number of outages persisted 10 days after the storm. Despite swift cleanup in most locations, a few small streets and parts of the Bermuda Railway Trail remained blocked for several weeks. Immediately after the hurricane, damaged structures were temporarily protected by tarps. Bermuda's Department of Planning relaxed its requirements for building permits to fix certain types of storm-related damage. As a consequence of an ongoing slate tile shortage caused by the inability of local quarries to meet demand, permanent roof repairs were delayed for many residents. With intensifying Hurricane Jerry to the south also considered a potential threat, preparedness measures resumed almost immediately after Humberto's passage. However, Jerry degenerated into a remnant low pressure system before reaching Bermuda, resulting in only a brief period of inclement weather. Premier of the British Virgin Islands Andrew Fahie expressed that his government was prepared to help Bermuda cope with the effects of hurricanes Humberto and Jerry.

The temple no longer exists, but the temple grounds were designated as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government in 2001. History The site is located on a hill at the southern edge of the Ena Basin at an elevation of 325 meters. Although the ruins of an abandoned temple have long been known to exist, there is no mention of the site in historic literature. The Ena City Board of Education commissioned an archaeological survey to the Nanzan University in 1977-1979 and again in 1993-1999. The survey found the foundations of several buildings and many pottery shards, from which the ruin was dated to the first half of the 8th century. The temple compound measured 110 meters east-west by 70 meters north-south, and the structures consisted of a Main Hall, K≈ç-d≈ç (Lecture Hall), Pagoda, rectory, cloister, and several smaller structures in a layout almost identical to that of H≈çry≈´-ji. No roof tiles were found, indicating that these buildings pre-dated the use of tiled roofs. Also, the layout and design of a storehouse was also highly unusual, with the only other structure known to have a similar arrangement having been discovered in the ruins at Asuka, Nara. Two pit dwellings were also identified, one of which may have been a smithy. The temple appears to have gone into decline after a fire in the 9th century and to have disappeared by the early 10th century. The foundation of the temple may be connected with the establishment of Ena District, which also occurred in the first have of the eighth century, The site is located about 1.6 km south of Ena Station.

It is similar to the sweet potato pie that originated in the Southern United States. This dish however, often uses Okinawan sweet potatoes which are purple in color. It has three layers. The bottom layer is a macadamia nut crust. The middle layer is the Okinawan sweet potato portion. The top layer is a haupia topping, which is added when the bottom two layers are cooled to prevent it from being runny. The Okinawan sweet potatoes are distinct in flavor and texture to other types of sweet potatoes, so it cannot be substituted without affecting the final outcome. The sweet potatoes need to be cooked thoroughly in order to become sweet and turn deep purple. The dessert is very rich, and it is made at any time of the year.

Early life Umarov was born on 29 January 1921 to a Chechen peasant family in Novye Atagi. After attending a rural school he went on to study at a trade school in Grozny before entering the Sernovodsky Pedagogical College, which he graduated from in 1939. In November that year he was drafted into the Red Army, and was initially assigned to a rifle regiment in Arkhangelsk. He first saw combat during the Winter War with Finland, during which he realized he wanted to become an officer. For his courage in the war he was allowed to enter the S.M.Kirov Leningrad Infantry Command School. World War II and death As an active duty officer, Umarov first saw combat in World War II on 8 July 1941, not long after the start of Operation Barbarossa. He and other cadets at the military school were placed in a battalion in which they took part in the defense of Leningrad. Just eight days later he was promoted to lieutenant, but was badly wounded on 23 July. After recovering he became the deputy political commander of a rifle company. He was soon promoted to senior lieutenant and made commander of the 2nd Rifle Company within the 112th Separate Rifle Brigade. In that position he was killed in action on 11 January 1943 while he led his company in the defense of Skugorevo village. During the ensuing conflict he engaged in hand-to-hand combat in trenches, and continued fighting to the death even after suffering a broken arm.

His courtesy title before the Meiji restoration was Iga-no-kami, and his Court rank was Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade. Biography Matsudaira Tadanari was the third son of Matsudaira Tadakata and became heir on the deaths both his elder brothers in infancy. He became daimy≈ç in 1859 on the sudden death of his father. Due to his youth, he had difficulties in holding the clan together during the tumultuous Bakumatsu period. The domain sided with the imperial cause in the Boshin War of the Meiji restoration from 1868 and contributed its military forces to the Battle of Hokuetsu and Battle of Aizu, but its kokudaka was still reduced by the new Meiji government by 3000 koku. In June 1869, he was appointed imperial governor; however, only two months later faced a serious peasant's revolt in his domain which was suppressed only with difficulty. With the abolition of the han system in 1871, he relocated to Tokyo. The following year, together with his younger brother, Matsudaira Tadaatsu, he travelled to the United States and attended Rutgers University, where he excelled in his studies and where he was inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa honor society. He returned to Japan in 1879. In 1880, he received a position at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Newsom's was born in Shongaloo, where his father was a cotton farmer and his mother was a teacher. He went to the local high school and grew up with an interest in dogs and hunting. In 1936 he went to study at the Louisiana Technological University where he became interested in entomology. He moved to Louisiana State University and obtained a BS in 1940 while also becoming a college boxing champion. He then went to Cornell University but the war interrupted his studies, and he joined the US Army Medical Corps in 1942 working on mosquito and louse control. He returned to Cornell in 1946 and received his PhD with studies on \\"The Biology and Economic Importance of the Clover Root Borer, Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham)\\" in 1947. His contemporaries included Floyd Miner, Willard Whitcomb, and Robert L. Metcalf. He then moved to Louisiana State University and worked on the entomology of cotton and other pests for the rest of his life. Newsom's research findings included the life history of the boll weevil and its diapause which required the accumulation of fat for overwintering. He identified a combination of management practices that included the careful and limited use of pesticides like DDT to manage weevil populations. The method is known as the Newsom/Brazzel system. He was a promoter of careful monitoring of pests for intelligent management and opposed to the use of fixed and mindless pesticide spraying schedules. He died at Magazine, Arkansas.

It is part of the Anne Arundel County Public Schools system and lies about 10 minutes northwest of Annapolis, 25 minutes east of the District of Columbia, and 35 minutes southwest of Baltimore. It will serve students from the greater Crofton area. The school (virtually) opened its doors to students in grades 9 and 10 only on September 8, 2020. The school will have 11th grade students starting fall 2021, and will have its first senior class in the fall of 2022 (comprising the school's first graduating class, the Class of 2023). History Historically, all high school students in Crofton were served by Arundel High School in Gambrills. However, in the 1990s, Arundel High School began experiencing extreme overcrowding issues to point where the school held split sessions to alleviate the overcrowding. Eventually, community members started pushing for county officials to build a new high school in Crofton. In 1998, instead of building a new high school in Crofton, Anne Arundel County Public Schools officials decided to split Crofton Middle School students between two high schools in the county. The plan redistricted students zoned to Crofton Meadows and Crofton Woods Elementary Schools from Arundel High School to South River High School in Edgewater beginning in the fall of 1998. Crofton residents were told by school district officials that the redistricting of students from Arundel to South River was only a temporary measure until a high school in Crofton would be built in the near future. However, the \\"temporary\\" solution became permanent as Crofton Middle School graduates were continuously split between Arundel and South River High Schools for 17 years with no plans of a new Crofton High School. During those 17 years, Crofton residents (as well as residents of nearby towns such as Odenton and other areas in Anne Arundel County) were advocating for a new high school to be built, but many of the attempts were met with no success. The most recent was an activist group called \\"Build Crofton High School\\", formed in 2012 by Crofton residents. In 2015, after AACPS did a professional study on their facilities and the results strongly suggested to build a new high school in Crofton, Anne Arundel County Public Schools adopted a plan to build a new high school in Crofton. It was decided that the new high school would be built on a portion of the land that belongs to Crofton Park, behind Crofton Middle School. Construction for the new school building began in November 2017. Attendance boundaries for the school were finalized in April 2019. On August 26, 2019, a community meeting was held at Crofton Middle School with attendance by parents, students, and area residents; the meeting included a ballot on an unofficial name for the new high school, in which voters favored the name \\"Crofton High School\\" with 323 out of 402 votes. The name \\"Crofton High School\\" was officially approved by the county's Board of Education on September 11, 2019. Students Crofton High School gathers all students with Crofton addresses and some students with Gambrills and Odenton addresses that fall within the Crofton area. The attendance area also includes a small portion of Davidsonville. Crofton High School only has one feeder middle school, which is Crofton Middle School. Crofton Middle School has four feeder elementary schools: Crofton E.S., Crofton Meadows E.S., Crofton Woods E.S., and Nantucket E.S. Crofton High School‚Äôs grand-opening was not held in person, as Crofton High opened during the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Like most other Maryland school districts, Anne Arundel County Public Schools decided to start the first half of the 2020-2021 school year virtually due to the second rise in cases of COVID-19 in July 2020. Thus, Crofton High opened its doors to its first students online.

Michael moves to Santa Carla, California from Phoenix, Arizona with his mother Lucy and brother Sam. During his time in Santa Carla, he becomes involved with a biker gang who are revealed to have been vampires and is turned by their charismatic leader, David Powers. Fictional character biography Michael Emerson is the son of Lucy Emerson (Dianne Wiest) and the older brother to Sam (Corey Haim). He is seen as being a relatively quiet teenager interested in fitness and motorcycles. He moves from his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona to Santa Carla, California after his mother's divorce. While there, Michael becomes infatuated with a girl named Star (Jami Gertz), who appears to be in a relationship with David Powers (Kiefer Sutherland). David challenges Michael to a deadly motorcycle race, which Michael loses, and invites him back to their hangout. While at their hangout, David taunts Michael before eventually offering him wine, which was really blood, turning him into a half-vampire. David and his gang hang off of the underside of an elevated train before each individually falling off. Eventually, Michael loses his grip and falls, waking up in his own bed. Michael's newfound abilities eventually manifest themselves when he begins reacting negatively to sunlight, constantly wearing sunglasses and one night begins flying around the house. He confides in his brother Sam to help him, as Sam had recently befriended self-proclaimed vampire hunters, Edgar and Alan Frog (Corey Feldman and Jamison Newlander). Michael has another encounter with David where David attempts to persuade Michael into killing. Michael instead watches in horror and fear as David and his gang massacre a group of Surf Nazis. Michael returns home where he comes across Star, who reveals that she too is a half-vampire and Michael was intended to be her first victim, turning her into a fully-fledged vampire. After this, Michael leads Sam, Edgar and Alan to David's lair, where they rescue Star and another half-vampire Laddie (Chance Michael Corbitt), and end up successfully killing one vampire in Marko (Alex Winter). The group barely escape with their lives and only do so due to David's hand coming into contact with sunlight. That evening, Michael, Sam, Edgar and Alan prepare to defend themselves, Star and Laddie from David and the other two remaining vampires. This results in the deaths of the other two vampires (Brooke McCarter and Billy Wirth) leading to a final confrontation between Michael and David, which ends with Michael implanting David on a set of deer antlers. After seemingly killing David, Michael and Star notice that their vampiric abilities are still present. It is then revealed that Max (Edward Herrmann), a seemingly innocent video store owner who was romantically interested in Lucy, is the true head vampire who had David turn Michael in hopes of getting Lucy to become a mother to the vampires. Michael's grandfather (Barnard Hughes) then stakes Max with his tractor, freeing Michael, Star and Laddie from their vampirism. Development In the original screenplay of the film, written by James Jeremias and Janice Fischer, the story was originally meant to be modelled after initial director Richard Donner's recent hit, The Goonies. This was later changed when Joel Schumacher and Jeffrey Boam came aboard. According to Kiefer Sutherland, Jason Patric had a hand in changing the film's tone. Sutherland elaborated on this at a convention stating: \\"Jason had a large part to do with that, [he] was really instrumental in kind of, changing, working with Joel on the script, sometimes in a nice way, sometimes not so nice.\\" Ben Stiller had also auditioned for a role in the movie, but while Stiller hasn't explicitly stated which role, many fans have been led to believe that Stiller was up for the role of Michael, before it went to Jason Patric, who had initially turned the role down. Patric was cast early on in production, and eventually convinced Schumacher to cast Jami Gertz as Star, having worked together previously in Solarbabies. Reception While not much is known about his personality, Michael's encounters with David and the character's restrained and vulnerable portrayal by Jason Patric were highly praised. The dynamic and tension between actors Jason Patric and Kiefer Sutherland were also a point of critical acclaim. The character has also been interpreted to have carried homoerotic themes throughout the screenplay, due to the attraction he carried toward David and the vampire gang. Kiefer Sutherland, who played David, has commented on the possible homoeroticism in the film, describing an encounter between David and Michael as \\"sensual\\". Cat LaFuente from The List commented on the undertones stating, \\"Then there are the vampire boys, who all sleep in the same room and do everything together. Could it be, perhaps, that their leather-forward outfits hint at an interest in the underground gay culture of the 1980s? They all drank David's bodily fluids, after all, so it's not out of the realm of possibility. And why are none of them hooking up with Star, the only woman who's ever around? That would certainly explain the dramatic tension between David and Michael.\\" Some viewers have interpreted that the undertones included in the film were a result of director Joel Schumacher, who is an openly gay man in real life. The character is set to be featured in an upcoming television series reboot on The CW portrayed by Tyler Posey. However, Posey was replaced by Branden Cook, with the character renamed as Garrett. In popular culture The character has been referenced multiple times in popular culture. The scene in the film featuring the character's initiation by David where he turns noodles into worms was parodied in the Taika Waititi's 2014 parody film What We Do In The Shadows. The character has also gotten a \\"Funko Pop!\\" figurine based on the character, as well as an action figure by the National Entertainment Collectables Association. The character's notability has also been recognised as one of the most memorable things from the film, with some fans even mocking the fact that the character's name is said a grand total of 114 times throughout the film's 98 minute runtime. Michael also re-appears in the 2016 The Lost Boys sequel comic series of the same name published by Vertigo Comics. =Comparisons to Billy Hargrove from Stranger Things= There are many references and homages to Michael Emerson throughout the hit Netflix streaming show Stranger Things through the character of Billy Hargrove, played by Australian actor Dacre Montgomery. The character was modelled after Jason Patric's look in the film, to the extent of adopting the lone earring Michael wore in the film. Hargrove has also been noted for the similarity between him and Michael, both being new punk kids in a small town, as well as Billy's struggle not to become consumed by The Mind Flayer, noting similarities between Michael's fight against his newly-discovered vampirism. Ironically, Billy Hargrove has also been compared to that of Kiefer Sutherland as well, notably the characters of David and Ace Merrill from Stand by Me. In the comparisons to David, the character of Steve Harrington (portrayed by Joe Keery) is instead used as the example of Michael, due in parts to Billy's attitude and Steve's reluctance to give in to Billy. The adversary relationship between Billy and Steve played a prominent role in the show's second season, which led to many fans noticing the similarities between the relationship of David and Michael to that of Billy and Steve.

History  In 2013, Anton Chuvakin of Gartner coined the term \\"endpoint threat detection and response\\" for \\"tools primarily focused on detecting and investigating suspicious activities (and traces of such) other problems on hosts/endpoints\\". Now, it is commonly known as \\"endpoint detection and response\\". According to the Endpoint Detection and Response - Global Market Outlook (2017-2026) report, the adoption of cloud- based and on-premise EDR solutions are going to grow 26% annually, and will be valued at $7273.26 million by 2026. According to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Cyber Security Market report by Zion Market Research, the role of machine learning and artificial intelligence will create a $30.9 billion cyber security market by 2025.  Concept  Endpoint detection and response technology is used to protect endpoints, which are computer hardware devices, from threat. Creators of the EDR technology based platforms deploy tools to gather data from endpoint devices, and then analyze the data to reveal potential cyber threats and issues. It is a protection against hacking attempts and theft of user data. The software is installed on the end-user device and it is continually monitored. The data is stored in a centralized database. In an incident when a threat is found, the end-user is immediately prompted with preventive list of actions. Every EDR platform has its unique set of capabilities. However, some common capabilities include the monitoring of endpoints in both the online and offline mode, responding to threats in real-time, increasing visibility and transparency of user data, detecting store endpoint events and malware injections, creating blacklists and whitelist, and integration with other technologies.

Biography  His father was the overseas merchant, , a pioneer in German-Japanese trade. He spent part of his childhood there, then was returned to Germany to attend school; first in Blankenese and later in the countryside in Schleswig-Holstein. From 1898 to 1899, he received private painting lessons from in Kiel, then from in Hamburg (1900-1901). After that, he took courses in art history at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and attended classes in nude painting led by Heinrich Knirr. From 1903 to 1908, he took further classes in nude painting from Ludwig von Hofmann (who later became a friend and supporter) at the Grand-Ducal Saxon Art School, Weimar. It was there he came into contact with Neoimpressionism but, after experimenting with that style, turned decisively away from it. After completing his classes, he exhibited with the Berlin Secession and established a studio community with his former classmate from Munich, Hans Delbr√ºck. In 1910, both of his parents died, leaving him a considerable fortune. The following year, he used some of it to build a villa in Falkenstein (an outlying district of Hamburg), designed by the architect, Walther Baedeker (1880-1959), where he established his studio. In 1920, he became a member of the and, two years later, of the . In 1924, he relocated to Wernigerode, in Harz, where he died in 1959.

The film stars Vidya Balan as Shakuntala Devi, who was also known as the \\"human computer\\", along with Jisshu Sengupta, Sanya Malhotra, and Amit Sadh. Principal photography began on 16 September 2019 and was wrapped up on 20 November 2019. The film was scheduled to be theatrically released in India on 8 May 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the film was streamed worldwide on 31 July 2020 on Prime Video. Plot In 2001, Anupama Banerjee arrives in London with her husband Ajay, and reveals that she is suing her mother, Shakuntala Devi. The film shifts to Shakuntala Devi's childhood in Bangalore in the 1930s, where her family discovers her incredible talent for quickly solving complex mathematical problems in her head. Her father, Bishaw, decides to use Shakuntala's talent and have her do \\"math shows,\\" where she would entertain people with her problem solving prowess. Shakuntala continues to do math shows and earn for the family as she grows up, but blames her father for not letting her live a normal childhood. She also blames her mother for not standing up to him, especially in the wake of her sister's death. In 1954, she leaves for London after a violent altercation with her boyfriend, Dhiraj, after she learns that he had been pretending to love her even though he had a marriage fixed and even the invites printed out. In London, Shakuntala lives with Tarabai in her home with three other Indian men, but struggles to find opportunities for her shows. But, she eventually manages to impress Javier, a Spanish mathematician when she shows off her skills at the Royal Mathematical Society in London. He helps improve Shakuntala's English and helps her get shows, and the pair begin a relationship as well. Shakuntala's popularity rapidly grows, and is given the nickname \\"The Human Computer\\" after she proves a computer wrong on a TV show. She expands her global influence by performing in other countries, and becomes a worldwide celebrity. Amidst all of this, Javier ends his relationship with Shakuntala, stating that he needs to return to Spain. In 1968, Shakuntala meets Paritosh Banerji in Bombay, and the two quickly fall in love. The couple eventually get married and settle in Calcutta, with the aspirations of starting a family. In 1970, Shakuntala gives birth to Anupama, nicknamed Anu, and devotes her life to being a mother. However, she realizes how much she misses doing shows and decides to resume her career, leaving Anu with Paritosh. Shakuntala continues to amaze people, and even makes it into The Guinness Book of Records, but she worries about being an uncaring mother. Ultimately, she decides to take Anu with her on her travels, much to Paritosh's dismay. They soon divorce. While growing up, Anu travels around the world with her mother. As Shakuntala is constantly exploring new career avenues, Anu finds herself constantly ignored and disenchanted with her life. Even after enrolling Anu in a boarding school, Shakuntala uses every opportunity she can to have Anu accompany her. This reaches a breaking point when a teenage Anu lashes out at her mother for building her career at the expense of her childhood. In response, Shakuntala takes a break and settles with Anu in London, even supporting her business aspirations. This helps the two become close. Their relationship sours again when an adult Anu decides to marry Ajay, a businessman. Shakuntala informs Ajay of her expectation of him moving with them to London, despite him being settled in Bangalore. Anu accuses her mother of constantly holding her back and not letting her live her own life. Shakuntala, unwilling to let her daughter go, threatens to shut down Anu's business. Anu cuts off all contact with Shakuntala, and marries Ajay. She decides to not have children, fearing that she won't be a good mother. Despite this, Anu gives birth to a daughter, Amritha. Anu and Ajay receive a shock when they are informed that Shakuntala used her power of attorney to sell Anu's business properties, while giving her zero percent of the profit share. Furthermore, she passed the payment of the capital gains tax on to Anu, leaving her family in massive debt. Anu and Ajay decide to take legal action against Shakuntala, and travel to London for the proceedings. Upon their arrival, they discover that Shakuntala's actions were a stunt, done so she could force her daughter to come see her. Shakuntala gives Anu the profit received from the sale of her properties, and asks for her forgiveness. Anu forgives her mother, and the two have an emotional reunion.

It was published in 2018 by Picador. The story-line is set in United States post World War II. Robertson received the Goldsmiths Prize, Walter Scott Prize and was shortlisted for the Booker Prize for this work.  Content and publishing  The 200+ page novel is composed of verse and prose. The protagonist is Walker, who is an allied war veteran who served during the invasion of Normandy in 1944. He was born in Nova Scotia, but has hallucinatory memories and does not want to go back home. He instead goes to New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. He heads to New York first and happens to meet film noir director Robert Siodmak at a bar. He sees the making of various noir films and this helps in setting timelines within the novel. He works at docks and later moves to Los Angeles and starts writing for a newspaper. His work takes him to San Francisco where he reports on the situation of homeless citizens. Ironically, when he returns to Los Angeles, his neighborhood is being destroyed to make way for new infrastructure. Various other characters in the novel include Billy Idaho, who is a Utah Beach veteran and narrates the history of Los Angeles to Walker. Another veteran Frank, known as \\"Glassface\\", was the victim of torture by Nazi Party's Hitlerjugend (Hitler Youth). Pike is a reporter and his character is used to represent the future youth and internet culture of selfies. The narrative also brings out references to other historical events like Highland Clearances and Trail of Tears. Before The Long Take, Robertson had published six poetry collections and was the editor for various notable novelists and poets like John Banville, Anne Enright, James Kelman, Irvine Welsh, Anne Carson and Alice Oswald.  Review and reception  The Washington Posts Sibbie O'Sullivan calls the novel \\"a propulsive verbal tour de force\\" comparing it with works of Homer and T. S. Eliot. John McAuliffe, who teaches poetry at the University of Manchester's Centre for New Writing and writing for The Irish Times appreciates the narrative poetry style for \\"emphasising intensity and tone with its line-breaks and stanzas\\". Rory Waterman for The Times Literary Supplement calls the novel \\"immaculately researched in terms of geography, current affairs, and its constant cultural touchstones in the Hollywood films of the time\\". The novel won the 2018 Roehampton Poetry Prize, organized by University of Roehampton. It won the 2018 Goldsmiths Prize with Adam Mars- Jones, who chaired the judging committee, calling it \\"a film noir verse novel full of blinding sunlight and lingering shadows, technically accomplished, formally resourceful and emotionally unsparing\\". It was shortlisted for the 2018 Booker Prize, and won the 2019 Walter Scott Prize with Robertson becoming the first Scot and first poet to win the award.

The film is produced and bankrolled by Fox Star Studios. It features Kunal Khemu and Rasika Dugal in lead roles, and Vijay Raaz, Ranvir Shorey and Gajraj Rao in supporting roles. The film revolves around a red coloured suitcase (Joy Bagman/ Anand Petikar). It was scheduled for theatrical release on 10 April 2020, but the release was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic. It was released on 31 July 2020 on Disney+ Hotstar. Upon release, it met with extremely positive reviews for its humour, tone and comical performances by its cast.  Plot Nandan Kumar, a middle-class man who repairs machines at a printing press, doesn't believe in destiny and lives in a chawl with his taunting wife Lata and son Ayush. Nandan's family struggles to reconcile their dreams and aspirations with their financial reality. MLA Patil attempts to transfer Rs. 10 crore and a file containing evidence of widespread embezzlement to another minister. He blackmails local gangster Omar to carry out this task; his men put the money in a red suitcase. While transporting the money, Omar's men are ambushed by the goons of rival gangster Bala Rathore. Patil's men hide the suitcase during a shootout, hoping to retrieve it later. However, Nandan comes across it by chance, and finding it full of money, decides to take it home and hides it in his neighbor's home. When Bala and Patil realize that the suitcase (and the file) is missing, they send their respective men to find it at any cost. Patil additionally blackmails policeman Kolte and recruits him to retrieve the suitcase. Kolte and his informant Fazlu gather information about the shootout but find that nearby CCTV cameras are not operational. Meanwhile, Nandan spends some money on his family but keeps Lata in the dark about the source of the money. Bala's men spot Fazlu, and begin tracking Kolte. Nandan removes some of the money from the suitcase, divides it into several packets, and hides them around the house, keeping one packet in his office drawer. One CCTV camera becomes operational, allowing Kolte to see Nandan leaving the scene in an auto-rickshaw. Meanwhile, Nandan has his hands full in attempting to keep his money hidden from his neighbors and Lata. In an effort to spend his cash, he attempts to buy a luxurious apartment only to find that they do not accept cash payments. Kolte finds the auto-rickshaw driver from the CCTV footage, and is able to identify Nandan (the driver had spotted Nandan's debit card with his name and bank information). Nandan goes to his bank to inquire about a cash-counting machine, but the cashiers laugh him off. Paranoid and panicking, he makes a scene and leaves. When Kolte is investigating at the same bank, the cashiers tell him about Nandan's suspicious behavior and provide him Nandan's address. Kolte arrives at his home just as Lata finds the hidden suitcase in the kitchen. Kolte holds the family at gunpoint and demands the money back and Nandan complies. Kolte finds out about the packet in the office, and takes Nandan to retrieve it. Bala's men report this to their boss, and Bala and Patil join hands to kill Kolte and recover the money. When Kolte and Nandan arrive at the office, Kolte sends Nandan inside to get the money - as soon as Nandan leaves, Kolte is ambushed by Bala's men. He manages to escape and finds Patil's file, realizing its importance, he decides to blackmail Patil. Meanwhile Nandan is held up by his drunk boss as he attempts to get the packet. Kolte instructs him to come to secret warehouse. Nandan manages to get there but Bala and Omar ambush the warehouse with their respective men. In the resulting shootout, Nandan is the only survivor. Not learning his lesson about greed, he decides to take the money at the warehouse, but leaves the file. When the contents of the file are made public, Patil's political career is finished. He retires to his village and takes up farming, but Omar's men track him down and kill him.

The exploration, however, was incomplete and the fjord would only be thoroughly surveyed years later by Lauge Koch and by the NSIU (Norges Svalbard og Ishavsunders√∏kelser).

The initiative is supported by the Beilstein-Institut for the Advancement of Chemical Sciences.. STRENDA establishes both publication standards for enzyme activity data and STRENDA DB, an electronic validation and storage system for enzyme activity data. Launched in 2004, the foundation of STRENDA is the result of a detailed analysis of the quality of enzymology data in written and electronic publications .  Organization  The STRENDA project is driven by 15 scientists from all over the world forming the STRENDA Commission and supporting the work with expertises in biochemistry, enzyme nomenclature, bioinformatics, systems biology, modelling, mechanistic enzymology and theoretical biology.  Reporting guidelines  The STRENDA Guidelines propose those minimum information that is needed to comprehensively report kinetic and equilibrium data from investigations of enzyme activities including corresponding experimental conditions. This minimum information is suggested to be addressed in a scientific publication when enzymology research data is reported to ensure that data sets are comprehensively described. This allows scientists not only to review, interpret and corroborate the data but also to reuse the data for modelling and simulation of biocatalytic pathways. In addition, the guidelines support researchers making their experimental data reproducible and transparent . As of March 2020, more than 55 international biochemistry journal included the STRENDA Guidelines in their authors' instructions as recommendations when reporting enzymology data . The STRENDA project is registered with FAIRsharing.org and the Guidelines are part of the FAIRDOM Community standards for Systems Biology .  Applications  STRENDA DB STRENDA DB is a web-based storage and search platform that has incorporated the Guidelines and automatically checks the submitted data on compliance with the STRENDA Guidelines thus ensuring that the manuscript data sets are complete and valid. A valid data set is awarded a STRENDA Registry Number (SRN) and a fact sheet (PDF) is created containing all submitted data. Each dataset is registered at Datacite and assigned a DOI to refer and track the data. After the publication of the manuscript in a peer-reviewed journal the data in STRENDA DB are made open accessible . STRENDA DB is a repository recommended by re3data and OpenDOAR. It is harvested by OpenAIRE. The database service is recommended in the authors' instructions of more than 10 biochemistry journals, including Nature, The Journal of Biological Chemistry, eLife, and PLoS. It has been referred as a standard tool for the validation and storage of enzyme kinetics data in multifold publications A recent study examining eleven publications, including Supporting Information, from two leading journals revealed that at least one omission was found in every one of these papers. The authors concluded that using STRENDA DB in the current version would ensure that about 80% auf the relevant information would be made available. Data Management STRENDA DB is considered a tool for research data management by the research community (e.g. EU project CARBAFIN ).

Educated at the Conservatoire de Paris, he won the Prix de Rome in 1923. His compositions included three operas, a ballet, and several symphonic and chamber music works. From 1926 until his death he was also the director of Conservatoire de Roubaix. Bousquet was born in Marseille and died in Roubaix at the age of 52. He had been awarded the L√©gion d'honneur in 1934. Life and career Bousquet was born in Marseille and began his musical studies there before enrolling in the Conservatoire de Paris in 1907 where he studied under Xavier Leroux, Andr√© Gedalge and Charles-Marie Widor. He won the conservatory's First Prize in harmony in 1909 and First Prize in counterpoint in 1910. His studies were interrupted for four years by World War I when he served in an engineering regiment of the French Army. From 1915 to 1918, Nadia and Lili Boulanger, both graduates of the conservatory, published Gazette des Classes du Conservatoire with news of French musical life and letters from the conservatory's students who had been dispersed by the war. In a letter published in the 27 November 1916 issue Bousquet wrote from the front: > [The gazette] has brought us back together. Music, dormant for an instant in > the depths of memory, begins to sing again, and the musical life evoked in a > few pages, with the exquisite recollections that it brings, achieves the > miracle of awakening, amid so much desolation, an ardent longing for the > future. A recipient of the Croix de Guerre, Bousquet returned to the conservatoire after the war and continued his studies in composition. He entered the competition for the Prix de Rome three times, gaining the Second Prize in 1921 and 1922 and the First Prize in 1923 for his cantata B√©atrix. The First Prize came with a bursary that allowed the recipient to stay at the Villa Medici in Rome for two years and to travel for up to three more years. On his return from Rome in 1926, Bousquet took up an appointment as the director of the Conservatoire de Roubaix, a position he held until his death. In the 1930s he was a founder of the Association des Directeurs d'√âcoles et Conservatoires de Musique Nationaux and later became its honorary president. In 1934 he was awarded the L√©gion d'honneur for his artistic career and military service. He also worked as journalist for the Parisian arts journal Com≈ìdia during the occupation of France in World War II. Bousquet continued to compose throughout his career. His first opera, Zorriga, was written for and performed at the Th√©√¢tre des Ar√®nes in B√©ziers in 1925. His second, Sarati le Terrible, premiered at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra-Comique in 1928. Both were set in North Africa and contained elements of Arabic music. His last works were the three- act comic opera Mon oncle Benjamin and the symphony Hannibal. Mon oncle Benjamin premiered at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Op√©ra-Comique on 10 March 1942 with Roger Bourdin in the title role. Hannibal premiered on 30 November 1942 in Paris. Bousquet died in Roubaix at the age of 52, three weeks after the Hannibal premiere.

Background When the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) 33rd and 38th Ranger Battalions left south Saigon on the morning of 6 May to block the VC thrust toward Ch·ª£ L·ªõn in west Saigon, II Field Force, Vietnam commander General John H. Hay arranged for US troops to fill the gap until ARVN units could be found to do the job. What was intended as a temporary expedient turned into one of the most vicious and sustained battles the Americans would experience in the Saigon area at any point in the war. Under orders from General Hay, the 9th Infantry Division sent Company C, 5th Battalion, 60th Infantry Regiment, up Highway 4 and then east along Route 232, a two-lane road that ran along the southern edge of the city. The road passed through the Eighth District, a Catholic working-class slum that in recent years had sprouted along the southern edge of the Doi Canal. The mechanized unit, commanded by Captain Edmund Scarborough, parked its M113 armored personnel carriers (APCs) at two of the three bridges that spanned the Doi Canal. Scarborough set up his headquarters near the Tung Tien Vuong Bridge (), situated approximately three kilometers due south of the Ph√∫ Th·ªç racetrack. It was also known as the 5A Bridge because Route 5A entered the city at that point. Four kilometers to the east was the Y Bridge (), so named because it resembled that letter when viewed from above. Scarborough sent his 1st Platoon to guard that span. Another four kilometers beyond that lay the Tan Thuan Bridge (), but for the moment that remained under the protection of South Vietnamese Marines. Unknown to the US forces, 4 VC battalions under the control of Sub-Region 3 were headed their way. The goal of the 506th and 508th Battalions, the Phu Loi I Battalion and the 5th Nha Be Battalion was to seize the three bridges in the Eighth District and enter the city to attack the National Police headquarters and other targets. The Phu Loi I Battalion aimed to take the 5A Bridge, while the 506th Battalion headed for the Y Bridge. The 5th Nha Be Battalion, only 110 men strong, advanced on their right flank toward the Tan Thuan Bridge. Coming up behind the 506th Battalion was the 508th Battalion, a below-strength outfit with just 173 men, which had orders to preserve a line of communications into the countryside. Using the many streams and canals that crisscrossed southern Gia ƒê·ªãnh Province, the four battalions travelled by foot and sampan right up to the edge of the city without being detected. Battle The Y Bridge in 1968 Aerial view of the Y Bridge in October 1969 The VC began their assault at 03:45 on 7 May. Soldiers from the 506th Battalion opened fire on the APCs that were standing guard on the Y Bridge. A company from the Phu Loi I Battalion, having already crossed the canal on sampans without being detected, also opened fire from the north bank. The 1st Platoon fired back with their own weapons as AK-47 bullets chipped away the bridgework and pinged off their vehicles. The troops hoped that the intimidating firepower of their .50-caliber and M60 machine guns would keep the VC at a respectful distance. Several Rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs) whooshed out of the darkness, but the rounds slammed into the bridge instead of the vehicles. At 05:30, the 506th Battalion shifted its focus from the 1st Platoon to a police station located just south of the Y Bridge. The outgunned policemen were on the verge of abandoning the building when several helicopter gunships appeared overhead and their guns forced the VC to seek cover. Scarborough immediately sent his 2nd Platoon racing from the 5A Bridge to the police station. An estimated company of VC was getting ready to attack the station from a nearby rice paddy when the 4 APCs rolled into the compound. Their machine guns forced the VC to stay put behind a series of dikes. The fight remained hotly contested until an AH-1 Cobra gunship strafed the length of the dike, putting the VC to flight. While soldiers from the 506th Battalion continued to snipe at the 1st and 2nd Platoons, the main VC threat shifted to the hamlet of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t (), which sat on the canal road a few hundred meters to the west. Now occupied by the Phu Loi I Battalion, the hamlet became Scarborough‚Äôs most pressing problem. As long as the VC controlled C·∫ßu M·∫≠t, Company C would be effectively cut in two. He radioed the commander of the 5/60th Infantry, Lieutenant colonel Eric F. Antila, for instructions. Antila told him to keep his men where they were until more help arrived. Two platoons from Company A were already on their way from B·∫øn L·ª©c District in northeastern Long An Province. Antila also told Scarborough that helicopter gunships from Troop B, 7th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, would arrive shortly. 9 APCs and 58 soldiers from Company A, 5/60th Infantry, arrived in the Eighth District a few hours later. After ARVN troops established a blocking position on the east side of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t, the US soldiers began working their way among the ramshackle buildings and narrow streets on the western side of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t. Many already knew something about urban combat; Company A had fought in the Tet Offensive battle of Cholon and Phu Tho Racetrack. The advance was slow and methodical. In the confusing warren of houses and alleyways, there was always a risk that the VC could sneak through the cordon and double back for a surprise rear attack. The Americans also had to be discriminating in their use of fire because the hamlet was still full of civilians. Air and artillery strikes were ruled out for the same reason. As a result, most of the fighting took place at close range with small arms, grenades, and machine guns. By evening, Company A had killed several dozen VC while losing 2 killed and 47 wounded. Much of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t still remained in VC hands. As the battle for C·∫ßu M·∫≠t heated up, General Hay directed Major general George C. O‚ÄôConnor to commit more men from his 9th Infantry Division. On the afternoon of 7 May, a composite company of the 3rd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment and part of the 6th Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment, landed onto a dry rice paddy some 1.5km south of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t. Antila assumed operational control over those units. Antila now had the equivalent of six companies at his disposal, but many more would be needed to clear the Eighth District. On the morning of 8 May, the infantry company from the 3/39th Infantry, began to sweep C·∫ßu M·∫≠t from south to north. The scout platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 47th Infantry Regiment, joined the action a short time later, adding some extra punch with its APCs and .50-caliber machine guns. The sweep was a harrowing affair. VC spider holes and makeshift bunkers seemed to be everywhere and many houses contained snipers. From those darkened interiors they were often invisible to the US soldiers moving around on the streets outside. Progress was frustratingly slow. The VC‚Äôs tenacity convinced South Vietnamese authorities to permit limited air and artillery strikes. The commander of the 3/39th Infantry, Lt. Col. Anthony P. DeLuca, directed those strikes from his circling command helicopter. South Vietnamese officials did their best to move the residents of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t out of harm‚Äôs way. In some cases, frightened civilians ran straight through ongoing firefights in a desperate attempt to reach safety. Early on 9 May, the 506th Battalion resumed its attack on the Y Bridge. At around 02:30, the VC began mortaring a pagoda where DeLuca had set up his command post. Things quieted down after thirty minutes, but an RPG broke the calm at 04:00 when it slammed into the pagoda. That signalled the start of another mortar barrage against DeLuca‚Äôs command post. As shells exploded outside, the colonel began to get reports of VC activity up and down the length of the Eighth District. No major assault developed, but the shooting continued at a steady pace even after the sun rose. In hindsight, the sudden burst of activity was probably designed to draw attention away from the western suburbs where the Cuu Long II Regiment and the 9th Division were trying to withdraw from the Battle of West Saigon. At daybreak, Antila sent his 5/60th Infantry, on another sweep through C·∫ßu M·∫≠t to clear out the Phu Loi I Battalion. He also dispatched Company B, 6/31st Infantry to assist DeLuca who was strongly engaged with the 506th Battalion around the Y Bridge. As the fighting spread north of the canal, thousands of residents streamed south across the Y Bridge. ARVN troops tried to maintain order but some people were pushed into the coils of barbed wire that lined the bridge. Others were trampled by panicked neighbors. At least 100 civilians either died or became injured while crossing the bridge. Other residents died in the fighting as they ran through the city streets. In the end, most of the terrified civilians made it across the bridge. As their numbers dwindled, the allies began to scour the neighborhood with a more liberal application of firepower. The fighting on 9 May spread well beyond C·∫ßu M·∫≠t and the Y Bridge area. When Company B, 6/31st Infantry, arrived at DeLuca‚Äôs command post early in the afternoon, he ordered them to assist a police facility that had come under attack. The station was located some 800 meters to the southeast (), situated next to the Ong Lon Canal that fed north into the Doi Canal. The VC who had attacked the station was likely the 508th Battalion, which was trying to keep the tributary open for use as a supply and escape route. When Company B‚Äôs APCs rolled up to the embattled station, the VC initially stood their ground, but melted back into the surrounding countryside an hour later when Company A, 3/39th Infantry, joined the fight. Around that same time, another fight was developing in the nearby hamlet of Xom Ong Doi (), two kilometers east of the Y Bridge and the same distance west of the Tan Thuan Bridge. A company from the South Vietnamese 1st Marine Battalion was locked in battle with the 5th Nha Be Battalion, which had been trying to reach the bridge for the past several days. The Marines had enough men to protect the bridge, but not enough to clear Xom Ong Doi, so the 9th Infantry Division extended its zone of responsibility to cover the eastern part of the Eighth District. It gave the mission of securing Xom Ong Doi to the 6/31st Infantry, commanded by Lt. Col. Joseph H. Schmalhorst, which was currently patrolling the region south of the 5A Bridge. It would be joined by the 2/47th Infantry, commanded by Lt. Col. John B. Tower, a mechanized unit stationed at the 3rd Brigade‚Äôs Bearcat Base. Company A and the greater part of Company C, 6th/31st Infantry, landed just east of Xom Ong Doi shortly after noon. The pilots flew fast and low to evade the heavy ground fire that greeted the incoming helicopters. Once the infantrymen got their feet on the ground, they fanned out toward the southern side of the hamlet. Vietnamese marines set up a blocking position to the west. The advancing Americans came under small arms fire but it was not particularly heavy; the hundred or so living members of the 5th Nha Be Battalion were likely stretched thin across the hamlet. The men from the 6/31st Infantry, killed several snipers on the southern edge of Xom Ong Doi and then entered the hamlet at 15:00. About that same time, the 2/47th Infantry, minus Company A, completed its journey from Bearcat to the Eighth District. The mechanized unit sped through downtown Saigon and then crossed over the Tan Thuan Bridge before pulling up along the north side of Xom Ong Doi. The arrival of Tower‚Äôs men meant that the 5th Nha Be Battalion was now boxed in on three sides. For all intents and purposes, it was a complete encirclement because helicopter gunships from the 7th Squadron, 1st Cavalry, watched the open fields to the east. Desperately outnumbered but full of resolve, the 5th Nha Be Battalion would not go down without a fight. A storm of fire raked Company B, 2/47th Infantry, the lead unit in Tower‚Äôs force, as it came rumbling down the canal road. Several soldiers fell dead or wounded during the opening salvo. Company B responded with a fusillade of machine gun and small arms fire that tore into the flimsy buildings that lined the road. From his helicopter buzzing overhead Tower ordered Company C, which was at the rear of the column and had not yet entered Xom Ong Doi, to turn south for a short distance before turning west again to bring flanking fire onto the VC. As the company performed the maneuver, several of the vehicles bogged down in the marshland that bordered the hamlet. The rest backed out to the firm ground on the road. The immobilized vehicles provided supporting fire, while the remainder of the unit began a house-to-house sweep through the hamlet. This clearing operation was a brutal affair. Nearly all of the residents had fled Xom Ong Doi, so it turned into a virtual free-fire zone. The Allies blasted their way through the hamlet, while helicopter gunships sent waves of rockets crashing into the tightly packed buildings. US fighter-bombers swooped in to demolish whole blocks with 500-pound bombs, Napalm and 20-mm. cannon. The 2/47th Infantry, expended so much ammunition that Tower had to arrange emergency resupply from Bearcat. By evening, hostile fire had almost ceased. When the two US battalions pulled back because of darkness, gunships continued to pound Xom Ong Doi by the flickering light of a hundred or more fires. The 2/47th Infantry and the 6/31st Infantry encountered no resistance when they entered the hamlet the next morning. The retreating 5th Nha Be Battalion left behind 12 of its dead in the ruins of Xom Ong Doi. The 2/47th Infantry, had lost 8 men killed during the battle. Although the Americans had driven the 5th Nha Be Battalion out of Xom Ong Doi, the 506th and Phu Loi I Battalions still clung to footholds around the Y Bridge and C·∫ßu M·∫≠t, respectively. DeLuca decided to tackle C·∫ßu M·∫≠t first. On the morning of 10 May, he sent Companies A and B from the 3/39th Infantry, down the canal road to attack the hamlet from the east. Well-hidden snipers brought the column to a halt on the outskirts of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t. DeLuca sent in his reconnaissance platoon as well as Company B, 6/31st Infantry, to execute a flanking attack from the southeast. They, too, came under heavy fire and stopped short of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t. Despite having abundant gunship and artillery support, DeLuca‚Äôs infantry made little progress that day, losing 6 killed and 40 wounded. Airstrikes, artillery, and gunships pounded the enemy positions through the night as DeLuca‚Äôs men readied themselves for another day of gruelling, close-quarter combat. To their relief, the VC began to withdraw on the morning of 10 May. The first sign came when an estimated two VC companies attacked a South Vietnamese Regional/Popular Forces outpost in Xom Tan Liem (), a small hamlet on Route 5A five kilometers south of the Doi Canal. The attack indicated that the VC was moving from the Eighth District back into the countryside. Colonel Antila ordered Companies A and C of the 5/60th Infantry, to rescue the besieged government soldiers and trap the VC force. The two mechanized companies came under heavy fire as they neared Xom Tan Liem. The VC 508th Battalion possessed .51-caliber antiaircraft machine guns, 82-mm. mortars and 75-mm. recoilless rifles. Having stayed well south of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t and the Y Bridge, the unit was still relatively fresh. After 30 minutes of fighting that left 6 Americans dead and over two dozen more wounded, the Americans pulled back to reorganize. A short time later, Schmalhorst landed Companies A and C, 6/31st Infantry, on Route 5A just north of where Companies A and C, 5/60th Infantry, were taking care of their casualties and restocking ammunition. The four companies waited there on the road for several hours while bombs and shells hammered the hamlet. When Schmalhorst‚Äôs troops resumed their advance late that afternoon, they faced only sporadic sniper fire as they moved down the highway. When they entered the hamlet, all they found were a few dazed and wounded VC soldiers. According to those prisoners, the 508th Battalion was headed for the deserted village of Da Phuoc () two kilometers to the south. Darkness ruled out an immediate pursuit, but Schmalhorst resolved to regain contact at first light. On the morning of 11 May, the survivors from the Phu Loi I Battalion abandoned C·∫ßu M·∫≠t and began moving south. Most slipped away while it was still dark, clinging to the dense foliage that lined rivers and streams as they marched south. One group of 50 soldiers made the mistake of lingering in C·∫ßu M·∫≠t until daylight. The early dawn light was enough to reveal their location, and within minutes an artillery strike destroyed the group. Soldier from Company \\"B\\", 2nd Battalion, 47th Infantry searching a house for VC, 13 May 1968 Meanwhile, Schmalhorst resumed his pursuit of the 508th Battalion. He sent Company C, 6/31st Infantry to check the nearby hamlet of Da Phouc where the VC had reportedly gone during the night. When they approached the abandoned community, they came under heavy fire from VC troops who were dug in along the bank of a stream. The Americans quickly realized this was no mere rear guard; the VC was throwing everything he had into the fight. RPGs, heavy machine-gun fire, and mortar shells flew at Company C. The volume of fire hardly diminished even when precise air and artillery strikes began to explode among the VC positions. Schmalhorst inserted by helicopter Company D, 6/31st Infantry, fresh from the battalion base camp, onto the far side of Da Phouc. When it advanced toward the stream to hit the VC from behind, a contingent from the 508th Battalion turned their weapons around and prevented the trap from closing. The firefight continued well into the evening as air strikes and artillery shells lit up the sky. In the early hours of 12 May, the 508th Battalion broke contact and continued its retreat south. Companies C and D lost a total of 2 dead and 20 wounded in the battle for Da Phuoc. The VC completed their evacuation of the Eighth District on 12 May. A few stragglers fell to the 3/39th Infantry and the 2/47th Infantry, as they swept through the ramshackle buildings and rice fields from C·∫ßu M·∫≠t to the Y Bridge. Others died from air and artillery strikes that chased the VC as they marched south. Aftermath The cost of the battle, especially to the Eighth District, had been high. Much of C·∫ßu M·∫≠t and Xom Ong Doi lay in ruins. At least 8,000 homes had been destroyed in the fighting and over a dozen square blocks of the city were a flattened wasteland. The cost of the battle for the VC was difficult to calculate. The 9th Infantry Division recorded a body count of 852 VC killed, but that figure is far too high considering that less than 1,000 VC soldiers were involved in the battle. A more likely body count is probably 200 to 250 killed in addition to a somewhat higher number of VC who were wounded. It is therefore reasonable to posit a total casualty rate for the four VC battalions somewhere between 50 and 75 percent.

Though some core tenets in the Sikh religion are understood to emphasise peace and nonviolence, especially before the 1606 execution of Guru Arjan by Mughal emperor Jahangir, military force may be justified if all peaceful means to settle a conflict have been exhausted, thus resulting in a dharamyudh.  Etymology  The first part of the term dharamyudh comes from Punjabi dharm or dharam (‡®ß‡®∞‡®Æ), which is usually translated as 'religion', although it is said to 'encapsulate a wider understanding of appropriate conduct, moral order, and bodily discipline' than the words 'religion' and 'religious practice' in English do. It is derived from Sanskrit dh√°rma (‡§ß‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ),Dhavan, pp. 14‚Äì15. which has various possible meanings including 'morality', 'justice', 'law', 'religion', 'devotion' and 'sacrifice'. The second part is a cognate of Hindi yuddh (‡§Ø‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß, meaning 'war'), derived from Sanskrit yuddh√° (‡§Ø‡•Å‡§¶‡•ç‡§ß, meaning 'battle', 'fight' or 'war'). The meaning of the term dharamyudh appears to have been somewhat ambiguous in the writings of the early Sikh Gurus, ranging from 'an interior, individual, spiritual struggle' to 'a war to defend one's beliefs', but by the 18th century, it was increasingly interpreted as 'a religiously sanctioned war against Muslims in particular', which scholars attribute to the changing political circumstances that the Sikhs found themselves in, or moved themselves into. Hinduism also has a similar concept called dharma-yuddha that appears several times in the Mahabharatha.  History  = Militarisation of Sikhism (17th century) = Sikhism, founded in the late 15th century by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region, which was conquered by the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century, is generally considered to have been pacifist until the early 17th century. Perceiving the growth of the Sikhs as a threat, the Mughal authorities began to persecute them, and in 1606 Sikh leader Guru Arjan was executed by Mughal emperor Jahangir, apparently for refusing to convert to Islam, though this remains disputed. Sikhism split into two movements: one led by Guru Arjan's son Guru Hargobind began to regard Guru Arjan as a martyr, became more political and militaristic, and started organising armed rebellions against the Mughals; the other led by Guru Arjan's older brother Prithi Chand focused on peace and nonviolence, and rejected uprisings. The radicalised Sikhs justified violence as 'self-defence' against Mughal oppression,Syan, pp. 8‚Äì10. trained themselves to become warriors or nihang, and organised themselves in jathas. In 1621, the first acts of open rebellion led to the eruption of the Mughal-Sikh Wars. = Sikh imperialism (1716‚Äì1849) = Akali Sikh warriors, one carrying a flag, one on horseback.19th-century Akali Sikh warriors. Over the course of several decades, small Sikh states known as misls combined to form the Sikh Confederacy in 1716, that jointly fought against Mughal power. Professionalisation of combat led the last Guru Gobind Singh to create the Khalsa, a special class of Sikh warriors, in 1699.Fenech, p. 178. In 1735, the jathas would be merged into a single army, the Dal Khalsa. During the Afghan‚ÄìSikh Wars, the Sikhs expanded even further and in 1799 the Sikh Empire was founded, which would last until 1849, when it was defeated and annexed by the British East India Company.Fenech, p. 37. Sikh warriors would continue to serve in the British Indian army. = Modern militancy (1970s‚Äìpresent) = In the second half of the 20th century, the separatist Khalistan movement emerged, demanding an independent Sikh state in Indian Punjab. The main political party, Akali Dal, used the term Dharam Yudh Morcha (morcha meaning 'agitation') to rally Sikh nationalists in their campaigning, especially in 1982. Hereafter, several years of violence committed by Sikh militants to achieve their demands followed.Chima, p. 71. In June 1984, the conflict reached its zenith during Operation Blue Star, when Indian security forces stormed the holiest Sikh site, the Golden Temple in Amritsar, where Khalistan militants had set up their headquarters.Encarta- encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993‚Äì2002) s.v. \\"Sikhs. ¬ß3.

Another attraction is the plant from the former Satteinser Sch√§fle brewery which was shut down in 1917 and was purchased by Heinz Huber in 1989.  History  The museum's name Mohren Biererlebniswelt is linked to the brewery of the same name: Mohrenbrauerei. The name derives from Josef Mohr, who operated a tavern in Dornbirn in 1784 with an attached brewery which he called \\"Zum Mohren\\". On May 1, 1834 Franz-Anton Huber took over the tavern along with the brewery and kept the name.  The building  The museum was built from early 2015 to late 2016 by the architecture office h√§mmerle.tschikof GmbH. The exhibition space stretches over 700 square meters on four floors.

He is also remembered for his work in journalism and film, alongside his brother Manuel Trujillo Dur√°n. He worked as editor for several Maracaibo-based publications and published some collections of poetry. In politics, he first served in the government of Zulia before entering the National Assembly, where he was Vice-President on two occasions. In 1930, he was awarded one of the highest honors for civilian services to Venezuela, being made a Grand Officer of the Order of the Liberator.  Early and personal life  Guillermo Trujillo Dur√°n was born in Maracaibo, Zulia, on 10 February 1878, to Jos√© Trinidad Trujillo and Mar√≠a del Carmen Dur√°n. He had a brother, Manuel, with whom he was always very close. Manuel was a contemporary of Ud√≥n P√©rez, who would become a famous poet, at school. In adulthood, the brothers and P√©rez were friends, with P√©rez and Guillermo often seen together at one of Maracaibo's popular artists' meeting places, a refreshment shop in Baralt Plaza. As poets, P√©rez and Trujillo were considered of the same class. He also studied pharmacy at the University of Zulia, but did not graduate.  Career  Trujillo was the director of the magazines El rayo de luz and Gutenberg, both founded by his brother. The studio that these operated out of was at 6 Venezuela Street in downtown Maracaibo, opposite the Baralt Theatre and next to P√©rez. Trujillo became a member of the Venezuelan Academy of Language on August 30 1952, where he sat in chair Y; was on the editorial board of five other magazine and newspapers; and was also the Vice President of the Literary Center of Zulia. Some of his best work was notable for winning literature competitions. He then took a job as director of the magazine for the Ministry of Development, and moved to Caracas for this role for several years. In 1957 a compilation of many of his works was published in a book called Prism. Jes√∫s Ang√©l Sempr√∫n Parra describes Trujillo's work as: = Cinema = Trujillo's brother Manuel learned to operate film projectors through an associate, Luis Manuel M√©ndez. From this role, many sources credited Manuel and sometimes both Manuel and Guillermo as the creators of the first Venezuelan films. The films are titled Un c√©lebre especialista sacando muelas en el gran Hotel Europa and Muchachos ba√±√°ndose en el lago de Maracaibo; the narrative nature and early production of the films is a matter of pride across Venezuela and particularly in the state of Zulia; the day of the films' premiere, 28 January, is both National Day of Cinema and the \\"Day of Zulian Identity\\" in the state. = Politics = At one point, Trujillo was the general secretary in the government of Zulia, and then became the deputy for Zulia in Venezuela's National Assembly, serving between 1914 and 1939. He was a deputy over five periods, and for two of these was the Vice President of the National Assembly. He also held various positions overseeing and inspecting trade and highways in Venezuela.

Prior to this, Ghazi took part in the Conquest of Gour in 1303. Background and origin During Shah Jalal's expedition towards the Indian subcontinent from Hadhramaut in Yemen, Jalal came across Haydar who joined him in his journey. However, it is unknown whereabouts in the Middle East that Haydar is exactly from. There is some debate of what his real name is. Syed Murtaza Ali suggests that his name was Saeedi al-Husayni. Other sources mention Saeed al-Husayni and Saeed al-Hasani. Career After Shah Jalal was summoned by the Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah to take part in the Conquest of Sylhet against Raja Gour Govinda, Haydar and the other companions joined him. Following the death of Sylhet's wazir Sikandar Khan Ghazi, Sylhet became leaderless. Shah Jalal himself then appointed Haydar Ghazi as the second wazir to rule over Sylhet. It is unknown how long Haydar's governorship was but historians estimate his term finished some time after the death of Shah Jalal which was in 1346. The next known Wazir of Sylhet was Muqabil Khan who ruled in 1440. After his rule in Sylhet, Haydar moved to Sonargaon where he spent the rest of his life. His mazar remains in Sonargaon (in Dhaka Division). Legacy Haydar Ghazi's descendant by the name of Shaikh 'Ali Sher Bangali wrote a book called Commentary on the excursion of the souls () which contained one of the earliest biographies of Shah Jalal. However, Muhammad Mojlum Khan is of the solitary opinion that the biography was written by Haydar Ghazi himself, under his pen name Shaykh Noorul Huda Abul Karamat. The latter is most likely an error as the book was written in 1571, 2 centuries after the time of Haydar Ghazi. The Sharh written by Ali Sher is a primary source which inspired the later and more well-known - Gulzar-i-Abrar - a collection of Sufi saint biographies written by Muhammad Ghauth Shattari of Mandvi in 1613.

Biography  Professor of mathematics in high schools since 1976, Laumond defended his thesis in robotics at the Paul Sabatier University in Toulouse in 1984 on methods for structuring the evolution space of a mobile robot. He joined the CNRS in 1985. He spent his entire career at the Laboratoire d'analyse et d'architecture des syst√®mes (LAAS). until February 2019, when he joined the CNRS-INRIA-ENS UMR 8548 joint unit. He has carried out numerous research projects on the planning and control of the movement of mechanical systems and in particular humanoid robots. He co-directed the CNRS-AIST JRL French-Japanese humanoid robotics laboratory in Toulouse from 2005 to 2008. He is the co-founder of the start-up Kineo-Cam, which he led for two years and which received several innovation awards before being acquired by Siemens in 2012..  Scientific work  Laumond defines himself as a geometer of robotics. With a mathematical background, his career is dominated by the algorithm of motion planning in robotics, a scientific field for which he helped to lay the foundations. His research covers the planning and motion control of autonomous machines, and covers various disciplinary fields (graph theory, algorithmic geometry, non- linear control, optimal control, differential geometry, probabilistic algorithmics, neuroscience) applied to mobile robotics and humanoid robotics. From a disciplinary perspective, his contributions focused on: * graph theory (connectivity studies, drawing planar graphs, graph Hamiltonicity) * obstacle magnification, collision detection) * non-linear control (constructive evidence of local small time controllability, nilpotentization of single systems, optimal control for non-holonomic systems) * differential geometry (non-holonomic metrics and estimation of degrees of non- holonomy) * probabilistic algorithms (complexity analysis, control of sampling and diffusion methods) * neuroscience (studies of human locomotion) Three stages structure his activity at the end of his thesis which focused on the structuring of the space of a mobile robot by decomposing planar graphsJ.P.

Laumond, ¬´ Motion planning and control for Hilare pulling a trailer ¬ª, IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, vol.15, n. 4, 1999, p. 640-652.

Piano Mover[1996-2004] - In the early 1990s, when deterministic approaches were not able to cope with the combinatorial complexity inherent in the so-called 'piano mover' problem, new paradigms of resolution appeared, first and foremost at Stanford and Utrecht universities. This is the beginning of probabilistic methods. He contributes to the movement in collaboration with his colleague T. Sim√©on, both theoretically (introduction of an original mechanism for controlling random sampling methodsT. Sim√©on, J.P. Laumond, C. Nissoux, ¬´ Visibility based probabilistic roadmaps for motion planning ¬ª, Advanced Robotics Journal, vol. 14, n. 6, 2000) and practically through the development of a generic software platform, a platform that was to be enhanced in 2000 with the creation of the start-up Kineo CAMJ.P.

It was acquired by Siemens in 2012. Anthropomorphic systems[2001-Present] - After being made available to create Kineo CAM, he resumed his research activity in 2003. It then begins a new theme: movement planning for digital actors. The first results appear in 2003 (an avatar is able to walk while manipulating a cumbersome object and avoiding obstacles) in the graph communityJ. Pettr√©, J.P.

The first relations were established in 2004 with researchers working in humanoid robotics at the AIST in Japan. These first contacts led to the humanoid robotics activity at LAAS, the acquisition by CNRS of the HRP2 platform and the relocation of the associated international laboratory JRL, which he co- directed from 2005 to 2008.

She has exhibited in numerous institutions across the world. In 2017 she received the Golden Nica award at the Ars Electronica festival for her K-9_topology series. In this opus, which consist of four projects ('Ecce Canis', 'I Hunt Nature and Culture Hunts Me', 'Hybrid Family', and 'ARTE_mis') she addressed the topics of parallel evolution of human and dog. From 2008 she is a featured artist and production partner of Kapelica Gallery in Ljubljana. In her artistic work she often employs biotechnological tools, meaning that her art works are often created in laboratory settings in which she collaborated with scientists and technologists. Hence, she is sometimes regarded as a laboratory-based bio- artist, along with the artists like Eduardo Kac, Joe Davis, Marta de Menezes and Paul Vanouse. She is known for uncovering and addressing difficult bioethical problems and dilemmas in her work, especially related to the position of the human species at the top and center of the ecosystem (anthropocentrism), the ambiguities of current and future biotechnological practices and the concept of the post-human world.

In his murders, Zingerle had specially-equipped caves in the Tyrolean mountains, where he would abduct and then rape his victims. He killed by burying his victims under a pile of stones to let them die in days of agony, which he often observed. After the Second World War, he moved to Innsbruck in Austria.  Murders  Zingerle's first confirmed victim was the young teacher Gertrud Kutin (sister of Helmut Kutin, Honorary Director of the SOS Children's Villages) from Bolzano, whom he kidnapped in Glaning in May 1946. He raped and then buried her under heavy stones, until she painfully passed away several days later. Shortly thereafter, he raped a 15-year-old girl from Karneid, whom he also buried with rocks, but she managed to free herself. In 1947, two women escaped as well, after being trapped and raped for several days; Zingerle was imprisoned for a year for these crimes. Three years later, he raped and murdered an English tourist in Iss, on the eastern slope of the Patscherkofel in Austria.  Arrest and detention  In August 1950, after five weeks of prosection by the police from both North and South Tyrol, Zingerle was placed in an alpine hut near Vals. After trials in Bolzano and Innsbruck, he was sentenced to multiple counts of life imprisonment. On August 9, 1962, Zingerle died from liver cancer in the Turi prison.  Aftermath  Guido Zingerle was known as the epitome of evil in the region for decades, with parents often using the educational formula \\"If you are not good, then Zingerle will get you.\\" against rebellious children. In 2010, the play \\"Gemma Zingerle schaugn\\" was premiered in Absam, by author Gertraud Lener.

The 11.5 km-long standard-gauge line on the Flamatt‚ÄìLaupen‚ÄìG√ºmmenen route through the Sense valley was opened on 20 January 1904. The shares of the company were acquired by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and Swiss Post (34 %) in 2001. Since then, the infrastructure of the Sense Valley Railway has been operated by the SBB under contract. CHF 200 on 1 December 1903  Rolling stock Initially, the train traffic was hauled by Ed 3/4 steam-locomotives. They were too heavy and were replaced by so-called glass boxes, Ed 2/2 steam locomotives. A Kittel steam railcar built in Esslingen in 1908 and originally owned by the Prussian military railway was purchased in 1921. (factory no. 3469) With the electrification of the line, the railway procured a CFe 2/4 101 railcar from SWS and SAAS. Until it was delivered in December, the STB rented Ce 4/4 13502, an MFO test locomotive for electric operations on the Seebach‚ÄìWettingen line, along with railcars, from the SBB. Locomotive 13502 was purchased in 1940 and was then used as Ce 4/4 1. It was sold to the SBB in 1964, so that it could be exhibited in the Swiss Museum of Transport. The railway company bought an ABe 4/4 railcar from the Swiss Southeastern Railway (Schweizerischen S√ºdostbahn; SOB) in both 1958 and 1964, which were used as Be 4/4 nos. 106 and 107. These were supplemented in 1974 with converted control car Bti 201, which had been acquired from the Bern‚ÄìL√∂tschberg‚ÄìSimplon railway (BLS). The last railcars of the STB, BDe 4/6 102 and 103, which had been built in 1938, were taken over from the BLS in 1985. Their old age soon became noticeable and the last trains of the STB included a push-pull train rented from the Sihltal Z√ºrich Uetliberg Bahn (SZU). Diesel locomotives Tm 238 111 and 114, which had been retained for freight traffic, were sold to the SBB in 2000. 22E22STBi.jpg\\"Glass boxes\\" Ed 2/2 22 STB Ce 4-4 1.jpgCe 4/4 1 \\"Marianne\\" WM BDe 2-4 3 Arth-Goldau 230509.jpgBDe 2/4 101, here operated as \\"Dame du L√©man\\" of the Museumsbahn Compagnie ferroviaire du L√©man STB-Be 4-4 106.JPGBe 4/4 106 in G√ºmmenen STB BDe 4-6 102.JPGBDe 4/6 102 VHE Ed 3-4 2 Huttwil 2013-10-05.jpgEd 3/4 2 of the Solothurn‚ÄìMoutier railway, identical to Ed 3/4 31 and 32 of the Sense Valley railway  End of operations  View of the disused Sense Valley Railway to the G√ºmmenen Viaduct End of the line: the line from Bern to Laupen is served by the BLS. The railway line between Laupen and G√ºmmenen was closed on 23 May 1993 and replaced by buses. The trains only operated between Laupen and Flamatt. From 2001, the trains were operated by the SBB and from December 2004‚Äîwith the introduction of the Bern S-Bahn by BLS L√∂tschbergbahn, now BLS AG. Freight traffic was greatly reduced as a result of reduced production at the large Amcor Rentsch Laupen printing works, the closure of the oil reserve in Laupen and structural changes in industry. SBB Cargo has had no freight customers on the STB line since 2005. The closed route between G√ºmmenen and Laupen is now used for tourism. Rail-cycle draisines can be rented in Laupen to run on the track to G√ºmmenen. In front of the viaduct there is a picnic area where it is possible to turn the draisines around. The tracks were dismantled for about 60 metres at both ends in Laupen and G√ºmmenen, so the line is no longer passable by trains. The railway infrastructure between Flamatt and Laupen as well as a concession to operate railway infrastructure are still owned by the Sense Valley Railway Company, which is managed by SBB. BLS trains run every half hour to Laupen with trains crossing in Neuenegg. The former signal box built in 1966 was operated locally. A new signal box has been in operation since 13 April 2012. It was remotely controlled from Bern from 2012 to 2015 and has been subsequently controlled from Olten. There are plans to operate this in a simplified form (as a dead-end siding) to Laupen station so that the line would run only as far as the bridge over the Sense. Thus would eliminate one level crossing. In the autumn of 2014, all unprotected level crossings were closed and replaced by a new crossing at Freiburghaus equipped with a barrier system. Service was suspended between Flamatt and Laupen on December 16, 2019, to permit reconstruction of the route and its stations, including a completely new station at Laupen. SBB plans to resume service at the end of 2020.  Bus operations The Sense Valley Railway Company had concessions for the Th√∂rishaus‚ÄìNeuenegg‚ÄìLaupen‚ÄìG√ºmmenen and Kerzers‚ÄìGolaten‚ÄìWileroltigen‚ÄìGurbr√º bus routes. In addition, it operated a bus route on behalf of PostBus. * 30.130 Th√∂rishaus Dorf‚ÄìNeuenegg‚Äì(Laupen) * 30.541 Kerzers‚ÄìGolaten‚ÄìWileroltigen‚ÄìGurbr√º * 30.550 Laupen-G√ºmmenen * 30.560 M√ºhleberg‚ÄìAllenl√ºften‚ÄìRossh√§usern (on behalf of PostBus) These concessions were transferred to PostBus on 13 December 2009 and as a result the Sense Valley Railway withdrew from this business. The Sense Valley Railway also had licenses for the \\"Nightbird\\" night bus routes on the Z√ºrich‚ÄìLucerne, Brugg‚ÄìBasel and Brugg‚ÄìOlten routes.

He holds the South African Research Chair in Computational and Applied Mechanics in the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape Town, and is the Director of the Centre for Research in Computational and Applied Mechanics (CERECAM) there. He is President of the International Science Council.  Career  After completing a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Cape Town and a PhD degree at Cambridge University, Reddy pursued postdoctoral study at the University College London, then returned to Cape Town, where he migrated eventually from joint appointments in civil engineering and applied mathematics to a chair in applied mathematics. He served as dean of faculty of science at UCT for seven years from 1999, and thereafter was appointed to the South African Research Chair in Computational and Applied Mechanics. In 2018, Reddy has been elected as first President of the International Science Council.  Research  Reddy's teaching and research activities reflect his multidisciplinary perspectives, which he pursues largely through the Centre for Research in Computational and Applied Mechanics (CERECAM) at the University of Cape Town, a centre comprising academic staff and their students in five different departments, straddling the engineering disciplines, mathematics, and biomedical sciences. He has made major contributions to the analysis of problems in solid mechanics, most notably plasticity. He has developed and analysed new variational formulations, as well as associated solution algorithms, which have been implemented computationally, for both classical and gradient theories. The second area in which he has a substantial international reputation is in the development and analysis of mixed and related finite element methods. Beyond these major areas of activity, he has also made significant contributions to aspects of biomedical mechanics. He is the author, co-author or editor of around 200 publications, including two research monographs, two texts, and three edited volumes of invited papers. He has supervised to graduation 28 PhD and 36 Masters graduates, as well as 20 post-doctoral researchers. The objective of his graduate text was to address a great need, in providing graduate students and researchers in engineering as well as others who do not have the requisite mathematical background, with an introduction to the mathematics that is essential to the study of boundary value problems and the finite element method. The work continues to be used in universities around the world, either as recommenced course text or for individual study. The first edition of his research monograph, with Weimin Han, comprised a systematic treatment of mathematical aspects of classical plasticity from a modern perspective. The monograph captures the main results of the theoretical work by Reddy and co-authors over a number of years, and goes on to present some new results. The second edition includes new material on single-crystal plasticity and strain-gradient plasticity, to which Reddy has made significant contributions.  Scientific leadership  Reddy was a founder member in 2003, of the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), which has grown from its first institute in South Africa to become a pan-African network with centres for graduate education, research and outreach currently in six African countries. He currently serves as the chair of the AIMS South Africa council, and is a trustee on the AIMS Trust. He served a term as President of the Academy of Sciences of South Africa (ASSAf). The InterAcademy Partnership (IAP) is a global network of 140 member academies which work together to provide independent expert advise on scientific, technological and health issues. Reddy served, over the period 2013 - 2019 as co-chair of IAP-Policy, the arm of the IAP that mobilizes the best scientists and engineers worldwide to provide high-quality, in-depth advice to international organizations and national governments on critical scientific issues. In July 2018 he was elected the first president of the International Science Council, a body that has resulted from the merger of the International Council for Science (ICSU) and the International Social Science Council, and whose membership includes national and regional scientific organizations from 140 countries and 40 international scientific unions and associations. The ISC catalyses international scientific collaboration and convenes scientific and policy expertise, advise and influence on issues of major concern to science and society.  Awards  Reddy has the unique distinction of being an elected fellow or member of all four South African academies: the Academy of Science of South Africa (ASSAf), by legislation of the official academy of South Africa; the South African Academy of Engineering; the Royal Society of South Africa; and the Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns. He is also a Fellow of The World Academy of Sciences (TWAS), of the African Academy of Sciences, and a founding Fellow of the Developing World Academy of Engineering and Technology. Reddy is a recipient of the Award for Research Distinction of the South African Mathematical Society, the Order of Mapungubwe, awarded by the President of South Africa for distinguished contributions to science, and of the Georg Forster Research Award from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation in Germany. He was elected a Fellow on the International Association for Computational Mechanics in 2008.

HAPSMobile is developing the Hawk30 solar-powered unmanned aircraft for stratospheric telecommunications. It has a strategic relationship with Loon LLC, a subsidiary of Google's parent Alphabet Inc. Hawk30 HAPSMobile Hawk30 = Development = On January 3, 2018, AeroVironment announced it would design and develop a solar-powered, high-altitude, unmanned aircraft and associated ground control stations for a joint venture with Japanese telco SoftBank (95%) for $65 million. In November 2018, the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB in California was selected to provide ground and range safety for the project up to 10,000 ft for $791,600. On April 25, 2019, the stratospheric Hawk30 was rolled out for the joint venture. Commercial operations are expected to begin in 2023, operating year-round at latitudes 30¬∞ north and south of the equator. AeroVironment's design development investment increased by $39 million to $129 million, and a later Hawk50 model would allow operations from 50¬∞ north and south of the equator, to cover Japan and North America. The same day, SoftBank invested $125 million in Loon, a subsidiary of Google parent Alphabet, that has been developing high-altitude balloons for internet connectivity since 2011. It will make a similar investment in HAPSMobile, collaborating on common ground stations, communications payloads and can share network connectivity in flight. HAPSMobile could also use the Loon-developed fleet management system and software-defined network. In August 2019, the FAA allowed the HAWK30 to fly in the stratosphere above Hawaii in FY2019, within the Pan-Pacific UAS Test Range Complex. On September 11, the prototype Hawk30 first flew at low altitude in restricted airspace at the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center. Stratospheric flight tests up to 65,000 ft are expected to start before March 31, 2020, from the Hawaiian island of Lanai. Built in Simi Valley, California, the HAWK30 made its first flight and was tested at the Spaceport America in New Mexico instead, as the local Economic Development Department provided $500,000 in subsidies. On 21-22 September 2020, the HAPSMobile Hawk30 (rebranded as Sunglider) flew 20 hours from Spaceport America, and reached an altitude of on its fifth demonstration flight. It tested the long-distance LTE communications developed with Loon for standard LTE smartphones and wireless broadband communications. = Design = The Hawk30 flying-wing is a development of the NASA Pathfinder and NASA Helios high-altitude, long- endurance unmanned aircraft built by AeroVironment for NASA. Resembling the 1999 Helios, the tailless aircraft is a span flying wing with 10 electric- driven propellers. Orbiting at , it is solar-powered by day and battery- powered by night to stay aloft for up to six months initially. The aircraft's service life is planned to be two years and its time on station may be extended by 1-2 months with experience. The aircraft will be remotely piloted for the ascent and descent, and operate autonomously once cruising in the stratosphere. The HAWK30 cruises at 59 kn (110 km/h). The system would provide 4G LTE and 5G direct to devices over a 200 km (125 mi) diameter area, and 40 aircraft could cover the entire Japanese archipelago. It should be interoperable with terrestrial cell towers to expand their coverage and as a proxy for the SoftBank-backed OneWeb satellite constellation, when it is not suited for providing links directly to devices.

The ball combines classical traditions with contemporary impulses from the field of science communication. Since its foundation in 2015, it has become one of the largest balls in the Viennese ball season History The ball was founded in 2015 based on an initiative of the then mayor of Vienna, Michael H√§upl, and the University Commissioner of the city of Vienna, Alexander Van der Bellen. Their concern was to position Vienna more clearly as a site for science. The attempt to legitimize xenophobic, anti-semitic and racist ideas in the university environment with the help of the so-called Akademikerball - organized by Burschenschaften (a form of German nationalist fraternities) and the right-wing FP√ñ party - was an additional motive for the establishment of the Vienna Ball of Sciences, which can be seen as a contraposition. Under the initiative of H√§upl, Van der Bellen and then City Councilor Andreas Mailath-Pokorny, science manager and science communicator Oliver Lehmann started the conception of the ball in the summer of 2014. Lehmann also chairs the club \\"Wien Wissen\\", which is responsible for organization, content and accounts. The first Vienna Ball of Sciences took place on January 31, 2015. Since its foundation, the Science Ball has traditionally been held on the last Saturday in January within the festival halls of the Vienna City Hall. Slogan and programme Since it started, \\"Decent Fun - Dance with an Attitude\\" has been the motto of the Vienna Ball of Sciences. The ball programme combines classical elements of a traditional dance ball with contemporary forms of presentations in the field of science and art. The protagonists stem from Viennese universities and research institutions. Traditional components of a ball such as the opening by the Young Women and Young Men's Committee, the Midnight Quadrille and the table decoration are enhanced by scientific content. Hence, to exemplify, in 2018 a fashion show with models that had been inspired by experiments in the field of molecular biology took place; in 2019, the use of a thermal imaging camera in the ball discotheque followed to visualize the temperature profiles of ball guests. Honorary committee Rectors of all Viennese universities, private universities, colleges of education and technical colleges form the honorary committee. As of 2019, the committee will stand under the patronage of Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen; EU-commissioner Johannes Hahn, mayor Michael Ludwig, the minister of science, and city councillor Veronica Kaup- Hasler head the honorary committee. Ball ambassadors People from the scientific community, science communication or from other areas of society such as politics, economics and culture with a connection to science are chosen to serve as ambassadors. =List of ball ambassadors (selection)= * Michael K√∂hlmeier (2019), writer and student of mathematics * Julia Ebner (2019), extremism and terrorism researcher, Research Fellow at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, London * Herbert Edelsbrunner (2019), American- Austrian computer scientist and mathematician (IST Austria), Wittgenstein awardee 2018 * Ursula Hemetek (2019), ethnomusicologist (Universit√§t f√ºr Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien) and Wittgenstein awardee 2018 * Nuno Maulide (2018), chemist (University of Vienna), ERC-awardee and Austria's scientist 2018 * Giulia Enders (2018), physician and author (\\"Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body's Most Underrated Organ\\") * Giulio Superti-Furga (2017), molecular biologist, head of CeMM, part of the Austrian Academy of Sciences * Martin Nowak (2017), Professor for biology and mathematics, head of the evolution dynamics programme at Harvard University * Helga Nowotny (2015), head of the ERA Council Forum Austria and former ERC-president * Josef Penninger (2015), molecular biologist, former scientific head of IMBA, Wittgenstein awardee 2014 * Anton Zeilinger (2015), quantum physicist, president of the Austrian Academy of Sciences Guests of honor Marc Abrahams, founder of the Ig nobel prize was guest of honour for the first ball in 2015, @NeinQuarterly journalist Eric Jarosinski in 2016.

Kenya, possibly through to the 18th century. A community known as the Yaaku later moved into their territory and the Mukogodo, adopted the Yaaku language, referred to as Yaakunte. The Yaaku community was later assimilated by a food producing population and they lost their way of life. Their language, Yaakunte, was kept alive for some time by the Mukogodo who had all along maintained their own hunter-gathering way of life. However, the Mukogodo were later immersed into the Maasai culture and adopted the Maa language. The Yaakunte language is today facing extinction but is undergoing a revival movement. In the present time, the terms Yaaku and Mukogodo (sometimes Mukogodo Maasai), are used to refer to a population living in Mukogodo forest west of Mount Kenya. Etymology The name Mukogodo is a Yaakunte word meaning people who live in rocks. History =Origins= According to Mukogodo traditions recorded by Mhando (2008), the Mukogodo people are ancestral to Mount Kenya. At the very least their traditions do not go further back than their presence in that region. =Yaaku interaction= The territory of the original Mukogodo was impinged upon by a community referred to as Yaaku. The Yaaku practiced a herding and cultivation way of life. They spoke a Cushitic language that is today called Yaakunte. Way of life =Subsistnce= At the time of Mukogodo and Yaaku interaction, the latter lived by hunting and gathering. An area of particular focus appears to have been bee-keeping, a heritage maintained by the Mukogodo Maasai today. =Shelter= The Mukogodo made their homes in caves hence the appellation applied to them. =Tools= The main tools of the Mukogodo hunter were his bow and arrows. The latter which were carried in wooden quivers with leather lids and shoulder straps. Their shafts were made from a reedy plant and were fitted with iron tips. These tips were purchased in trade with their neighbors as the Mukogodo had no blacksmiths of their own. =Trade= The Mukogodo hunted rhinoceros for their horn, which they traded with their neighbors for livestock, crops, and manufactured goods like beads and iron. Mukogodo assimilation The Mukogodo appear to have lived in association with the Yaaku in that the Mukogodo in whose localities the Yaaku settled, adopted the Yaakunte language. However, they maintained their hunter-gathering way of life. Language decline The Mukogodo/Yaaku acclimated to the pastoralist culture of the Maasai in the first half of the twentieth century (1920's and 30's), although some still keep bees. The reason for this transition is mostly one of social prestige. The Maasai look down upon hunter-gatherer peoples, calling them Dorobo ('the ones without cattle'), and many Mukogodo/Yaaku consider the Maasai culture superior to their own. =Adoption of Maasai language= As a result of the decision to transition to pastoralism, the Mukogodo/Yaaku largely gave up their Cushitic language Yaaku for the Eastern Nilotic Maasai language between 1925 and 1936. =Yaakunte revival= *Yaaku language, for details of the language and revival movement Yaaku today In the present time, both the terms Yaaku and Mukogodo, sometimes Mukogodo Maasai are used to refer to a population living in Mukogodo forest west of Mount Kenya.

The boat was ordered by Robert Miller with the particular goal of winning sailing records. The designers were Greg Elliott and Clay Oliver. The yacht has waterline length of 40.2 m, a width of 9.6 m, and a displacement of 50 t. It was equipped with a canting keel with a 10 t keel bulb, which is able to exert a much larger righting moment then a conventional keel. On October 9, 2003, Mari-Cha IV improved the previous record for fastest west-east transatlantic passage by a sailing monohull by more than two days, with total time of 6 days, 17h, 15m and 39s. During the run, she also won the record for longest 24h distance sailed, with 525.5 nautical miles. This record was only broken 13 years later, in 2016, by Comanche. Mari-Cha IV gained particular distinction in 2005, when she broke the 100-year-old record for fastest monohull Atlantic crossing under regatta conditions (as opposed to solo runs, where the team can wait for optimal weather projections), previously established by Atlantic under Charlie Barr during the 1905 Kaiser's Cup. During the 2005 Rolex Transatlantic Challenge she beat out Maximus for line honours and set the new record of 9 days, 15 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds. In July 2004, the yacht also won the record for the fastest passage from the US west coast to Hawaii. In year 2015 the yacht was renamed Samurai and converted to a fast luxury cruiser. The canting keel was replaced by a simpler retracting keel, and the ship was given a new cabin and interior.

It is served by Scotscalder railway station which is operated by Abellio ScotRail. The B870 runs directly through the centre with Achagie and Thurso to the north and Olgrinmore and Westerdale to the south. It is operated under the Highland Authority. A small car park, with 2 spaces, can be found at Scotscalder railway station that is open, free, 24 hours a day. There are no bus services operating from Scotscalder however a short walk or train journey can take you to local travel services. Historic discoveries There are several historic archaeological discoveries in the area surrounding Scotscalder ranging from the Romans to the Celts suggesting that there have been settlements here for millennia. Artefacts that are believed to date from the Iron Age have been found within the Scotscalder area. Railway station Scotscalder railway station is a request stop on the Far North Line and has trains running in both directions towards Wick in the North and Inverness further South. You can change at Wick railway station for services to Thurso railway station. Passenger numbers have decreased annually to a record low for 2018. This makes it one of the least used stations in the whole of the UK and the least used on the Far North Line Local area The local area surrounding and within Scotscalder is relatively small. There a few small settlements and farms in the area and the River Thurso runs nearby. The road that runs through Scotscalder is only wide enough to fit one car but has several passing places. 3 miles north of Scotscalder, via the B870 you can find Loch Calder and 8 miles north of Scotscalder will take you into Thurso. Within Scotscalder itself there isn't much. The nearest Post Office and other amenities can be found in Halkirk, five miles up the road. Walking from one place to another isn't advised due to lack of footpaths and long distances between villages sometimes. Local history Scotscalder's local area as it is known today was shaped by the Far North Line opening in 1874. The station is still standing and is the centrepiece of the area. Further settlements were constructed as the railway allowed businesses to make the most of the generally flat land that was available. It also allowed easy travel to Thurso, Wick and Inverness. The construction of the road, which possibly previously existed as a farm track or pack-horse route also allowed easy access to the nearby village of Halkirk where products could be sold locally.

The EP was released on 20 November 2018 through Polydor Records. The EP includes the singles \\"Leave Fast\\", \\"Dead Boys\\" and \\"That Sound\\". Background Talking about the EP, Rough Trade said, \\"There's an edge to Fender's songs that can also make him tremble. The surging, urgent Dead Boys deals explicitly with male suicide and mental health issues, and has caused outpourings of emotion among a growing band of followers. All of Sam‚Äôs songs tend to feature a resonance and socially-aware, socially-pertinent message. It's what helps to define him, and makes him leap-frog the endless slew of winsome singer- songwriters that sound fine, but have precisely nothing to say for themselves. Leave Fast is slower, plaintive chords allowing lines about boy racers, sand dunes and shitty pubs to bring the stark images of Fender‚Äôs hometown to life. The spiky riffing on Poundshop Kardashians finds Fender struggling to make sense of vacuous celebrity and the throwaway nature of vast swathes of modern culture. The Dead Boys EP finds space for a thank you to music itself. His next gambit, the seismic That Sound, wriggles and bangs through a melody that supports the big-hearted idea that music keeps Sam Fender on the straight and narrow. It‚Äôs always been his only viable option.\\" Critical reception Dominic Lee from The Courier, gave the EP a positive review, stating, \\"I was wrong about Sam Fender. He's the real deal. Dead Boys blows my mind every time I listen to it. The Prelude opens with a beautiful arpeggio guitar segment overlayed with cascading strings and Sam‚Äôs distant vocals crying out in an almost hymn-like introduction before the guitar deepens in the transition to the title track. Dead Boys is an anthem for men in the modern world, an introspective look into the very real world of male suicide and how this is often overlooked. Fender shows real lyrical talent on this track, resonating with issues that many men- and people in general- are often reluctant to talk about and bringing them to the forefront of his music.\\" Track listing Charts { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Chart (2018) ! scope=\\"col\\" Peak position - ! scope=\\"row\\" UK Vinyl Albums (OCC)  37 } Release history { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Country ! scope=\\"col\\" Release date ! scope=\\"col\\" Format ! scope=\\"col\\" Label - ! scope=\\"row\\" United Kingdom  20 November 2018   Polydor Records } References Category:2018 EPs Category:Sam Fender albums Category:Polydor Records albums ","title":"Dead Boys (EP)"},{"id":"61792861","text":"Running Against the Wind is a 2019 Ethiopian drama film directed by Jan Philipp Weyl.

The oratorio Die Sch√∂pfung (The Creation), sung by Judith Raskin, John Reardon, Alexander Young and the Camerata Singers, was first released in 1968. The Harmoniemesse (Wind Band Mass), sung by Judith Blegen, Simon Estes, Kenneth Riegel, Frederica von Stade and the Westminster Choir, was first released in 1975. Recording Die Sch√∂pfung was recorded using analogue technology on 17, 18 and 20 May 1966 in the Philharmonic Hall ‚Äì since renamed the Avery Fisher Hall ‚Äì in the Lincoln Center, New York City. The Harmoniemesse was recorded using analogue quadraphonic (four-channel) technology in February 1973 in the Manhattan Center, also in New York City.Haydn, Joseph: Die Sch√∂pfung & Harmoniemesse, cond. Leonard Bernstein, Sony CD, SM2K 47560, 1992 Packaging The cover of the album, designed by C. C. Garbers, features a photograph by Lesley Donald of a 1991 watercolour by the Prince of Wales: View of Ben Avon, Balmoral. (The back of the album credits the painting to A. G. Carrick Ltd, a company set up by the Prince of Wales to exploit his intellectual property rights for the benefit of The Prince of Wales's Charitable Fund. A. G.

Also on the album's cover are a photograph of Bernstein by Ludwig Schirmer and a photograph of the Prince by dpa/Camera Press. Critical reception =Reviews= Thomas Hardy in 1791 Alec Robertson reviewed Die Sch√∂pfung on LP in Gramophone in January 1969, comparing Bernstein's recording with what he considered to be the best of its predecessors, a 1968 Decca album conducted by Karl M√ºnchinger.Haydn, Joseph: Die Sch√∂pfung, cond. Karl M√ºnchinger, Decca LP, SET 362-3, !968 In the work's Introduction, Haydn's depiction of the world's primordial chaos, M√ºnchinger, he wrote, offered \\"mystery and awe\\", Bernstein drama and colour. In Bernstein's recording, \\"God was not so much moving over the face of the water as being moved\\", driven across it by the conductor. This contrast between M√ºnchinger's and Bernstein's approaches continued when the archangel Raphael began his narration. Where M√ºnchinger's Tom Krause sang \\"in hushed tones\\", Bernstein's John Reardon sang \\"loudly, and so [destroyed] the atmosphere just created\\". Matters improved on Bernstein's album when Alexander Young delivered Uriel's \\"Now vanish before the holy beams\\", Bernstein laudably animating a \\"rhythmic vitality... admirably suited to this work\\". Young's virile singing and the more lyrical performance of M√ºnchinger's Werner Krenn were both enjoyable in their own way. As the soprano archangel, Gabriel, M√ºnchinger's Elly Ameling was unequivocally better than Bernstein's Judith Raskin, with \\"more variation of tone\\" and \\"more sensitive feeling\\" than the American. The albums' rival choirs and orchestras all had much to commend them. Bernstein's Camerata Singers sang with \\"great enjoyment and excellent tone\\"; M√ºnchinger's Vienna State Opera Chorus with superior diction. Similarly, where Bernstein's New York Philharmonic provided \\"finely pointed orchestral detail\\", M√ºnchinger's Vienna Philharmonic had a string section that the Americans could not equal. Bernstein's album was better engineered than M√ºnchinger's, offering \\"bright recording\\", \\"great clarity\\" and \\"excellent balance\\". In sum, though, even if Bernstein's release gave \\"considerable pleasure and [had] a great deal to recommend it\\", M√ºnchinger's version was the more desirable of the two overall.Robertson, Alec: Gramophone, January 1969, p. 1033 Eug√®ne Delacroix's painting (circa 1826) of the elderly, blind John Milton dictating Paradise Lost to his daughters Richard Freed reviewed the Harmoniemesse on LP in Stereo Review in September 1975. \\"There can be few scores of any kind\\", he wrote, \\"whose vigour, joy and unlaboured exaltation find so close a parallel in the characteristics of Bernstein's music-making.\\" All four vocal soloists sang well, particularly Frederica von Stade in the Gloria's \\"Gratias agimus tibi\\" and Judith Blegen in the Credo's \\"Et incarnatus est\\". The chorus was no less impressive, if it could perhaps have sung even more lustily than it did. The New York Philharmonic, sometimes disappointing with other conductors, was on its best form for Bernstein. The recording quality was variable, but mostly satisfactory. \\"One hesitates to overwork such words as 'inspiration' and 'glory',\\" Freed concluded, \\"but these are the qualities that shine from every bar of this beautiful performance.\\"Freed, Richard: Stereo Review, September 1975, pp. 84‚Äì85 Roger Fiske reviewed the Harmoniemesse on LP in Gramophone in December 1975, comparing it with an Argo disc of the Mass conducted by George Guest and released in 1966.Haydn, Joseph: Mass No. 12, cond. George Guest, Argo LP, ZRG 515, 1966 Bernstein's soloists, he thought, sounded as though they were \\"behind the orchestra and in amongst the chorus\\", Guest's as though they were standing much closer. Bernstein's arrangement was possibly in accord with the custom of Haydn's own day, but seemed to deny his soloists as much scope for self-expression as had been enjoyed by Guest's. Bernstein's chorus itself was \\"of the highest class\\", as was his orchestra, which demonstrated its virtuosity by coping with the breakneck pace that he had adopted, perhaps unwisely, for the end of the \\"Agnus Dei\\". The audio quality of his disc was fairly good, even if his balance engineer had allowed his woodwinds to \\"occasionally sound unnaturally prominent\\". Bernstein's was \\"a strong, vivid performance\\", but, although there was little to choose between the two discs, Guest's was the better both technologically and musically.Fiske, Roger: Gramophone, December 1975, p. 1089 Vienna's Palais Schwarzenberg, where Die Sch√∂pfung was first performed in 1798 David S. Gutman reviewed Die Sch√∂pfung and the Harmoniemesse coupled on CD in Gramophone in May 1993. Bernstein's Die Sch√∂pfung, he thought, was among the conductor's better essays in Haydn. Yes, the solo singing was problematic, and Judith Raskin had been \\"much criticized for her inadequate German\\". Yes, Bernstein's tempi were sometimes unorthodox. And yes, some numbers were hammy. But \\"the basic impression made [was] brisk and taut\\". As for the Harmoniemesse, \\"featuring some big-name soloists\\", it was \\"exciting (if rough- and-ready)\\". The album as a whole was \\"well worth considering\\".Gutman, David S.: Gramophone, May 1993, pp. 56‚Äì59 Bergkirche ‚Äì also known as the Haydnkirche ‚Äì in Eisenstadt, Vienna, where the Harmoniemesse was first performed and where Haydn was entombed Geraint Lewis included the album in a survey of the Harmoniemesse discography in Gramophone in April 2014. He made little mention of the soloists, noting only a \\"richly operatic contribution from a youthful Frederica von Stade\\". He found Joseph Flummerfelt's Westminster Choir \\"painfully stretched\\", and thought that their \\"democratic choral-society gusto\\" was not ideally suited to music meticulously crafted for performance during a religious service. He was happier with the relish that the orchestra displayed while delivering \\"big-boned Haydn in every sense\\". He characterized Bernstein's conducting as \\"galvanizing\\". \\"He clearly enjoys the music unreservedly and propels it forward with insight and enthusiasm\\", he wrote. His final verdict was that \\"the essential greatness of the music is not seriously compromised on this recording.\\" Lewis, Geraint: Gramophone, April 2014, pp. 130‚Äì133 =Accolade= In the September 1975 issue of Stereo Review, Harmoniemesse was included in the magazine's list of the \\"Best Recordings of the Month\\".

In 1975, CBS released the Harmoniemesse as both a stereo LP (British catalogue number CBS 76410, American catalogue number M 33267) and a quadraphonic LP (American catalogue number MQ 33267). The four-channel release used Columbia's SQ stereo-quadraphonic matrix system. In 1992, CBS issued the two works together on CD (catalogue number SM2K 47560) as the thirty-sixth of the hundred recordings in their Leonard Bernstein \\"Royal Edition\\", so called because each album in the series was illustrated with a watercolour by Prince Charles. The album was also available in a 37-CD box set titled \\"The Royal Edition: Vol. 2\\" (catalogue number SX37K 48179). The album included a 92-page booklet which provided the text of the Harmoniemesse in English, French, German and Latin, and the text of Die Sch√∂pfung and notes by Andreas Kluge and Prince Charles in English, French, German and Italian. The booklet was illustrated with three of Prince Charles's paintings and five photographs of Bernstein.

It was published in the EU Official Journal on 23 December 2018. The regulation includes requirements to obtain consent from a counterparty before re-using its collateral, disclosure and reporting to trade repositories. The objective of the legislation is to reduce systemic risk in securities lending and get more visibility over collateral re-use.  Overview  The Securities Financing Transaction Regulation (SFTR) is a body of legislation for securities lending markets. SFTR was introduced by the EU to implement the FSB‚Äôs policy framework for addressing shadow banking risks in securities lending and repo and increase transparency in these markets.: The EU sought to increase the transparency of SFTs by requiring * all SFTs, except those concluded with central banks, to be reported to central databases known as trade repositories * information on the use of SFTs by investment funds to be disclosed to investors in the regular reports and pre-investment documents issued by the funds * minimum transparency conditions to be met when collateral is reused, such as disclosure of the risks and the obligation to acquire prior consent SFTR‚Äôs set of obligations were designed to take effect on a phased basis over a period of several years.  Key aspects  = Consent to re-use collateral = The Regulation seeks to improve the transparency of the reuse (any pre-default use of collateral by the collateral taker for their own purposes) of financial instruments by setting minimum conditions to be met by the parties involved, including written agreement and prior consent. Clients or counterparties have to give their consent before reuse can take place and that they make that decision based on clear information on the risks that it might entail. = Disclosure = Funds engaged in SFTs and total return swaps have a detailed reporting requirement on these operations, both in the regular reports of funds and in pre- investment documents. = Reporting = Any EU financial or non-financial entity will be required to report. This includes banks, brokers, funds, insurance companies, pension funds, other financing companies and non- financial companies. The European System of Central Banks, the Bank for International Settlements and public bodies managing public debt are exempted from reporting in order not to jeopardise their discretionary policies. To minimise the compliance burden for the industry, ESMA was asked to achieve consistency with the reporting already required under the European Markets Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) for derivatives. The reports shall contain the composition of the collateral used in a SFT, whether that collateral is available for re-use and has been re-used, or whether any haircuts have been applied to it. The rules are deployed in four phases: i) banks and broker- dealers (11 April 2020), ii) financial markets infrastructures (11 July 2020), iii) insurers and asset managers (11 October 2020) and iv) non-financial entities (11 January 2021). To support firms‚Äô implementation, ESMA produced draft guidelines, setting out guidance on how to fill the main field and including base scenarios. They cover seven aspects of the reporting requirements, including the number of reportable SFTs, how to link SFT collateral with SFT loans, or how to reconcile breaks or rejections between counterparties.

It was preceded by the 1985 election and followed by the 1993 election. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes at this election. Candidates Conservative and Labour candidates contested all seats. Following the break-up of the SDP-Liberal Alliance, most seats were contested by both the Social and Liberal Democrats and the continuing SDP. There were a smaller number of Plaid Cymru and Green Party candidates and a few Independents. Outcome Labour retained control with an increased majority, by capturing a number of Conservative seats. A few other seats also changed hands. The Social and Liberal Democrats held all their seats bar one, but polled poorly elsewhere. A by-election was held on the same day in the Vale of Glamorgan constituency. This resulted in a much higher turnout than usual for local elections in wards which lay within the constituency.

It usually has a heterosexual focus, and norms surrounding sexuality can differ between each national depending on levels of religiosity, conservatism, location as well as other factors although a common Somali culture exists. Committal =Calmasho= Calmasho is a more serious form of courtship and typically involves a view towards marriage. The calmasho process may place a greater level if encumbrance upon the male than the female due to the meher stipulation whereby money is exchanged from man to woman, whereby the woman can set any price; or for introverted men, the doonasho, soo doonis or geedh fadhiisi process, whereby a man is required to inquire about his courtee to her male relative, usually her father. A common tradition is for a senior elder from the groom's side to act on behalf of the groom. Once an agreement exists, another occasion is set for this to be formalised during the nikah procession wherein instead a \\"male guardian\\" or imam enacts the giving away of the bride. This is often followed by a process called sooriyo wherein cash is placed within a keffiyeh and then split in half to be shared among the bride and grooms elders (or other family). If the groom confirms his commitment, then the \\"male guardian\\" or imam confirms the marriage and the attendees are informed by the following mashxarad (ululation) that is enacted by the women, which is followed by congratulating. The final ceremony involves the aroos (wedding), which depending on the specific community, may occur during a later time of the day.Ismail, Abdirashid A. \\"‚ÄòThey All Encouraged Me to Do it, But After All, the Decision is Mine‚Äô.\\" (2018): 124-131. Terminology More liberal or non-religious Somalis may use terms such as \\"isku biir\\" or \\"isku biirasho\\", which mean \\"to connect\\" or \\"making connections\\" respectively. Such terminology is intentionally unpretentious and is used in order to reduce pressure and provides for a less formal atmosphere, as the terms aren't necessarily romance-oriented, and as such leave options open for a platonic, transcendent, vocational or intellectual relationship.Kirk, John William Carnegie. A Grammar of the Somali Language: With Examples in Prose and Verse, and an Account of the Yibir and Midgan Dialects. Cambridge University Press, 2010. More religious Somalis may inculcate religious terminology, such as hunna libaasullakum (Q2:187), or the Somalized equivalent weydaarsiga dharka, both roughly meaning exchanging clothes, which is Islamic terminology to describe forming an attachment to a spouse.Luffin, Xavier. \\"Sub-Saharan Africa.\\" The Oxford Handbook of Arab Novelistic Traditions (2017): 411. There are many terms for a pair of spouses, including labada isqaba, afoyaal or saygayaasha. A more flirty term of endearment is gacaliso meaning my beloved.Nakano, Akio. Basic vocabulary in standard Somali. Institute for the Study of Languages and Cultures of Asia and Africa, 1976. Those who view the Somali dating process as impersonal may refer to it as shucuur la'aan, roughly meaning stoic or unsentimental. An in-law is referred to as dumaashi, soddog or in second person, soddog-aydi (my in-law'). During a divorce, the utterance of furitaan (divorce) is uttered thrice.Hakulinen, Tuovi, et al. \\"Ilmaa noo dhalanaaya: Waa buug hage ah oo loogu talagalay daryeelka ilmaha dhalanaaya.\\" (2018). Platonic terms of endearment used between male and female associates may include words such as wehel (friend), jaale (comrade), jaar (neighbour) or lammaane (partner). A term of endearment between confidants includes huuno meaning dear.Issa-Salwe, A. Electronic communication and an Oral Culture: the Dynamics of Somali Websites and Mailing Lists. Diss. PhD Dissertation. Centre for Information Management. School of Computing and Technology: Thames Valley University, 2006 The term for marriage in Somali is guur which also means to travel. This is in reference to the traditional associated marital practise of aqal gal (literally room entrance), which in practise meant the couple moved into a house. However, some religiously observant Somalis may substitute for terms that eschew materialism and favor forbearing ordinances such as \\"marry the unmarried among you ... If they should be poor, Allah will enrich them from His bounty\\" (Q24:32), however, parents often insist on financial stability from male suitorsKearney, Aisha. Grassroots activists and movements against female genital mutilation and cutting bridged with political alliances: Agency power and the potential to bring about change. State University of New York at Albany, 2016.. A derogatory term for a person (usually a woman) who ostensibly has no prospects for marriage or is past the typical marrying age is guumeeys which in another sense means owl, and roughly translates to English as spinster or femcelhttps://books.google.com/books?id=XpdAzRYruCwC&pg;=PA186&lpg;=PA186&dq;=guumays+somali&source;=bl&ots;=B0fo2qiDt7&sig;=ACfU3U1PYL1v3cuKCzLWtMIt7CWpT3JzNA&hl;=en&sa;=X&redir;_esc=y#v=onepage&q;=guumays%20somali&f;=false. In the South West dialects, the words zawaj or aroos are used to describe a marriage.Lewis, Ian M. \\"The Gadabuursi Somali Script.\\" Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies 21.1 (1958): 134-156. Tradition There are various Somali-specific cultural practises which have varying degrees of currency among Somalis. These include masaafo, which is the Somali term for elopement. Masaafo is carried out for two very different reasons; the first may be in order for a woman to avoid an arranged marriage, a practise which some religious leaders have referred to as \\"religious syncretism\\" or \\"bid'ah\\" (religious innovation). The other motive for masaafo is that it is by its nature spontaneous, and as such exacerbates romanticism. Another Somali cultural practise pertaining to courtship is heerin, whereby a single woman enters a random village whereupon she informs a local about her lovelornness; thereby this local is required to gather male eligible bachelors in the village whereupon she chooses her spouse on the spot on the same day.Luling, Virginia, and Anita S. Adam. \\"Continuities and changes: marriage in southern Somalia and the diaspora.\\" (2015): 139-166. The colonial era scholar and administrator stated that Somali males are nonsentimental creatures, stating: > The Somali is not a sentimental creature and has not much more regard for a > woman, once safely married to her, than he has for his camel.Personal and > Historical Memoirs of an East Africa Administrator, Sir Geoffrey Francis > Archer - 1963, p. 89 The most common marital practises among Somalis which are universal among both southern maamuls (provinces) i.e. konfuur galbeed or Jubaland, or northern such as Puntland, include the following four stipulations: (a) markhaati (witnesses, usually relatives), (b) hadiyad (a gift), (c) ogolaanshada (consent), (d) warfaafin waqaf ah (public declaration).Lowe, Lucy. \\"Refusing cesarean sections to protect fertile futures: Somali refugees, motherhood, and precarious migration.\\" American Ethnologist 46.2 (2019): 190-201. =Baatilnimo= Baatilnimo is derivative of the Arabic word Baatil, used by some Somalis to describe controversial, or religiously void and incorrect practises. One such controversial practise is xeedho-fur, a custom which is more common in the north which includes xeedho-fur, a type of container (usually containing odkac) roped in an awkward manner which is then unroped by the groom's relative. Due to the more adversarial nature of some participants, especially when the grooms family fails to unrope, xeedho-fur can be seen as controversial or backwards. The most controversial Somali cultural practice pertaining to romantic coaxing is arguably dhabargaraac, a bridenapping practise which is similar to Ala kachuu in Kyrgyzstan.Shanneik, Yafa, and Marja Tiilikainen. \\"Sudanese and Somali Women in Ireland and in Finland: Material Religion and Culture in the Formation of Migrant Women‚Äôs Identities in the Diaspora.\\" Muslims at the Margins of Europe. Brill, 2019. 245-268. Views =Haasaawe= The terms shukaansi and haasaawe have overlapping meanings, and both refer to the initial courtship process. When haasaawe does not have a serious or committed end-goal in mind, it is sometimes viewed among Somalis as promiscuous, and as such, may not bw done openly. However, the Hantiwadaag (socialist) period of Somali history, from 1969 until 1991, had a more lax attitude towards dating, as the government had an averse perception of an overtly strenuous form of religiosity.Ackley, Caroline. Intimacy and morality in Hargeisa, Somaliland. Diss. UCL (University College London), 2018. Nonetheless, since the formation of various regional states, especially when at the helm of a comparatively progressive regional president, there has been an increasing predilection towards freemixing, which may be seen in city centers.Rawlence, Ben. City of thorns: Nine lives in the world's largest refugee camp. Picador, 2016. =Faasiqnimo= The term faasiqnimo is the uncountable noun form of the agent noun faasiq, which describes a corrupt or impious person, or a venial sinner. Each era has seen incremental changes in the Somali view of sexuality, from the pre-modern until well into the post- independence era wherein cross-clan relationships were encouraged to nurture tribal bond. In the contemporary era, the charge of faasiqnimo is sometimes levelled at those engaging in qabyaalad, i.e. mahrams refusing to officiate or arrange a marriage due to being from different clans or regional states.Chonka, Peter. \\"Cartoons in conflict: Amin Arts and transnational geopolitical imagination in the Somali-language public sphere.\\" Critical African Studies 9.3 (2017): 350-376. The rejections faced by suitors has at times has led to an increase in tensions, friction, antagonism and distrust between Somali clans.Barre, Ugaaso Hussein. Sexual and Gender Based Violence against Internally Displaced Women in the Camps of Mogadishu, Somalia. MS thesis. OsloMet-Oslo Metropolitan University, 2018. Besides clan frictions, such additional dating criteria and expansions of requirements for eligibility has been blamed for an increase an late marriages or life-long celibacy among Somalis, due to the narrowing of the dating pool.Liberatore, Giulia. \\"Imagining an ideal husband: Marriage as a site of aspiration among pious Somali women in London.\\" Anthropological Quarterly 89.3 (2016): 781-812. =Makrux and xeer= Makrux or makruh is a word used by some Somalis to describe an act whose legal or religious ruling is uncertain, but is nonetheless taboo, disapproved or detestable. Xeer on the other hand describes the traditional legal system of Somalia. Since xeer can be based on arbitrary traditional views some of which may date back to pre-Islamic proto-Somali systems such as Waaqism, ambivalent circumstances can often create friction between the two schools of thought. However, the subsequent collapse of legal services in the midst of the collapse of the Hantiwadaag government in 1991 made many in the country default to most prevalent and best-funded legal system at the time, which was the petro-dollar-funded Gulf Arabian form of Islam imported from the Gulf States, as xeer the traditional Somali system wasn't as prominent, nor was it funded. At least until the formation of the federal government, this resulted in a more conservative exterior outlook.Lydon, Ghislaine. \\"Inventions and Reinventions of Sharia in African History and the Recent Experiences of Nigeria, Somalia and Mali.\\" Ufahamu: A Journal of African Studies 40.1 (2018). =Ahlul hawa= The predominant religious strand in Somalia is Sunnism, which in many local paradigms or standards, is practised with the Shafi'i madhab. However many other denominations are practised too, including Ibadism, Shi'ism, Sufism, Salafism/Zahirism, non-denominational Islam, as well as a proportion of non- practising cultural Muslims. There is also a very small proportion of Somali Christians, Somali Waaqists and Somali deists. Nonetheless, there is a prevailing current in Somali society against promiscuity, due to both religious mores and due to the fact that offspring that may occur from such convenances leaves populations outside the Somali clan framework. The Islamic terminology that is sometimes inculcated into Somali society to defer such sentiments include ahlul-hawa, which literally means people of base desires, and usually implies a conceited combination of being both hedonistic and nihilistic.Roald, Anne Sofie. \\"Female Islamic Interpretations on the Air: Fatwas and Religious Guidance by Women Scholars on Arab Satellite Channels.\\" Media and Political Contestation in the Contemporary Arab World. Palgrave Macmillan, New York, 2016. 211-231. A religious trope deriving from 4802 of Al-Bukhaari which has permeated into Somali culture outlines four particularly desirable traits to seek in a partner, consisting of (a) wealth status, (b) kinship status, (c) degree of attractiveness or unattractiveness, (d) levels of religiosity; although the actual hadith prioritizes the last trait.Asamarai, Layla A., Kenneth B. Solberg, and Phyllis C. Solon. \\"The role of religiosity in Muslim spouse selection and its influence on marital satisfaction.\\" Journal of Muslim Mental Health 3.1 (2008): 37-52. Some Islamists have used the proclivity among Somalis against the ahlul-hawa archetype or benchmark to push for a puritanical form of Islamism in rural parts of the country. In rural areas of parts of South West State of Somalia, there has been activity by the group called al-Shabaab. Its predecessors have existed since the 1990s, however al-Shabaab itself has operated in the naughts decade and the 2010s. During its peak, it publicly carried out stonings of those in extramarital relationships.Marchal, Roland. \\"A tentative assessment of the Somali Harakat Al-Shabaab.\\" Journal of Eastern African Studies 3.3 (2009): 381-404.

History  The Ricciardi of Lucca had a long-term banking relationship with King Edward I of England between 1272 and 1307. Prior to 1272, the English kings had occasional dealings with Italian merchants, mainly in purchasing luxury goods for the household and arranging for balance transfers to Rome. The outbreak of war between England and France in 1294 led to a credit crunch in international money markets. When Edward sought financial support from the Ricciardi, they were unable to advance him any funds. In response, Edward seized the Ricciardi‚Äôs assets in England, effectively bankrupting them. The Ricciardi derived significant benefits from their connection to the English monarchy, such as using the King‚Äôs Exchequer Courts to pursue their debtors and special access to the English wool market. During the period where they were bankers to the English Crown, the Ricciardi were involved in around half of all the forward contracts with English wool- producers. Forward contract prices were calculated manually using techniques similar to those used in modern-day quantitative finance. When the relationship between the English Crown and Ricciardi broke, England was unable to raise finance in international money markets and had to impose heavy levels of domestic taxation. These tax demands had wide repercussions on the 13th century English economy and were one of the main causes of the constitutional crisis of 1297.

Essentially a fire lance on a frame, the 'multiple bullets magazine eruptor' shoots lead shots, which are loaded in a magazine and fed into the barrel when turned around on its axis. In the history of gunpowder there are a range of theories about the transmission of the knowledge of gunpowder and guns from China to the rest of the world. Theories of independent firearm invention Although the oldest extant guns appear in the Yuan dynasty, the historian Tonio Andrade notes that there is a surprising scarcity of reliable evidence of guns in Iran or Central Asia prior to the late 14th century. He argues that, in the Middle East, no guns are mentioned prior to the 1360s, while Russian records do not contain reliable mentions of firearms until 1382, after the gun's arrival in western Europe, despite their closer proximity and interactions with the Mongol empires. =European origin= Portrait identifying Schwarz as the \\"inventor of artillery\\" Although there is some evidence that points to the possible appearance of guns in Andalusia as early as the 1330s, Thomas T. Allsen says that \\"in the Latin West the first uncontestable evidence of firearms is from 1326, surprisingly somewhat earlier than in the lands that lie between China ... and western Europe. This has caused some doubt among historians on the gun transmission theory, and even whether or not there was a transmission at all. One dissident opinion comes from Stephen Morillo, Jeremy Black, and Paul Lococo's War in World History which argues that \\"the sources are not entirely clear about Chinese use of gunpowder in guns. There are references to bamboo and iron cannons, or perhaps proto-cannons, but these seem to have been small, unreliable, handheld weapons in this period. The Chinese do seem to have invented guns independently of the Europeans, at least in principle; but, in terms of effective cannon, the edge goes to Europe.\\" There was also a stream of thought in Europe that emerged as early as the 15th century that attributed the invention of both gunpowder and the gun to a certain Berthold Schwartz. However it's not exactly certain who Berthold was or if he ever existed as there are no contemporary records of him. Some consider him a mythical figure, used as a stand-in \\"for all the curious and ingenious experiments related to the new and dangerous mixture of saltpetre, sulfur (brimstone) and carbon.\\" William Camden declared in 1605: According to Henry Pratap Phillips, Berthold Schwartz was actually named Constantin Anchlitzen, and made gunpowder at Freiburg around the year 1330. However J.R. Partington believes Black Berthold is a purely legendary figure invented for the purpose of providing a German origin for gunpowder and cannon. Others have tried to extrapolate ancient mentions of producing thunder as proof of gunpowder, but invariably run into problems with dating, anachronisms, and interpolations, leading modern arms historians to conclude that true gunpowder was unknown in Europe before the 13th century. =Islamic origin= There is another independent invention theory supporting an Islamic origin of the gun, citing the Mamluk deployment of hand cannons in 1260 and a passage by Ibn Khaldun on the Marinid Siege of Sijilmassa in 1274: \\"[ The Sultan] installed siege engines ‚Ä¶ and gunpowder engines ‚Ä¶, which project small balls of iron. These balls are ejected from a chamber ‚Ä¶ placed in front of a kindling fire of gunpowder; this happens by a strange property which attributes all actions to the power of the Creator.\\" The passage, dated to 1382, and its interpretation has been rejected as anachronistic by most historians, who urge caution regarding claims of Islamic firearms use in the 1204‚Äì1324 period as late medieval Arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, as they did for an earlier incendiary, naphtha. Needham believes Ibn Khaldun was speaking of fire lances rather than hand cannon. Historian Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, based on his analysis of 14th-century Arabic manuscripts which he argues to be copies of earlier texts, claims that hand cannons were used at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. However Hassan's claims have been refuted by other historians such as David Ayalon, Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, Tonio Andrade, and Gabor √Ågoston. Khan argues that it was the Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and believes cannons only reached Mamluk Egypt in the 1370s. According to Needham, the term midfa, dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand- guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic world do not occur until 1365 Similarly, Andrade dates the textual appearance of cannon in middle eastern sources to the 1360s. Gabor √Ågoston and David Ayalon believe the Mamluks had certainly used siege cannon by the 1360s, but earlier uses of cannon in the Islamic World are vague with a possible appearance in the Emirate of Granada by the 1320s, however evidence is inconclusive. =Indian origin= The idea that ancient Hindus had knowledge of gunpowder traces back to two 18th century authors: N.B. Halhed and Q. Craufurd. Halhed's Persian translation of a Sanskrit digest of laws, Code of Gentoo Laws (1776), translates agni-astra as \\"firearms\\" or \\"fire-arrow discharged from bamboo,\\" and sataghni, which literally means \\"hundred-killer\\" as \\"cannon.\\" Craufurd's text published in 1790 thought the old Hindus used gunpowder but was doubtful of their use before Europeans. In 1848, Professor Wilson, Director of the Asiatic Society at Calcutta, wrote that Indians were well acquainted with gunpowder and that rockets were an Indian inventioin. According to H.M. Elliot's The History of India as Told by its own Historians (1875), saltpetre may have possibly been used in explosives mentioned in the Ramayana and Sri Bhagavat. In 1880, Gustav Oppert claimed that the oldest documents describing gunpowder were the Sanskrit texts Sukraniti and Nitiprakasika. The Sukraniti contains descriptions of firearms and a formula for agni-curna (fire-powder) or 'suvarcilavana' (well-shining salt) very similar to that mentioned the Wujing Zongyao: 5 parts saltpetre, 1 part sulphur, and 1 part charcoal. The two firearms mentioned in the Sukraniti are a musket and a cart-drawn gun. There are no definite dates for these works despite claims of their antiquity. Oppert uses archaeological evidence from the ancient temple carvings in India, where soldiers are depicted carrying or in some cases firing the firearms, as proof of ancient use of fireams. Most of these temples are not older than 500 years except Tirupallani temple. However he claims the use of firearms in Sukraniti as authentic and the use of firearms and gunpowder in India since the ancient Vedic period (1500‚Äì500 BC). The ingredients listed in Sukraniti as constituents for gunpowder such as realgar, opiment, lac, camphor, indigo, pine gum, megnetic oxide of iron, vermillion, graphite are used in the manufacture of incendiary weapons in Arthashastra and also appear in Chinese accounts. The Arthashastra lists recipes for explosive and inflammable powder called 'agnisamyogas' or 'agniyoga' which J.R. Partington notes are very similar to gunpowder recipes quoted in Chinese, Arabic and European texts. However they do not contain saltpetre. A. Kalyanamaran argues that sulphur was not needed to create gunpowder and nitre could be obtained from fermented dung mentioned in the ingredients. The Greek historian Philostratos cites a letter written by Alexander saying that the reason why the Greek army refrained from advancing from Hydaspis to Ganges was because of the frightful dangers it encountered when people of Oxydraces threw flaming thunderbolts from the top of their forts. H. Wilkinson, who also believes Greek Fire was first discovered by the Indians, considers this as the earliest evidence of gunpowder in the world. According to J. Backman, gunpowder was invented in India and brought to Europe by Muslims. A device in the Arthashastra called ulka is used as a shower of firebrand which makes a thunder sound (or noise of drumming) in the sky which according to the Arthashastra is used by astrologists to show it to the enemy subjects on the day of their birth star. Authors such as A 7th century Chinese text mentions that people in northwest India were familiar with saltpetre and used it to produce purple flames. Nitisara, variously dated between 4th century BC ‚Äì 6th century CE, is a treatise by a Buddhist scholar named Kamandaka mentions gunfiring (nalikadibhdi) and states that the bodyguards of the king should rouse him with gun-firing if he indulges in girls, drinks, bouts etc. The gun firing was probably shotless military pyrotechnic using tubular weapons (although Oppert states that another word 'Nadika is also used in one of the text's version and may well mean gongs). Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi mentions in a treaties dated 910 a material called 'Indian salt', which he describes as \\"black and friable, with very little glitter,\\" which has been interpreted as saltpetre by Berthelot but this is disputed by Joseph Needham. Accoding to Firishta, Mehmud Ghaznavi (r. 999‚Äì1030) employed 1,008 cannon (top) and muskets (tufang) during his battle of Peshawar with Kabul Shahi king Annandapal. In a text called Mujmalut Tawarikh dated to 1126 which was translated from Arabic which itself was based on an original Sanskrit work, some type of grenade shaped like a terracotta elephant with a fuse is mentioned which was placed in the army van and when the invading army drew near, it exploded and the flames destroyed great portion of that army. According to Henry Pratap Phillips, some content in the Sanskrit works resemble that found in the Wujing Zongyao and it is possible that it was borrowed from the latter. However he believes it is the opposite and the gunpowder formula in the Wujing Zongyao came from the Sukraniti. Phillips and Oppert both consider The Rajalakshminarayana Hradaya, which Oppert dates to a \\"very remote period,\\" as proof of ancient Indian knowledge of gunpowder since it mentions charcoal, sulphur, and other materials in the preparation of fire. The lack of saltpetre is explained by Phillips as a conscious omission for the sake of secrecy. J.R. Partington rejected Oppert's claims in his A History of Greek Fire and Gunpowder. Partington believes that the sataghni mentioned in Sanskrit text was an iron-mace rather than a cannon while Joseph Needham is of the opinion that its translation as cannon cannot be sustained. The word for cannon, nalika, does not appear in any Sanskrit dictionary, and the source of Sukratini is the mythical Usanas of Sukracharya. There is also no classical Sanskrit word for saltpetre while shoraka in late Sanskrit is derived from Persian. Rajendralala Mitra raised doubts about the age of another work by Usanas, Nitisara of Sukracharya, noting that it contains descriptions of firearms as they were a hundred years ago. In Partington's opinion the work is legendary. In 1902, P.C. Ray raised doubts about the authenticity of textual evidence supporting ancient Hindu knowledge of gunpowder. Ray pointed out that the gunpowder mixture of 4:1:1 saltpetre, charcoal, and sulphur found in Sukraniti was the most efficient for guns and was not known in Europe until the 16th century, leading him to believe that the content was an interpolation by \\"the handiwork of some charlatan.\\" P.K. Gode provided textual evidence that pyrotechnical recipes recorded in the Sanskrit treatise, Kautukacintamani, were copied from a Chinese source. Some scholars based on the fact that it mentions matchlock firearms date the text to the modern period. Similarly H.L. Blackmore wrote in 1965 that Oppert's theories were absurd and no proper attempt to date the sources had been made. H.W.L. Hime goes as far as to say that \\"early Indian gunpowder is definitely a fiction\\" while Partington calls it a \\"legend.\\" According to Kaushik Roy, the ancient and medieval Indians used saltpetre for incendiary devices but not for gunpowder. Arguments for and against transmission An illustration of a 'flying-cloud thunderclap- eruptor,' a cannon firing thunderclap bombs, from the Huolongjing. A 'poison fog divine smoke eruptor' (du wu shen yan pao) as depicted in the Huolongjing. Small shells emitting poisonous smoke are fired. Historian Tonio Andrade supports the gun transmission theory, noting that while records of gunpowder weapons and their evolution into the gun exist in China, \\"there are no records of any such developments in Europe,\\" and that the arrival of the gun in Europe was such that it \\"appears fully formed around 1326.\\" This is not strictly true, as Kelly DeVries points out that compilers of early gunpowder recipes in Europe understood that should the instrument carrying gunpowder be enclosed on one end, the gunpowder reaction inside would produce \\"flying fire.\\" Andrade goes on to analyze the nature and etymology of gunpowder in Europe and comes to the conclusion that it is intrinsically in favor of the transmission theory rather than an independent invention. There are the older and more numerous formulas of gunpowder using a variety of different proportions of key ingredients ‚Äì saltpeter, sulphur, and charcoal ‚Äì which he believes is proof of its evolution and experimentation in China, where gunpowder was first applied to warfare as an incendiary, then explosive, and finally as a propellant. In contrast gunpowder formulas in Europe appear both later and offer very little divergence from the already ideal proportions for the purpose of creating an explosive and propellant powder. Another facet of the gunpowder transmission theory is the appearance of gunpowder in Europe ready made for military usage, and is generally referred to as gunpowder rather than a civilian term such as the Chinese \\"fire-drug,\\" which suggests an originally non-military usage, whereas in Europe it was almost immediately and exclusively used for its military qualities. Muslim terms of saltpeter may also point toward a gunpowder transmission, if not the gun itself, as an Andalusian botanist referred to it as \\"Chinese snow,\\" while in Persia it was called \\"Chinese salt.\\" Perhaps even further in the Sinocentric gun transmission camp is Joseph Needham who claims that \\"all the long preparations and tentative experiments were made in China, and everything came to Islam and the West fully fledged, whether it was the fire-lance or the explosive bomb, the rocket or the metal- barrel hand-gun and bombard.\\" However, theories of European, Islamic, and Indian origins for the gun and gunpowder still persist today in tandem with the transmission theory. There are problems on both extremes of the gun transmission debate. Its proponents emphasize the older history of gunpowder evolution as attested by historical records and archaeological samples in China, its less obviously militarily focused name as \\"fire medicine,\\" the Mongol role as a catalyst in disseminating gunpowder technology, and criticizes the scant or absent evidence of prior experimentation with gunpowder in Europe for non-military purposes before the arrival of the gun. However, there are still several blanks in the history of a gun transmission theory and the questions they raise which its proponents have been unable to answer. The rapid spread of guns across Eurasia, only 50 years from China to Europe, with non-existent evidence of its route from one extreme of the continent to the other, remains a mystery. Other Chinese inventions such as the compass, paper, and printing took centuries to reach Europe, with events such as the Battle of Talas as perhaps a possible takeoff point for discussion. No such event exists on record for either gunpowder or the gun. There is simply no clear route of transmission, and while the Mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, Timothy May points out that \\"there is no concrete evidence that the Mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of China.\\" According to Kate Raphael, the list of Chinese specialists recruited by Genghis Khan and Hulagu provided by the History of Yuan includes only carpenters and blacksmiths, but no gunpowder workers. A conclusion most military historians in the transmission camp have come to is that the rapid diffusion of gunpowder and the gun is probably best explained by its clear military applications. Opponents of the transmission theory criticize the vagueness of Chinese records on the specific usage of gunpowder in weaponry, the existence of gunpowder or possibly lack thereof in incendiary weapons as described by Chinese documents, the weakness of Chinese firearms, the non-existent route of diffusion or evidence of guns between Europe and China before 1326, and emphasize the independent evolution of superior guns in Europe. This too becomes problematic as already discussed above. Notably there is an acute dearth of any significant evidence of evolution or experimentation with gunpowder or gunpowder weapons leading up to the gun in 1326, which can be found in China. Gunpowder appeared in Europe primed for military usage as an explosive and propellant, bypassing a process which took centuries of Chinese experimentation with gunpowder weaponry to reach, making a nearly instantaneous and seamless transition into gun warfare, as its name suggests. Furthermore, early European gunpowder recipes shared identical defects with Chinese recipes such as the inclusion of the poisons sal ammoniac and arsenic, which provide no benefit to gunpowder. Bert S. Hall explains this phenomenon in his Weapons and Warfare in Renaissance Europe: Gunpowder, Technology, and Tactics by drawing upon the gunpowder transmission theory, explaining that \\"gunpowder came [to Europe], not as an ancient mystery, but as a well- developed modern technology, in a manner very much like twentieth-century 'technology-transfer' projects.\\" In a similar vein Peter Lorge supposes that the Europeans experienced gunpowder \\"free from preconceived notions of what could be done,\\" in contrast to China, \\"where a wide range of formulas and a broad variety of weapons demonstrated the full range of possibilities and limitations of the technologies involved.\\" There is also the vestige of Chinese influence, and not European, on Muslim terminology of some gunpowder related items such as saltpeter, which has been described as either Chinese snow or salt, fireworks which were called Chinese flowers, and rockets which were called Chinese arrows. Moreover, Europeans in particular experienced great difficulty in obtaining saltpeter, a primary ingredient of gunpowder which was relatively scarce in Europe compared to China, and had to be obtained from \\"distant lands or extracted at high cost from soil rich in dung and urine.\\" Thomas Arnold believes that the similarities between early European cannons and contemporary Chinese models suggests a direct transmission of cannon making knowledge from China rather than a home grown development. Whatever the truth may be, the first unambiguous references to guns appeared in Europe in the 1320s. References Bibliography * .  * . . * .   .

He is best known for his work in the mystery, suspense and occult fields.  Personal life  Hallahan was born on December 12, 1925 in Brooklyn, New York, to William H. Hallahan, Jr., and Berenice E. Lyons, the third child in a family of six boys and one girl. He served in the US Navy in World War II as a radioman second class in Natal, Brazil. He attended Temple University on the GI Bill, and graduated with a B.S. in Journalism and an M.A. in English. Hallahan had a writing career that spanned seven decades. His first job was with Temple University, as a college English instructor, but he soon left to start his business career as a writer and editor of the Boot and Shoe Recorder at Chilton Publications. In 1957, he entered the advertising world as a copywriter for M. Russell Berger, a small Philadelphia advertising agency. After a brief stint there, he joined the international ad agency N.W. Ayer, then headquartered in Philadelphia, as copy chief, where he worked on accounts such as United Airlines, the Plymouth Division of Chrysler and other similar clients. In 1968, Hallahan was sent to the Detroit offices of N.W. Ayer as part of a team to try to save the Plymouth account from leaving N.W. Ayer. The account nonetheless left, and Hallahan joined an ad agency that became Garceau, Hallahan and McCollough. At the same time, he also began to conduct a mail-order copy writing course. Hallahan began to turn his focus on writing a novel. In early 1971 his wife Marion sent his first novel The Dead of Winter to a literary agent; the book was published in 1972.  Writing career  Hallahan published over twelve books in the mystery, occult and non-fiction genres. His first novel, The Dead of Winter, was nominated by the Mystery Writers of America for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best First Mystery, and his fourth novel, Catch Me: Kill Me, was nominated and won the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel in 1978. His third novel, The Search for Joseph Tully, was a New York Times Bestseller and hailed as one of the most frightening books of all time. For the book opening, mock gravestones that read ‚ÄúHere Lies Joseph Tully‚Äù were lined up and down Park Avenue in New York. His series character Charlie Brewer, the fallen but philosophical CIA spy, first appeared in the Edgar award-winning Catch Me: Kill Me, and continued as the protagonist in The Trade, Foxcatcher and Tripletrap.

The human immune system is generally able to recognize and fight cancer cells. However, this ability is usually insufficient and the cancer continues to spread. Cancer immunotherapy is based on harnessing and potentiating the ability of the immune system to fight cancer. Each tumor has its own individual genetic fingerprint, the mutanome, that includes numerous genetic alterations. As opposed to a preformed drug, individualized cancer vaccination is a therapy that targets specific cancer mutations of the individual patient\`s tumor. The production of vaccines tailored to match a person's individual constellation of cancer mutations has become a new field of research. The concept of individualized cancer immunotherapy aims to identify individual mutations in the tumor of a patient, that are crucial for the proliferation, survival or metastasis of tumor cells. For this purpose, the individual genetic blueprint of the tumor is decrypted by sequencing and, using this blueprint as a template, a synthetic vaccine tailored to the tumor of the individual patient is prepared. This vaccine is designed to control and train the body's immune system to fight the cancer.  Background  Cancer is characterized by an accumulation of genetic alterations. A tumor may acquire up to thousands of different somatic mutations during the process of initiation and progression. A smaller number of cancer mutations interfere with normal cell regulation and help to drive cancer growth. Somatic mutations in the tumor genome can cause tumors to express mutant proteins (neoantigens) that are recognized by autologous T cells as foreign and constitute cancer vaccine targets. Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB, the number of mutations within a targeted genetic region in the cancerous cell's DNA) have been thus suggested to correlate with patient survival post immunotherapy, although the findings are disputed. Such neoantigens are specifically expressed by tumor tissue and are not found on the surface of normal cells. They can upregulate tumor-specific T cells in patients without killing normal cells. T cells are key effectors of anticancer immunity. They are capable of distinguishing tumor cells from normal ones by recognizing HLA-bound cancer-specific peptides. A requirement for the recognition of neoantigens by the immune system is that the neoantigens and their antigenic determinants, the neoepitopes, are processed and presented by human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules. These molecules may be recognized by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes as foreign neoepitopes and, with the help of CD4+ T lymphocytes, trigger an immune response leading to tumor-specific killing. CD8+ T cells are specialized for direct tumor cell killing. CD4+ T cells can interact with antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells to recruit other immune cells or stimulate effector cells. Most cancer neoantigens in humans arise from unique mutations. A patient‚Äôs cancer is intra- as well as interlesionally heterogeneous and changes its composition over time. Each patient has an individual mutational signature (mutanome), and only a very small portion of the mutations are shared between patients. A concept is therefore that an immunotherapy directed at neoantigens needs to be individualized. The development of sequencing technology has improved the accuracy of identification and localization of neoantigens. With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), it has become possible to systematically predict cancer neoantigens for individual patients.  Preclinical research  In animal models, several independent studies have shown that vaccines consisting of computationally predicted neoepitopes mediated anti-tumor activity in mice.  First-in-human clinical trials  The translation of individualized neoepitope vaccines into clinical oncology is under investigation. Formats under consideration for individualized vaccines are synthetic peptides, messenger RNA, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, engineered bacteria, and antigen-loaded dendritic cells. = Patients with melanoma = In 2015, a first step towards individualized neoantigen vaccination was achieved by treating three melanoma patients with autologous dendritic cells loaded with a personalized mixture of seven peptides (neoantigens) that were predicted to bind to human leukocyte antigens (HLA). The neoantigen-loaded dendritic cells were cultured in vitro for autologous transfusion. Results showed that the vaccine enhanced the existing immune response and elicited a neoantigen-specific T cell response that was not detected prior to injection. Sahin et al. were the first to identify suitable neoantigens using next generation sequencing (NGS) and used them to produce customized RNA vaccines capable of encoding these neoantigens. A total of 13 patients with melanoma received the RNA vaccine, eight of which had no tumor development during the follow-up. Immune surveillance analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in patients demonstrated that the RNA vaccines expanded preexisting T cells and induced de novo T cell responses against neoepitopes not recognized prior to vaccination. Another study group (Ott et al.) identified neoantigens in six melanoma patients and used them to create a customized vaccine for each patient with long peptides representing up to 20 mutations per patient. After surgical resection of the tumor, the vaccine was injected. The results showed that the tumor did not reappear in four patients during an observation period of 32 months after vaccination. = Patients with glioblastoma = Hilf et al. administered individualized neoantigen vaccines to 15 patients with glioblastoma. The vaccine triggered T cell immune responses to the predicted neoantigens. Keskin et al. investigated individualized neoantigen vaccines in eight glioblastoma patients after surgical resection and conventional radiotherapy. The study group observed that the vaccine increased the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells that migrated from the peripheral blood into the brain.  Manufacturing process of mutation-based vaccines  Individualized cancer vaccines typically consist of multiple predicted neoepitopes. The manufacturing process involves several steps. Tumor biopsies and healthy tissue (eg, peripheral blood cells) of a patient diagnosed with cancer are examined by NGS. Tumor-specific mutations in protein-coding genes are then identified by comparison of sequences from tumor and normal DNA. Computational tools classify these mutations for the highest likelihood of immunogenicity, that is, for the predicted expression and binding affinity of neoepitopes on HLA molecules. The top rankers are then used for the production of the vaccine. The intended output is an on-demand vaccine with a unique composition tailored to the patient's individual cancer mutanome.  Individualized NeoAntigen Specific Immunotherapy (iNeST)  The research approach to mobilize an immune response tailored to the individual tumor of a patient is also referred to as individualized neoantigen-specific immunotherapy (iNeST). iNeST is based on the specific tumor mutations (neoantigens) of a single patient, with the aim of triggering high-affinity immune responses of T cells to the individual patient-specific cancer. The development of iNeST is driven by biotech companies  References  Category:Medical genetics Category:Biotechnology Category:Applied genetics Category:Genomics Category:Vaccines Category:Cancer vaccines ","title":"Individualized cancer immunotherapy"},{"id":"61793237","text":"The United Kingdom originally planned to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest 2020.

It is still owned by the descendants of Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, chief minister under Queen Anne and is a Grade II* listed building. The house was built around 1660 by Edward Harley to replace Brampton Bryan Castle, which had been destroyed during the Civil War. It was constructed in three storeys of brick and sandstone, with a Welsh slate roof and enhanced and enlarged in the 18th century. History The Brampton Bryan estate had been owned by the Harley family since 1309, when Sir Robert Harley married Margaret de Brampton. It contained a deer park and is today Grade II listed in its own right. The family lived in the Brampton Bryan Castle until its slighting in 1644 by Parliamentarian forces during the ownership of Robert Harley, for which he later received significant financial compensation. His son Edward built the new house after the Restoration of the Monarchy. The new house passed down in 1700 to Edward Harley's son Robert, who became the first Earl of Oxford in 1711 and then to his son Edward, the 2nd Earl, who however preferred to live at Wimpole Hall in Cambridgeshire which his wife had inherited. Brampton Bryan Hall nevertheless remained in the ownership of the Harley family, passing in 1741 to the 2nd Earl's cousin, Edward, the 3rd Earl. It then descended in turn to Edward, the 4th Earl, who died in the house in 1790, Edward, the 5th Earl, who also died there in 1848 and Edward, the 6th and last Earl. After that the estate passed in 1853 to a distant relative William Daker Harley. The house would then be sometimes leased out; in the 1870s it was occupied by General George Staunton and family. The house is now the private home of Edward and Victoria Harley. The house has been used as a film location, particularly as Henry Wilcox's country mansion in the Howard's End film.

In her work, Coit has produced numerous series across media, including sprayed-oil paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, installation, video projection, writing, performance, steel, neon, and shadow. Her work is in the collections of the State of New Mexico, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles, and the Museum of Fine Arts in Santa Fe.  Early Life and Education  Coit graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1968 with a Bachelor of Fine Arts. In 1971, she moved from Boston, Massachusetts to California to begin graduate coursework at CalArts Design School and to pursue her creative work.  Artwork  Coit works simultaneously in different media: drawing with graphite, engineered paper, reworked found objects, shadows, steel, neon, installation, performance and video. She explores physical and emotional perception, and the way understanding or feelings appear to be and then change. Through the different media she uses, there is continuity in aesthetic and intention. Coit has a history of working with language and signage, with many of her works taking the form of poetic messages. Two recurring themes are often in her works ‚Äì One is the mystery of interface, the edge or the space that separates one thing or place from another, defining both sides. The other concept is that of pentimento, a painting term about transparency, layering, and visual seepage. The resulting work is created through a process layered, aggregated, and deconstructed materials to form a whole, which are then erased, built upon, torn down, and reconstructed. = Exhibitions = Coit began exhibiting in the greater Los Angeles area in 1978. Her work has since been exhibited nationally at the Los Angeles County Museum, the Hammer Museum, the San Antonio Art Institute, The Whitney Center for the Arts, and the Anchorage Museum of Art. In New Mexico, she has shown work in Santa Fe at the New Mexico Museum of Art, the Center for Contemporary Arts, SITE Santa Fe, AXLE Contemporary, Gerald Peters Gallery, and the now-closed Evo Gallery and James Kelly Contemporary. = Awards/Honors = In 2006, Madelin received a grant from Creative Capital for professional development, and participated in a resulting exhibition at 516 ARTS in 2007. Madelin has also been the recipient of artist residencies at Ucross, Jentel, Playa, and Hambidge. She currently sits on the board at SITE Santa Fe.

Elections are postponed. Governments rush to find funding to combat the virus, provide medical supplies and services, and to mitigate the economic slowdown.

The epicenter of the pandemic shifted from East Asia at the beginning of the year to Europe in March and April, then to the United States and Latin America in May and June. As of June 7, there have been over 7,000,000 confirmed cases and 400,000 deaths worldwide, with about 30% of the cases in the United States.

He was the top-rated European two-year-old of 2019 when he was unbeaten in six races including the Woodcote Stakes, Chesham Stakes, Vintage Stakes, National Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he won the Prix Jean Prat and was placed in the 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Prix du Moulin. Background Pinatubo is a bay colt bred in Ireland by Godolphin in whose blue colours he races. The colt was sent into training with Charlie Appleby at Godolphin's European base at Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the eleventh crop of foals sired by Shamardal whose wins included the Dewhurst Stakes, Poule d'Essai des Poulains, Prix du Jockey Club and St. James's Palace Stakes. His other offspring have included Able Friend, Mukhadram, Lope de Vega and Blue Point. Pinatubo's dam Lava Flow was a successful racemare who won two races including the Listed Prix de la Seine at Longchamp Racecourse in 2013. Her granddam El Jazirah was a full-sister to Rafha. Racing career =2019: two-year-old season= Pinatubo began his career in an evening novice race at Wolverhampton on 10 May 2019, beating another Godolphin horse, Platinum Star by 3 1/4 lengths. This was followed by a win in the formerly Listed Woodcote Stakes on Oaks day at Epsom. On 22 Jun 2019, Pinatubo was the 3/1 second favourite for the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot but in the event, beat the favourite, the Aidan O'Brien trained Lope y Fernandez (Round Tower Stakes) by 3 1/4 lengths, breaking the course record in the process. The horse then took a step up to win his first Group race, the Group 2 Vintage Stakes at the Glorious Goodwood meeting by 5 lengths on 30 July. For his first Group 1 race, the Vincent O'Brien National Stakes at The Curragh, he was ridden for the first time by William Buick, who had missed 12 weeks of the season following concussion. Pinatubo was made 1/3 favourite and won by 9 lengths from Armory (Futurity Stakes), with the Racing Post referring to him as a \\"Ferrari of a racehorse\\" and trainer Appleby stating \\"he's the best two-year-old I've ever trained\\". Comparisons were drawn with two year old performances from horses like Frankel and Arazi. Following this victory, form analysts Timeform rated him the second best two-year-old of the modern era behind Celtic Swing On 12 October, Pinatubo ended his season in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket and started the 1/3 favourite. His eight opponents included Wichita (winner of the Somerville Tattersall Stakes), Positive (Solario Stakes), Arizona (Coventry Stakes) and Mystery Power (Superlative Stakes). After racing in mid-division he overtook the front-running Arizona in the final furlong to win by two lengths. In the official ratings for the 2019 season Pinatubo was rated 128, the highest two-year-old rating awarded since Celtic Swing was rated 130 in 1994. =2020: three-year-old season= The flat racing season in England was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the 2000 Guineas was run a month later than usual on 6 June over the Rowley mile at Newmarket. Pinatubo started the 5/6 favourite against fourteen opponents but finished third behind Kameko and Wichita. Two weeks later the colt started favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot. After racing towards the rear of the field he took the lead approaching the final furlong but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a length into second place by Palace Pier. On 12 July Pinatubo was sent to France and started the 3/5 favourite for the Group 1 Prix Jean Prat, run over 1400 metres at Deauville Racecourse. His ten opponents included Alson, Tropbeau (Prix du Calvados), Molatham (Jersey Stakes), Arizona, Wooded (Prix Texanita) and Kenway (Prix La Rochette). Ridden by Buick, he was restrained towards the rear of the field before moving up to take the lead 200 metres from the finish and kept on well under pressure to win by three quarters of a length from the 40/1 outsider Lope Y Fernandez. Buick commented \\"He felt really good today. He showed his brilliance, he showed how fast he is, and I think coming back to seven furlongs was a little bit easier for him... At Ascot, he did absolutely nothing wrong and he was just outstayed by a horse who was on the improve and was stronger at that trip on that day. But I think he showed his resilience and constitution to come out of that race and do what he did here\\". Pinatubo returned to France for the Prix du Moulin over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 12 September, in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. Ridden by Doyle, he went off the 1.4/1 favourite and after racing in fourth place he finished strongly to take second place behind the four-year-old Persian King. On 9 October it was announced that Pinatubo had been retired from racing and would begin his career as a breeding stallion at the Dalham Hall Stud.

Members included John Joseph Willson, his sister Hannah Willson, his wife Emilie Dorothy Hilliard, and their four children, Michael Anthony Hilliard Willson, twins Margaret Willson and E. Dorothy Willson, and Mary Hilliard Willson. John Joseph, known as J.J. Willson, was senior partner in the firm of Willson, Walker & Co. which owned the Sheepscar tannery, at one time the largest in the country. He was instrumental to the movement for the foundation of Leeds Art Gallery, working on a committee alongside John Atkinson Grimshaw and others, and he was a vice president of the Yorkshire Union of Artists when John William Waterhouse was president. J.J., Margaret and Dorothy exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition; on five occasions in Margaret's case. Michael and Mary achieved commissions including caricatures of prominent Leeds public figures such as Sir James Kitson and John Barran MP, and portraits in oils of Isaac and Ann Rickett and George Corson. The children and sister of J.J. never married. Group setup and background =Family origins= The Willson family owned High Wray House, at High Wray, Claife, Ambleside, now a listed building. It was built in 1728 by Anthony Wilson and his wife Dorothy. They \\"owned and farmed much of the land across the Hawkshead, Coniston and Langdale valleys,\\" extending and refurbishing an upper storey to the house in the nineteenth century. In the early 1840s the family funded a schoolhouse in the grounds of High Wray House; the original schoolhouse was demolished, and the replacement school building later became High Wray Village Hall. =Willson, Walker & Co.= Former Willson, Walker & Co. building, Sheepscar The Willson Group consisted of a set of close relatives whose work was funded by their family firm Willson, Walker & Co. in Leeds, due to the financial success of John Willson Senior, JP, (b. Claife or Hawkshead ) who lived at Old Hall, Barwick- in-Elmet and Roundhay, Leeds, in 1861,1861 Census John Wilson Old Hall Roundhay 3357/83 p18 and 1 West Hill, Potternewton, Headingley in 1871. His wife was Margaret (b. Kendal ).1871 Census John Wilson Chapeltown 4576/45 p5 John Wilson (sic) was mayor of Leeds between 9 November 1853 and 9 November 1854. John Senior established the family tannery business of Willson, Walker & Co. Ltd. in 1823; it moved to Sheepscar Street, Sheepscar, in 1847.The Engineer of 15 August 1876 p180 The firm manufactured Spanish leather and leather glue, and made leather artefacts too, for example a leather dressing case, possibly made for the Great Exhibition of 1851. By 1893 it had become the largest tannery in the country. It collapsed in 1901, however it is reasonable to suppose that it was the income from J.J. Willson's senior directorship of this firm which permitted his family's dedication to art until around 1900. The factory was purchased in 1904 by Charles F. Stead & Co., a company which as of 2019 still produced leather goods there. =Studio locations= Ballamona, where the Willson Group lived and worked to at least 1902 All members of this group worked from home. The Willson Group consisted of J.J. Willson's household: himself, his wife, his son and three daughters, and J.J.'s unmarried sister Hannah. They lived together in various locations in the Leeds area. From to 1871 they were living in Newton Grove, Chapeltown Road, Headingley, Potternewton.1871 England Census 4541/165 p.50 From at least 1888 to 1891 they lived with a number of servants at 2 Moorland Terrace, off Reservoir Road in the Lawnswood area of Leeds. From at least 1897 to 1902 the family were at a house called Ballamona, Otley Road, Headingley, Leeds; it was rented from architect George Corson.1901 England Census 4246/31 p.13 By 1906 until at least 1911 the four children, still unmarried, were living at 5 Moorland Road, Leeds with their aunt Hannah Willson.1911 England Census 500/54/27035 Hannah Willson Hannah Willson (Leeds ‚Äì Leeds 7 July 1918) Deaths Sep 1918 Willson Hannah 89 Leeds 9b 485.

He was also an amateur artist, \\"quite a brilliant painter in watercolours,\\" specialising in sporting and landscape subjects. Artists Edwin Moore and Richard Waller gave him some lessons, but he was mainly self-taught. He exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts and the Walker Art Gallery, and in 1896 he became a vice-president of the Yorkshire Union of Artists, with John William Waterhouse R.A. as president. He was \\"one of the judges selected for adjudication of prizes at the Leeds School of Art, as well as that at York.\\" He also donated prizes for art to the Yorkshire Union of Mechancs' Institutes in 1889. He was a longstanding member of Leeds Philosophical Society council, and one of the governors of Yorkshire College. Although he declined public work during his final six years, he \\"painted up to the last.\\" Ultimately the family firm failed, J.J. fell ill with dropsy and \\"graver symptoms,\\" and died at his sister's house at High Wray, Ambleside on 15 November 1903, aged 67 years. The cause of death was recorded as fibroid degeneration of the heart, and dropsy. The gross value of his estate was ¬£6,240, and his Will was proved at Wakefield on 31 December 1903. =Leeds Fine Art Society Executive Committee= Athenaeum Building, location of Yorkshire Fine Art Exhibitions from 1880 John Joseph was the \\"originator of the modern picture exhibitions in [Leeds].\\" He was one of the founding members, and for 27 years the president, of the Leeds Fine Art Society (LFAS), and honorary secretary of the Yorkshire Fine Art Exhibition (YFAE). > \\"As president of the Leeds Fine Arts Club, John Joseph Willson's artistic > and social qualities were seen to the fullest advantage. It is a small > society which makes no pretence to an artistic mission, but does something > for the mutual encouragment of its members not only to practise, but still > more to appreciate, art. How much it owes to its first and only president it > will realise ... he was, by the example of his work and by his cheery > enthusiasm, the life and soul of the little body.\\" (Written after his death > by the Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer) The LFAS was an organisation which in 1876 formed an Executive Committee, including Hon. Sec. J.J. Willson, dedicated to raising funds for, and founding, the building of a permanent public fine art gallery. Although the committee members changed over time, and the building and funding process was ultimately taken over by Leeds Town Hall, it can be said that the original committee initiated the movement to found the gallery, and arranged much of the early funding by subscription. Several of the original committee members, including J.J. Willson, took part in the process to the last. The committee first met at the Mechanics' Institute. The original committee membership included the Marquis of Ripon as president, Rev. John Gott (vicar of Leeds, and son of Benjamin Gott) John Atkinson Grimshaw, several Leeds aldermen from Leeds Town Hall, and architect W.H. Thorp who would ultimately design its planned Municipal Art Gallery in 1886‚Äì1888. North Room of Leeds Art Gallery, 1888 By 1879 J.W. Davis was Hon. Sec. and the committee was meeting at the Mayor's rooms in Leeds Town Hall. The committee, which had always included Town Hall representatives, had grown to include more town councillors, J.J. Willson, and various artists. At this point the committee had estimated the final cost at ¬£10,000, had raised ¬£2,000 by subscription; of the remainder one third was \\"guaranteed in Leeds,\\" and the rest \\"guaranteed at Huddersfield and Halifax.\\" By 1880, one of the secretaries of the committee, J.W. Davis, was saying, \\"We may hope that our success ... may ultimately ultimately encourage the authorities of the town to take the matter in hand, and add another institution of beneficence and culture to those already existing in Leeds, in the shape of a permanent and public fine art gallery.\\" By 1888, Leeds Town Hall had indeed taken the matter in hand, taken much of the credit for the idea, and arranged funds to complete the cost of building, and for maintenance of the gallery. The Marquis of Ripon and W.H. Thorp, who were on the original committee, were present at the opening of the gallery in 1888. Meanwhile, from 1880 the YFAE held a five-year lease for exhibitions in the Athenaeum Building, Park Lane (now The Headrow), Leeds. J.J. contributed works to the YFAE's first Spring Exhibition in 1880, alongside work by Thomas Sidney Cooper, John Atkinson Grimshaw, Edwin Landseer, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, William Calder Marshall, and others. J.J. used his position to promote the idea of a new \\"good gallery\\" for Leeds. He said that, \\"ever since he had been able to distinguish between a tea tray and an all-right picture, he had been desirous of seeing his native town in possession of a good gallery\\" for the display of the Committee's existing collection, and for the promotion and sale of the work of local artists, because \\"artists must live.\\" =Amateur dramatics= At one time, John Joseph was involved with amateur dramatics. For example, on 27 and 28 February 1889, in support of a charity, he took part in The Parvenu by G.W. Godfrey, and Chalk and Cheese by Eille Norwood at the Assembly Rooms in Briggate, Leeds. Of his part in The Parvenu, the York Herald said, \\"Mr J.J. Willson gave a capital rendering of the part of the impecunious baronet Sir Fulke Pettigrew, acting with care and discretion.\\" J.J. \\"was capital as Marmaduke Vavasour\\" in New Men and Old Acres in a charity performance with a Leeds amateur troupe at the Albert Hall, Cookridge Street, Leeds, on Friday 12 December 1890. =Exhibitions= * Autumn tints in Lundoleu, Norway (1880), \\"The absence of ... breadth is apparent in Autumn tints in Lundoleu, Norway ... where the excellent work in the grey and purple stones which break the foreground and in the distant mountains is not supported by the treatment of the trees in the middle distance,\\" Yorkshire Art Exhibition. * Anxious Moments (1880), \\"a stormy effect is realised by considerable power,\\" Yorkshire Art Exhibition. * The Breezy Expanse of Adel Moor (1885), \\"most important and gratifying,\\" Yorkshire Artists' Exhibition. * Unknown work (1886), Yorkshire Artists' Exhibition. * A Study of Gossamer (11 February 1890), conversazione at the Philosophical Hall, Park Row, Leeds.

In his later years, indeed, he had done more than > dabble, for he devoted to his water-colour work all the time which a > business man could spare from his daily toil, working frequently, if not > chiefly, by artificial light - a condition anything but favourable for > appreciating the niceties of colouring, and sufficiently accounting for what > was perhaps the least satisfactory aspect of his art. Perhaps its most > admirable feature was its steady progress. Up to the very last years, when > ill-health began to undermine his natural vigour, he was always advancing > ... The facility in handling he attained was certainly remarkable, and on > this account alone his happiest efforts in landscape-work were capable of > holding their own in any of the exhibitions of current art to which he > contributed, while the drawing which was some years ago hung in the > permanent collection of the Leeds Public Art Gallery is alike worthy of the > collection and of the painter who will thus be lastingly commemorated in his > native town.

It comprises five species distributed in Angola, Cameroon, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia], Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of the Congo. Arthur Wallis Exell the British botanist who first formally described the genus named it after the stalks (ŒºŒØœÉœáŒøœÇ, m√≠schos, in Greek) that bears its reproductive (Œ≥œÖŒΩŒÆ, gun·∏ó, in Greek) structures. Description Mischogyne are bushes or small trees. Their trunks are straight or branching from the base. They have elliptical to oval leaves that are arranged in an alternate phyllotaxy. The leaves are paper to leathery with a dark green upper surface and a lighter green underside. The leaves can be hairless or covered in fine downy hairs. Their inflorescences have 1-2 flowers and are extra-axillary or terminal. Their flowers have both male and female reproductive structures. Their flowers have 3 sepals that either touch one another at their margins, or are fused until anthesis. Their flowers have 6 white, oval petals arranged in two rows of three. In the flowers, the receptacles form columns that bear stamens at their base and carpels at their apex. Each flower has numerous stamens that are arranged in a spiral phyllotaxy. The stamens have little or no filament, are linear, and deshisce laterally. The thecae extend along nearly the entire length of the stamen. The connective tissue between the thecae can be hairless or covered in fine downy hairs, and can sometimes terminate in a tuft of hairs at the apex of the stamen. The flowers have 3-40 cylindrical or oval carpels that are densely covered in fine downy hairs. The styles are short. The stigmas have two lobes. The carpels have numerous ovules. The fruit can be round, ellipsoidal or oblong and either hairless or covered in fine downy hairs. The fruit can be smooth or ribbed. The fruit have 3-12 seeds per carpel. The seeds are flat ellipsoids.

Education and career He graduated in 1933 with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the Milwaukee School of Engineering. At the University of Chicago he became in 1933 a graduate student in physics and received in 1936 a master's degree in mathematical physics. He continued to be affiliated with the University of Chicago until 1940 when he became the head of the physics and mathematics departments at Olivet College in Michigan. In early 1942 he returned to Chicago to work in Eugene Wigner's Theoretical Group developing nuclear reactors. Wigner claimed that Gale Young was his \\"main helper in 1942 in designing a nuclear pile cooled by water.\\" From 1942 to 1946 Young was a research associate on the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago's Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab). He later shared the patent for the design of water-cooled nuclear reactors. In 1946 he joined Wigner at the Clinton Laboratories, which was renamed Clinton National Laboratory in late 1947 and again renamed in January 1948 as Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). In 1948 Young and John R. Menke (1919‚Äì2009) founded Nuclear Development Associates (NDA), Inc., the first privately owned nuclear firm. Menke was the president and Young was the research director. When NDA was taken over by the United Nuclear Company, Young remained with the company until 1962. In 1962 he returned to ORNL as an assistant laboratory director, working on non-military applications of nuclear energy, especially desalination of seawater.

Because of the popularity of the surname at the time of the colonization, it is now most common in countries such as Colombia, Mexico and Venezuela, while relatively rare in Spain. The term Ni√±o has also been used as a nickname since at least the 13th century, when the ilegitimate son of King Alfonso X was known as \\"El Ni√±o\\".

The name of the band comes from the soap opera Mexican actor, Fernando Colunga Olivares. Band history The band was formed in 2010 by the actual line-up of Marko ≈Ωivkoviƒá, Stefan Milenkoviƒá and Antonio Jovanoviƒá. FCUE started as an informal side-project, formed mainly for recreative purp√≥ses; mixing the musical bases of genres like grindcore, with some comical and parodic lyrics about soap operas and various cultural icons like Steven Seagal. The name of the band was inspired by the famous Mexican actor, Fernando Colunga; who is compared by the line-up with the American actor Chuck Norris, due to the vast number of characters that Fernando Colunga interpreted in his career. Nevertheless, the band took a more professional course in the next years, starting with the releasing of their album Toxic hog cult, leaving away the grindcore background, and starting to show Death and roll influences. In 2019, the band gained considerable notoriety by the Latin American media (particularly in Mexico), given the characteristic name of the band. In the same year, FCUE released the single Inhale My Misery. The online magazine Helly Cherry described the new single of FCUE as a \\"stylistically completely different from everything recorded by the band during its first three years\\". A short time later, the band made the publication of their following single: La Usurpadora. This song continued with the musical maturation of the band, enjoying a relatively positive acceptance among the new fans. A demo song, Dia de Muertos, was published in November the 1st (Date in which the Day of the Dead is celebrated in Mexico). According to the German music distributor Fangtasia Studio, this work has an approach more similar to that of the oldest songs of the band, combining the styles of slamming death metal and grindcore.

Red Hill is in what is today North Tustin, California, Orange County. Red Hill has played an important part of history for the area. Red Hill is 347 feet tall, and 1,000 feet by 500 feet. Local Native Indian legends tell of tribes using the hill as a safe place during a flood covered and at time fires. Digs have found Indian artifacts on the hill. Gabrielino Indian called the Red Hill, Katuktu which translates to place of refuge. Under Spanish rule the hill was called Cerrito de las Ranas or just Las Ranas translated means Hill of the Frogs. Frogs were common on the swampy side of the hill. Sometimes also called Cerro Colorado translated means Red Hill. Under Mexican land grant times the hill was the boundary marker between Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana, Rancho San Joaquin and Rancho Lomas de Santiago. Red Hill was on land that was part of the form Mexican land grant of Jos√© Antonio Yorba. The land was on the coast of the Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana. In 1854, the Yorba family sold Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana to Jos√© Antonio Andr√©s Sep√∫lveda. Sep√∫lveda later lost the land due to bankruptcy caused by fighting to uphold his land claims in court. In 1866 much of the ranch was sold to James Irvine. James Irvine starting ranching the land. Red Hill's red soil was recognized as a source of mercury. Today we know that the red is due to high levels of cinnabar. In 1884 the first mining operation was started by the Rattlesnake Hill Mercury Mine. Red Hill is sometimes called Rattlesnake Hill from this mining operation. In 1890 the Irvine Ranch Company, now owned the land. Irvine Ranch Company dug two mines into the side of Red Hill and dug one 30-foot shaft down into Red Hill. In 1896 Irvine Ranch Company leased the hill to Thomas Harris, known as Shorty. Harris dug a new 70-foot shaft down the hill using Santa Clara Coal Mines workers till 1898. In 1899 E. J. Kimball and J. A. Turner signed a 10-year lease with Irvine. They had two new shafts dug removing 50 tons of ore. On Feb. 27, 1907, Red hill was sold to Felton P. Browning who mined mercury for the World War I efforts. In 1927 Charles McWalters leased Red Hill from Felton Browning. During World War II there were a few failed mining operations. Red Hill was the site of a number of abandoned mine, but most all are now closed off. The hill is now a private housing development. The name Red Hill can be found in the community around the hill, there are companies with Red Hill in their name, a street name, a school name, a church and a fire station.tustinhistory.com Red Hillochistorical, Jim Sleeper on Red Hill, December 21, 2016 770th MEETING OF THE MINERALOGICAL SOCIETY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, March 8, 2002  Markers Marker at the site reads: *'No. 203 RED HILL, In early descriptions it was known as Cerrito de las Ranas, meaning the Hill of the Frogs.

In 1896, Gross Point built a village hall to both house its government and serve as a community center. The two-story brick building has a Victorian design with two projecting front entrances, which originally led to the fire department and the village offices respectively. The small village relied heavily on alcohol taxes to fund its government, and had many taverns as a result; protests from prohibitionists in nearby Evanston, combined with opposition to new taxes to fund a sewer system, led to the village voting to dissolve itself in 1919.

Reed‚Äôs work as a postdoctoral research associate with the Institute of Human Origins (1995-1997) brought her to ASU when IHO moved there in 1997. Reed next became an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anthropology at ASU (1997). The Department of Anthropology became the School of Human Evolution and Social Change in 2005. From 2002 to 2012, Reed held the role of Associate Professor at the newly formed SHESC. Reed was Associate Director of SHESC from 2006 to 2008, and again from 2014 to 2016.

Reed won the Outstanding Faculty Member Award from the Faculty Women's Association at ASU in 2013. In 2014, Reed was named a President‚Äôs Professor at ASU.  Research  Reed is especially interested in mammalian and primate diversity and biogeography. Reed uses large comparative data sets to interpret the community structure of fossils mammals from various Plio-Pleistocene sites. Since 2002 she has directed the Ledi-Geraru Research Project, located in the Afar Region of the Lower Awash Valley in Ethiopia. Reed and her team are looking for fossils to help them understand the disappearance of Australopithecus afarensis and the later appearance of Homo in the region. They have discovered sediments dating from 2.95 to 2.4 Ma, which is a rarity in the Lower Awash Valley. Many of Reed‚Äôs other projects were focused in South Africa. She studied in the Makapansgat Valley in 1994 and then from 1998 until 2003. She worked to reconstruct the habitat and ecology of Au. africanus. Reed concluded that Au. africanus was not able to tolerate more arid and open habitats and suggested that a longer dry season eventually caused the extinction of the species. Outside of South Africa, Reed traveled to the Bouri Peninsula in Eritrea in 1997, and she worked at the Contrebandiers Cave in Morocco from 2006 until 2008. In addition to her research in Africa, Reed has conducted field work in the Crazy Mountain Basin in Montana in 1990, in Cabeza Blanca, Chubut, Argentina in 1993, and in the Sope√±a Cave in Asturias, Spain from 2004 to 2006.

Powers The MFSA has the powers to regulate, monitor, and supervise the financial sector of Malta, protecting the interests of the consumers and promoting the market transparency and efficiency. It has the powers to review business practices, advise the government on policies, and to investigate potential harmful and unfair practices in the financial industry. International relations The MFSA is a member of the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, the European Securities and Markets Authority, the International Organization of Securities Commissions, and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors.  Demerger  The MFSA was demerged from the Registry of Companies in 2018 in order to focus on its regulatory role and duties. The Registry of Companies is now a stand-alone agency and is now known as the Malta Business Registry (MBR). Notable cases and controversies In June 2016, the MFSA drew criticism from the MEP Sven Giegold for poor regulatory supervision of the Maltese financial institutions. In March 2018, the MFSA took control of Pilatus Bank, a Maltese bank headed by Ali Sadr Hasheminejad, whose money laundering scheme of sanctioned Iranian money was exposed by late Daphne Caruana Galizia. Later, in June, the MFSA asked the European Central Bank to withdraw Pilatus Bank's licence. In July of the same year, Pilatus Bank's depositors threatened to sue the MFSA for freezing ‚Ç¨80 million in funds held by \\"innocent victims.\\" In October, the bank's directors followed with their own lawsuit to the MFSA. Finally, in November 2018, the bank's European licence has been withdrawn by the ECB. In October 2018, the MFSA froze the assets of SataBank due to anti-money laundering concerns. The freeze resulted in vocal criticism of the bank's account holders. The bank is co-owned by Christo Georgiev, the owner of LeoPay startup. In August 2019, the Malta Financial Services Authority became embroiled in scandal after paying ‚Ç¨150,000 severance to its human resources department director, George Spiteri, who later was rehired for a similar position by the Malta Business Registry, which branched out of the MFSA just a few weeks earlier.

B. Yeats. It was first printed in 1897 in British magazine The Sketch under the title \\"A Mad Song.\\" It was then published under its standard name in Yeats' 1899 anthology The Wind Among the Reeds. It is especially remembered for its two final lines: \\"The silver apples of the moon,/ The golden apples of the sun.\\" The poem is told from the point of view of an old man who, at some point in his past, had a fantastical experience in which a silver trout fish he had caught and laid on the floor turned into a \\"glimmering girl\\" who called him by his name, then vanished; he became infatuated with her, and remains devoted to finding her again. In an 1899 letter to fellow poet Dora Sigerson, Yeats called \\"The Song of Wandering Aengus\\" \\"the kind of poem I like best myself‚Äîa ballad that gradually lifts ... from circumstantial to purely lyrical writing.\\" Meaning and inspiration Yeats later said that \\"the poem was suggested to me by a Greek folk song; but the folk belief of Greece is very like that of Ireland, and I certainly thought, when I wrote it, of Ireland, and of the spirits that are in Ireland.\\" At least one scholar has pointed to the Greek folk song \\"The Fruit of the Apple Tree\\" as the likely source of Yeats' inspiration. That song was included in a volume of Greek poetry translated by Lucy Garnett, which Yeats had written a review of in 1896. It has been claimed that the poem's story is based on the Irish god Aengus, and specifically the story of the \\"Dream of Aengus\\", which had first appeared in the 8th century, in which Aengus falls in love with a woman whom he sees only in his dreams. The poem has also been compared to the aisling genre of Irish poetry, in which a magical woman appears who represents the country of Ireland. Cultural references Both \\"The silver apples of the moon\\" and \\"The golden apples of the sun\\" have inspired the names of various bands (including the Silver Apples), albums, books (including Ray Bradbury's anthology The Golden Apples of the Sun) and films. Parts of the poem have been recited in the 2002 episode \\"Rogue Planet\\" of the TV series Star Trek: Enterprise, as well as in the 2015 episode \\"No Room at the Inn\\" of the TV series The Leftovers. In the 1995 movie (also a novel by Robert James Waller) The Bridges of Madison County, when going for a walk after supper Robert Kincaid (Clint Eastwood) quotes the lines \\"The silver apples of the moon\\" and \\"The golden apples of the sun.\\" Francesca Johnson (Meryl Streep) replies, \\"Yeats.\\" Clint Eastwood's character talks about the themes of the poem and references his own Irish heritage. Later that night, she is alone on the porch reading Yeats' book of poems. Inspired, Francesca writes a note and drives to post it on Roseman bridge for Robert to find the next day. The note asks him for supper and quotes another line, \\"While white moths are on the wing.\\" Musical adaptations The most famous musical setting of the poem was by Travis Edmonson of the folk duo Bud & Travis. Edmonson titled the song \\"Golden Apples of the Sun\\", and it was released on the 1960 Bud & Travis album Naturally: Folk Songs for the Present. Their version has been covered, sometimes as \\"Golden Apples of the Sun\\" and sometimes as \\"The Song of Wandering Aengus\\", by artists including Judy Collins (on the album Golden Apples of the Sun, 1962), Terry Callier (on The New Folk Sound of Terry Callier, 1965), Dave Van Ronk (on No Dirty Names, 1966), Christy Moore (on Ride On, 1984), Karan Casey (on Songlines, 1997), Paul Winter (on Celtic Solstice, 1999), 10,000 Maniacs (on Twice Told Tales, 2015) and Tiny Ruins (on Hurtling Through, 2015). British singer Donovan recorded his own musical setting of the poem on the 1971 children's album HMS Donovan. British-Irish band The Waterboys recorded their own musical adaptation of \\"The Song of Wandering Aengus\\" on the 2011 Yeats-themed album An Appointment with Mr Yeats. It was also put to music by Benjamin Attahir. References Category:1897 poems Category:Poetry by W. B.

The estate is now owned by the Jarl Foundation and operated as an educational centre for agriculture students under the name Frihedslund L√¶rerg√•rd. History C. W. Eckersberg:Frederik Hoppe Arnoldus von Falkenskiold, a colonel, bought the manor of S√¶bygaard in 1779. He turned the farm Falkenh√∏j into a separate manor in 1787 and in 1790 he also detached another manor which was given the name Frihedslund. He sold S√¶bygaard instead acquired at Sophienberg at H√∏rsholm in 1797. He also kept Frihedslund for a few more years. In around 1800, Falkenskiold sold Frihedslund to Count Christian Rantzau-Ascheberg, who had recently acquired S√∏bygaard. Both estates were shortly thereafter sold to general war commissioner Haagen Christian Astrup. In 1806, he sold them to Frederik Hoppe. In 1809, Frederik Hoppe sold Frihedslund to A.H. Bachmann. Bachmann's heirs sold the estate to Countess Agnethe Rosencrone who later that same year sold it again. Harald Rothe The new owner was major Harald Rothe. He had bought the estates Aggersvold at Jyderup in 1806 and Egholm at Roskilde in 1809 and had that same year been ennobled by letters patent. He was the son of Casper Peter Rothe Edle Cathrine Severine Soelberg of Urup Manior at Horsens. His wife, Wilhelmine Antoinette Fix, was a daughter of the merchant Johan Leonhard Fix. Harald Rothe's hairs sold the estate to first lieutenant Jacob Vilhelm Saxtorph in 1850. His son, Sylvester Saxtorph, a prominent medical doctor, was born on the estate in 1851. Valdemar Hvist, a son of the wealthy merchant and politician Lauritz Nicolai Hvidt, purchased Frihedslund in 1859.

The railway is operated by the Peruvian Ministry of Transport and Communications (MTC) but is expected to be operated as a concession from the end of 2019. History This railway was authorised by law 667 of November 20, 1907. The first studies were carried out by Mr. Carlos Weber. That same year the work began but construction was very slow and was stopped in 1910. On September 2, 1910 Carlos B. Eddy and the government signed a contract for the construction to continue from the point at which it had stopped. No work was done under this new contract and the works were eventually restarted by the government itself in 1918. The railway opened on 24 October 1926. The railway was converted to between 2006 and 2010 by the neighboring Ferrocarril Central Andino. Route description The Huancayo - Huancavelica railway is a mountain railway in the Peruvian central highlands and one of the highest railways in the world. At its lowest point it is still 2,819 metres above sea level. It runs through districts of Huancayo, Huanc√°n, Huayucachi, Viques and Cullhuas in the Jun√≠n region, and those of √ëahuimpuquio, Mariscal C√°ceres, Izcuchaca, Pilchaca, Cuenca, Acoria, Yauli and Huancavelica in Huancavelica region. The train travels parallel to the Mantaro River to the city of La Mejorada, then uphill parallel to the Ichu river, during the tour you will observe a variable and beautiful landscape with occasional small villages. It is a rustic journey and the train frequently sees visits from vendors with snacks. It is also possible to see some works done by the ancient inhabitants of these towns and villages such as the Colonial Bridge of Izcuchaca, the thermal baths of Aguas Calientes, the rustic stations and the spectacular road engineering of the railway. The line is known as El Tren Macho (The Male Train) because some years ago the line did not have the best technical attention and a local creative legend evolved suggesting that the train ‚Äúleaves when he wants and arrives when he can‚Äù! Services Tha service in summer 2019 is 3 trains per week using locomotive hauled trains with buffet and 1st class coaches, the buffet class being superior to 1st class. Departure times are: From Huancayo to Huancavelica on Monday, Wednesday and Friday depart at 0630, arrive at 1200.

He played an instrumental role in the establishment of the French Protectorate of Cambodia. Ordained in 1830, Miche entered entered the seminary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (M.E.P.) in 1835. After a brief course on the geography of Southeast Asia, Miche departed for Cochinchina the next year. After sojourns in Malaysia, Siam, and the Mekong Delta, Miche arrived in Battambang in December 1838. Miche was forced to leave about a year later, when Ang Em, a rebelling prince of Cambodia, declared himself king of Battambang, and the town was all but emptied of its inhabitants. He traveled up a tributary of the Ba River to the Central Highlands of Vietnam, hoping to convert the Montagnard people to the Catholic faith. Minh M·∫°ng, the Emperor of Vietnam, who was opposed to missionaries, had him arrested. Minh M·∫°ng's successor, Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã, however, pardoned him in 1843 after an appeal by King Louis Philippe I of France. Miche continued his mission in Cambodia and Laos. In 1856, under instructions from French diplomat Louis Charles de Montigny, Miche unsuccessfully petitioned King Ang Duong of Cambodia to accept French protection to free his country from the influence of Siam. Duong's death in 1860 triggered a political crisis when his successor Norodom's brothers, Sisowath and Si Votha, rebelled. Norodom was forced out of the country and into Siam. Miche, together with five French soldiers, organized an army that expelled the rebels. By around 1863‚Äì1864, Miche had secured Norodom's trust and Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e, a French naval officer, convinced Norodom to allow the establishment of the French Protectorate of Cambodia. Miche continued his missionary activities in Indochina until his death in 1873 in Saigon. Early life and career Jean-Claude Miche was born on 9 August 1805 in Bruy√®res, Vosges, France, the youngest of many siblings; he had four sisters and six brothers born from two marriages. The family, mostly farmers and artisans, had been living in the Vosges for a century. For Jean-Claude to take on a religious career was not typical of the family, although one of his brothers, Joseph-Victor, also became a priest. After studying in Senaide, Jean-Claude Miche attended the seminary of Foucharupt in Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges. He was ordained on 5 June 1830 in Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges and was sent as a vicar to the parish in Moyenmoutier where his brother Joseph-Victor was the curate. Two years later, he was transferred to Fraize, where he remained until he entered the seminary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society (MEP) on 10 September 1835. The course was a brief one, providing him with basic geographical knowledge about his approximate posting, but not the language, which he was supposed to learn during the six-month sea voyage. Following tradition, Miche only learned the exact location of his mission, Cochinchina, during the sending off ceremony in the MEP chapel of the Rue du Bac. A few days later, on 27 February 1836, he departed on the mission. Arrival in Cochinchina Emperor Minh M·∫°ng of Vietnam Miche could not proceed directly to Cochinchina because of the persecution of Christians there. After passing through Singapore, he reached the College General in Penang, Malaysia, and stayed there for a while. Arriving in the Mekong Delta later in 1836, Miche was assigned to the central and southern Vietnam mission. He was responsible for missionary work with the Cambodian, Lao, and Montagnard peoples. Afterwards, Miche moved to Bangkok in Siam, where he studied the Khmer language under Cambodian Christians who had fled persecution. In 1838, he finally moved into Cambodia, traveling with a fellow missionary, Pierre Duclos, to Paknam by boat and then through the jungle to Battambang on foot. They arrived in Battambang in time to celebrate Midnight Mass on 25 December 1838. Miche and Duclos' time in Battambang among a congregation of mostly Chinese merchants and mixed-race descendants of Portuguese was cut short just a year later. Ang Em, a rebelling Cambodian prince, had declared himself king of Battambang. During the insurrection, the town was almost completely emptied of its inhabitants, prompting the two missionaries to leave in search of a new town for their work. On 7 January 1840, they left for Bangkok, arriving on 2 February 1841. In early 1842, Miche and another priest traveled from central Vietnam up a tributary of the Ba River to the Central Highlands of Vietnam where the Montagnard people live, hoping to convert them to Christianity. Minh M·∫°ng, the Emperor of Vietnam, was opposed to the introduction of Christianity and Vietnamese troops arrested the priests when they reached the first Montagnard villages. They were taken to Hue, spent time in many prisons, were tortured, and were sentenced to death. Minh M·∫°ng's successor, Thi·ªáu Tr·ªã, however, pardoned them on 19 March 1843 after an appeal by King Louis Philippe I of France. Miche left Vietnam on a French navy ship. Cambodia King Norodom of Cambodia Miche continued his missionary activities, this time from near Phnom Penh in Cambodia. He was consecrated titular bishop of Dansara on 13 June 1847 by Dominique Lef√®bvre. He was again tasked with evangelizing in Cambodia and Laos. In early 1849, Miche left for an excursion inland up the Mekong, but his boat was not fit for the conditions and he only reached Sambok in Cambodia. In 1850, the Cambodian mission was separated from the southernmost Vietnam mission. Miche was appointed apostolic vicar of Cambodia and was now in charge of evangelizing Laos. The task continued to prove difficult. Although two missionaries had managed to settle among the Montagnards in 1850, the mission lacked resources. Miche again tried to travel inland, this time during the rainy season when the river was much more navigable. He hoped to visit and review the work of French priests who were living among the Stung Treng and learning to speak Lao. In July 1853, he reached the southern edge of the lands of the Lao people, but found them even less willing to convert than the Cambodians. In 1854, Miche proposed a conference in Bangkok to concentrate evangelization efforts in Laos, but the political situation in the area was becoming tense and hampered his activities. In 1856, French diplomat Louis Charles de Montigny instructed Miche to petition King Ang Duong of Cambodia to accept French protection to free his country from the influence of Siam. Miche had drafted a letter requesting protectorate status for Duong to send to Emperor Napoleon III of France. Miche failed to persuade Duong to seek France's protection. Duong's death in 1860 triggered a political crisis in the kingdom. His son Norodom was elected king and his brothers, Sisowath and Si Votha, rebelled against him, forcing him to flee to Siam. Miche, together with five French soldiers, organized an army that expelled the rebels and allowed Norodom, with the help of French authorities, to return as king. By around 1863‚Äì1864, Miche had secured Norodom's trust and Ernest Doudart de Lagr√©e, a French naval officer, convinced Norodom to allow the establishment of the French Protectorate of Cambodia. Miche had become the most important of all missionaries in Cambodia. Later years and death Miche spent the rest of his life engaged in missionary activities. He founded churches and schools in Indochina. He authored a Latin-Cambodian dictionary. A number of his letters chronicling his times were published in the (1863). Miche died on 1 December 1873 in Saigon. His funeral three days later culminated in a procession of two hundred carriages to the tomb of Pierre Pigneau de Behaine, a famed French missionary, five kilometers outside of the city. Miche's remains were repatriated to France after the Indochina War and inhumed in the crypt of the MEP chapel on 29 April 1983. Miche is recognized as an early European influence in the Indochina region and instrumental in the establishment of the French Protectorate of Cambodia. He was also an early Western observer of Buddhism in the region and made some unflattering remarks about that faith.

It is a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Tritoniidae. A monotypic genus, the only species is Tritoniella belli. The genus and species were both described in 1907 by the British diplomat and malacologist Charles Eliot. Description Tritoniella belli can grow to a length of up to . The edge of the mantle is wavy and either smooth or with finger-like protuberances. Most individuals have a ridge running along the middle of the back. The colour is variable, ranging from a translucent milky white to yellow or orange. Distribution Tritoniella belli is found around the coasts of Antarctica and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands at depths down to about . Ecology Tritoniella belli is a common species of nudibranch in the shallow waters of McMurdo Sound in Antarctica. Its diet mostly consists of the soft coral Clavularia frankliniana, but it may also feed on other soft corals, hydroids and sea anemones. C. frankliniana contains the distasteful chemical chimyl alcohol, and the nudibranch incorporates this into its own tissues, using it as a chemical defence to make itself unpalatable. It is avoided by the predatory starfishes Odontaster validus, Perknaster fuscus and Acodontaster conspicuus because the mucus it extrudes is distasteful; it is preyed on by the sea anemone Isotealia antarctica, but 70% of the encounters between the two result in the nudibranch escaping, or the sea anemone swallowing the nudibranch but then regurgitating it from its gastrovascular cavity. The gelatinous egg ribbons of the nudibranch are also eaten by I. antarctica but rejected by O. validus.

First elected in 1903 for a two- year term, Woodruff was a Republican. He served in that position for 24 years non-consecutively.  Biography  Woodruff was born on February 2, 1862 to Nelson and Mary Woodruff. His father owned the Woodruff Ice Company, which Edward would later take over and make a small fortune from. Woodruff was married to Anna Schmidt for more than forty years. They had one daughter, Mary, who took care of Woodruff after the death of his wife. = Political career = Woodruff began his career in elected office as alderman for the 1st ward for two terms starting in 1899. Peoria Historian Norm Kelley said it was in this first position that Woodruff learned how to effectively spar with his political adversaries. After serving as Alderman, he was elected mayor for the first time in 1903 and was subsequently reelected to two-year terms in 1909, 1911, 1913, 1915, 1917, 1919, 1923, 1929 and 1935. His last reelection victory in 1941 was for his only four-year term. Some of his achievements included the construction of the First National Bank Building, the Pere Marquette Hotel, the Peoria Municipal Tuberculosis Sanitarium, the City Garbage Department Building and the long awaited Cedar Street Bridge. He also improved the conditions of the police and fire departments, widened Jefferson Street, added almost 40 miles of paved sidewalks and established Eckwood Park. Woodruff built a political machine through patronage, telling reporters \\"The boys that can deliver the votes are the boys that get the jobs.\\" He would often conduct the business of this machine at his beached house boat known as the \\"Bum Boat\\" located north of Peoria along the Illinois River near Rome, Illinois. Woodruff unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomination for Governor of Illinois in 1920. He finished third in a four-way primary, garnering just 4.26% of the vote. The only county Woodruff was able to win was his native Peoria County where he won 45.98% of the vote. Woodruff died on December 22, 1947 after battling an illness for three months. He was buried at his family's plot at Springdale Cemetery. Woodruff Career and Technical Center, formerly known as E.N. Woodruff High School, was named in his honor. The school adopted one of Woodruff's many nicknames as their mascot, the \\"Woodruff Warriors\\".

Its main objective was to aid Yugoslav Partisans, lead by Marshall Tito, in preventing German withdrawal from Greece and Albania via Montenegro, and \\"to give the greatest possible artillery support to the Yugoslav National Army of Liberation\\".McConville, p. 273 It was a continuation of the British Government policy of support and supply that started with the Maclean Mission and culminated in Tito's meeting with Winston Churchill in Naples in August 1943.Maclean (1991), pp. 457-469  Background  As Allied troops from the East and West were moving towards Berlin, they realised that large German military formations such as Army Group E will eventually abandon Greece, Albania and Yugoslavia and withdraw to defence lines further north. This would reinvigorate and resupply their troops in the region and likely extend the war.McConville, p. 273 In September 1944, Operation Ratweek was launched, aiming to frustrate German movements through Serbia, Croatia and Slovenia.McConville, p. 268 Now, the movement via the secondary route in Montenegro had to be disrupted as well. Very mountainous terrain did not land itself well to aerial bombardment so heavy artillery and land troops had to be deployed. The Partisans, used to hand-to-hand, small-arms warfare had neither the long-range guns nor the experience.McConville, p. 280  Arrival  The force consisted of batteries from the 111 Field Regiment, No. 43 Commando Unit and a field unit of Royal Engineers. Commanded by Brigadier J P O'Brien- Twohig, it sailed in four Tank Landing Craft (LCT) and three Infantry Landing Craft (LCI) from Bari to Dubrovnik on 27 October 1944 and arrived the following day.McConville, pp. 273-275Williams, p. 232 Their first target was to block the German breakout at Risan, along the coastal route of the Bay of Kotor. Dedicated group, named Finney Force was assembled for the task. It consisted of 211 Field Battery with eight field-guns and 'C' Troop of the No. 43 Commando. The Battery Commander Major Pat Turner was in overall command, while the 'C' Troop was led by Captain Robert Loundoun. The two commanders travelled via Trebinje, Bileƒáa i Vilusi, to reach Podhan - a strategic location from which they could see and shell the German troops in the town of Risan, Ledenice barracks and in five old Imperial Austrian forts nearby. They arrived on 29 October, preparing for the first battle the following morning.McConville, pp. 275-277  Risan Operation  The advanced guard of the German Army Group E, found from the XXI Mountain Corps, had already entered Montenegro and used a narrow, meandering road that follows the Bay of Kotor fjord eventually reaching Risan. Both the Partisans and the British gunners on the high rock shelf, 1,600 feet above the Bay, could see German movements and once the weather had cleared, heavy bombardment started. After seeing the volume and accuracy of the shelling the Germans realised that they were not dealing with the traditional Partisan fighters, but much better trained and equipped army units. Some tried to surrender to the British troops, hoping for a better treatment, but it was already agreed that all POWs were to be handed over to the Partisans.McConville, pp. 278-281 By 4 November, the bombardment had been so heavy that an attempt was made to ask Germans to surrender. They were barricaded in a local sawmill and hospital. The negotiations failed, and the hostilities continued. On 7 November, the first German fort was breached, and two days later the second. Germans were trying to send reinforcements from Kotor to Risan via the narrow and winding road. They also assembled a force at Mostar, 75 miles north-west, in order to free them up, but these were successfully contained by the local Partisans.McConville, pp. 281-284 By this time the decision has been made to blow up the road and at least damage it enough to prevent heavy vehicles crossing. Capt Loundoun led the expedition which laid the explosive in a culvert about two miles from Risan. The operation was successful.McConville, pp. 285-286 By 17 November, the last three forts fell and Ledenice barracks surrendered with 43 dead, over 70 wounded and 197 unhurt German soldiers. Shortly after, the Germans withdrew from Risan as well, and the town was taken over by the Partisans. One of the three routes, the southernmost one, was now closed off and the Finney Force achieved its objective and withdrew to Bileƒáa to wait further instructions.McConville, pp. 286-291  Podgorica Operation and the withdrawal  The second, central, route for withdrawal was via Danilovgrad and Nik≈°iƒá. British contingent consisting of Raiding Support Regiment, a troop of 43 Commando and No. 579 Field Company of the Royal Engineers gathered the troops and heavy artillery at Nik≈°iƒá and prepared to demolish the 150 yards-long stone bridge nearby, should a need arise. However, the Partisans were able to enter Danilovgrad, thus making this route impassable for the German troops, leaving them with only one, most difficult, northernmost route via Kola≈°in.McConville, pp.298-299 The bulk of German troops was already on Montenegrin territory, in the town of Podgorica, desperate for a passage north. On 5 December, Major W.H. Cheesman took a convoy of troops, heavy guns and a detachment of sappers with a flat-packed Bailey bridge to Risan. They knew the terrain well, as they had been monitoring and shelling it for weeks already. Once in Risan, they followed the road onto Kotor installing and crossing the Bailey bridge on the way. After a couple of days on the coast, the mission reached Cetinje on 9 December. Just as they were preparing to continue onto Podgorica, an order was received to return all the way back to Vilusi, where their journey had started. They duly withdrew, taking back the Bailey bridge as ordered.McConville, pp. 299-305 Meanwhile, the troops remaining in Nik≈°iƒá prepared to move onto Danilovgrad, via a heavily damaged road. They passed the town on 13 December and started amassing the firepower towards Podgorica and the road to Bioƒçe, German's last remaining route. Heavy shelling had started and lasted until 19 December together with the aerial bombardment by the Balkan Air Force. Podgorica was freed, and the chase of the Germans onto Bioƒçe and Kola≈°in continued. By 22 December, there was a diminishing number of targets that could be visually identified, and the risk of shooting at Partisans in error increased. This was the last day of British active intervention and the troops and the equipment were brought back to Italy to assist in the campaign the following month.McConville, pp. 305-313  Controversies  Floydforce was an unusual and somewhat strained operation. It spanned significant ideological, geopolitical and military contradictions. At the same time, the Partisans feared a bigger British landing and intervention. British Government still hosted and supported the Royal Yugoslav Government-in-Exile as well as King Peter II of Yugoslavia. Finally, the future of Istria, Rijeka and Trieste was yet to be decided. Winston Churchill thought of this as the key stumbling block and wrote to Tito on 3 December: Tito was visiting Stalin in Moscow, when the news of British units arrival broke out. Tito reassured Stalin that it must have been just a few batteries of artillery that he had asked for. Stalin then questioned what would he do if the British really tried to land against his will in Yugoslavia. \\"We should offer determined resistance.\\" - came Tito's reply.Maclean (1957), p. 245  References   Sources   *  External links  *Robert Loundoun's obituary in the Independent Category:Eastern European theatre of World War II Category:Yugoslavia in World War II Category:United Kingdom‚ÄìYugoslavia relations ","title":"Floydforce"},{"id":"61795232","text":"The Funduloidea is a superfamily of fishes in the suborder Cyprinodontoidei, one of two suborders which make up the order Cyprinodontiformes.

Disappearance Summers was last seen at around 6:00 p.m. on July 4, 2007. She was last seen in the area of West 96th Street and Madison Avenue. Earlier that day, Summers went to a pool party at which she was the only guest. After spending a few hours swimming in the pool, she decided to visit her aunt Christina, who lived within a 10-minute walking distance away from the pool, but never arrived. Because she was frequently staying with her relatives, her disappearance went unnoticed until two days later. Her great-uncle Kevin Donathan said that he spoke with Summers on the morning of the day of her disappearance. Donathan grabbed Summers' phone and broke it, depriving Summers of her ability to contact her family or friends. At the time of her disappearance, Summers had a tattoo of a heart and the word \\"Gene,\\" in reference to Gene Gill, a boy whom she was dating at the time. Investigation Summers was initially considered a runaway, due to her history with her family in the weeks leading up to her disappearance, including the rebellious act of getting a tattoo without her mother's permission. Even so, a week after Summers disappeared, her family banded together to search the neighborhood and surrounding areas for the girl. The FBI later speculated that she may have been kidnapped and that her disappearance might have been related to those of Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus, who vanished in Cleveland in 2003 and 2004, respectively. On May 6, 2013, Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus were found alive and rescued from a house on Seymour Avenue. Police also found a third captive, Michelle Knight, who had been missing since 2002. Although Berry and DeJesus were well-known almost as soon as they disappeared, Knight received very little, if any, attention prior to their rescue and was absent from the FBI's missing persons database for most of the time she spent in the house. There was initially speculation that Summers may have also been a captive in that house, but no evidence of this was ever found. On June 16, 2013, family and friends of Summers celebrated her twentieth birthday by passing out fliers and releasing balloons at West 110th and Lorain Avenue. On November 7, 2018, police and the FBI visited Holmden Avenue, a location that Summers was known to visit. Authorities looked behind a home on Holmden Avenue, and uncovered new information on possible times and locations at which Summers might have been spotted before she disappeared. Reported sightings In August 2007, one month after Summers went missing, her family received a phone call from a girl, believed to be Summers herself, telling them not to worry and that she was safe. In early 2015, there were rumors that Summers had been spotted at an ATM in Rhode Island. The rumors were dismissed later that year, on July 6, 2015, two days after the eighth anniversary of her disappearance, when the FBI determined that the woman in the picture was not Summers. Legal proceedings On December 4, 2018, Kevin Donathan was charged with rape, but has not been named a suspect in Summers' disappearance. On February 25, 2020, Donathan, 55, was sentenced to 35 years in prison on charges of rape and prostitution. Cultural significance Summers was featured in a section of the show Oprah in October 2009, along with other missing people, including Sabrina Aisenberg and Jacob Wetterling, who disappeared in 1998 and 1989, respectively. Wetterling was found dead in 2016.

The term reflects a concern with extending the focus of poverty studies beyond the physical manifestations of poverty to include also vulnerability and social exclusion. The term sustainable refers to an individual's ability to provide for themselves in such a manner that is viable long term. Sustainability also refers to the ability to undergo external shocks or stresses and recover from such traumas through maintaining or improving one's livelihood. The sustainable livelihood framework provides a structure for holistic poverty alleviation action. Holland, Jeremy and James Blackburn. Whose Voice? Participatory Research and Policy Change.

Authors Gibson-Graham, Cameron, and Healy highlight the measure of well-being and how an individual's well-being contributes to their ability to survive well. ‚ÄúTake Back Work.‚Äù Take Back the Economy: an Ethical Guide for Transforming Our Communities, by J. K. Gibson-Graham et al., University of Minnesota Press, 2013. =Brundtland commission= The sustainable livelihoods idea was first introduced by the Brundtland Commission on Environment and Development, and the 1992 United Nation‚Äôs Conference on Environment and Development expanded the concept, advocating for the achievement of sustainable livelihoods as a broad goal for poverty eradication. In 1992 Robert Chambers and Gordon Conway WCED 1987a: 2-5 are (source from IDS Disc paper 296) proposed the following composite definition of a sustainable rural livelihood, which is applied most commonly at the household level: \\"A livelihood comprises the capabilities, assets (stores, resources, claims and access) and activities required for a means of living: a livelihood is sustainable which can cope with and recover from stress and shocks, maintain or enhance its capabilities and assets, and provide sustainable livelihood opportunities for the next generation; and which contributes net benefits to other livelihoods at the local and global levels and in the short and long term.\\" http://www.humanecologyreview.org/pastissues/her131/knutsson.pdf (source needs to be vetted ~~~~) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brundtland_Commission =Individual well-being= In an analysis of various 24 hour clocks, Gibson- Graham et al. synthesize five categories for overall well-being: Material, Occupational, Social, Community, and Physical Take back the Economy, Ch: Take Back Work, page 21-22 . Holistic interventions prove to be challenging to measure, furthermore, quantitative data on qualitative phenomena (such as well-being) is similarly challenging to record. Models for a sustainable livelihood approach There are several organizations incorporating a Sustainable Livelihood approach into their ongoing poverty alleviation efforts ; the models by which they adapt the Sustainable Livelihood approach are discussed below. =UNDP= The United Nations Development Programme utilizes a sustainable livelihood approach to development through the evaluation of different types of capital . The UNDP identifies five key types of capital: human, social, natural, physical, and financial. The access individuals have to these assets determines how the UNDP designs initiatives to directly or indirectly facilitate development. The UNDP also uses an asset based approach to poverty alleviation, examining how individuals leverage assets and cope with external sources of shock or stress. =CARE= CARE (Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere) focuses on emergency relief administration and long term development programs. In 1994, CARE developed a Household Livelihood Security framework to better monitor, evaluate, and track the work they conduct. CARE's application of a sustainable livelihood framework moves away from a sectorial approach and focuses on holistic development techniques. =DFID= The Department for International Development is the United Kingdom's department dedicated to eradicating extreme poverty and administering foreign aid. The DFID leverages a sustainable livelihoods framework to focus holistically on activities directly related to improving an individual's livelihood. Human-centered, multi-leveled, sustainable, and dynamic initiatives are all incorporated into the DFID's measures.

Editorial history The comic book event was first announced in March at the 2019 Chicago Comic & Entertainment Expo, followed by an online press conference. Donny Cates announced that Carnage would be the main villain, and that the story would involve all Marvel characters who have used a symbiote at some point and reference older stories involving Venom. He said that \\"Cletus Kasady is back, and he is deadlier than he‚Äôs ever been. Absolute Carnage encompasses every single character who has ever worn a symbiote and every symbiote that has ever been, going all the way back to when Peter found the black suit. Going from there to Maximum Carnage to Venomized to everything... everyone is a target.\\" It was followed by several comics with variant cover arts with their characters reimagined with the Carnage symbiote. The tie-ins were announced on May. They would feature Spider-Man, Venom, Deadpool, Miles Morales, Iron Fist and Scream, among others. Plot =Issue 1= Chapter 1: The Bleeding King While walking to Times Square, Eddie Brock explains to his son Dylan about how the Symbiotes were created by Knull as well as the Church of the New Darkness having resurrected Cletus Kasady. Upon arrival, Eddie notices that there are wanted posters for Venom for the deaths of Lee Price and several inmates at Ryker's Island. When they flee into the subway upon being trailed by a man in a trenchcoat, they encounter Cletus Kasady who shoves them onto the subway tracks. They are saved by the man in the trenchcoat who is actually the Venom symbiote in disguise. The Venom symbiote re-bonds to Eddie where it states to him that it has fully recovered from the dark magic that it absorbed. A pair of police officers arrive and hold Venom at gunpoint. When the train explodes, Venom shields Dylan as Dark Carnage appears. The Dark Carnage stands at 13 ft., is colored black and red with a white spiral on its head, a gaping maw, a skeletal appearance, and a white dragon emblem on its chest. Venom tells the police officers to get Dylan far away from here as possible while he confronts Dark Carnage where he notices that Cletus' body is bonded to the Grendel symbiote. As Dark Carnage tries to rip the Venom symbiote off of Eddie, he claims that Knull is coming to destroy everything. Eddie uses the electrical rails of the subway to disable Dark Carnage as it briefly separates to reveal Cletus' corpse. While recuperating at an apartment, Eddie and Dylan are visited by Robbie Robertson. He notices Eddie's condition and calls Peter Parker.Absolute Carnage #1. Marvel Comics. Chapter 2: The God Son Sometime later at The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, Spider-Man meets with Eddie and Dylan where he hears about Cletus being bonded to the Carnage symbiote, the approach of Knull as well as Eddie's encounters with Roland Treece and the Dinosaur People. Their discussion is interrupted by a news report about some bodies Angelo Fortunato, Carl Mach, Leslie Gesneria, and Thaddeus Ross where Eddie suspects that Anne Weying might be among the bodies in the pit. After thwarting a robbery, Spider-Man states to Eddie that he would ask Mister Fantastic for a solution that involves extracting the codices without killing people, but the timeline is unfeasible causing Eddie to take Spider-Man to meet with Maker. At the house of \\"Rex Strickland,\\" Spider-Man and Venom meet Maker who is working on the S.C.I.T.H.E. (short for Symbiote Codex Isolation and Thermo-Heated Extraction) that was commissioned by Project Oversight. Normie Osborn was brought to Maker as he and Dylan get acquainted. When Spider-Man would not let the S.C.I.T.E. be tested on Dylan, Maker states that he wants to test it on Norman Osborn. Chapter 3: The Long Red Dark Spider-Man and Venom head to Ravencroft where Venom recalls when Norman Osborn bonded with the Carnage symbiote. Arriving at the maximum security cell block, Eddie confronts Norman Osborn. Meanwhile, John Jameson meets with Spider-Man as he states that Venom is his ally. When they meet up with Venom near Norman Osborn's cell, Spider-Man and Venom notice John Jameson in pain as it is revealed that Dark Carnage has bonded to him. As John Jameson fully turns into Dark Carnage, he informs Spider-Man that Knull is coming. Elsewhere in Ravencroft, Cletus is walking through the halls as he exposes his ribs to unleash the maggots in order for them to have the inmates be bonded to the Grendel symbiote. The inmates are transformed by the symbiotes into creatures that resemble Doppelganger. As Spider-Man and Venom fight the symbiote- controlled inmates, Venom had wished that Sentry was here to rip Carnage again. Spider-Man is then told by Venom that the Grendel symbiote has a weakness to electricity. Norman Osborn is freed from his cell as he attacks Spider-Man and Venom. Using an offshoot of the Grendel symbiote, Dark Carnage bonds it with Norman Osborn to recreate his Carnage form. =Issue 2= Dark Carnage has recreated Norman Osborn's Carnage appearance as he gloats that Knull will bring darkness and death to the universe. As Venom forms a wrecking ball to make a hole in the wall, Spider-Man wants to save Norman Osborn. Venom grabs Spider-Man as he carries him up the tower, creates dragon-like wings, and flies him away from Ravencroft. Dark Carnage tells Norman's Carnage form that there is nowhere that Spider-Man and Venom could escape to. After landing on a rooftop, Venom asks Spider-Man if they should go strolling up to Captain America and Wolverine, Spider-Man states that he would've handled them. After defeating Riot, Agony, Phage, and Lasher, Maker contacts Eddie and tells him that Dylan is fine. Maker informs Eddie about the grave that the Church of the New Darkness has made with the dead bodies. In addition, he also states that Anne Weying's body was never exhumed as he advises Venom to kill Dark Carnage before the situation gets worse. In his hideout beneath Grand Street, Dark Carnage is told by Norman's Carnage form that the murder pays in spades. Dark Carnage states to Norman's Carnage form that he is Cletus Kasady and not him. The hive is right now being amassed with Knull's powers. In SoHo, Manhattan, Miles Morales and Scorpion are fighting the Carnage Doppelgangers seeking to claim that Venom and Mania codex inside Scorpion. Venom catches up to them and advises Scorpion that they would set aside their grudge and save Miles. Venom throws him into the fray right into Norman's Carnage form. When he forms a blade to put into Scorpion's back, Miles uses his venom blast attack to fry part of the Carnage symbiote off of Norman's face enough for him to drop Scorpion. Venom has a horrified reaction when Miles is infected with a Grendel symbiote.Absolute Carnage #2. Marvel Comics. =Issue 3= Miles has been transformed into a six-armed Carnage Doppelganger. Lamenting that he wasn't able to rescue Miles, Venom fights him as Scorpion calls for help. Eddie and the Venom symbiote have a disagreement when it comes to the Venom symbiote wanting to have Norman Osborn killed after Venom mentioned Normie enough to briefly bring Norman to his senses. As the Grendel symbiote heals Norman, Venom brings Scorpion to the house of \\"Rex Strickland\\" since Scorpion would be in danger if he was sent back to prison. Venom finds that Spider-Man has called in Captain America, Thing, Wolverine, and Bruce Banner. As Captain America is handed Scorpion whose spine was broken in the attack, Venom is told that Maker fled when they showed up. As Venom gets fully acquainted with Bruce Banner, Dylan comes in where he has befriended a Sleeper symbiote that has bonded to a cat. Hours later, a storm rages as Bruce monitors the S.C.I.T.H.E. As Eddie is placed in a pod part of the S.C.I.T.H.E., the real Eddie Brock comes in and states his knowledge of Spider-Man being Peter Parker. It is then discovered that Eddie is actually Dark Carnage in disguise. When Spider-Man asks Bruce of Dark Carnage would break out, Bruce doubts it. Dark Carnage cracks through Captain America's pod as the Carnage Doppelgangers break into the building. The Venom symbiote leaves Eddie and engulfs Bruce Banner. As Dark Carnage stabs Bruce during the bonding process, he is transformed into a venomized version of Hulk whose punch nearly separates the Grendel symbiote from Cletus Kasady. It was also noted that the Venom symbiote couldn't cover all of Hulk as he introduces himself to Dark Carnage.Absolute Carnage #3. Marvel Comics. =Issue 4= While the Venomized Hulk fights Dark Carnage, Eddie Brock leads Spider-Man, Dylan Brock, and Normie Osborn to the door while assuring to Dylan that Sleeper can handle himself. Eddie asks Spider-Man to watch over Dylan while he gets the weapons that the Jury used on the Symbiotes. Eddie even equips himself with a Guardsman gauntlet and Captain America's shield. Eddie is then ambushed by the Carnage-possessed Miles Morales. Dark Carnage senses the power of the One Below All in Hulk where he plans to open it and paint it black like Knull's living abyss. When Dark Carnage tries to get the Venomized Hulk to side with him, Hulk punches Dark Carnage who sends tendrils into his head in order to mess with his mind. Using the cannon in the Guardsman gauntlet and charging Captain America's shield with it, Eddie Brock electrocutes the Symbiote on Miles enough to free him from its control. Afterward, Miles tells Eddie that he needs to get to the Venom Symbiote before Dark Carnage absorbs it and free Knull. Hulk regresses back to Bruce Banner and passes out just as Eddie and Miles arrive. Dark Carnage rips the Venom Symbiote off of Bruce as he assimilates it where he starts to grow horns, sharp spikes on his back, and black pauldrons and arm wraps similar to the ones on Knull. Captain America assures Eddie that he did all he can while punching a Carnage doppelganger. As Captain America takes back his shield, Thing and Wolverine arrive as the three of them charge towards Dark Carnage. Miles tells Eddie that the Carnage doppelgangers are attacking the S.C.I.T.H.E. and that Maker lied about destroying the Symbiote Codices. As Dark Carnage wipes the floor with Captain America, Thing, and Wolverine while Spider-Man fights the Carnage Norman Osborn, Eddie fights his way past the Carnage Doppelgangers to get to the S.C.I.T.H.E. Dark Carnage then turns his back spikes into wings as he plans to release Knull. Punching his hand into the S.C.I.T.H.E.'s container, Eddie becomes engulfed with the Symbiote Codices of Venom, Carnage, Riot, Agony, Lasher, Phage, Sleeper, Dreadface, Mania, Tyrannosaurus, and other unnamed Symbiotes which connects with the Venom Codex in his spine. While originally overwhelmed by the voices of the past Symbiote hosts, Eddie feels them melting together as the gestalt Symbiote transforms Eddie into a stronger, more focused version of Venom with powers of all the previous owners of the codices, not at one hundred percent though. Sprouting wings, Venom goes after Absolute Carnage and declares himself as the avenging fury of New York.Absolute Carnage #4. Marvel Comics. =Issue 5= The issue begins with a flashback of Eddie Brock first meeting Cletus Kasady in prison. In the present, while Eddie fights Dark Carnage, Cloak, Dagger, Iron Fist, Firestar, Morbius, Deathlok, Captain Marvel, Deadpool, and Scream arrive to help in the battle. Meanwhile, Spider-Man collapses during the fight with Norman, leading Dylan to somehow detonate him. Dark Carnage attacks Dylan, holding him hostage and reminding Eddie of his choice: to let his son die, and let Dark Carnage awaken Knull, or to kill Dark Carnage and take all of his codices, awakening Knull himself.

He engaged in various partnerships with his sons under the names of S. Kirk and Son and S. Kirk and Sons. In 1979 S. Kirk & Son was purchased by the Stieff Company, which renamed itself Kirk Stieff. Kirk was born in Doylestown, Pennsylvania, apprenticed in 1810 to James Howell in Philadelphia, and partnered from 1815-1820 with John Smith in Baltimore with their shop at 212 Market Street (later known as 106 Baltimore Street). On March 18, 1817, he married Albina Powell. He then worked from 1820-1826 in his own practice at 30 Baltimore Street, then from 1826-1830 at 140 Baltimore Street, and 1831-1846 at 144 Baltimore Street. During this early period Kirk introduced to America a chased floral repouss√© pattern for silverware, probably inspired by East India silversmiths, which is still known generically as \\"Baltimore Silver.\\" From 1846 onwards he partnered with his children: from 1846-1861 with Henry Child Kirk as S. KIRK & SON; from 1861-1868 with Henry Child, Charles Douglas, and Edwin Clarence Kirk as S. KIRK & SONS; from 1868-1870 with Henry Child Kirk as S. KIRK & SON; and again from 1870-1896 with Henry Child Kirk and Henry, Jr. as S. KIRK & SON (which continued after his death). The company was renamed S. Kirk & Son Inc. from 1924-1932, and then S. Kirk & Son STERLING from 1932 onwards. Kirk's work includes two silver cups for General Lafayette to commemorate his visit to Baltimore, President James Monroe's flatware service for his daughter's wedding, and a 48-piece dinner service for the USS Maryland that illustrates almost two hundred scenes from Maryland's history.

Tripe was born in London in 1821, one of 11 children born to Mary n√©e Broad (1795‚Äì1874) and Dr John Tripe (1789‚Äì1841). He was educated at the Merchant Taylor's School before studying medicine at the London Hospital, where he was awarded two gold medals. He became a Licentiate of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries (LSA) in 1843 before making further studies in medicine at the University of St Andrews from where he graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in 1846.

Tripe joined the Royal Meteorological Society as a young man; he was elected a Fellow in 1856, and served on the Council with a break of only a year from 1858 to his death in 1892. He held the office of President in 1871‚Äì72; of Vice-President in 1860‚Äì61, 1863‚Äì64, 1869‚Äì70; and of Secretary in 1865‚Äì66, 1868 and 1873‚Äì1892.

England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858‚Äì1995 for John William Tripe (1892) He is buried with his second wife and his son in Chingford Mount Cemetery. Obituary The grave of John William Tripe in Chingford Mount Cemetery Tripe's obituary was published in the British Medical Journal on 30 April 1892: \\"The career of Dr. Tripe, whose death at the age of 72 was announced in the British Medical Journal of 16 April, was so distinguished in its relation to the progress of hygiene that we feel it right to record some of his many claims to the esteem of the profession and the gratitude of those amongst whom he worked.Obituary for John William Tripe, MD ‚Äì British Medical Journal, 30 April 1892 pg. 941 On the passing of Sir Benjamin Hall's Act empowering the several districts of the metropolis to appoint medical officers of health, Dr. Tripe was elected for Hackney. This office he continued to hold during life. And it may be truly said that no district was better served than Hackney. He threw his soul and his energies into the task of improving the health of the population under his immediate charge. But his good work was far from being circumscribed by the narrow boundaries of a parish. As might be anticipated, the post of medical officer of health was eagerly sought after by many of the promising young men of the day looking for a start in life when the opportunity presented by Sir Benjamin Hall's Act arrived. Some of these, having fairly acquitted themselves in office, became absorbed in other-perhaps more lucrative work. Dr. Tripe was one of those who made sanitary science his more special study. He was one of the distinguished few whose labours justified the Act which created the office, and made public medicine what it is-an integral part of our internal administration. Letheby, Odling, and Tidy more especially demonstrated the applications of chemistry to hygiene. Simon, Seaton, Ballard, Buchanan, Dudfield, Corfield, and others have won reputation by the breadth of their work. No one more successfully than Tripe worked out the relations of meteorology and general science to this department of medicine. In the work of these and other men we see the best proof how a wise legislation may benefit the world by associating science with law. The beneficent action of medicine has been thus extended throughout all the relations of life. For thirty-six years Dr. Tripe held office. His annual reports to his vestry were conspicuous for clearness of insight into his duties, and the faithful, efficient, and temperate manner in which his advice was set forth. The esteem in which he was held by his brother medical officers was declared by electing him President of their Association. The ever-lamented Professor Parkes soon discovered his worth, and associated him in the work of the British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review. Under Parkes's editorship Tripe contributed valuable memoirs on 'Scarlatinal Dropsy and the Mortality from the Eruptive Fevers'; and, under Dr. Sieveking, he contributed a paper on 'The Relative Mortality of Males and Females under Five Years of Age', and one on 'Poisoning by Sausages'. Sir Edward Sieveking says of him: \\" I think all his articles would deserve reading at the present day, as they show much research and observation.\\" But, as we have already intimated, his great merit consisted in throwing the light of the allied science of meteorologymore especially on the problems of hygiene. He early in life joined the Royal Meteorological Society, and the part he played in it was no less honourable to himself than signal in its services to the Society. No one could be associated with him without being charmed with his manner-at once earnest and simple. His gentle wisdom and steadiness of purpose rarely failed to command the warm reception of his proposals. The Society was largely indebted to him for its prosperity; and this debt it was always ready to acknowledge. He was elected a Fellow in 1856, and served on the Council with only one year's intermission from 1858 to the time of his death. He held the office of President in 1871‚Äì72; of Vice-President in 1860‚Äì61, 1863‚Äì64, 1869‚Äì70; of Secretary in 1865‚Äì66, 1868, 1873‚Äì1892. He attended as Secretary not long before his death. He contributed to the Transactions of the Society: 'Some Observations on the Climate and Mortality of London in 1857, deduced from the Records of the Medical Officers of Health and the Returns of the Registrar-General'; (2) 'On the Meteorology and Mortality of 1858; (3) On the Medical Meteorology of the Metropolis during the Years 1859, 1860, and 1861'; (4) 'Presidential Addresses in 1872‚Äì73'; (5) 'On the Winter Climate of Some English Sea-side Health Resorts'; (6) 'On Some Relations of Meteorological Phenomena to Health'; (7) 'Ball Lightning Seen during a Thunderstorm on 11 July 1874'. The appreciation expressed by Sir Edward Sieveking of his other writings applies with equal force to these. The Society, at its general meeting held on 20 April, expressed its sense of the loss it had sustained in the following resolution, proposed by the President (Dr. Theodore Williams), and supported by Mr. Symons, F.R.S., his fellow Secretary; Mr. Marriott, Assistant Secretary; and Dr. Robert Barnes: > \\"The Council and Fellows of the Royal Meteorological Society have heard with > deep regret of the death of their esteemed Secretary, Dr. J. W. Tripe. Dr. > Tripe was an M.D. of St. Andrews, M.R.C.P. of Edinburgh, M.R.C.S. of > England. He was a student of the London Hospital. His scientific work had > received honourable recognition from the French Society of Hygiene, which > made him Foreign Associate; the Royal Society of Public Medicine of Belgium > also elected him Honorary Fellow. The resolution of the Meteorological > Society will be universally accepted as a just tribute to the memory of an > able, honest, and successful worker.

He served in various ministerial portfolios of the first republic including serving as Ghana's first Minister for Agriculture and the first Regional Minister for the Brong Ahafo Region. He also served as a member of parliament for the Sunyani East constituency. Early life and education Yeboah-Afari was born on 13 November 1920 to Nana Yeboah-Afari II son of a royal of the Dormaa Stool. He had his secondary education at Abuakwa State College completing in 1947. Career After his secondary education he returned to the Brong Ahafo Region to help revive the abandoned Dormaa Senior High School (then Dormaa State College) in Dormaa which was founded by one Mr. Oppong and one Mr. Yeboah who were both from Dormaa. He was made principal of the school by the founders when the first principal resigned upon threats from the British Colonial Government District Commissioner (DC) as the District Commissioner insisted the college's establishment was not part of the Government's development plan. Yeboah-Afari started the college again on 8 January 1948 with three students. He served as the school's principal, teacher, bursar and messenger. He developed close ties with Dr. Kwame Nkrumah (who was then the organising secretary of the United Gold Coast Convention) after forming a Dormaa Ahenkro branch of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) and served as a secretary of the branch. Dr. Kwame Nkrumah had founded the Ghana National College against the will of the then colonial government and when Nkrumah was in Kumasi, Yeboah-Afari met him to discuss the problems his school was facing with the colonial government and to suggest that Nkrumah takes responsibility for the school like he did for the Ghana National College. Politics Yeboah-Afari was a member of the Brong Kyempem Federation (BKF), which later changed into Brong Kyempem Council (BKC); a group that was founded for the progress of the Bono State. He replaced Nana Agyemang Badu I; the then omanhene (paramount chief) of Dormaa who had left for the United Kingdom for further studies at the University of Oxford. In 1951 he was elected as the first member of the legislative assembly representing Sunyani East on the ticket of the Convention People's Party. Five years later he was appointed Ghana's first Minister for Agriculture, he was then the youngest (aged 35) Minister in the Nkrumah government. In September 1956 he was appointed Minister for Communications and Works. During his tenure in office he helped establish the erstwhile Ghana Airways Corporation and the State Transport Corporation (STC). He was minister without portfolio in 1957. In June 1958 he was appointed Ministerial Secretary (deputy minister) for Western Ashanti, later that year when the Brong Ahafo Region was created he was appointed the Region's first Commissioner (Regional Minister). As the regional commissioner for the Brong Ahafo Region, he helped found the Sunyani Secondary School. His administration also helped in determining a location for the Sunyani Airport and the Military Barracks. He served as Brong Ahafo's regional commissioner until 1959 when he was replaced by Stephen Willie Yeboah. On 29 June 1962 he was sentenced to a term exceeding 12 months imprisonment making him incapable of representing the Sunyani East electoral area in parliament. Personal life and death He was the father of Ajoa Yeboah-Afari, a Ghanaian journalist. He died on 22 May 1996.

Life John Charles Duncan was the son of Daniel Davidson and Naomi, n√©e Jessup, Duncan. He graduated from Indiana University and received his Bachelor of Arts there in 1905. In 1905/1906, he received the first Lawrence Fellowship donated by Percival Lowell to students of Indiana University at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and participated in the photographic search for Trans- Neptunian planets. In the summer of 1912 he returned to the Lowell Observatory to help with the search. After receiving his Master of Arts in 1906, he began his doctoral studies at the University of California under the director of the Lick Observatory William Wallace Campbell, and in 1909 defended his dissertation on the Cepheids Y Sagittarii and RT Aurigae. Duncan was a lecturer at Harvard University from 1909 to 1916, and from 1911 until 1916 also at Radcliffe College, before he was appointed in 1916 the professor and director of the Astronomy Department of Wellesley College and director of the Whitin Observatory. After retiring in 1950, he spent the next twelve years as a visiting professor at the Steward Observatory. Much of his later work was closely linked to the Mount Wilson Observatory, which he visited for the first time in 1920‚Äì21, and where he spent the summers from 1922 to 1949 as a volunteer. There he took numerous photographs of galaxies and nebulae, explored the extent and filaments of the Crab Nebula, and discovered three variable stars in the Triangulum Nebula. His textbook on astronomy was republished several times, from the first edition in 1926 through the fifth edition in 1955, and an abridged 1947 edition. Duncan was a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and the American Astronomical Society (as Secretary of the later from 1936 to 1939), as well as a member of the International Astronomical Union, and since 1938 the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and numerous other scientific organizations. The asteroid 2753 Duncan, discovered on 18 February 1966 at the Goethe Link Observatory, was named after him. John Charles Duncan was married to Katharine Armington Bullard since 1906, with whom he had a daughter.

The problem is an important part of robot calibration, with efficiency and accuracy of the solutions determining the speed accuracy of the calibrations of robots. Methods Many different methods and solutions developed to solve the problem, broadly defined as either separable, simultaneous solutions. Each type of solution has specific advantages and disadvantages as well as formulations and applications to the problem. A common theme throughout all of the methods is the common use of quaternions to represent rotations. =Separable solutions= Given the equation , it is possible to decompose the equation into a purely rotational and translational part; methods utilizing this are referred to as separable methods. Where represents a 3√ó3 rotation matrix and a 3√ó1 translation vector, the equation can be broken into two parts:Amy Tabb, Khalil Yousef. \\"Solving the Robot-World Hand-Eye(s) Calibration Problem with Iterative Methods.\\" Machine Vision and Applications, August 2017, Volume 28, Issue 5-6, pp 569-590. : : The second equation becomes linear if is known. As such, the most frequent approach is to solve for and using the first equation, then using to solve for the variables in the second equation. Rotation is represented using quaternions, allowing for a linear solution to be found. While separable methods are useful, any error in the estimation for the rotation matrices is compounded when being applied to the translation vector.Mili Shah, et al. \\"An Overview of Robot-Sensor Calibration Methods for Evaluation of Perception Systems.\\" Other solutions avoid this problem. =Simultaneous solutions= Simultaneous solutions are based on solving for both and at the same time (rather than basing the solution of one part off of the other as in separable solutions), propagation of error is significantly reduced.Algo Li, et al. \\"Simultaneous robot-world and hand-eye calibration using dual-quaternions and Kronecker product.\\" International Journal of the Physical Sciences Vol. 5(10), pp. 1530-1536, 4 September 2010. By formulating the matrices as dual quaternions, it is possible to get a linear equation by which is solvable in a linear format. An alternative way applies the least-squares method to the Kronecker product of the matrices . As confirmed by experimental results, simultaneous solutions have less error than separable quaternion solutions. =Iterative solutions= Iterative solutions are another method used to solve the problem of error propagation. One example of an iterative solution is a program based on minimizing . As the program iterates, it will converge on a solution to independent to the initial robot orientation of . Solutions can also be two-step iterative processes, and like simultaneous solutions can also decompose the equations into dual quaternions.Zhiqiang Zhang, et al. \\"A computationally efficient method for hand‚Äìeye calibration.\\" 19 July 2017. However, while iterative solutions to the problem are generally simultaneous and accurate, they can be computationally taxing to carry out and may not always converge on the optimal solution. =The AX=XB case= The matrix equation , where is unknown, has an infinitive number of solutions that can be easily studied by a geometrical approach.

The village and all its land was from 1728 owned by Friederich Adeler. In 1756, he was granted royal permission to dissolve the village and merge all the land into a single manor. Adeler's father, Frederik Christian von Adeler, was a major landowner who had also served as amtmann of Roskilde, Tryggev√¶lde and finally Zealand. His grandfather was Cort Adeler. Henriette Margrethe von Barner Adeler had inherited the esta Egemarke after his father. In 1759, he was sent to Norway as amtmann. He then ceded Algestrup and Egem√¶rke to his son-in-law, Helmuth Gotthardt von Barner. A military officer, Barner reached the rank of lieutenant-colonel in 1756 and colonel in 1769. Berner's wife, Louise Christiane von Adeler, died just 28 years old in May 1759. He was later married second time with Henriette Margrethe von Lente- Adeler, a daughter of Theodor von Lente-Adeler ofLykkesholm and Leopoldine Cathrine J√∏rgensdatter Rosenkrantz. Sje kept the estate after her husband's death. In 1773, she ceded it to their son Theodor von Barner. =1809-1867: Changing owners= Johannes Schartau, a merchant from Copenhagen, purchased the estate in 1809. He was like many others hit by the economic crisis of the 1810s and in 1823 Algestrup was sold in a forced sale. The buyer was the crown and a new main building was subsequently built on the estate. In 1842, Algestrup was again sold in a public auction. The buyer was this time timber merchant Hans Hansen. In 1854, Algestrup was sold to Vilhelm Maag. =1867-present: Lemvigh family= Jacob Christian Henrik Lemvigh, the son of a parish priest in Krummestrup and Fuglebjerg, purchased Algestrup in 1867. He and his wife sband of Christine Sophie Steenbach had two children, Christian Henrik Lemvigh and Elisabeth Charlotte Lemvigh. Christian Henrik Lemvigh leased Holtegaard before acquiring Algistrup Manor in 1913. Elisabeth Charlotte Lemvigh took over Algestrup following her father's death in 1919. She left the estate to her niece, Edith Hedemann Lemvigh, who in turn left it to her nephew Ib Holger Lemvigh (1929-2015). He was succeeded by his son of the same name. A side wing was in 2019 hit by fire. Architecture The main building from 1834 is a white-washed, three-winged complex in a single storey. It has been adapted and extended in 1867, 1876 og 1884.

Career √ñstberg was born on 9 September 1897 in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of Axel √ñstberg, a bank clerk, and his wife Hilda (n√©e Eriksson). He enrolled as a cadet at the Royal Swedish Naval Academy in 1916. After sea expeditions on the armored cruiser and on the coastal defence ships and , he was commissioned as an officer in the Swedish Navy in 1919 with the rank of f√§nrik. He devoted himself to the naval artillery, and served on the coastal defence ships and , the torpedo cruiser HSwMS Claes Horn and the destroyer HSwMS Vidar and became a sub-lieutenant (l√∂jtnant) in 1922. He realized early on the necessity of modernizing the artillery fire control in order to take advantage of the tremendous development of firepower and range. In doing so, he utilized, among other things, the newly-established Eldledningsskolan (\\"Fire Control School\\"), which was built at H√•rsfj√§rden. Here he served during the mid-1920s, alternating with the completion of the Royal Swedish Naval Staff College's general course and staff course. √ñstberg's modern and practical experience of the artillery was utilized in the construction of the destroyers and in the late 1920s, which characterized a new type. He also gained insight into how, in the growing German Navy, utilized the experiences of World War I through his posting on a German destroyer in 1931. Since √ñstberg took up the position of artillery adjutant in the Highest Commander of the Coastal Fleet's staff in 1929, he was able to work effectively for his ideas about the naval artillery and combat service through realistic exercises. He remained in this position until 1934, when he was promoted to lieutenant (kapten). In the construction of the seaplane cruiser , his artillery knowledge was utilized, both during construction and his service as an artillery officer on board 1934-1936. √ñstberg's quick perception and determination made him fit and efficient as a staff officer. He served in the South Coast Naval District Staff in Karlskrona from 1936 to 1938, then as captain of the coastal defence ship HSwMS Dristigheten in 1938, and then as a staff officer in the Military Office of the Naval Defence (Sj√∂f√∂rsvarets kommandoexpedition) from 1938 to 1942. During this time he was also a teacher in the art of naval warfare at the Royal Swedish Army Staff College. √ñstberg was promoted to commander 2nd class (kommend√∂rkapten 2:a graden) in 1941 and served as captain of the coastal defence ship HSwMS Manligheten from 1941 to 1942. During the years 1942‚Äì1944, he was posted as a naval attach√© in Berlin and experienced the devastating bombings that the Allies deployed. √ñstberg was promoted to commander 1st class (kommend√∂rkapten 1:a graden) in 1943 and served as captain of the seaplane cruiser HSwMS Gotland from 1944 to 1945 when he was promoted to captain. In 1945, √ñstberg was appointed Inspector of the Naval Artillery. √ñstberg's previous posting in Berlin led him to become head of the Defence Staff's Section II in 1950. Also in 1950, he was appointed Vice Chief of the Defence Staff. During his time in the Defence Staff, he was also head of the school department of the mine cruiser and of the coastal defence ship . He was then posted to Washington, D.C. and Ottawa as naval attach√© from 1951 to 1954, where he could follow the arms race and contradictions between the great powers that followed the Korean War, which caused him serious concerns for Sweden. √ñstberg's final posting was as commanding officer of the West Coast Naval District (V√§stkustens marindistrikt) from 1954 to 1957. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1955. Later life √ñstberg never ceased during his long time as an old age pensioner to follow daily events in and around the Swedish Navy. He was badly affected by the abolition of heavy and medium-heavy artillery and the decommissioning of the coastal defence ships, cruisers and destroyers. He was severely tormented by the constant decline in the Swedish Navy's resources. The idea that one could not even prevent the entry and behavior of foreign submarines in the navy bases in H√•rsfj√§rden and in Karlskrona tormented and made him depressed. Personal life √ñstberg had two children from his first marriage, Kerstin (born 1923) and Marianne (born 1927). In 1933, √ñstberg married Marguerite Victoria Timen (born 1899), the daughter of Axel Timen and Olga Nelson. They had one daughter, Margareta (born 1936). √ñstberg died on 13 November 1984 in Lund and was buried on 8 October 1985 at Gal√§rvarvskyrkog√•rden in Stockholm.

She works on ways to mitigate volcanic risks, the interactions between rainfall and volcanic activity and the communication of volcanic hazards in the Caribbean. Barclay leads the NERC-ESRC funded Strengthening Resilience to Volcanic Hazards (STREVA) research project as well as a Leverhulme Trust programme looking at the volcanic history of the Ascension Islands.  Early life and education  Barclay became interested in the natural environment as a child, particularly volcanoes, tsunamis and avalanches. She enjoyed watching scientists from the Climatic Research Unit on BBC Horizon. Barclay studied geology at the University of Edinburgh. She moved to Bristol for her doctoral degree, and studied degassing processes in silicic volcanoes. During her postdoctoral fellowships she investigated magma storage in the Soufri√®re Hills volcano, an eruption which began on 18 July 1995. She identified that the Soufri√®re Hills magma contained amphibole, quartz, plagioclase, pyroxene, magnetite and ilmenite at pressures of 115 to 130 Megapascals. She worked at the University of California, Berkeley and University of Geneva, as well as serving as a duty scientist at the Montserrat Volcano Observatory.  Research and career  The Soufri√®re Hills volcano that Barclay has extensively studied. In 1999 Barclay was appointed to the University of East Anglia. Her research combines geological investigations into the dynamic processes of volcanoes with analysis of the social and cultural landscapes in which they erupt in. She served as Principal Investigator on Strengthening Resilience to Volcanic Hazards (STREVA), looking to develop a practical volcanic risk assessment framework, which was supported by the Natural Environment Research Council and Economic and Social Research Council. During STREVA Barclay worked with people from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines to document the historical and culture record of the 1902 and 1979 La Soufri√®re eruptions. As part of the programme, the researchers worked with the University of the West Indies to create a portable exhibit that toured the Caribbean. She combined historical archives, field measurements and meteorological modelling to reconstruct the La Soufri√®re eruptions. This allowed her to understand how the wind flow around volcanoes controls the movement of ash plumes through the atmosphere, depositing ash both close to the volcano and far away. In her work with communities in Ecuador Barclay showed that volcanic risk can be improved with collaborative monitoring. This work has inspired her latest project, Tomorrow‚Äôs Cities, which looks at urban disaster risk in cities including Quito. Barclay has argued that the deaths that occur due to pulses of gas and solids after a volcano are avoidable. = Public engagement = Alongside her research, Barclay is committed to outreach and public engagement. She focuses on communicating the relationships between the hazards and surface topographies; for example, when the difficult situations when land that is important to communities becomes too dangerous a place to live. STREVA resulted in a series of films that gave a voice to affected communities. In 2011 Barclay worked with Top Trumps to create a volcano themed version of the game. To create the game, Barclay consulted her colleagues to rank the thirty volcanoes for their explosiveness and deadliness. Barclay used the funds raised from Volcano Top Trumps to fund annual competitions to help people affected by volcanoes. They helped children in Ecuador make a book about volcano legends, the sales of which raised more money for the local community. She has created websites to communicate the relationship between hazards and landscape. She has appeared on the BBC, as well as speaking at Pint of Science, the Norwich Science Festival and the Natural History Museum. = Selected publications = Her publications include;   Personal life  Barclay is married with two children.

A chance find from what was to become the Chobonaino Site in Hakodate, Hokkaid≈ç, it is exhibited at the Hakodate J≈çmon Culture Center. it is one of five dog≈´ that have been designated National Treasures. The other four include \\"Dog≈´ with palms pressed together\\" from Aomori Prefecture, \\"J≈çmon Goddess\\" from Yamagata Prefecture, and \\"J≈çmon Venus\\" and \\"Masked Goddess\\" from Nagano Prefecture. It is also the first and, to date, only National Treasure in Hokkaid≈ç. Chobonaino Site The dog≈´ was unearthed in a field overlooking the Pacific Ocean on the east coast of the Oshima Peninsula in August 1975, by a housewife turning over the soil with a hoe to harvest potatoes. To provide contextual information, a trench was opened and a Late J≈çmon pit burial identified, complete with a jade pendant and fragments of a lacquered hairpin. In 2006, more detailed investigations were carried out over a wider area, uncovering further grave pits, refuse pits, lithics, and ceramics, as a well as a stone circle. On a terrace above Chobonaino, excavation of the Late J≈çmon has uncovered a series of contemporary pit dwellings. Description The figurine measures in height and in width, and weighs . Approximately a quarter the size of a human adult, it is the largest of its kind. Other than its missing arms and a hole either side of the top of the head, the dog≈´ is very well preserved. Over most of its surface, the figurine is covered with decoration of three kinds: ribbed bands, cord imprints, and circular impressions. Although one theory sees the figure as female, with well-defined nipples, a slightly swollen patterned belly indicating pregnancy, and linea nigra-like decoration running down her chest, the figure is generally viewed as male, with a stippled beard running from ear to ear and covering his chin and neck, and a hirsute lower abdomen. The \\"discord\\" in the \\"gender traits\\" may even \\"give the impression of a figure intended to transcend gender\\". The face is tilted slightly upwards and to the left, while the small protuberance on the top of the head may be a chignon. The single, continuous eyebrow, nose, and ears are defined by appliqu√© strips of clay. Beneath the mouth, two ribbed lines mark the transition from smooth skin to beard, while the beard is bounded below by a neck ring. Further ribbed strips of clay were applied to the back of the head, perhaps a fabric head-covering, upper chest and back, a cutoff top leaving the midriff bare, and legs, which are covered with a trouser-like garment, divided into horizontal fields, with flamboyant patterning. The knees are slightly bent, while between the lower legs there is a cross-piece with an opening. Traces of black lacquer on the beard and black and red pigment on the legs and elsewhere suggest that the figurine may once have been painted red and black all over. Researchers from the Hakodate City Museum took the dog≈´ to the municipal hospital for CT scanning, which helped cast light on the method of construction and on the interior, beyond what could be ascertained by shining a torch through the holes where the arms would be and on the top of the head. The torso is formed from slabs of clay, very thin on the back, with tubes of clay for the legs, and a finger-moulded head. The opening in the ornament between the legs connects with the rest of the hollow interior, and this has given rise to a number of different interpretations: it may have been inspired by contemporary pots with human figurative decoration and a spout where the foot would be; it may have been used in a funeral ritual relating to the burial context in which the figurine was found, the liquid-filled dog≈´ being tipped up by the officiant and its contents poured over the body of the deceased and into the open mouths of the celebrants; it may have been filled with smoke or some other aetherial vapour; or it may simply and solely have been a device that functioned to improve the circulation of air during firing, a similar technique being used later in the firing of haniwa. Recent history Discovered in 1975, the figurine was designated an Important Cultural Property in 1979. Since there was no suitable facility for display in the town of where the dog≈´ was discovered (now merged into Hakodate), the figurine was kept in a paulownia box nested within a safety deposit box in the vault of Minamikayabe Town Hall for thirty years, before more recent valorization. This has included an appeal for suggestions for a nickname, being chosen, a portmanteau combining the ËåÖ of Minamikayabe with the Á©∫ of hollow, the winning submission being awarded a year's supply of ma-konbu. Designated a National Treasure in 2007, the following year the figurine was specially exhibited at the 34th G8 summit, in a display case in the hotel in T≈çyako that provided the venue: the environment and climate change were one of the principal items on the agenda, and it was thought appropriate for there to be \\"a representative of the Jomon people who lived in harmony with nature\\". Subsequent exhibitions in which the figurine has featured include The Power of Dogu, at the British Museum in 2009, Dog≈´, a Cosmos, at the Miho Museum in 2012, and Jomon: 10,000 Years of Prehistoric Art in Japan, at Tokyo National Museum in 2018. Hollow Dog≈´ is now housed in room four of the Hakodate J≈çmon Culture Center, with lighting that evokes that of the moon and the environment of the J≈çmon period.

Johann Strauss, author of \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire: Translations of the Kanun-ƒ± Esasi and Other Official Texts into Minority Languages,\\" wrote that Nicolaides was \\"an extremely active but somewhat enigmatic figure in the press life of 19th century Istanbul.\\" Nicolaides was born and raised in Ottoman Constantinople (now Istanbul) and attended the Great National School (Megalƒì tou Genous scholƒì), a.k.a. the Phanar Greek Orthodox College; he graduated in 1861. His family was the Ieromnimons.Balta and Kavak, p. 33. Career He began editing the Anatolikos Astƒìr in 1862. In 1864 he left the first publication and began editing Heptalophos; he received ownership of it in 1865 and renamed it Nea Eptalofos. It became a newspaper in 1867, and it was renamed K≈çnstantinoupolis after that.Balta and Kavak, p. 36. During periods when K≈çnstantinoupolis was not in operation Nicolaides edited Thrakƒì (\\"Thrace\\"; August 1870-1880) and Avgi (\\"Aurora\\"; 6 July 1880-10 July 1884).Balta and Kavak, p. 37. He edited a French-language collection of Ottoman law, L√©gislation ottomane, that was published by Gregory Aristarchis. He also edited the Greek version of the D√ºstur, –ûŒ∏œâŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ ŒöœéŒ¥Œ∑Œ∫ŒµœÇ (\\"Oth≈çmanikoi k≈çdƒìkes\\", meaning \\"Ottoman Codes\\", with Demotic Greek using \\"ŒüŒ∏œâŒºŒ±ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒøŒØ Œ∫œéŒ¥ŒπŒ∫ŒµœÇ\\"), its first non-Turkish version. These two publications enriched him financially, giving him money used to operate his newspapers.Balta and Kevak, p. 40 After the Ottoman government received the Greek version, it made him a third-class civil servant. Nicolaides also wrote a document stating that he translated volumes of the Dust√ºr and the Mecelle into Bulgarian.Balta and Kavak, p. 51-52. The Bulgarian copies of the Dust√ºr circulating stated that they were written by Christo S. Arnaudov (; Post-1945 spelling: –•—Ä–∏—Å—Ç–æ –°. –ê—Ä–Ω–∞—É–¥–æ–≤), who published it.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 31 (PDF p. 33) Johann Straus concluded that the Bulgarian version likely originated from Nicolaides's Greek version due to \\"striking similarities\\" between the two, even though the Bulgarian one states that it was a collaborative work that was directly translated from Ottoman Turkish. A Konstantinoupolis employee, Manuel Gedeon, wrote that Nicolaides, Christoforos Samartzidis, and a person Gedeon described as \\"another impostor\\" together published a French version of Pharos of the Bosphorus (or Lighthouse of the Bosphorus).Balta and Kavak, p. 38. Gedeon stated that Nicolaides obtained 5,000 gold francs from the Ambassador of Russia to the Ottoman Empire, Ignatieff, to fund this publication, and that he did not give much of this away to other parties. According to Gedeon, Theodoros Kasapis wrote in Diogenis that the Russian ambassador had bribed Nicolaides. Nicolaides also applied to make his own Karamanli Turkish publication, Asya, but was denied. Evangelina Baltia and Ay»ôe Kavak, authors of \\"Publisher of the newspaper Konstantinoupolis for half a century,\\" wrote that they could find no information explaining why Nicolaides' proposal was turned down.Balta and Kavak, p. 42 Ultimately in 1889 he established an Ottoman Turkish newspaper, Servet. Servet-i F√ºn√ªn was originally a supplement of Servet.Strauss, \\"A Constitution for a Multilingual Empire,\\" p. 29 (PDF p. 31). For a period his main printing facility was at Millet Han in Galata. He applied to move to a new facility on two occasions, to Financƒ±lar Yoku»ôu in 1899, approved but not completed, and then to Lloyd Han in 1902, also approved.Balta and Kavak, p. 48. The move was completed by 1903.Balta and Kavak, p. 49. Because Nicolaidis tried to save his newspapers no matter what it took, he sold his possessions and lost his wealth. Life and death He had a wife, Sevastitsa; two sons, Nikolakis \\"Nikos\\" and Georgakis;Balta and Kavak, p. 55. and a daughter, who married in 1892. He invited Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdulhamid II to his daughter's wedding; Balta and Kavak stated that this illustrated the close relationship between the Ottoman government and Nicolaides.Balta and Kavak, p. 54. He himself was in favour of Ottomanism.Balta and Kavak, p. 57. According to Gedeon, Nicolaides had a house in Phanar (now Fener), one in Mouchli, and one in Antigone (now Burgazada) in the Prince's Islands.Balta and Kavak, p. 39. An 1894 earthquake ruined the Mouchli house. In 1915 Nicolaides died a poor man, and his children were not present as they were in different places. Rum Millet community members living in Pera (Beyoƒülu) and friends bankrolled his funeral, which was officiated by the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, Germanus V. Awards Nicolaides received medals: the √úc√ºnc√º R√ºtbe'den Mecid√Æ ni≈üani; after requesting so from the Ottoman government, the Serbian √úc√ºnc√º R√ºtbe'den Takova ni≈üani, a third degree award; and then second and first degree medals, Saniye R√ºtbesi and M√ºtemayize R√ºtbesi, the last in 1893.Balta and Kavak, p. 53.

Life  Qiu Zhu was born in Taicang County, Suzhou Prefecture, the daughter of Qiu Ying (1494? ‚Äì 1552), one of the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty. Little is known about her life, and it is assumed that she learned to paint from her father. She was possibly married to You Qiu (), an artist influenced by her father and generally believed to be his son-in-law, although this has been questioned by some scholars. In his later life Qiu Ying lived at the estate of his patron, collector , and she might have also lived there. She maintained a close relationship with the Xiang family after her father's death, and at least one of her extant works bears the seal of a Xiang family member.  Work  Painting of women playing musical instruments, collection of the Palace Museum, Beijing Qiu Zhu was active as an artist from around 1565 to 1585. She was commissioned to produce paintings for birthday gifts, or to complement calligraphy. She was also commissioned to create illustrations for Wang Chong's calligraphy of the narrative poem Nymph of the Luo River. This suggests her work was well received, as Wang was held in high esteem. A later Ming dynasty scholar considered Qiu Zhu to be a \\"Li Gonglin among women\\". Li Gonglin was a highly regarded artist in his time. Qiu Zhu is noted for her use of firm brushstrokes and delicate drawing. Qiu Zhu's most famous subject is Guanyin, the bodhisattva of compassion especially appealing to women, and her paintings of the goddess have been described as \\"mysteriously transcendent\\". The 24 portraits of Guanyin are presented in an album alternating them with short text passages. They are in gold ink on black paper, and were inspired by an album of woodblock prints by Ding Yunpeng (1547‚Äì1628) that had been based on a hand scroll by Li Gonglin. Her acclaimed painting, White Robed Guanyin, is in the collection of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. She also painted other religious figures, such as her fan painting of A Daoist Female Immortal, possibly Chang E. Her non-religious subjects are primarily women at leisure: playing xiangqi under plum blossoms, playing a guqin under wutong trees, sitting at a writing desk, or playing with a parrot. She also painted women celebrating the Double Seven Festival which is a festival honouring the Weaver Maid, the patron spirit of women's work. Qiu Zhu was considered a highly refined painter, and is seen to have influenced Wen Shu.

The islands are important to migratory sea birds, and are also of interest to tourists. The management plan was prepared in 2008. Location The Sept √éles Archipelago protects the mouth of the Sept √éles Bay on the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence about east of Baie- Comeau and west of Havre-Saint-Pierre. It is just north of the 50th parallel in Sept-√éles, in the Sept-Rivi√®res Regional County Municipality of Quebec. The bay lies between the Marconi peninsula to the west and Pointe aux Basques to the east. The islands are Petite Boule, Grosse Boule, Grande Basque, Petite Basque, √Æle du Corossol, √Æle Manowin and the √Ælets De Quen. The city of Sept- √éles, just north of the islands, has 73% of the population of Sept-Rivi√®res, with 26,000 inhabitants in 2008. 10% of the people work directly in the mining, fishing and logging industries, and many of the other jobs are created by the role of the city as a supply and service center for the northern mining towns and the villages of the lower north shore. The Sept-√éles Tourism Corporation manages the recreational and tourist activities in the archipelago. The corporation manages the ferry to the Grande Basque island, and cruises around the islands. Environment A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the archipelago as lying in ecological sub-region 5g-T Hautes collines de Baie-Comeau‚àíSept-√éles, within the eastern fir/white birch domain of the boreal zone. The Sept √éles archipelago is part of the Sept-√éles IBA, an Important Bird Area. The IBA covers an area of including part of the City of Sept-√éles, the bay and its coastline, the archipelago and the Checkley plain. Corossol Island is designated a Migratory Bird Sanctuary and has a conservation plan. During the nesting season large numbers of seabirds invade the √éle du Corossol, including the common eider. The main reason for making the island a refuge was to protect this species. Other common species include double-crested cormorant, great black-backed gull, herring gull, little penguin, black guillemot, Leach's storm petrel, black guillemot and black- legged kittiwake. Species such as great black-backed gulls and herring gulls are in decline. An increase in recreational boating has disrupted the bird fauna in the archipelago, including causing the common eider to temporarily abandon their nestlings, which are then vulnerable to gulls. Starting in the fall of 2013 a project led the L'Institut nordique de recherche en environnement et en sant√© au travail (Inrest) began to gather data on the physicochemical quality of water and sediments of the bay and islands, and to analyze the results to identify potential impacts on ecosystem health. The Saint Lawrence Global Observatory (OGSL) and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (ISMER) of the Universit√© du Qu√©bec √† Rimouski participated. History The Sept-Rivi√®res Regional County Municipality (MRC) declared in October 2005 that it intended to create a regional park in the Sept-√éles archipelago. The project was the result of over 25 years of recreational and tourist development, creating pressure to establish a legal framework to protect this valuable natural asset. Factors were conservation of sensitive ecosystems and retaining visitors to the area. A multidisciplinary working committee was set up in 2006 to work with the Regional County Municipality in creating guidelines for developing and managing the proposed regional park. The committee had eight members, consisting of a council member and technical representative of Port-Cartier and of Sept-√éles, and representatives of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the Quebec Department of Natural Resources and Wildlife, Tourisme Sept-√éles and the C√¥te-Nord Regional Environmental Council. The overall objective was to ensure sustainable development of the archipelago. In February 2008 it was reported that the MRC had decided on the boundaries of the proposed park, which would cover of the archipelago, including a boundary around the islands. Almost all the land was public property, so no expropriation would be involved. The Innu of Uashat- Maliotenam were to be consulted. The Grande-Basque Island, holding facilities of the IOC mining company, would be excluded from the park. The MRC recommended that the city of Sept-√éles should not accept any new commercial projects on the islands. The committee was to present its development and management plan to the Ministry of Municipal and Regional Affairs later that year.

Elvire de Greef, (b. June 29, 1897, Ixelles, Belgium, d. August 20, 1991, Brussels), code name Tante Go or Auntie Go, was a member of the Comet Escape Line in World War II. From her house in Anglet in southwestern France, near the border with Spain, she led efforts by the Comet Line in the Basque country to exfiltrate people from occupied Belgium through France to Spain, especially Allied airmen whose aircraft had been shot down by Nazi Germany. Once across the border in neutral Spain the escapees were transported to the United Kingdom. Her husband and two teenage children were also involved in the Comet line. De Greef was a recipient of the George Medal from the United Kingdom and the Medal of Freedom from the United States. Background Born Elvire Ghislaine Berlemont, she married Fernand de Greef (born November 11, 1902) in 1922. The couple had two children: Frederick, born in 1923, and Janine (born September 29, 1925). In May 1940, when the German army invaded and occupied Belgium, the de Greef family and an Englishman named Albert Edward Johnson fled in an attempt to transit Spain and take refuge in the United Kingdom. Finding the border with Spain closed, they moved into a vacant house in Anglet, a town in the Basque Country of southwestern France about from the border with Spain. Johnson, code named \\"B\\", formerly a chauffeur in Belgium, lived with the de Greefs, aiding them as a handyman. Johnson and the de Greef children would later serve as couriers and guides for airmen attempting to escape to Spain.Ottis, Sherri Greene (2015), Silent Heroes: Downed Airmen and the French Underground, Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, p. 121 Their house, the \\"Villa Voisin,\\" was less than from the house where the German military commander lived.\\"Comete Pays Basque,\\" , accessed 18 Sep 2019 When the Germans occupied the area in June 1940, Fernand got a job with the city government. As a translator and interpreter for the French with the German army, he had the opportunity to gather intelligence and steal and falsify documents, stamps, and identification cards and was assisted by his son, Frederick. Elvire became involved in the black market and smuggling, a time-honored occupation of people on the Franco-Spanish border. The German occupiers were among her customers, relationships which she would rely on later. Her well-known black marketing activities gave her an excuse to be seen at odd times and odd places. Before leaving Brussels, Elvire had let it be known to a banker named Appert (or Apper) that she wanted to be involved in the resistance to the Germans.Ottis, p. 121 They agreed that a person sent by Appert to seek help from the de Greef's would present him or herself with the password of \\"Is Go dead?\\" Gogo was the name of a deceased pet dog of the de Greef's. The Comet Line In 1941, Andree de Jongh was a 24-year-old Belgian woman who, along with a 32-year-old Belgian man, Arnold Deppe, was attempting to set up what became known as the Comet Line (\\"Reseau Comete\\"). In June, Depp√© journeyed from Belgium to southwestern France where he had once lived to look for the means to smuggle allied soldiers, downed airmen, and other people vulnerable to capture by the Germans out of Belgium.Ottis, p. 121. On Appert's advice, Depp√© made contact with the de Greef family and arranged for their help in getting people across the border. Later, on first meeting Elvire, de Jongh jokingly called her \\"aunt\\" and thus Elvire combined aunt with the name of her deceased dog and became \\"Tante Go\\" (\\"Auntie Go\\").Langthorne, Mark and Richards, Matt (2018), The Hidden Army - M19's Secret Force and the Untold Story of D-Day, London: King's Row Publishing, np.\\"The Beginning of Comete,\\" , accessed 16 Sep 2019 Her husband Fernand's code name was \\"Uncle.\\"\\"Andree de Jongh,\\" , accessed 17 Sep 2019. Andree de Jongh and Arnold Depp√©, assisted by the de Greefs, attempted their first crossing of the Spanish border in July 1941 with 10 Belgians and \\"Miss Richards,\\" supposedly an English woman but actually a Belgian secret agent named Frederique Dupuich. After they successfully crossed the border, de Jongh and Depp√© left their charges to fend for themselves, and returned to Belgium. The 10 Belgians and \\"Miss Richards\\" were arrested by Spanish police. Three Belgian soldiers among them were turned over to the Germans in France. The others were jailed briefly and fined. From this experience, de Jongh realized that in future exfiltrations they must accompany their charges secretly all the way to the British Consulate in Bilbao.\\"WWII escape and evasion,\\" , accessed 16 Aug 2019\\"Comete,\\" , accessed 16 Aug 2019 In August, Depp√© and de Jongh escorted another group of people, de Jongh taking a longer, more rural, and safer route with three men, including a British soldier, and Depp√© a shorter, more dangerous route with six men.

Depp√© was imprisoned for the remainder of the war.\\"Liste des personnes ayant aid√© des aviateurs pass√©s par Com√®te,\\" . accessed 17 Sep 2019 De Jongh arrived safely at the de Greef house in Anglet and crossed into Spain with a Basque smuggler, Thomas Anabitarte, as a guide. Anabitarte had been hired by Elvire for his knowledge of the mountainous border region. De Jongh and her charges arrived safely at the British Consulate in Bilbao. She persuaded the British government to pay the Comet Line's expenses for transporting allied soldiers and airmen from Belgium to Spain, but declined all other assistance and guidance offered by the British.Ottis, pp. 121-122 Leader of the southern Comet Line Elvire de Greef was the leader of the southern section of the Comet Line. Her helpers included the three members of her family, about a dozen other key people who lived in neighboring cities and towns plus a number of sympathizers, and several Basque guides who were paid for leading escapees over the mountains into Spain. She also had helpers inside Spain who received the escapees and assisted their onward journey to San Sebastian and Bilbao.Jimenez de Aberasturi Corta, Juan Carlos (2011), \\"Le red 'Com√®te' en el Pais Vasco,\\" Rev. int. estud. vascos, Vol. 56, No. 2, pp. 543-549,, accessed 18 Sep 2019 In three years of activity de Greef aided 101 exfiltration missions which successfully exfiltrated 288 airmen, mainly British and American, and 84 other persons, mostly Belgians, needing to escape occupied Europe.\\"Chronologies of the Passages,\\" . accessed 18 Sep 2019\\"Liste de personnes aidees par la ligna Com√®te,\\" , accessed 18 Sep 2019 The allies put a high priority on recovering airmen shot down in Europe and returning them to service as it was time- consuming and expensive to train replacement aircrew. De Greef also supervised the finances of the southern section, accounting for the expenditure of 17 million French Francs (equivalent to 5 million in 2017 U.S. dollars). Most of the money came from the United Kingdom.Verstraeten, Peter and Lippens, Willy (Mar-Apr 2010), \\"The George Medal Awarded to Belgians,\\" JOMSA,\\" Vol. 61, No. 2, pp 36-37 One of de Greefs most important helpers was a Basque widow, Kattalin Aguirre, who along with her 14 year old daughter, Josephine (\\"Fifine\\"), provided a safe house for airmen after they got off the train in Saint-Jean-de-Luz and set them on their way toward the nearby border. The Euskalduna Hotel where Aguirre worked was a meeting place for smugglers and Comet Line helpers.

Downloaded from JSTOR.\\"Comete Line\\", http://www.cometeline.org/ABChelpers.html, accessed 18 Nov 2019 Crossing the border The usual practice of the Comet Line was for airmen and other evacuees to travel by train from Brussels or Paris with an escort, often Andree de Jongh, to either Bayonne or Saint-Jean-de-Luz. Both cities were near the de Greef's home. The airmen and their escort were met and conducted to a safe house where they would await favorable conditions for the walk to Spain over the Pyrenees mountains which reached elevations of only about in this region. During the first year of operation, the de Greef's home usually hosted the evacuees, but later a network of safe houses was established. From the safe houses, the evacuees were escorted to country homes and inns near Urrugne, usually traveling by bicycle. From Urrugne it was a one to three night hike of about with a Basque guide, usually one who had been a smuggler and knew the mountains intimately, across the Franco-Spanish border to Oiartzun, near San Sebastian.\\"The Comet Escape Line,\\" , accessed 18 Sep 2019\\"The World War II Comet Line\\", https://www.pyreneanexperience.com/comet- line/], accessed 18 Sep 2019 There, the evacuees were met by a driver and automobile belonging to British diplomats which took them to Madrid. From Madrid, the evacuees were escorted by British diplomats to Gibraltar from where they would be flown to the United Kingdom.Watt, George (1990), The Comet Connection: Escape from Hitler's Europe, Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, pp. 99-100 The most dangerous part of the walk across the mountains was the crossing of the Bidassoa river near Endarlatsa. The Bidassoa River was the border of France and Spain. Border guards were on both sides of the river and high water often made the crossing of the river difficult or impossible. In December 1943, Comet Line leader Antoine d‚ÄôUrsel and American pilot James F. Burch were drowned while attempting to cross the river.\\"The Comet Escape Line\\", Elvire crossed the border four times to convey intelligence about the Germans to the British in Bilbao.Verstraeten and Lippens, p. 36 Her daughter Janine, only 16 years old, made four visits to Paris in 1942 to assist Andree de Jongh in escorting evacuees from Paris by train to the border of Spain.\\"Alphabetical list of helpers,\\" , accessed 18 Sep 2019 The de Greef's \\"handyman,\\" Albert Johnson, \\"B\\", escorted 13 groups of escapees across the border into Spain from 1942 to 1944.

On June 6, 1944 with the German Gestapo closing in on the de Greef's and their organization, Elvire and her son and daughter crossed the border into Spain. The children were evacuated to England. Elvire returned to France shortly.\\"Chronologies of the Passages,\\" . accessed 18 Sep 2019 Elvire and her husband Fernand participated in a rescue mission. Although movement of airmen across the Franco-Spanish border had mostly ceased with the D-Day invasion of France on June 6, 1944, the Basque guide Florentino Goikoetxea continued to cross the border to deliver messages to British authorities in San Sebastian, Spain. Returning from a mission on July 26, he was shot four times by German border guards although he managed to hide the documents he was carrying. He was taken to a hospital in Bayonne. The local resistance forces and the de Greefs decided to rescue him. On July 27, Elvire visited him the hospital and told him a rescue would be attempted. Later that day two German- speaking Bayonne policemen working with the resistance showed up at the hospital in an ambulance driven by Fernand. They pretended to be Gestapo agents, and demanded to take Florentino (as he was universally known) with them. They put him in the ambulance and drove away. Florentino remained in hiding until the Nazis abandoned southwestern France a month later.Jimenez de Aberasturi Corta, pp. 562-563Verstraeten, Peter and Lippens, Willy (Mar-Apr 2010), \\"The George Medal Awarded to Belgians,\\" JOMSA,\\" Vol. 61, No. 2, pp 36-37 The de Greef family returned to Belgium after the country was liberated from the Nazis.\\"Chronologie des Passages,\\" , accessed 18 Sep 2019 References Category:1897 births Category:1991 deaths Category:Belgian resistance members Category:Recipients of the George Medal Category:Women in World War II Category:Recipients of the Medal of Freedom Category:Belgian people of World War II Category:Belgian recipients of the George Medal Category:Female resistance members of World War II ","title":"Elvire de Greef"},{"id":"61796427","text":"Gary Wayne Kielhofner (February 15, 1949 ‚Äì September 2, 2010) was an American social scientist and influential occupational therapy theorist who rose to prominence as a scholar during his time as Professor and Wade-Meyer Chair of the Department of Occupational Therapy at the University of Illinois at Chicago. He is best known for his conceptual practice model, which is known globally as The Model of Human Occupation (MOHO). The model was first published as a series of articles in The American Journal of Occupational Therapy by Kielhofner and others but later extensively developed over Kielhofner's career and disseminated in numerous books and articles. Kielhofner lectured widely and consulted regularly in the United States and abroad, particularly throughout Scandinavia, the United Kingdom, (including Scotland), Ireland, Italy, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Japan, Hong Kong, Israel, and Central and South America. An active network of proponents across the international occupational therapy community continues to study and evolve his model through the MOHO Clearinghouse maintained at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). Kielhofner's main theoretical contribution was his idea that a complete understanding of the complex manner through which human occupation is initiated, pursued and completed necessarily requires systems approaches that rely upon research in the biological, psychological and social sciences. He was among the first theorists in his field to use general systems theory and later dynamical systems theory to describe the complexities of his model, which described the iterative, interactive relationships between a person's volition, habituation (roles and habits), performance capacity, and the social and physical environment. He was also the first theorist to clearly explain the importance and relevance of the temporal dimension to occupational therapy practice. Kielhofner's work is widely cited and his model stands among the most influential theoretical contributions in the history of occupational therapy. Personal life and education Gary Wayne Koehofner was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri on February 15, 1949 and lived in rural SE Missouri (Oran) during his boyhood. His early schooling was in nearby Chaffee, Missouri at St. Ambrose School in the Catholic parish of the same name. As a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, he attended seminary before studying psychology and occupational therapy at St. Louis University. Profoundy influenced by an early experience as a very young child helping his Grandmother following a severe car accident, he decided to continue study in occupational therapy at the University of Southern California (USC), where he quickly became interested in the theoretical foundations of the profession. During his time as a graduate student at USC, he worked on a theoretical model to better understand human agency and its consequences and influences from a health perspective, publishing four articles that articulated his theory. These articles attempted to draw from and apply leading ideas from the social sciences into a complex understanding of humans as beings with an intrinsic need to act competently and meaningfully on their environments. Upon graduation from USC with a Master of Arts degree in Occupational Therapy, Kielhofner decided to begin advanced study in public health, later earning the Dr.P.H. (Doctor of Public Health) degree from the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). Career Upon graduation from UCLA, Kielhofner accepted an appointment at Boston University, soon thereafter to accept a position at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). While at VCU, he began earnestly to further develop and explain his Model of Human Occupation, which was then starting to gain attention in the profession of occupational therapy. In 1988 he accepted an appointment as Professor, Wade-Meyer Chair, and Head at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he remained until his death in 2010. During his stay at Chicago, Kielhofner continued the development of his theory, publishing numerous articles that explicated various components of the model. As recognition of the model grew, he accepted invitations to lecture and teach at several international locations where his work was influential in guiding practice, most notably in Stockholm, Sweden at the Karolinska Institute and at Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, Scotland. He established the Center for Outcomes Research and Education at UIC under a grant from the American Occupational Therapy Foundation, which later inducted him into its Academy of Research. Shortly before his death, he began an international symposium that continues and started a clearinghouse of articles and publications at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In recognition of his work, Kielhofner received honorary doctorates from the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Queen Margaret University in Scotland, and the University of Link√∂ping, Sweden. In 2017, during occupational therapy's centennial, Kielhofner was honored through his listing among 100 influential occupational therapists in occupational therapy's history by the American Occupational Therapy Association.

Social life  Friedrich Kleinw√§chter was born in the multiethnic Prag of the times of the imperial Austria-Hungary. His family was German, living next to Czechs, Jews and others. Kleinw√§chter worked and died in Czernowitz/Bukovina, which was even more multiethnic (Jews, Germans, Romanians, Ukrainians and Polish) and became Romanian since 1919. In 1909, Kleinw√§chter had been ennobled and was authorized to use the prefix ‚Äúvon‚Äù before ‚ÄúKleinw√§chter‚Äù.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels 91: Adelslexikon, Band VI, Limburg an der Lahn 1987, S. 269  Professional life  In 1865, Friedrich Kleinw√§chter habilitated in Prag, whereupon he became an ordinary professor at the Technical University Riga in Riga/Russia and since 1875 until his emeritation he was ordinary professor of political economics (Ordinarius f√ºr Staatswissenschaften) at the newly established \\"Franz-Josephs-Universit√§t\\" at Czernowitz. There he lectured finance in combination with financial law and public administration. Later he switched to economics in general.Erk Volkmar Heyen: Wissenschaft und Recht der Verwaltung seit dem Ancien R√©gime. Klostermann. Frankfurt/M. 1984. 1882/83 and 1893/94 Kleinw√§chter was Rektor of the university of Czernowitz.Rektoratsreden (HKM) Kleinw√§chter published several text books, and furthermore many articles in the periodical Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr National√∂konomie und Statistik. 1882‚Äì1902 he was editor of the German- speaking Genossenschaftszeitung (journal of cooperatives) for the Bukovina destrict in the very Northeast of Austria-Hungary. His son was the diplomat Ludwig Kleinw√§chter,. his nephew the lawyer Friedrich F.G. Kleinw√§chter.  Scientific achievements  In 1883 Kleinw√§chter presented the first scientific analysis on economic cartels. His judgement of them was positive similar of that on the guilds of the premodern times. According to him, the cartels could regulate the anarchism in the economic life (\\"Anarchismus in der Volkswirtschaft\\"), which came from the vigorous competition of the liberal economic system of Kleinw√§chter's life time. He defined types of cartels, namely production, sales and price cartels. To them, he also put some kinds of agreements between employers.Richter, Klaus W.: Die Wirkungsgeschichte des deutschen Kartellrechts vor 1914 Mohr Siebeck. T√ºbingen. 2007. In the dispute with the social movements of industrialization, Kleinw√§chter conceded that the scientific socialism had contributed much to the discussion of the social issue. But that was almost its main achievement, because the further economic theses of the socialists were more or less wrong.Article in Neue Zeit 4 (1886, 240): Die Grundlagen und Ziele des sogenannten wissenschaftlichen Sozialismus. Innsbruck 1885. In the English speaking world, Kleinw√§chter is to some extent known because of the so-called Kleinwachter's conundrum on income tax. The conundrum was popularized by Henry Simons, who mentioned it in his tax treatise, Personal Income Taxation.See \\"Kleinwachter's Conundrum\\" in Simons, Personal Income Taxation (1938) at p. 53 In illustrating this point, Simons referred to this one of several hypotheticals posed by Kleinw√§chter.For a translation of Kleinw√§chter's discussion, see Friedrich Kleinw√§chter, Das Einkommen und seine Verteilung (Leipzig: C.L.

He ruled Sparta from 445 BC to 426 BC and again from 408 BC to 395 BC. Early life Pausanias took his first reign while still a minor, during a time of political unrest. Around 446 BC, Euboea and Megara rebelled against the Athenian empire and the Peloponnesian forces under the command of Pleistonax invaded Attica (Athens) going as far as Eleusis and Thria. His father Pleistoanax was temporarily deposed and exiled after being charged by the Spartans with taking a bribe, probably from the Athenian leader, Pericles, to withdraw from the plain of Eleusis in Attica. Pausanias took the throne in 445 BC and ruled until 426 BC, when his father was recalled and restored as Agiad King of Sparta. Pleistoanax held this role until his death in 409 BC. In c. 408 BC, Pausanias once again became the Agiad King of Sparta. Peloponnesian War Following the Spartan victory over Athens in the Battle of Aegospotami in 405 BC, the Spartans were in a position to finally force Athens to capitulate. Pausanias laid siege to Athens' main city while the Spartan admiral Lysander's fleet blockaded the port of Piraeus. This action effectively closed the grain route to Athens through the Hellespont, thereby starving Athens. Realising the seriousness of the situation, the Athenian statesman, Theramenes, started negotiations with Lysander. These negotiations took three months, but in the end Lysander agreed to terms at Piraeus. With the capitulation of Athens the Peloponnesian War ended in 404 BC. Lysander then put in place a puppet government in Athens with the establishment of the oligarchy of the Thirty Tyrants under Critias which included Theramenes as a leading member. However, in 403 BC Pausanias was able to undermine Lysander's dominance of Athens after Pausanias gained the command of the Peloponnesian League expedition against the Athenian democrats then based in Piraeus. Despite opposition from Lysander, Pausanias took the opportunity to promote a reconciliation between the democratic party in Piraeus and the oligarchs controlling Athens' main city, thus allowing the re- establishment of democratic government in Athens. Pausanias was able to restore democracy in Athens while bringing the Athenians, temporarily, into an alliance with Sparta. Pausanias's actions led to a major conflict with the Spartan ephors. Pausanias was prosecuted, but then acquitted. Corinthian War Returning to Sparta in 395 BC, Lysander was instrumental in starting a war with Thebes and other Greek cities, which came to be known as the Corinthian War. The Spartans prepared to send out an army against this new alliance of Athens, Thebes, Corinth and Argos (with the backing of the Persians). The Spartans arranged for two armies, one under Lysander and the other under Pausanias, to rendezvous at and attack the city of Haliartus, Boeotia. Lysander arrived at the city while Pausanias's forces were still several days away. Not willing to wait for Pausanias, Lysander advanced to Haliartus with his troops. In the ensuing Battle of Haliartus, Lysander was killed after bringing his forces too near the walls of the city. Pausanias's army arrived after Lysander's defeat but then left the battle scene primarily due to Athenian military opposition. King Pausanias negotiated a cease of fighting so the bodies of the dead were able to be collected for a proper burial. After, the Spartan army returned to Sparta. Because of his poor leadership at Haliartus, Pausanias was condemned to death by the Spartans and replaced as king by his young son Agesipolis I. However, Pausanias was able to escape execution and fled Sparta to live in exile in Tegea. Exile While living in Tegea, Pausanias wrote a pamphlet. No fragments of the pamphlet have survived and its contents or purposes are not clear. However, it seems that he wrote the pamphlet to criticize his opponents in Sparta accusing them of violating traditional Spartan laws and advocating the abolition of the ephors. Pausanias is believed to have outlived his son, Agesipolis I, according to an inscription found on a monument set up by Pausanias to the memory of his son in Delphi. The year of Pausanias's death is sometime after 380 BC. He was also the father of Cleombrotus I.  References  * Plutarch, Lives. Life of Lysander.

Four city gates were built: North, East, South, and West. They were designated a California Historic Landmark (No.122) on March 29, 1933.California Parks, North gate of city of Anaheim An historic marker sits at the intersection of South Anaheim Boulevard and West South Street, at 777 South Anaheim Boulevard. The marker is to memorialize Anaheim's founding in 1857 and the city gate that was there. The early Anaheim Colony put up a barrier around the town to block out wild cattle grazing in nearby fields. The City of Los Angeles lay beyond the North gate, making it the most frequented. Pioneer house of the Mother Colony The Pioneer House of the Mother Colony or Anaheim first house was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.102) on June 20, 1935. The house was relocated to 414 North West Street, Anaheim in 1929 from the corner of Los Angeles Ave, now Anaheim Boulevard, and Cypress Streets. House was built in 1857 by the colony's founder, George Hanson, a Los Angeles surveyor, known as the \\"Father of Anaheim\\". The Mother Colony is the name given to the group of a German- Americans that departed San Francisco in 1857 to start farming grapes in Southern California. Soon the colony's vineyards were the largest in California, but a fungus disease destroyed them in 1885. The colony switched to growing Valencia oranges. Actress Helena Modjeska and author Henryk Sienkiewicz (Quo Vadis) came from the Mother Colony. In 1929, the house was taken over by the Mother Colony Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Since 1929, the house has been an Orange County museum. The City of Anaheim purchased the house in 1950, and since 1962 the Anaheim Public Library has managed it. Next to the Mother Colony house is the two-story historic John Woelke House. Modjeska House is also a California Historical Landmark. George Hansen Founder of Anaheim: George HansenGeorge Hansen, known as the \\"Father of Anaheim\\", was a surveyor and a civil engineer.
