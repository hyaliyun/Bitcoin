Early life and education Coutanche was born in Saint Saviour, Jersey; the younger son and third child to Adolphus Arnold Coutanche (1856‚Äì1921) and Jane Alexandrina Finlayson (d. 1909). He was educated at Jersey High School and Victoria College before going to study law at the University of Caen. He then attended Carlisle and Gregson's London Academy with the intention of entering the Indian Civil Service. However, although he passed the entrance examination for the Indian Civil Service, he was rejected on health grounds due to the discovery of a systolic heart murmur. Early career Having studied law before attempting to enter the civil service, Coutanche entered the chambers of John Beaumont at the Middle Temple in 1912. He aimed to practise at the Chancery bar, but was instead called to the Jersey bar in 1913. Upon the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Coutanche served as an assistant to a government secretary in Jersey. He was ineligible to join the Inns of Court regiment due to his previously discovered heart murmur. Therefore, he went to work at a munitions factory, rising from a worker through to management level. He was called to the English bar in 1915. In 1917, he volunteered for work with the War Claims Commission and was posted to Belgium with the rank of Lieutenant. During his time in Belgium, he won the Belgian Croix de Guerre and was appointed chevalier of the Order of the Crown (Belgium). He left the army in 1920 with the rank of Captain. He returned to his chambers in London, but then had to return to work at the Jersey chambers due to the illness of his father. He was elected a Deputy of Saint Helier in 1922, and married Ruth Sophia Joan Gore in 1924. Attorney-General and Bailiff of Jersey In 1925, Coutanche was appointed Solicitor-General, and went on to reform the department of the law officers and reorganised the States Greffe of the States of Jersey. He was promoted to Attorney-General in 1931. In 1935, the bailiff of Jersey, Charles de Carteret, retired. Coutanche was promoted to this office. As the last bailiff appointed before the passage of a law on the Bailiff in 1936, he was the last bailiff appointed for life and the last under the sole prerogative of the Crown without the obligation to consult the States of Jersey. As the bailiff of Jersey also fulfills the function of Deputy Governor, Coutanche took on the additional role of Governor of Jersey when the island was demilitarised in 1940 by King George VI. During the German Occupation of Jersey 1940‚Äì1945 The UK Home Office instructed the Lieutenant-Governor of Jersey that the Bailiff of Jersey should take over his responsibilities, and that the Bailiff and Crown Officers should remain at their posts. The Lieutenant-Governor discussed with the Bailiff the matter of being required to carry on administration under German orders. Coutanche considered that this would be contrary to his oath of allegiance, but he was instructed otherwise.Cruickshank, Charles G. (1975) The German Occupation of the Channel Islands, The Guernsey Press, The States of Jersey passed the Defence (Transfer of Powers) (Jersey) Regulation 1940 on 27 June 1940 to amalgamate the various executive committees into 8 departments each under the presidency of a States Member. The presidents along with the Crown Officers made up the Superior Council under the presidency of the Bailiff. Coutanche's remarks to Professor Karl Heinz Pfeffer, head of the Great Britain department at the Institute for Foreign Affairs (Berlin) during the latter's visit to Jersey in 1941 were reported by Pfeffer. Coutanche's explanation of \\"decent\\" co- existence between Jewish and Christian traditions and people in Jersey can, according to Sanders, be interpreted as disapproval of anti-Jewish policy. Coutanche refused to ratify the registration of the eighth order requiring the wearing of a yellow star as a \\"measure too far\\" After the Liberation He was knighted in 1946. He was made a life peer in the Birthday Honours of 1961 taking the title of Baron Coutanche, of St Brelade in the Island of Jersey and of the City of Westminster. He retired as bailiff in 1961. During the period when he was simultaneously a member of the legislatures of Jersey and the United Kingdom he sat as a crossbencher in the House of Lords; upon his retirement as bailiff he took the Conservative whip. He was an honorary Bencher of the Middle Temple and Doctor of Laws of the University of Caen.

An Architectural Guidebook to Brooklyn, p. 310. Salt Lake City, Gibbs Smith. In the mid-nineteenth century, new religious congregations were gathering in the area because of the proximity to South Ferry and Manhattan. Immigrant centers were developing around their respective churches and more churches were being built: In 1887, the Brooklyn Daily Eagle called Clinton Street \\"a highway of churches,\\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 2, 1887 and described twelve erected between 1841 and 1869 between Pierrepont Street and Third place on Clinton Street. One of these was the Second Unitarian Church, built in 1858 on the corner of Clinton and Congress Streets. History Unitarian liberal families moved to Brooklyn mainly from New England as well as from Europe, and between 1833 and 1902 organized four congregations in Brooklyn, New York. The first service of the Unitarian Congregation in Brooklyn was held in 1833. In 1835, the congregation purchased the existing Second Presbyterian Church on Adams Street for their use. In 1837, Rev. Frederick W. Holland became a minister of the congregation. According to Olive Hoogenboom, the church biographer, Holland's preaching was too orthodox for some of the families and the congregation divided. The new Society, called the Second Unitarian Congregational Society, formed in 1840 with Rev. Frederick A. Farley as its Minister. When Rev. Holland resigned from the First Unitarian Society in 1842, the congregations reunited for a short time, but differences in ideology opened old wounds, and in 1851 the Second Unitarian Society began to hold separate services again. For several years, in order to hold service and Sunday School, the Second Society had to rent rooms in various locations throughout Brooklyn Heights. In 1853, Rev. Samuel Longfellow became minister of the Second Church and the decision was made to build a permanent home for the congregation. This permanent church was built on the corner of Clinton and Congress streets, on property leased from the Catholic Church. Jacob Wrey Mould was chosen as an architect of the church. One of the most prominent leaders of the Second Unitarian Church was Rev. Samuel Longfellow. Under his leadership (1853‚Äì60), the New Chapel was built giving the congregation a permanent home. Longfellow's strong abolitionist preaching was not popular among the new members of the church. In the First Unitarian Church pamphlet printed for the occasion of the 125th anniversary, we can read ‚Äúsome of us went around and let all the benches, and then Mr. Longfellow preached a John Brown sermon and drove them all away.‚Äù (Chase, 8) However the liberal members of the Congregation loved their Minister. Because of Longfellow's strong abolitionist preaching the Church was controversial and grew in debt as some members felt offended. Longfellow resigned from his ministry in the Second Church in April 1860, yet his abolitionist preachings were resounded only a year later by the start of the American Civil War. Following Rev. Longfellow, the Rev. Nahor A. Staples (1861‚Äì63) became head of the church. His preaching strongly supported abolitionism and the science of the Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin‚Äôs discoveries. During the American Civil War, the Second Church was involved in organizing donations to the Union front. His successor, the Rev. John White Chadwick, also a supporter of Darwinism, lead the church from 1864 to 1904. He continued preaching the type of theology of previous minister‚Äôs publishing most of his sermons. Chadwick attracted many new members with his preaching and the Congregation was finally able to pay its debt in 1872. The Brooklyn Ethical Association held its first meetings in the Second Unitarian Church in 1880s having Chadwick as one of its most valuable members. The Second Church‚Äôs Female Employment Society had also grown out of ‚Äúthe Little Church on the Corner‚Äù. According to Olive Hoogenboom, the First Church historian, \\"The Second Church remained a center of controversy for half of its seventy-four-year existence\\" (47). After Rev. John White Chadwick, the Second Unitarian Church was led by Rev. Caleb S. S. Dutton (1907‚Äì14) and Rev. Charles H. Lyttle (1914‚Äì24), the last minister of the Second Church who brought the two Societies together in 1924. During this time, the Brooklyn neighborhood was changing rapidly. In 1876, ground was broken for a revolutionary tenement building for the working class, designed by Alfred T. White. After the Brooklyn Bridge opened in 1883, more working- class people coveted Brooklyn for both its proximity to Manhattan and its affordability and spaciousness. In the early 1900s, the population in Brooklyn again changed drastically. New immigrants from Europe and other parts of the Americas were arriving daily. Brooklyn residents with established wealth were migrating to less crowded areas of Brooklyn, or Long Island. Both the First and the Second Unitarian Churches suffered great losses within its members between 1910 and 1920. It was a time for both congregations to consolidate. On the last Sunday of December 1924, the Second Unitarian Congregation held a closing service at their Little Chapel. They merged with the First Unitarian Congregation in Brooklyn. The Third and Fourth Congregations followed. Because the ground on which the church was built did not belong to the Unitarian Congregation, the building was ‚Äúrootless‚Äù (Chase, 8) in a sense. After the Second Congregation reunited with the First one, the ‚ÄúLittle Church on the Corner‚Äù was abandoned, the lease was sold bringing very little profit (Hoogenboom, 229) and the belongings were sold or given away. In the 1940s, the Catholic Church sold the land with the church building and two large houses that also existed on the property. The houses that occupied the west of the property were torn down shortly. In 1962, three years before the establishment of the Landmark Preservation Commission, the church was torn down and the ground was designated by a new developer to build a new supermarket for the neighborhood. Cobble Hill Park The neighborhood protested and insisted on designating the area for a park, which Cobble Hill did not have. As a result of the demands of the residents, on March 7, 1963 the plot became City property. On July 14, 1965 the Cobble Hill Park was dedicated, with historical houses surrounding it. After renovation in 1989 the little park has geometrically patterned bluestone paving, trees, playground, benches, cast iron fence, and granite entrance columns. Architecture Jacob Wrey Mould was commissioned as the architect for the Second Unitarian Church in Brooklyn. Ground was broken in June 1857. The estimated cost of the building was originally US$14,000, however it eventually cost more than $25,000, leaving the Congregation with debt of more than $10,000. On March 2, 1858, Rev. Longfellow dedicated the New Chapel on the corner of Clinton and Congress for its use. The debt was finally paid in 1872. The building was abandoned in 1924 and demolished in 1962, three years before Landmark Preservation Commission was established in New York. According to the Brooklyn Daily Eagle of March 3, 1858, the Second Unitarian Church was designed in the Anglo- Italian style (original for its time), and it was much different in appearance from other churches in the neighborhood.Brooklyn Daily Eagle, March 3, 1858 The building was eighty-six feet long and seventy-five feet wide in the transept. The nave was forty feet wide and the transept ‚Äì thirty-five. The floor to ceiling height was twenty-five feet. The masonry building was made of brick and overlaid with brown mastic. Aside from the brown mastic on the exterior, there was a ‚Äúwater table‚Äù line made of brown stone with wide stripe of Philadelphia faced brick on the top. The building was in the shape of the cruciform, with a low pitched roof covered with green and purple octagon slates in alternate rows ‚Äì resembling a tortoise for which the church was called by some ‚Äúthe Church of the Holy Turtle‚Äù, however more often it was called ‚Äúthe Little Church on the Corner‚Äù or ‚ÄúNew Chapel‚Äù. Its pastor John White Chadwick described the church in his poem: > It is perfectly true that the roof is low, And the reason why they built it > so Is that money ran short, you know, For the queer little church on the > corner.Hoogenboom 50. In the centre of the roof was an ornate wooden ventilator, and the entire ridge of the roof was finished with the ‚Äúridge crest‚Äù. The cornice was made of Caen stone and Philadelphia brick. The building had seventeen arched, stained glass windows with the tracery made of Caen stone. Located at the north-west corner of the church was a tower that measured forty-one feet. The tower was topped with a twenty-three feet tall octagonal belfry. The base of the belfry was ornamented with encaustic tiles on the face of the stonework. The roof of the tower was covered with slate tiles, with a cross above. The main entrance to the church was located at Clinton Street, through a porch, above which there was a rose-window with stained glass framed with Caen stone. Under the window was an inscription, \\"The truth shall make your free\\"‚Äìa famous quotation of the Church's beloved pastor, Rev. Longfellow. Inside he Church the walls were pearl grey. The ceiling was rose-tinted and moulded between heavy beams of open timber roof, and part of the ceiling in the apse area was azure. The church held 104 pews made from black walnut and pine and upholstered with crimson damask, they were able to seat six hundred people. There were no obstructions as pillars or gallery, so the pulpit could be seen from every place in the church. To the right of the altar was a separate minister's room ‚Äúwith every convenience‚Äù (Brooklyn Eagle, 2) and to the left, the organ and a place for the choir. During cold days the church was heated with furnaces. The building also contained a basement where the Sunday school and Library were located.

It won an Academy Award in 1936 for Best Short Subject (Novelty). It described the 1933 Houston-Westland expedition, in which Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton, otherwise known as Lord Clydesdale, piloted a single-engined biplane on 3 April 1933, just clearing Everest's southern peak by a few feet, having been caught in a powerful downdraught. The film used mixture of real footage of Everest from the record- breaking flight and theatrically produced scenes using the actual people rather than actors. The flight used two aircraft that took off from Purnea, India on 3 April 1933. One aircraft was Westland PV-3 which had undergone some additional changes, and the other aircraft was a Westland PV-6. Lord Clydesdale flew the PV-3 and Lieutenant David McIntyre in the PV-6. The aircraft were not pressurized but they did use bottled oxygen. As mentioned, the film about this flight won an Oscar in the United States in 1936, in addition, aerial photos would go onto be used by mountaineers including Tenzing and Hillary's expedition which reached the summit on foot. The aerial photos were made on a second flight on 19 April 1933 as during the first flight there was a dusty haze that obscured the photographs from the 3 April flight. Wings over Everest was preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2014, in partnership with the UCLA Film and Television Archive.

Geography The Barton Gulch site is located in Madison County on a tributary of the Ruby River between the Greenhorn Range and Ruby Range.1\\\\. Beauchamp 2007, p. 45 Dr. Les Davis excavated Barton Gulch from 1987 through 1993, and found 37 features that were each arranged into four distinct aggregations. Each of these aggregations contains a central oxidized pit that is 30-centimeters deep and surrounds each basin. A string of small features, representing a living floor site, form a circle around each oxidized basin. History Barton Gulch, also known as the Barton Gulch Alder Complex, was discovered in 1972 and first excavated in 1979. Barton Gulch is dated to 9400 RCYBP,2\\\\. Beauchamp 2007, p. 45 and was actually during intensive mining projects in the late 1970s. Barton Gulch, along with the Alder site, are regarded as the type sites for the Blackwater Draw Paleo-Indian archaeological culture, and believed to be a Clovis culture. Most of the excavations of Barton Gulch were done by Dr. Les Davis, a professor at Montana State University, in the late 1980s and early 1990s. There has also been an intermediate amount of mining done at Barton Gulch for gold due to the presumption that the source of gold found in Barton Creek could have moved its way down the channel into the area. Climate During the late Pleistocene period, the climate began a dramatic change. It is unknown how and why exactly the climate changed, but scientists speculate that the Earth's orbit around the sun changed, leading to an evident increase in the amount of sunlight exposed to the planet.3\\\\. Thomas 2000, p. 156 As the Pleistocene period gave way to the Paleo-Indian period, so did the harsh winter climates give way to a suitable warm climate. Strong evidence for the warm climate is the many warm-weather plants that have been found during excavations at Barton Gulch. Flora and fauna Barton Gulch included various animals that have rarely been seen in Paleo-Indian cultures. Such animals included the cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.), hare (Lepus sp.), mink (Mustela vison), porcupine (Orithizon dorsatum) and deer (Odocoileus sp.). The bones of the deer were used to make hammerstones and other small tools. Small tools that were made from the bones of the animals include knives, flake tools, end scrapers, abrading stones and points.4\\\\. Bruhns 1999, p. 41 Also, due to the warm weather, Barton Gulch contained many different edible plant species. Identified at Barton Gulch were remains of charred seeds, stems, spines, and other elements from over thirty different plant species. These plans were recovered from a series of over one hundred cooking features. These discoveries suggest that the people of the area used plants for various purposes such as food, medicine, in ceremonies, tools and weapons. People The people of Barton Gulch are thought to have been seasonally semi nomadic, meaning that although the people's living habits were largely nomadic, they do participate in planting crops at specific locations.5\\\\. Scarre 2005 Excavations suggest that the people were logistically organized, kin-related aggregates of hunter-gatherers.6\\\\. Soffer 1993, p. 265 Remains of earth ovens at Barton Gulch were identified as a possible technique of processing plants and animals into food. The presence of earth ovens and other cooking features implies that the people had detailed procedures for preparing plant and animal remains.7\\\\. Nelson 2006, p. 817 The identification of the many different tools from the animal bones suggests that there were many different activities being done by the men and women of Barton Gulch. The first known Barton Gulch female was called Laura of the ChunN clan. Notes *Beauchamp, R; Boyce D (2007), Foragers of the Terminal Pleistocene in North America, U of Nebraska Press, *Bruhns, K.

These included many of the \\"Sonny Jim\\" comedies (about a mischievous child). He also wrote three films. In 1932, he posed as George Washington for two artistic efforts. The first was for painter Hattie Elizabeth Burdette. Johnson posed in a Masonic apron wearing the same jewel Washington himself had worn.

Intercellular fat is bound in the globular form by phospholipid membranes, which are hydrophobic. This means that fat globules are insoluble in water. In simpler terms: a vacuole or droplet of triglyceride or some other blood lipid, which is located inside a cell that is not an adipocyte (fat cell), as opposed to fat cells in between other cells in an organ. Lipids and any lipid digestive derivatives must be transported in the globular form within the cell, blood and tissue spaces due to its insolubility. Globules of fat are emulsified in the stomach into small droplets by bile salts during food digestion, speeding up the rate of digestion by the enzyme lipase later on. Bile salts possess detergent properties that allow them to emulsify fat globules into smaller emulsion droplets, and then into even smaller micelles. This increases the surface area for lipid-hydrolyzing enzymes to act on the fats. Micelles are roughly 200 times smaller than emulsion droplets, allowing them to facilitate transport monoglycerides and fatty acids across the surface of the enterocyte, where absorption occurs.http://courses.washington.edu/conj/bess/fats/fats.html Milk fat is another form of intracellular fat found in the mammary glands of female mammals.

He was a fast-medium bowler who captured over 500 wickets in his career, and also a useful enough batsman almost to rank as an all-rounder. He was also a fine rugby player, appearing at county level and in schoolboy internationals.David Lemmon, The History of Surrey County Cricket Club, Christopher Helm, 1989, , p253. His cricket career, though reasonably successful, could be considered an unlucky one. He never took 100 wickets in a season, but came close on several occasions. His best season with the bat saw him fall just four runs short of 1,000 runs. He never made a century, but had scores of 98 and 95 not out. Worst of all, he was struck down by an injury that all but finished his career just as he had appeared to have reached his peak.  Early career  Gibson made a promising beginning in first-class cricket in 1957, taking ten wickets in the match against Gloucestershire, in only his second appearance for the first team and on his debut in the County Championship. Taking ten wickets in a match was a feat that he would never repeat. In spite of this early success, with Alec Bedser and Peter Loader almost ever present as the opening bowlers, he made only one further appearance that season. However he could reflect that he had been a part, if a minor one, of the Surrey side that had won the Championship for an unprecedented sixth season in succession. In his three matches he had taken 17 wickets at an average of 15.58. In 1958, Surrey won the Championship yet again, the last time that they would do so during Gibson's career. With Alec Bedser having to miss the first half of the season through pneumonia,David Lemmon, The History of Surrey County Cricket Club, Christopher Helm, 1989, , p252. Gibson had more opportunities. In 14 matches he took 37 wickets at 19.75. He also made his first fifty with the bat. In 1959 he played in 22 matches, and captured 56 wickets. His average, however, was a disappointing 29.37. This may be at least partly explained by the fact that 1959 was the driest and sunniest summer for some years, so that conditions were more in favour of the batsmen.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 2000 edition, \\"Summers of the Century\\" by Philip Eden. He himself managed 405 runs at 16.20, and improved his highest score to 80.  Later career  In 1960, he had perhaps the best season of his career with the ball. In 27 matches he had 90 victims at 17.60. His innings figures of 7‚Äì26 against Derbyshire would remain his career best. With the bat he had 399 runs at 15.96, with a highest score of 95*. He played in 24 games in 1961. Though his average declined to 22.30, he took 95 wickets, the closest he would ever get to reaching 100. In 1962 he was only able to play in 7 matches, taking 19 wickets at 29.88. The next year, he played in 26 fixtures, and captured 77 wickets at 23.32. 1964 saw him appearing in 17 matches and taking 50 wickets at 23.86. In recent years his batting had seemed to be in decline, and he had not made a fifty since 1961. But in 1965, in his 32 games he came within four runs of reaching his thousand for the season. His average was more than twice that in any previous season, and he made five fifties, one of them the highest score of his career of 98. His final tally was 996 runs at 34.34. He also had a fine season with the ball, with 86 wickets at 20.47, on nine occasions taking five or more wickets in an innings, with best figures of 6/11. Seeming to be at the peak of his career, he had cartilage trouble at the start of the 1966 season.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, 1967 edition, p563. He was only able to play in a handful of matches thereafter ‚Äì just one that season, eight in 1967, none in 1968 and four in 1969 ‚Äì before being forced to retire. He did enough in his eight matches in 1967 to show what Surrey had been missing, with 300 runs at 37.50 and 18 wickets at 24.55. He played in the Gillette Cup, a List A competition, from its inception in 1963 until he retired in 1969. However he had no outstanding performances. When Surrey reached the Final against Yorkshire in 1965 and were heavily defeated, he took 1/66 in the 13 overs that bowlers were then permitted, and scored a duck.Scorecard of 1965 Gillette Cup Final.

Like other nineteenth-century warships, she was heavily furnished and decorated with wood, which the Spanish failed to remove prior to combat and which would feed fires during the battle.Conway's All The World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 382 In 1895 she was the flagship of the representative squadron deployed to represent Spain at the opening of the Kiel Canal.Engineering (1895), vol. 59, p. 727 Operational history Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was the flagship of Spanish Vice Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete, commander of the Spanish Navy's 1st Squadron, when tensions with the United States were rising after the explosion and sinking of the US battleship Maine in the harbor at Havana, Cuba on 15 February 1898. The squadron concentrated at S√£o Vicente in Portugal's Cape Verde Islands; departing Cadiz on 8 April 1898. Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa, the armored cruiser , and three destroyers arrived at S√£o Vicente on 14 April 1898, experiencing machinery problems and burning excessive amounts of coal during the voyage.Nofi, pp. 58, 78 As more ships arrived over the next few days, it was noted that the 140 mm guns aboard Infanta Maria Teresa had defective breech mechanisms and had been supplied with defective ammunition, and that the fleet had a shortage of stokers.Nofi, p. 78 The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out while Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was at S√£o Vicente. Ordered by neutral Portugal in accordance with international law to leave S√£o Vicente within 24 hours of the declaration of war, Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and the rest of Cervera's squadron departed on 29 April 1898, bound for San Juan, Puerto Rico. The fleet reached French-owned Martinique in the Lesser Antilles on 10 May 1898. While the large ships loitered in international waters, two of the Spanish destroyers went into Fort-de-France to ask for coal. France was neutral and would not supply coal, so the Spanish squadron departed on 12 May 1898 for the Netherlands-owned Cura√ßao, where Cervera expected to meet a collier. Cervera arrived at Willemstad on 14 May, but the Netherlands also was neutral, and strictly enforced its neutrality by allowing only Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and her sister ship to enter port and permitting them to load only 600 tons of coal. Cervera's ships departed on 15 May, no longer bound for San Juan, which by now was under a U.S. Navy blockade, but for as-yet unblockaded Santiago de Cuba on the southeastern coast of Cuba, arriving there on 19 May 1898. Cervera hoped to refit his ships there before he could be trapped. His squadron was still in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba when an American squadron arrived on 27 May 1898 and began a blockade which would drag on for 37 days.Nofi describes Cervera's voyage, pp. 80, 83‚Äì86 The blockade wore on, with Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and the others enduring occasional American naval bombardments of the harbor.Nofi, p. 163, claims that Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa suffered 35 hits and the death of her executive officer during an American bomdardment on 6 June 1898, but Cervera's papers, p. 101, and The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website: Reina Mercedes both ascribe this damage and the death to Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa still faced a serious problem with her 140 mm gun ammunition, 80 percent of which defective.Nofi, p. 169 Some of her crewmen joined others from the fleet in a Naval Brigade to fight against a U.S. Army overland drive toward Santiago de Cuba.Nofi mentions the Naval Brigade on pp. 146, 172 By the beginning of July 1898, the US thrust threatened to capture Santiago de Cuba, and Cervera decided that his squadron's only hope was to escape into the open sea by running the blockade. The decision was made on 1 July 1898, with the break-out set for 3 July 1898. The crew of Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa spent 2 July 1898 returning from Naval Brigade service and preparing for action. With Vice Admiral Cervera aboard, Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was to lead the escape, sacrificing herself by attacking the fastest American ship, armored cruiser , allowing the rest of the squadron to avoid action and run westward for the open sea.Nofi discusses Cevera's plan, on pp. 172‚Äì73 The Spanish ships put seaward at 0845 hrs on 3 July 1898. The US ships sighted the Spanish ships in the channel at about 0935, and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba began.Nofi, p. 175 As lead ship in the Spanish line, Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa was the first ship to receive concentrated fire from the blockading U.S. Navy squadron. With Vizcaya close behind her and the other Spanish ships turning hard to starboard to flee to the west, Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa charged Brooklyn as if to ram, closing the range to by 1005 hours, forcing Brooklyn to turn to the east. Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa turned west, brushing past the last obstacle in her path, the armed yacht , as the battleship came up at a range of to port, with battleships and close behind Iowa. A general engagement ensued, with the US ships to starboard of Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa and both sides firing at maximum rates.Nofi, pp. 176‚Äì77 One of the first shells Iowa fired hit the after main- battery turret of Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa, killing or wounding its crew and knocking out its gun. Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa had already taken many hits, and now Brooklyn and battleship began to hit her repeatedly. Fires broke out, threatening to detonate her ammunition magazines. Seeing no hope for the ship and wishing to save as many of her crew as possible, Cervera at 1020 hours ordered the ship beached. She turned to starboard and ran aground at 1025 hours a few miles west of Santiago de Cuba and just west of Punta Cabrera. The colors were struck and the magazines were flooded to prevent explosions.Nofi, pp. 177‚Äì78 Some of the ship's crewmen made it ashore, although they had to beware of Cuban insurgents, who began to shoot the survivors of the wrecked Spanish ships. Others were rescued by American sailors who brought small boats alongside the wrecks to take off survivors.Nofi, p. 183 After the war, the US Navy refloated Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa in an attempt to put her into service. She was towed to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for preliminary repairs, then was towed by repair ship toward Norfolk, Virginia, where her repairs could be completed. Caught in a storm during the voyage, she began to founder. Repair ship Merritt took off her crew, and Infanta Mar√≠a Teresa sank between two reefs off Cat Island in the Bahamas with a broken back, a total loss. One of the 140 mm guns was salvaged and is on display in Groton, Connecticut. Another of the cannon (with battle damage) is on display at Veterans Memorial Park in Ottumwa, Iowa. The plaque on the cannon reads, \\"This Cannon was taken from the battleship The Maria Theresa, flag ship of admiral Cervera's fleet in the war with Spain in 1898.

Musical style and lyrics  Ronald Ziegler of the German Horrible Eyes fanzine described the sound of Rabid Death's Curse as \\"very Swedish, very Death Metalish\\".Ronald Ziegler: Merchandise whorery, accessed on 3 November 2012. According to Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic, the album \\"suggested that Watain were, at best, content to produce intentionally crude facsimiles of inspirational forefathers ranging from Bathory to Mayhem and, at worst, unable to do anything else\\".Eduardo Rivadavia: Rabid Death's Curse - Watain, accessed on 16 November 2012. Rivadavia described the production as \\"muddy\\" and \\"less-than-ideal\\". According to the band's vocalist, Erik Danielsson, \\"[t]here were some minor mistakes regarding the productions which could have been done better, but on the other hand it is stuff that you hear after listening to it through and through far too much. At least it does not sound as whatever cheap fucking 'primitive, cult, limited, true underground Black Metal' shit out there, which is a relief. I like the album, it's one of the better to come from Sweden, it's just my sense of perfection that haunts at times.\\" The lyrics are based upon \\"Satanism, or‚Äîto avoid confusion‚ÄîDevilworship\\" and play \\"a terribly important role in our creations\\". Danielsson explained the title as \\"a rather personal attempt of mine to symbolically explain the idea of salvation through spiritual slavery and the will to serve. [‚Ä¶] To put it briefly, the Rabid Death's Curse is the curse of life, the disease which we are condemned to suffer from until divine punishment comes upon us.\\"  Artwork  Davthvs was \\"responsible for almost the whole layout, as well as the rather successful idea of printing the LP inside out, so that the lustreless side was turned out\\". Danielsson, who draws artwork for Watain and other bands himself, was \\"very pleased in working with such a talented man\\". The gatefold contains a photography \\"which is a bit hard to at 1st sight--but when the observer looks at it a bit more he witnesses it's a turned upside down photo of a decayed bird surrounded by flying autumn leaves\\"; the idea came from Danielsson although dead birds are the responsible artist's trademark. Davthvs found a dead bird and scanned it for the artwork. According to Danielsson, \\"there's much symbolism behind the usage of the bird. A dead, decayed bird represents to me the death of freedom, and the beauty that lies in the silent process of its way into ashes and dirt. It also visualises the idea of the \\"Rabid Death's Curse\\" quite well, the molten dead lying in slumber, walking towards the unescapable claws of Satan!\\"  Reviews  Rivadavia wrote that although Rabid Death's Curse \\"suggested that Watain were, at best, content to produce intentionally crude facsimiles of inspirational forefathers ranging from Bathory to Mayhem and, at worst, unable to do anything else\\", \\"the Swedes were really just finding their feet\\" and the album \\"fulfills an important function in Watain's career arc, one that the casual listener need never pay heed to, but which loyal fans will likely want to explore at some point in order to better comprehend all that followed\\".

History  The village was settled in 1757Historic and Archaeological Resources of Richmond, Rhode Island: A Preliminary Report, Rhode Island Historical Preservation Commission, December 1977 and was the site of industrial activity early in its history due to the ready availability of hydropower from the river. Brand's Iron Works existed on the Hopkinton side of the river by 1787, and Brothers Cotton Mill was established on the Richmond side of Wyoming in 1814. The New London Turnpike (Rhode Island Route 3) was built through the area in 1815.According to The Turnpikes of New England (Frederic James Wood (1919), The Turnpikes of New England and Evolution of the Same through England, Virginia, and Maryland, Marshall Jones Company.

David Laurie died in Brussels, 1897. David Laurie Letter Head Quotes \\"...I will now relate the purchase and sale of a grand Stradivarius violin, which while giving me a good deal of trouble one way and another, also brought me fame as a reliable expert. To be a good expert requires three important gifts, which must be inborn and yet require to be developed with much study. These three gifts are an unerring eye, a good memory, and a good ear. The first two are absolutely essential to distinguish the work of different makers, and also the work of the same maker in instruments of widely different appearance and of different periods of his life. Instruments by the same maker have invariably certain characteristics of his handiwork, which while unnoticed by ordinary folk,reveal them at once to the expert. The third gift is not considered by any means necessary to the making of an expert, yet I think I am justified in saying that a good ear plays an important part in the work and is a valuable gift, which ought to be cultivated and developed to its utmost, if it were for nothing else than to be able to distinguish one tone from another and to decide which has the best carrying power and which is in most repute with the majority of musical folk, artistes and amateurs alike. For after all, to the great majority of concert-goers the tone of a violin is the most important part of it, and they neither know nor care who the maker is so long as the player delights them with its music. In this purchase which I am about to relate I put my ear to a severe test in judging whether a fiddle was likely to be worth purchasing or not and it did not fail me.\\" \\\\- The Reminiscences of a Fiddle Dealer was published three times. First edition published in 1900, Third edition was published by Harold M. Chaitman in 1977. In discussing violin set up with his clients, David Laurie stated: \\"Take your violin to a reliable man, and get it mounted and let the mountings alone. Just so surely as you begin altering this or that you alter the tone,and undo the work of some experienced man who knows his business.\\" If you love your violin, follow this advice and you will not regret it.\\" References *The Reminiscences of a Fiddle Dealer by David Laurie *Violin Fraud: Deception, Forgery, Theft, and Lawsuits in England and America By Brian W.

Anderson was added to the cast in a bid to add more \\"sex appeal\\" to the show. She said it was her dream job and relocated to Sydney immediately to accommodate filming. The character made her on-screen debut during the episode airing on 6 June 2008. Charlie was billed as having a \\"warm heart\\" and being \\"family oriented\\"; however, her actions are often misunderstood and her persona has been perceived as \\"brash\\". She is described as being \\"passionate about her work\\" and often neglects her daughter, Ruby's (Rebecca Breeds) needs. Charlie's first notable storyline was a lesbian relationship with Joey Collins (Kate Bell). The storyline was implemented by producers to boost ratings and Anderson said it helped portray Charlie's vulnerable side. The storyline angered Christian and conservative oriented family groups. They complained that Home and Away had featured sexualised plotlines unsuitable for children. As a result, producers cut scenes to attune to viewers' wishes, which outraged the LGBT community. The storyline came to a natural end and Anderson and executive producer Cameron Welsh praised the plot because it portrayed a real-life situation and denounced the conservative views as outdated. Anderson stated that the storyline was a great one to portray in terms of acting. Charlie's sexuality was sidelined and she began a relationship with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Throughout their romance Charlie played out various family oriented plots and was described as having strong feelings for him. Their romance was portrayed to be wayward and unstable. In 2011, their relationship ended after producers felt there were no more storylines to give to the pair. Charlie later develops feelings for Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke). Another notable storyline for Charlie saw her reveal that her supposed sister, Ruby, was in fact her daughter. Anderson said the filming process was challenging as they felt the need to get the story right. Viewers sympathised with Charlie and saw a \\"beautiful element\\" in the portrayal. The revelation ruined the on-screen relationship between Charlie and Ruby, and was never repaired. Charlie has received critical analysis through her storylines and persona and opinion has been mixed. Ruth Deller of Lowculture said Charlie had endured \\"scandalous- headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity\\", whilst Holy Soap stated that she has a \\"questionable taste in men.\\" The Daily Star liked Charlie's image, which they branded \\"sexy\\", and the Daily Record praised her for the drama she creates. Anderson's portrayal of Charlie has seen her earn various award nominations, including the \\"Most Popular Personality on Australian Television\\" and \\"Most Popular Actress\\" Logie Awards. Charlie departed on 24 January 2012, following Anderson's decision to quit Home and Away. However, in November 2012, it was announced that Anderson had reprised her role and Charlie returned on 17 June 2013. Casting In May 2008, former model Anderson was recruited by Home and Away in a bid to add \\"sex appeal\\" to the show. Anderson was a long-time fan of Home and Away and she said she was \\"thrilled\\" when she won the role of Charlie after an audition. Four days after hearing that she had landed the part, Anderson had to move to Sydney from Melbourne for filming. Anderson has said that her job as a model should not reflect on her acting ability. She added \\"For me, modelling was just an avenue that got me into acting, I have always wanted to act\\". She also stated that the role is her dream job. Development =Characterisation= When Charlie first arrived in the Bay, Channel Seven described her as having a \\"bone to pick and the prowess to do it\\" in reference to her father, Ross' (David Downer) relationship with Morag Bellingham (Cornelia Frances), which Charlie disapproved of because her mother had only recently died. They also described her as having a \\"warm heart\\" and being \\"family oriented\\". Charlie can be \\"misunderstood\\" at times, which makes her appear brash. On her character, Anderson said, \\"Charlie is strong-willed with lots of guts and she is never afraid to show who she is, which makes her genuine and likeable\\". Whilst interviewed by the Llanelli Star, Anderson described Charlie's responsibilities stating: \\"Charlie is very passionate about her work. She cares about Ruby more than life itself and is responsible for her, so these are priorities over a finding a man. I don't think it's a matter of need for her but she definitely would like someone to share her life with and that romantic element is a good balance in Charlie's somewhat serious life.\\" =Relationship with Roman Harris= Charlie's first relationship is with Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby), which was confirmed by Coleby via an interview in TV Week. Roman initially rejects Charlie's advances; until she goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta (Luke Jacobz). Coleby told TV Week that Charlie and Roman's first kiss is a \\"strange moment\\". The pair get off to a bad start because of a misunderstanding. Coleby said that Charlie is \\"feisty\\" and Roman finds that attractive. He added that Roman was not on the rebound after splitting up with Martha MacKenzie (Jodi Gordon) because Roman ended it. Coleby said that his daughter, Nicole Franklin (Tessa James) creates problems with Charlie because Roman \\"has his hands full\\" with her. Charlie's has headstrong expectations of herself and also expects the same from those around her. This trait often causes problems for her romance with Roman. Roman soon tires of Charlie's outlook on life and decides to end their relationship. Coleby told TV Week that \\"whenever things go wrong in life, Charlie sees them as black and white, whereas Roman can see that there are two sides to a story.\\" Coleby opined that Roman has \\"residual feelings\\" for Martha that he is not aware of.Natalie Franklin (Adrienne Pickering) also makes Roman realise that Charlie is \\"kind of irritating\\". Natalie's actions make Roman realise that \\"they're just not suited to each other\\". However, Coleby said that he hoped there was a future for the characters, but felt it was better that they \\"move apart for a while\\". After their break up Charlie gets drunk and goes into work as normal the next day. While on duty Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best) becomes stuck down a storm drain. Charlie attempts to save her but a storm forces the water levels to rise. As Charlie is hungover, Anderson told Inside Soap that \\"Charlie's a bit dazed and confused when all this happens\\". However, she is a \\"professional and goes straight into work mode\\". When Charlie frees Annie, a wave of water floods the drain and Charlie is swept away. Roman then arrives on the scene and fights to save Charlie. Anderson explained that it is up to Roman to save Charlie's life and said \\"of all people it has to be the guy who's just broken her heart\\". Off-screen the scenes in the storm drain posed a series of logistical challenges for the production team. The series had a specially built set for the scenes and they placed jets under the water to create rough waves. Anderson said that she could swim and was not afraid to film in the water. The only problem was the temperature of the water. Anderson said \\"It was absolutely freezing. Filming was tough work, but I think the finished result is worth it.\\" =Relationship with Joey Collins= In 2009, Home and Away producers introduced a storyline that saw Charlie begin a relationship with another woman. Producers hoped the plot would boost the shows ratings. Over five weeks, the storyline would see Charlie realise that her friendship with Joey Collins (played by Kate Bell) is beginning to develop into something else. As they fall for each other, Charlie and Joey share intimate kissing and dance scenes. Anderson explained that the producers came to her about the storyline and asked if she was okay with it, as it was to be emotional and it required commitment. Anderson told them that she was okay with it and she said she was pleased to be given the storyline as it showed more of Charlie's vulnerable side. This was Anderson's first big storyline in the show and she was required to work more hours. Anderson explained that she and Bell formed a trust early on, which helped them to portray the story in the right light. Anderson spoke with gay friends, so she could form an accurate portrayal of her character's feelings. The storyline \\"throws [Charlie's] world upside down\\" and changes her whole identity; it surprises her. Kate Bell (pictured) and Anderson developed a trust early on, which helped them to portray the storyline right. Upon the announcement of the storyline, church and conservative family groups attacked the plot. Pro-Family Perspectives director Angela Conway said \\"They (Home and Away) continue to market to kids and they continue to develop quite sexualised plot lines\\". Two weeks after the storyline began airing, viewing figures for the show fell by over 100,000 and Channel Seven was inundated with complaints from parents asking for their children not to be exposed to same-sex relationships in a family show. Following pressure from the conservative groups, it was announced that Channel Seven had decided to censor a kissing scene between Charlie and Joey. Producers were to cut \\"intimate images\\" from a scene in which the characters share a passionate kiss. Gay and lesbian groups staged protests against the show, despite an announcement from Channel Seven saying that the episode would be shown in its entirety. The broadcaster said the kiss would air as planned, but they had decided against showing a \\"more lusty follow up\\" scene. Seven's head of creative drama and development, Bevan Lee, said Home and Away bosses cut the \\"more lusty follow up because it fitted better with the storyline\\". Lee added that he was \\"saddened\\" that the storyline had been reduced to a \\"facile argument about six missing seconds of screen time and that the bulk of commentators, both conservative and liberal, are making pronouncements on story material they know nothing of\\". British broadcaster, Five, said that they would show the kiss during their airing of the episode. The channel said \\"Five, the UK broadcaster for Home and Away, will screen a lesbian kiss in a forthcoming episode. It forms part of a six-week-long story, about the attraction between two female characters, Joey and Charlie. There will be several episodes where the characters kiss\\". They added that the producers at Channel Seven \\"edit all episodes for artistic and editorial reasons only\\" and the storyline would remain uncompromised in its Australian airing. A Channel Seven spokeswoman revealed that the network received fewer than 30 telephone calls nationally after screening the \\"lesbian kiss\\" episode of the show. The calls were evenly split between those supporting the broadcast of the kiss, and those raising concerns. The show's series producer Cameron Welsh and Anderson both spoke out in defence of the storyline. Welsh said, \\"The idea of this show has always been that we hold a mirror to society ‚Äì and when society changes, we change with it. What's ahead in Home and Away is right not only for the series, but also for the times we are living in\\". Anderson said that she felt it was the right time to tell this story and added, \\"It's really important for us to reflect society, and this storyline is what is going on for many people in real life\\". She also said that she did not think the plot would be so shocking, but was glad the show was exploring a gay relationship. The end of the storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie was seen having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also suggested that Hugo may have been enough to \\"sway\\" Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as \\"the lesbian cop.\\" Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying \\"The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you got to see Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind ‚Äì I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it was a fantastic storyline because for the first time I got to show the producers and audience what I could do.\\" =Relationship with Angelo Rosetta= Luke Jacobz (pictured) played Angelo Rosetta; producers decided to separate Charlie and Angelo to provide a new challenge for them. Charlie's relationship with Angelo has been a focal point in her storylines. They originally date, but break up after Angelo kills Jack Holden (Paul O'Brien). Charlie becomes jealous when Angelo begins dating May Stone (Alin Sumarwata) and Anderson told Inside Soap that \\"Charlie's feelings for Angelo are complex.\\" Charlie cannot fight her attraction to Angleo and the actress claimed that the couple would not have broken up if it had not been for Jack's death. Anderson also stated that the storyline sees a new side to Charlie, jealousy. She decides to get in the way of his new relationship. Anderson went on to explain: \\"She admits part of her wanted to cause trouble, but Angelo is still attracted to Charlie and they sleep together.\\" The actress also defends Charlie's actions claiming she did not intentionally set out to hurt May. Charlie and Angeo's relationship dynamic becomes strained after Charlie refuses to give Angelo an \\"easy life.\\" Although they have a \\"great connection between them\\", Anderson felt Angelo would not put up with Charlie for long because she can be \\"quite bossy.\\" She also said \\"Charlie's got the good end of the stick and poor Angelo is in for a pretty rough ride!\\" Anderson later revealed that Charlie and Angelo would face tough times in 2011, stating: \\"They've had their fair share of hurdles ‚Äì and there are more to come.\\" Charlie and Angelo split up and Anderson admitted she was happy that there is always drama in Charlie's love life and she added \\"I think it's going to be full-on for Ms Buckton this year. But, you know, romances in Summer Bay never last.\\" Of breaking Charlie and Angelo up, Welsh said, \\"The thinking behind that was to challenge the characters and do something a bit different.\\" He went on to explain that with characters who have been together a long time, there is a temptation to repeat storylines and the team wanted to change the dynamic between Charlie and Angelo. =Illegitimate daughter= Another story arc saw Charlie reveal that her sister Ruby Buckton (Rebecca Breeds) is in fact her daughter. Charlie gave birth to Ruby after she was raped by Grant Bledcoe (Clayton Watson), when she was younger. Both Anderson and Breeds found the storyline challenging and felt they had to get it right. Breeds said it made her nervous but was pleased with the end result. She said she had to let it affect her own emotions to effect the viewing public. \\"The revelation ruins their relationship, and Anderson said that Charlie was \\"trying desperately to bridge this gap\\". Breeds added \\"Ruby just wants to get some security back, everything she thought her life was is totally up in the air\\". Ruby becomes confused and starts to ask herself questions such as \\"Where do I stand now?\\" and \\"How do I reconcile this?\\" Breeds said it was a \\"big exploration\\" and a journey for Ruby, with Anderson agreeing. Anderson felt there was a beautiful element to the storyline and opined: \\"Although it is tragic, you feel sorry for Charlie and you can sort of understand where it has all come from.\\" She added that everyone feels sorry for Ruby, meaning neither are wrong. Furthermore, she said, \\"You are just rooting for them, you just want them to get back to how they were and it is a bit of a journey.\\" Comparing the storyline to the lesbian plot she said, \\"Perhaps this storyline was a little bit harder, you've seen the start of this storyline and there is a lot more to come and it wasn't easy.\\" Charlie later struggles to deal with Ruby's relationship with Casey Braxton (Lincoln Younes). Discussing Charlie's motives, Anderson stated: \\"Ruby's at that age where she is quite impressionable, and Charlie doesn't want to see her getting hurt. She's only very recently been in a relationship with Romeo Smith (Luke Mitchell), and Charlie is concerned about her moving from one guy to the next too quickly.\\" Anderson opined it is Darryl Braxton (Steve Peacocke) who gives Charlie her first piece of good parenting advice. She concluded that Charlie's approach only causes conflict with Ruby because she is so strong-willed. =Darryl Braxton= In February 2011, Darryl Braxton was introduced to the show and The Daily Telegraph reported that he was set to get to know Charlie in a future storyline. Charlie meets Darryl after she comes to ask him to keep his surf gang under control. During an interview with Digital Spy, Peacocke was asked if Darryl likes Charlie romantically and he said, \\"For a bloke like Brax, Charlie is pretty ideal ‚Äì she's smart, sexy and is strong enough to take him on. He's all about testing himself and he knows he'll be running a gauntlet if he pursues her. She's got that X-factor he can't ignore.\\" When a fight breaks out at the Surf Club, Charlie arrives to investigate and she asks Darryl to step outside, so they can talk. Darryl misinterprets the situation and believes Charlie just wants to be alone with him, he then kisses her. Charlie is \\"horrified\\" and she arrests Darryl for assaulting a police officer. Peacocke revealed that after the arrest, \\"things will develop dangerously\\" between Charlie and Darryl and that it will be \\"tense to watch!\\" Charlie is put under pressure from the community to find a more serious crime with which to charge Darryl and his gang. She believes that he is selling stolen alcohol to Angelo, but everything checks out and Darryl come to the belief that the kiss has \\"sparked something in Charlie.\\" Darryl is initially unsuccessful in his attempts to win Charlie over, but Anderson hinted that her character would fall for him. She said, \\"I think the way Steve [Peacocke] has played Brax, there is definitely enough there for Charlie to see that he has a heart and to see the good side in him as well.\\" Discussing the plot in which Charlie tried to keep Ruby away from Casey, Anderson said, \\"I think she's also telling herself to stay away from Brax, but Charlie can't get him out of her head.\\" Colin Vickery of The Daily Telegraph said Darryl had turned Charlie's \\"safe police world\\" upside down, and Anderson told him, \\"What is wonderful about this relationship is that it is forbidden love. There is this element of danger that brings excitement along with it.\\" She described the relationship as \\"fun and flirty\\" and said it shows another layer to Charlie, as it has brought out her fun side. The arrival of Darryl's ex-girlfriend Tegan Callahan (Saskia Burmeister) causes Charlie and Darryl to split. However, Vickery said it was obvious that Charlie cannot stay away from Darryl for long. =Departure and death= In November 2011, Jonathon Moran and Elle Halliwell of The Daily Telegraph announced Anderson had quit Home and Away to further her acting career in Hollywood. The following month, Inside Soap writer Sarah Ellis reported Anderson had confirmed her departure from the show. Moran and Halliwell said it was unknown whether Charlie would be killed off or move to The City. On 22 January 2012, The Daily Telegraph's Debbie Schipp reported Anderson had filmed her final scenes with the show in August and they would air later that week. Anderson said she was happy with her decision to leave Home and Away and \\"throw my life in the air and see what happens.\\" On screen, Charlie decided to move to the city with Brax, Ruby and Casey. However, at the end of the show's 23rd season, Charlie was shot twice by Jake Pirovic (Fletcher Humphrys), in revenge for her shooting dead his brother. Charlie was critically injured and rushed to the hospital, where she underwent surgery. Sid Walker (Robert Mammone) later told Ruby that Charlie was being kept alive by a ventilator and that she would not breathe on her own again. Ruby was then left with the decision as to whether she should turn Charlie's life support off or not. Both Ruby and Brax decide Charlie's ventilator should be turned off as there is nothing more the doctors can do for her and Charlie dies. Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said \\"When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well ‚Äì it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it.\\" The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said \\"I started sobbing! But that was the initial shock. You play this character for three and a half years and you really empathise with them. You have to love a part of them ‚Äì it's a little extension of you. So it's just so final, the death. But once I had time to let it sink in, now I'm really, really happy with the ending. It's very dramatic and it's definitely going out with a bang, so to speak!\\" Anderson departed on screen on 24 January 2012. =Return= On 25 November 2012, Debbie Schipp from the Herald Sun reported that Anderson would return to Home and Away in December to shoot \\"a handful of episodes\\" to be broadcast during the following year. Schipp revealed that there was \\"intense speculation\\" about how the writers would get around the fact that Charlie died on-screen in January. Of her return, Anderson explained \\"I told my mum and dad that I was coming back, and they almost fell off their chairs. They said: 'Hang on, didn't Charlie die?' It's hilarious, because this time twelve months ago I was keeping it the biggest secret from everyone as to whether Charlie would live or die, and now I'm in the same boat again as far as not giving anything away.\\" The actress added that the return storyline was outlined a couple of months ago and she just knew that she wanted to do it. Charlie returned on 17 June 2013. Storylines Charlie arrives in Summer Bay to tell Morag Bellingham to leave her father, Ross, alone. However, Ross tells her that he loves Morag. Charlie is partnered with Jack Holden when she starts her job as a Senior Constable at the Yabbie Creek Police Station and her sister, Ruby, arrives in the Bay. Charlie begins a relationship with Roman Harris and she eventually accepts Ross and Morag being together. Ross and Morag marry, but after they come back from their honeymoon, Charlie realises something is wrong with her father. Ross is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, devastating Charlie. He later moves into a home. Roman breaks up with Charlie and she begins drinking and refusing help. She rescues Annie Campbell from a storm drain and nearly dies. She is rescued by Roman, which makes her bitter. Charlie gets a promotion at work and she goes on a date with Angelo Rosetta. Charlie becomes a respected member of the community and she builds up strong friendships with Leah Patterson-Baker (Ada Nicodemou) and Miles Copeland (Josh Quong Tart). Charlie gets involved in Joey Collins' rape investigation. When Joey's brother, Brett (Toby Levins), kicks her out of their home, Charlie invites her to stay at Leah's. Charlie and Joey grow closer and after Charlie saves Joey from drowning, they kiss. Charlie rejects Joey, but she eventually admits that she likes her and they begin a relationship. One night, Charlie gets drunk and sleeps with Hugo Austin. Joey finds out and leaves town. Charlie admits to Angelo that she has feelings for him and they begin dating. Charlie is deliberately run over by Brett during a date with Angelo. She is taken to the hospital and a doctor notices a cesarean scar. Morag confronts Charlie and she claims that she had a baby boy who died. Charlie later tells Angelo and Ruby that she was raped by her boyfriend, Grant, when she was fourteen and that Ruby is actually her daughter. Ruby runs away, but she returns and moves in with Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). Grant arrives in the Bay, horrifying Charlie. She angrily confronts Grant and later kidnaps him and tries to force him into confessing that he raped her. Grant later dies and Charlie becomes the prime suspect. She is arrested, but Ross later confesses to killing Grant. Angelo is promoted to Sergeant and Charlie is promoted to Leading Senior Constable, becoming his second-in-command, which causes tension between the pair; not only does Charlie have to take orders from an officer who was until recently her subordinate, but also has to get used to sharing what had once been her own office. Angelo is forced to leave the police force and Charlie feels guilty when she is made Sergeant. She encourages Angelo when he decides to set up a restaurant. They later decide to end their relationship and agree to remain friends. Ross dies and Charlie and Ruby attend his funeral. The River Boys, a surf gang from Mangrove River, arrive in town and Darryl \\"Brax\\" Braxton begins flirting with Charlie. He later kisses her and Charlie arrests him for assault. Charlie becomes concerned when Ruby tells her that she had sex with Romeo Smith and later suffers a hypoglycemic attack. Charlie discovers Ruby with Casey Braxton and she tells Brax to keep Casey away from Ruby. Charlie is called out to a party at a mansion and arrests Casey. She realises that Ruby was also involved and threatens to stop her from seeing Casey. Brax visits Charlie and they argue. Brax kisses her again and they have sex. Charlie tells him it was a mistake, but she kisses him again and asks him to keep their relationship quiet. Angelo tells Charlie about a marijuana plantation. When Charlie and the other officers get to it, they find and arrest Heath Braxton (Daniel Ewing). Angelo goes missing and Charlie worries that Brax is involved. Angelo is eventually found, but he tells Charlie that he does not remember what happened. Morag and Angelo discover Charlie's relationship with Brax and she decides to end it. The couple eventually get back together. Brax's ex-girlfriend, Tegan, arrives in the Bay and works out Charlie is seeing Brax. Charlie arrests Heath and Jake Pirovic following a drugs raid and Ruby learns of Charlie and Brax's relationship. Brax and Charlie split up again. Charlie is devastated when she learns Brax had sex with Tegan. Charlie arrests Heath again and he is sent to jail. Brax is stabbed and Charlie finds him and gets him to the hospital. She realises she loves him, but Tegan arrives and announces Brax is the father of her daughter. Charlie later learns Tegan was lying. Heath gets out of jail and walks in on Charlie and Brax together. Charlie tells the Inspector about her relationship with Brax, but he allows her stay with the case. During The Great Storm, Tegan is in a car accident and Charlie attends to her, they talk about loving Brax.

She is briefly suspended from her job. Charlie begins investigating an arson attack at Jake's place and she arrests Casey. During his hearing, Casey's lawyer, Hayley O'Connor (Alyssa McClelland), exposes Charlie and Brax's relationship and the Coastal News publishes a front-page article about it. Charlie tells Brax they should be together, but she changes her mind when she learns Brax had sex with Hayley. Charlie investigates a robbery at a petrol station and she goes on a date with Simon Peet (Rory Williamson). Forensics link Brax to the robbery and he tells Charlie he is being set up.

He wishes to remain with her, saying that his brothers no longer need him. Charlie tries to encourage Brax to go back and asks him about Ricky Sharpe (Bonnie Sveen).

The episode featuring Charlie's death was nominated for an Australian Writers' Guild award. Catherine Deveny criticised the reaction to Charlie's lesbian plot Holy Soap described the character's most memorable moment as \\"Locking lips with gal pal Joey\\". In her book Free to a Good Home, author Catherine Deveny criticised the reaction to Charlie and Joey's same sex relationship. She called the first kiss between the couple the \\"TV disappointment of the year\\" and she nicknamed the soap Homo Go Away because the scene in which the kiss featured were diluted to suit certain viewers. Of the decline in ratings during the storyline, Deveny said \\"Since the lesbian plotline began two weeks ago, 100,000 people have turned off. Wow! Turned off. That must be the first time the words 'lesbian' and 'turn off' have occurred in the same sentence. And all we'd seen until Tuesday was lingering touches and intense stares.\\" Deveny then explained that she would rather let her children watch lesbians on television than Christians. She highlighted that only mothers complained to the network about their children being exposed to a same-sex relationship during a family show, not fathers. In September 2010, the Holy Soap website ran a poll to find viewers' favourite Home and Away couple, which Charlie and Angelo won with 45% of the vote. The website branded them as \\"the Bay's criminally hot couple\\" and said they had been keeping viewers glued to their screens with their on/off-relationship. They later said Charlie had a \\"questionable taste in men\\". Peter Dyke, writing for British tabloid the Daily Star, branded Charlie as \\"Sexy\\" and states: \\"Most fellas would not mind feeling the strong arm of the law if this beauty was their local police officer.\\" The Daily Record opined that Charlie's determination to prove Grant as a rapist was \\"dangerously close to an obsession.\\" They also said that ever since Charlie and her family arrived in Summer Bay they have \\"created drama.\\" The character was negatively received by Ruth Deller of television website Lowculture. In May 2009, Deller placed Charlie at number five on her list of worst soap opera characters segment. Deller said, \\"The Summer Bay cop may have lots of storylines, but the LC community don't really approve ‚Äì mainly due to Esther Anderson's apparent lack of acting chops. It's like our hatred for Michelle Connor (Coronation Street) all over again, only this time with added scandalous-headline-grabbing-faux-lesbianity!\\" In July 2009, Deller said, \\"It would be easy to spend every month slagging off Charlie, because there's so much to dislike\\". Deller also added that Charlie's daughter is \\"everything Charlie isn't\\". All About Soap said Charlie and Darryl's chemistry was \\"clear for everyone to see\\" and wondered when she would stop hiding behind her \\"law-abiding facade\\". When Charlie and Darryl share their \\"steamy moment\\", Erin Miller of TV Week said \\"It was the moment we've all been waiting for.\\" Kerry Barrett and Carena Crawford of All About Soap said Charlie was both a \\"sexy sergeant\\" and the soap opera's \\"cutest crime fighter\\". They opined that getting involved with Brax was never going to end well for Charlie but did not suspect she would die. The pair concluded that while it was sad for them, they were unsure how the residents of Summer Bay would manage without Charlie.

Johnson House, also known as Mountjoy Bayly House, Chaplains Memorial Building or Parkington, is an historic house at 122 Maryland Avenue, Northeast, Washington, D.C., in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Built about 1822, it is most notable as the home of Hiram Johnson (1866‚Äì1945), a prominent force in the Progressive Party of the early 20th century and its Vice Presidential candidate under Theodore Roosevelt in the 1912 election. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976, and and contributing property to the Capitol Hill Historic District. History The Hiram W. Johnson House is located on Capitol Hill, occupying a parcel bounded on the north by Constitution Avenue and the south by Maryland Avenue. It is just north of the United States Supreme Court and south of the Hart Senate Office Building, and is oriented facing south toward Maryland Avenue. It is a 2-1/2 story brick building (painted white), with a raised basement and a mansard roof providing a full third floor. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance accessed via side-facing stairs. The entrance surround has pilasters rising to a bracketed segmental-arch pediment. First-floor windows are elongated, and topped by headers decorated with swags. Second-floor windows are topped by splayed lintels with keystones, and have shallow wrought iron balconies. The house was built sometime after the War of 1812 in a Federal style, and was later given its present Second Empire treatment. It was the residence of the second Sergeant at Arms of the Senate, General Mountjoy Bayly. From 1899 to 1924 it was home to an appellate court judge, and it was briefly owned by a band of the Schwarzenau Brethren before it was purchased in 1929 by Hiram Johnson. Owners or occupants since then have included the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Johnson was a politician from California, and a leading voice of progressivism and reform in the Republican Party for many years. He served as Governor of California, implementing a sweeping progressive agenda, and was a founder of the Progressive Party that contested the 1912 election with Johnson as its Vice Presidential candidate. In the 1930s Johnson supported the Democratic New Deal programs. He was also a maverick on foreign policy, steadfastly taking isolationist positions before and after both world wars.

It was established in 1967 by the Louisiana State Legislature, initially as a pilot program to test the feasibility of commuter two-year colleges. History Classes began with 101 students and five full- time faculty, including Edwin T. \\"Eddy\\" Shell, who taught speech for more than forty years at BPCC until his death of cancer in 2008. In 1991, Shell was elected to the Bossier Parish Police Jury, the parish governing board, a position which he also retained until his death.Bossier police juror remembered for smiles, stories  ShreveportTimes  The Times Richard Marvin \\"Dicky\\" Parnell (1940-2018) of Gibsland in Bienville Parish, a former English teacher at Airline High School, was also among the founding faculty of BPCC faculty. He held an Ed.D. from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches and conducted research on the writers of northwestern Louisiana and the culture of the region. The name \\"Bossier Parish Community College\\" was not established until 1973, and academic offerings were expanded in day and evening divisions. Efforts were also made to reach military personnel at Barksdale Air Force Base. In 1977, the Community Education Division began offering non-academic courses. The Northwest Louisiana Police Training Academy (renamed in 1984 as the Criminal Justice Institute) was created to serve ten northwest Louisiana parishes. The Respiratory Therapy Technology program began in 1978. From 1979 to 1984, BPCC was authorized to grant associate degrees in Occupational Studies. Two-year degrees were established in criminal justice, business administration, and office administration. In 1984, an associate degree in data processing was approved. The first commencement ceremony was held in 1980, when eight students received degrees. In 1983, BPCC received accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1995, Bossier Parish Community College entered into articulation agreements with Northwestern State University, Louisiana Tech University in Ruston, Grambling State University in Grambling, Southern Arkansas University in Magnolia, Arkansas, Kilgore Junior College in Kilgore, Texas, and Louisiana State University in Shreveport to assist students in transferring credit hours to four-year institutions. In 2004, BPCC moved to a new $55 million complex on U.S. Highway 80. An associate degree in music was added. The new campus held its grand opening on February 1, 2005. A Health and Physical Education Complex and Performing Arts Theatre officially opened.Bossier Parish Community College Academics In 1996, BPCC added new associate degree programs to the curriculum in Physical Therapist Assistant, Emergency Medical Technician, and Computer Drafting and Design. On July 1, 1997, BPCC became a member of the University of Louisiana System. In May 1999, new programs were added: Associate degrees in Industrial Technology and Theatre; academic certificates in Computer Aided Drafting, Pharmacy Technician, and Telecommunications. On July 1, 1999, BPCC became a member of the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. In 2000, the Board of Regents approved the consolidation of associate degrees in Law Enforcement Technology and Corrections Science into a single Associate of Science in Criminal Justice. The regents also approved the conversion of the Culinary Arts non-credit program to an academic certificate program. In 2001, BPCC joined with Delgado Community College in New Orleans to implement a collaborative Pharmacy Technician program through the use of interactive video.

The head of the ministry is Pralhad Joshi since June 2019. Functions The Ministry of Mines is responsible for survey and exploration of all minerals (other than natural gas and petroleum) for mining and metallurgy of non-ferrous metals like aluminium, copper, zinc, lead, gold, nickel etc. and for administration of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 (MMDR Act) in respect of all mines and minerals other than coal and lignite.

However the Constitution circumscribes this power, by giving Parliament the power under S.No. 54 of the Union list in the VIIth schedule, to enact legislation, and to this extent the States will be bound by the Central legislation. The MMDR Act is the main Central legislation in force for the sector. The Act was enacted when the Industrial Policy Resolution, 1957 was the guiding policy for the sector, and thus was aimed primarily at providing a mineral concession regime in the context of the metal making public sector undertakings. After the liberalization in 1991, a separate National Mineral Policy (NMP) was promulgated in 1993 which set out the role of the private sector in exploration and mining and the MMDR Act was amended several times to provide for a reasonable concession regime to attract the private sector investment including FDI, into exploration and mining in accordance with NMP 1993. National Mineral Policy The first National Mineral Policy was enunciated by the Government in 1993 for liberalization of the mining sector. The National Mineral Policy, 1993 aimed at encouraging the flow of private investment and introduction of state-of-the-art technology in exploration and mining. In the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Tenth Five-Year Plan, it was observed that the main factors responsible for this were procedural delays in the processing of applications for mineral concessions and the absence of adequate infrastructure in the mining areas. To go into the whole gamut of issues relating to the development of the mineral sector and suggest measures for improving the investment climate the Mid-Term Appraisal had proposed the establishment of a High Level Committee. Accordingly, the Government of India, Planning Commission, constituted a Committee on 14 September 2005. under the Chairmanship of Shri Anwarul Hoda, member, Planning Commission. The Committee made detailed recommendations on all of its terms of Reference in December 2006. Based on the recommendations of the High Level Committee, in consultation with State Governments, the Government replaced the National Mineral Policy, 1993 with a new National Mineral Policy on 13 March 2008. The National Mineral Policy 2008 provides for a change in the role of the Central Government and the State Governments to incentivize private sector investment in exploration and mining and for ensuring level playing field and transparency in the grant of concessions and promotion of scientific mining within a sustainable development framework so as to protect the interest of local population in mining areas. This has necessitated harmonization of legislation with the new National Mineral Policy.  Policy reforms The Hoda Committee studied the various reports prepared and submitted by study groups and in- house committees set up by various Ministries from time to time on the issues before the Committee. The Committee gave consideration to the mineral policies of the States as presented by the State Governments, especially to the differing perceptions of mineral-rich and non mineral-rich states. The Committee also gave consideration to the papers prepared by FIMI, which provided comparative analyses of the mineral policies and statutes of other major mineral producing countries in the world such as Australia, Canada, Chile, and South Africa. Legislation The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act, 1957 was enacted so as to provide for the regulation of mines and development of minerals under the control of the Union. The Act has been amended in 1972, 1986, 1994, 1999 and 2004 in keeping with changes in the policy on mineral development. It has been recently amended in 2016 to make fundamental changes. Legislative reform Since that the existing law had already been amended several times and as further amendments may not clearly reflect the objects and reasons emanating from the new Mineral Policy, Government decided to reformulate the legislative framework in the light of the National Mineral Policy, 2008 and consequently, the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill was drafted in 2009-10 by the then Secretary Mines, S. Vijay Kumar,https://www.teriin.org/profile/s-vijay-kumar in consultation with the stakeholders. Government then constituted a Group of Ministers, chaired by the Minister of Finance (comprising Ministers of Home, Environment & Forest, Mines, Steel, Coal, Tribal Affairs, Law etc.) which harmonized the views of the Ministries and the final draft as approved by the Cabinet in September 2011, was introduced in Parliament in November 2011. The Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Bill, 2011, inter alia, provides for the following, namely * A simple and transparent mechanism with clear and enforceable timelines for grant of mining lease or prospecting licence through competitive bidding in areas of known mineralization, and on the basis of first-in-time in areas where mineralization is not known. * \\"Extension\\" rather than \\"renewal\\" of concession to ensure complete exploitation of mineral deposit. * Facilitating easy transfer of reconnaissance and prospecting licences; mining leases are also transferable but subject to prior approval of State Government. A notable feature of the Bill is to provide a simple mechanism which ensures that revenues from mining are shared with local communities at individual as well as community level so as to empower them, provide them with choices, enable them to create and maintain local infrastructure and better utilize infrastructure and other services provided for their benefit. The Bill after introduction in Parliament in November 2011, was referred to the Department‚Äìrelated Parliamentary Standing Committee (\\"Standing Committee\\" ) which after eliciting the views of all stakeholders, submitted its Report. Elections in 2014, however led to the Bill lapsing, and the new NDA Government used its majority to effect amendments in the MMDR Act. The most important amendment has been to make auctions the only way to get mineral concessions at prospecting and mining stages. Some auctions have been held, but the industry view seems to be that auctions are likely to lead to delays and supply interruptions, and that the auction is adding to the burden of taxes on mining. Auctions at mining lease stage are also disincentivising exploration by private sector.https://www.teriin.org/sites/default/files/2019-09/exploration-mining- india.pdf Mining within a sustainable development framework The Hoda Committee made important recommendations on the need for a Sustainable Development Framework (SDF), as follows: \\"\\"The Ministry of Mines and MOEF should jointly set up a working group to prepare a SDF specially tailored to the context of India‚Äôs mining environment, taking fully into account the work done and being done in ICMM and the IUCN. The Indian SDF principles, reporting initiatives, and good practice guidelines unique to the three sectors in Indian mining, i.e. SME, captive, and large stand alone, can then be made applicable to mining operations in India and a separate structure set up to ensure adherence to such framework, drawing from both IBM and the field formations of MOEF. ‚Ä¢ The aspect of social infrastructure in the form of schools, hospitals, drinking water arrangements, etc. needs to be addressed within a formalised framework on the lines of the ICMM model. The Samatha ruling requiring mining companies to spend a set percentage of their profits on model programmes for meeting local needs through a pre-determined commitment, is one option for the country as a whole. Another option could be to require the mining companies to spend a percentage, say three per cent, of their turnover on the social infrastructure in the villages around the mining area. The working group mentioned in paragraph 3.11 may take this into consideration when preparing the Indian SDF and determine the percentage that mining companies could be advised to set aside. \\" Based on these recommendations, the National Mineral Policy 2008 explicitly underlined the need for mining within a sustainable development framework. The National Mineral Policy 2008 states, ( para numbers in brackets are the para numbers in the Policy): \\" (2.3) A framework of sustainable development will be designed which takes care of biodiversity issues and to ensure that mining activity takes place along with suitable measures for restoration of the ecological balance...\\" In para 7.10 it states\\" Extraction of minerals closely impacts other natural resources like land, water, air and forest. The areas in which minerals occur often have other resources presenting a choice of utilisation of the resources. Some such areas are ecologically fragile and some are biologically rich. It is necessary to take a comprehensive view to facilitate the choice or order of land use keeping in view the needs of development as well as the needs of protecting the forests, environment and ecology... All mining shall be undertaken within the parameters of a comprehensive Sustainable Development Framework... Mining operations shall not ordinarily be taken up in identified ecologically fragile areas and biologically rich areas. Para 7.11 states that \\"Appropriate compensation will form an important aspect of the Sustainable Development Framework mentioned in para 2.3 and 7.10‚Ä¶\\" Para 7.12 states that: \\"Once the process of economical extraction of a mine is complete there is need for scientific mine closure which will not only restore ecology and regenerate biomass but also take into account the socio-economic aspects of such closure...\\" And not least, para 3.2 of the Policy states that \\"The Central Govt in consultation with the State Govts shall formulate the legal measures for giving effect to the NMP 2008..The MMDR Act, MCR and MCDR will be amended in line with the policy‚Ä¶\\" In line with the Hoda Committee recommendations, the Ministry of Mines commissioned ERM which prepared a Sustainable Development Framework Report in November 2011.

Khmer sculpture refers to the stone sculpture of the Khmer Empire, which ruled a territory based on modern Cambodia, but rather larger, from the 9th to the 13th century. The most celebrated examples are found in Angkor, which served as the seat of the empire. Styles There are several recognisable specific art styles of the Angkorian period: # Kulen style (c.825-875) # Koh Ker style (941-944) # Baphuon style (1010-1080) # Angkor Wat style (1100-1175) # Bayon style (late 12th to early 13th century) Movement away from Indian models Apsara carving at Angkor Wat. Earlier Khmer art were influenced by Indian influences of Hindu themes. By the 7th century, Khmer sculpture begins to drift away from its Hindu influences ‚Äì pre- Gupta for the Buddhist figures, Pallava for the Hindu figures ‚Äì and through constant stylistic evolution, it comes to develop its own originality, which by the 10th century can be considered complete and absolute. An example of Khmer style that totally departed from Indian sculpture tradition is the wholeness of its figure, which bears similarities to the ancient Egyptian sculpture. Unlike almost all of Indian and Javanese Hindu-Buddhist stone sculptures, which were carved in high reliefs, slabs or supported by stelae on the figure's back, Khmer sculpture is carved wholly in the round. Khmer stone sculpture did not employ any stelae on the back of the figure to support it, as the result broken arms, hands or ankles vividly attested to the vulnerability of this format. Nevertheless, Khmer sculptors seems to wish their works to be seen from all sides in the garbagriha in the center of the temple. Khmers attempted to make free-standing statues, supported by an arch or by an attribute of the divinity such as a piece of clothing or a hand-held object. Khmer sculpture soon goes beyond religious representation, which becomes almost a pretext in order to portray court figures in the guise of gods and goddesses. But furthermore, it also comes to constitute a means and end in itself for the execution of stylistic refinement, like a kind of testing ground. We have already seen how the social context of the Khmer kingdom provides a second key to understanding this art. But we can also imagine that on a more exclusive level, small groups of intellectuals and artists were at work, competing among themselves in mastery and refinement as they pursued a hypothetical perfection of style. The gods we find in Khmer sculpture are those of the two great religions of India, Buddhism and Hinduism. Priests supervised the execution of the works, attested to in the high iconographic precision of the sculptures. Nonetheless, unlike those Hindu images which repeat an idealized stereotype, these images are treated with great realism and originality because they depict living models: the king and his court. The true social function of Khmer art was, in fact, the glorification of the aristocracy through these images of the gods embodied in the princes. In fact, the cult of the ‚Äúdeva-raja‚Äù required the development of an eminently aristocratic art in which the people were supposed to see the tangible proof of the sovereign‚Äôs divinity, while the aristocracy took pleasure in seeing itself ‚Äì if, it‚Äôs true, in idealized form ‚Äì immortalized in the splendour of intricate adornments, elegant dresses and extravagant jewelry. Relief from Angkor The sculptures are images of gods, royal and imposing presences with feminine sensuality, giving impressions of figures at the courts with considerable power. The sculptures represent the chosen divinity in the orthodox manner and succeeds in portraying, with great skill and expertise, high figures of the courts in all of their splendour, in the attire, adornments and jewelry of a sophisticated beauty. But if we go beyond this initial impression, we can pause to observe some of the details of the sculptures, such as the double arc drawn by the eyebrows on the foreheads, evoked below by the wisely sketched curve of the noses and further down, by the double arc which masterfully outlines the lips and the double chin. Following a hypothetical vertical line down still further, we find another double arc outlining the breasts, and then, continuing down from the waist all along the skirts and ending in the ankles, we find almost at the bottom, a twisted double arc intended to represent the other side of the skirts. This detail serves, above all, to eliminate a certain hieratic fixedness, which was relatively common in the Khmer statues of lesser quality. Archeological exploration Elegant roof carvings at Banteay Srei. Ever since 1864, when France established a Protectorate in Cambodia, Western travellers have been amazed by the impressive ruins of Angkor. Not long after, once the √âcole fran√ßaise d'Extr√™me-Orient began to study and catalogue the findings made at the excavations, the growing number of scholars from all around the world, art lovers and admirers of this sculpture, became fervent proponents of Khmer Art. ‚ÄúKhmer Art, captivating in its civility, refinement and delight, open to all forms of life, is made in the image of the country and its inhabitants. Nevertheless, among the arts of the Far East, few are as accessible to the Western temperament. Its profound beauty impresses itself upon the spirit and sensibility without requiring prior study. Its sobriety, its horror of excess and its sense of balance and harmony allow it to attain universal value.‚Äù Thus wrote Madeleine Giteau, the distinguished member of the √âcole fran√ßaise d‚ÄôExtr√™me-Orient, in the introduction to her book Les Khmers in 1965. Currently, the largest museums of the West dedicate entire halls to Khmer sculpture, not to mention the enormous exhibition which took place first at the Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais in Paris and later at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1997.

During World War II, he worked on the German nuclear energy project. After the war, he was on the staff of the Max Planck Institute for Physics in G√∂ttingen. From 1950 to 1974, he was an ordinarius professor of physics at the University of Heidelberg, where he fostered the use of nuclear physics in environmental physics; this led to the founding of the Institute of Environmental Physics in 1975. During 1956 and 1957, he was a member of the Nuclear Physics Working Group of the German Atomic Energy Commission. From 1970 to 1975, he was the Scientific and Technical Managing Director of the Karlsruhe Research Center. Haxel was a signatory of the Manifesto of the G√∂ttingen Eighteen. Education From 1927 to 1933, Haxel studied at the Technische Hochschule M√ºnchen (today, the Technische Universit√§t M√ºnchen) and the Eberhard-Karls-Universit√§t T√ºbingen. He received his doctorate in 1933, under Hans Geiger at the University of T√ºbingen. From 1933 to 1936, Haxel was Geiger‚Äôs teaching assistant there, and he completed his Habilitation in 1936.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Haxel. Career In 1936, Geiger, as the successor to Gustav Hertz, became an ordinarius professor and department head at the Technische Hochschule Berlin (today, the Technische Universit√§t Berlin, in Berlin-Charlottenburg. Haxel also went to the Technische Hochschule Berlin and became a teaching assistant there in 1936 and a lecturer in 1939. It was in 1940 that Haxel met a future collaborator, Fritz Houte, who, through the auspices of Max von Laue, had been released that year from Gestapo incarceration.Powers, 1993, 93.Hentschel and Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F; see the entry for Houtermans. From at least 1940 to early 1942, Haxel worked on the German nuclear energy project, also called the Uranverein (Uranium Club). He specialized in studies of neutron absorption in uranium (see, for example, the Internal Reports below authored with Helmut Volz, also a former student of Geiger). Haxel was called up for military service in early 1942. He was put in charge of a group doing nuclear research for the German Navy under Admiral Rhein, who had formerly been a submarine commander.Powers, 1993, 324-325.

The force of the water caused one of the supporting piers for the brick-built bridge to collapse across the brook. The collapse began on 23 October while engineers were repairing the damaged foundations; a crack was noticed along the structure minutes before it collapsed. The bridge's collapse caused great disruption to local residents of Sheinton who faced inconvenient diversions to commute to and from the county town of Shrewsbury. However, Shropshire County Council acted quickly and a temporary road bridge and approaches were built in the fields alongside the old bridge. The damage caused to the old bridge was so extensive that repairing it was not an option.New Civil Engineer, Retrieved 30 April 2012 The two-pier bridge was listed, therefore it had to be redesigned in the same style, using the same type of materials, and listed building consent had to be obtained.

The name probably derives from the Old Norse scolpvik, or 'Scolp Bay' (a scolp being a large Hebridean vessel, probably relating to the nearby bay where such boats may have landed). It was built in about 1830 by Dr Alexander MacLeod, who was the factor of the North Uist estate. It was erected to provide employment for the purpose of famine relief. Built over an Iron Age dun on a small islet in Loch Scolpaig, the Gothic-style folly has an octagonal footprint and appears as a two-storey structure surmounted by a crenellated parapet. The tower is surrounded by a low stone wall that was probably constructed at the same time. The original dun has disappeared entirely. Today the tower is open to the elements and serves as a nesting place for birds. It was included in the Ninth Report and Inventory of Monuments and Constructions in the Outer Hebrides, Skye and the Small Isles (1928) of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland. In Historic Scotland approved it as a Category B listed building in 1971, however this was withdrawn in 2018 as part of the Dual Designation 2A project though the site continues to be protected as part of a scheduled monument. Scolpaig Tower is located at OS Grid Reference NF73107503. When the water level is sufficiently low, it can be reached via a stone causeway in Loch Scolpaig. The tower is a prominent feature on otherwise flat ground and is among the most photographed sites on the island. A group organised by the Council for Scottish Archaeology under its Adopt-a-Monument scheme was in 2008 attempting to raise funds to stabilise and conserve the structure.

History FBW gained an excellent reputation for the top-level engineering and the long-lasting life of its products, never producing series but instead making individually tailored vehicles. It used only components of its own manufacture, a costly system that allowed the company to produce only a few hundred units per year. Notable designs from FBW included the underfloor- engined trucks, in production since 1949.

Ancient Celtic festivals included religious and seasonal events such as bonfires, harvest festivals, storytelling and music festivals, and dance festivals. This list includes Celtic festivals held throughout the world. History There are several specific and often ancient types of Celtic festivals. A feis (plural feiseannan) is a traditional Gaelic arts and culture festival, currently used referring to Irish dance competitions. In Ancient Ireland communities placed great importance on local festivals, where Gaels could come together in song, dance, music, theatre and sport. Today the Feis has experienced something of a rebirth, both for ethnic Gaels and for enthusiasts of the Gaelic culture in Ireland and Scotland, and worldwide.Feiseanna for dummies : a comprehensive explanation of the basics of feiseanna Other ancient festivals include the eisteddfod, which is a Welsh festival of literature, music and performance dating back to at least the 12th century. The present- day format owes much to an eighteenth-century revival arising out of a number of informal eisteddfodau. Comparable to the eisteddfod but without the ancient roots, the mod is a festival of Scottish Gaelic song, arts and culture. There are both local mods and an annual national mod, the Royal National Mod, which take the form of formal competitions, with choral events and traditional music including fiddle, bagpipe and folk groups. There are spoken word events, original dramas, and competitions in written literature. The concept of modern Celtic identity evolved during the course of the 19th-century into the Celtic Revival and the growth of Celtic nations. After World War II, the focus of the Celticity movement shifted to linguistic revival and protectionism, e.g. protecting Celtic languages. The Celtic revival also led to the emergence of musical and artistic styles identified as Celtic. Music typically drew on folk traditions within the Celtic nations, and instruments such as Celtic harp. Art drew on decorative styles associated with the ancient Celts and with early medieval Celtic Christianity, along with folk-styles. Cultural events to promote \\"inter-Celtic\\" cultural exchange also emerged, including festivals.

Buttonwoods is delimited by Nausauket and Apponaug to the west, Buttonwoods Cove to the north, Greenwich (aka Cowesett) Bay to the south and Oakland Beach to the east. The Old Buttonwoods section of Warwick was founded as a summer colony in 1871 by the Rev. Moses Bixby of Providence's Cranston Street Baptist Church, who was looking for a place to establish a summer colony by the shore for his congregation. He envisioned a community that would be similar to Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, where the Methodists established a summer campground in 1835. Today, this coastal neighborhood on Greenwich Bay is home to people from many different religious backgrounds. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. History Prior to locating to Cranston, RI in 1870, Moses Bixby spent ten years as a Christian missionary in Burma and Siam. He founded the First Shan Church in Toungoo, Burma in 1862 among the Tai people there (the Shan). This church has survived until modern times and is doing well. As of 2009, there are currently 92 Shan churches attributed to his efforts to build the First Missionary To The Shan Of Burma Bixby and his fellow missionaries met with the King of Siam in 1862 and obtained his blessing to teach English to the Shan living in that kingdom. This was the year that Anna Leonowens was introduced to the king and became his Royal governess and English teacher. Local folklore attributes Bixby to have been the facilitator of that engagement documented in the book called Anna and The King of Siam. Missionary records show that Mr. Bixby's assistant was Miss A. R. (Anna) Gage, Bixby's wife's sister. She stayed in Burma and founded a girls school there in 1873 to teach the Burmese girls the English language. Anna Gage stayed in Burma for many years giving Moses Bixby a family connection to his former mission.See The Baptist Missionary Magazine, Volume XLVII, Page 272, American Baptist Missionary Union, published in 1867and The Golden Jubilee Report When Bixby arrived in Cranston, he linked up with Lodowick Brayton. Brayton was a successful industrialist and investor who bought the old Friends (Quaker) Meeting House, said to be the first church in Cranston, in 1866. He set up a Sunday school in the building. This was also the location of the first May Breakfast in Rhode Island established one year later by Mrs. Ruby King to raise money for a new church.See Lodowick Brayton and the first May BreakfastThe Life and Works of Moses Bixby Jeannie Bixby Johnson, Silver Burdett and Company, 1904,The Life and Works of Moses Bixby, Jeannie Bixby Johnson, Silver Burdett and Company, 1904 shows that Bixby founded the Cranston Street Baptist Church in November, 1870, upon his return from Burma. Bixby expanded Brayton's Sunday school into a church of 50 or so members and relocated to Cranston Street. Within a year, three investors acting as trustees, Lodowick Brayton, The Rev. Jonathan Brayton, and Andrew Comstock purchased the Buttonwoods campground in Warwick for $10,000.Town of Warwick land records, Book 37-B, Pages 141 through 144, December 4, 1871 An early plat of the campgrounds shows the laying out of 1,026 lots on of land and a large tabernacle.

In A Walking Tour of Buttonwoods Beach, written by Robert O. Jones of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission, he reports that the ‚Äúshore bordering the Greene Farms at Nassauket (actually Baker‚Äôs Creek) became a popular destination for excursions. Travelers came by steamboat or by wagon overland from the Apponaug train depot. The western boundary of the site is a road, now called Andrew Comstock Road, that may have been used since colonial times by the James Greene Family from their house described as one of Warwick's oldest houses, the road running southerly down to the bay and the site of a landing hooking up this section of Warwick with Potowomut where several other members of the extended Greene family lived. Another colonial road, now called Buttonwoods Avenue, ran easterly from the James Greene house to other Greene property in Old Buttonwoods. In the 1830s the Kinnecom family, a group registered with the Narragansett Indian Tribe,T.F. Green Runway Expansion Environmental Impact Study, Kinnecom Native Historic Cemetery Notes, Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission started to hold clambakes on the Greene property, the earliest-known effort to make a commercial success of what had been a long-standing Rhode Island social and culinary tradition. The vicinity was also a favored place for church outings. William Henry Harrison held a political rally here during his historic presidential campaign. The Kinnecom family hosted over 10,000 people for this event. The area was first called Buttonwoods at this time, named for the many buttonwood trees that once grew here.‚ÄùA Walking Tour of Buttonwoods Beach, written by Robert O. Jones of the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission This site remained popular with the public down until the 1938 Hurricane with people taking trolleys from Providence or driving in from Apponaug and paying daily fees to enjoy the beach. Just how popular the Buttonwoods destination was for the public in the 1880s is made clear in a representation to the Warwick Town Council by John G. Bissell and others regarding the ‚ÄúRoad used by Buttonwood Beach Ass‚Äôn for Horse railroad‚Äù on October 18, 1881. Apparently this railroad was being torn up at that time. Bissell and others quitclaimed their interest in this road so that it might continue to be ‚Äúused by thousands for a carriage road.‚Äù Even in the old days there were traffic jams on the roads to the shore, it seems.This report can be found in the Town of Warwick, Town Council Proceedings, Book 8, Page 154 The plan for the Buttonwoods site now located at the Rhode Island Historical Society in Providence called for 1,000 or so land parcels to be sold to Baptists from around the region.Rhode Island Historical Society Archives Map Room Lodowick joined with his brother Jonathan and with Andrew Comstock to secure the $10,000 in financing for this enterprise. This would be the equivalent of hundreds of millions in today's dollars, a large real estate development. Much of the cash investment came from the Brayton family (railroaders and steel dealers and investor in the Colvin loom.History of the state of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations: Biographical NY: The American Historical Society, Inc. 1920 The Panic of 1873 set in shortly after this investment was made and few lots were actually sold for many years. The campgrounds were resurveyed in 1882 into much larger lots, many of remained unsold and were combined into a large tract of open space in recent years. Brayton died a rich man but his fortunes were much diminished in the real estate deflation that followed the panic. History of Rhode Island Manufacturers Andrew Comstock, a beef shipper and merchant in Providence and founder of the Hammond Beef and Provision Company of Hammond, Indiana, Chicago and Omaha was the other significant investor. He remained a very rich man throughout his life. His Providence operation was located at a rail siding in what is now the Roger Williams National Memorial Park where the original Providence colony was established.New England Families, William Richard Cutter, Lewis Historical Publishing Company, NY, NY, 1915 The Hammond Beef companies along with several refrigerator rail car companies along with Armour and Company, Gustavus Swift, and Morris Beef Company were the subject of the \\"Beef Trust\\" trial of 1910. See Industries and Wealth of the Principal Points in Rhode Island The main interest of these partners was to develop a rail link from Providence to the shore, with Buttonwoods as the terminus. First a horse railway was established and then steam trains were introduced. This then became the Suburban Railroad servicing Rocky Point, Oakland Beach, and Buttonwoods. It was wiped out in the 1938 hurricane. Description This residential neighborhood is small, about 170 houses, and most of the houses are historic, with many Victorian cottages and larger shingled bungalows in the Arts and Crafts style. The waterfront along Promenade Avenue has many mature trees in their streets. Many of the original cottages have disappeared over the years, including the cottage at Buttonwoods Point, torn down in the 1980s, and the Moses Bixby cottage, which, except for the roof peak on the West side, was torn down during the real estate boom of the 2000s. These were two of the original cottages at the beach of seemingly historic value. The above-mentioned A Walking Tour of Buttonwoods Beach, written by Robert O. Jones, documents a few original cottages that survive to this day including the Smith S. Sweet house at 1078 Buttonwoods Avenue and a cottage at 12 12th Avenue which was also in the Sweet family. A cottage at 5 13th Avenue, across from the location of the original Moses Bixby house, built in 1872, was also leveled during the real estate boom of the 2000s upon the death of the former owner who had lived there for much of the 20th Century. Across Buttonwoods Cove, although not part of Old Buttonwoods, is Warwick City Park, which includes three baseball fields, picnic areas and shelters, three miles (5 km) of paved bicycle paths, and tennis courts among other amenities. Abutting Old Buttonwoods directly to the west is Budlong Farm, on which land is located the summer colony of the Buttonwoods Campers Association, established around the turn of the 20th century. The Budlong/Greene families were among the original colonists and founders of Warwick, Rhode Island, along with the Gorton, Lippitt and Potter families et al. The Greenes owned a huge portion of the Nausauket neck, which was divided up among the generations of Budlong/Greene heirs. The original Greene/Budlong farm homestead, built in 1776, still stands today and can be seen from Buttonwoods Avenue. Over time, tracts of land were sold off, among them, the tract sold to the Buttonwoods Beach Association (see above, purchase of land by Lodowick Brayton, The Rev. Jonathan Brayton, and Andrew Comstock). When Henry Warner Budlong inherited what remained of the Greene family lands, he was approached to establish a summer colony similar to that of Buttonwoods Beach, but dedicated to middle-class families. At that time the Buttonwoods Campgrounds was established (circa 1899) allowing families to erect long tents (said to have been army surplus from the Civil War) and spend summers on the shore of Greenwich Bay. Henry Warner Budlong, whose memorial building sits next to Warwick City Hall in Apponaug, was a bachelor with no heirs. In his last will and testament, Budlong bequeathed the majority of his material assets to his housekeeper, Emily I. Hohler. The Buttonwoods Campers Association, currently consisting of 120 cottages, continued uninterrupted to lease the land. Budlong's will drawn up in 1928 (he died in 1929) specified that upon Mrs. Hohler's passing, the Budlong Farm land would not pass to her heirs, but would go to the Metropolitan Park Commission of the State of RI to be made into a memorial park named The Greene Park after his mother, Rhody Knight Greene. When Mrs. Hohler died Oct. 31, 1964, the Hohler daughters, Alice Hohler and Hope Maynard joined with the summer resident \\"campers\\" to contest the Budlong will. One camper, William McCaughey Jr., was key in obtaining a stay of the state's possession by then-governor John Chafee, who said the campers could remain on the contested land until a solution had been reached. The Hohler/Maynard families, with financial support from the summer residents, purchased an identical tract of waterfront land which was given to the state (and then the City of Warwick) to satisfy the Budlong will. That land was added to other land the City of Warwick owned, and became Warwick City Park. Association The Buttonwood Beach Association was incorporated in 1872 by a special act of the Rhode Island General Assembly. The trustees passed control of the running of the property to the Association. The Association then platted out public streets and started selling lots to individuals, an activity that irrevocably dedicates the streets as public highways. It has recently claimed that the streets are no longer public and is advocating for the privatization of the entire subdivision through the elimination of the Buttonwoods Fire District, a quasi-municipality that maintains the streets and public areas in the plat. In David Clark v Buttonwoods Beach Association (2020) the Rhode Island Supreme Court found that Dr. Clark did not establish an adequate adverse possession claim for a part of Promenade Avenue, a Fire District street. Many deeds include the provision that owners must first offer their property back to the association in the event of a sale. The Buttonwood Beach Association now organizes activities and celebrations for residents, many held at the Buttonwooods Fire District-owned building called the Casino. The Casino has a stage and two bowling alleys. Tennis courts and a playground are nearby. Potluck dinners, seasonal parties, and arts and crafts lessons for children take place there. Fire District residents and others can use the hall for private parties. The Buttonwood Beach Association owns a nondenominational chapel at Ninth Avenue and Janice Road. The Buttonwoods Fire District will celebrate its 100-year anniversary in 2025. Originally chartered by the General Assembly to maintain the streets from Cooper Road easterly, its reach was expanded in the 1980s to include the streets from Andrew Comstock Road easterly to the Buttonwoods Point. Included in that expansion is the adoption by the General Assembly of the 1882 plat map as the inventory of Buttonwoods Fire District streets. The streets are maintained by the Fire District under a perpetual lease agreement with the Beach Association. The Beach Association has adopted the position that the lease makes the streets private and the Fire District is exploring its disbandment in favor of a non-profit Home Owners Association which would pay Warwick city taxes on all streets making them private. Today, the Buttonwoods Campers Association, Inc. continues to lease lands (about 25 acres) from the Hohler/Maynard families. The association members have a community hall where various social functions and activities are held for the benefit of residents of all ages. The association has made capital improvements, including a basketball court, soft sand volleyball court, bocce court and playground. Despite considerable erosion of its once pristine beach (due directly to the FEMA-financed construction of a massive seawall to protect Old Buttonwoods' shoreline) the summer community continues to be populated by families with youngsters and by snowbird seniors. The entire Budlong Farm sits on about 60 acres. A good portion is used to grow corn by Confreda Farms. Recently, the land was put under the Rhode Island Farm, Forest, and Open Space Act, with a pledge not to be developed. It remains a bucolic snapshot of colonial times and of the late Victorian era.

Designated by the state as sites RI-1072 through RI-1079, this discontiguous cluster of sites has the potential to increase knowledge of prehistoric patterns of stone tool procurement, development, and use. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, primarily for its potential to yield further information. Background The district includes eight discontiguous archaeological sites, located in the generally vicinity of Carbuncle Hill, located in far western Coventry, Rhode Island. These sites were identified in 1983 during a systematic archaeological survey of western Rhode Island, and all were subjected to shovel pit testing. The Carbuncle Hill area is judged to be desirable for prehistoric stone workers due to the presence of raw materials nearby, as well as having favorable conditions for subsistence hunting. None of the sites identified yielded datable materialMcBride, Kevin (June 1985). National Register nomination for Carbuncle Hill Archaeological District; available by request from the National Park Service Sites RI-1072 is a small site at which a single quartz flake was found. It is located adjacent to an outcropping containing raw quartz, and is assumed to be a site where activity was limited to the extraction of raw material. RI-1073 is a larger area with significant debitage, suggesting it is an area where raw materials where tools were manufactured and repaired. It has three distinct areas where work took place. RI-1074 is a small site at which a number of quartzite materials were found, including a quarry block weighing 30 to 50 pounds. RI-1075 is also a small site, at which primarily shattered stone remnants were found. This is an indication that fine edge production did not take place here; it may have been where larger chunks of raw material were reduced (to \\"good\\" material) for ease of transport. RI-1076 is one of the district's largest sites, and its finds suggest a diversity of activities took place there. It may have been a short-term camp site at which subsistence activities took place, in addition to activities specifically geared toward tool production. RI-1077, RI-1078, and RI-1079 all appear to have been tool- making areas similar to RI-1073, but smaller. RI-1077 is the only site at which a marine shell fragment was found.

Some are four-sided‚Äîrectangular, square and irregular‚Äîwhile others are circular. In size they vary from a few square metres (some square feet) to over . Pounds are known to date from the medieval period. By the 16th century most villages and townships would have had a pound. Most of what remain today would date from the 16th and 17th centuries.

Mandaviya. Maritime transport is a critical infrastructure for the social and economic development of a country. It represents the pace, structure and pattern of development of water transport in the country. The Ministry of Shipping encompasses the shipping and port sectors which include shipbuilding and repair, major ports, national waterways and inland water transport. The ministry has been entrusted with the responsibility to formulate policies and programmes on these subjects and their implementation.  History  In July 1942, the Department of Communications was split into two departments, the Department of Posts and the Department of War Transport. The Department of War Transport included major ports, railways, roads, water transport, petrol rationing and producer gas. Its functions were to manage transportation during wartime. Coastal shipping and the management and expansion of major ports were also added to the portfolio. Exports were given priority in the department. = Changes over the years = After the independence of India in 1947, various governments have reorganized and renamed the department. *1957: \\"Department of War Transport\\" was renamed as \\"Ministry of Transport & Communications\\". *1966: On 25 January, under President's order the \\"Department of Transport, Shipping & Tourism\\" was placed under \\"Ministry of Transport and Aviation\\". *1967: On 13 March, the \\"Ministry of Transport and Aviation\\" was split into two as the \\"Ministry of Shipping and Transport\\" and the \\"Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation\\". *1985: On 25 September, with the reorganization, the \\"Ministry of Transport and Shipping\\" became the \\"Department of Surface Transport under the Ministry of Transport\\". *1986: On 22 October, the \\"Department of Surface Transport under Ministry of Transport\\" was renamed as \\"Ministry of Surface Transport\\". *1999: On 15 October, \\"Ministry of Surface Transport\\" was afterwards reorganized into two as \\"Department of Shipping\\" and the \\"Department of Road Transport and Highways\\". *2000: On 17 November, the \\"Ministry of Surface Transport\\" was bifurcated into two different ministries as \\"Ministry of Shipping\\" and \\"Ministry of Road Transport and Highways\\". *2004: On 2 October, \\"Ministry of Shipping\\" and \\"Ministry of Road Transport and Highways\\" were again merged and renamed as \\"Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways\\". It had two departments; \\"Department of Shipping\\" and \\"Department of Road transport and Highways\\".  Organisational setup  * The Secretary (Shipping) is assisted by Joint Secretaries (Shipping, Ports), Development Advisor (Ports), Chief Controller of charting and other officers at the level of directors, deputy secretaries, under secretaries and other secretariat and technical officers. * The Accounts wing is headed by a Chief Controller of Accounts who is inter alia responsible for accounting, payment, budget, internal audit and cash management. * Advisor (Transport Research) renders necessary data support to various wings of the Ministry for policy planning, transport co-ordination, economic and statistical analysis on various modes of transport with which the ministry is concerned. The following are autonomous organisations, societies and PSUs functioning under the administrative control of the ministry: = Subordinate/attached offices = * Directorate General of Shipping, Mumbai * Andaman and Lakshadweep Harbour Works, Port Blair * Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships, New Delhi * Minor Ports Survey Organisation, Mumbai = Autonomous bodies = * Chennai Port Trust * Cochin Port Trust * Inland Waterways authority of India, Noida * Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust * Kandla Port Trust * Mumbai Port Trust * National Shipping Board * New Mangalore Port Trust * Paradip Port Trust * Kolkata Port Trust * Seamen's Provident Fund Organisation, Mumbai * Tariff Authority of Major Ports, Mumbai * V.O.Chidambarnar Port Trust * Visakhapatnam Port Trust * Indian Maritime University = Societies and associations = * Indian Ports Association * Seafarers Welfare Fund Society = PSUs = * Central Inland Water Transport Corporation Limited * Cochin Shipyard Limited, Cochin * Dredging Corporation of India Limited * Ennore Port Limited * Hooghly Dock & Port Engineers Limited * Sethusamundaram Corporation Limited * Shipping Corporation of India, Mumbai * Indian Port Rail & Ropeway Corporation of India  Statistics  India currently ranks 16th among the maritime countries with a coastline of 7,517 km with 13 major ports (12 government and one corporate) and about 200 non-major ports currently operating in the western and eastern regions of the country. According to the ministry 95% of India's trade by volume and 70% by value occurs through maritime transport. = Market size = Cargo traffic of Indian ports were 911.5 MT for FY12, and was projected to be around 1,758 MT for FY17. During April‚ÄìMay 2014 ports handled 95.87 MT of cargo as compared to 91.48 MT during April‚ÄìMay 2013, an increase of 4.8%, according to the data released by Indian Ports Association (IPA). Of the major ports, Mormugao Port posted highest growth in traffic (24.48%) during April and May 2014, followed by Mumbai Port (14.35%), Kamarajar Port (13.90%), V.O. Chidambaranar Port (13.67%) and Kolkata Dock System (12.36%) as compared to the same period the previous year. In terms of volume, Kandla port led the pack with 15.31 MT of traffic handled followed by Paradip port at 11.73 MT during the same period. In 2013‚Äì14, coal cargo traffic (thermal coal and coking coal) volumes rose by 20.6 per cent to 104.5 MT from 86.7 MT a year previously. Among commodities, there was an increase of 25 per cent in handling of fertilizers in April 2014 in comparison to April 2013. Iron ore handling also showed an increase of 16.8 per cent during the month. = Investments = The Indian ports sector received FDI worth US$1,635.40 million between April 2000 and May 2014, according to the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP), Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The ports sector in India were awarded 30 projects in 2013-14 entailing an investment of over Rs 20,000 crore (US$3.32 billion), marking a threefold increase over the preceding year. The following are major investments and developments in the sector: * Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone has signed an agreement with L&T; Infrastructure and Tata Steel to acquire 100% stake in DPCL for rupees 5000 crore(US$915.17 million) * JNPT and PSA have signed a concession agreement for the Port's fourth container terminal worth Rs 8,000 crore (US$1.33 billion). It currently operates container terminals in Kolkata, Tuticorin and Chennai ports, with a total capacity of 2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). The fourth container terminal would have a capacity of 4.8 million TEUs. * Paradip Port plans to set up hybrid cargo terminals - captive-cum-common user facility - as part of its expansion plans. * L&T; Shipbuilding Ltd is diversifying its cargo handling capacity at Katupalli Port to include automobiles and oil products in addition to container handling. Originally, the Katupalli port planned to handle a total of 25 MT of cargo, of which 24 MT was containerised cargo and the rest steel and project cargo.  Government initiatives  The Government has allowed FDI up to 100% under the projects related to the construction and maintenance of ports and harbours. A 10-year tax exemption has been given to the enterprises engaged in the business of developing, maintaining and operating ports, inland waterways and inland ports. The Minister for Road Transport, Highways and Shipping Nitin Gadkari said that his ministry will coordinate with other ministries of Environment & Forests, Tourism, Power and Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation for development of transport and tourism along the river Ganga. The Cochin Steamer Agents Association (CSAA) will take the lead to improve the cargo throughput by organising marketing initiatives in the hinterland in association with the port management, terminal operator and various other stakeholders. A 20 per cent growth target in container volume was fixed for 2014‚Äì15. The National Maritime Agenda 2010-2020 is an initiative of the Ministry of Shipping to outline the framework for the development of the port sector. The agenda also suggests policy-related initiatives to improve the operating efficiency and competitiveness of Indian ports. Sagar Mala project is the new initiative of the ministry.  Future plans  Investments and cargo traffic represent the health of the port services, these include operation and maintenance services such as pilotage, harbouring and provision of marine assets like bargers and dredgers. The Planning Commission of India in its 12th Five Year Plan expects a total investment of Rs 180,626 crore (US$30.05 billion) in the ports sector. Through its Maritime Agenda 2010‚Äì2020, the Ministry of Shipping has set a target capacity of over 3,130 MT by 2020, largely through private sector participation. More than 50 per cent of this capacity is expected to be created at non-major ports. Visakhapatnam port looked forward to a bright year in 2014‚Äì15, as several development projects were on the verge of completion, and the port expected to handle 65 MT of cargo during the year.

Kershisnik (born 1962) is an American painter. He studied art at the University of Utah, Brigham Young University (BYU), and the University of Texas at Austin. He lives in Provo, Utah. One art professor described his style as primitive-realist, and his paintings have a dream-like quality that is focused on idealized human figures. His notable works include a portrait of Leslie Norris, Nativity, and She Will Find What Was Lost. Kershisnik often begins with sketch or title, transforming his ideas into paintings. His work is in the permanent collections of many institutions, including the Brigham Young University Museum of Art, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the Covey Center for the Arts. Early life and education Kershisnik was born in 1962, in Oklahoma City. He is the youngest son of four children and grew up both in the United States and internationally. His father worked as a petroleum geologist, moving internationally with his work. The family lived in various locations around the world, including Angola, Thailand, and Pakistan. He spent his childhood summers in Rock Springs, Wyoming, visiting his grandparents. After graduating high school from the International School of Islamabad, Kershisnik attended the University of Utah intending to study architecture. After a year, he left to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Denmark. He transferred to BYU where he studied art and eventually focused on painting. During his undergraduate studies, he received a grant to study in London for six months. He received his Bachelor of Arts (BA) from BYU in 1988, after which he studied printmaking at the University of Texas at Austin where he received a Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in 1991. Upon the completion of his master's degree, he and his family moved to Kanosh, Utah. Process and style Kershisnik is one of the best-known contemporary Mormon artists, and his work relates the mundane to the divine. He has described his own style as \\"mythological autobiography,\\" or a kind of \\"emotional self-portrait.\\" His paintings often have whimsical or humorous subjects, and he paints in oil in a primitive-realist style, as described by Noel Carmack, an art professor at the Utah State University. Geoff Wichert, an art critic and frequent writer on Kershisnik, writes that Kershisnik's work deals mainly with the human figure as an ideal. The way his complex figures contrast with their unadorned settings gives his paintings a dreamlike quality. Flying is a common theme. Another way that Kershisnik abstracts his figures is by using the frontal eye on profile figures, as in Egyptian and Cubist paintings. He uses unusually large or small objects and textual inscriptions to heighten the otherworldly sense in his paintings. His works engage in a dialogue with religious ideas, showing human struggles and their consequences. Disheveled Saint depicts a scruffy man wearing a T-shirt, showing Kershisnik's belief that ordinary people can be holy. Burden on Wheels depicts two figures in white pushing a large object on wheels, which is pulled by a dark figure. The painting reflects the Christian idea that humans receive divine providence. Kershisnik views art as way to \\"become more human.\\" He uses a sketchbook to illustrate ideas, write down perspective concepts or aspects of a future painting. Often, his works will begin as a title and will illustrate the symbolism or the meaning behind those words. He usually works on numerous paintings at a time, having worked on as many as 100 pieces simultaneously. His approach to figure drawing \\"from [his] imagination rather than models.\\" He is influenced by many artists, but specifically names Chagall, Degas, Modigliani, Klee, Giotto, and the artists that painted in the Lascaux caves. He sums up his artistic philosophy in the following statement: > There is great importance in successfully becoming human, in striving to > fully understand others, ourselves, and God. The process is difficult and > filled with awkward discoveries and happy encounters, dreadful sorrow, and > unmitigated joy sometimes several at once. I believe art should facilitate > this journey, rather than simply decorate it, or worse, distract us from it. > It should remind us of what we have forgotten, illuminate what we know, or > teach us new things. Through art we can come to feel and understand and love > more completely‚Äîwe become more human... I firmly believe that when a > painting succeeds, I have not created it, but rather participated in it. I > paint because I love, and because I love to paint. The better I become at > both, the more readily accessed and identified is this grace, and the better > will be my contribution. Works Leslie Norris's neighbor asked Kershisnik to do a portrait of Norris. Kershisnik agreed to do it and give the neighbor the first chance to buy or refuse the painting. When the portrait was finished, the neighbor did not want to buy the painting, which Kershisnik then sold to the Utah Arts Council in 1994. Norris himself wanted to buy the painting afterwards, but the painting remains in custody of the Utah Arts Council. Part of Kershisnik's Nativity Nativity depicts the birth of Christ. Kershisnik painted Nativity in 2006 while he was a visiting professor at BYU. Kershisnik started the painting to create \\"something ambitious\\", after encouraging his students to do the same. The painting shows Mary nursing the baby Jesus, two midwives, Joseph, and a dog with her pups underneath a concourse of angels. Kershisnik said that his experiences of the births of his own children felt \\"densely witnessed\\" and inspired the painting. He also explained the iconography of the dog as a representation of fidelity and faithfulness, a common symbol in religious art. Bren Jackson, an art critic, wrote that the midwives exemplify the \\"fellowship of sisterhood\\" and Kershisnik adds that he would imagine that there would have been women there to help Mary. In the painting, Joseph is nearby, but separate from Mary and her child, and has an overwhelmed expression. The angels have distinct faces, which according to Jackson, invites viewers to consider what their role in observing the birth could have been. Part of She Will Find What Was Lost She Will Find What Was Lost depicts many angels blessing and looking at a woman, who seems to some viewers to be unaware of their presence. It was on the cover of the February 2017 Ensign, and is on display in the LDS Conference Center as part of the LDS Church's collection. Viewers interpret the painting in different ways; some see it as depicting divine revelation and others see it as showing family history. Of the painting, Kershisnik wrote, \\"My intention for this piece was to speak to the most intensely private and intimate kind of supernatural interference, influence, and assistance... Many unseen forces are interested in you, love you, and work to influence matters for your profound benefit. Most of what we all do is resist it, misinterpret it, or mess it up, but my experience indicates that these unseen efforts persist impossibly. I thank God for that.\\" Criticism In June 2017, the BYU Museum of Art opened the exhibition The Interpretation Thereof: Contemporary LDS Art and Scripture. Kershisnik's work, Descent From the Cross, is included in this exhibition, which Sean Rossiter criticized for depicting Christ too lightly, and as he argues, limiting the emotional weight of Crucifixion of Jesus. In 2011, Geoff Wichert criticised some of Kershisnik symbols as being esoteric and theologically specific. Writing for the Phoenix New Times, Tricia Parker commented that the people in his paintings are emotionally ambiguous because they are literally two-dimensional, but that this ambiguity makes them relatable. Permanent and long-term exhibitions and collections Several institutions display Kershisnik's work permanently or on a long-term basis. These include the Beverly Taylor Sorenson Arts and Education Complex at the University of Utah, the BYU Museum of Art, the Springville Museum of Art, and the Covey Center for the Arts. The collections in Illinois State University and the University of Ohio also include some of his works.

The mill complex consists of a collection of mainly brick buildings, bounded by the Pawtuxet River and Pulaski, Remington, and Manchester Streets in the village of Crompton. The mill complex formerly extended across the river, but the complex on the west bank was destroyed by fire in 1992. The oldest elements of the complex are the dam site and some of the raceways that provided water power to the mills. The present dam was built in 1908, replacing an 1882 structure. The raceways were built in 1807, around the time of the first mill buildings. The stone Mill No. 1, built 1807, is believed to be the oldest stone mill building in the state. Most of the complex's buildings were built in the late 19th and early 20th centuries by the Providence Manufacturing Company and its successors. The mill was used for textile (mainly cotton) processing until 1946, when the Crompton Corporation ended production. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006.

Inscriptions make known a Phrygian town named Motella, which name is connected with the Phrygian feminine proper name Motalis and the Cilician masculine Motales, as also with Mutalli, or Mutallu, the name of an ancient Hittite king of Northern Commagene. One of these inscriptions was found in the village of Medele, which evidently preserves the ancient name. Motella seems to be the town which HieroclesSynecdemus, 668, 6. calls Pulcherianopolis. Ecclesiastical history Motella may be supposed to have been raised to the rank of a bishopric by the Empress Pulcheria (414-53). Shortly before 553, perhaps in 535, the Emperor Justinian raised Hierapolis to metropolitan rank, and attached to it a certain number of suffragan sees previously dependent on Laodicea. Among these the Notitiae Episcopatuum mention, from the ninth to the twelfth or thirteenth century, this same Motella, which they call Metellopolis, and even once Metallopolis. An inscription informs us of Bishop Michael, in 556; and another, of Bishop Cyriacus, perhaps in 667. At the Council of Nicaea in 787, the see was represented by Eudoxius, a priest and monk. Bishop Michael attended the two councils of Constantinople in 869 and 879. The bishopric of Metellopolis is included in the Catholic Church's list of titular sees.Annuario Pontificio 2013 (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, ), p. 929 In 1660 Ignace Cotolendi (1630-62) was appointed titular bishop of Metellopolis (Medele) with jurisdiction over three provinces of northeastern China, Tartary, and Korea.Donald F.

It is responsible for welfare, social justice and empowerment of disadvantaged and marginalised sections of society, including scheduled castes (SC), Other Backward Classes (OBC), the disabled, the elderly, and the victims of drug abuse. The Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment holds cabinet rank as a member of the Council of Ministers. The current minister is Thawar Chand Gehlot, who is assisted by a Minister of State, Rattan Lal Kataria, Krishan Pal Gujjar and Ramdas Athavale. History In the 1985-1986, the former Ministry of Welfare was divided into the Department of Women and Child Development and the Department of Welfare. At the same time, the Scheduled Castes Development Division, Tribal Development Division and the Minorities and Backward Classes Welfare Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Wakf Division of the Ministry of Law left those ministries to form the new Ministry of Welfare. The Ministry of Welfare adopted the name Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment in May 1998. In October 1999, the Tribal Development Division left the ministry to become its own ministry, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. In January 2007, the Minorities Division and the Wakf Unit were moved out of the ministry to form the Ministry of Minority Affairs and the Child Development Division left the ministry to form the Ministry of Women and Child Development. To propagate the ideologies and philosophy of Babu Jagjivan Ram, the 'Babu Jagjivan Ram National Foundation', has been set up by the Ministry. In 2012, the Union Minister of Social Justice and Empowerment launched Oblindia, an online library for visually impaired college students. At launch, the library included 12,000 books in 10 languages.

Philip was close to the president's children and accompanied them on trips. He was a 1912 graduate of Harvard University. He served as the 1914 President of The Harvard Advocate. Military service He was an original member of the Raynal Bolling‚Äôs 1st Aero Company of the New York National Guard. He did not qualify as a military aviator due to his eyesight, but as a military-aviation journalist he was a prominent aerial warfare expert. Immediately after United States Congress declared war on 6 April 1917, the Signal Corps summoned Roosevelt to Washington to help plan the aviation mobilization. He impressed Benjamin Delahauf Foulois and accompanied him to France. Foulois paired Roosevelt with major Bert Atkinson, but they had the command organization that resulted from the American Expeditionary Force‚Äôs inexperience in coalition warfare. They operated under the French Sixth Army, but two different American headquarters (including Colonel Billy Mitchell's 1st Air Brigade headquarters) felt that they held jurisdiction. The two planned America‚Äôs first-ever air-land battle at a time when the US Army was still learning the nuances of command relationships between the pursuit and observation groups and the corps and armies they supported. Personal The Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was certified as ratified on January 29, 1919 and the National Prohibition Act, passed in the United States Congress over United States President Woodrow Wilson's veto on October 28, 1919. In November 1919, during prohibition, Roosevelt served as President of a joint venture with Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., Kermit Roosevelt, Archibald Roosevelt, Ethel Roosevelt Derby and her husband Richard Derby, opening a coffeehouse named the Brazilian Coffeehouse at 108 West 44th Street in Manhattan, New York. The coffeehouse was renamed the Double R, and moved to 112 W. 44th in 1921. It was managed by the Roosevelts until 1928. In 1925, he married his own cousin Jean S. Roosevelt, daughter of John Ellis Roosevelt. Their common great grandfather Cornelius Van Schaak Roosevelt was Theodore Roosevelt's grandfather. He was the son of William Emlen Roosevelt, grandson of James A. Roosevelt and brother of George Emlen Roosevelt and John Kean Roosevelt. He died in November 1941 of drowning, presumably after a heart attack, while sailing a dinghy in Oyster Bay, New York. Family political humor He would later become partner in Roosevelt & Son and supposedly became a trustee of the estate of James Roosevelt, Sr. on behalf of distant cousin and United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt. A Time story of a repartee between cousins in a series of written notes about the effects of fiscal policy and estate interests was very humorous, but denied as false.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of three tracks with a side platforms and an island platform. Grorud is served by the L1 line of the Norwegian State Railways's Oslo Commuter Rail. The station was opened on 1 September 1854 and is one of Norway's nine first stations. The original building, designed by Heinrich Ernst Schirmer and Wilhelm von Hanno, burned down in 1862. It was replaced by the current station in Swiss chalet style, which was completed in 1865. History The station ca. 1920 Grorud was selected as one of nine original station which was built for Norway's first railway, the Trunk Line.Norwegian Trunk Railway: 106 Grorud was selected both because it was at about half-way between Christiania and Lillestr√∏m Station, but also because it had many large farms and sawmills in its vicinity.Bramness: 22 Construction began in 1851.Bramness: 19 It opened on 1 September 1854, jointly as the oldest railway station in Norway.Bjerke & Holom: 54 The station was named for the farm in the area. The original station building was designed by Heinrich Ernst Schirmer and Wilhelm von Hanno, in the same general design as the station at Frogner, Kl√∏ften and Dahl.Hartmann: 106 The station had a major impact on the Grorud area, which at the time was entirely rural. Travel time was forty minutes to Christiania East Station and made transport to the capital easy. The area gradually grew as a population center. The railway line physically divided Groruddalen into two sections, which after the railway line came became known as Grorud and Furuset. Originally the only level crossing of the line between Grorud and Furuset was situated at the station. Grorud Station A fire in 1862 caused the station building to burn down. It was replaced with a new station building in 1865, designed by an unknown architect.Bjerke & Holom: 55 It was built on the same foundation and has many structural similarities as the original station. The upper floor served as a station master's residence. There was also a small house nearby for the clerk and park. By 1867 there were 5,287 passengers taking the train that year from Grorud to Christiania. The area could thereafter gradually establish itself as a suburb and industrial area. The station received an extension in the 1890s,Norwegian Trunk Railway: 122 followed by gas lamps in 1900 and 1901.Norwegian Trunk Railway: 108 An incomplete interlocking system was installed on 1 May 1901. The following years the line between Christiania and Lillestr√∏m was upgraded to double track, which opened past Grorud on 1 October 1903.Bjerke & Holom: 52 Grorud was the only station along the line which, due to the recent upgrades, was large enough that it did not need an expansion. The station and its park Grorud became a more distinct area around the beginning of the 20th century, with a school and a church. The railway past the station was electrified on 1 September 1927. Grorudveien, the road crossing the tracks, was lowered and the railway placed on a bridge over the road in 1938. The station received a complete interlocking system on 26 March 1939. The most intensive construction of housing started in the 1940s. Grorud Station received centralized traffic control on 24 January 1972, allowing it to be unmanned starting 2 June 1991. Facilities The station area Grorud Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. The wooden station building was built in Swiss chalet style, without any contemporary railway buildings in a similar design. The station building is no longer in use, but has been listed as a cultural heritage.Hartmann: 109 The line past Grorud is double track and electrified. The station features two platforms serving three tracks. Closest to the station building is a long side platform serving track 1, while tracks 2 and 3 are served by a common island platform. The platforms have heights of . Track 3 connects to Alnabru Freight Terminal, so east-bound freight trains from there emerge onto the Trunk Line at Grorud. There is an underpass under the station between the two platforms. It has stairs and is not universally accessible. There is a ticket machine at the station, as well as parking for 80 cars. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Grorud with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Lillestr√∏m Station along the Trunk Line past Grorud to Oslo Central Station and then along the Drammen Line to Asker Station before serving the Spikkestad Line and terminating at Spikkestad Station. Grorud has four trains per direction per hour. Travel time is 12 minutes to Oslo Central Station and 17 minutes to Lillestr√∏m.

Jackson, 113 U.S. 332 (1885), was a writ of error brought to reverse a judgment by the court below by Jackson, a relator, who recovered a judgment against the City of Quincy, Illinois, for the sum of $9,546.24, with costs of suit.. Background There were no funds in the city's treasury out of which the judgment could be paid, and its corporate authorities refused to satisfy it, in the only way in which it can be paid, by a levy of taxes for that specific purpose. The judgment in the present action, which was commenced by a petition for mandamus, requires the City Council of Quincy to levy and collect a special tax sufficient to discharge the amount thereof with interest from the date of its rendition and also the costs of this and the former action. We have only to inquire whether the corporate authorities of the city have the power under the laws of Illinois to levy and collect such a tax. It was conceded that the revenue of the city for its fiscal year ending March 31, 1885, to accrue from the taxes it could levy under the act of 1881, after meeting its necessary current expenses and other demands prior to that of the relator Jackson, will be insufficient to pay his judgment interest, and costs. On behalf of the city, it was contended that when these bonds were issued, the act of 1863 prohibited any annual levy of taxes \\"to pay the debts and meet the general expenses of the city\\" in excess of fifty cents on each one hundred dollars of the assessed value of its real and personal property. To this it may be replied, as was done in Quincy v. Cooke in reference to similar language in the original charter of the city, that the act of 1863 related to debts and expenses incurred for ordinary municipal purposes, and not to indebtedness arising from railroad subscriptions, the authority to make which is not implied from any general grant of municipal power, but must be expressly conferred by statute. When the legislature in 1869 legalized and confirmed what the city council had previously done touching the subscription to the stock of the Mississippi and Missouri River Air Line Railroad Company, and thereby authorized bonds in payment thereof to be issued, it could not have been contemplated that indebtedness thus created would be met by such taxation as was permitted for ordinary municipal purposes. In giving authority to incur obligations for such extraordinary indebtedness, the legislature did not restrict its corporate authorities to the limit of taxation provided for ordinary debts and expenses. In Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 660, the Court, after observing that the validity of a contract, which can only be fulfilled by a resort to taxation, depends on the power to levy the tax for that purpose, said: > It is therefore to be inferred that, when the legislature of the state > authorizes a county or city to contract a debt by bond, it intends to > authorize it to levy such taxes as are necessary to pay the debt, unless > there is in the act itself, or in some general statute, a limitation upon > the power of taxation which repels such an inference. Decision So, in United States v. New Orleans, 98 U. S. 381, 98 U. S. 393: > When authority to borrow money or incur an obligation, in order to execute a > public work, is conferred upon a municipal corporation, the power to levy a > tax for its payment, or the discharge of the obligation, accompanies it, and > this too without any special mention that such power is granted. This arises > from the fact that such corporations seldom possess--so seldom, indeed, as > to be exceptional--any means to discharge their pecuniary obligations except > by taxation. The same question arose in Ralls County v. United States, 105 U. S. 735, where it was said: > It must be considered as settled in this Court that when authority is > granted by the legislative branch of the government to a municipality, or a > subdivision of a state, to contract an extraordinary debt by the issue of > negotiable securities, the power to levy taxes sufficient to meet at > maturity the obligations to be incurred is conclusively implied, unless the > law which confers the authority, or some general law in force at the time, > clearly manifests a contrary legislative intention. Again: > If what the law requires to be done can only be done through taxation, then > taxation is authorized to the extent that may be needed, unless it is > otherwise expressly declared. The power to tax in such cases is not an > implied power, but a duty growing out of the power to contract. The one > power is as much express as the other. See also Parkersburg v. Brown, 106 U. S. 501. The doctrine announced in these cases is sustained by United States v. County of Macon, 99 U. S. 582, upon which the plaintiff in error relies; for, in that case, the very act, conferring upon the county authority to make a subscription to the stock of a railroad corporation, made special provision for a tax to meet the subscription, and thus negatived the inference that the legislature intended to permit any taxation beyond that allowed by that special act and the general laws of the state. These decisions covered the present case, for, in the first place, neither the act of 1869, from which the city derived authority to issue negotiable bonds in payment of its subscription, nor any general law of the state, forbids, expressly or by necessary implication, taxation to the extent necessary to meet the obligations thus incurred, and, in the second place, the limitation imposed by the city's charter upon its power of taxation had reference to its ordinary municipal debts and expenses. In reference to the act of 1881, it is only necessary to say that, if it refers to indebtedness for railroad subscriptions, the limit imposed by it cannot be made to apply to indebtedness created prior to its passage, accompanied, as the latter was, with power in the city at the time it was created, to impose taxation sufficient to discharge it. The judgment was affirmed. See also * Ackley School District v. Hall: Supreme Court case on defaulted municipal bonds from Iowa * Findlay v.

Early life and education Verna Arvey was born in Los Angeles, the daughter of Bessie (Tark) and David Arvey. Her parents were Russian Jewish immigrants.\\"William Grant Still and Verna Arvey Papers\\", University of Arkansas. She attended local schools and the Manual Arts High School. She had started playing piano as a child. After graduating, Arvey enjoyed a brief career as a concert pianist, including performances as a soloist with Raymond Paige's CBS Network orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. Avery met William Grant Still in 1930, when Still travelled to Los Angeles to revive his friendship with the composer Harold Bruce Forsythe. Forsythe likely asked her to read some of his piano music. Still tried twice to get her to perform his pieces, first Africa, then Four Negro Dances. The two became more acquainted, but as Forsythe and Arvey had been friends for many years (since they had both gone to Manual Arts High School), some jealousy ensued. Marriage and family Arvey married Still in 1939. She was of Russian Jewish heritage and Still was African American, but their interracial union (unusual for a high-profile couple of the era) did not appear to damage their careers. The couple had two children. They were married until Still's death in 1978. Arvey's granddaughter is journalist Celeste Headlee. Musical career Arvey's first collaboration with Still came in 1939 when Langston Hughes, the original librettist for his opera Troubled Island, left the country before the project was completed. Arvey wrote the lyrics for three arias. She became the librettist for his subsequent operatic work, most notably A Bayou Legend, A Southern Interlude, Costaso and Mota. As a writer on music, Arvey published articles for The New York Times and several music industry publications, including Etude, Musical Courier, Opera, Concert and Symphony, Musical America, Chesterian (London), American Dancer, Ritmo (Madrid), Musical Digest and American Mercury. Works She also wrote books, including the following: *1939 monograph, Studies of Contemporary American Composers: William Grant Still *1941, Choreographic Music *1984, biography of her late husband, In One Lifetime (Fayetteville: University of Arkansas Press).

The site is a significant multi-component site, with finds dating from the Late Archaic to the Middle Woodland Period. It notably includes a shell midden that has only been moderately affected by vandalism and development; these are particularly rare in coastal Rhode Island. The site was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description The Greenwich Cove site was discovered in 1976, during the construction of a residential subdivision. Test excavations identified a number of features, including a shell midden and a habitation area on a knoll overlooking Narragansett Bay, with a kettlehole nearby as the only source of fresh water. The site was subjected to an extensive salvage excavation in 1979, when it was threatened by complete destruction from the development. Finds at the site include a small number of stone tools (projectile points and scrapers), and significant number of stone chips, evidence of the manufacture of stone tools.Moran, Geoffrey (September 1979); NRHP nomination for Greenwich Cove Site (redacted version available by request from the National Park Service) Test holes were dug into the shell midden, which was determined by be in size. Finds from this area included tempered pottery fragments, stone toolmaking chips, and a few fragments of bone. A nearby test hole also found evidence of fire-hardened stone, and organic remains. At the lowest level of that hole evidence of a hearth was uncovered, along with bone tools and stone fragments suitable for toolmaking. One human burial, that of a child aged about seven, was also found at the site. In 1980, the site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in the hopes that doing so would draw resources for a more thorough excavation of the site.

The ground is said to be floating when this connection does not exist. Conductors are also described as having a floating voltage if they are not connected electrically to another non-floating (grounded) conductor. Without such a connection, voltages and current flows are induced by electromagnetic fields or charge accumulation within the conductor rather than being due to the usual external potential difference of a power source.  Applications  Electrical equipment may be designed with a floating ground for one of several reasons. One is safety. For example, a low voltage DC power supply, such as a mobile phone charger is connected to the mains through a transformer of one type or another, and there is no direct electrical connection between the current return path on the low-voltage side and physical ground (earth). Ensuring that there is no electrical connection between mains voltage and the low-voltage plug makes it much easier to guarantee safety of the supply. It also allows the charger to safely only connect to live and neutral, which allows a two-prong plug in countries where this is relevant. Indeed, any home appliance with a two-prong plug must have a floating ground. Another application is in electronic test equipment. Suppose you wish to measure a 0.5 V potential difference between two wires that are both approximately 100 V above Earth ground. If your measuring device has to connect to Earth, some of its electronic components will have to deal with a 100 V potential difference across their terminals. If the whole device floats, then its electronics will only see the 0.5 V difference, allowing more delicate components to be used which can make more precise measurements. Such devices are often battery powered. Other applications includes aircraft and spacecraft. An example showing mains-powered electronic instruments with a floating ground. Thirdly, a floating ground can help eliminate ground loops, which reduces the noise coupled to the system. An example of such a configuration is shown in the image on the right. Systems isolated in this manner can and do drift in potential and if the transformer is capable of supplying much power, they can be dangerous. This is particularly likely if the floated system is near high voltage power lines. To reduce the danger of electric shocks, the chassis of the instruments are usually connected separately to Earth ground.  Safety  Floating grounds can be dangerous if they are caused by failure to properly ground equipment that was designed to require grounding, because the chassis can be at a very different potential from that of any nearby organisms, who then get an electric shock upon touching it. Live chassis TVs, where the set's ground is derived by rectifying live mains, were common until the 1990s. Exposed live grounds are dangerous. They are live, and can electrocute end users if touched. Headphone sockets fitted by end users to live chassis TVs are especially dangerous, as not only are they often live, but any electrical shock will pass through the user‚Äôs head. Sets that have both a headphone socket and a live chassis use an audio isolation transformer to make the arrangement safe. Floating grounds can cause problems with audio equipment using RCA connectors (also called phono connectors). With these common connectors, the signal pin connects before the ground, and 2 pieces of equipment can have a greater difference between their grounds than it takes to saturate the audio input. As a result, plugging or unplugging while powered up can result in very loud noises in speakers. If the ground voltage difference is small, it tends to only cause hum and clicks. A residual current device can be incorporated into a system to reduce but not eliminate the risks caused by a floating ground.

Also, noble metal alloy ODS materials, for example, platinum-based alloys, are used in glass production. When it comes to re-entry at hypersonic speeds, the properties of gases change dramatically. Shock waves that can cause serious damage on any structure are created. Also at these speeds and temperatures, oxygen becomes very aggressive.  Mechanism  Oxide dispersion strengthening is based on incoherency of the oxide particles within the lattice of the material. The oxide particles decrease movement of dislocations within the material and in turn prevent creep. Since the oxide particles are incoherent, dislocations can only overcome the particles by climb. Whereas, if the particles were semi- coherent or coherent with the lattice, the dislocations can simply shear the particles. Climb is less energetically favourable (occurs at high temperatures) than simply shearing and therefore stops dislocation movement more effectively. Climb can occur either at the particle-dislocation interface (local climb) or by overcoming multiple particles at once (general climb). General climb requires less energy and therefore is the common climb mechanism. The presence of incoherent particles introduces a threshold stress (œÉt), since an additional stress will have to be applied for the dislocations to move past the oxides by climb. Moreover, dislocation even after overcoming particle by climb can still remain pinned at the particle-matrix interface with an attractive phenomenon called interfacial pinning which further requires additional threshold stress to detach a dislocation out of this pinning, which must be overcome for the plastic deformation to occur. The following equations represent the strain rate and stress as a result of the introduction of oxides in the material. Strain Rate: \\\\overset{.}{\\\\epsilon}=A'(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma-\\\\sigma_t}{\\\\mu})^n Threshold Shear Stress: \\\\tau_{th}=\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2}\\\\frac{Gb}{l}  Synthesis  The creep properties of ODS steels are highly dependent on the characteristics of the nano-oxides particles which exist in the metal matrix, specifically the ability of these particles to prevent dislocation motion as well as the size and distribution of the particles. Hoelzer and coworkers have shown that an alloy containing a homogeneous dispersion of 1-5 nm Y2Ti2O7 nanoclusters has superior creep properties to an alloy with a heterogeneous dispersion of 5-20 nm nanoclusters of the same composition.Hoelzer DT, Bentley J, Sokolov MA, Miller MK, Odette GR, Alinger MJ. J Nucl Mater 2007;367:166. In the pursuit of new ODS steels it is important to focus on processes that allow for the formation of a dense homogeneous dispersion of small nanoclusters. Simplified scheme of conventional process of ODS steel (a) and the modified process promoting nano-oxide formation ODS steels are commonly produced through ball- milling an oxide of interest (e.g. Y2O3, Al2O3) with pre-alloyed metal powders followed by compression and sintering of the material. It is believed that the nano-oxides enter into solid solution with the metal during ball-milling and subsequently precipitate during the thermal treatment to yield the ODS steel. This process seems simple but many parameters need to be carefully controlled to produce a well made alloy. Work by Leseigneur and coworkers has been done to carefully control some of these parameters in order to get more consistent and better microstructures in ODS steels.Laurent-Brocq, M., et al. \\"Influence of ball-milling and annealing conditions on nanocluster characteristics in oxide dispersion strengthened steels.\\" Acta Materialia 60.20 (2012): 7150-7159. In this two step method the oxide is ball-milled for longer periods of time to ensure a homogeneous solid solution of the oxide in the metal matrix. Then the powder is annealed at higher temperatures to begin a controlled nucleation of the nano-oxide clusters. Finally the powder is again compressed and sintered to yield the final material.  Advantages and disadvantages Advantages: * Can be machined, brazed, formed, cut with available processes. * Develops a protective oxide layer that is self-healing. * This oxide layer is stable and has a high emission coefficient. * Allows the design of thin-walled structures (sandwich). * Resistant to harsh weather conditions in the troposphere. * Low maintenance cost. * Low material cost. Disadvantages: * It has a higher expansion coefficient than other materials, causing higher thermal stresses. * Higher density. * Lower maximum allowable temperature.

The Aurora Plastics Corporation is a U.S. toy and hobby manufacturing company. It is known primarily for its production of plastic model kits of airplanes, automobiles, and TV and movie figures in the 1960s. Its principal competition in modeling were various other plastic modeling firms like Revell and Monogram. History Aurora Plastics Corporation was founded in March 1950 by engineer Joseph E. Giammarino (1916‚Äì1992) and businessman Abe Shikes (1908‚Äì1986) in Brooklyn, New York (moving to West Hempstead, Long Island in 1954), as a contract manufacturer of injection molded plastics (Giammarino 2007; Graham 2007, pp. 1‚Äì2). With the hiring in 1952 of salesman John Cuomo (1901‚Äì1971), the company began the manufacture of its own line of plastic model kits, efficiently marketed with a skeleton staff (Gosson 2015, pp 68‚Äì69). The target market were young hobbyists, similar to the kits of the rival companies, Monogram and Revell. Aurora profitably targeted a younger demographic than their competitors, creating smaller-sized, less detailed models at a lower price (Bussie 2007; O'Connor 2006). The first kits came in late 1952 and were 1:48 scale aircraft models. One was a F9F Panther jet and the other an F90 Lockheed (Bussie 2007). The Aurora logo at this time appeared in narrow white letters and in a semi- circular form across the top of the script; the more recognized Aurora oval did not appear until 1957 (Bussie 2007). Boxes were a simply illustrated orange color. The slogan under the Aurora logo was \\"U ‚Äì Ma ‚Äì Kit\\" (You Make It) (Bussie 2007). Aurora's market approach was to make kits simple, thus undercutting the competition. Along these lines these first two kits appear to have been Hawk kits measured and copied to Aurora's own molds (Bussie 2007). By 1953, six more dies had been made for new airplanes: the Curtiss P-40E Warhawk, Messerschmitt Me-109, North American F-86D, and the Lockheed P-38L Lightning, and a fictitious Russian \\"Yak-25\\" (later sold as \\"Mig-19\\") (Globalsecutity, no date). Lastly was the Mitsubishi Zero, called the \\"Jap Zero\\" on the box flaps (Bussie 2007). With the first two Hawk copies, this collection was called the \\"Brooklyn Eight\\" (Bussie 2007).  Product range  = Aircraft mainstay = Aurora Plastic's first kits were aircraft and this was a backbone of sales through the 1950s and 1960s. From early on the company's Famous Fighters line was popular. Included were World War I, World War II, jet age aircraft and a variety of whirlybirds. A series of aircraft from the 1930s were also offered. Sailing ships, warships, tanks and other military vehicles were available as well (DeHavilland 1957). One World War I airplane was the DeHavilland Airco DH.4. Many planes, like the Blue Angel F-4J, McDonnell-Douglas Phantom II and the LTV A-7D Corsair II, were offered in a larger 1/48 scale. Others were smaller scale such as the Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker in about 1:100, because it would have been over two feet long in 1/48; and even smaller, like the Convair B-58 Hustler bomber in a diminutive 1:200 scale, or about 6 inches long. =Automotive kits= By 1965, Aurora had many automobile kits in 1:32 \\"slot car\\" scale including the Triumph TR3, MG- TD, Jaguar XK120, Austin-Healey 3000, Alfa Romeo GT convertible, Mercedes-Benz 300 SL convertible, 1958 Ford \\"Squarebird\\" Thunderbird, the American Cunningham, and a few Indianapolis 500 winners, like the Monroe Special, and the Fuel Injection Special. =Media tie-ins= Aurora probably had their biggest success with their kits of figures. These included a series of popular historical knights in armor, and other still life buildings, animals, boats, and other intriguing objects. Guys and Gals of all Nations were also produced and included Dutch, Chinese, Indian, Scottish and Mexican figures (DeHaviland 1957). Aurora acquired a license from Universal Studios to create a line of kits based on the Universal monsters, which became the company‚Äôs most popular offerings. Aurora's kit of Frankenstein appeared in 1961. Giant Frankenstein was an all-plastic kit that, when assembled, created a 19-inch tall model (Coopee 2015). This was followed by twelve other monster figures that were issued and reissued in various versions through the early 1970s (Castile 1996). After this monster vehicles such as Dracula's Dragster, Frankenstein's Flivver, Godzilla's Go-Cart, King Kong's Thronester, Mummy's Chariot and Wolfman's Wagon were introduced, fortifying the company's car offerings (Gosson 2015, p. 69). Licensed models based on characters from movies, TV shows and comic books were also introduced. Batman was a regular offering as was the Hulk, so both DC and Marvel characters were represented. Model kits from Twelve O'Clock High, The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Mod Squad, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (the larger Seaview sub and a separate kit of its flying sub), The Invaders, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants and Star Trek appeared. These kits were often a television-related scene where heroes battled some kind of large monster, alien or animal. Aurora‚Äôs figure kits continue to be highly valued by collectors. Aurora used artist James Bama for some of their box art. = Model motoring = An Aurora Thunderjet, or T-jet, chassis. In the late 1950s, Aurora acquired the rights to the Model Motoring slot car racing system from U.K. toy manufacturer Playcraft. Aurora's first HO-gauge racing sets appeared in the fall of 1960. The cars were originally driven by a unique, vibrator drive system based on a door \\"buzzer.\\" This motor comprised a wire coil around a vertical iron plunger which very quickly opened and closed a contact which fed power to the coil, and also drove a reed up and down that engaged a toothed drum on the rear axle, causing it to turn. When these early cars ran down the track they produced a loud \\"buzz,\\" which many users found irritating. The vibrator car was produced until 1963 when the Thunderjet pancake motor, or T-jet, replaced it. Following improvements in the chassis with the Thunderjet and A/FX series and the adoption of popular racing car body styles, Aurora's Model Motoring race sets became top sellers, with over 25,000,000 cars sold by 1965 (HO Slot Car Racing 1999‚Äì2011). By the end of the 1970s, however, the slot car craze had passed and modeling in general was on the decline (HO Slot Car Racing 1999‚Äì2011). One website attributes the decline to both the maturing of the baby-boom generation along with the fragile economics of the slot car industry and the closing of many slot car shops as toy companies offered smaller sets to be used at home (Slotblog 2007). = Cigarbox competes with Hot Wheels = In 1968, Aurora introduced its Cigarbox miniature cars and the timing could not have been worse. These were developed to compete with Matchbox in the year that Mattel's Hot Wheels were introduced. The Cigarbox car line was a combination of rather bland plastic slot car bodies with metal chassis (Ragan 2000, p. 38). Models were claimed to be HO scale, but the cars were larger than HO ‚Äì yet a bit smaller than Hot Wheels. Cigarbox cars were packaged in small yellow cigar-like boxes which had fancy red serif lettering and gold trim. The boxes were slightly larger, flatter and more rectangular than those of Matchbox, measuring 4\\" x 2.75\\" x just over 1\\" deep (Breithaupt no date). If Lesney could have \\"Match\\" boxes, Aurora figured it could have \\"Cigar\\" boxes. The popular rumor was that Matchbox took Aurora to court for copyright infringement over the similar marketing approach. Today the idea skirts the boundaries of the culturally acceptable. Was smoking being promoted? In any event, the Cigarbox marque soon disappeared (Ragan 2000, p. 38‚Äì39). Some of the cars offered, however, were unique and not often seen in miniature, such as the 1967 Ford Galaxie 500, 1963 Buick Riviera, Mako Shark Corvette concept, Cheetah Chevy, Lola GT racing coupe, and the Porsche 904 (Ragan 2000, p. 39). Several Formula 1 cars were also offered in the series (Southwest Spirit Antiques 1998‚Äì2011). Initially, most cars were offered in rather plain colored plastic bodies with high friction ('squeaky') wheels, though their rubber tires were more authentic than hard plastic ‚Äì making them somewhat similar to Matchbox tradition. Some of the cars, such as the De Tomaso Mangusta, had working steering. Eventually, thinner, low-friction wheels (some chromed and some not) were added and chrome-like shiny paint finishes were introduced, making the cars flashy, but competition was keen and financial troubles loomed. These improved versions were sold under the Speed Line name, and also as slot car bodies and in kit form, but the line was discontinued by 1970.  Logo use and retooling  Aurora‚Äôs founders retired in the late 1960s and the company was sold to outside investors in 1969. After expanding into the toys and games market with limited success, the new owners sold the company to Nabisco in 1971. Nabisco received unwanted publicity when Aurora introduced a line of ‚ÄúMonster Scenes‚Äù which included torture devices and a scantily-clad female victim; newspapers reported negatively on the line, and the National Organization for Women voiced their objection (Rossen 2016). Seven years after their acquisition, Nabisco sold the company to the Anglo-US toy company Dunbee-Combex-Marx who also owned the Scalextric racing system and Frog (models) kits for $11.5m. Aurora had been loss-making for a number of years but Dunbee-Combex-Marx failed to turn Aurora around and ended up failing itself in 1980. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, toy and hobby company Playing Mantis created a division called Polar Lights (as a reference to Aurora) which reissued some of Aurora‚Äôs most popular kits. Other companies following in Aurora's shoes have reissued earlier kits (Gosson 2015, p. 72). These companies include Moebius, Atlantis and Monarch, which mostly have focused on the Aurora sci-fi and horror TV and movie figures and scenes. For example, Moebius, started by a former distributor of Polar Lights models in Glenwood, Florida, has reissued the large kit of the submarine Seaview from the 1960s Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea TV show and the old Dr. Jekyll as Mr. Hyde kit (Moebius Models website). Monarch models is based in London, Ontario, Canada ‚Äì started by a doctor (Powell 2009; Monarch Models website 2011). Atlantis Models is based in Deer Park, New York, and though also making sci-fi figures, has equal focus on animal dioramas. In 2018 Atlantis Purchased most of the Aurora Tooling that remained at Revell Monogram in Elk Grove. (Atlantis Models website; Powell 2010). Polar Lights, Monarch and Moebius all use an oval logo very similar in shape to that of the original Aurora style. The Atlantis (see Zorro re-issue) logo uses a more abstract, though nostalgic, oval broken into six sections. In the 1990s, the family of Joseph Giammarino announced the return of Aurora Plastics Corporation as a manufacturer of hobby kits under the name LAPCO, or Lost Aurora Plastics Corporation, with a product line to include reverse engineered reissues of long-gone kits. Nothing came of this. Again in 2007, Giammarino's family announced the return of Aurora, with their first offerings stated to include aircraft and figure kits from their original 1960s line (Giammarino 2007). This web site lists products to be made available in May‚ÄìJune 2012, but as of November 2018, none are available to order and the site appears to have not been updated.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of two side platforms along a double tracked line and a disused station building. Haugenstua is served by the L1 line of the Norwegian State Railways's Oslo Commuter Rail. The station was opened on 1 December 1937 and received a major renovation in 2007. It has about 3,200 daily passengers. History The Trunk Line past Haugenstua opened on 1 September 1854 and residents were served by Grorud Station, some to the southwest. The somewhat closer H√∏ybr√•ten Station opened on 20 October 1921.Bjerke & Holom: 54 During the construction of a line the railway company built a navvy house at H√∏ybr√•ten. With the opening of the line, this was moved and converted to a house for the gatekeeper for the level crossing at Haugenstua. When the line was doubled in 1903, the road was placed in an underpass and the gatekeeper's house fell out of use.Torbo: 102 The line past Haugenstua received double track in 1903 and was electrified in 1927.

However, it never received any station building, nor did it ever have a passing loop.Torbo: 100 Originally the station was served by eighteen northbound and fifteen southbound trains per day.Torbo: 26 Patronage grew rapidly from the 1970s, as a large-scale residential development project commenced in 1967.Torbo: 125 Ticket sales were introduced in 1991, but terminated shortly afterwards. Locals demanded during the 1990s that the station be upgraded. They main concern was that the northern platform was wooden and in poor shape, and a safety hazard as it would be slippery when wet. Grants for the upgrade were initially issued in 2001, but in the last minute reallocated to Sk√∏yen Station. In 2005 money was again put aside, but with only one tender the Norwegian National Rail Administration had to postpone the work. Construction commenced on 22 September 2006. The upgrade also included a new underpass under the tracks at the station, which acts as part of a continuous recreational path from Lillomarka to the Oslofjord. The project cost 32 million Norwegian krone and was opened on 21 August 2007. Real time traffic information systems for the public were installed in 2010. Facilities Haugenstua Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, during the last segment of the Trunk Line where it is still climbing up Groruddalen.Torbo: 96 The line past Haugenstua is double track and electrified. There are no passing loops at Haugenstua. The station features two side platforms with sheds. Both are long; track 1 is tall while track 2 is tall. There are 24 parking spaces at the station, a bicycle shed and tickets and snacks vending machine. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves Haugenstua with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Lillestr√∏m Station along the Trunk Line past Haugenstua to Oslo Central Station and then along the Drammen Line to Asker Station before serving the Spikkestad Line and terminating at Spikkestad Station. Haugenstua has two trains per direction per hour with additional trains during rush hour, which is scheduled to increase to four in late 2014.

Kent County was set off from Providence County in 1750. The same year, a courthouse was constructed in East Greenwich, then the largest town in the new county. By 1799 the courthouse was too small, and the state legislature appointed a committee for the construction of a new building. The old building was sold and dismantled, and a new courthouse built on the site in 1804‚Äì05. It was designed and built by contractor Oliver Wickes. Rhode Island had an unusual \\"rotating legislature\\" from 1759 to 1901. In order to keep state government local, the legislature occupied each county seat on a rotating schedule. In 1854, only the buildings in Providence and Newport were used. In 1901, when the new Rhode Island State House was first occupied, Providence became the state capitol, and the buildings in Bristol, South Kingstown, and East Greenwich were turned over to the counties. By the early twentieth century, the courthouse was in need of modernization. In 1908 the Providence architectural firm of William R. Walker & Son was hired to renovate the structure. However, as soon as work had begun, it was revealed that the building's structural integrity had been compromised over the years.

The building in East Greenwich was repurposed as the East Greenwich Town Hall, replacing the old shingle-style town hall, formerly a block north on Main Street.

History Nutbourne Windmill was built in 1854. It had a short working life, stopping c.1894. The mill gradually became derelict, although the cap was still on the mill during the Second World War. At some point, the tail beam failed, and the windshaft was left hanging down vertically at the top of the tower, supported by the stocks alone. The mill tower now serves as a tasting room and shop for Nutbourne vineyards. Description Nutbourne Windmill is a five-storey brick and stone tower mill with a stage at first floor level. The mill had a beehive cap, winded by a fantail and is thought to have had four Spring sails. The mill drove two pairs of underdrift millstones.

The site consisted of a large shell midden and a dispersed collection of associated stone artifacts at an inland location, which were dated to the Late Woodland Period. The site was examined by professional archaeologists in 1980, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its potential to reveal information about prehistoric land use patterns. It was destroyed in 1991 by residential development of the area, although significant quantities of archaeological material were recovered prior to its destruction. Description The Lambert Farm Site was located in Warwick, Rhode Island, in the coastal plains above Narragansett Bay. Its principal feature was a shell midden, which had only been slightly damaged by agricultural activity in the area at the time of its discovery. The midden includes remains of shellfish, bone, and ceramics, and is surrounded by a collection of stone artifacts. The area has been known to be of prehistoric significance since at least 1897, but was only first surveyed by professional archaeologists in 1980. This survey determined the extent of the most intensive prehistoric activity at the site, and provided dating of the site to the Late Woodland Period.Morenon, E. Pierre (1981). National Register nomination for Lambert Farm Site; available (in redacted form) by request from the National Park Service The site was one of a small number of inland middens known in the state. It was deemed significant because it was relatively unaltered, despite surface-level plow damage. It was believed, at the time of its listing on the National Register, that evidence of habitation (post holes and hearths) might be found below the plow zone, or under the midden itself, were it to be more fully excavated. Further investigation of the site was expected to yield additional information about subsistence, habitation, and migration patterns in the region. The area where the site was located was slated for development in 1991, and the developer agreed to delay construction work on a area surrounding the site, in which salvage archaeology could be performed. This work recovered more than of shells, considered somewhat unusual because the site was more than from the bay. Also found at the site were the prehistoric burial sites of one adult dog and two puppies, dated to c. 800 BCE. The site's bounds were also found to be larger than previously thought, with the finds indicating evidence of year- round habitation.

The Lippitt Manufacturing Company was founded by Revolutionary War officer, Col. Christopher Lippitt, his brother Charles Lippitt, and Benjamin Aborn, George Jackson, Amasa Mason, and William Mason. During the Depression following of War of 1812 the Lippitt Manufacturing Company survived by supplying yarn to convict weavers in the Vermont prison. The company grew throughout the 19th century becoming a large profitable enterprise in which several generations of the Lippitt family were involved. In 1889 all of the Lippitt Company assets were sold to the firm of B.B. Knight & Robert Knight, founders of Fruit of the Loom. In 1925, B.B. Knight sold the Lippitt Mill property to Joseph Hayes, owner of the Riverpoint Lace Works. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The Hayes family stopped manufacturing lace here in the early 1970s, but they retained ownership of the property until it went into receivership in 2008. The mill continued operation until 2010, when spring flooding on the Pawtuxet River and a bad economy forced the mill to close. A plan was announced in 2014 to convert the property to residences for people over 55.

The club was one of the earliest teams that competed in the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, joining the league in its second season in 2007‚Äì08, and never failing to qualify for the championship playoffs in their four years of competition, reaching the Grand Final in the 2008‚Äì09 season. They also finished second in the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship on two occasions, as well as winning the regional Port Moresby Premier League twice, in 1989 and 2004. The club most recently took part in the 2017 Papua New Guinea National Premier League, having broken away from the Papua New Guinea Football Association in late 2016. They finished bottom of the Southern Conference.  History  = Foundation and early years = The club was founded in 1982, and the earliest record of their competitive activity comes from 1984, when they took part in the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship. They were drawn into Group Three and topped the group with a 100% record, but they needed two penalty shoot-outs to progress to the final, beating Guria Lahi 4‚Äì3 and Lae University 4‚Äì2 after both matches ended as 0‚Äì0 draws. In the final, they fell to Buresong 1‚Äì0. In the 1988 competition, they finished third after losing to Guria Lahi in the semi-finals, before entering the regional Port Moresby Premier League for the first time in 1989, winning the competition. = Second regional title and several near misses = Historical records pick up again at the turn of the century, with the side taking part in the 1998 Port Moresby Premier League. The side finished top of the league with 67 points, seven clear of second- placed ICF University and well clear of the sides further back. A 3‚Äì1 victory over Defence was enough to see them into the final, but they were beaten by University 2‚Äì1 and denied a second title. In June 1999, the side reached the final of the National Club Championship, losing 2‚Äì1 to Guria Lahi. Later that year, they made it to the knockout stages of the Port Moresby Premier League, defeating champions University but losing to PS United and Defence and eventually placing 3rd. The following year, the side progressed to the quarter-finals of the 2000 National Club Championship, before being beaten by eventual champions Unitech. The side were once again denied the Port Moresby Premier League by PS United, losing to the side 1‚Äì0 thanks to a Clement Anison own goal. The 2001 Port Moresby Premier League was a disappointing one by Rapatona's standards, with the side finishing 5th in the league table and losing their only knockout game 3‚Äì0 against Defence in September. On 11 November 2001, the side were due to face Hatolol in the National Club Championship third-place match, but the results of the match are unknown. The side's poor placing in the Port Moresby Premier League meant they failed to qualify for the 2002 National Club Championship, and they haven't returned to the competition to date. However, the side finished third in the 2002 Port Moresby Premier League regular season table before progressing to the knockout finals, where they were again denied a title by ICF University. In the final four seasons before the side joined the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, the side continued their tradition of reaching the Port Moresby Premier League Grand Final every second year, having been runners-up in 1998, 2000 and 2002. The 2003 season was a flop, with the side finishing 6th in the league table and failing to qualify for the knockout stage entirely. However, in 2004 they picked up their first title in fifteen years, despite only finishing third in the league, eventually defeating league winners PS Rutz 1‚Äì0 in the Grand Final. In 2005 they reached the knockout stages again, losing to Souths United, while the 2006 season saw them reach a Grand Final for the final time, losing 4‚Äì2 on penalties to ICF University once again, after the score after extra-time remained 0‚Äì0. = National Soccer League = Shortly before the 2007‚Äì08 National Soccer League season, Rapatona once more competed in the Port Moresby Premier Division, finishing 4th in both the regular season table and the knockout stages. Under the sponsorship of Inspac, they entered the second edition of the NSL and played their first semi-professional match against fellow newcomers to the league, Besta Madang Fighters, winning 3‚Äì0. They would eventually go on to finish 4th in the league table, qualifying for the knockout stages, before going down 3‚Äì0 to Gelle Hills in the semi-final and losing 3‚Äì1 to Morobe Kumuls in the third-place playoff. Ahead of the 2008‚Äì09 season, Rapatona secured sponsorship from South Korean building contractor CMSS, who had signed an agreement with the Papua New Guinean government to construct the Port Moresby Casino Hotel. The side was renamed CMSS Rapatona Tigers, but maintained their original name for the 2008 Port Moresby Premier League campaign, where they finished second in the regular season table. However, on 5 October 2008, the team were once again beaten in the knockout stages by ICF University. In the NSL, the team enjoyed another successful campaign, again finishing 4th in the league table before gaining revenge on ICF University, now under the name of University Inter, by defeating them 2‚Äì1 in the knockout semi-finals, thanks to goals from Richard Auram and Raymond Gunemba. The side were set to face Hekari United in the Grand Final, but following two postponements on 21 March and 28 March, the PNGFA awarded the championship to Hekari United, with approval from Rapatona, by virtue of their higher league position. In the spring and summer of 2009, the side once again took part in the Port Moresby Premier League, but the season was cut short by the PNGFA after the Port Moresby Soccer Association was suspended. Rapatona led the league table at the time. Nevertheless, the side entered their third consecutive National Soccer League for the 2009‚Äì10 season, and qualified for the knockout stages for the third year in a row. However, a handball by Ila Ilaitia Jr allowed Gigira Laitepo Morobe to win against Rapatona in their semi-final 1‚Äì0, after substitute Kohu Liam converted the resulting penalty. This failure to reach the Grand Final prompted franchise owner Jimmy Kim to 'ponder' on the club's future in the NSL. The side did, however, secure third place with a 3‚Äì1 victory over University Inter. = Withdrawal from NSL = In July 2009, it was reported that the side had changed their name to Moresby Casino Hotel Tigers FC and had confirmed their participation in the upcoming 2010‚Äì11 season. However, a week later it was reported that the side were yet to submit the required forms to confirm their participation. Indeed, in early August, it was confirmed that owner Jimmy Kim had withdrawn the side from the upcoming season, citing his need to focus on the construction of the Port Moresby Casino Hotel and his disappointment that the side failed to reach the previous season's Grand Final. In June 2012, it was reported that the club was now defunct, with several of their former players having since moved to Spartans. In May 2013, the side returned to football at the regional level, entering the Port Moresby Premier League for the first time in four years. In their first game back in the competition, they fought out a 1‚Äì1 draw with fellow former champions MacLaren FC. In mid-July, the side were top of the league, but in early August the side lost 4‚Äì3 to Defence, despite a hat-trick from Alwin Komolong, and their form began to stutter. However, the side qualified for the knockout stages by finishing in the top five, before losing to MacLaren in their only knockout match, placing them 5th overall. The side entered the 2014 competition too, going into the final two fixtures leading the league table on goal difference ahead of MacLaren. In the final gameweek, the side lost 2‚Äì1 to MacLaren, and it is assumed that they finished the season in second place. = Return to NSL; Defection to National Premier League = Ahead of the 2015‚Äì16 National Soccer League season, it was revealed that the side, under new sponsorship from Posman Kua Aisi Lawyers (PKA), would be taking part in their first NSL for five seasons. The side were drawn into the Southern Zone, where they finished second behind Hekari United, thus qualifying for the Championship Playoff, which for the first time consisted of a Group stage with the top two teams from the Northern and Southern Zones. However, the side won just one match during the stage, finishing bottom of the table and 4th overall that season. On 30 December 2016, Rapatona, alongside 11 other associations across the country, confirmed they would be splitting from the National Soccer League. In February 2017, the new Papua New Guinea National Premier League was launched, with Rapatona's participation being confirmed shortly afterwards. However, the side's season was far from successful, with the side finishing bottom of the Southern Conference and failing to be invited back for the following season's competition.

The main mill is an irregularly shaped complex of structures, which grew from the original Pearce Brothers Woolen Mill, a two-story rubble-stone structure that predates 1859, and has been extended in all directions. Most of the additions were made in the first two decades of the 20th century. The dam, about long, is an earth-fill structure faced in fieldstone and capped in 20th- century concrete, with a modern spillway.

Situated from Oslo Central Station, it consists of two side platforms along a double tracked line and a disused station building. H√∏ybr√•ten is served by the L1 line of the Norwegian State Railways's Oslo Commuter Rail. Its station is the second in Oslo's Tram network, the first being R√∏dby station, which was built in the late 1800s. Trunk lines were once the main railway network in Scandinavia, providing transportation throughout Scandinavia. In 1863 Trunk Line Norway was founded, in place of the non- existent Board of Railways, which was found wanting in providing rural- and mountainous-only railways. The station opened as H√∏ibr√•ten on 20 October 1921, following the establishment of a residential area the previous decade and a half. It received a wooden station building designed by Gudmund Hoel. From 1927 it also had electric traction and all local trains started to stop at the station. It took its current name the following year. H√∏ybr√•ten remained staffed until 1967. History The Trunk Line past H√∏ybr√•ten opened on 1 September 1854 and residents were served by Grorud Station, some to the southwest. L√∏renskog Station, then named Robsrud, opened on 20 April 1891, the northeast.Bjerke & Holom: 54 In 1899 there were still only about one hundred people living in the area, most of which lived on one of the four H√∏ybr√•ten farms.Torbo: 96 The segment of track was doubled in 1903.Bjerke & Holom: 52 From 1905 Anton Tschudi started selling lots from his farm √òvre H√∏ybr√•ten, which were affordable for ordinary workers. However, to settle so far from the city center it was necessary to get a better transport service. Trains were available from L√∏renskog, but the first service did not arrive at Oslo East Station until 07:40, too late for industry workers. They were therefore often forced to spend the weeks in the city center and the weekends with their families at H√∏ybr√•ten. The matter was corrected from 21 April 1908, when a new red eye services commenced.Torbo: 97 The settlers' association at H√∏ibr√•ten took initiative in 1906 for H√∏ybr√•ten to receive its own station.: 202 In particular, Tschudi was willing to grant free land to the railway in exchange for a station. NSB rejected the offer, stating that the site was too steep for the steam locomotives to stop and that the neighborhood was within walking distance of Grorud and L√∏renskog. The settlers' association repeated the request several times without further advancement in the issue, the latest in 1914. They then took contact with MP Magnus Nilssen, who organized an inspection with NSB's executives. This proved successful and on 13 February 1917 the Norwegian Trunk Railway made an offer to the residents and the municipality, Aker.Torbo: 98 A station would be built on the conditions that half the estimated cost of 50,000 Norwegian krone (NOK) be covered by the settlers and the municipality, that an adequate road be built to the site and that free land be provided. The station would only serve passengers, not cargo, and the railway company was free to determine the number of trains. The issue was approved by Aker Municipal Council on 7 March 1918 along with a grant of NOK 25,000.: 203 As the chosen site was altered in relation to the original demands, Ralf Tschudi instead issued a grant of NOK 5,000 instead of free land. Planning, financing and expropriation were concluded in 1920, allowing construction to start. During construction there arose a disagreement between the railway company and the municipality as to the standards of the roads to the station, which ended with the municipality having to conduct further work. This cost them a further NOK 23,100. The station opened as H√∏ibr√•ten on 20 October 1921, but received only a limited number of services, still hauled by steam train. The railway operations were taken over by the Norwegian State Railways on 4 March 1926. The line received electric traction on 1 September 1927, after which all local trains along the line stopped at the station.Torbo: 100 H√∏ybr√•ten received a post office on 1 July 1928 and this was situated in the station building.Torbo: 101 The station took its current name on 1 December 1928. Contrary to the demands set by the railway company, it allowed cargo handling at the station. Six station masters served at H√∏ybr√•ten until 1961. It remained staffed for sale of tickets and cargo handling until 28 May 1967. The line past the station received centralized traffic control on 24 January 1972. From 1981, with the opening of the Oslo Tunnel, the trains serving H√∏ybr√•ten continued past Oslo Central Station onto the Drammen Line. There were plans for a major redevelopment of the station area in the late 1980s, which involved construction of high-rise condominiums with 300 apartments, underground parking and a shopping- and sports center, partially over and partially under the tracks. The project was supported by the municipality and NSB, but was never carried out. The residents' association started renting the station building in 1994. They fixed it up and use it for a range of activities including meetings, a hobby room, parties and office space for the local sports club. Real time traffic information systems for the public were installed in 2010. Facilities H√∏ybr√•ten Station is situated from Oslo Central Station, at an elevation of above mean sea level. This is roughly the site where the Trunk Line stops climbing up steep Groruddalen and reaches the flat landscape of Romerike. The line past H√∏ybr√•ten is double track and electrified. There are no passing loops at H√∏ybr√•ten. The station features two side platforms with sheds. Both are long and tall. There are 24 parking spaces at the station, a bicycle shed and a ticket vending machine. The station building was designed by Gudmund Hoel.Bjerke & Holom: 55 The building has four floors, including a foundation story which only faces the platform and an attic. The main stories are built in wooden vertical siding. It features a saddle roof. In its original configuration it consisted of a lower level with public facilities and an upper level with a residence. Service The Norwegian State Railways serves H√∏ybr√•ten with line L1 of the Oslo Commuter Rail. L1 calls at all stations, running from Lillestr√∏m Station along the Trunk Line past H√∏ybr√•ten to Oslo Central Station and then along the Drammen Line to Asker Station before serving the Spikkestad Line and terminating at Spikkestad Station. On weekdays there four trains per hour going east to Lillestr√∏m. Westwards, two trains per hour run to Spikkestad while two more run only to Asker. During weekends the service is half-hourly with all trains running Spikkestad-Lillestr√∏m. Travel time is 16 minutes to Oslo Central Station and 13 minutes to Lillestr√∏m.

After completing high school in 1927, he went to Reims, France, where he studied at √âcole de M√©decine de Reims for 2 years and then enrolled at the Paris University Medical School. An honor student at the medical school, he passed the difficult examinations for an externship and later those for the coveted and highly competitive interne des h√¥pitaux de Paris. He received an M.D. degree in 1937 and, after one year of training in pediatrics with Professor Ribadeau-Dumas at Salp√™tri√®re Hospital in Paris, he returned home. On his return to Iran, Gharib was appointed the first professor of pediatrics at Tehran University by Dr. Charles Oberling, a French educator who was dean of the medical school. Subsequently, Gharib became chairman of the pediatrics department, a post he held until his death in 1975. In 1941, he was the author of the first Persian textbook on diseases of children. Throughout his career, he edited or co edited numerous volumes on pediatric problems and progress in Iran, and published many articles in Persian, French, and American medical journals. He also maintained a thriving pediatrics practice that usually focused on problem cases. During a span of 37 years, Gharib taught the medicine of childhood to thousands of undergraduate and graduate students. Many of his pupils subsequently held important positions in Iranian medical education, including the chairmanship of most of the pediatrics departments in the numerous medical schools in Iran. Because of his endeavors and influence, the field was recognized as a specialty in 1950 and a Pediatrics Specialty Board was created in 1955. In 1960, he and his colleagues founded the Iranian Pediatrics Society, of which he was president until 1974. He was a member of the Advisory Board of the International Pediatrics Association from 1968 to 1974. In 1970, he was instrumental in the planning and building of the 150-bed Children's Hospital Medical Center in Tehran, and he served as its medical director from 1971 to 1975. Gharib was respected as an effective, colorful, and extremely popular teacher by his students; recognized as a superb clinician by his colleagues; and regarded as a dedicated physician by his patients. He was an influential figure in modern Iranian medicine and regarded by the medical community as the \\"Father of Iranian Pediatrics\\". In recognition of his impressive achievements, the French government conferred on him the Cross of the Chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur (Legion of Honour) in 1954. The American magazine M.D., in a series of articles on prominent physicians worldwide, featured Gharib of Iran in its May 1965 issue. Every year, his colleagues and the Iranian Pediatric Society commemorate him by a weeklong seminar entitled \\"Doctor Gharib Memorial Pediatric Conference\\" as a postgraduate course in pediatrics. In 1972, Gharib underwent surgical treatment and radiotherapy for bladder carcinoma. He died of recurrent cancer in Tehran on Jan. 20, 1975. Gharib and his wife Zahra had four children: Nahid, Maryam, Hossein, and Mohsen, and ten grandchildren: Niloofar, Parinaz, Fatemeh, Ameneh, Soheyla, Mohammad, Yasaman, Mahmood, Kimya, and Ali. Zahra Gharib died in 2009 and buried in Virginia.

It is found in areas with mud or sand, and may occur as deep as , though it prefers shallower depths. It is considered endangered due to overfishing.  Description  The undulate ray features a disc-shaped body, triangular in the front and near-circular in the rear, and dermal denticles developed as spines for protection. Median spines are scattered in adults, regular on young. The males have one lateral row each side, whereas the females have three. The eyes are medium-sized and followed by spiracles. The mouth is on the ventral surface and is slightly arched, followed by the five pairs of small gill slits. Tail is as long as body, and has two well separated dorsal fins near its end, usually with two spines between them. The colouring of the dorsal surface varies from light brown to citrine or grey, with darker waved bands and numerous small white patches. Snout and margins are frequently clearer with dark spots. The underside is creamy-white with a greyish margin. It typically weighs about , but can reach to as much as and in length. Distribution and habitat This species has a patchy and discontinuous distribution in northeastern Atlantic. It is found from southern Ireland and England to Senegal, and in the western Mediterranean. It is uncommon overall but can be locally abundant, mainly around the north-west of Ireland, in the eastern side of the English Channel, and near the south coast of Portugal. Like other rays, is usually found on sandy, muddy or detrital bottoms, at depths of 50‚Äì200 m from coastal regions to the upper continental slope, even if it's sometimes possible to find it in shallower water.  Biology  Young Raja undulata at the Aquarium of Genoa There are few data about biology of this species. Using vertebrae as growth markers, maximum lifespan was supposed to be 21‚Äì23 years. It's an oviparous cartilaginous fish. The females lay their eggs from March to September. Each egg is a leathery black eggcase with horny corners, known by the common name \\"mermaid's purse\\" (as are the eggcases of other rays, skates and sharks). They usually are 72‚Äì 90 mm long and 42‚Äì 52 mm wide. These \\"purses\\" often wash up on beaches after rough weather, although usually they wash up empty, the young ray having already hatched out.  Diet  The ray eats small fish, crustaceans, molluscs and other macrobenthos.  Human interactions  Like other benthonic species of similar size this ray is caught incidentally or intentionally by commercial fisheries using trawls, gillnets, and line gears. It is a common host in public aquariums as fares relatively well.  Protection  Because of its late sexual maturity and low rate of population growth, undulate ray is extremely vulnerable to exploitation by fisheries. In the north Atlantic, populations have declined severely from the Irish area, and there are no longer records of catches of this species in the English Channel. Since 2009 it has been illegal to keep Undulate Rays fished in EU waters due to concerns over the decreasing size of stocks. They must be returned unharmed if possible. Reproduction During a study it was found that the gonadosomatic index for the females was higher in the winter, which means that this specie reproduces during this season. Females also matured at significantly larger sized and older ages than males.

Velites were light infantry and skirmishers who were armed with a number of darts (), each with a 30-inch wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a 10-inch (25 cm) narrow metal point, to fling at the enemy. They also carried short thrusting swords, or gladii, for use in melee. They rarely wore armour as they were the youngest and poorest soldiers in the legion and could not afford much equipment. They did carry small wooden shields called parma for protection, and wore headdresses made from wolf skins so their brave deeds could be recognized. The velites were placed at the front partly for tactical reasons, and also so that they had the opportunity to secure glory for themselves in single combat. Velites did not form their own units; a number of them were attached to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They were typically used as a screening force, driving off enemy skirmishers and disrupting enemy formations with javelin throws before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier-armed hastati to attack. They were normally the ones who engaged war elephants and chariots if they were present on the field, such as in the Battle of Zama, in 202 BC. Their high mobility and ranged weaponry made them much more effective against these enemies than heavy infantry. An early Roman legion contained approximately 1,000 velites. Velites were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms. Lucilius suggests that rorarii and velites were interchangeable, with velites gradually superseding rorarii. Another theory is that the leves' equipment was upgraded until they were at the same level as the rorarii, and they both collectively became known as the velites. Equipment A veles in combat A stylized parma Velites were the youngest and usually the poorest (being fifth class citizens, with property worth 400-2,500 denarii) soldiers in the legion, and could rarely afford much equipment. They were armed with veretum, light javelins, each with a 90 cm (3 ft) wooden shaft the diameter of a finger, with a 10-inch (25 cm) narrow metal point, and tips designed to bend on impact to prevent them being thrown back, similar to the heavier pila of other legionaries. Livy says that they each carried seven javelins, however Roman satirist Lucilius says that they carried five, suggesting that the amount may have changed. The hastati and principes carried gladii, relatively short thrusting swords 74 centimetres (29 inches) in length, as their main weapons, and the velites carried them as backup weapons. They fought in a very loose, staggered formation like most irregular troops, and carried small round shields called parma, 90 cm (3 feet) in diameter. The velites were placed at the front of the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to prove themselves and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also why they wore highly identifiable wolfskin headdresses. Organization Dispositions after deployment but prior to engagement Dispositions after velities engagement and withdrawal In the legion, the velites were attached to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They usually formed up at the front of the legion before battle to harass the enemy with javelin throws and to prevent the enemy doing the same before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier infantry to attack. After they had fallen back, they would move up behind the attacking troops and throw darts at the enemy. They also sometimes carried wounded back to the rear, however usually a corps of deportates did this. In a pitched battle, the velites would form up at the front of the legion and cover the advance of the hastati, who were armed with swords. If the hastati failed to break the enemy, they would fall back and let the principes, similarly equipped though more experienced infantry, take over. If the principes failed, they would retire behind the triarii, well trained, heavily armoured, spear armed legionaries and let them attack. The number of triarii was fixed at 600 per legion, there were usually 1,200 hastati and 1,200 principes per legion, with the rest being light infantry like the velites. In the standard legion around the time of the Second Punic War (218 -201 BC) there were 10 maniples of hastati, each having 120 hastati, with 40 velites attached. The maniples were further split into centuries, of 60 hastati and 20 velites, with the centurion of the hastati century commanding the velites as well. After the Romans were ambushed at the Battle of Lake Trasimene, which remains the largest ambush in military history by men involved, in 217 BC, Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus introduced a military step known as the agmen. It was a variable formation, with one or more columns, separated by cohorts, with their allies in between the cohorts. The front of the columns were the extraordinarii, along with some of the velites. Following this formation was a rear-guard of the ablecti, and the rest of the velites. The baggage trail was guarded by the cavalry. Both the front and the flanks contained a number of speculatores (scouts), to provide warning of an enemy army's approach. When enemies were nearby, the baggage train would be dispersed between the maniples. If the columns were forced to retreat, the velites and the extraordinarii that were in the front guarded the retreat of the others; this contrasts with their usual method of retreat, in which the cavalry, the velites, and the triarii stayed behind and covered the retreat. When the Romans set up a temporary castra, two maniples (without their velites) were selected to pitch the tents of the headquarters and officers, and details were made for fatigue duty, to get wood and water, and to give food and water to the animals accompanying them. The rest of the men, excepting velites and officers, set up the tents of the soldiers. During this time the velites would guard the outside of the wall and the wall itself, while the rest of the troops would guard the interior. The watch, which was composed of eight men led by a decurion, ran from 6:00 am to 6:00 pm, and was divided into four shifts, each of three hours. History Velites were descended from an earlier class of light infantry, leves, dating from the Camillan legion of the 5th century BC, who had a very similar role to the velites. They were also the poorer and younger soldiers in the legion, though the rorarii and accensi classes were considerably poorer and were eventually disbanded, having insufficient equipment to be effective soldiers. Leves were likewise armed with a number of javelins, but carried a spear rather than a sword. Like the velites, leves did not have their own units, but were attached to units of hastati. Lucilius, however, suggests that rorarii and velites were interchangeable, with velites gradually superseding rorarii. Another theory is that the leves' equipment was upgraded until they were at the same level as the rorarii, and they both collectively became known as the velites. Velites were first used, and created, at the siege of Capua in 211 BC, and were made up of citizens who would normally be too poor to join the hastati but were called up due a shortage of manpower. They were trained to ride on horseback with the equites and jump down at a given signal to fling javelins at the enemy. After the siege, they were adopted into the legions as a force of irregular light infantry for ambushing and harassing the enemy with javelins before the battle began in earnest. The velites were used against the Carthaginian elephants in the Battle of Zama. After their usual javelin throw, the velites took cover behind the maniples, and then launched a sortie, quickly coming out from behind the troops and attacking the elephants, before retreating again. With the military reforms of Gaius Marius in 107 BC, designed to combat a shortage of manpower due to wars against Jugurtha, the different classes of units were disbanded entirely. The wealth and age requirements were scrapped. Now soldiers would join as a career, rather than as service to the city, and would all be equipped as heavy infantry with the same, state purchased equipment.Life of Marius The Imperial Guard of Napoleon were named after the Roman velites.

The complex also includes the Ace Dye Works mill on the south side of the river, which has been converted into lofts. A pedestrian skybridge connects the two mills. Site history Royal Mills and dam The complex is located along the banks of the South Branch of the Pawtuxet River in the village of River Point. The site was first used for industrial purposes by the Greene Manufacturing Company, which built a wooden structure in 1809 and two later stone mills. In 1885, the site was purchased by B.B.& R. Knight Co., one of the largest textile companies in Rhode Island at the time, who marketed their cloth under the Fruit of the Loom label. In 1890, the Knight Company razed the three old mills and built the Royal Mill from local granite. The new mill would become one of the largest in the company's empire of 22 mills throughout the region. In 1919, the Royal Mill was destroyed by fire. It was rebuilt a year later in the current configuration, with twin stone towers. In 1921, the Royal Mill was the scene of a huge textile worker strike that lasted 33 weeks. The impact of the strike as well as increased competition from Southern mills led to many mill closures throughout New England during the 1920s. The Royal Mill survived until 1935, when the once mighty B.B.& R. Knight Co. went bankrupt. Between 1936 and 1946 the site was occupied by Saybrooke Manufacturing Co., which produced wool cloth. After this time, and until 2004 the mill was used by a variety of small companies.Royal Mills History Timeline The mill was abandoned and taken over by the town of West Warwick, Rhode Island in 1993, and there was serious consideration for demolishing the structure. Conversion In 2004, the Royal Mill was purchased by Struever Bros. Eccles & Rouse, which began a complete renovation of the site, including the adjacent stone dam, now used to produce hydropower. The Royal Mill now contains 250 apartments, and is the focal point of a revitalized riverfront that contains a public walking path along the river.

Security officials said that his supporters in his stronghold of Khalde blocked the highway leading to the village and fired gunshot rounds in the air to protest Mikati cabinet. Moreover they blocked the international highway leading to Damascus in Mount Lebanon as well as main roads in the Chouf District and in South Lebanon; in Hasbaya. =Post resignation= The resignation of Arslan had a negative effect on the March 8 Alliance that was criticised for letting down Arslan whose party was a major ally in it.

History =Formation and early years (2006‚Äì2007)= Initially a writer and essayist, Jollett began seriously writing songs with an acoustic guitar following a week in March 2006, during which he underwent a break-up, learned his mother had been diagnosed with cancer, and was himself diagnosed with a genetic autoimmune disease that led to the development of two cosmetic conditions: Alopecia areata and Vitiligo. This quick succession of traumatic events spurred a period of intense songwriting, and it was around this time that he first met Taylor through a mutual friend in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ, March 2009 Throughout the summer of 2006, Jollett and Taylor rehearsed several of Jollett's songs, including early incarnations of \\"Wishing Well,\\" \\"Missy,\\" and \\"Innocence,\\" which would eventually appear on the band's debut album. After a few months of rehearsals, Jollett ran into Anna Bulbrook one night at El Gran Burrito, a popular outdoor Mexican restaurant in Silver Lake. Trained in orchestral and chamber music, she had just moved to Los Angeles from New York City. Though they were just acquaintances at the time, he remembered that she played the violin and asked her to attend one of his and Taylor's rehearsals. Afraid to bring her more expensive violin to a rock rehearsal, she agreed to bring her viola instead. Jollett then asked Harmon, a Tucson native and graduate of the Herb Alpert School of Music at the California Institute of the Arts, to join his fledgling band, having seen him perform in Los Angeles with other acts and been impressed with his background in rock and jazz, as well as his skill with the upright bass. At the time, Harmon was performing with multiple rock and jazz bands while teaching guitar to children both in East Los Angeles as part of CalArts' Community Arts Partnership, and at Arroyo Seco Park (Highland Park, CA) as part of its \\"Art in the Park\\" program. He refused at first, and it wasn't until months later‚Äîafter several shows‚Äîthat Harmon agreed to join the group full-time. Chen and Jollett, meanwhile, had already known each other for five years. They first met through a mutual friend while both were living in San Francisco and working as writers. After a few years of living in New York, Chen made a return to his hometown of Los Angeles, upon which Jollett contacted him and asked if he'd be interested in playing the keyboard in the band. Chen replied that he, in fact, played guitar and eventually filled the role as lead guitarist. Prior to the formation of the band, and to supplement his fiction writing, Jollett supported himself as a freelance writer, contributing to NPR, Los Angeles Times, Filter and Men's Health, among other organizations. Soon after the formation of the band, he concentrated only on fiction. In the summer of 2008, McSweeney's issue 27 published one of Jollett's short stories, The Crack, which appeared between short stories by Liz Mandrell and Stephen King. In keeping with his literary background, Jollett named the band after a section of the postmodern novel White Noise by Don DeLillo, which won the National Book Award in 1985. In the book, a chemical spill from a railcar releases a poisonous cloud, dubbed by the military and media as an \\"airborne toxic event.\\" The reason for choosing this as the name of the band, he has stated, is that the event described in the novel triggers a fear of death and a sense of mortality that fundamentally alters the protagonist's outlook on himself, his family, and his life. The band was born of a similar life-altering sequence of events, and thus, the themes of mortality and media consumption that arise from the novel's toxic cloud serve as a major impetus for the band's creative drive. The Airborne Toxic Event played its first show at the Echo, a venue in Echo Park, in October 2006‚Äîless than a month after it was fully formed. The show was well attended, and the following month, the band played the CMJ Music Marathon. In December 2006, Rolling Stone named the group one of the \\"Top 25 Bands on MySpace.\\" The band went on to receive positive feedback and reviews from music blogs and press, most notably the L.A. Weekly and the Los Angeles Times, the latter of which named the group one of the top three L.A. bands to watch in 2008. Previous bands to receive this distinction include Cold War Kids and Silversun Pickups. In the summer of 2007, the U.K. indie label Square Records released a 7-inch single of the Airborne Toxic Event song \\"Does This Mean You Are Moving On?\\" To support the release, the band embarked on a ten-day tour of the U.K., playing shows in London and Brighton. Upon returning, the band recorded 14 tracks with producer Pete Min at his home studio in the Atwater Village, Los Angeles, while continuing to perform around Los Angeles. Ten of the tracks recorded at Min's home would later comprise the band's debut album. In December 2007, the band premiered the song \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" with a live performance of the song on Indie 103.1's local music show Check One Two. In January 2008, the band played a five-show weekly residency presented by Indie 103.1 at the popular Silver Lake venue Spaceland, chronicled in a short YouTube video titled \\"Thursdays in January\\". During the second-to-last week of the residency, Los Angeles commercial radio stations KROQ-FM and Indie 103.1 (KDLD) officially added the as-yet-unsigned band's song \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" to regular rotation. Providence's WBRU, Seattle's KEXP-FM, San Francisco's Live 105 (KITS), San Diego's 91X (XETRA-FM), Boston's WFNX, and Sacramento's KWOD 106.5 soon followed suit, showing significant support for the group. In April 2008, after an extensive courtship from major labels, the Airborne Toxic Event signed with the indie label Majordomo Records, based in Los Angeles. Soon after that, on April 24, the band made its national television debut as the musical guest on the late-night NBC talk show Last Call with Carson Daly. =The Airborne Toxic Event (2008‚Äì2009)= On August 5, 2008, the band released its first full-length album, The Airborne Toxic Event, featuring ten of the 14 songs recorded at Min's home studio at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008. On August 1, coinciding with the release, the group performed \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. The Saint in Asbury Park, NJ, March 2009 The record was received with mostly favorable reviews from such outlets as the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, Q, Entertainment Weekly, and Drowned in Sound, among others. Notably, the Boston Herald named the band's album \\"The Debut Album of the Year.\\" In addition, on December 6, 2008, iTunes named \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" the No. 1 Alternative Song of the Year on their Best of 2008 list. One exception was the review on the music website Pitchfork Media, by Ian Cohen, who gave the record 1.6 out of 10 stars and accused the band of imitating the worst aspects of bands such as Arcade Fire, The Strokes, and Interpol. In response, the band released a statement saying that it does not take reviews too seriously and criticized Pitchfork for basing their critiques on \\"a band's ability to match a certain indie rock aesthetic\\" rather than a band's other merits, and claiming that much of the review \\"reads less like a record review and more like a diatribe against a set of ill-considered and borderline offensive preconceptions about Los Angeles\\". To promote the album, the band released a series of one-take acoustic videos for each song on the record, filmed in different locations around Los Angeles. Each video was released in the order of the track listing on the album each week, with the final video (\\"Innocence\\") released in the first week of August to coincide with the album release. Some of the locations included the Los Angeles River, Griffith Park, and the Colburn School Conservatory of Music. Two of the acoustic videos featured the band performing in moving vehicles; \\"Does This Mean You‚Äôre Moving On?\\" was performed in a car on Sunset Boulevard, while \\"Something New\\" was performed on a boat at Marina Del Rey with Taylor both steering the boat and tapping a snare drum with his free hand. Beginning in July 2008, the band embarked on a series of tours in support of the album, which continued for approximately a year and a half. After touring various summer festivals, the band embarked on a North American tour opening for The Fratellis in the fall of 2008. Following that, the group played its \\"30 Shows in 30 Days\\" tour of the United Kingdom in November, during which it performed 30 nights in a row entirely in England and Scotland. The tour incorporated a month-long residency at the Dublin Castle, located in London's Camden Town. The band has largely attributed its subsequent success in the U.K. to this tour, which also included shows in Derby, York, Birmingham, Northampton, Leicester, Aldershot, Yeovil, Hayle, Southampton, Liverpool, Carlisle, Middlesbrough, Manchester, Hull, Leeds, Oxford, Brighton, Nottingham, Barrow-in-Furness, Stoke-on-Trent, Cardiff, Bristol, Sheffield, Preston, Dundee, Glasgow, and Fife. In January 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event embarked on its first headlining tour, beginning in the U.K., followed by two months in the United States and Canada. Meanwhile, bolstered by an unexpected addition to the playlist at the U.K.‚Äôs BBC Radio 1‚Äîan unusual occurrence for an unsigned American band‚Äîthe group released its debut through an independent distributor in the UK on February 9, 2009. Also during this time, the group began performing on television with the Calder Quartet, a Los Angeles-based string quartet featuring Bulbrook‚Äôs brother on second violin. The quartet had previously played with the band for its record-release show at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles in August 2008, as well as appearing in two of its one-take acoustic videos, for \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" and \\"Innocence\\". They joined the band for three television performances during the first half of 2009, including the Late Show with David Letterman on January 16, 2009, The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on April 14, 2009, and Jimmy Kimmel Live! on May 14, 2009. Soon after the Letterman performance, which garnered worldwide attention, the band's single ‚ÄúSometime Around Midnight\\" entered the top 10 on the US Alternative Radio Chart. The band toured almost constantly for the remainder of the year, throughout North America, the U.K., and continental Europe, performing during the summer at several festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, T in the Park, Fuji Rock, the Reading and Leeds Festivals, Oxegen, Latitude Festival, FM4 Frequency Festival, Pukkelpop, A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise, and the Sasquatch! Music Festival. The group's final tour for its debut album began on September 17, 2009 in Pomona, California and concluded in Oxford, U.K. on November 14. By the end of 2009, \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" was the No. 10 Most Played Song at Alternative Radio for the year. It peaked at No. 4 and sold over 400,000 copies in the US. The band's debut album spent 8 weeks at No. 1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart (53 weeks in total on the chart) and has sold over 200,000 copies domestically and 300,000 worldwide. Due to this constant touring Jollett admitted that his writing career had to be put on hold. While he was writing an original novel in the early years of the formation of the band, the stresses and time constraint of touring made it nearly impossible to continue his current works. The group made five music videos for the album: \\"Does This Mean You‚Äôre Moving On?\\", directed by Jason Wishnow; \\"Happiness is Overrated\\", directed by Jon Danovic; \\"Gasoline\\", directed by Billy Johnson; and \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\", for which there were two separate videos, directed by Wishnow and D. J. Caruso. In early March 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event signed with Island Records. On March 10, 2009, during a live radio broadcast with U2 at the Metro Chicago, host Shirley Manson of Garbage asked the band to name some of its favorite songs. Bassist Adam Clayton chose \\"Sometime Around Midnight\\" as one of his selections, commenting that he felt he would be listening to their album the rest of the year. During its U2 360¬∞ Tour, U2 made a habit of playing a recording of the song in stadiums before taking the stage. On May 20, 2009, an entire episode of Last Call with Carson Daly was devoted to the Airborne Toxic Event, featuring interviews and excerpts from a show at the Glass House in Pomona, California. On December 4, 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event played its final show in support of its debut album, giving a sold-out performance at the Frank Gehry-designed Walt Disney Concert Hall in Downtown Los Angeles. The show was presented by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and was the last of 354 shows performed by the band on its debut album cycle. The group was accompanied by the Calder Quartet, the Lalo Guerrero Children's choir, The Belmont High School marching band, Mexican Baile Folklorico dancers, and a number of guest musicians, including horn players and an accordionist. =\\"Neda\\", All I Ever Wanted: Live from Walt Disney Concert Hall (2010)= On June 7, 2010, the Airborne Toxic Event released a song and video titled \\"Neda,\\" in recognition of the one-year anniversary of the Death of Neda Agha-Soltan, the young Iranian woman who was killed during the protests of the disputed 2009 presidential election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Iran. In conjunction with Amnesty International, the band also launched a website, nedaspeaks.org, to raise awareness about Agha-Soltan's death and the human rights struggle in Iran. The music video features a series of animated stills depicting the events surrounding Agha-Soltan's death, interspersed with text. Concert in Asbury Park, NJ, March 2009 As part of its website, the band encouraged visitors to submit a photo of themselves holding a sign reading \\"I am Neda.\\" Celebrities who participated in the project include Alyssa Milano, Paul Haggis, and Ne-Yo, among others. All proceeds from the sale of the single on iTunes were donated to Amnesty International. In addition, the band held a benefit concert at the Echo in Los Angeles on May 25, 2010. One of the attendees at the show was Jimmy Delshad, mayor of Beverly Hills and the highest-ranking Iranian American elected official in the United States. On July 14, 2010, the band announced the release of the documentary DVD and CD All I Ever Wanted: Live From Walt Disney Concert Hall, on September 7, 2010 in North America and October 4, 2010 in Europe. The North American release date was later moved to September 29, 2010. The film premiered at the Vista Theatre in the Los Feliz, Los Angeles on September 2, 2010, at the Sunshine Theater in New York on September 9, and at the Raindance Film Festival in London on September 30. The film, directed by Danovic, features the Airborne Toxic Event's December 4, 2009 Walt Disney Concert Hall performance in its entirety, interspersed with a behind-the-scenes narrative chronicling the band's extensive preparations for the show. The non-concert footage includes extensive rehearsals with the Calder Quartet, the Belmont High School marching band, and the Lalo Guerrero children's choir. Stylistically, the film splices rehearsal footage with concert footage for most of the songs performed, in addition to switching between black-and-white and color video. The performance features non-album tracks, including the title track \\"All I Ever Wanted,\\" \\"A Letter to Georgia,\\" \\"Duet,\\" and \\"This Losing.\\" It also includes cover versions of \\"Goodbye Horses,\\" by Q Lazzarus, \\"The Book of Love\\" by The Magnetic Fields, and \\"Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?\\" by the Ramones. The DVD release also includes an additional CD containing an audio recording of the entire concert. In support of the DVD release, the group spent September and October 2010 on a sold-out, three-week North American and U.K. acoustic tour, with the Calder Quartet joining them for the North American leg of the tour. They performed at a series of non-traditional venues, including the Sixth & I Synagogue in Washington D.C., Town Hall in New York, Trinity Church in Toronto, the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Los Angeles, and the Union Chapel in London. In John Earls News of the World review of the Union Chapel show, he wrote \\"Debuting seven terrific new songs to make the heart soar, Toxic's stirring tunes certainly get in the bloodstream.\\" =All at Once (2011‚Äì2012)= The Airborne Toxic Event's second album, All at Once, was released on April 25, 2011 in Europe, and April 26 in North America. Written during the latter half of 2009 and most of 2010, the record was produced in Los Angeles by Dave Sardy, who also produced albums by Oasis, Band of Horses, LCD Soundsystem, Wolfmother, and Autolux. An acoustic version of one of the songs from the album, \\"Half of Something Else,\\" appeared on the soundtrack for the film Going the Distance, directed by Nanette Burstein and starring Drew Barrymore and Justin Long. On January 22, 2011, the band played a concert with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra at Boettcher Concert Hall in Denver, debuting orchestral arrangements of songs from All at Once, in addition to those from the first record. Previously, it performed with the Louisville Orchestra at The Kentucky Center for the Performing Arts‚Äô Whitney Hall on January 30, 2010, as part of the orchestra's \\"BB&T; Strings Attached\\" series. Mikel & Anna - Ace of Spades venue in Sacramento, CA, June 2011 On February 1, 2011, the Airborne Toxic Event released two separate first singles from the album in North America and Europe, respectively. In North America, the single was \\"Changing\\", while in Europe, it was \\"Numb\\". In its October 9, 2010 issue, Music Week wrote, \\"The LA group's new material is the sound of a band defining their identity. Produced by Dave Sardy, this is confident, ambitious and radio- friendly.\\" Also on February 1, 2011, the band embarked on a one-month tour of continental Europe, composed partly of three simultaneous musical residencies in Amsterdam (Mondays), Berlin (Tuesdays), and Paris (Fridays). Other cities visited on the tour, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, were Antwerp, M√ºnster, Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, and Zurich. In addition, the band played HMV Group's Next Big Thing music festival at Heaven in London on February 10. As a follow-up to the series of one-take acoustic videos released in the lead- up to its first album, the group announced the \\"Bombastic\\" on February 15, 2011‚Äîa series of similar one-take acoustic videos of all the songs from All at Once, directed by Danovic. As with the first series, the band indicated that it would release one video each week. The first video released was a performance of All at Once‚Äôs title track, featuring the Calder Quartet, the Lalo Guerrero School of Music children's choir, and music students from the Plaza de la Raza Community Center in East Los Angeles. On February 22, the Airborne Toxic Event released its second \\"Bombastic\\" video, a performance of the song \\"All for a Woman\\" inside the First Baptist Church in Koreatown, Los Angeles. The March 2nd release featured a slightly different arrangement of \\"All I Ever Wanted,\\" performed with the Calder Quartet at the Colburn School Conservatory of Music. On March 9, 16, 22, and 30 and April 7, 13, 20, and 27 the band released acoustic versions of \\"It Doesn't Mean a Thing\\", \\"Welcome to Your Wedding Day\\", \\"The Kids Are Ready to Die\\", \\"Strange Girl\\", \\"Changing\\", \\"Numb\\", \\"Half of Something Else\\", and \\"The Graveyard Near the House\\", respectively. On March 4, 2011, the Airborne Toxic Event released two music videos for its singles \\"Changing\\" and \\"Numb,\\" both from All at Once. Both were directed by Danovic. The video for \\"Changing\\" features members of the Strikers All-Stars, a Los Angeles-based dance crew known for its community outreach, as well as collaborations with artists such as Rihanna and Lil Wayne. The video for \\"Numb\\" premiered on MTV UK. Following a showcase in March at Stubb's BBQ for 2011's South by Southwest music conference, the band embarked on a North American and European tour in support of All at Once, which began on April 4 in Nottingham, UK. Of these, 15 shows constituted what the band dubbed the \\"Origins Tour,\\" consisting of five shows each in London, Los Angeles, and New York. Beginning with the smallest venues in each city, these 15 dates encompassed a range of differently sized venues in which the group has played since its inception. For the North American leg that followed, the tour's opening slot was filled by Voxhaul Broadcast, from Los Angeles, and then later by Mona from Nashville. The tour concluded on June 16 in Sacramento, CA. The band appeared in the season finale of Gossip Girl, ‚ÄúThe Wrong Goodbye‚Äù, which aired on May 16, playing \\"All for a Woman\\" and \\"Changing\\". Reaching No. 4 on the Alternative Song charts, \\"Changing\\" was also featured, throughout June and July, on a television trailer for Crazy, Stupid, Love, starring Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling. On July 26, 2011 the group announced its Fall World Tour, with dates in North America and Europe, beginning on October 9 in Denver and concluding on December 6 in Tempe, AZ.

It was subsequently announced on the band's website on February 5, 2014, that Ashley Dzerigian had unforeseen circumstances that would prevent her from joining the tour. The new replacement for Noah Harmon is Adrian Rodriguez. As of August 5, 2014 Noah has confirmed via his personal Instagram that he has been fired from The Airborne Toxic Event with a message in which he simply stated \\"I got fired. 7 years, 0 regrets. Good luck\\". On October 3, 2014, the band premiered \\"Wrong\\", the lead single off their fourth studio album, on Philadelphia radio station Radio 104.5. It was later confirmed on the site of San Diego radio station 91X that the upcoming album would be titled Dope Machines. On February 23, 2015, a day before the release of Dope Machines, the band announced via their Facebook page that they'd be releasing a second album the next day, in addition to Dope Machines, titled Songs of God and Whiskey. The second album would be acoustic and focus more on rock and roll than the electronic synth pop in Dope Machines. The album would be composed of songs written throughout the ten years before the album's release. In October 2016, the band released a new single titled \\"America\\" in preparation for their 2017 tour. =Hollywood Park (2018‚Äìpresent)= In September 2019, it was announced that Anna Bulbrook would be leaving the band, and that the band had been working on a new project.

The site was advantageously located on what was then the main road between Providence and Plainfield, Connecticut. The tavern was a center of civic discourse, and town meetings were regularly held there until 1835.

After outliving its use as a fire station, the building was used as the offices of social service agencies and the municipal employees' credit union. Since the district's listing on the NRHP, this building has been demolished. =Henry Warner Budlong Memorial Library, 3267 Post Road= This building, now the Apponaug branch of the Warwick Public Library, was built in 1924-25 to serve as the home of the Apponaug Free Library Association. The money for the construction was given by Henry W. Budlong, a prominent local philanthropist. It was designed by the Providence firm of Hoppin, Field & Peirce in a very plain version of the Classical Revival style. The building's front entrance was originally ornamented by two Tuscan columns, but these were removed sometime in the 1970s. The original doors have also been replaced, but the ormantal hood still remains. Architect Howard Hoppin was also the architect of the nearby St. Barnabas Episcopal Church, several years before.American Contractor 6 Oct. 1917: 58. Chicago. =Warwick City Hall, 3275 Post Road= This, the largest building in the district, was also designed by William R. Walker & Son. It replaced an assortment of town buildings, which were built in 1834-35 in the Greek Revival style. The building, designed in the Queen Anne and Colonial Revival styles, is an important local landmark. When the towns of Warwick and West Warwick were split, it was one of two major buildings of contention in the proceedings. Warwick kept the Town Hall, while West Warwick, the denser of the towns, kept the former High School. In 1929 the town built an addition on the rear of the building, to contain the city archives. This was designed by Jackson, Robertson & Adams.Map catalog-2.pdf On the grounds is the city's World War I memorial, dedicated in 1919 and designed by Warwick sculptor John G. Hardy, who was also commissioned for memorials in North Providence as well as in Templeton, Massachusetts.\\"Some Recent Public Memorials\\". Monumental News March 1922: 164. Madison, Wisconsin.

It was opened on 3 July 1933. After serving as a cinema for many years it now hosts performances of classical Thai dance. History Construction of Sala Chalermkrung theatre was sponsored by King Prajadhipok as part of the celebrations in 1932 to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of Bangkok. The name Sala Chalermkrung derives from this, meaning 'Pavilion to Celebrate the City'. The King was himself an enthusiastic supporter of movies and invested 9,000,000 Baht of his personal funds to construct the theatre. The King chose as the architect for the project Mom Chao Samaichaloem Kridakorn who was at that time Chief Master Builder at the Department of Outer Palace. This was a bold choice since Kridakorn had only recently graduated in Beaux-Arts Architecture and such important roles had previously always been filled by Europeans. Prince Purachatra Jayakara a senior member of the Royal Family was appointed as the construction director and the Bangkok Dock Company was selected as the construction contractor. Phraya Sripipat Rattanarat Kosathipbodi (M. R. Mul Darakorn), the Director-General of the Department of Privy Purse, chose the site for the theatre at the intersection of Charoengkrung Road and Tripet Road in Wang Burapha area, the centre of the Capital's commercial district at that time. Royal Theatre at night Bangkok's first movie screening took place in June 1897. and subsequently cinema became immensely popular in the Capital. However the movie houses were notorious for their squalor and disorderly behaviour. The Sala Chalermkrung theatre was therefore intended to provide Bangkok citizens with a clean, orderly and modern cinema. Built in Modernist style the theatre was equipped with the latest sound and lighting system, designed by Siamese engineer, Phraya Prakopyantrakit (Yon Yaiprayun). The neon lights on the top of the front facade displaying in Thai the name Sala Chalerm Krung were the largest in Asia. Plus the theatre was equipped with modern air- conditioning, a new experience for many Siamese at the time. The main auditorium seated 1,500 patrons whilst there was a smaller 350 seat auditorium plus private rooms for royal screenings as well as dance rooms and a dining salon. The theatre opened to massive crowds on 2 July 1933. By this time however, the Siamese revolution of 1932 had displaced the king from his absolutist position and the opening was therefore presided over by Phraya Sripipat Rattanarat Kosathipbodi rather than the King himself. The cinema was operated by the Saha Cinema Company which had been established by the King himself but in post-revolution Siam control soon fell under the new government. King Prajadhipok is believed to have visited the theatre himself only twice. Renovation After a long period of neglect and decline Sala Chalerm Krung was renovated in 1992. With the intended emphasis on traditional theatre rather than movies, the stage was widened and an hydraulic stage lift system installed. This has reduced seating to 600.

This was done in the place of an original church from 1783, which was smaller and had no tower. Description The church is a rectangular building, reconstructed in 1927, specific for its simple classical expression and a portal under the tower. The tower with a four-faced (functional) clock is terminated with a high roof. From three sides, the interior of the church is lined with a choir, resting on columns. The entrance area is adorned by an oil painting of Mo≈°ovce from the 19th century and the main nave hosts a painting depicting the last supper. The church's furnishings include an electrical organ, glass chandeliers and an altar with a pulpit. The rear part of the church contains 3 pronouncedly vertically elongated arch painted-glasswindows depicting biblical motives. Between 1973 ‚Äì 1975 a general reconstruction of the church was performed, allowing for the exchange of the benches, windows, choirs, as well as the altar and pulpit. Following reconstructions of the outer facade took place at the beginning of the 1990s and thereafter at around 2005. The reason for the relatively frequent reconstructions was the material used for the construction of the church, containing substances constantly penetrating the plaster up to its surface and degrading it strongly. In the past, damage was visible especially during humid weather. After the last reconstruction, the condition of the church seems to be stable. Bells The tower's belfry hosts three church bells of various size. In addition to their basic purpose, calling church-members for service, the bells fulfill yet another function by announcing the death of the town residents according to the following formula: * a period of tolling on a single bell followed by a pause - all repeated twice: death of a woman * a period of tolling on a single bell followed by a pause - all repeated three times: death of a man * these periods, called the pulsing are followed by the tolling of all three bells. * the above formula is used on the day, when the person in question had died. Thereafter, every day until the funeral, all three bells are tolled at a given hour. * similarly, all the bells toll at one year's anniversary of a person's death. * originally, the size of the tolling bell was selected according to the age of the deceased: the smallest one in case of the death of a child, the middle one upon the passing of an adult, and the largest one when the deceased was an elderly - today, this tradition is no longer observed. Originally, until the beginning of the 1990s, the bells also announced the time using chimes of the smallest bell: * 1 chime : quarter past * 2 chimes: half past * 3 chimes: quarter to * 4 chimes: whole hour; whereas after a short pause followed another series of chimes corresoding to the current hour * tolling of all bells also marked the morning at 6:00 a.m., the noon at 12:00 p.m. and night at 18:00 p.m.  See also  * Church of Holy Trinity in Mo≈°ovce * Mo≈°ovce  Sources  * LIPPAN, M. a kol.: Mo≈°ovce.

The abstraction process to generate architectural elements frequently involves clustering source code entities (such as files, classes, functions etc.) into subsystems according to a set of criteria that can be application dependent or not. Architecture recovery from legacy systems is motivated by the fact that these systems do not often have an architectural documentation, and when they do, this documentation is many times out of synchronization with the implemented system. Software architecture recovery may be required as part of software retrofits.  Approaches  Most approaches to software architecture recovery has been exploring the static analysis of systems. When considering object-oriented software, which employs a lot of polymorphism and dynamic binding mechanisms, dynamic analysis becomes an essential technique to comprehend the system behavior, object interactions, and hence to reconstruct its architecture. In this work, the criteria used to determine how source code entities should be clustered in architectural elements are mainly based on the dynamic analysis of the system, taking into account the occurrences of interaction patterns and types (classes and interfaces) in use-case realizations.

Relations with Sandinistas  The USSR developed great relations with the Sandinistas after the overthrow of the Somoza family. During the 1980s, the Soviet Union provided full political, economic, military, and diplomatic support to the left wing government of Nicaragua. This was not only a reaction to the Contra resistance movement but a full-fledged alliance with Soviet Union, which provided free credit, economic subsidies and heavy weapon grants. The Nicaraguans got at no cost armaments such as heavily armed MI-24 attack helicopters (Hinds), and Mi-17 transport helicopters. Nicaragua voted consistently for Communist causes during the 1980s. Cuban army and political delegates, subsidized by Russian money, were permanently staffed in Nicaragua, making the country a member of the Communist bloc. After Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega returned to power in 2007 Russia took over the patron role for Nicaragua Nicaragua was the second country after Russia to recognize the disputed territories of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In September 2008, perhaps in response to Nicaragua's support over the breakaway Georgian territories, Russia offered to strengthen ties with Nicaragua and to provide aid to Nicaragua to help rebuild areas damaged by hurricanes. In December 2008, Russian warships visited Nicaragua at the invitation of president Daniel Ortega, although Wilfredo Navarro of the opposition Constitutionalist Liberal Party said that without parliamentary approval the naval visit would be a breach of the Constitution. During the visit, Russian officials donated about $200,000 worth of generators and computers to hospitals, police, and the army. Shortly after, on December 18, 2008, Russia and Nicaragua concluded several bilateral agreements after talks between presidents Dmitry Medvedev and Daniel Ortega in Moscow, including Memorandums of understanding between the countries' agriculture ministries, and between the Russian Federal Space Agency and Nicaragua's Telecommunications and Postal Service Institute. Russian support has become more important to Nicaragua following withdrawal in late 2008 of US and European aid due to concerns about electoral fraud and handling of human rights and democracy. In April 2009, Nicaragua dropped the requirement for Russian tourists to obtain visas. On July 12, 2014, Vladimir Putin made an Official State Visit to Nicaragua. held a meeting in Managua with President of Nicaragua Daniel Ortega.

Karl Gustaf in Nordisk familjebok, vol. 23 (1916) Career Roos started as a 16-year-old page at the court of Charles XII in 1700, then accompanied the king during the Great Northern War and participated in a number of battles. He was wounded at Klisz√≥w and Fraustadt, was appointed second lieutenant in the S√∂dermanland Regiment and, in 1707, lieutenant in the N√§rke-V√§rmland Regiment. He was appointed to the ‚Äùcorps of Drabants‚Äù in 1708 and accompanied the king to Bendery. There he excelled himself being cited for brilliant bravery in the skirmish at Bender and saved the king's life three times in one day, including protecting the king with his own body. Roos gave a detailed account of the skirmish at Bender in a letter which he personally delivered to the Swedish Queen Ulrika Eleonora. The account was printed in 1757 and has since been reprinted on several occasions. The letter is considered to have great historical value and the original is kept in the National Archives of Sweden. Roos was appointed Adjutant General in 1713 and on the very same day as colonel in the South Scanian cavalry. Over the following years, Roos was employed by the king in several demanding and secret missions. During one such trip in 1716, he was captured by the Danish enemy, but managed to escape to Scania. He also participated in the 1718 siege of the Fredriksten fortress in Norway, during which the king was killed. Roos was wounded 16 times in the Great Northern War campaign. The king had great confidence in him and called him \\"Roosen\\", and he was almost always in the king's immediate proximity during the war. In 1725 he was promoted to major general and colonel of the Nyland cavalry brigade and the Tavastehus dragoons. In 1728, he was instead given command of the Bohus dragoons. In 1740, after a stint as military commander, he was appointed governor of √Ñlvsborg County, finally retiring as a lieutenant general. He lived at L√∂v√•s manor and died there, 81 years old, in 1766. His funeral assembled a large number of the most prominent nobles in the country. There, his life was described in a long speech by the member of parliament for V√§rmland, Lennart Magnus Uggla. The speech was distributed in printed form with the title: \\"√Öminnelsetal √∂fver General, landsh√∂fdingen mm Baron Axel Erik Roos.\\" It is considered that the man \\"Axel\\" in Esaias Tegn√©r's eponymous poem is Erik Axel Roos. The noble house of Roos came to an end with his death. Roos' sword and spurs were stored for nearly two hundred years in the church of Gestad until they were stolen in the 1980s during a burglary. They have not been recovered since. Personal life Axel Roos was the son of General Carl Gustaf Roos and is known among other things, for his command of an infantry unit during the battle of Poltava. Two of his sons were killed serving as officers during campaigns in Poland and Germany. It is said that Erik Axel Roos was not tall and that he kept his youthful looks to the end of his life. There are several paintings of him, including one in Karlberg Palace, Stockholm.

They were one of five founding members of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, but reached the knockout stages just once in four years of competing. After a three-year hiatus, the side played their final NSL season in 2012‚Äì13, where they finished bottom of the league.  History  = Foundation and early years = The club was founded as Welgris Momads sometime at the start of the 21st century, as their first season on record came in 2001 when they took part in the Mount Hagen Regional League. Among seven participants they were the eventual champions. Two years later, they competed in both the Highlands Regional Championship and the Papua New Guinea National Club Championship, but failed to make an impact on either competition. In 2005, the side took part in both the Highlands Regional Championship the National Club Championship for the second time. The club fared much better in both competitions, winning the Highlands competition with a 3‚Äì1 victory over Blue Kumuls Mount Hagen in the final on 22 August, before meeting Blue Kumuls again in the third-place playoff of the National Club Championship, this time winning 3‚Äì0. = National Soccer League debut = From 18‚Äì21 May 2006, the side took part in the Highlands Regional Championship once again, reaching the final where they were set to play Blue Kumuls once again. However, the result of the final is unknown. Despite this, both sides were eligible for the 2006 National Club Championship, but Momads withdrew, and instead entered the inaugural season of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League. Despite defeating eventual champions Hekari United 1‚Äì0 early in the season, they picked up just two wins from eight matches and finished bottom of the table, being the only side to fail to make the playoffs. The following season, the side changed their name to Welgris Highlanders and entered the competition again. Among seven teams they finished 5th again, narrowly missing out on playoff qualification by two points. The side did, however, win the Fair Play Award. The 2007 Highlands Regional Championship was delayed to March 2008, with the final, once more against Blue Kumuls Mount Hagen, was due to be completed on 30 March 2008. However, the final wasn't played after an appeal was lodged regarding the eligibility of National Soccer League players participating in the tournament. The club entered the eight-team 2008‚Äì09 season and finished third in the league table, qualifying for the playoffs for what would prove to be the first and last time. The side came up against champions Hekari in the semi-final, losing 1‚Äì0, before preparing to head to the Lloyd Robson Oval in Port Moresby on 21 March 2009 for the third-place match against University Inter, who had finished second in the table. However, after two postponements, the NSL board eventually cancelled both the third- place match and the final, leaving Welgris technically in 4th behind Inter due to their inferior regular season record. Ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, it was reported that the side had merged with Rapatona FC, and for three years the Welgris Highlanders name would not be seen in domestic competition. On 14 April 2010, it was reported that the club was now defunct. = NSL return and disappearance = Towards the end of 2012, it was reported that the side were making a return to the National Soccer League ahead of the delayed 2013 season. Indeed, the side were one of the eight teams taking part, but won just one match from 14 and finished bottom of the table. In October 2013, the side revealed they would be withdrawing from the upcoming 2014 season because the costs for taking part were too high, citing a change in the competition format as one of the primary reasons for this. It is assumed that the side disbanded shortly afterwards.

The original co-founders of the Chicano/Latino Film Forum were Alex Avila , Cristina Ibarra , and Rene Renteria . The original purpose of the organization was to promote Latino filmmaking and to bring filmmakers and audiences together on a regular basis to view media projects largely unavailable to an audience hungry for such programming.Austin American- Statesman (02/05/1994) Seldom were films programmed for audience screening without the presence of at least one of the principal filmmakers. Over the course of the life of the project, the Chicano/Latino Film Forum presented the works of such film personalities as Carlos Avila, Jesse Borrego, Hector Galan, Nancy de los Santos, Efraim Gutierrez, and many others. In 1996, co-founder Cristina Ibarra left the group and named Sandra Guardado as her replacement as a co-director with Avila and Renteria. The Chicano/Latino Film Forum was active at a time when Austin was emerging as a viable independent, regional film scene thanks to the success of such Austin-based filmmakers as Richard Linklater (\\"Slacker\\" and \\"Dazed and Confused\\") and Robert Rodriguez (\\"El Mariachi\\").Daily Variety, July 30, 1999 (Holly Willis) Other Austin-based film organizations that emerged at the time include the Austin Film Society, Reel Women, Austin Filmworks, and the Austin Cinemaker Co-Op. From its inception, the directors reached out to other filmmaking communities and Latino festivals. The Chicano/Latino Film Forum provided judges for the first ever South By Southwest Film Festival. And group members helped to program some aspects of other Latino film festivals such as CineFestival in San Antonio , CineSol in the South Texas Valley , and Cine Las Americas in Austin.Austin American-Statesman (Texas)April 24, 1998, p. E1 By 1999, the emergence of viable web video, and the growth of Cine Las Americas, a locally based Latin American Film Festival, (mostly Latin American imports) made the need for the Chicano/Latino Film Festival less imperative and the volunteer directors quietly dissolved the group.

He said that the Troglodytae were the swiftest runners of all humans known and that they ate snakes, lizards, and other reptiles. He also stated that their language was unlike any known to him, and sounded like the screeching of bats.Herodotus, Histories, 4.183 Alice Werner (1913) believed (in passing) that this was a clear allusion to the early Khoisan, indigenous inhabitants of Southern Africa, because their languages contain distinctive click sounds. =In Strabo= In his work Geographica, Strabo mentions a tribe of Troglodytae living along with the Crobyzi in Scythia Minor, near the Ister (Danube) and the Greek colonies of Callatis and Tomis. =In Pomponius Mela= In his work Chorographia, Pomponius Mela mentions that they own no resources, and rather than speak, they make a high-pitched sound. They creep around deep in caves and are nurtured by serpents.Pomponius Mela, Chorographia, 1.44 =In Athenaeus= In his work Deipnosophists, Athenaeus wrote that Pythagoras who wrote about the Red Sea mentioned that they make their pandura out of the white mangrove which grows in the seaAthenaeus, Deipnosophists, 4.184 and that Euphorion in his book on the Isthmian Games mentioned that they played sambucas with four strings like the Parthians.Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, 14.34 =In Claudius Aelianus= In his work On the Characteristics of Animals, Claudius Aelianus mentions that the tribe of Troglodytae are famous and derive their name from their manner of living. He also adds that they eat snakes. Furthermore, he wrote that Troglodytes believe that the king of the beasts is the Ethiopian Bull, because it possesses the courage of a lion, the speed of a horse, the strength of a bull, and is stronger than iron.Aelian, Characteristics of Animals, 17.45 =In Josephus= Flavius Josephus alludes to a place he calls Troglodytis while discussing the account in Genesis, that after the death of Sarah, Abraham married Keturah and fathered six sons who in turn fathered many more. \\"Now, for all these sons and grandsons, Abraham contrived to settle them in colonies; and they took possession of Troglodytis, and the country of Arabia Felix...\\"Josephus Flavius, Antiquities, 1.15.1 The Troglodytis Josephus refers to here is generally taken to mean both coasts of the Red Sea.Saint Jerome's Hebrew Questions on Genesis However, Josephus goes on to state that the descendants of one of these grandsons, Epher, invaded Libya, and that the name of Africa was thus derived from that of Epher.

The company is developing a new class of optical devices based on twisting glass optical fibers. These in-fiber devices aim to displace discrete optical elements such as lasers, filters and sensors. They benefit from optical fiber‚Äôs transmission efficiency, robustness and ease of integration. The company hopes that its manufacturing process, which is completely automated and scalable, will result, for example, in communications lasers that are fraction of the cost and three times more efficient than today‚Äôs semiconductor lasers. Chiral Photonics is also developing chirality in polymeric thin films which, for instance, would enable high quality projection displays. Funding Chiral Photonics had received funding from venture capital, angel, and government sources including a US$2 million National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Technology Program award in 2004. Technology Chiral Photonics‚Äô technology is an outgrowth of the 1997 discovery by two of the company's co-founders, Azriel Genack and Victor Kopp, that lasing in cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) films is a result of their unique self-assembling helical (chiral) microstructure. CLCs are the thin-film material often used to fabricate fish tank thermometers or mood rings, that change color with temperature changes. They change color because their molecules are arranged in a helical or chiral arrangement and with temperature the pitch of that helical structure changes, reflecting different wavelengths of light. Drs. Genack and Kopp decided to pursue the possibility that CLCs, with their natural chiral structure, could provide a platform for a versatile new class of photonic devices. In biomimetic fashion, Chiral Photonics has abstracted the self-assembled structure of the organic CLCs to produce analogous optical devices using tiny lengths of inorganic, twisted fiber. Designing novel microforming towers, the company is able to fabricate devices based on fibers that can be twisted through more than 25,000 revolutions over a one-inch length. These revolutions function as would a fiber Bragg grating. The density of twists per inch, or periodicity, demonstrably results in the light being coupled to the fiber cladding, scattered out of the fiber, or reflected back within the fiber. This interaction with light can be harnessed to produce sensors, polarizers/isolators, and filter/lasers, respectively. Applications These basic components can be used for a variety of applications and all share a common production platform. In his comments upon the grant‚Äôs award, William Sargeant, the National Science Foundation program officer who oversaw Chiral Photonics' first SBIR award, noted the range of existing and incipient markets. \\"This technology could be one of the most significant recent advances in the field of polarization and wavelength control. There is an enormous host of applications for which chiral fiber gratings could find markets.\\" Chiral Photonics‚Äô components are all of the all- fiber variety. Released products include linear and circular polarizers, ultra-high temperature sensors, customized harsh environment pressure, axial rotation, and liquid level sensors, and a spot size converting interconnect. The spot size converter, while not of chiral geometry, leverages the company‚Äôs glass microfabrication knowhow. The spot size converter (SSC) couples light between widely disparate (NA and MFD) components, such as, between <25 micrometre planar waveguides or laser diodes, and standard 125 micrometre SMF fiber. The SSC allows for direct light coupling with no air gap, sub-0.5 dB loss, and extinction ratios of >20 dB for use in silicon photonics and other applications. Chiral Photonics also offers twisted capillary tubes for proteomic analysis. The protein unfolds as it passes through the channel allowing for imaging. In other uses the rotation of the protein as it passes through the channel facilitates 360¬∞ imaging. The capillary tubes also have other microfluidic applications including mixing and uniform heat exchange. Patents Chiral Photonics has been issued 19 United States or International patents relating to its photonics research.

The Russian Orthodox Church in America, in its predecessor body, chose not to be a member of the Standing Conference of the Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas. The Russian Orthodox Church in America is a walled off Church that holds a policy like other Churches listed as in resistance, communing the faithful but not con-celebrating among the other Local Churches. The Russian Orthodox Church in America's status is unclear to most Orthodox hierarchs and clergy, although many ROCIA faithful and priests have been received into other Orthodox Churches including the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), the Orthodox Church in America (OCA). As the hierarchs of the Russian Orthodox Church in America do not seek to con-celebrate with the hierarchs of other Churches (in fact avoiding sacerdotal contact, seeking to remain walled off), the exact standing of ROCIA's hierarchs remains unclear. The bishops belonging to the Synod and the historical founders of the Russian Orthodox Church in America are considered to be episcopi vagantes by many, although they are never listed in any reliable list of such bishops and have been historically recognized as \\"canonical\\" Orthodox bishops. The Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church in America views the subject of canonicity differently than the viewpoint of the major Orthodox Churches in the United States. Although invited to join the Standing Conference of Orthodox Bishops in the early 1960s, the Synod maintains that since it was given sole oversight of the Orthodox Christians in the Western Hemisphere, it cannot yield that responsibility by joining what is merely a working group. Metropolitan Symeon, Archbishop of Denver and the West currently chairs the Holy Synod, being the successor of Metropolitan Vladimir of the Carolinas, who is retired. Metropolitan Symeon was consecrated by Archbishop Paul of Philadelphia with the assistance of all the members of the Church's Holy Synod in Delaware in June 1988 and enthroned as Primate by the Holy Synod meeting in South Carolina in June 1989. As its Autonomy/Autocephaly was not recognized at the time of its creation, the Russian Orthodox Church in America remains unrecognized by most other Orthodox Churches.

It stars John Nettles as Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby and Daniel Casey as Detective Sergeant Gavin Troy. Synopsis The Midsomer Wellow bell-ringing band is stalked by an elusive serial killer on the eve of a major tournament. A cute new member distracts some of the bell ringers of Midsomer Wellow from concentrating on the upcoming striking competition, but they still manage to place a group bet on a horse called Ring-A-Ding, which wins them 30,000 pounds. This combination of gambling and church bell ringing enrages some portions of the village. When one of the ringers is found in the tower, shot through the heart and clutching the ironic words \\"Ding Dong Bell\\", Barnaby isn't amused. As another murder takes place, Chief Inspector Barnaby wonders if he should be looking for a maniac, or the rather more rational nemesis of a rival team. Murders Throughout the episode, there are 4 murders, one of which is historical. There is also a death by natural causes. #Greg Tutt: Lured to his death by a letter supposedly from another character asking to meet at the bell tower, then shot through the heart. #Emma Tysoe: Shot through the heart on the day of her wedding. #Marcus Steadman: Fears that he is being followed which brings on a panic attack, inflaming his asthma. After collapsing on a footbridge he is then pushed in a river with a walking stick, where he subsequently drowns. #The Reverend Jonathan Ebbrel : This murder takes place in 1860. The legend goes that the bellringers murdered him and hid his body in a well because he imposed strict rules on the bell ringers. Other deaths Reggie Barton: Dies of natural causes in his sleep.

Her first name is unknown, though a number of genealogies have assigned her the name Eudoxie (Eudoxia).The Capetians-Courtenay The name is possibly a confusion with Eudokia Laskarina, a Byzantine princess that was previously betrothed to Robert, whose name is Latinized to Eudoxia. Family According to William of Tyre Continuator, a 13th-century continuation of the chronicle of William of Tyre, the Lady was a daughter of Baldwin of Neuville in Artois.There are many places in France called Neuville. The ancient County of Arras lies within the modern Pas-de- Calais department. There are five places called Neuville in Pas-de-Calais: Neuville-au-Cornet, Neuville-Bourjonval, Neuville-Saint-Vaast, Neuville-sous- Montreuil and Neuville-Vitasse. There seems no reason to prefer any one of them over the others as her birthplace. Her mother is mentioned but not named. Her further ancestry is unknown, though presumed to be French. Empress Robert of Courtenay had been crowned emperor on 25 March 1221. According to George Acropolites he was betrothed to Eudokia Laskarina in 1221. She was a daughter of Theodore I Laskaris and Anna Komnene Angelina. Eudokia was also a younger sister to both Irene Lascarina, wife of John III Doukas Vatatzes and Maria Laskarina, wife of B√©la IV of Hungary. However the marriage was opposed by Patriarch Manuel I of Constantinople on grounds of consanguinity. Though not actually closely related by blood, Eudokia was a stepdaughter of Marie de Courtenay who was third wife of Theodore I and sister to Robert.George Acropolites, Chronicle, chapters 18-22 Eudokia was already present in Constantinople. She had been taken there by her paternal uncles Alexios and Isaac Laskaris who had left the Empire of Nicaea following the death of Theodore I. Both uncles joined the military service of the Latin Empire. According to Acropolites, they co-led a Latin force into Bithynia during 1224. They were defeated by their kinsman John III Doukas Vatatzes, captured and blinded.George Acropolites, Chronicle, chapters 22 For some reason the marriage contract with Eudokia was never completed. According to Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Eudokia was betrothed (or married) to Frederick II, Duke of Austria in 1226.Alberic of Trois-Fontaines, Chronica Alberici Monachi Trium Fontium, MGH SS XXIII The marriage contract was broken or the marriage annulled by 1229, when Frederick married Agnes of Merania, a daughter of Otto I, Duke of Merania and Beatrice II, Countess of Burgundy.Annales Mellicenses 1229, MGH SS IX, Eudokia went on to marry Anseau de Cayeux, Chamberlain of the Latin Empire. Robert remained unmarried until about 1227. According to William of Tyre Continuator, Robert and the Lady of Neuville were secretly married, despite her already being the fianc√©e of a Burgundian gentleman. Both the new wife of the Emperor and her mother were placed in a manor house owned by Robert. The unnamed Burgundian gentleman somehow found out and reportedly organized a conspiracy against Robert and his new wife. The knights of Constantinople partaking in the conspiracy proceeded to capture the Empress and her mother. The lips and nostrils of both women were cut off and then thrown to sea.William of Tyre Continuator, Chapters 18-19 Robert left Constantinople following the attack, seeking the assistance of Pope Gregory IX in re-establishing his authority. On his return journey from Rome, Robert visited the court of Geoffrey I of Villehardouin of the Principality of Achaea. There he fell sick and died. He never returned to Constantinople. Their marriage was childless, whether the Lady survived her mutilation is uncertain. However she does not resurface in sources.

He studied at the University of Lund and came to know in particular Sigfrid Lindstrom and Gunnar Aspelin. In the summer he stayed in Lund to read Schopenhauer in the botanical garden of Lund at the foot of Aagardhs statue. He took the MBA in 1911 and his Ph.D in 1917 with the thesis Material problems of Platonism: Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Bruno: a historical-critical study. Later was a senior teacher at a college in Stockholm and was a lecturer at the Arbetarinstitutet. In 1927, he became a teacher at the workers educational institute, Brunnsvik, and in 1932 he became the headmaster, which he remained until his retirement in 1959. For several years he wrote frequently in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter. In 1933, he married Edith Larsson, who died in 1944. 1946 he remarried with MA Rut Davidsson. Ahlberg was mainly known for his scientific works on philosophy. One of the most noted works, ‚ÄùThe social and political myths‚Äù (1937), is about Nazi propaganda and mythology. In ‚ÄùEscape from loneliness‚Äù (1949) he investigated why the contemporary citizen is so susceptible to propaganda.

The club was one of the founding members of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League, finishing as runners-up in the opening two seasons of the competition. These remain their most successful seasons to date, having disappeared sometime after 2010.  History  Despite what their team logo suggests, Gelle Hills was founded in 2006 shortly before the inaugural Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season began. The club was one of five founding members, and they finished the regular season in third place in the league table. They progressed to the playoffs, where, on 18 November 2006, they were set to play Morobe FC in the semi-final. However, fading light stopped play at 0‚Äì0, and a replay was scheduled the following day. After surrendering a 3‚Äì0 lead, the match went to extra time, and the Hills pipped Morobe 6‚Äì5 to reach the very first Grand Final. Once there, they fell to Hekari United, losing 2‚Äì0, but picking up a prize of K25,000 for coming second. They returned for the 2007‚Äì08 season and once again performed well, finishing second in the regular season table, behind champions Hekari. After a 3‚Äì0 victory over Rapatona in the playoff semi-final, the team once again faced Hekari United in the Grand Final, and were the bridesmaids again, losing 3‚Äì2 despite a brace from Tau Winnie. In September 2008 it was reported that the club had been thrown out of the 2008‚Äì09 season as the side had failed to meet the statutory requirements necessary to maintain their status in the division. However, chairman Wilfred Vali had indicated that he had successfully negotiated the financial backing of Rob Jones, part-owner of Australian side Brisbane Roar FC, and that, as part of the agreement, Hills would secure the services of three Australian players for the forthcoming season. Nevertheless, Gelle Hills did not compete in the 2008‚Äì09 season. They would, however, return for the 2009‚Äì10 season as one of nine teams. Despite a promising start, with three wins from their opening four matches, the side were unable to make an impact upon their return, and finished 7th in the table. On 7 July 2010, Papua New Guinean newspaper The National suggested that Gelle Hills might be 'exempted' from the upcoming season's competition. Indeed, on 30 October 2010, the 2010‚Äì11 season kicked off with Gelle Hills not one of the seven teams taking part.

Emotions that can lead to crying include sadness, anger, and even happiness. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\", instead, giving a relief which protects from conjunctivitis. Quoted by Michelle C.P. Hendriks, A.J.J.M. Vingerhoets in Crying: is it beneficial for one's well- being? A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non- emotional shedding of tears. Various forms of crying are known as sobbing, weeping, wailing, whimpering, bawling, and blubbering. For crying to be described as sobbing, it usually has to be accompanied by a set of other symptoms, such as slow but erratic inhalation, occasional instances of breath holding and muscular tremor. A neuronal connection between the lacrimal gland (tear duct) and the areas of the human brain involved with emotion has been established. Scientists debate over whether humans are the only animals that produce tears in response to emotional states. Charles Darwin wrote in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals that the keepers of Indian elephants in the London Zoo told him that their charges shed tears in sorrow. Tears produced during emotional crying have a chemical composition which differs from other types of tears. They contain significantly greater quantities of the hormones prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and Leu- enkephalin, and the elements potassium and manganese. Function Two women weep at a funeral. The question of the function or origin of emotional tears remains open. Theories range from the simple, such as response to inflicted pain, to the more complex, including nonverbal communication in order to elicit altruistic helping behavior from others. Some have also claimed that crying can serve several biochemical purposes, such as relieving stress and clearance of the eyes. Crying is believed to be an outlet or a result of a burst of intense emotional sensations, such as agony, surprise or joy. This theory could explain why people cry during cheerful events, as well as very painful events.\\"Crying; The Mystery of Tears\\" personal page of Frey WH with quote from his book Individuals tend to remember the positive aspects of crying, and may create a link between other simultaneous positive events, such as resolving feelings of grief. Together, these features of memory reinforce the idea that crying helped the individual. In Hippocratic and medieval medicine, tears were associated with the bodily humors, and crying was seen as purgation of excess humors from the brain. William James thought of emotions as reflexes prior to rational thought, believing that the physiological response, as if to stress or irritation, is a precondition to cognitively becoming aware of emotions such as fear or anger. William H. Frey II, a biochemist at the University of Minnesota, proposed that people feel \\"better\\" after crying due to the elimination of hormones associated with stress, specifically adrenocorticotropic hormone. This, paired with increased mucosal secretion during crying, could lead to a theory that crying is a mechanism developed in humans to dispose of this stress hormone when levels grow too high. However, tears have a limited ability to eliminate chemicals, reducing the likelihood of this theory. Recent psychological theories of crying emphasize the relationship of crying to the experience of perceived helplessness. From this perspective, an underlying experience of helplessness can usually explain why people cry. For example, a person may cry after receiving surprisingly happy news, ostensibly because the person feels powerless or unable to influence what is happening. Emotional tears have also been put into an evolutionary context. One study proposes that crying, by blurring vision, can handicap aggressive or defensive actions, and may function as a reliable signal of appeasement, need, or attachment. Oren Hasson, an evolutionary psychologist in the zoology department at Tel Aviv University believes that crying shows vulnerability and submission to an attacker, solicits sympathy and aid from bystanders, and signals shared emotional attachments. Another theory that follows evolutionary psychology is given by Paul D. MacLean, who suggests that the vocal part of crying was used first as a \\"separation cry\\" to help reunite parents and offspring. The tears, he speculates, are a result of a link between the development of the cerebrum and the discovery of fire. MacLean figures that since early humans must have relied heavily on fire, their eyes were frequently producing reflexive tears in response to the smoke. As humans evolved the smoke possibly gained a strong association with the loss of life and, therefore, sorrow. In 2017 Carlo Bellieni analysed the weeping behavior, and concluded that most animals can cry but only humans have psychoemotional shedding of tears, also known as \\"weeping\\". Weeping is a behavior that induces empathy perhaps with the mediation of the mirror neurons network, and influences the mood through the release of hormones elicited by the massage effect made by the tears on the cheeks, or through the relief of the sobbing rhythm. Many ethologists would disagree. Biological response A child crying It can be very difficult to observe biological effects of crying, especially considering many psychologists believe the environment in which a person cries can alter the experience of the crier. However, crying studies in laboratories have shown several physical effects of crying, such as increased heart rate, sweating, and slowed breathing. Although it appears that the type of effects an individual experiences depends largely on the individual, for many it seems that the calming effects of crying, such as slowed breathing, outlast the negative effects, which could explain why people remember crying as being helpful and beneficial. =Globus sensation= The most common side effect of crying is feeling a lump in the throat of the crier, otherwise known as a globus sensation. Although many things can cause a globus sensation, the one experienced in crying is a response to the stress experienced by the sympathetic nervous system. When an animal is threatened by some form of danger, the sympathetic nervous system triggers several processes to allow the animal to fight or flee. This includes shutting down unnecessary body functions, such as digestion, and increasing blood flow and oxygen to necessary muscles. When an individual experiences emotions such as sorrow, the sympathetic nervous system still responds in this way. Another function increased by the sympathetic nervous system is breathing, which includes opening the throat in order to increase air flow. This is done by expanding the glottis, which allows more air to pass through. As an individual is undergoing this sympathetic response, eventually the parasympathetic nervous system attempts to undo the response by decreasing high stress activities and increasing recuperative processes, which includes running digestion. This involves swallowing, a process which requires closing the fully expanded glottis to prevent food from entering the larynx. The glottis, however, attempts to remain open as an individual cries. This fight to close the glottis creates a sensation that feels like a lump in the individual's throat. Other common side effects of crying are quivering lips, a runny nose, and an unsteady, cracking voice. Frequency of crying According to the German Society of Ophthalmology, which has collated different scientific studies on crying, the average woman cries between 30 and 64 times a year, and the average man cries between 6 and 17 times a year. Men tend to cry for between two and four minutes, and women cry for about six minutes. Crying turns into sobbing for women in 65% of cases, compared to just 6% for men. Until adolescence, however, no difference between the sexes was found. The gap between how often men and women cry is larger in wealthier, more democratic, and feminine countries. Types of crying in infants A newborn child crying. Although crying is an infant's mode of communication, it is not limited to a monotonous sound. There are three different types of cries apparent in infants. The first of these three is a basic cry, which is a systematic cry with a pattern of crying and silence. The basic cry starts with a cry coupled with a briefer silence, which is followed by a short high-pitched inspiratory whistle. Then, there is a brief silence followed by another cry. Hunger is a main stimulant of the basic cry. An anger cry is much like the basic cry; however, in this cry, more excess air is forced through the vocal cords, making it a louder, more abrupt cry. This type of cry is characterized by the same temporal sequence as the basic pattern but distinguished by differences in the length of the various phase components. The third cry is the pain cry, which, unlike the other two, has no preliminary moaning. The pain cry is one loud cry, followed by a period of breath holding. Most adults can determine whether an infant's cries signify anger or pain. Most parents also have a better ability to distinguish their own infant's cries than those of a different child. A 2009 study found that babies mimic their parents' pitch contour. French infants wail on a rising note while German infants favor a falling melody. Carlo Bellieni found a correlation between the features of babies' crying and the level of pain, though he found no direct correlation between the cause of crying and its characteristics. T. Berry Brazelton has suggested that overstimulation may be a contributing factor to infant crying and that periods of active crying might serve the purpose of discharging overstimulation and helping the baby's nervous system regain homeostasis. Brazelton, T.B. (1992). Touchpoints. New York: Perseus. Sheila Kitzinger found a correlation between the mother's prenatal stress level and later amount of crying by the infant. She also found a correlation between birth trauma and crying. Mothers who had experienced obstetrical interventions or who were made to feel powerless during birth had babies who cried more than other babies. Rather than try one remedy after another to stop this crying, she suggested that mothers hold their babies and allow the crying to run its course.Kitzinger, S. (1989). The Crying Baby. New York: Viking. Other studies have supported Kitzinger's findings. Babies who had experienced birth complications had longer crying spells at three months of age and awakened more frequently at night crying. Based on these various findings, Aletha Solter has proposed a general emotional release theory of infant crying. When infants cry for no obvious reason after all other causes (such as hunger or pain) are ruled out, she suggests that the crying may signify a beneficial stress-release mechanism. She recommends the \\"crying-in-arms\\" approach as a way to comfort these infants.Solter, A. (1995). \\"Why do babies cry?\\" Pre- and Perinatal Psychology Journal, 10 (1), 21‚Äì43.Solter, A. (1998). Tears and Tantrums: What to Do When Babies and Children Cry. Goleta, CA: Shining Star Press. Solter, A. (2004). Crying for comfort: distressed babies need to be held.\\" Mothering, Issue 122 January/February, 24‚Äì29. Another way of comforting and calming the baby is to mimic the familiarity and coziness of mother's womb. Dr. Robert Hamilton developed a technique to parents where a baby may be calmed and stop crying in 5 seconds. Categorizing dimensions A Frenchman sheds tears of patriotic grief (1940). There have been many attempts to differentiate between the two distinct types of crying: positive and negative. Different perspectives have been broken down into three dimensions to examine the emotions being felt and also to grasp the contrast between the two types. Spatial perspective explains sad crying as reaching out to be \\"there\\", such as at home or with a person who may have just died. In contrast, joyful crying is acknowledging being \\"here.\\" It emphasized the intense awareness of one's location, such as at a relative's wedding. Temporal perspective explains crying slightly differently. In temporal perspective, sorrowful crying is due to looking to the past with regret or to the future with dread. This illustrated crying as a result of losing someone and regretting not spending more time with them or being nervous about an upcoming event. Crying as a result of happiness would then be a response to a moment as if it is eternal; the person is frozen in a blissful, immortalized present. The last dimension is known as the public-private perspective. This describes the two types of crying as ways to imply details about the self as known privately or one's public identity. For example, crying due to a loss is a message to the outside world that pleads for help with coping with internal sufferings. Or, as Arthur Schopenhauer suggested, sorrowful crying is a method of self-pity or self- regard, a way one comforts oneself. Joyful crying, in contrast, is in recognition of beauty, glory, or wonderfulness. Religious views on crying Descent from the Cross, c. 1435 by Rogier van der Weyden, the tears of Mary of Clopas The Shia Ithna Ashari (Muslims who believe in twelve Imams after Muhammad) consider crying to be an important responsibility towards their leaders who were martyred. They believe a true lover of Imam Hussain can feel the afflictions and oppressions Imam Hussain suffered; his feelings are so immense that they break out into tears and wail. The pain of the beloved is the pain of the lover. Crying on Imam Husain is the sign or expression of true love. The Imams of Shias have encouraged crying especially on Imam Husaain and have informed about rewards for this act. They support their view through a tradition (saying) from Muhammad who said: (On the Day of Judgment, a group would be seen in the most excellent and honourable of states. They would be asked if they were of the Angels or of the Prophets. In reply they would state): \\"We are neither Angels nor Prophets but of the indigent ones from the ummah of Muhammad\\". They would then be asked: \\"How then did you achieve this lofty and honourable status?\\" They would reply: \\"We did not perform very many good deeds nor did we pass all the days in a state of fasting or all the nights in a state of worship but yes, we used to offer our (daily) prayers (regularly) and whenever we used to hear the mention of Muhammad, tears would roll down our cheeks\\".(Mustadrak al‚ÄëWasail, vol 10, pg. 318) In Orthodox and Catholic Christianity, tears are considered to be a sign of genuine repentance, and a desirable thing in many cases. Tears of true contrition are thought to be sacramental, helpful in forgiving sins, in that they recall the Baptism of the penitent. Type of tears A diagram showing the lacrimal apparatus There are three types of tears: basal tears, reflexive tears, and psychic tears. Basal tears are produced at a rate of about 1 to 2 microliters a minute, and are made in order to keep the eye lubricated and smooth out irregularities in the cornea. Reflexive tears are tears that are made in response to irritants to the eye, such as when chopping onions or getting poked in the eye. Psychic tears are produced by the lacrimal system and are the tears expelled during emotional states. Disorders related to crying * Baby colic, where an infant's excessive crying has no obvious cause or underlying medical disorder. * Bell's palsy, where faulty regeneration of the facial nerve can cause sufferers to shed tears while eating. * Cri du chat, where the characteristic cry of affected infants, which is similar to that of a meowing kitten, is due to problems with the larynx and nervous system. * Familial dysautonomia, where there can be a lack of overflow tears (alacrima), during emotional crying. * Pathological laughing and crying, where the patients experience uncontrollable episodes of laughing, crying, or in some cases both. * Dyslacrymia, where there is a lack of crying and emotional processing.

More specifically, W.D. examines sexual assault cases and burdens of proof in evidence law. Background DW, a 42-year-old man, was charged with sexually assaulting a 16-year-old girl, TW, on two occasions while driving her to her boyfriend's house. TW was staying at DW's house at the time. Besides her claim of the event, there was little circumstantial evidence. Her panties had semen stains from a Type A secretor, which included DW, but also 32% of the population. The secretor type of the boyfriend was never known. At trial before a judge and jury the defence argued that she was not credible. She was unemployed, illiterate, and a dropout, and had been kicked out of several houses including Dw's house. The testimony of DW was poor, but it is uncertain whether it was due to lack of intelligence or deception. At the end of the trial the judge issued its charge to the jury without mention of any issue of credibility. Less than ten minutes later the Crown made a request for a recharge to bring this issue up. Counsel for the Crown requested the recharge in order for the judge to explain what evidence may assist the jury in making a finding on the issue of credibility. During the recharge, the judge charged to the jury that: :If in fact you believe the accused then clearly nothing took place and in fact the Crown will have failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he is guilty as charged. On the other hand if you in fact believe the complainant totally, then he is guilty as charged. On these instructions the jury returned a guilty verdict. The issue of the appeal was whether \\"the erroneous recharge, viewed in the context of the charge as a whole and the short time that elapsed between the main charge and the recharge, could be said to have left the jury with any doubt that if they had a reasonable doubt they must acquit.\\" The judge erred in the short recharge in that he characterized the core issue to be determined by the jury as to whether they believed the complainant or whether they believed the appellant. The counsel for the appellant objected to the recharge, but the trial judge's response was that he did not feel that he left the jury with the impression that they must accept the appellant's evidence in order to acquit him. Thus, the appeal to the Court of Appeal was initially dismissed. Reasons for judgment Justice Cory, for the majority, denied the appeal. In considering the recharge, he found that the judge erred. :It is incorrect to instruct a jury in a criminal case that, in order to render a verdict, they must decide whether they believe the defence evidence or the Crown's evidence. Putting this either/or proposition to the jury excludes the third alternative; namely, that the jury, without believing the accused, after considering the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole, may still have a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Cory describes the correct method of assessing credibility as follows at p. 310: : Ideally, appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility should be given, not only during the main charge, but on any recharge. A trial judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along these lines: ::First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must acquit. ::Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit. (Note: this is a more contentious point) ::Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of the guilt of the accused. Nevertheless, on examining the circumstances of the error as a whole, Cory believed that the jury had been properly instructed and the error was not sufficient to bring about an acquittal. Comments Based on Cory's second point, \\"If you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit\\" (a more contentious point), the jury is essentially told to choose between two conflicting stories. Certainly, if the jury rejected all of the evidence of the accused, it is difficult to see how that very evidence, having been rejected, could raise a reasonable doubt. However, if a jury could reject part of the evidence of the accused and still reasonably entertain a doubt as to his guilt based on other parts of the accused's evidence. In a similar case, R v. S (WD) [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, it was reiterated that it is erroneous to direct a jury that they must accept the Crown's evidence or that of the defence. Again, to put forth such an either/or approach excludes the very real and legitimate possibility that the jury may not be able to select one version in preference to the other, and yet, on a whole of the evidence, be left with a reasonable doubt. The effect of putting such a position to the jury is to shift the burden to the accused of demonstrating his presumption of innocence, since the jury might believe that the accused could not be acquitted unless the defence evidence was believed. It is evident that the trial judge erred in the case of W.D., making error in recharge as to the standard of proof required of the Crown. The Court examined whether the error was reversible in light of the correct instructions that had been given to the jury minutes prior to the recharge during the main charge. In other words, the trial judge's error of putting such an either/or proposition to the jury causes the exclusion of a third alternative: that the jury, without believing the accused, after considering the accused's evidence in the context of the evidence as a whole, may still have reasonable doubt as to his guilt. Where an error has been made in the instruction of jury members on the burden of proof in a criminal case, the fact that the trial judge correctly instructed the jury on that issue elsewhere in the charge is a strong indication that the jury were not in fact left in doubt as to the burden resting on the Crown. As Sopinka J. dissented, credibility is a fundamental issue. When dealing with the burden of proof, the trial judge is dealing with the most fundamental rule of the legal game. It is especially important that it be very clear and unequivocal that the prosecution has not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt if, after considering the evidence of the accused and the complainant together with any other evidence, there is a doubt. The charge absolutely did not make this clear to the jury. Sopinka noted that the jury were told two things which were in conflict. First, the main charge, in dealing with the credibility of the accused, the Crown could fail to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt even if the jury had a doubt about the credibility of the accused's story. Then, on the recharge, the Crown would have failed to discharge its onus only if they believed the evidence of the accused. The jury would be uncertain as to which version was correct and it's pure speculation that they would have accepted the first version rather than the second one, which was characterized by the trial judge as \\"better\\". This takes on additional significance in light of the statement to the jury that the charge might contain errors that would necessitate a recharge.

The club was one of the founding members of the Papua New Guinea National Soccer League in 2006, alongside Hekari United, Morobe FC, Gelle Hills and Welgris Highlanders, and are the only founding member still participating in the division, due to clubs folding or defecting to the rival Papua New Guinea National Premier League. Their most successful spell has come in recent years, since the NSL‚ÄìNPL split, with the side having qualified for two consecutive OFC Champions League seasons, in 2017. and 2018. Since 2019, they merged with Tusbab Stallions.  History  = Foundation and early years = The club was founded sometime before the kick-off of the 2006 National Soccer League season. They entered the inaugural competition and finished 4th out of five clubs in the regular season, qualifying for the playoffs as a result. The club were inches from making the Grand Final, holding eventual champions PRK Souths United 2‚Äì2 after extra time, but fell 4‚Äì2 on penalties, before being beaten 4‚Äì0 by TL Blue Kumuls in the third-place playoff. For the 2007‚Äì08 season, the side returned alongside six other teams, but their drop-off in form continued into the new season, winning just one match from twelve, conceding 50 goals, and finishing bottom of the league. The side decided not to return for the 2008‚Äì09 season. Ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season, Welgris Fuel Distributors ‚Äì under its sponsorship brand Niupetro Fuel ‚Äì withdrew their sponsorship of Welgris Highlanders and moved their focus to Madang, allowing Madang FC to re-enter the league under the name of Madang Niupetro Fox. Madang lined up against nine other sides, but fared no better than their last season, finishing in 8th place and again failing to qualify for the playoffs. Following some confusion as to whether both Madang FC and Besta Madang were eligible to enter the 2010‚Äì11 season, Madang FC were eventually accepted and competed again, but again finished second-bottom in what would be their last season for three years. = NSL absence and hiatus = In July 2011, it was reported that the side had failed to register their interest for the upcoming 2011‚Äì12 season. In August, it was confirmed that the side were not part of the selected teams heading into the new season. In February 2013, Papua New Guinean newspaper The National reported that the club was now defunct. = Return to NSL and OFC qualification = On 30 July 2014, it was confirmed that the club would be returning to National Soccer League action after a three-season absence. The side finished 4th in the regular season table, reaching the playoffs. The club were drawn against eight-time champions Hekari United in the second semi-final, whom they had lost to 8‚Äì1 during the regular season, but the club entered the history books by denying Hekari a ninth straight title, winning 3‚Äì2 thanks in part to a brace from Vanya Malagian. Malagian scored again in the Grand Final against Lae FC, but it was merely a consolation, as their opponents won 5‚Äì1 to pick up their first title. Madang FC were one of twelve clubs entered ahead of the 2015‚Äì16 season, which was the first season to be split into conferences. Madang were placed in the Northern Conference, alongside champions Lae City Dwellers and fellow founding members Morobe FC, and finished the regular season behind the two clubs, missing out on the playoffs by two points, despite a 2‚Äì1 final-round victory against Lae City. Due to Hekari United's defection from the Papua New Guinea Football Association and the National Soccer League, and their subsequent ban from Oceania Football Confederation competitions, the OFC offered participation to the next best teams in the 2015‚Äì16 competition. With Lae City Dwellers already qualified, and Morobe FC and Rapatona FC both rejecting the offer, Madang took Hekari's spot and, as such, entered their first ever OFC Champions League in 2017. Despite picking up their maiden continental victory against Lupe in a 4‚Äì3 thriller in New Caledonia, the side finished third in Group A behind hosts AS Magenta and Tahitian side AS Central Sport and filled to qualify for the knockout stages. Thanks to the league split, and Madang and Lae's participation in the Champions League, the 2017 National Soccer League was delayed until May 2017. In the opening game of the six-team season, both OFC clubs played each other with the sides fighting out a 1‚Äì1 draw. Six wins, a draw and three defeats saw Madang finish second in the regular season, once again securing qualification for the 2018 OFC Champions League, as well as qualifying for the domestic playoffs. The side were due to play PS Huawei in the second semi-final, but their opponents withdrew after the match was postponed due to a late venue change, citing poor management of the competition. The NSL board proceeded to cancel the Grand Final, blaming 'the rainy season in Lae, the national elections and the failure of some clubs to pay their fees in full'. The 2018 season was also turbulent, with only five out of seven sides completing all their fixtures. The season started in January 2018, and Madang made a decent start, winning their first two matches before being thrashed 7‚Äì2 by reigning champions Toti City Dwellers. Meanwhile, the club were struggling to raise finances for their second continental trip, having sent only half the side to Auckland, New Zealand by 15 February, ahead of matches set to begin ten days later. They appealed to help from the public to raise the required c.K100,000 to fund the rest of the side to get to the tournament. By their first group game against Lautoka on 25 February, the squad only had 12 players at their disposal. Although they were boosted by the arrival of additional players before their clash against title-holders Auckland City on 28 February, they lost 5‚Äì0. They also lost their third match against AS V√©nus and finished bottom of Group C. Domestically, the side finished 4th in the regular season table, missing out on a third straight continental campaign, before losing 5‚Äì4 on penalties to eventual champions Toti City Dwellers in the playoff semi-finals. Conrad Wadunah, executive member of the club's association, blamed poor refereeing for the defeat, after the side led 2‚Äì1 with two minutes of extra time remaining, before the officials awarded a penalty to Toti, which was duly converted. In the third- place playoff, the side went down to newcomers Morobe Wawens FC, 2‚Äì0. = Withdrawal from NSL = Ahead of the 2019 season, Madang Soccer Association president Siegfried Beschel revealed that the Madang Provincial Government had withdrawn their sponsorship of the side after four years. This led to the side being forced to withdraw from the National Soccer League.

The company focuses mainly on wholesale to third party retailers but also operates a factory outlet in Vancouver and an online store. Founded in 1998, HTnaturals has grown from a fledgling home-based business to a thriving leader in the natural and organic clothing industry. History Jason Finnis and Larisa Harrison, founders of HTnaturals, began working in the hemp industry after meeting at the University of Victoria in 1994. They started by selling hempen goods such as paper and clothing at folk festivals and other events. Later deciding to concentrate purely on apparel, they opened Hemptown Clothing Inc. in 1998 after the production of industrial hemp was re-legalized in Canada ‚Äì a legislative measure which Mr. Finnis had been publicly supporting throughout his career. In 2006, the company changed its brand name to HTnaturals to reflect the incorporation of other natural materials, such as bamboo and soy, into its products. In 2007, HTnaturals provided all of the garments for Starbucks' \\"My Starbucks\\" T-shirt program.Corporate Timeline HTnaturals closed their doors in the summer of 2009. This allowed them to focus all of their attention on the hemp fibre technology that they're working towards. It became clear early on that the quality of eco apparel, specifically hemp apparel, needed to be improved before consumers, farmers, and politicians could be enticed to promote the growing of hemp in North America. In 2004 they partnered with the National Research Council of Canada and the Alberta Research Council to develop new processes for transforming Canadian-grown hemp into a soft cotton-like alternative called CRAILAR. They were successful in reaching this goal and have spun fibres on regular cotton- spinning equipment, resulting in cloth with applications ranging from T-shirts to carpet. They are now in the midst of commercializing this technology and exploring partnerships with some of the world's leading brands. They have recently signed a multi-phase Joint Development Agreement with Hanes (www.hanes.com). Products HTnaturals produced clothing and accessories made from hemp, soy, organic cotton and bamboo.

It serves as the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Edmonton, currently Jane Alexander. History The Anglican Parish of All Saints was founded in 1875 by William Newton, the first known Anglican missionary to the Edmonton area. He arrived in Edmonton on September 28, 1875, having left Ontario in the spring. The parish first met in a log cabin at the corner of what is now Jasper Avenue and 121st Street.All Saint's Anglican Cathedral 1875‚Äì1975, Jean A. Monckton By 1895 the parish had grown considerably and required a new building. A church was constructed on 103rd Street near the present site; however construction was only half completed due to lack of funds. In 1905 the church went through considerable renovations completing the original building plans. In 1914 the newly installed Bishop of Edmonton, H. A. Gray, named All Saints as the pro- cathedral of the diocese. On December 20, 1919, a fire broke out and destroyed the church leaving only the outside walls intact. The pro-cathedral was rebuilt on the same site. The present building was completed in 1956 and was given the permanent status of cathedral. The building, dedicated on May 10, 1956. The synod offices of the diocese and those of the cathedral are located on the second floor, and seniors' residence cathedral close adjoins the cathedral via an atrium. The parish hall to the north, which predated the current cathedral, was demolished in 1973. Clergy The cathedral serves as the seat of the Bishop of Edmonton, currently Jane Alexander, who was installed on May 11, 2008, the Feast of Pentecost. She had previously served as the dean and rector of All Saints until her consecration as bishop. The present Dean is the Very Reverend Alex Meek, who was installed on 1 March 2020. The post of vicar is currently vacant. All Saints has three honorary assistant priests. As well, several retired clergy attend All Saints on a regular basis and do not have honorary assistant status. The lay (non-clergy) staff is rounded out with a director of music, and an executive assistant to the dean. All Saints is host to a congregation of immigrants from South Sudan under the Rev. Akon Lual Akon and his assistant priest, the Rev. John Ayuen.

Guillory has been called \\"'the Mayor' of prep basketball in Southern California\\" due to his success at promoting basketball tournaments. Guillory's involvement with college basketball players, particularly O. J. Mayo, has been the subject of media and NCAA scrutiny. Biography Guillory played basketball at Centennial High School in Compton, California. Basketball promotion Guillory's relationship with Fresno State's Tito Maddox and USC's Jeff Trepagnier led to suspensions for both players after the NCAA determined Guillory had been working as a runner for an agent. Maddox and Trepagnier missed nearly one-third of the 2000-01 season after the NCAA determined that Guillory had purchased airfare for the players, a violation because Guillory was representing a sports agency. =O. J. Mayo= Guillory has had a \\"close relationship\\" with Mayo since seventh grade--Mayo has referred to him as a mentor. Mayo and Guillory met at the ABCD summer basketball camp in Teaneck, New Jersey. Guillory played an important role in recruiting Mayo to play college basketball at USC. USC coach Tim Floyd hadn't recruited Mayo until Guillory \\"walked into Floyd's office\\" and said Mayo wanted to attend USC; Mayo's interest was based on Los Angeles's position as a major media market, host of an NBA franchise (Los Angeles Lakers), and USC's lack of an \\"established tradition\\" in basketball. Floyd, aware of Guillory's role in the NCAA sanctions on Maddox and Trepagnier asked USC athletic department investigators to look for \\"irregularities in Guillory‚Äôs relationship with Mayo\\". None were found, according to Floyd. A 2008 report from ESPN's Outside the Lines alleged that, while at USC, Mayo received thousands of dollars in cash and gifts from Louis Johnson and Rodney Guillory, who were allegedly acting as \\"runners\\" for Bill Duffy Associates Sports Management (BDA Sports). The report alleges that Guillory received about $200,000 from BDA Sports; in exchange, Mayo would sign with BDA Sports when he turned professional. Mayo signed with agent Calvin Andrews of BDA Sports prior to the 2008 NBA Draft. Mayo originally signed with Duffy, but he switched agents after those allegations were made public.

His name is derived from the date on a tradesman's register, the Matricola dei merciai, now in the Civic Museum in Bologna; his hand may also be discerned in a set of choir books which were painted for the Dominican convent in that city; this group of works is earlier, and can be dated to the first half of the 1320s, as can a copy of Gratian's Decretals now in Madrid. At the same time the Master participated in the creation of the Rhetorica ad Erennium now held at Holkham Hall in Norfolk. Stylistically, while he bears the influence of his local contemporaries, he was evidently also aware of the later paintings of Giotto; he was also the first to apply Giotto's new rules of painting to Bolognese manuscript illumination in anything approaching a regular pattern.

Life and career Schmitt-Walter was born in Germersheim. He studied in Nuremberg with Gustav Landauer, and made his debut there in 1921. He subsequently appeared at provincial opera houses in Oberhausen, Saarbr√ºcken, Dortmund and Wiesbaden, building a reputation for vocal excellence as he went along. Schmitt-Walter made his key debut at the Berlin State Opera in 1935, as Luna in Il trovatore, which led to a long association with this important theatre, where he would sing wide repertory of lyric parts for the baritone voice. He also performed often at the Hamburg State Opera, the Vienna State Opera, the Salzburg Festival, the Bayreuth Festival, and, from 1950, the Munich State Opera. Outside the Austro-German operatic heartland, he made guest appearances at the Paris Op√©ra, the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London, the Liceo in Barcelona, La Monnaie in Brussels and the Holland Festival, among other major European venues. Schmitt- Walter possessed a comparatively light, high-baritone voice of great beauty and was equipped with an exceptionally good singing technique. He was particularly admired in Mozart and Wagner roles, notably Papageno, Wolfram von Eschenbach, and Beckmesser, which role he often sang at Bayreuth. Schmitt- Walter also performed in Verdi operas such as Ernani, La traviata and Un ballo in maschera, mostly in German translation. He enjoyed considerable success in light German operas by Lortzing and also in operetta. He was an excellent lieder interpreter, too. From 1962, he taught in Munich and Copenhagen and died in Bavaria at the age of 84.

Between the late 1960s and the early 1980s, Rosenberger was a member of the piano faculties of the University of Southern California, Immaculate Heart College, and California State University, Northridge. At USC she taught a workshop for instrumentalists and vocalists entitled \\"Preparation for Performance,\\" which drew upon the techniques she had developed to rehabilitate her own playing from the after-effects of paralytic polio. On her concert tours throughout the U.S., she often included piano workshops while performing at universities. After making a number of recordings for Delos, Rosenberger became interested in classical recording production, and began co-producing recordings with Delos founder Amelia Haygood. The Delos Recordings for Young People seriesDelos Music for Young People Series was a result of this partnership. Since the death of Delos founder Amelia Haygood in 2007, Rosenberger has taken on a larger responsibility for the label, and is now its director. Concert history Rosenberger's debut tour in 1970 received enthusiastic reviews from cities like New York City, Boston, London, Paris, Vienna, Berlin and other capitals. Rosenberger's recital programs and guest appearances with orchestras have carried her to most major European and American cities. She has been guest soloist with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, English Chamber Orchestra, Scottish Chamber Orchestra, Orchestre Philharmonique de Monte Carlo, Moscow Chamber Orchestra, New York Chamber Symphony, National Symphony, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Houston Symphony, Detroit Symphony Orchestra, Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra; performing with conductors Gerard Schwarz, James DePreist, Constantine Orbelian, Neville Marriner, Rafael Fr√ºhbeck de Burgos, Izler Solomon, among others Recording history Over 30 recordings on the Delos label encompassed a wide range of piano repertoire. Her recording of Howard Hanson‚Äôs Fantasy Variations on a Theme of Youth, with Gerard Schwarz and the New York Chamber SymphonyHoward Hanson‚Äôs Fantasy Variations on a Theme of Youth, with Gerard Schwarz and the New York Chamber Symphony brought her a 1991 Grammy Nomination for Best Performance, Soloist with Orchestra. Rosenberger and Schwarz followed this recording with the rarely heard Hanson Piano Concerto with the Seattle Symphony. Together with Constantine Orbelian and the Moscow Chamber Orchestra, Rosenberger has recorded the premiere of Frank Bridge‚Äôs Chamber Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra (arr. C. Orbelian),Frank Bridge‚Äôs Chamber Concerto for Piano and String Orchestra (arr. C. Orbelian) an arrangement of the Quintet (1912). Rosenberger‚Äôs celebrated series of concept-recordings began with Water Music of the Impressionists,Water Music of the Impressionists which was selected by Stereo Review as one of the 25 Best Classical Compact Discs of all time, by Gramophone as a Recording of the Year, and by Billboard as an All-time Great Recording. The Impressionistic Night Moods The Impressionistic Night Moods was the successful sequel, and a second water- music disc, Singing on the Water,Singing on the Water included Barcarolles written especially for the album by Sir Richard Rodney Bennett and American composer David Diamond. Together with label founder and co-producer Amelia Haygood, Rosenberger led the way into another area of concept recordings with the 1989 release of her Perchance to Dream, Lullabys for Children and Adults,Perchance to Dream, Lullabys for Children and Adults which was one of the first classical CDs designed primarily for young people. Together with Amelia, Rosenberger co-produced the Music for Young People Series. As producer of special recording projects combining music and narration, Rosenberger has worked with such narrators as James Earl Jones, Michael York and Natalia Makarova.

He batted and threw left-handed. He is now a coach for the South Korea national baseball team. Career =Amateur career= Attending Gunsan Commerce High School in Gunsan, Jeollabuk-do, Lee was considered the best high school hitter. He was also a highly regarded left-handed power pitcher who threw in the mid-90s as a starter. In 1997, he was selected for the South Korea national junior team that finished in 5th place at the 1997 World Junior Baseball Championship held in Moncton, New Brunswick, Canada. = Professional career = SK Wyverns Upon graduation from Gunsan High School, Lee was drafted by the Ssangbangwool Raiders, which became the SK Wyverns after the 1999 season, in the first round of the 1999 KBO Draft.

The club was founded as a new franchise ahead of the 2007‚Äì08 Papua New Guinea National Soccer League season, consisting predominantly from the local-level areas of the Madang province. The club finished 6th out of 7 sides that season, and failed to return the following season.  History  The club was founded shortly before the 2007‚Äì08 National Soccer League, and was the second Madang-based franchise to enter the competition after Madang FC's debut the previous season. The franchise was created to allow players from local-level government areas of the Madang province to get a taste of semi-professional football. The team entered the second as one of two debuting teams, with the second being Rapatona FC, who had competed for years in the Port Moresby Premier League. Rapatona's experience was no match for the newcomers in the opening match of the season, and the Fighters went down 3‚Äì0. In their second game, they managed to hold champions Hekari United to a thrilling 4‚Äì4 draw. However, they would not win a league game until the fifth round of fixtures, when they defeated fellow Madang side Madang FC 3‚Äì2 thanks to a hat-trick from Niel Hans. The side then endured a run of four consecutive defeats, including a 6‚Äì0 thrashing in the return fixture against Hekari, but would win their second game against title-chasing Morobe FC on 16 February 2008, unexpectedly winning 4‚Äì0 to shake up the title race. They would win twice more, completing the double over Madang FC with a 6‚Äì5 win later in February, before a 3‚Äì1 victory over Welgris Highlanders on the final day of the season. The side finished 6th in the table. In October 2008, it was reported that both Madang-based teams had been kicked out of the National Soccer League, with 'poor performance and lack of support, financial and otherwise' being the reasons cited. This would be the first and last time the side were seen in competitive action.

It is a medium-sized broad-leaved deciduous tree. Common names include Assyrian plum', lasura, pidar, panugeri, naruvilli, geduri, spistan, burgund dulu wanan and '. It is found growing primarily in Asia, as well as, across the globe especially in tropical regions having the right type of geophysical environment. It is seen coming up naturally and growing abundantly from Myanmar in the east to Lebanon and Syria in the west. Its habitat starts at about 200 m above mean sea level in the plains and ascends to an altitude around 1,500 m in the hills. Habit Lasura matures in about 50 to 60 years by when its girth at the breast height is about 1 to 1.5 m. Its bole (main trunk) is generally straight and cylindrical, attaining a height of nearly 3 to 4 m. The branches spread in all directions by virtue of which its crown can be trained into a beautiful inverted dome like an umbrella. When fully grown up, the total height of the tree comes to nearly 10 to 15 m. In less favorable climate and or unfavorable environment, however, it has a lesser growth and may attain a somewhat crooked form. In still worse environments it can even remain a stunted shrub. Bark The bark of lasura is grayish brown in color with longitudinal and vertical fissures. The tree can be easily identified from a distance by observing the fissures which are so prominent in the bark of the main bole of a tree approaching maturity. Leaves The leaves of lasura are broad, ovate, alternate and stalked with the spread being 7 to 15 cm x 5 to 10 cm. In matter of external appearance these are glabrous above and pubescent below. The young leaves tend to be hairy. The fresh foliage is quite useful as fodder for cattle ‚Äî more so during grass famines. These are also used for wrapping biddies and cheroots. Flowers Lasura tree flowers during March‚ÄìApril. The inflorescence, mostly terminal, is, white in color. Individual florets are nearly 5 mm in diameter. At places these are somewhat hairy and white. Being a deciduous plant, the species bears male and female flowers on the same tree. The calyx part of an independent flower is about 8 mm long and glabrous, but not pubescent. It splits irregularly at the opening of its bud into flower. The filaments are hairy. Fruit The fruit of lasura start appearing during July‚ÄìAugust. It is a kind of a drupe, light pale to brown or even pink in color. The appearance tends to darken when ripening sets in. Being full of viscid glue like mucilage, the pulp is somewhat translucent. When fully ripe the pulp becomes quite sweet in taste and is fully enjoyed by children. The pulp in a half ripe fruit can even be used as an alternative to paper glue in office work. Cultivation Keeping in view the numerous utilities of the plant it is widely cultivated in the arid zone too. The species is indigenous to China and is widely cultivated in lower plains and tropical regions. Though this plant flourishes well in deep clayey loam and sandy soils, it does still better in areas experiencing nearly 100 to 150 cm of annual rainfall.Oudhia, P., 2007. Cordia myxa L.

Ruthin RFC presently play in the Welsh Rugby Union Division One North League and is a hub club for RGC, the North Wales Regional team. Club history A rugby club was first formed in Ruthin in the 1920s, but that early club folded in 1933 and was not reformed until the 1960s. Since then, Ruthin has been one of the premier clubs in North Wales and has produced a number of players for North Wales and other representative teams. The list of honours below highlight that the club had successful side in the 1970s and many from that Ruthin team are still actively involved in the club. Ruthin returned to Division 4 North in the 2006-7 season after 2 years in Division 3 South East. The club were not relegated, but elected to return to the North Wales league in advance of a decision by the WRU that they would not have been able to play in the South Wales leagues in 2007. Ruthin had gained promotion to Division 3 in 2004 after winning the league in North Wales and the 2005-06 North Wales Cup under two of the most successful coaches Ruthin have had in Paul Threlfall and Russell Penrhyn Jones, both former players. They guided the club to their first North Wales league win for almost 30 years, this highlighted the club's leading position in North Wales. Having lost over 15 players due to injury, retirement and transfers at the end of the 2005-06 season, 2006-07 was one of rebuilding and a number of promising young players have emerged to take the club forward in the next few years. Winning the North Wales Cup again in 2007-08 was a notable achievement for Ruthin's young side.Ruthin beat Colwyn Bay in cup final dailypost.co.uk May 27, 2008 For the 2009/2010 season Rhuthun returned to wearing the original Blue and White hoop kit for the club 10th anniversary after returning in 1999,the current away kit is a pink and white hoop kit. Winning the North Wales Cup for the 7th time in 2013-14 was a great achievement for the strong but young Ruthin side beating Pwllheli in a nail- biting win at Parc Eirias, Colwyn Bay which is the heart of North Wales rugby. The thriving mini and Junior sections are critical to the continued success of the club and nearly 300 players between U7 and U16 are registered with the club. The pathway to senior rugby is underpinned by the youth and 2nd teams which are also amongst the best in North Wales. Former players of note In 1992, James Salisbury became the first Ruthin produced player to earn a Welsh Youth Cap and after playing for Liverpool St Helens and Widnes RL. Two other members include Eifion Lewis-Roberts and Rob Higgitt who are recent first team players and products of Ruthins youth system. Lewis-Roberts played for Sale Sharks for over 10 years and played for spell in the Top 14 for Toulon. Higgitt played for the Scarlets and played for Bristol for several years. Lewis-Roberts is the first former Ruthin player to have donned a Wales senior team shirt when he made his debut appearance against Canada in November 2008.

Stobo was an officer in the Virginia militia who, during the French and Indian War, acted as a spy while a prisoner-of-war at Fort Duquesne. He was later convicted as a spy in Quebec and, while a prisoner there, was able to gain invaluable knowledge of the local area which was later used by British forces during the capture of Quebec. Biography The only son of merchant William Stobo, Robert Stobo was born in Glasgow, Scotland and sent off to the Colony of Virginia when his parents died. In the care of Glasgow merchants, he worked in their store for much of his early childhood. When he came of age, he sold the property left to him by his parents and used the money to open his own business in Virginia although the venture ultimately proved unsuccessful. A favorite of colonial Lieutenant-Governor Robert Dinwiddie, he was appointed a captain in the Virginia militia shortly before the French and Indian War. In order to ensure the compliance of the surrender terms agreed to by Major George Washington following the Battle of the Great Meadows, he and Captain Jacob Van Braam were left as prisoners-of-war on July 28, 1754 in the care of Captain Coulon de Villiers at Fort Duquesne until at such time they could be released in a prisoner exchange. During his captivity, he was an open prisoner and spent his time making detailed sketches of the fort and plans for its destruction. In a letter containing these plans he wrote, \\"For my part I would die ten thousand deaths to have the pleasure of possessing this fort...\\" His plans concluded that one hundred Indians could take the fort. He was able to get these sketches to British forces, however these papers were recovered by the French after the Battle of the Monongahela and he was sent to Quebec where he was tried and convicted as a spy. Stobo was sentenced to death, although his sentence was commuted to closed confinement. He managed to escape from prison and, arriving on a ship from Halifax, he rejoined British forces at Louisburgh on the island of Cape Breton shortly after General James Wolfe had departed for Quebec. Following after him, Stobo was able to catch up to Wolfe and provide him with knowledge of the area including the landing site chosen for Wolfe's forces during the capture of Quebec.Craig, Neville B.

XV/25 was written in 1795, during the final few weeks of Haydn's second trip to London.Brauner, J√ºrgen: Studien zu den Klaviertios von Joseph Haydn.In: W√ºrzburg. 1995 It is perhaps his best-known piano trio and sometimes nicknamed the \\"Gypsy\\" or \\"Gypsy Rondo\\" trio because of its Rondo finale in 'Hungarian' style.. The trio is in three movements: 1\\\\. Andante. Rosemary Hughes describes this movement as \\"a curious but charming blend of double-variation and rondo, for the two minor sections are extremely free in their connexion either with the major main theme or with each other.'Joseph Haydn', in Chamber Music, ed.

The cellist Pablo Casals was so taken with the melody in the central section (accompanied by rippling triplets from the piano) that he would take over from the violin during the repeat. 3\\\\.

This mockumentary featured various alien ecosystem projects from the Epona Project to Ringworld. It also featured many notable scientists and science fiction authors such as Dr. Jack Cohen, Derek Briggs, Christopher McKay, David Wynn-Williams, Emily Holton, Peter Cattermole, Brian Aldiss, Sil Read, Wolf Read, Edward K. Smallwood, Adega Zuidema, Steve Hanly, Kevin Warwick and Dougal Dixon. Plot The viewer is in an intergalactic spaceship named the S.S. Attenborough, run by a small green alien. =Cambrian Earth= Earth during the Cambrian. =Mars= =Asteroids= The documentary visits asteroids and talks about the possibility of panspermia seeding solar system with life. =Europa= Featured organisms * Europa Cone Bacteria: Orange-gray bacteria that grow in huge towers that rise many miles above the ocean floor. Inside these vents, warm water rises, nourishing layer upon layer of bacteria. * Europa Sea Vent Herbivore: A giant, gray, shark-like swimmer that feeds on bacteria in schools with a suction cup-like mouth on an extended, Opabinia-like trunk. These trunk-shaped mouths pierce the vents to suck in vast quantities of bacteria. These grazers are territorial and, like squid on Earth, flash warning glows to drive away rivals. They make a series of dolphin-like cries. * Europa Sea Vent Carnivore: A predatory, yellow-green, echolocating, streamlined, shark-like swimmer that is built for speed and preys on the Europa Sea Vent Herbivores. Like the Europa Sea Vent Herbivores, the Europa Sea Vent Carnivores also have an Opabinia-like snout, which they use to kill their prey. =High Gravity Planet= The next world visited is a high gravity planet home to many insect-like aliens who have adapted to 1.5 times Earth's gravity. High gravity means a thicker atmosphere (the planet in question having an atmosphere 15 times as dense as Earth's) and therefore easier flight. Featured organisms * Pteropede: A gray-green, millipede-like creature from High Gravity Planet with accordion-folding, dragon-like wings. It resembles a dragonfly when it flies. It may be able to take advantage over of the denser air to fly, but high gravity can lead to a bumpy landing. To support its great weight, the creature's eight legs are directly under its body. It breathes through lungs in the tip of its tail, which is more efficient than the way insects take in air, so the Pteropede is able to pump oxygen through its large, heavy body. To grow, the Pteropede must enter the water. It is only in the buoyancy of water, where gravity has little effect, that the Pteropede can shed its skin and increase in size. Once the new skin is hardened, the Pteropede can return to the demanding heavy gravity environment on land. * Sputnik Bug: A small, blue, Eoarthropleura-like creature from High Gravity Planet named after Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite in orbit. It has spines to protect it from a dangerous fall. Whenever it does fall, it immediately rolls up in a ball when it starts to tumble. * Splatter Bug: A small, brown, eurypterid-like creature from High Gravity Planet. It sadly has nothing to protect its soft body. It's an evolutionary dead-end. =Helliconia= The documentary visits the science fiction world of Helliconia, which was created by Brian Aldiss. It's a binary system and they show how life can adapt to having two suns. Featured organism * Helliconian Tree, a strange-looking tree from Helliconia with a cooling tower-shaped trunk with branches on the very top that sprout narrow leaves, making the branch look like a moth antenna during the short summers. Like deciduous trees on Earth, the Helliconian Tree turns dormant during snow- filled winters. It sheds its leaves but its branches curl up and go inside the Tree. The Tree then shields its top with an ice-like cap it grows. =Sulfuria= The documentary visits the science fiction world of Sulfuria, which was created by Dougal Dixon. It's a sulfur rich world that is similar to Io. Featured organisms * Sulfurian Balloon Plant: A tall, orange organism from Sulfuria that lives off of sunlight. They are like giant balloons, anchored to the ground and buoyed up by the gas inside of their flattish, pizza-like tops. They are like kelp on Earth. Babies sprout from the sides of the parent plant and eventually break off, becoming independent adults. * Parachute Worm: A whitish-gray, earthworm-like creature that lives off the gas of the Sulfurian Balloon Plant by sucking it out. Newly-born larvae resemble twigs with two umbrella-like extensions. Larvae are born live as the mother is feeding. After a little while, the young depart from their mothers and use the umbrella-like extensions to parachute down gently through the murk of the atmosphere to the planet floor, after which the umbrellas are shed. After falling into water and shedding, the young Parachute Worms feed on the nutritious roots of the Sulfurian Balloon Plants. When they have fattened up, the adults make their epic journey back up the stalks to mate. The Parachute Worm is a perpetual migrant. Its lifecycle is a response to this extreme environment. =Epona= The next world visited is Epona, an imaginary ecosystem created by group of scientists and science fiction writers called The Epona Project and begun by Martyn J. Fogg. Epona is an offshoot of the Contact - Cultures Of The Imagination (COTI), a bi-yearly conference, where scientists and Science Fiction authors come together and discuss how the human race may progress in space. The 2012 event program is here.http://www.contact- conference.org/c12d.html James Funaro is a guest on the Space Show Blog #3466 Space Show Blog #3466 and describes one year's conference. The contact idea came from an original premise by Joel Hagen and James Funaro, instructor of Anthropology at Cabrillo College, Palo Alto. Two groups of COTI Attendees are provided with simulated planetary conditions, then have to devise a species to fit in that ecology and that develops spaceflight and has \\"First contact\\" with one another, one race may be human. The process was described in OMNI[3] magazine () \\"How to build an Alien\\" by Keith Ferrell This later developed into COTI - the roleplaying half simulating \\"first contact\\" and \\"The Bateson Project\\" - which is the strictly scientific disciplines come together. Science Fiction authors involved include Karen and Poul Anderson.

The \\"leaves\\" grow very large in order to get as much carbon dioxide as possible. While sessile, the trees are capable of a remarkable range of movement, a trait inherited from their mobile ancestors. If a \\"herbivore\\" comes to nibble on them, they are able to fold back their branches. * Spring Croc: A green, hopping, two-legged, predatory, Venus flytrap-like creature and the major predator on Epona. It lies in wait for its prey, usually while partially submerged. It's extremely vicious and mostly focuses on eating. It does not need to be intelligent, it just has to be quiet. * Uther: A brownish-gray flyer resembling a cross between a Sharovipteryx and a pterosaur. They are descended from flying fish- like ancestors. They started out in their avian-like lifestyle hunting Salacopods (small, amphibian-like creatures) and later adapted to feeding on larger carcasses. They then started to become predators themselves. In order to fly, they use a combination of hydrogen peroxide and ethanol to hyper- oxygenate their blood, which allows them incredible stamina. =Greenworld= The documentary then visits the science fiction world of Greenworld, which was created by Dougal Dixon. It is an Earth-like planet filled with lush rainforests. Featured organisms * Curlywhorl: An arboreal, purple-red, centipede/iguana-like creature evolved from aquatic, sea star-like ancestors like all the other inhabitants of Greenworld. * Pud: A small, green, three- eyed, weevil-like creature from Greenworld's equator. There are thousands of species across the planet. They are like the beetles of Earth. The featured species has six limbs, five of which are used for grasping and one for movement. This gives the Pud a hopping gait. They are often seen in groups, foraging for fallen fruit in the undergrowth. They have many predators and can sense danger coming with their three sensitive, leaf-like antennae. Puds make a series of chirps and hoots. * Kwank: A large, reddish-brown, robber crab- like creature from Greenworld with a turtle-like shell on its back. It feeds on Puds. * Unidentified large, lobster-like predator: An inhabitant of Greenworld that sometimes attacks and eats Kwanks. It's only shown in the form of its shadow. Artificial Life On Greenworld, the ship encounters an artificial lifeforms from a robotic cube ship. It uses solar panels to gather energy and mines asteroids to get resources to grow. It even sends down a probe resembling a metallic centipede to Greenworld to explore it. At the end of the film, the narrator is revealed to be a little green man-like female alien.

It is located at 1776 D Street NW, sharing a city block with the DAR's Administration Building was built in 1920, and Constitution Hall. Completed in 1910, it is the oldest of the three buildings. It was the site of the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, a major diplomatic event in the aftermath of World War I. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972. and Description Memorial Continental Hall occupies the eastern third of the city block bounded by C and D, 17th and 18th Streets NW, on the west side of the Ellipse near the White House. It is a two-story masonry structure, built out of brick and concrete whose exterior is clad in Vermont marble with Georgian revival features. Its three street-facing elevations all have monumental two-story porticos with Doric columns. The principal entrance, facing east toward 17th Street and the Ellipse, is extended to function as a porte cochere, with a drive passing under it. The south portico is semi-circular, with thirteen columns. History Memorial Continental Hall was commissioned by the DAR in 1902 to be used as a headquarters, assembly hall, and meeting place for DAR conferences. Architect Edward Pearce Casey designed the building, and construction occurred between 1904 and 1910. It was the first of three DAR buildings erected on the same site. The nearby Administration Building was built in 1920, and Constitution Hall was built at the opposite end of the site in 1929. The Administration Building was expanded in 1950 to unite all three buildings. The final act of the 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession, initiated by Alice Paul, was a meeting at the Memorial Continental Hall. Speakers were Anna Howard Shaw, Carrie Chapman Catt, Mary Johnston, and Helen Adams Keller. Memorial Continental Hall was the site of the Washington Naval Conference in 1921-22, a major diplomatic meeting in which the major powers of the world agreed to limit the sizes and capabilities of their naval forces. The hall was loaned to the American Red Cross in 1943 for emergency wartime work. In 1949, the stage in the auditorium was removed and the room was converted to a library. Gallery File:D.A.R.

Born in King and Queen County, Virginia, to William Clarke Hundley and Marion Street Hundley, John Hundley was raised by his maternal grandparents, John Walker Street and Frances Street, following the death of his mother in 1843. Hundley attended Richmond (VA) College from 1858 until 1861, when he joined the 26th Virginia Infantry of the Confederate Army, as second lieutenant, under the command of his uncle, Capt. Napoleon B. Street. Following the Civil War, he entered the Crozer Theological Seminary and was ordained to the Baptist ministry in November 1876 at Mechanicsville Church in Hanover County, Virginia. He began his ministry on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, at Modesttown and Chincoteague. In 1877, he organized a new congregation - the Atlantic Baptist Church - and, throughout the 1870s and 1880s, served as pastor of seven additional churches on the Eastern Shore. In 1890, he was called to Tarboro, North Carolina, where he led the effort to construct a new church building there. From 1897 to 1904, he served both as the moderator of the Augusta Association of Baptist churches and as the pastor of the Covington (VA) Baptist Church, where he spearheaded the erection of a new sanctuary, which was dedicated in 1902. Following his tenure at Covington, he returned to the Eastern Shore of Virginia and Maryland. Reverend Hundley married Virginia M. Quarles, of Louisa County, Virginia, in 1865, with whom he had seven children. He died in October 1914 at the Covington home of his daughter, Augusta Hundley Rinehart.

The Sethi family was involved in considerable welfare work in Peshawar and had contributed to the construction of wells for the poor, along with the Lady Reading Hospital and the Islamia College Mosque.Cultural evening at historical Sethi House today Saturday, May 10, 2008 The downfall of the Sethis began during the Russian Revolution in 1917, when their businesses experienced setbacks from which they never recovered, forcing them to leave Central Asia and return to Peshawar.

Before his tenure as district attorney, Carmouche graduated from Loyola University New Orleans Law School in 1969 and worked as an assistant in the DA's office from 1974 to 1977. Carmouche was also a one-time candidate for the United States House of Representatives for Louisiana's 4th congressional district, having narrowly lost that race to Republican challenger John C. Fleming in 2008. Biography Paul Carmouche was born and reared in Napoleonville in Assumption Parish in south Louisiana, where he attended public schools. He received his Juris Doctor degree in 1969 from Loyola University New Orleans College of Law, where he was President of the Law School student body. He was admitted to the State Bar of Louisiana in 1969. Carmouche was first married to the former Margaret Adeline Looney (1945-2017), the daughter of the late Frank O'Neill and Beatrice Mae Burgoyne Looney. Margaret was a speech pathologist who was a member of the first graduating class in 1973 at LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport.

Paul and Margaret have a daughter, Marianna Carmouche Clement (born c. 1979), who is married to Scott Clement of Dallas, Texas. Marianna has worked for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. From his second marriage to the former Marti Hudson Dillman (born November 1960), Carmouche acquired a step-son, Matt Marshall Dillman (born April 1988).  Law career After law school, Carmouche joined a small civil law firm, and handled civil and criminal cases for four years, before joining the Caddo Parish District Attorney's office in October 1973 as an Assistant District Attorney (ADA). From the DA's office, he went on to serve as Chief Counsel Indigent Defender Office from 1977 to 1978.

Carmouche is a past president of the Louisiana District Attorney‚Äôs Association, and is admitted to practice before the Federal 5th Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court. Carmouche retired as district attorney in January 2009 and now is a criminal defense attorney in private practice. 2008 Congressional race In February 2008, Carmouche announced that he would not seek re-election as District Attorney. On March 19, 2008, Carmouche announced that he would run for the congressional seat vacated by retiring Republican Jim McCrery, who held the seat since the spring of 1988.

While with Hibs he won the Scottish League Cup of 1972, in a 2‚Äì1 victory in the final, against Celtic. Despite being born in the south of England, Cropley was eligible for Scotland and he was selected for matches played against Belgium and Portugal in 1971. Late in 1974, Cropley moved to London where he turned down an offer from Chelsea to play for Arsenal, whom he signed for in a deal worth ¬£150,000. He made his debut for the Gunners against Carlisle United on 7 December 1974. Cropley then broke his leg in a match away to Middlesbrough in January 1975 and broke it again soon after his comeback. He returned to make 22 appearances in the 1975‚Äì76 season, but could not secure a regular place in Arsenal's first team. He then linked up with Aston Villa in September 1976, having played 30 league games with five goals scored altogether for Arsenal. At Villa, he featured in a memorable win against the great Liverpool side of the period. Cropley also appeared in the League Cup Final of 1977 against Everton. The final needed to be replayed after the game ended in a draw. The second final saw the two teams once again finish the game tied altogether. In the eventual third final, with the game going to extra time, Villa won by a 3‚Äì2 margin over the Toffees and in so doing Cropley victoriously lifted the Cup. He thereafter yet again suffered another a broken leg, upon 10 December 1977. Cropley then had a spell on loan at Newcastle United from January to June 1980, returning to Villa in July of that year. Cropley left Villa Park in March 1981 to feature a month later for club Toronto Blizzard in the North American Soccer League. He then left Blizzard in October 1981 and to link up in the following month for Portsmouth. He then ended his days as a professional footballer in 1982 due to persistent and serious injuries at the relatively young age of 31. Personal life After his playing days came to an end, Cropley became a taxi driver within his hometown of Edinburgh. His son Jordan is also a footballer, who played for Hibernian's academy. Jordan went on to feature for Scottish clubs Berwick Rangers, Arniston Rangers and Haddington Athletic. Cropley authored an autobiography entitled Crops: The Alex Cropley Story which was released in 2013.

Jakob Kolletschka is mostly known for his death which eventually led Ignaz Semmelweis to his discovery of the etiology of childbed fever. Below is a quote from the original reference describing the details of his death. In a lecture in 1846 he is reputed to have said, \\"It is here no uncommon thing for midwives, especially in the commencement of their practice, to pull off legs and arms of infants, and even to pull away the entire body and leave the head in the uterus. Such occurrences are not altogether uncommon; they often happen.\\" Lancet 2 (1855): 503. Quoted in  Death  Semmelweis had left for Venice on 2 March 1847 to escape the many deaths at the Viennese maternity institution, which haunted him. He returned to Vienna on 20 March 1847. > I was immediately overwhelmed by the sad news that Professor [Jakob] > Kolletschka, whom I greatly admired, had died in the interim. > The case history went as follows: Kolletschka, Professor of Forensic > Medicine, often conducted autopsies for legal purposes in the company of > students. During one such exercise, his finger was pricked by a student with > the same knife that was being used in the autopsy. I do not recall which > finger was cut.

Like the radio program, the series is hosted by Ira Glass. The series premiered on March 22, 2007. Two seasons of the show have aired on Showtime. The second season finale aired on September 3, 2008, and Showtime aired one final episode in May 2009. In September 2009, Glass announced that he and the other creators of the show had \\"asked to be taken off TV\\", largely in part to the difficult schedule required to produce a television program.WBEZ official blog: \\"Exclusive: Ira Glass dishes on end of TAL TV. Will he return to Chicago? \\" He went on to state that the show is officially \\"on hiatus\\", but would like to do a television special at some point in the future. From January 10 to April 4, 2011, Current TV re-aired the series in its entirety.  Adaptation for television  The television version of This American Life is a twofold shift in media from public radio to commercial television. The TAL staff had already attempted to move their program to television once before in 1999. Even though two different networks offered to screen a pilot, the TAL staff ultimately decided that it would be too difficult to make a television show that reflected its already successful weekly radio show. In 2002, Showtime offered to shoot a pilot, to which the TAL staff eventually agreed. In 2007, the first episode, \\"Reality Check\\", aired on television. When the staff was asked why the show moved to a commercial television station, Showtime, instead of public television (i.e., PBS), it responded that Showtime invited them to do a television show while PBS did not. This American Life still runs weekly on public radio distributed by the Public Radio Exchange (formerly distributed by Public Radio International) Episodes =Season 1 (2007)= =Season 2 (2008‚àí09)= Reception =Critical reviews= Season one was well received. Giving the program four stars, People magazine said the series has an \\"offbeat sensibility and a reflective, compassionate intelligence,\\" and said that the hosts \\"overarticulate the ironies instead of just letting you watch. Which you should do. Watch.\\" Entertainment Weekly gave the show a B+, saying \\"handsomely produced experimental series ought to please flexible fans‚Äîas well as so many more who are new to the notion of an artful grab-bag documentary series about real people describing little realities.\\" Commenting on where the program fell in \\"quirk\\" culture, Michael Hirschorn of the Atlantic said \\"the rhythms [of the show] are lulling, and everyone involved appears to be‚Äîis‚Äîsmart, idiosyncratic, charmingly self-effacing, well-meaning,\\" but added that \\"radio listeners can't really fight through Glass's scrim, so they have to take his word that the story is what he says it is. In the harsh light of television, however, the affectations of the radio show become glaringly clear.\\" Season two continued to get good reviews. Entertainment Weekly again gave the program a B+, saying, \\"Purists can rest easy, as the televised version continues to lose nothing in translation.\\" People calls it a \\"superb series.\\" The A.V. Club named the episode \\"John Smith\\" one of the top ten episodes of the decade, saying, \\"it successfully blends the atmosphere of the radio series with the approach of a top-notch documentary to create one of the most moving non- fiction films of the decade...It‚Äôs the kind of riveting television that you stumble upon at 1 a.m. in a motel room and can‚Äôt switch off. = Awards and nominations = In 2007, the series won two Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Nonfiction Series and Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming. It was also nominated for Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming, Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming and Outstanding Editing for Nonfiction Programming. In 2008, the series was nominated for three Primetime Emmy Awards: Outstanding Cinematography for Nonfiction Programming, Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming, and Outstanding Writing for Nonfiction Programming.  Home releases  Season one of the series was released on DVD exclusively to Borders bookstores in January 29, 2008. On May 19, 2008, Showtime announced the release would \\"go wide\\" to other retailers on September 23, 2008. Season two was released on DVD to Borders on January 20, 2009.

It has been the home of Eastleigh F.C. since 1957 when they moved from Walnut Avenue.Eastleigh Pyramid Passion The ground's record attendance is 5,025 for an FA Cup third round match against Bolton Wanderers on 9 January 2016.Beleaguered Bolton take respite from Darren Pratley rescue at Eastleigh The Guardian, 10 January 2016 History Eastleigh moved to Ten Acres in 1957 from their previous ground Walnut Avenue. In 1976 floodlights were installed. In 2004, following promotion to the Isthmian League, the old wooden stand was knocked down and a new 352-seat grandstand was built on the halfway line, stretching for just under a third of the pitch. Behind the motorway end hard standing was hard standing with a cover, this was named the Silverlake Stand. In 2006, the roof was widened across the Silverlake Stand to cover the whole width of the pitch. Until 2006, the area opposite the grandstand was just hard standing backing into a tall fir trees. During the summer of 2006, a metal back and roof were added, along with an electronic scoreboard on the roof which was the Premier Telecom stand. In 2009, 150 seats were added to the middle of the Silverlake Stand to give Eastleigh the necessary ground grading to compete in the Conference South playoffs. On 20 December 2012, concerning the situation regarding the stadium, the club announced that an offer had previously been made to the board at ‚ÄòTen Acre Holdings‚Äô (the current owners). Following discussions the board of Ten Acre Holdings felt that they were willing to accept the offer presented to them as long as the remaining shareholders also felt a desire to sell the ground at this stage. On this basis a full shareholders meeting was called and the outcome was that a clear large majority were in favour of accepting the offer and that the sale of the freehold should progress. Ten Acre Holdings had been set up to safeguard the club and enable it to get back on a sound financial footing, which it has achieved over recent years. The proposed purchase was intended to provide the football club with the strongest possible opportunity to continue its progression. The ground was, again, extensively redeveloped during 2014. New pitch side fencing was installed following damage to the previous fencing during Eastleighs championship winning game against Basingstoke. The former East stand at Sandy Park (home of Exeter chiefs RFC) was rebuilt along the premier telecom side of the ground as well as behind the clubhouse goal providing a covered terraced accommodation for 2,000 spectators. On 2 December 2014, the newly completed 2,290-seater South Stand was opened for the first time in a Conference Premier game against Dartford with the club allowing spectators in for free to celebrate the occasion. The Mackoy Community Stand was officially opened on 28 February 2015 with a club and stadium record attendance of 4,126 for a conference premier match against Macclesfield, a live match on BT sport that Eastleigh won 4‚Äì0. The attendance record was broken a year later when 5,025 watched the club's FA Cup third round match against Bolton. During 2016‚Äì17 season work began on a double story building behind the goal to allow for Eastlegh FC to cater for its increased fanbase. The stand behind the clubhouse goal has been affectionately named the \\"shed end\\" and is where most vocal home fans congregate.

The baseball facility was officially renamed Childress Field at Hennon Stadium in a dedication ceremony on April 23, 1994. In 1978, the WCU baseball program moved approximately 200 yards to the east from Haywood Field. Bill Haywood, head baseball coach from 1969 through 1981, and Mr. E.J. Whitmire, a baseball supporter and benefactor from Franklin, North Carolina were the driving forces behind the building of the facility. The initial cost of the facility in 1978 was $125,000. It was named in honor of the late Ronnie G. Childress, who was a special friend of the baseball program. The James B. Childress family established the Ronnie Childress Memorial Fund Scholarships in 1975 and scholarships have been awarded annually to select WCU baseball players since the fund's inception. Hennon Stadium has been renovated several times since its construction and has become a showplace of Southern Conference baseball. Permanent bleacher seating, grandstand chair back seats, and a press box were installed prior to 1990 season. A new scoreboard, concession stands, rest rooms, and a new infield were added prior to the 1991 season. Childress Field was refurbished in 2003 with nearly $500,000 worth of improvements that included new drainage and irrigation, a Bermuda grass playing surface, a new warning track, and a new infield playing surface. The baseball field and stadium received yet another renovationgrfx.cstv.com in 2011 (of approx. $600,000) which included dugout upgrades, the entire stadium painted, new lower-level seating as the stadium was moved 14 feet closer to home plate to accommodate two rows of new chair-back seats.

Career Spoor was educated at a secondary school in The Hague, the cadet school in Alkmaar and the Royal Military Academy in Breda. In 1923 he was appointed as second lieutenant of infantry and was seconded to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army from 1924 in Dutch Borneo. From 1929 to 1932 he studied at the Higher War College in The Hague. After having served in the General Staff in Bandung for two years, in 1934 he took a position as teacher of strategy and tactics at the Royal Military Academy in Breda. In 1938, Spoor returned to the Dutch East Indies, as Head of the Political Affairs Department of the General Staff and the Higher War College in Bandung. He taught Laws of war and East Indies Martial law. He was also an employee of the military 'Javabode'.

Helmingham Hall ‚Äì a large red-brick quadrangular mansion ‚Äì dates from the reign of Henry VIII. The ancient family of Tollemache have been seated here from an early period after settling for a while at Bentley soon after the Norman conquest of England. A Lionel Tollemache married the heiress of the Helmingham family so acquiring this estate in the 15th century. The village was the birthplace of Faith Emmeline Backhouse, mother of the war poet John Gillespie Magee, Jr.. In 1900, excavations in the Rectory garden unearthed a cemetery, possibly Roman, containing some 25 graves.Campaign for Real Ale about Helmingham Present day The village is formed from the meeting of two roads, B1077 from the south-west to the north and B1079 from the south-east. Helmingham Hall is 500 metres west of this junction. Its village church of St Mary's was first built as the estate church for the Hall. The village appears never to have had a public house.

Colwyn Bay RFC is a member of the Welsh Rugby Union and is a feeder club for RGC 1404. History The first record of a match played in Colwyn Bay took place on the Rhos Preparatory School ground on New Year‚Äôs Day, 1923, when the opponents were a Chester XV. There were frequent changes in playing locations and changing rooms and consequently the game did not prosper after the promising start of the first few seasons. One success at that time was Wilf Wooler, a Club member who went on to represent Sale RFC, Cambridge University, Cardiff RFC and then Wales, starring in the 1935 Welsh victory over the All Blacks. In 1936 it was decided that the Club could not continue and players who were keen joined Rhyl and District RFC, who were also recipients of the goal posts. The princely bank balance of ¬£15 was handed to the North Wales Rugby Union. In 1953 rugby football became more firmly established in North Wales and a meeting was called at the Queens Hotel, Old Colwyn, at which 12 people attended. Led by a very active Secretary, Tom Bellis, aided by Rydal School (now Rydal Penrhos) masters and old players of the school, the foundations were laid for today‚Äôs successful club. A settled \\"home\\" was a long time coming but the local Council were most helpful in 1965 in providing us with a pitch at Glan-y-Don, Old Colwyn, and cow sheds which were part of Glan-y-Don Home Farm. The cowsheds were converted into adequate changing rooms and a licensed bar was also applied for and set up. Unfortunately, there was a further hitch in the late 1960s when the new Police H.Q. required part of the field and the Highway Authority acquired the other half of the pitch for the slip road from the A55 Expressway to Old Colwyn. The council came to our rescue once more and provided us with a long lease on our present ground at Brookfield Drive, which was donated, to the Council by the late Victor Wilde for recreational purposes. The ground consists of three flat adjoining pitches, training area, car park and Clubhouse. In September, 1975, the present Club House was officially opened by Mike Roberts, a Club member, Welsh International and a British Lion, and additional facilities of a lounge bar and gymnasium have been added since. The early nineties saw Colwyn Bay Rugby win the north Wales Championship twice prior to promotion to the National Leagues. Colwyn Bay Rugby currently fields a 1st XV that play in WRU Division Two (North). We also run second XV, Women's and Youth XV's as well as a vibrant and growing Mini & Junior Section.

The term \\"Brussels lace\\" has been broadly used for any lace from Brussels; however, the term strictly interpreted refers to bobbin lace, in which the pattern is made first, then the ground, or r√©seau, added, also using bobbin lace. Brussels lace is not to be confused with Brussels point, which is a type of needle lace, though is sometimes also called \\"Brussels lace\\". Brussels lace is well known for its delicacy and beauty. Originally it was only made from the finest spun linen thread, which was spun in dark damp rooms to keep the thread from becoming too brittle. Only one ray of light was allowed into the room, and it was arranged so that it fell upon the thread. This fine thread is part of what prevented mechanizing the process of making Brussels lace, as well as the production of it in other regions, as it could not be bought anywhere else. It was also what made the lace so costly. Brussels lace cost more than Mechlin lace, and was in high demand in England and France. Brussels lace started to be produced in the 15th century, and was first explicitly mentioned in England in a list of presents given to Princess Mary at New Years', 1543. Production Brussels lace is part lace. This is made in pieces, with the flowers and design made separate from the ground, unlike Mechlin lace or Valenciennes lace; because of this, the long threads that form the design always follow the curves of the pattern, whereas in bobbin laces made all at once, the threads are parallel to the length of the lace. Brussels lace is also distinguished by its r√©seau or background, the toil√© or pattern, and the lack of a cordonnet outlining the pattern. The r√©seau is hexagonal, with four threads plaited four times on two sides, and two threads twisted twice on the remaining four sides. The toil√© can be of two types, the standard woven texture like a piece of fabric, or a more open version with more of the appearance of a netted r√©seau. This allows for shading in the designs, an effect that was used more in the later designs. In Brussels lace, instead of a cordonnet, the pattern is edged with open stitches, which are then picked up to form the r√©seau. The first step was to spin the flax thread, which was then given to the lace-makers who made the pattern, which was generally of flowers. Then the lace-makers would make the r√©seau, hooking onto the open edge of the pattern, and working around the pattern to fill the ground. Point d'Angleterre In 1662, the English Parliament passed an act prohibiting the import of all foreign lace as there was considerable alarm at how much money was being spent on foreign lace, and the protection of English lace manufacturers took precedence. However, English lace merchants could not supply lace of the same quality as the Brussels lace, and Flemish lace-makers were reluctant to settle in England. England also produced inferior flax and thus could not spin the fine thread required, and so the lace produced was of an inferior quality. Since the merchants could not produce the lace at home, they resorted to smuggling and named the smuggled Brussels lace 'Point d'Angleterre,' \\"English point.\\" France also had regulations forbidding the importation of foreign lace, so the Brussels lace sold in France was sold under this name. To this day, all Brussels lace is called Point d'Angleterre in France. The ladies in the court of Louis XV greatly favored this lace. When the prohibition ended in 1699, Brussels lace gained popularity once more. Queen Anne bought a lot of it, despite the high price. In the courts of George I and George II, the lace became very popular, despite efforts to encourage native lace-making. It was used on ruffles, lappets, and flounces. Individual pieces were large and made of many one-inch to two and a half-inch pieces, sewn together seamlessly. This type of lace was made until the French Revolution. Point plat appliqu√© Point plat appliqu√© (\\"Applied flat point\\") is the term given to Brussels lace where the design is appliqued to machine net, instead of using handmade r√©seau. In 1810, in Nottingham, a machine that made extremely regular linen netting was perfected, and machine-made net became common. From this point on, the handmade r√©seau was only made upon request, and the designs were appliqued directly onto the machine-made net. This resulted in the designs becoming more spread out and less connected. This type can be distinguished from handmade net, as often the net is not cut away behind the appliqued design; thus, the net can be seen on the back of the design. Also, the machine-made net was made of diamond-shaped mesh, rather than the hexagonal r√©seau. Point Duchesse Point Duchesse (\\"Duchess point\\") is the term for a Belgian lace that does not have a r√©seau. It was named after the duchess of Brabant, Marie Henriette of Austria who was a supporter of the lace production. It is made entirely on the pillow; the pattern is made so that the leaves and flowers naturally join and there is rarely a bar thrown across to connect them. As there is no r√©seau, the designs are more continuous. Modern Brussels Laces There is still an existing production of Brussels lace made by hand in Belgium. This production is getting smaller and smaller as the workers are getting older, but there is still a hope it doesn't die out entirely. Two types of laces are still produced: The Renaissance lace is a needle work using a machine made tape. Even if the designs are not as intricate as the antique laces such as \\"Point de Rose\\" or \\"Duchess lace,\\" it remains intricate and still demands many hours of work. This lace had been developed in the early 20th century, but it became famous some years later. This work is strong and easy to wash. It's even adapted to be washed by machine. The Princess lace is also a form of needle work. It's an application on a netting. Machine-made nettings have been used since 1850 in the production of this type of lace. These first nettings were produced in the hope it could save time so that lacemakers could be able to finish work faster. In the early 20th century, the machine-made netting that could be produced was of a different quality, more regular, and produced in larger quantities. The production of Princess lace started at that time, but it was only after World War II that this lace really became famous. It's the last handmade lace work that's still fine enough to be used for wedding veil and christening gowns. As these two types of laces are made using a machine (for the tape or the netting), some purists don't believe these techniques should receive the 'Handmade Belgian lace' tag. Discussions are still ongoing about this in lace-making circles. However most people agree that these two modern lace making techniques require a great deal of skill and handwork (80%) to be realized, and it's unfortunately a dying art.

At the time the ground had a cinder track a quarter of a mile long. The first football match was played on 15 September 1923, with Crittall beating Great Leighs 4‚Äì0. A 400-seat grandstand was opened in December 1924 and the ground became the regular venue for the Essex Junior Cup, with a record football crowd of 6,000 attending for the 1926 final between Rayleigh Athletic and Saffron Walden. This was equalled in the 1928 final between Leigh Ramblers and Wimpole Road Wesleyans and an Essex Senior Cup semi-final between Chelmsford and Colchester Town in 1931. A non-football record of 8,000 was set for the Crittall Sport and Show in 1926. A second grandstand was opened during the 1932‚Äì33 season.

In the mid-1970s the ground had fallen into a state of disrepair and the club was forced to play at other venues for a time due to problems with the pitch. Half of the main stand was removed in the early 1970s and in January 1974 the rest of the stand which was badly damaged in a storm.Jon Weaver (2005) The Football Grounds of Rural Essex, pp8‚Äì10 With the ground being in such poor condition the club had to play at alternative venues These included Heybridge Swifts' Scraley Road (a single match on 26 April 1975 arranged at such short notice that many fans arrived at Cressing Road for the match and only 50 attended the game), Braintree Rugby Club's Tabor Avenue (at the start of the 1975‚Äì76 season) and the Courtaulds Sports Ground in Church Street in Bocking (a single match against Gorleston on 6 September 1975 with a crowd of 73). However, after winning the Eastern Counties League in 1983‚Äì84 the club began to upgrade the ground, building a new 292-seat grandstand at the end of the 1980s.

It is the story of a middle class bank employee, Madhav Apte, an ordinary, law-abiding and honest citizen who faces constant frustration with the injustice and corruption that pervades in all walks of his life. The film portrays Apte's mental breakdown as he reaches his breaking point, and his rampage as a vigilante across Mumbai to set things right. The film stars Sandeep Kulkarni in the lead with Shilpa Tulaskar and Sandesh Jadhav. The film bears resemblance to the 1993 Hollywood film Falling Down, starring Michael Douglas. Kamat remade the film in Tamil as Evano Oruvan with R. Madhavan playing the lead. Plot Madhav Apte (Sandeep Kulkarni) lives a lower-middle-class life in Dombivli area of Mumbai together with his wife Alka (Shilpa Tulaskar), son Rahul (Dushyant Wagh) and daughter Prachi (Srushti Bhoske). He travels to his workplace, Nariman Point, each day by train; and takes the Dombivli Fast local train to return home. Cheating, corruption, and dishonesty are something which he hated the foremost. He was a person with strong morals and principle , and lived life in step with it. Wherever he would see injustice and corruption, he would fight and argue; be it along with her wife or her daughter‚Äôs educator or perhaps his boss. Alka was jaded with Madhav‚Äôs adamant behavior and in a very fit of anger, had told him that his values and morals are only worth something if he can bring a change in society. Little did Alka know that her words would make a robust impact on Madhav! Then started the fight of Madhav against everyone who broke the foundations and was on the incorrect side of the law. Soon, his actions shook the complete city and brought a substantial change too. But how long will society allow Madhav to bring this change? And till what extent will Madhav achieve bringing a change? He's pushed to a corner by everybody who finds his path of righteousness too difficult to handle, and in some unspecified time in the future, he snaps. He goes on a rampage trying to correct everything that goes against his principles, and so starts mayhem on the streets of Mumbai, ultimately ending in a very tragic climax with him getting encountered.

In the early days of Mining Journal, then known as Mining Journal and Commercial Gazette, it carried information on a range of subjects, from mines, machinery and metals prices, to news items and stories of general interest. The early issues also provided a glossary of mining terms, updated regularly, and noted all known mine accidents. In 1963, The Mining Journal Ltd. took over rival publication, Mining Magazine, which had been founded in 1909 by Herbert Hoover, later to become President of the US, while he was a mining engineer then working in London.

Michael Coulson, author of The History of Mining, wrote that English believed with the Industrial Revolution in full swing and the mining industry providing the key raw materials driving industrialization, ‚Äúa regular publication recording and commenting on the issues facing mining was long overdue‚Äù ‚ÄúExposed to the oxygen of publicity it was clear that all was not well with the UK‚Äôs mining industry ‚Äì its size, excepting coal, was inadequate to provide all the needs of rapidly growing industries such as iron, steel and engineering,‚Äù Coulson wrote. ‚ÄúAt the same time, coal mining in the UK was dangerous and fatalities unacceptably common in the fast growing industry. ‚ÄúEnglish became something of a one-man protest movement and his commentaries became increasingly influential, culminating in his success in having a commission appointed to look into the Haswell Colliery disaster in Durham in 1844 following his direct appeal to Queen Victoria. ‚ÄúThe Mining Journal continued to campaign for reform of the mining industry and English‚Äôs efforts played a major part in the establishment of both the Royal School of Mines and the Camborne School of Mines.‚Äù The British Geological Survey also dates back 180 years, with the formation of the Ordnance Geological Survey in 1835. As indicated, Mining Journal campaigned vigorously for greater safety in mines and for the establishment of mining schools ‚Äì the Royal School of Mines opened in 1851 and Camborne School of Mines early in 1888. Up until 2005 it was owned and managed by independent company, Mining Journal Limited and that year ownership was transferred to publishing company, Mining Communications, which also produces Mining Magazine, Mining, People and the Environment, GeoDrilling International and World Tunnelling/Trenchless World.Chronology of The Mining Journal (Subscription or registration necessary).Mining Communications \\"Mining Journal Online\\" website.

It was completed in 1989 and has 37 floors, and is tied with One Superior Place for the 87th tallest building in the city. The building is owned by The Feil Organization, which purchased it from MetLife in 2002 for $139.4 million.  Architecture  The first four floors of the facade along Madison and LaSalle streets are made of the original marble facade from the Otis Building, the previous building on this site. The remainder of the facade is a dark cobalt blue with details in bright green. The east wall has two additional distinguishing features, a \\"zipper\\" of bay windows that run from the 19th floor to the top, and a semicircular indentation that runs from sidewalk level to the seventh floor. Moriyama & Teshima Architects designed this building, making it the tallest building in Chicago designed by a Canadian architecture firm. Holabird & Root, whose predecessor firm had designed the Otis Building on the site in 1912, served as associate architects. The use of the lower facade of the Otis Building, an example of facadism, has received mixed reviews. Chicago Tribune architecture critic Paul Gapp lauded the reuse of the old facade as a brave gamble that paid off and \\"fits its financial canyon environs in fine fashion and friendly compatability [sic].\\" Gapp particularly hailed the work of the structural engineering firm Cohen-Barreto-Marchertas in preserving the Otis Building's perimeter caissons. Gapp's successor Blair Kamin, in contrast, named it among downtown Chicago's ugliest buildings, calling it a \\"garish intruder\\" that \\"disrupts the stately architectural canyon of LaSalle Street with its blue and Ghostbusters-green upper stories\\". To Kamin, the mismatch between the old and new facades was \\"an object lesson in why facade-ectomies don't work.\\"  Vicinity  10 South LaSalle is located at the southwest corner of Madison and LaSalle streets in the LaSalle Street financial district. The LaSalle Street corridor is often referred to as a \\"canyon\\" due to the high number of skyscrapers there. Within the block, 10 South LaSalle adjoins 181 West Madison to the west and the Northern Trust Company Building to the south. Across the street, it faces Two North LaSalle (former site of the LaSalle Hotel) to the north, One North LaSalle to the northeast, and 11 South LaSalle to the east. 10 South LaSalle was built slightly earlier than its neighbor at 181 West Madison, and it was originally anticipated that both buildings might be part of a common design. As a result, the lobby at the western entrance, which faces onto a narrow pedestrian alley between the buildings, is more spacious than the lobby facing LaSalle Street. Although the building is within the West Loop‚ÄìLaSalle Street Historic District, it is considered a \\"non-contributing\\" property due to its having been built so recently.

In 1268 CE, Soma, a commander of King Narasimha III of the same dynasty made some additions. The temple houses the deity Harihara, a fusion of the Hindu Gods Vishnu and Shiva. The image of the deity is a fusion of the right vertical half of Shiva and left vertical half of Vishnu.Cousens (1926), p. 93 The image holds in its right hand, the attributes of Shiva and in the left hand, those of Vishnu. Legend According to a Hindu legend, a demon named Guha (or Guhasura) once lived in these parts and a considerable surrounding region, from Uchchangi Durga in the east, Govinahalu in the south, Mudanur in the west and Airani in the north was under his control. Guha successfully appeased Hindu god Brahma with his penance and obtained a boon, by virtue of which, it would be impossible for either Hari (Vishnu) or Hara (Shiva) to singly kill him. Guha then became a regular tormentor of gods and humans alike. In order to overcome Brahma's boon and eliminate Guha, Vishnu and Shiva together took the form of Harihara (a fusion), came down to earth and killed the demon.

It tells the darkly humorous tale of apparent acts of cannibalism from the point of view of a congressman on a snowbound train. It indirectly satirises the political system of the United States of America.  Synopsis  An old man on a train tells the story of the aforementioned congressmen, trapped on a train during a snow storm. It takes a week for the members of congress to resign themselves to cannibalism for survival, whereupon they hold ineffective elections to select candidates (victims), and follow proper parliamentary procedure. For example: \\"...Mr. Harris was elected, all voting for him but himself... his election should be ratified by acclamation, which was lost, in consequence of his again voting against himself.\\" The humor becomes darker, richer: \\"After breakfast we elected a man by the name of Walker, from Detroit, for supper. He was very good. I wrote his wife so afterward. He was worthy of all praise. I shall always remember Walker. He was a little rare, but very good. And then the next morning we had Morgan of Alabama for breakfast. He was one of the finest men I ever sat down to, handsome, educated, refined, spoke several languages fluently, a perfect gentleman, he was a perfect gentleman, and singularly juicy.\\" Having finished his story, the old man departs the train, but the conductor clarifies to the shocked listener: \\"He was a member of Congress once, and a good one. But he got caught in a snow-drift in the cars, and like to have been starved to death. He got so frost-bitten and frozen up generally, and used up for want of something to eat, that he was sick and out of his head two or three months afterward. He is all right now, only he is a monomaniac, and when he gets on that old subject he never stops till he has eat up that whole car-load of people he talks about.\\"  Analysis  The story uses wordplay to raise to the foreground the latent double meanings that accompany political discourse. It is framed as a second-hand story heard by another train rider, with the narrator using the vernacular and mannerisms of a politician rather than a common man. The conclusion of the story leaves open to interpretation whether the entire story might be a fabrication or might be true but masked away from the popular conscience.

He is the former Minority Leader of the Senate. Kessler previously served as President of the Senate/Lieutenant Governor, Acting President of the Senate and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Kessler is also involved in private practice, where he is a partner in the law firm Berry, Kessler, Crutchfield, Taylor & Gordon. Kessler was born November 16, 1955 in Wheeling, West Virginia. He is the son of George Henry Kessler (1924‚Äì2009) and Rosemary Krupica Kessler (1930‚Äì1978). He is a 1974 graduate of Bishop Donahue High School in McMechen, West Virginia. He also attended West Liberty State College (now West Liberty University) near Wheeling, West Virginia, and the West Virginia University College of Law in Morgantown, West Virginia. Kessler unsuccessfully ran for the Democratic nomination in the 2011 gubernatorial election, losing to Earl Ray Tomblin, and in the 2016 gubernatorial election, losing to Jim Justice. Biography Jeff Kessler was born in 1955, he is of Russian descent on his mother's side. His father served in the US Navy during World War II and the Korean War, then later worked as a cookie salesman for Nabisco, he would bring home free samples and damaged cookies which Kessler enjoyed as a child. His mother stayed at home and took care of Jeff and his three siblings. Jeff's younger brother, Chris, was diagnosed with a plastic anemia when he was a toddler, he went into remission and survived. In 1994, Chris was elected Marshall County Assessor. Kessler's mother later died of breast cancer at the age of 47. Positions =SCORE Initiative= In 2014, Kessler spearheaded the SCORE Initiative, which stands for Southern Coalfields Organizing and Revitalizing the Economy. The initiative aims to provide economic opportunities in areas which have suffered from job losses and economic hardships primarily due to losses in the coal industry. According to Kessler, the program acts as a counterpunch to the effects of the \\"war on coal\\" and aims to \\"change our way of thinking so that [Southern West Virginia] can once again become a region that offers our children and grandchildren opportunities for a better future.\\" =Gun control= Kessler has previously voted in favor of a bill that eliminated the requirement for a permit and training before a person can carry a concealed weapon. He refers to himself as a \\"second amendment advocate.\\" =Tobacco tax= In 2015, Kessler proposed raising the state cigarette tax by $1 per pack, stating that a $1 increase in the cigarette tax would bring in an estimated $130 million. Citing West Virginia's relatively high smoking rate, he has proposed setting aside $20 million of the new revenue for substance abuse programs; this move comes as part of a larger effort He also hopes to set aside $10 million of the money for collegiate scholarships. The idea began to receive increased support in late 2015, with some newspaper boards citing the higher rates of neighboring states and comparing West Virginia's \\"arbitrarily low\\" rates to government subsidies for smokers.

In 1999, Paris and its surrounding areas amalgamated to form the County of Brant. Before that time each community was served by its own separate library. = Paris = Paris branch, a Carnegie library. In 1841 Hiram Capron, founder of Paris and twenty-five residents formed the Paris Mutual Institute for the purpose of Lectures, Circulating Library and Scientific experiments. Later that year the name was changed to the Paris Mechanics' Institute so that the organization could apply for government grants. In 1858 Paris' first public library was established when a lot located at 7 Grand River Street North in Paris was purchased from Hiram Capron for $150. The Paris library then expanded after receiving a Carnegie grant in 1902 and the new free public library was located at 12 William Street, where the library remains today. The branch was renovated and expanded again in 1995. = Scotland-Oakland = Scotland-Oakland branch The Scotland-Oakland branch of the library system is located at 281 Oakland Road, Scotland, Ontario. The branch has been at its current location since March 2005. Before that time the Scotland library enjoyed a long history in its community: a small library opened its doors to the public in 1894. In 1910 the librarian sold the building to the Scotland Library Trustees for $125; the cost of a library card in 1911 was 50 cents for the first card and 25 cents for the next. By 1938 the library had a home in a white frame building with a town bell on its roof which served as a fire alarm for the residents of Scotland. On October 10, 1967 under By-law No. 844 \\"To Establish a Township Public Library\\", Scotland Library became the Oakland Township Public Library. In 1973 the Oakland Township Library purchased a house which was converted into the library and opened in 1974. Twenty years later the bell from the original building was unveiled to commemorate 100 years of library service in Scotland. When the County of Brant amalgamated in 1999 the Oakland Library joined its system; in 2005 a brand new facility was unveiled with the name Scotland-Oakland Branch. = Burford = Burford branch The current Burford branch, located at 24 Park Avenue, Burford, Ontario, opened its doors in 2007. It is the county's second largest branch at almost . The Burford community has had a long library history, with its first public library created in the 1890s. The library closed in 1910 and was not formerly reopened until 1966 as the Burford Public Library. This library, located on King Street East in Burford, became part of Ontario's South Central Regional Library system. In 1999 Burford amalgamated with the new County of Brant, and a new branch was built and opened in October 2007. = St. George = St. George branch The St. George branch was first formed in 1878 as a Mechanics' Institute and was housed in the back room of their association hall. In 1893 the local newspaper reported that there were 3000 titles in the collection and that over 2300 loans were enacted that year. It moved to new quarters behind the post office in the new century and joined with the Glen Morris library, the only other library in the county, to form the South Dumfries Public Library. The library went into severe decline between the two World Wars, thought to be caused by the Depression, and it took a concerted effort by a number of the towns people to resurrect its collection. Plays were produced in the town's Memorial Hall to raise funds for new books. This became a yearly event for some time. St. George and Glen Morris retained that name until the amalgamation of Brant County in 1999; at about this time the branch moved from its old location to its new spot at 78 Main Street North. = Glen Morris = Glen Morris branch The Glen Morris Branch is located at 474 East River Road, Glen Morris, Ontario. In 1875 a Penny Reading Society was founded in Glen Morris to provide entertainment and education during the long winter months. In February 1888 the funds of the society were transferred to a Mechanics' Institute. The Institute ran until 1910 when it was changed to a public library under the Provincial Library Act. In 1966 the library in Glen Morris became part of the township library system, then in 1967 joined the newly designed regional system which increased circulation from over 2000 books in 1966 to over 8000 books in 1967. In 1971 the library was renovated by volunteers. In 1999 with the amalgamation of the County of Brant, the Glen Morris Library became part of the County of Brant Public Library. The library still exists in its original location, though the back room, previously administrative offices, is now rented as an apartment.

History Prior to the Norman Conquest it is recorded that Ellerdine was held by a free man named Dodo. It is next recorded that Henry II gifted the manor to Iorwerth Goch as a reward for his services as an interpreter during the Welsh-English border wars. The manor subsequently passed through several hands. By the nineteenth century, the manor was in the possession of Henry de Vere Vane, 9th Baron Barnard of the County of Durham. Following his death in 1918, the manor passed to his son Christopher William Vane, 10th Baron Barnard, who in 1930, split up the manor and sold off the plots, giving first refusal to the tenants, many of whom took the opportunity to purchase their own properties. Historically there was a standing stone within the village, thought to date from medieval times but it has recently been removedThe Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map: Ellerdine Heath Standing Stone (Menhir) In 1926, fourteen council houses were built near the village school, each with its own pigsty, they all shared a communal water pump. Twenty-eight years later in 1954 another ten homes were constructed opposite and the area received a brick water tower complete with an electric pump to supply water to all the houses. This remained in use until 1965, when mains water was piped to the village. John Beard (1871-1950), the trade union leader, was born at Ellerdine Heath, educated at the local Primitive Methodist day school, and died while staying at the village. His ashes were scattered in nearby Rowton churchyard.Article by Jean Beard. The railway Ellerdine Halt was a stop on the Wellington and Market Drayton Railway, which was opened in 1867 and operated by the Great Western Railway Company. In 1930, Ellerdine Siding was opened, with a large weighbridge and a brick hut for its custodian. However, lack of use forced the line to close to passenger traffic on 9 September 1963, and to freight four years later. The bridge which carried the road over the station is still in use.http://archelou.co.uk/ercall_photos/Railway%20line.htm Religion and Education The Wesleyan Methodists are the only religious group to build a place of worship within the village boundaries. Emmanuel Chapel was opened at Ellerdine Heath in 1813. However, in 1847, a section of the congregation split away to establish a Primitive Methodist group, they built another Chapel further down the lane, which was named Bethel Chapel and in 1866 they opened a Methodist day school attached.[former] Bethel Methodist Chapel, Ellerdine, Shropshire The two chapels rejoined in the late 1960s, the Bethel Chapel was closed and demolished and the Emmanuel Chapel was renamed The Ellerdine Heath Wesleyan Methodist Chapel and is still in use todayEllerdine Heath Wesleyan Methodist Chapel, ShropshireThe Shropshire Village Book, SFWI 1988, Pg64 The Anglican community in Ellerdine worship at All Hallows Church in the nearby village of Rowton.

The Greyhound The main thrill ride at Lakewood Fairgrounds was the Greyhound. The Greyhound was the old wooden roller coaster that was featured in all three Smokey and the Bandit films. Designed by John A. Miller, it was in operation from 1915 to 1974. The Greyhound was out of service during the early part of the 1956 season due to a major rebuild. After 1974, it sat out of operation for a number of years while the crowds at the fair continued to dwindle around it. Then, after a final repaint, its destruction was captured on film as a scene in the film Smokey and the Bandit II.

He founded Brott Music Festival in 1988 and the National Academy Orchestra of Canada in 1989. The festival re-introduced music education performances to Hamilton in 1999. Since then, the NAO has performed for over 144,000 schoolchildren from across southern Ontario. It is estimated that Boris Brott has introduced classical music to one million children during his career. He has written over 300 scripted children's concerts, such as Welcome Bach, Meet Mr. Beethoven; Trick or Treat to a Wicked Beat; There's an Animal in My Orchestra; Boris the Explorer: So You Want to Sing?; and J.S. Bach Meets Glenn Gould. Brott Music Education Concert highlights over the past nine years have included: * The Sophia Diaries: A Musical Exploration of Canada in the 1840s * The Underground Railroad: A Musical Journey narrated by Hon. Lincoln Alexander * Animal Crackers with Ottawa Dance Studio * Music in Space with astronaut Marc Garneau * From Ghost Ships to Space Ships: Musical Explorations with astronaut Roberta Bondar * Music & The Inuit Spirit with throat singers, drum dancers, and soapstone carvers * Melodies & Myths: A celebration of Aboriginal Music featuring the world premiere of Barbara Croall's Mi'degaawen The second category is for middle school grades 4-8 and is based on curriculum worked out with teachers and arts consultants on the BMF Education Committee. These programs can be based around the life of a composer and often feature an actor portraying Mozart, Beethoven, or Dvorak. Programming selections must contain excerpts of varying styles and colours representative of that particular composer. Programs inculcate contemporary Canadian composition since they illustrate the influence that specific composer may have had on another contemporary Canadian composer.

History A 6‚Äì1 friendly defeat against Premier League club Nottingham Forest in 1992 marked the official opening of the Bryan Smith memorial dressing rooms. 1994 saw the construction of the Willy White Suite, the seated Main Stand and the Claudine Morley (South) Stand. Structure and facilities Entry is via turnstile at the north end of the stadium, which has a covered standing area behind the goal. Mesh protects the Bryan Smith memorial dressing rooms. A separate canteen building named the Willy White Suite stands beside the dressing rooms. On the half way line there is an integrated press box and dugout structure, which includes a gantry for television cameras. The covered Arthur Simpson Stand, with two rows of bench seating, runs down to the John Wilkinson Stand, a standing terrace which runs along the south end of the pitch. The Main Stand, the Weston's stand, has four rows of individual tip-up seats which provide covered seating for approximately 250 spectators.

Bukr√°n helped Charleroi to a fourth-place finish in 1993‚Äì94 and qualification for European competition in three out of his four years in Belgium. In 1997 he moved to Spain to play for C√≥rdoba CF in the Segunda Divisi√≥n B. After only one season he moved to Xerez CD, who also played in Segunda Divisi√≥n B. In his two years in Spain, Bukr√°n played 47 league games and scored 5 goals. In the summer of 1999 Bukr√°n came to the attention of English side Walsall and on 5 August 1999 he signed a two-year contract with the newly promoted First Division side. He quickly became a fans' favourite but could not prevent the team's relegation on the final day of the season.

Development A predecessor of the L-40 was a sports and touring plane M-1 Sokol of wooden construction. Next there was a sports plane with V-tail LD-40, designed by Zdenek Rubliƒç. Its prototype XLD-40 was flown on 30 July 1950, however, it did not meet required performance and was abandoned. In 1954 the design of a further improved variant, the LD-40 started again, with the tail changed to a conventional one. The plane had a number of shortcomings, and further work continued. Eventually the aircraft was redesigned as a four-seater touring aircraft, under the designation L-40 Meta Sokol. The prototype of the L-40, the XL-40, flew first on 29 March 1956. Another prototype flew in August 1956, introducing some simplification of construction. In 1957 the aircraft entered production, and by 1959, 106 were built. The first series of 10 aircraft had 77 kW (103 hp) Walter Minor III-4 engine, with the remainder powered by more powerful (103 kW (138 hp)) Walter M-332 engines. Four persons sat in two rows, with dual controls. An unusual feature is the inverted tricycle gear, with main gear near the wing's leading edge and relatively big rear wheel near the wing's rear edge, which resulted in the fuselage being almost horizontal on the ground. Use The primary user was the Czechoslovak civilian aviation. Over half of production was exported to 16 countries, among others to Germany, Great Britain, Switzerland and Australia. Several FAI world records were set on the L-40. Description The L-40 Meta Sokol is a single-engine low-wing cantilever monoplane of metal construction. It features a fuselage built of a frame in the front part, of semi-monocoque in rear part, and is duralumin covered. Additionally, it features a duralumin covered trapezoid three-part wing, fitted with split flaps. It has a conventional tail, with its steering surfaces covered with canvas. The tail fin is high and trapezoidal. The plane has four seats in two rows, with twin controls in front. All are placed under a slim, partly glazed, rearwards-sliding canopy. At the rear, there is some luggage space. It has an inline engine in front, with a two-blade V-410 tractor propeller of a variable pitch. An unusual feature is its retractable inverted tricycle gear. The main gear's wheels are only half hidden in wings, making emergency landings safer. The aircraft's fuel tanks are in the wings, and small, teardrop-shaped tanks could be fitted to the wingtips.

The first sought to undo the feudal structure that had persisted after the unification of the Danubian Principalities in 1859; the second, more drastic reform, tried to resolve lingering peasant discontent and create social harmony after the upheaval of World War I and extensive territorial expansion; the third, imposed by a mainly Communist government, did away with the remaining influence of the landed aristocracy but was itself soon undone by collectivisation (considered by some as yet another land reformVerdery, p.45.), which the fourth then unravelled, leading to almost universal private ownership of land today. 1864 reform The 1864 land reform was the first of its kind in Romania, taking place during the reign of Alexandru Ioan Cuza. It came on the heels of the secularization of monastery estates, achieved in December 1863 on Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu's initiative and taking over a quarter of the country's area away from the Orthodox Church. The question of land reform was an essential point of Cuza's political programme, and he and KogƒÉlniceanu had wider aims: the abolition of compulsory labour and the establishment of private small holdings.Koehler, p.77. Conservative landowners expressed opposition in Parliament, leading to a bitter political struggle culminating in its dissolution in the coup of 2 May 1864. The draft law was written by the Council of State, amended by the Government and promulgated by the prince on 14/26 August 1864. His proclamation announced to the peasants: \\"The corv√©eClaca in Romanian: \\"A characteristic form of feudal income, consisting of free labour that the landless peasant was obliged to perform for the landowner's benefit\\". DEX is forever abolished and you are henceforth free proprietors in the places subjected to your control\\".Stoica, p.286. The law freed peasants from feudal tasks: the corv√©e, the tithe,Dijma, here a secular term: \\"Levy that represented a tenth of the main products, taken by feudal masters from the producers; later a form of feudal landed income which consisted of the cession by the peasant to the landowner of a part of the production obtained from the piece of land received from the latter for cultivation\\". DEX the transport taxPodvada: \\"Obligation to which dependent peasants were subjected in the Middle Ages for the owner's benefit (especially in wartime), which consisted of short-term labour (transport, carting) or in temporary requisition of pack animals\\". DEX and maintenance days;Zile de meremet it did away with feudal monopolies in the villages, at the same time specifying that compensation would be paid to the owners. Thus, for 15 years,Koehler, p.77 gives 35 years. in order to defray the cost of their no longer performing the corv√©e and the other feudal duties, peasants were required to pay into an indemnity fund that issued bonds redeemable in instalments an annual fee of 51-133 lei, depending on their category and region; this was a heavy burden for the majority and ruined the poorest.Hitchins 1996, p.311 They also had to pay for the land they now owned, albeit at a price below market value. The quantity of expropriated land was not to exceed ‚Öî of the domains' area (the boyars kept the best third, taking advantage of a provision calling for the consolidation, wherever possible, of pastures, hayfields and arable plots scattered by successive inheritances in order to get rid of their poorest quality land) and selling or mortgaging the lots was forbidden for 30 years, after which the village commune could exercise its right of pre-emption. This reform gave 1,654,965 ha (6,389.86 mi¬≤)Koehler p.77 gives over 2,000,000 ha. Hitchins 1996 p.310 gives 1,810,311 hectares to 463,554 families (or about 4 ha per family), about 60,000 of which only received land for a house and garden (including childless widows, minors and non-corv√©e labourers. of land to 406,429 peasants; another 60,651 received lots only for a house and garden. Later, 48,432 additional families of newlyweds (who did not come under the law's provisions but were permitted to settle on state-owned lands near their village) received 228,329 hectares.Hitchins 1996, p.310 Implementation of the law was by and large complete by 1865 but was slowed by a lack of comprehensive regulations concerning both general procedures and special cases; moreover, friction between landlords and peasants ensued because the latter had no confidence in the private surveyors hired by landlords to delimit their new holdings from the rest of the estate. In the year following 1864, agricultural production stagnated or even fell in some regions, partly because many owners had done nothing to compensate for the loss of the corv√©e, and also because many peasants did not know what land would be theirs and were reluctant to raise crops that might not be theirs, but by the spring of 1866 production once again rose. After the reform, land owned by peasants (that is, former corv√©e members,ClƒÉca≈üi free peasantsRƒÉze≈üi: \\"Free peasants, organised in communes, who together worked the land of the village where they lived, but worked independently (as families) the agricultural lot assigned to them\\". DEX and small proprietorsMo≈üneni: \\"Free peasants, joint possessors of land property inherited from a common ancestor\\". DEX) covered around 30% of the national territory, with 70% still in state or landlord hands. The reform had important social consequences, giving the peasants a civic motivation and assuring them a means of subsistence; it was also enshrined in the 1866 Constitution.Article 20 read: \\"Property given to the peasants through the rural law and the compensation guaranteed to owners through that law can never be touched\\". 1866 Constitution. Nevertheless, three factors undermined the reform. First, too little land was assigned to too many candidates even though many farmers were excluded from the redistribution and went on working in semi-serfdom on the boyars' estates. Second, demographic increase caused devastating rural overpopulation. Third, inheritance practices based on equally divided portions led to deep property fragmentation. Thus, the new landowners quickly ran into debt and because of the inadequate banking system had to borrow from boyars, large tenants or usurers at exorbitant interest rates. Instead, some peasants transferred the land back to the former owners and continued working it essentially as before.Koehler, p.77-8. This new system of dependency prompted by the lack of arable land and pasture was dubbed \\"neo-serfdom\\" (neoiobƒÉgie) by the Marxist theorist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea.Hitchins 1994, p.167. Moreover, forests, essential for many households' economic well-being, were excluded from distribution; peasants could use them for fifteen years, after which the landlord could reclaim his property rights to them. The reform also gave rise to political clash: the Liberals saw it as a starting point for dynamic, reasoned change, while the majority of Conservatives tried to use the 1864 law to defend their property against further expropriation, believing the social question had been resolved.Hitchins 1994, p.25. By 1913, Romania was the world's fourth-largest wheat exporter, but the issue of inequitable land distribution became persistently troublesome (and indeed was exacerbated that year when Romanian peasants fought in the Second Balkan War, witnessing first- hand the far more equitable land distribution scheme in place in BulgariaPhinnemore, David. The EU and Romania: Accession and Beyond, p.5. 2006, The Federal Trust for Education & Research, .). In the late 19th century about 2,000 landowners controlled over half the land while peasants (with little representation in government as well as limited access to land and ownership rights) had just a third. In 1888 peasant discontent with inequitable land distribution resulted in bloody confrontations that brought about partial and ineffective agrarian reforms. The unequal system continued to drive the peasantry into bankruptcy and seemed to lead increasingly toward a system of absentee ownership. Almost two decades later, a second, more violent episode took place: the 1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt, which almost caused a full-blown revolution and led to the deaths of several thousand peasants once the army intervened. As a consequence, the government introduced new legislation in 1907-08 to benefit the peasants, including a new law on agricultural contracts and a law establishing a rural credit bank (Casa RuralƒÉ) intended to facilitate purchases and leases, transferring property from large landowners to peasants. However, these laws (influenced by the poporanist trend of Constantin SterePsalidopoulos, Michalis. Economic Thought and Policy in Less Developed Europe, p.114. 2001, Routledge, .) were poorly enforced, a wholly inadequate amount of land was made available for purchase and the vast majority of the peasantry did not even qualify for most of the assistance made available.Sabates, p.9. 1921 reform The 1921 land reform was the second great distribution of land in Romanian history, the largest measure of its kind in Eastern Europe in its day.Gella, Aleksander. Development of Class Structure in Eastern Europe, p.51. 1989, SUNY Press, . On 23 March/5 April 1917, at the height of World War I, King Ferdinand promised there would be a substantial increase in the number of new property owners (as well as universal male suffrage). He undertook this commitment as a way of repaying the soldiers and their families for sacrifices made, but also sought to mobilise them to hold the front and avoid revolution-the announcement came just weeks after the February Revolution toppled Russia's tsar. The reform was preceded by a number of decisions adopted between 1917 and 1920. In order to give it a legal basis, the two chambers of Parliament decided to modify article 19 of the 1866 Constitution. The provision, which formerly declared \\"property of any nature\\" to be \\"sacred and inviolable\\" (and was adopted mainly to protect against new agrarian reformHitchins 1994, p.17.), had the following text added: \\"because of national necessity, the extension of rural peasant properties is advanced through the expropriation of arable lands, with the intent of selling them to the peasants\\".Stoica, p.286-7. On 20 March 1920 the rural law for Bessarabia was adopted; followed by similar provisions for Muntenia, Oltenia, Moldavia and Dobrudja on 17 July 1921, and on 30 July 1921 for Transylvania, Banat, Cri≈üana, Maramure≈ü and Bukovina.Stoica, p.287. One law was passed for each region owing to their very different socioeconomic structures, relations and specific contexts.Koehler, p.78. The PNR government of Alexandru Vaida-Voevod had a fully comprehensive land reform programme, but on 13 March 1920 the King dismissed this cabinet despite its backing by a substantial parliamentary majority, a clear sign that the Bucharest-based elite would try and govern the enlarged state by traditional methods;Gallagher, Tom. Modern Romania, p.30. 2005, NYU Press, . in 1922, Ion Mihalache of the P≈¢ (who as agriculture minister had drafted the first proposal) blasted the ensuing reform as a \\"kind of safety valve\\" whereby \\"the ruling class made only such concessions as were necessary to assure its own existence\\".Koehler, p.79. As adopted, the reform was a Liberal-Conservative bargain, decided upon in private by Ion BrƒÉtianu and Take Ionescu, who persuaded the former to abandon his intention of expropriating the soil.Rouƒçek, Joseph Slabey. Contemporary Roumania and Her Problems, p.300. 1932, Stanford University Press. Ultimately, all classes had come to see the futility and even danger of trying to preserve the old system. Many conservatives hoped efficiency and productivity would improve; liberals backed the measure on principle but also desired that agriculture served the needs of industry; and agrarianists dreamt of creating a peasant state on the basis of these changes. The threat of social upheaval from below and the need to maintain national solidarity in the face of irredentist neighbours also contributed to the enactment of reform.Hitchins 1994, p.349. The distribution of land to the peasants was achieved by expropriating the estates of foreign citizens, of absentee landowners (those who did not work their own land), arable land belonging to the Crown Domains and to Casa RuralƒÉ, land leased to tenants (arenda≈üi) for over five years, floodplains, etc. Expropriated parcels measured over 150, 300 or, in certain cases, 500 ha. The total area of expropriated land came to 5,804,837.83 ha (22,412.60 mi¬≤, of which some 3.7 million ha were arable), while 1,393,383 peasants received property (648,843 in the Old Kingdom, 310,583 in Transylvania, 357,016 in Bessarabia and 76,941 in Bukovina).Ministry of Agriculture and Domains, Statistical atlas ‚ÄúAgricultura √Æn Rom√¢nia‚Äù, p.75. Bucharest, 1938, 2003 reprint. Stoica cites a figure of 612,124 heads of household, or 30.53% of those eligible, who numbered 2,005,477. Hitchins 1994 p.353 has 30-35% of those eligible, or 2.3 million, receiving no land, mainly because there was not enough for everyone. Koehler p.79 notes that ‚Öî of the land went to farmers, with the remainder taken by the state or municipalities. The technical part of the reform- measuring the land subject to expropriation and parcelling it out to individuals-was very slow: by 1927 only about half the land from estates subject to the process had been measured, and of this, around 1,100,000 ha had been divided for distribution, which continued into the 1930s.Hitchins 1994, p.352. After the land reform, large landowners (mo≈üieri) owned 10.4% of the country's arable surface, compared to 47.7% before.Stoica, p.287.Verdery, p.45 asserts that just 8% of the surface remained in farms of over 10 ha, and landed property was limited to 100 ha. Hitchins 1994, p.351 puts the maximum at 500 ha, with arable land in holdings over 100 ha falling from about 25% in 1930 to 13% in 1941. Small holdings rose from 52.3% to 89.6% of total arable land.Hitchins 1994, p.353 charts a more modest rise of 48% to 62% holding 1-5 ha. Former owners received reimbursements in long-term bonds, and peasants were to repay 65% of the expropriation costs over 20 years.Sabates, p.9-10. In Transylvania, large landowners were almost exclusively Hungarian, while those to whom land was distributed were largely, though not exclusively, Romanian. Land reform was carried out with considerably less zeal in the Old Kingdom, where landlords as well as peasants were Romanian; in Transylvania (and Bessarabia, where many large estates were Russian-ownedBerend, Tibor Iv√°n. Decades of Crisis: Central and East Europe Before World War II, p.289. 2001, University of California Press, .), the new authorities saw reform as a means of increasing the titular nationality's dominance.Octavian Goga described land reform as \\"the most powerful means in the Romanization process of Transylvania\\", cited at Koehler 79-80. Small landowners of Hungarian descent also experienced unequal application of the reforms; some were expropriated ostensibly in order to build a church or a school.Koehler, p.80. The \\"Hungarian\\" churches (Roman Catholic, Reformed and Unitarian) were also weakened, losing some 85% of their lands, the income from which had supported their educational and charitable undertakings.Brubaker, Rogers, et al. Nationalist Politics and Everyday Ethnicity in a Transylvanian Town, p.70. 2006, Princeton University Press, . Hungarians and Saxons reacted loudly against the measures, their leaders persistently denouncing what they saw as shady and sometimes openly corrupt methods whereby land reform was used to modify the area's ethnic makeup.Koehler, p.81. (Notably, a reverse process had occurred from the end of the 19th century until World War I. The Hungarian government established a special fund to aid ethnic Hungarian farmers settle in Transylvanian districts with a significant non-Hungarian population, bringing in settlers from other regions if necessary and granting them privileges. This gave rise to a desire for retaliation among Transylvania's Romanians, achieved through the postwar agrarian reform.) In Bukovina, land reform was not markedly different from the Old Kingdom's; smallholdings grew by 28% and large estates were limited to 250 ha of arable land. However, large landowners were not required to give up their substantial forests, and arable land was scarce in relation to population density.Hitchins 1994, p.351. In Bessarabia, where Sfatul »öƒÉrii voted to unite with Romania on 27 March/9 April 1918, land reform (also viewed as a sine qua non by Romanians in Transylvania and Bukovina) was attached as a prerequisite for union because it was already underway there but only theoretical in Romania. However, after implementing its own reform, Sfatul »öƒÉrii proclaimed union without conditions on 27 November/10 December.Mitrasca, Marcel. Moldova: A Romanian Province Under Russian Rule, p.38-9. 2002, Algora Publishing, . The reform managed to subdivide private property into small pieces and create a certain equilibrium between former and new owners, leading to increased social stability, but the land's productivity did not experience substantial growth due to the rudimentary farming methods still employed. Average plots were 3.8 ha in size, less than the 5 ha needed for economic independence; the reform also suffered from corruption and protracted lawsuits. Ignorance, overpopulation, lack of farm implements and draft animals, too few rural credit institutions and excessive land fragmentation, exacerbated as the population grew, kept many peasants in poverty and yields inferior.Sabates, p.10. Fewer pasturelands and forests, necessary for economic viability, were expropriated: by 1927, just 23% of the country's natural pastures and meadows had been distributed as common pastures, while only 12% of forests were ever distributed. The 1930 census found that 6,700 landowners held 24% of the land while 2.5 million farmers had 28%. Right before World War II, 8% of landowners still had about half the land, and in 1938 the country had just 4,039 tractors, implying one machine per 2,490 ha. Irrigated land, fertilizers, chemicals, seed and breeding stock were in similarly dismal supply. 1945 reform The 1945 land reform was the first important political and economic act after the King Michael Coup of 23 August 1944, achieved by the new Petru Groza government on the basis of decree-law nr. 187/23 March 1945 for the realisation of land reform. The Romanian Communist Party (PCR) planned and applied the reform, also exploiting it for propaganda purposes in an attempt to form a popular base on the Soviet model (there too, collectivisation was preceded by land distribution). Its purpose, as the law's preamble declared, was to increase the size of arable surfaces of peasant holdings with less than 5 ha of land, to create new individual peasant holdings for landless agricultural labourers, to establish vegetable gardens at the outskirts of cities and industrial localities, and to reserve parcels for agricultural schools and experimental farms. Expropriation targeted land and farm property belonging to German citizens and Romanians who had collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II, land and farm property belonging to \\"war criminals\\" and to those \\"guilty of the national disaster\\", lands of those who sought refuge in countries with which Romania was at war or who fled abroad after 23 August 1944, and of those who in the preceding 7 years had failed to cultivate their own holdings, goods belonging to those who had voluntarily registered to fight against the Allies, property belonging to physical persons that exceeded 50 ha (arable land, orchards, hayfields, pastures, ponds, dam lakes, marshes and floodplains). With all large properties remaining after the 1921 reform eliminated, the aristocracy was deprived of its economic base and final remnants of power, as were the wealthy German and Hungarian churches (Reformed, Unitarian and Lutheran).Sabrina P. Ramet, \\"Church and State in Romania before and after 1989\\", in Carey, Henry F. Romania Since 1989: Politics, Economics, and Society, p.277. 2004, Lexington Books, . After the reform was announced, people who owned over 50 ha suffered the most, being subjected to intense pressure from the authorities and from Communist agitators, who from the end of 1944 had begun instigating peasants to occupy domains by force. Transylvanian Saxons and Banat Swabians were indiscriminately targeted, destroying many communities, but monastery, church and rural cooperative holdings, as well as those belonging to cultural and charitable organisations, escaped expropriation: the struggle for power was still ongoing and the Communists dared not alienate peasants, clergy and hostile intellectuals.Hitchins 1994, p.538. Although the law specified that individuals whose land was expropriated received no compensation, the beneficiaries of the distribution had to pay for the land, albeit at an advantageous price (the cost of one hectare was fixed at the annual average value of what one hectare produced; at the time the land was received, the peasant paid an advance of 10%, the rest being paid in the following 10‚Äì20 years). This fee was not burdensome but instead formed part of a government strategy to convince the peasants that their possession of the land was definitive; all mention of collectivisation was avoided. The reform increased the PCR's popularity among the peasantry, but the growth was slight and temporary, so that the party still resorted to fraud in rural areas during the 1946 election.Art√∫r Lakatos, \\"Land Reform in Romania, 1945. Motives and consequences\\", in Philobiblon, nr. 2/2014, pp. 467-68. According to an official communiqu√© from January 1947, of 1,443,911 ha (5,574.97 mi¬≤) expropriated from 143,219 owners, 1,057,674 ha were distributed to peasants, while 387,565 ha became state reserves. 726,129 families owning under 5 ha received land, the average lot measuring 1.3 ha. New data were released on 13 April 1948: 917,777 families had received a total of 1,109,562 ha of land (an average of 1.21 ha).Stoica, p.288. Completed in spring 1948, the reform did not significantly alter the structure of agriculture: holdings remained as fragmented as before, production of non-grain crops and animals declined, the co-operative movement was neglected, and the amount of land received by families was so small that their economic and social status hardly changed.Hitchins 1994, p.538-9. In any event, the peasants did not long enjoy their new properties, as collectivisation was launched in 1949. 1991 reform The February 1991 land reform, which followed the Romanian Revolution of 1989, sought to privatise land resources that were in state hands during the Communist period. The goal was to restitute land in state cooperatives to its pre-collectivisation owners, with families that did not own land at the time also receiving small allotments. Amidst an anti-Communist public mood of 1990-91, the restored interwar parties (PNL and PN≈¢CD) loudly called for restitution; initially, the governing ex-Communist National Salvation Front resisted the demand and sought to grant all rural residents 0.5 ha, but in a bid to capture the rural vote, it gave in to pressure to dismantle the collectives, although capping the size of restored properties to 10 ha. (The Front claimed this would promote social equity, with others claiming a political motivation: the recreation of a viable, propertied middle class in agriculture, one that could exert certain kinds of pressure on the state, was precluded.)Sabates, p.21-22.In 1997 and 2000, when the anti-Communist opposition held power, laws were passed increasing the restitution limit to 50 ha and allowing for up to 10 ha of forest land to be restituted. Sabates, p.18-19. In addition to righting a perceived historical injustice, the reform also pleased Romanian farmers, who have a long tradition of working their own land and are tied to it not only for subsistence needs but also out of sentiment (for instance because their ancestors retained it through fighting in wars). Given that many families still held legal title as evidence of their claim to the land, and retained a clear memory of where their plots were located (a memory kept alive during Communism), failure to restitute risked creating significant social unrest.Sabates, p.20-1. As well, given the relatively egalitarian land structure prevailing in 1949, historical justice (emphasised by the opposition) coincided with the social equity considerations that preoccupied the government.Sabates, p.19-20. Before the reform, 411 state farms and 3,776 cooperatives exploited almost all the country's arable land resources; in 1991, about 65% of this land-belonging to cooperatives-was restored to former owners or their heirs. About 3.7 million peasant households repossessed land, deciding to exploit it either individually or in associations. Peasants farms (the norm) were small, subsistence-based units of 2 to 3 ha each; family association farms covered 100 ha, and agricultural companies' farms were 500 ha in area. Reform of state farms, tangled in politics, was slower: in 1997, 60% of the area was taken up by peasant farms, 10% by family associations and 14% by agricultural companies, but state farms still accounted for 16%.Vald√©s, Alberto. Agricultural Support Policies in Transition Economies, p.49. 2000, World Bank Publications, . By 2004, however, privatisation was largely complete, with the private sector representing 97.3% of production value that year (97.4% of vegetable production and 98.9% of animal production); plans are in place to sell off the remainder of state- owned farmland. Out of 2,387,600 ha (9,218.58 mi¬≤) initially held by the state, 1,704,200 were returned based on Law 18/1991 and Law 1/2000; 574,600 were leased; and 108,800 were in the process of being leased at the end of 2004. \\"Agricultura\\", Permanent Representation of Romania to the European Union.

It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2006. The Wii version, entitled Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre, was released later in 2009. The game uses several story and plot elements from the original comic. This is the second game Rebellion Developments produced based on characters from the pages of 2000 AD; the first being Judge Dredd: Dredd Vs. Death in 2003. A remastered version of the game was released on 17 October 2017 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch, titled Rogue Trooper Redux.. Story The story is set on the planet Nu-Earth, which is caught in the gravitational forces of two suns and a black hole (used by Southers to warp into their space station high command), where a perpetual war between the Norts and Southers is being fought, in which millions have been killed. During the war all forms of chemical and biological weapons have been used, poisoning the planet, and the troops of both sides must live in enclosed cities and only venture into the outside if wearing protective gear known as a \\"bio-suit\\". The Southers have, through genetic engineering (done by the so-called \\"gene genies\\"), developed a race of warriors who are immune to the deadly atmosphere and will therefore be superior troops, the Genetic Infantry. All of the G.I.s were made immune to all toxins, diseases, and acids (except for one). The Souther High Command deploy their secret weapon in an airborne assault, but a traitor has betrayed the secret of the G.I.s to the Norts and they are massacred during the drop. This is known as the Quartz Zone Massacre. Rogue, apparently the only surviving G.I. (until he meets Venus Bluegenes), goes AWOL in order to track down the Traitor General responsible and avenge the rest of the G.I.s. Along the way he thwarts numerous Nort schemes, destroys some of Nort-land's highest personnel, such as Grand Admiral Hoffa and Sergeant- Kaptain Natashov. All G.I.s possess a biochip implanted inside of the skull that contains their personality traits, memories and consciousness. After a G.I. dies his biochip can be inserted in a slot in another G.I's equipment or weapon, enabling him to control it. The biochip can later be placed into a new body, allowing the fallen G.I. to be reborn. One quotation is \\"we're genetic infantry ‚Äì even when we're dead we don't escape from war.\\" Gameplay The game is a third-person shooter. Rogue's primary arsenal are his pistol and assault rifle, with the latter being upgradeable throughout the course of the game. The rifle may be outfitted with a silencer at any time, or deployed as a sentry turret. As the game progresses the player unlocks the ability to outfit the rifle with a sniper attachment, a shotgun attachment, a cluster mortar attachment, an anti-aircraft rocket launcher, and an electric beam rifle. Other weapons include deployable micro mines, incendiary grenades, scrambler grenades, fragmentation and sticky grenades plus heavy machine gun posts and flak cannons scattered across the field with occasional use of rocket launchers and hell cannons. Rogue's survival is ensured through clever use of the battlefield, which is generally rife with cover. He is able to fire while stationary, on the run, crouching, diving, and around the corner of any form of cover. Rogue also has the ability to unleash suppressive fire, which consumes a small amount of ammo and fires blindly from cover to intimidate enemies and cause them to find cover of their own. Enemies are highly susceptible to headshots, which will generally down them in a single strike. Another feature of gunplay is the ability to shoot an enemy soldier's air tank. Targeting the head displays a skull and crossbones, while targeting the gas tank shows a rectangular shape. Penetrating an air tank will cause enemies to run frantically and then explode, damaging any other enemies nearby. Rogue may search fallen enemy and ally bodies to recover Salvage, the game's main resource, and a necessity for purchasing any of Bagman's supplies. Salvage is used to create all forms of ammunition and grenades, med-kits and arsenal upgrades. Scrap piles may also be found and looted for a considerable amount of Salvage. Reception =Rogue Trooper= Rogue Trooper and Rogue Trooper: Quartz Zone Massacre received \\"average\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The Times gave it a score of four stars out of five and called it \\"a third-person shooter with smooth, detailed graphics, and a learning curve set so beautifully that even non-shooter fans should love it.\\" The A.V. Club gave it a B and said that it \\"doesn't approach the inventiveness of a great budget TPS like last year's Raze's Hell, but it's priced to move.\\" However, The Sydney Morning Herald gave it a score of three stars out of five and said, \\"Where Rogue Trooper rescues itself from mediocrity ... is in the way it utilises Gunnar, Helm and Bagman. They all perk up with humorous quips and helpful advice, while the futuristic gadgetry is inventive.\\" Detroit Free Press gave it two stars out of four and said it \\"feels more like basic training than hardcore warfare.\\" Computer Games Magazine gave the PC version two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, \\"Everything about Rogue Trooper screams 'competent,' which doesn't amount to memorable or particularly inspired.\\" Computer Gaming World gave it an unfavourable review and said, \\"If you take a game that‚Äôs composed entirely of canned set pieces‚Äîsay, Rogue Trooper‚Äîand play it over and over and over, you‚Äôre going to make yourself hate it. I liked it only mildly enough the first time. So it just goes to show that in a game this thin, familiarity breeds contempt.\\" Awards In 2006 the screenplay, written by Gordon Rennie, and the character Rogue were both nominated for BAFTAs. =Rogue Trooper Redux= The Redux edition received more mixed reviews than the original Rogue Trooper on all platforms according to Metacritic.

In the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, the castle was the key stronghold of the powerful House of Ostroh. Today it is in ruins.  Location  The castle itself is located in a relatively small elevated oval plaza. The area's natural geography helped to fortify the complex; the southern and eastern sides of the fortress raised upon a 20-meter high cliff, and the northern and western sides separate the city by series of trenches (moats) that replaced the big ravine.  History  The first wooden fortifications were built in the area before the 1241 Mongol invasion of Rus, during which they were subsequently destroyed. The ruins were later reconstructed by Knyaz Daniil from the Ostrogky family on the city's Sudovy Hill (castle hill). Since then, more additions and reconstructions were carried out, although the complex still retains its Medieval architecture. The castle complex consists of four main structures: the Guard Tower (Vezha murovana) where the castle's museum is located, the Bohoyavlenska Church, the New Tower, and the Belltower (constructed in 1905).

Her father, David, worked for the California Water and Telephone Co., which had drilled the well in 1903. He had recently testified before the state legislature for a proposed law that would require the cementing of all old wells. Within hours, a major rescue effort was underway with \\"drills, derricks, bulldozers, and trucks from a dozen towns, three giant cranes, and 50 floodlights from Hollywood studios.\\" At one point a rope was lowered to her but she could not maintain her hold on it and fell even further down the well.\\"Kathy Found Dead in Old Well; Body Located at 85-Foot Level.\\" Los Angeles Times, 11 Apr 1949. After digging down 100 feet, workers reached Kathy on Sunday (April 10) night. It was immediately apparent that Kathy was dead. It was impossible to move her because of the position of her legs. A rope was lowered from the top of the well and tied around her to gently pull her into a different posture from which Dr. Robert McCullock, one of the Fiscus family physicians, working from the lateral shaft, was able to free her. Contractor Bill Yancey brought her to the surface.\\"Kathy's Body Taken from Shaft: Doctor Asserts Life Apparently Ended Friday After Fall.\\" Los Angeles Times, 11 April 1949. Kathy's family was informed immediately. Over an hour later Dr. Paul Hanson made this statement to the more than 10,000 people who had gathered to watch the rescue: \\"Kathy is dead and apparently has been dead since she was last heard speaking on Friday. Her family has been notified and we are now notifying you. Dr. McCullock has pronounced Kathy dead and is assisting in the removal of the body. For the sake of the family who have held up so gallantly through this ordeal - and for all the people who have aided so magnificently, we ask you please to leave the scene of the accident as a courtesy to them. If this had been your child, we are sure you would not want a crowd remaining at the scene of the tragedy.\\" He then read a message from her family: \\"There is nothing we can say to fully thank the many people who have helped us so selflessly.

After the death of their parents, the three Poe children were split up: Henry lived with family in Baltimore, Maryland, while Edgar and Rosalie were cared for by two different families in Richmond, Virginia. Before the age of 20, Henry traveled around the globe by sea before returning to Baltimore and becoming a published poet and author. One of his works, \\"The Pirate\\", was a fictionalized account of his brother's first relationship with Sarah Elmira Royster in Richmond. Henry died of tuberculosis in 1831 at the age of twenty-four. Henry Poe was an inspiration to his brother's life and writings and the two had similar writing styles. Edgar Allan Poe for a time used the alias \\"Henri Le Rennet\\", a name inspired by Henry. Henry's influence on Edgar's writing include a character in the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket and possibly the name of the title character in the poem \\"Lenore\\".

New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 8. In one of his poems, Henry described her \\"long... last farewell\\" to them and was given a lock of her hair to remember her. After the death of Eliza, the three children were split up. Henry went back to his grandparents in Baltimore, Maryland while Edgar went to live with a foster family, the Allans of Richmond. Rosalie was adopted by the Mackenzies, also of Richmond.Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 7.

Henry kept in touch with his younger brother Edgar sporadically as they grew up, often through letters but once he even visited Edgar in Richmond in the 1820s. There, Edgar introduced his brother to his childhood sweetheart, Sarah Elmira Royster.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never- ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 30. Edgar's foster- father John Allan also corresponded with Henry. In one letter, dated November 1, 1824, Allan apologized that Edgar was slow in writing a letter to Henry, complaining that his foster-son \\"had little else to do, for he does nothing... The boy possesses not a Spark of affection for us, not a particle of gratitude for all my care and kindness towards him.\\"Meyers, Jeffrey. Edgar Allan Poe: His Life and Legacy. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1992: 19‚Äì20. Before the age of twenty, Henry served in South America and elsewhere on board the USS Macedonian.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 37. As a crewman aboard the Macedonian, a frigate, he also visited the West Indies, the Mediterranean, and Russia. In 1827, he returned to Baltimore to live with his grandmother, his aunt Maria Clemm, and his two cousins Henry Clemm and Virginia Clemm. Around this time, Henry was described as a \\"slim, feeble, young man with dark inexpressive eyes\\" who possessed a \\"singular personal beauty\\".Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 82‚Äì83. =Writings= In Baltimore, while working at a law office, Henry developed his interest in writing. He wrote verse inspired by Lord Byron into the albums of local young women and gave recitations.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 83. The May 19, 1827, issue of Baltimore's North American, or, Weekly Journal of Politics, Science, and Literature published Henry's \\"Dreams\\", a poem which laments the difference between the dream world and reality.Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 73. The October 27 issue of the same periodical published Henry's short story \\"The Pirate\\", a fictionalization of his brother's love affair with Royster. The main character was named Edgar Leonard, a combination of the names of the two brothers, who pursues a woman named Rosalie, a name borrowed from their sister. The Edgar Leonard character says: \\"I lost my parents at an early age... and was left to the care of a relation.\\"Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 84. One of Henry's poems, titled \\"Original\\", was virtually identical to one of Edgar's early poems published in Tamerlane and Other Poems, now known as \\"The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour\\". It is likely that this poem and another called \\"Dreams\\" were Edgar's and incorrectly credited to Henry.Poe, Harry Lee. Edgar Allan Poe: An Illustrated Companion to His Tell-Tale Stories. New York: Metro Books, 2008: 52. Edgar wrote \\"The Happiest Day, The Happiest Hour\\" while he was serving in the Army. He sent the poem to Henry, who had it published in the September 15, 1827, issue of the North American,Sova, Dawn B. Edgar Allan Poe: A to Z. New York: Checkmark Books, 2001: 103‚Äì104. which included Henry's name. Another poem published by Henry was \\"Lines on a Pocket Book\\", in which he considers John Allan's accusations that younger sister Rosalie Poe was illegitimate. Henry's poems generally have themes of melancholy, despair, and feature women who die and abandon their loved ones who dream of their reunion. Many are so similar to Poe's early work that they may have been collaborative efforts.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 85. His writing career ended in 1827 when the North American Review ceased publication. =Death= This stone marks the Poe family plot at Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, where David Poe, Sr. and William Henry Leonard Poe are buried.

New York: Farrar & Rinehart, Inc., 1934: 260 Influence Edgar Allan Poe was very close to his brother, as he wrote: \\"there can be no tie more strong than that of brother for brother ‚Äî it is not so much that they love one another as that they both love the same parent.\\"Kopley, Richard and Kevin J. Hayes. \\"Two verse masterworks: 'The Raven' and 'Ulalume'\\", The Cambridge Companion to Edgar Allan Poe. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002: 194. Edgar occasionally used the alias \\"Henri Le Rennet\\", a French version of his older brother's name. He was also inspired by his brother Henry's travels, often incorporating some of his stories from overseas into tellings of his own life story. The character of August Barnard in Edgar's novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838) seems to be inspired by Henry, especially in his travels across the sea and his drinking.Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 135. Poe may have also transformed his brother's name into the title character in his poem \\"Lenore\\".Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance.

Functionality Vector Architect was not a general-purpose vector graphics editor, but was specifically designed to create and edit XAML vector graphics for WPF and Silverlight applications. Vector Architect itself was based upon the WPF framework, using .NET Framework 3.5 to provide both its WYSIWYG front- end, and underlying editing engine. In many ways, Vector Architect was similar to Microsoft Expression Design, offering manipulation of native WPF objects, as opposed to performing conversion to XAML. Editing native objects is often necessary as XAML does not have exactly the same feature set as other popular vector image formats such as SVG and SWF, making the conversion process lossy in many cases. Although primarily focused on XAML, Vector Architect also supported the generation of PNG images with alpha channels, as well as the creation of icons containing alpha-blended images at multiple resolutions.
