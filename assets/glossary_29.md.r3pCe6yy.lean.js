Melville Castle lies to the north east. The Gaelic form is Leas Bhaid, meaning the \\"clump at the fort.\\" Lasswade lies within the Edinburgh Green Belt. Most of the population is retired or commutes to Edinburgh to work. There are, however, several local businesses, including horse riding stables (Edinburgh & Lasswade Riding Centre), golf driving ranges and golf courses (Kings Acre Golf Course and Melville Golf Centre), an alpine plant nursery (Kevock Garden Plants) a pub (The Laird and Dog) and a restaurant (The Paper Mill). There is also an athletics club, Lasswade Athletics Club, formed in 1981. Etymology and name The name Lasswade may be derived from the Brittonic *l√Ø:s meaning \\"a court, palace administrative centre\\", and w√Ø:Œ¥, \\"a wood\\" (c.f. Welsh llys gw≈∑dd). Also possible is an Old English derivation from the elements l«£swe, \\"pasture\\", and w√¶d, \\"a ford\\". Although the settlement may date back to the 8th century, the first written record of \\"Leswade\\" dates to 1150.Undiscovered Scotland : Lasswade On William Roy's map of 1750, it appears as Laswaid. Up until the late 18th century, all spelling was unfixed and was based upon the sound as perceived. History The old parish church was built in the 13th century, though little of it survives today. It was abandoned in 1793, and much of its ruins collapsed in 1866. The 17th-century Scottish poet William Drummond of Hawthornden was buried within its grounds. Sir John Lauder, 1st Baronet of Fountainhall was born at Melville Mill, Lasswade, in 1595; and the present 18th-century Barony House was known as Lasswade Cottage when Sir Walter Scott rented it (1798-1804). He was visited here by the writer James Hogg (the 'Ettrick Shepherd') and the Wordsworths. Thomas de Quincey, author of Confessions of an English Opium Eater, also lived in nearby Polton for some years, from 1843, in the cottage now known as de Quincey Cottage. The Scottish landscape artist William McTaggart moved to Lasswade in 1889, and many of his later works depict the Moorfoot Hills. Former 19th-century industries include paper mills, flour mills and a carpet factory. Created a police burgh in 1881, Lasswade merged with Bonnyrigg in 1929. It was a popular holiday resort in the 19th century for wealthy Edinburgh residents; yet, by the 1950s, much of the village's population had left for modern houses in Bonnyrigg. Groome (1885) noted as chief proprietors in the parish: Lieut.-Col. Gibsone of Pentland, Viscount Melville, Drummond of Hawthornden, Sir Geo. Clerk of Penicuik, and Mrs Durham of Polton. The estates along both banks of the Esk were: *left bank: Mavisbank House, Dryden Bank, Dryden, and Rosebank *right bank: Eldin (residence of John Clerk, F.R.S. (1736-1812), inventor of the naval tactic of breaking the enemy's line), Polton, Springfield, Glenesk, Hawthornden, Gorton, and Auchendinny (residence of Henry Mackenzie, the author of The Man of Feeling) Other notable buildings The current Lasswade Parish Church building was originally built in 1830 as a plain box chapelBuildings of Scotland: Lothian by Colin McWilliam for the former United Presbyterian Church (later United Free Church), it was remodelled by Hardy & Wight in 1894 and became part of the Church of Scotland in 1929. The parish has used this building since 1956, because of a structural fault in the Old Parish Church (subsequently demolished, built in 1793 from plans by John Clerk, Lord Eldin) discovered in the late 1940s. St Leonards Episcopal Church on Lower Broomieknowe dates from 1890 and is by Hippolyte Blanc. The former board school of 1875 stands with commanding views over the village on the northern slopes next to the Old Kirkyard. It is now converted to flats. Lasswade High School moved to its current premises in the west of Bonnyrigg in 1956, being rebuilt on the same site in 2013.Lasswade Centre (Lasswade High School, Gazetteer for Scotland  Parish  The parish of Lasswade is bounded on the north by the City of Edinburgh (namely the former parishes of Colinton and Liberton), on the east, by Dalkeith, Newbattle, Cockpen and Carrington, on the south by Penicuik and on the west by Glencorse.

A Parochial Board was established under the Poor Law (Scotland) Act 1845. Within the parish of Lasswade, police burghs were created at Bonnyrigg, 1865 (main part in the parish of Cockpen); Lasswade, 1881; and Loanhead, 1884. Police burghs were communities over a certain size who were entitled to police many of their own affairs, such as cleansing, street lighting and water supply as well as public order. Police burghs were run by elected commissioners or magistrates. In 1901, police burgh functions were taken over by town or burgh councils.Catalogue of Midlothian Burgh Council archives retrieved April 2016 With the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894 the Parish Council was established, but this only administered the ‚Äúlandward‚Äù part of the parish, i.e. the burghs were excluded.

He settled in London and appeared in various circuses, music halls and pantomimes. In 1912, he became one of the first acts to appear in the music hall's first ever Royal Command Performance.\\"Biography of Paul Cinquevalli\\" , Victoria and Albert Museum website, accessed 20 November 2012 Though he performed in a stylized costume consisting of a leotard and tights, he is generally regarded as one of the first gentleman jugglers, because he performed with everyday objects such as bottles, plates, glasses and umbrellas. One of the tricks he originated which is still performed today, was to throw a full bottle in the air, catch the neck of the bottle on the spike of an umbrella, and then open the umbrella as the liquid in the bottle ran out of it. He also incorporated feats of strength in his act. One of his trademark tricks was supporting a chair in his teeth while juggling three balls. On the chair sat an assistant reading a newspaper, and on the assistant's lap was a desk. When the First World War commenced in 1914, Cinquevalli was ostracised due to his German nationality and did not appear in England after 1912. He retired from the stage and died in Brixton, London in 1918. He was buried at West Norwood Cemetery. Literary references Cinquevalli's life and career is the subject of a poem by Edwin Morgan, the National Poet of Scotland from 2004‚Äì2010.

Billed as \\"Britain's Greatest Hero\\", it is known for being in the style of an anthology title and for its multi-linear plotlines. He first saw print in comics published by Paul Grist's Dancing Elephant Press, and is now published by Image Comics. Comics International began exclusive publication of a monthly four-page strip featuring the supporting character Ben Kulmer (the Claw); this started in #185 of the magazine and was set to run for twelve episodes. These strips have since been reprinted by Image Comics in a special. Publication history Grist created Jack Staff based on a story he had written to make use of Marvel's Union Jack character, only to be rejected. He reworked the story to make it more of an original, self-contained comic which Grist then published through his own imprint, Dancing Elephant Press. After twelve issues in black and white, Grist restarted the title with Image Comics, now with colour provided by Phil Elliott. Jack Staff comes out roughly three times a year. This ran for 20 issues, then was ended. It was restarted as the Weird World of Jack Staff that has had 6 issues. Nothing new has been done since 2011. What has made the character very popular is Grist's use of many popular characters from British comics, some taken wholesale, others inspired by them. (See Supporting cast in Jack Staff) A crossover was planned between this title and Invincible, with Grist drawing and Robert Kirkman writing, but their schedules have not yet allowed it. Jack Staff himself has already appeared in a cameo in an earlier issue of the title, at the memorial service for the slain Guardians of the Globe,Invincible #8 (January 2004) and later appeared helping to defend the Earth from an army of other-dimensional Invincible doubles during the globe-spanning Invincible #60. A crossover with Savage Dragon was also planned, in which Dragon would have visited Castletown as part of a storyline in which he searched the world for his missing wife.Savage Dragon #138-139 (September‚ÄìOctober 2008) Fictional character biography Jack Staff, Britain's Greatest Hero, has been active since at least World War II. While he has revealed he has been around since the Victorian Age and gained his powers there, it is unknown if he was active as a superhero or similar adventurer. In his civilian identity, he works as a builder by the name of John Smith and has done since the 19th century. During World War II, he was active with the Freedom Fighters, a group of American and British superheroes: Sgt. States, Blazing Glory, and Tommy Twister. During the war they defeated a vampire, Templar Richard, but not before Sgt. States also became a vampire (unknown to the rest of the team at the time). They also battled villains such as Kapitan Krieg and Brain Head. After the war, Jack continued as a superhero in the UK. By the 1960s, he was helping a group called Unit D fight several menaces. After working to stop a British weapon of mass destruction, the Hurricane, in the early 1980s, Jack quit being a superhero. It has only been recently that Jack has come back as a superhero, fighting alongside Q, Commander Hawkes of the now defunct Unit D, Tom Tom the Robot Man, Becky Burdock: Vampire Reporter, and others. Jack Staff was also an ally of the mysterious Mister Green, an entity working for/leading a cosmic force called \\"the Green\\", but severed his ties after the Hurricane incident. A slow-building subplot concerns an upcoming war, with \\"the Green\\" on one side and \\"the Red\\" on the other, and several of the comic's cast being recruited for it. Green has previously recruited Jack, and was recently revealed to have recruited Helen Morgan as well (and possibly more of Q through her) and taken Becky Burdock's old toy rabbit ‚Äî or perhaps, in so doing, chosen Becky herself ‚Äî to serve as a champion; a figure called the Man of Shadow is trying to recruit Becky. It's been hinted the Shadow and similar forces want to keep Becky & Jack apart. In The Weird World of Jack Staff #4, it was revealed Becky was indeed the prophesied champion who would save the world, and that Jack Staff's destined role was to keep her alive until then. It has been noted by various characters (such as in Jack Staff Special #1) that Jack's record of success is a bit iffy; he often gets battered by supervillains and ends up in embarrassing or dangerous situations, such as being set up to be arrested by the Spider. In the future visions shown in Weird World, in the final battle he will be battered by the adversary; when the seers Professor Fate and Morlan the Mystic watch this battle, Morlan notes that Jack is incapable of defeating such a foe \\"but he's going to try anyway\\" (#3). Powers and abilities Agile and acrobatic, the only clearly defined power of Jack Staff is his ability to move energy. This has been shown by his moving energy into his staff to break through solid walls, or move the anger from Hurricane. This ability is never clearly defined with regard to where the energy is moved from, or what kind of energy is involved. Jack appears to be either immortal or very long lived. He reveals that he has been around since the at least the Victorian era. He was active as Jack Staff during World War II up until the 1980s when he retired after the Hurricane incident. He looks no different today then he did during World War II. No further background on him has yet to be revealed, although in the twelfth issue of the second Image volume, there were hints of a connection with the \\"Eternal Warrior\\". He has had dreams of some future threat, most recently in Jack Staff Special #1 ‚Äî Becky Burdock is plagued by the same thing, though more frequently.

The first organised hurling and football club in New York was founded in 1857. Since then football in New York has grown. At one point there were close to 40 football clubs in the New York GAA league. However, since the migration back to Ireland with that country's increasing economic prosperity (the Celtic Tiger), the number of clubs dwindled down to 31. In the past two years, the NY GAA has brought in two new teams, one (Na Clairsigh) from Albany and another (Four Provinces) from Philadelphia. But with the Meath team dropping out of the league competition due to too few players and other teams combining together, participation has declined. However, the renovation of Gaelic Park and increased participation by underage teams are measures that have been taken to increase participation again without having to rely on players imported from Ireland.

In the following 30 years, the New York, Emmet, Wolfe Tone, Brooklyn, Geraldine and Men of Ireland clubs were set up. The Gaelic Athletic Association's successful North American tour had a notable effect on the growth of hurling in New York and North America in general by the end of the 19th century. At this time, the Keane Gaelic Hurling Trophy began to be awarded to the club which won the New York senior championship. New York's county team have had a number of notable hurling achievements, particularly the 1958 win over Wexford. In 1969, New York defeated Kilkenny over two legs in what was described as a \\"world championship cup\\". In the 2006 Ulster Senior Hurling Championship, New York scored a famous 1-18 to 1-12 win over Derry.

Ice sheet retreat initiated ca. 19,000 years ago and accelerated after ca. 15,000 years ago. The Holocene, starting with abrupt warming 11,700 years ago, resulted in rapid melting of the remaining ice sheets of North America and Europe. The retreat of glaciers altered landscapes in many ways and is currently still acting as a result of climate change. Geographical alterations= Antarctica  Fragments of Larsen B ice shelf lingered until 2005. Radiocarbon dating has been used to date the start of glacial retreat on Alexander island 18,000 years ago. The outermost locations like Marguerite Bay were fully deglaciated 12,000 years ago and the further inland locations continued deglaciating for an additional 3,000 years. The Larsen ice shelf was formed in the early Holocene at a latest estimation of 10,700 years ago. Certain segments of the ice shelf have collapsed as recently as 1995 for Larsen A and a large segment of Larsen B collapsed in 2002.  Europe  The many valleys of the Cairngorms, a mountainous region in the Eastern Scottish Highlands are littered with deposits from this period. In northwestern Iceland, the Icelandic ice sheet began its non-uniform retreat about 15,000 years ago. Surface exposure dating using the isotope 36Cl was the primary means of dating boulders and terminal moraines in the Drangaj√∂kull area in Iceland. Ages of erratic boulders found near the Leirufj√∂r√∞ur valley and moraine range from 7-12 thousand years old. The average ages for the groupings of boulders in the Leirufj√∂r√∞ur area is 9.3 thousand years ago. Directly south of Leirufj√∂r√∞ur in the Kaldalon Valley the average age of the boulders is 15,000 years old. The two different average ages are a result of different rates of glacial activity in Iceland.Modern glacial activity. Antarctica is not pictured. Another area that has experienced deglaciation during the Holocene is the Spitsbergen island within Svalbard archipelago in Norway. For the last 12,000 years exposed rockwalls have been eroding due to a mixture of biogenic flaking, frost shattering, and stress relaxation that results when glaciers retreat. One way the rate of rockwall retreat is measured is by examining the diameters of local lichen to establish an age of growth.  North America  The retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet in Canada led to the formation of moraines and up to 26 proglacial lakes scattered throughout central Canada. The deglaciation occurred from the last glacial maximum (21,000 years ago) until about 7000 years ago. Some of the lakes the southern Ungava Bay area were fully deglaciated c. 6,000 years ago. Meltwater from the glacial prehistoric Lake Agassiz contributed to the neoglaciation during the Holocene, which resulted in an uptick of glacial activity at least as far away as Iceland. The Nuup Kangerlua and Sermilik regions, in southwestern and southeastern Greenland respectively, are two localities that experienced deglaciation after the Holocene warming period started. Warming atmospheric temperatures as well as warming waters in the Labrador Sea accelerated the speed of deglaciation which started on the coasts of Greenland before heading inland. Moraines located in the interior of the Nuup Kangerlua area have been dated to 8.1 to 8.3 thousand years ago; they mark a local cooling that caused glaciers to re-advance and leave moraines behind. The modern Ohio River was formed when the river was temporarily dammed just southwest of Louisville, Kentucky, creating a large lake until the dam burst. The Ohio River largely supplanted the former Teays River drainage system, which was disrupted by the glaciers. Ancient Lake Chicago, on the southern margin of the Wisconsin Glacier, found successive lower outlets as the glacier retreated, until the Saint Lawrence River route was uncovered. Corresponding to each level, remnant lake shore features may be found in many areas. One prehistoric shoreline is delineated by Bluff Avenue, a north-south street on the La Grange, Illinois, east side. Changes in sea level during the Holocene. Current river delta positioning and sediment composition in northern Michigan were created by a glacial lake. The lake resulted from retreating glaciers.  South America  The Northern Patagonian Icefield is one of the locations that experienced a surge in glacial activity during the neoglaciation period. Terminal moraines formed 5.7 thousand years ago in the San Rafael Glacier and around 4.96 thousand years ago they formed in the nearby Colonia glacier. In the Southern Patagonian Icefield located in Argentina and Chile, some glaciers have actually been advancing to their peak extents as recently as the 19th century as evidenced by moraines. Another remnant of glacial activity in the southern Patagonian icefield is the creation of meltwater channels within the El Canal spillway found near the Lago del Toro in Chile. The different layers of stratification have been used to date different occurrences of glacial lakes in the region.  New Zealand  Within the last 30 years while most locations have experienced continue glacial retreat, glaciers located in the Southern Alps of New Zealand have advanced in position. Glaciers located near coasts such as those in New Zealand are especially responsive to climate change and serve as an indicator of local climate change. The anticipated warming waters near New Zealand in the Tasman Sea will lead to a reduction in glacial mass balance.Eight records of local temperature variability on multi-centennial scales throughout the course of the Holocene, and an average of these (thick dark line).

While the heterophoria refers to a fusion-free vergence state, the fixation disparity refers to a small misalignment of the visual axes when both eyes are open in an observer with normal fusion and binocular vision. The misalignment may be vertical, horizontal or both. The misalignment (a few minutes of arc) is much smaller than that of strabismus. While strabismus prevents binocular vision, fixation disparity keeps binocular vision, however it may reduce a patient's level of stereopsis. A patient may or may not have fixation disparity and a patient may have a different fixation disparity at distance than near. Observers with a fixation disparity are more likely to report eye strain in demanding visual tasks; therefore, tests of fixation disparity belong to the diagnostic tools used by eye care professionals: remediation includes vision therapy, prism eye glasses, or visual ergonomics at the workplace. Fig.1: Visual axes of the two eyes in optimal binocular vision (blue) and in exo and eso fixation disparity (black and red, respectively).  Optimal binocular vision  In Fig. 1, the blue lines and characters illustrate the situation of optimal binocular vision: the extra-ocular muscles adjust the vergence angle between the two visual axes so that the fixation target X is projected in each eye onto the centre of the fovea, i.e. the location on the retina with the highest spatial resolution. The fixation point is projected in the two eyes onto retinal points that correspond to the same visual direction in space so that single vision is provided. This means that the visual axes intersect at the fixation target X. On the level of the visual cortex there is a perfect spatial overlap, i.e. the binocular disparity is zero and best binocular summation is possible. Such an optimal state occurs only in a minority of observers.  Sub-optimal condition of fixation disparity (FD)  Most observers have a so-called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù binocular vision in the sense that they are able to view stereoscopically, but still many of these observers can have a sub-optimal condition in terms of a fixation disparity (FD). The vergence angle is slightly misadjusted so that the fixation point is projected slightly apart from the centre of the fovea. The visual axes may intersect in front (red lines) of the target plane, or behind (black line); these states of over- or under-convergence are referred to as eso- or exo FD, respectively (see Fig.1). In the visual cortex, a binocular disparity between the two retinal images remains. If this disparity is small enough, sensory and neural mechanisms in binocular neurons still attribute the same visual direction to these slightly disparate images and single vision is provided. This mechanism of sensory fusion with normal retinal correspondence operates within a certain limit of disparity, referred to as Panum‚Äôs area. If the disparity is larger, the normal Panum‚Äôs fusion mechanism is not sufficient; rather, in order to achieve fusion, a neural remapping of retinal correspondence can occur, which - however - prevents a high quality stereo vision. Thus, in order to achieve single vision, two physiological mechanisms operate hand in hand: 1.) The motor mechanism of the extra-ocular eye muscles adjusts the vergence angle as precisely as possible for the individual, but a small vergence error may remain. 2.) Sensory (neural) mechanisms provide single vision by means of fusion within normal Panum‚Äôs area or remapping of retinal correspondence (extended Panum‚Äôs areas).  Methods for measuring fixation disparity  The methods can be explained based on the study of Hofmann and Bielschowsky in 1900, who applied a modified Maddox wing: the right eye is presented with a horizontal scale and the left eye with an arrow. The observer perceives that the arrow points onto one of the numbers on the scale which indicates a possible vergence mis-adjustment. The Maddox wing, however, does not test binocular vision since no fusion target is present. For testing the state of binocular vision, Hofmann and Bielschowsky included an additional fusion stimulus to the two eyes and still found a perceived offset of scale and arrow; they referred to this offset as ‚ÄúDisparit√§tsrest‚Äù (in German), which means ‚Äúresidual disparity‚Äù. Later, Ogle coined the term \\"fixation disparity\\". More generally, this traditional vergence test is a subjective test in the sense that the observer reports his/her perception of the relative position of two test targets that are presented separately to the two eyes, i.e. dichoptic targets. This test relies on the assumption that retinal points are associated with visual directions in space. If physically aligned dichoptic targets appear subjectively aligned, they are projected onto corresponding retinal points and the visual axes intersect at the test target; thus, the vergence angle agrees with the viewing distance. In case of a deviating vergence state, the dichoptic targets need to have a certain physical horizontal offset in order to be perceived in line. These subjective measures agree with objective recordings with eye trackers, if no fusion stimulus is involved. For measuring subjective fixation disparity, researchers as Ogle, Sheedy and Saladin,Sheedy JE, Saladin JJ. Validity of diagnostic criteria and case analysis in binocular vision disorders.

The investigation of heterophoria at near and a new fixation disparity technique. Optician. 1974; 148: 547‚Äì551. WessonWesson M.D., Koening R.A., A new method for direct measurement of fixation disparity, Southern Journal of Optometry 1, 1983, pp. 48‚Äì52 constructed test instrumentation including fusion targets and dichoptic targets using cross- polarized filters in front of the eyes; some of these devices are commercially available. If the dichoptic targets are presented to the observer in physical alignment, the angular amount (in the unit minutes of arc) of subjective fixation disparity is indicated by the perceived misalignment of the two dichoptic targets. This can be compensated by the patient's individual amount of a prism eye glass (in the unit prism dioptre) so that the patient perceives alignment. The latter prism needed to reduce the fixation disparity to zero is referred to as aligning prism (earlier called associated phoria). Instrumentations as the Disparometer, the Mallett-unit, or the Wesson Card differ in the type of fusion target: some use small central fixation letters, others use more peripheral fusion targets. The instruments can be swung through 90¬∞ to measure any vertical fixation disparity. The test devices can also be used to detect suppression. The above studies of subjective fixation disparity assumed - partly implicitly - that the dichoptic targets would indicate the vergence misalignment of the visual axes muscles, i.e. the vergence error, as it can be measured with eye tracking methods. This seemed to be justified by the first objective recording of fixation disparity made in 1960 by Hebbard with an eye tracking method based on small mirrors fixed onto contact lenses: he found agreement between the two measures (in the one observer tested). However, subsequent studies found that the objective recordings with eye trackers can differ substantially from the subjective test results with dichoptic targets: with central fusion targets and closely adjacent dichoptic targets, the subjective measure can be about 10 times smaller than the objective measure. When the dichoptic targets are gradually shifted by some degree away from the fusion target, then the two measures become more and more similar. This was interpreted as a change in retinal correspondence in the sense that the visual direction associated with the dichoptic targets is modified in the vicinity of the fusion target. Fig. 2: Definition of the two types of fixation disparity  Definition of objective and subjective fixation disparity  Given the discrepancy between objective measures with eye trackers and subjective measures with dichoptic targets, different definitions should be applied (see Fig. 2): ¬∑ Objective fixation disparity (oFD) is defined as the oculomotor vergence error that can only be measured with eye trackers, i.e. oFD = V ‚Äì V0 . This is the difference between the vergence angle in binocular vision (V, red line in Fig. 2a) and the optimal vergence state when a target is projected in each eye onto the center of the foveola (V0=2 arc tan ((pd)/2)/D), blue line in Fig. 2a). V0 is estimated from the monocular calibration of the eye tracker, i.e. the left eye is covered when the right eye calibration is made and vice versa; this procedure assumes that in monocular vision a target is projected onto the centre of the foveola. ¬∑ Subjective fixation disparity (sFD) is defined as the angular amount of the offset between dichoptic targets that need to be adjusted to a certain offset d so that the observer perceives the dichoptic targets in alignment (see the pair of nonius lines in Fig. 2b). Note that this definition of sFD = arctan (d/D) does not refer to the current vergence angle. The resulting subjective fixation disparity may depend on the spatial arrangement of dichoptic targets and fusion targets. The discrepancy between oFD and sFD is shown in Fig. 2 in that the disparity ‚àÜ between the two visual axes is typically larger than angular amount of the nonius offset d.  Physiological properties of both types of fixation disparity  A fixation disparity is not constant within a certain observer, but can vary depending on the viewing conditions. If test prisms with increasing amount are placed in front of the observer‚Äôs eyes, the fixation disparity changes in the eso direction with base-in prisms and in the exo direction with base-out prisms (Fig. 3). These prisms force the eyes to change the vergence angle while the viewing distance remains unchanged. Prism-induced fixation disparity curves (prism FD-curves) can be characterized by the following parameters: * the y-intercept refers to the naturally occurring fixation disparity without a prism (FD0) * the x-intercept gives the amount of a prism (P0) that compensates a naturally occurring fixation disparity. This x-intercept is also referred to as aligning prism or ‚Äì in earlier times ‚Äì as associated phoria when the subjective nonius method was used (sP0) * the slope of the curve near zero prism load Fig. 3: Fixation disparity as a function of the forced vergence angle which is induced by base-in prisms and base-out prisms in front of the eyes. These prism FD-curves have widely been used for subjective fixation disparity and the clinical implications are described below. Only more recently, subjective and objective prism FD-curves have been measured simultaneously: In principle both measures have a similar form of these curves, but they can differ quantitatively; typically, oFD is much larger than sFD. A comparison of subjective versus objective measures revealed a significant correlation (about r = 0.5 ‚Äì 0.7) for the y-intercept (sFD0 versus oFD0), but not for the slope. In natural vision without prisms, the vergence state varies as a function of the viewing distance of the target: the subjective fixation disparity may shift towards more exo states from far- vision to near-vision. The effect of proximity is different for objective and subjective fixation disparity. During reading of text material, the objective fixation disparity can be measured with eye trackers in the moments of fixation. This reading fixation disparity has the following properties: * Fusion is maintained despite a fixation disparity during a reading fixation * The reading fixation disparity reaches a minimum at a certain moment in time during the fixation * The reading fixation disparity shifts to more eso conditions in the course of reading a line from left to right * Blurring the text makes the reading fixation disparity more exo * The reading fixation disparity is smaller when the text characters have a more pronounced periodic spatial structure  Clinical diagnostic criteria  Fixation disparity can differ considerably between observers with normal binocular vision. The following conditions of subjective fixation disparity tend to be more prevalent in observers with eye strain. Near-vision subjective fixation disparity (sFD0) tends to be larger in the exo direction and the aligning prisms (sP0) tends to be more base-in, suggesting that the eyes tend to under- converge. Most of these studies used the Mallett-unit, which consists of a small central fixation letter X surrounded by two letters O, one on each side of X. The prism FD-curve (measured subjectively in near vision) tends to have a steeper slope (see Fig. 3b), meaning that the binocular system is not able to reach a small fixation disparity when vergence is forced by prisms in the base-in and base-out direction. This evidence came predominantly from studies with the Disparometer, an instrument that allows presenting dichoptic nonius lines with different amounts of offset to find a particular physical offset that leads to perceived alignment. These nonius lines are presented within a circular contour of 1.5 deg diameter that is viewed binocularly. The proximity FD-curve (measured subjectively as a function of viewing distance) tends to be steeper, meaning that the binocular system is not able to keep the fixation disparity small, if a target is shifted closer in the range of about 100 to 20 cm. This evidence came from studies using a computer-controlled test stimulus including a central fusion stimulus. All the above measures in studies of eye strain refer to the subjective fixation disparity, because the procedure with dichoptic targets is technically easy and therefore can conveniently be applied in the clinical setting with some commercial test devices. Some of the cited studies found, that measures of subjective fixation disparity are a better diagnostic criterion for eye strain than the heterophoria, i.e. the vergence state without a fusion stimulus. The technically more complex eye tracking technology for measuring objective fixation disparity has not yet been investigated in relation to eye strain.  Remediation of fixation disparity in observers with eye strain  Given that an observer has a certain fixation disparity and suffers from eye strain, one may consider some of the following ways of remediation. Eye glasses with an included prism power is the optical method to reduce a fixation disparity. Different procedures have been proposed to determine the required amount of prism for the individual. Based on prism-FD curves (Fig. 3b), one can find the aligning prism sP0 that nullifies the naturally prevailing fixation disparity sFD0. This test procedure is typically made in near vision of 40 cm, e.g. with the Mallett- unit, the Disparometer, or the Wesson card (see above). Experimental evidence for the effectiveness of the aligning prism came from a study of reading speed and corresponding preferences of prism eye glasses. A different approach was suggested by H.-J. Haase who proposed a set of dichoptic target tests with both central and more peripheral fusion targets and additional stereo tests that were predominantly used in far vision. Such prisms alleviated eye strain and remained stable over time. The usefulness of prism eye glasses has been criticized since the initial fixation disparity may reappear again after some time due to the adaptability of the vergence system. One may consider, however, that vergence tends to be less adaptive in observers with eye strain so that in these observers the prisms may permanently reduce a naturally prevailing fixation disparity. Visual ergonomics of a computer workstation may take into account the individual proximity FD-curve: individuals with a larger exo fixation disparity at near may prefer a longer viewing distance where the fixation disparity is smaller. Visual vergence training (also referred to as orthoptic exercises or vision therapy) aims to improve the physiological condition of binocular vision with eye movement exercises, including e.g. frequent dynamic vergence changes between near and far vision. The effectiveness has been confirmed both in terms of alleviation of visual symptoms and in better physiological conditions, e.g. the prism-FD curves became more flat. The physiological effect of visual vergence training has also been confirmed for other vergence functions.

Known as Dorsey Road, the highway runs from the end of state maintenance in Hanover east to MD 648 in Glen Burnie. MD 176 is a mostly four-lane highway that parallels MD 100 and forms the southern portion of the Airport Loop, a circumferential highway around Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI Airport) that connects the airport with various airport- related services. The highway serves as the main connection between the Airport Loop and Interstate 97 (I-97). MD 176 was constructed in the late 1920s between Glen Burnie and Dorsey at the Anne Arundel-Howard county line. The state highway was extended west to U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Elkridge in the late 1930s concurrent with the construction of railroad grade separations at Dorsey and Harmans. MD 176 was widened over much of its length in the late 1940s and in Anne Arundel County in the 1970s and 1980s. MD 100 became the primary highway connecting Elkridge and Glen Burnie in the mid-1990s; MD 176 was subsequently truncated at Hanover. The portion of MD 176 west of MD 295 became an eastern extension of MD 103. Route description View west from the east end of MD 176 at MD 648 in Glen Burnie MD 176 begins at the west end of state maintenance adjacent to the cloverleaf interchange between MD 100 (Paul T. Pitcher Memorial Highway) with MD 295 (Baltimore-Washington Parkway) in Hanover. Dorsey Road continues north as a county highway through an industrial park. MD 176 heads east as a two-lane undivided road that crosses Piney Run. The highway meets the northern edge of MD 713 (Arundel Mills Boulevard) just north of the highway's interchange with MD 100 northeast of the Arundel Mills shopping mall. MD 176 continues east as a four-lane undivided highway between a residential area to the south and industrial parks to the north. The highway parallels its old alignment, part of which is MD 645, through the hamlet of Harmans. There, the highway crosses over Stoney Run and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, which also carries MARC's Penn Line. Just east of the railroad crossing, MD 176 intersects MD 170, which heads south as Telegraph Road and north as Aviation Boulevard. MD 176 continues east along the southern portion of the Airport Loop surrounding BWI Airport on the northern edge of Severn. The highway passes between the airport property to the north and a residential area on the south. MD 176 intersects MD 652 (Old Telegraph Road) and WB&A; Road and passes the Thomas A. Dixon Aircraft Observation Area. The route becomes a divided highway and reaches the eastern end of its portion of Airport Loop at its junction with MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard) at the southern edge of Ferndale. East of MD 162, MD 176 has an incomplete partial cloverleaf interchange with I-97. The missing movement, from southbound I-97 to MD 176, is handled via MD 162. The state highway becomes undivided just before reaching its eastern terminus at MD 648 (Baltimore-Annapolis Boulevard) in Glen Burnie. This intersection is adjacent to one of two southern ends of MTA Maryland's Baltimore Light RailLink; the terminal station, Cromwell / Glen Burnie station, is accessed via MD 648. The junction is also next to the northern end of the Baltimore & Annapolis Trail. The eastern leg of the intersection is 8th Avenue N.W. MD 176 is a part of the National Highway System as an intermodal connector between MD 162 and I-97. History Beginning of eastbound MD 176 in Hanover MD 176 was constructed as a concrete road from MD 3 (later US 301 and now MD 648) in Glen Burnie west to the B&O; Railroad crossing at Dorsey at the Anne Arundel-Howard county line in 1929. The connection between the railroad crossing and US 1--the highway intersected US 1 just south of the modern US 1-MD 100 interchange--remained a county highway until 1936. Work on MD 176's grade separations of the B&O; Railroad and Pennsylvania Railroad at Dorsey and Harmans, respectively, were underway by 1936. MD 176's overpass of the Pennsylvania Railroad was finished in 1936 and its underpass of the B&O; Railroad was complete by 1938. The old alignment of MD 176 at Harmans became MD 645. MD 176 has also had two other railroad crossings. The highway crossed over the Washington, Baltimore and Annapolis Electric Railway on a \\"weak and narrow wooden bridge\\" until 1944, when the bridge over the abandoned railroad was removed and the railroad embankment was filled. By 1951, MD 176 had an underpass of the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad immediately to the west of US 301 that has since been removed. MD 176 was widened and resurfaced over its whole length between 1947 and 1950. The highway was expanded to a width of from Dorsey to Harmans and to from Harmans to Glen Burnie. The MD 295-MD 176 interchange was built as a diamond interchange between 1950 and 1953; a loop ramp from eastbound MD 176 to northbound MD 295 was added in 1956. The highway's interchange with the Glen Burnie Bypass, which started as US 301, became MD 3, and is now I-97, was constructed as a diamond interchange between 1954 and 1956. MD 176 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with MD 3 (now I-97) by 1978. The remainder of MD 176 from the west end of the divided highway to just east of MD 295 was expanded to four lanes in the late 1980s, with the bridge of Piney Run between MD 295 and MD 713 rebuilt in 1987 and the railroad overpass at Harmans rebuilt in 1989. MD 176 was superseded by MD 100 in the early to mid-1990s. MD 176 was expanded to a divided highway on either side of its interchange with MD 295, which was rebuilt as a cloverleaf interchange, in 1992 and 1993. By the latter year, MD 100 was under construction from US 1 to I-97. MD 100 was completed in 1995; the freeway took over as the east-west highway through the MD 295 interchange. MD 176 was temporarily assigned to Wright Road, Race Road, and Faulkner Road to connect the portions of the highway on either side of the interchange. Also in 1995, the highway was relocated to the current double-curve roadway to the US 1-MD 103 intersection. MD 103 was extended over that relocation east to its present eastern terminus and MD 176 was truncated at its present western terminus by 1997. The portion of this detour on Wright Road over MD 295 was retained in the state system and designated MD 176B. The highway's interchange with I-97 was reconstructed to its present form by 1999.

It was until 2015 a system of for-profit colleges in the United States and the Canadian province of Ontario, owned and operated by Corinthian Colleges, Inc. In 2015, Corinthian ceased operating and filed for bankruptcy. While most Corinthian-owned colleges were closed in early 2015, Educational Credit Management Corporation (ECMC), a non-profit, took ownership of more than half of Corinthian Colleges' campuses, including many Everest College campuses. As of 2016, 19 ECMC-owned Everest locations remain in operation. At least 10 more campuses were closed or in the process of closing in 2016. The Canadian branches were not purchased by ECMC and remain closed. Following significant downsizing, Everest graduates still express concerns that their degrees are worthless. In 2016, Corinthian Colleges was compelled to pay more than $1.1 billion to the State of California, in part for defrauding thousands of students. The judge ordered restitution of $820 million for students and civil penalties of $350 million. According to the California State Attorney General \\"For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people‚Äînow they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: There is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct.\\" More than a thousand former Everest College students have been afforded debt relief by the US government because of Everest's questionable business practices. Thousands more may get debt relief. History In 2007, Corinthian Colleges consolidated a number of schools under the Everest brand name. Former schools that became Everest Colleges include: Bryman College, Ashmead College, Mountain West College, Olympia College, Kee Business College, Parks College, Western Business College, Blair College and Springfield College.

The diplomas issued by Everest College were described as worthless as many graduated students found no job placement, the reputation tainted. The Ontario government stepped in and shut down 14 Everest College of Business, Health Care and Technology campus locations owned by Corinthian Colleges on February 19, 2015. The next day, Everest College in Ontario, Canada declared bankruptcy. In February 2015, Educational Credit Management Corporation's subsidiary Zenith Education Group acquired 56 Everest College and WyoTech campuses from Corinthian. Zenith planned to transition the schools from for-profit to nonprofit status. It also planned to eliminate some programs with poor completion and job placement rates. Campuses with little to no revenue along with the 15 Everest campuses in California, which were not acquired by ECMC, closed their doors for good when Corinthian Colleges shuttered all of their remaining campuses on April 27, 2015. In March 2016, the US Department of Education fired Everest College's monitor, Hogan Marren Babbo & Rose Ltd., implicating several conflicts of interest. The State of California was also awarded $1.1 billion from Corinthian Colleges for false advertising and predatory business practices. The judge ordered restitution of $820 million for students. A 2016 Associated Press investigation alleged that Everest still recruits through telemarketing, has yet to make significant changes to its shoddy curriculum. Recent graduates also reported being unable to find work that would allow them to pay their student loans. Funding Approximately 96% of Everest's funds come from the US government. In 2016, ECMC, Everest's parent company, provided an infusion of capital to keep the schools running. Accreditation Accreditation for Everest College varies by country, state and region. Everest College campuses that are regionally accredited are Everest College Phoenix, Everest College Mesa and online courses taught through Everest College Phoenix. All other Everest College campuses are nationally accredited. Generally, credits from nationally accredited institutions are not transferable to other colleges and universities.Tussling Over Transfer of Credit, Inside Higher Ed, February 26, 2007 by Doug Lederman In 2009 Everest College Phoenix was placed on academic probation by its accrediting body over concerns that it did not have enough autonomy and control over on-campus academics and operations from the parent company, Corinthian Colleges, Inc. In September 2010, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools rejected a recommendation from its evaluation panel that the school's accreditation be revoked outright. In November 2010 the Higher Learning Commission voted to place the campus on a \\"Show-Cause\\" status which will require the College to demonstrate to the commission why its accreditation should not be revoked. Everest College Phoenix had until March 2011 to respond to the request and the matter was not expected to be resolved until November 2011. The College remained an accredited institution during this period.\\"Credentials of Everest College in jeopardy,\\" The Arizona Republic, November 17, 2010.

Legal proceedings= In the United States  Everest was one of 15 for-profit colleges cited by the Government Accountability Office for deceptive or questionable statements that were made to undercover investigators posing as applicants. Two unnamed campuses were cited in this report. Department of Education statistics indicated that Everest College graduates had the highest default rate of any school in California for students entering repayment in 2010 and the fifth highest rate in Arizona. In September 2010, a group of Everest College graduates sued the school for fraud, alleging deceptive recruitment practices concerning costs of attendance, the value of the degree, and whether credits earned there would transfer to other schools. In 2012, Everest College in Hayward, California was issued a \\"Notice to Comply\\" by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education for multiple violations, including engaging in \\"prohibited business practices.\\"Notice to Comply, California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, 2012  In Canada  In 2014, Everest announced the sale of all 14 locations in Canada after a probe by the parent company over concerns of falsified job placement and grades. In February 2015, Canada's National Association of Career Colleges announced that Everest College's Ontario locations had their operating license suspended by Ministry of Training, Colleges and Universities (Ontario). On February 19, 2015, Ontario's superintendent of private career colleges, the independent regulator that governs schools like Everest and others in the province, said it has suspended the chain's licence to operate in Ontario as a private college, effective immediately. Former students and teachers claim the college was corrupt and a scam. On February 20, 2015, Everest College Canada filed for Bankruptcy protection. Former campuses United States campuses were formerly found in the states of Arizona (2 campuses), California (15), Colorado (2), Georgia (4), Indiana (1), Illinois (5), Missouri (2), Nevada (1), Oregon (1), Texas (3), Utah (1), Virginia (3), and Washington (5). Everest College of Business, Health Care and Technology formerly operated 16 campus locations in Ontario. Two more campuses (Pittsburgh, PA and Aurora, CO) were closed in 2016.  Corinthian debt cancellation  On June 8, 2015, the Department of Education announced that it was developing a process that would allow former students of Everest (along with other Corinthian schools) to apply for debt relief, if they believed they were victims of fraud. While the Department has still not created a formal process, they have provided the outlines of what borrowers should submit if they wish to pursue debt cancellation on the Federal Student Aid website. In addition, the advocacy group the Debt Collective has created its own, unofficial \\"Defense to Repayment App\\" that allows former students of Corinthian and other schools accused of fraud to pursue debt cancellation. The applications generated through the Debt Collective's online form was cited by the Department of Education in a Federal Register notice, which said that \\"a need for a clearer process for potential claimants\\" arose due to the submission of over 1000 defense to repayment claims by \\"a building debt activism movement\\".

Early life Nadia was born to Mario Lopez Hern√°ndez and Aurora Ayuso Rodriguez. She has an older brother named Mario Josu√® Lopez Ayuso. Since childhood, Nadia embraced singing, but she kept her desire to perform hidden as her father did not embrace this idea. However, with the help of her mother, she participated in singing competitions such as \\"Fanta-sia Musical.\\" Nadia soon won the support and help of her father and began to secure musical gigs. At 14, she was a presenter and singer in the television program \\"Panorama Musical\\" and presenter on \\"La Guelaguetza.\\" While working in a restaurant, she sang with her father's mariachi group. Nadia's role in La Academia Nadia won first prize in the V International Talent and Modeling Convention in 1998. She recorded CDs in Oaxaca, most notably \\"Enamorada de t√≠\\", released in 1998. In 2002, Nadia landed a spot on the Mexican reality show La Academia on Televisi√≥n Azteca. With her rendition of \\"Cucurrucucu Paloma\\", she made the final 14 contestants on June 30, 2002. Nadia gave over a dozen performances on the show, including songs by Roc√≠o D√∫rcal, Chayanne, Juan Gabriel, Marisela, and Selena. Although she was voted off in fifth place, her performances garnered her a contract with Warner Music to record her first CD. In February 2003, Nadia's first album, called \\"Nadia\\", was released, featuring tracks \\"La differencia\\" (\\"The difference\\"), \\"La duda\\" (\\"The doubt\\"), and \\"Te voy a olvidar\\" (\\"I'm going to forget you\\").

It was the 93rd short in the Mickey Mouse film series, and the fourth for that year. The cartoon stars Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, and Goofy on a moose hunting expedition. It was directed by Ben Sharpsteen and features music by Paul J. Smith. The voice cast includes Walt Disney as Mickey, Clarence Nash as Donald, and Pinto Colvig as Goofy. This cartoon was released on the same year as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937). Plot The short begins with a female moose (with blond curly hair and antlers oddly enough) wading through a lake. Other odd things that make this moose strange is that she sounds her mating call with a horn and her legs are strangely familiar. The legs' owners are Donald and Goofy, disguised in a moose costume. Following them is Mickey, sounding his own moose call while being disguised as a shrub on stilts. Goofy's call is answered by an actual moose, causing him and Donald to excitedly shout \\"A moose!\\". Mickey tells them to \\"do their stuff\\" so he can shoot the moose with his shotgun. So, the duo go off to track down a moose. We go back to Mickey, who is searching for a moose. He stands over a bush and sounds his call, which is answered by a large red bull moose who was hiding in the bush. This understandably freaks Mickey out, who drops his shotgun, which fires and breaks, briefly scaring the moose. The antlered beast, now hungry decides to eat Mickey's disguise and takes a bite. The mouse, not wanting to risk being caught, takes a few steps back, but the bull follows and takes another bite, this time taking Mickey's shorts along with a mouthful of leaves. Of course, the mouse takes his shorts back. Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy have tracked down their quarry, a large black bull moose. Watching the male eat a bush full of leaves in one bite causes an jubilant Donald to add some makeup and lipstick to make the costume more attractive. Goofy adds in some \\"deer kiss\\" perfume to the disguise and himself and sprays a trail towards the bull, letting the wind do the rest. The moose, entranced by the scent follows it to the waiting \\"lady moose\\". A mere glance is all it takes for the rutting bull to become smitten, especially when \\"she\\" does a teasing walk for him. When the costumed cow moose gives a \\"yoo- hoo\\", the bull moose gives a howling response, blowing off the costume. Goofy (who still has the moose head on) quickly comes up with a plan and fan dances until he and Donald can get the costume back on, which makes the lovestruck male even more smitten with the costume. Once again disguised, the pair seductively dance with the aroused bull, succeeding in getting him to follow them; unfortunately, the Donald half falls off a cliff and lands on an angry bee. The insect follows the duck into the costume, making the pair dance to the tune of \\"La Cucuracha\\". The moose, angling for a kiss, kisses Goofy on the face, as Donald tries to hit the bee, causing the moose head to fly off of Goofy, luckily landing on him just before they could be caught. They lure the ecstatic moose to Mickey so he can do the rest. However, they don't know their leading the moose right towards another. Unfortunately for the mouse, his cover has been eaten off and the moose he has been dealing with is not amused. As the moose prepares to charge at Mickey, he hears a flirty \\"yoo-hoo\\", which catches his attention. Turning around, the rutting moose sees an attractive cow moose trotting towards him. Smitten with the \\"female\\", the aroused bull trots over to the costumed moose as \\"she\\" unknowingly backs up into him. While the horny male licks the costume's face and cozies up to \\"her\\"(despite a disguised Goofy trying to smack the antlered beast off of him), Donald tries to move the costume... only to realise he's under the moose trying to woo the \\"hot blonde\\". Before the red moose tries any more moves with what appears to be an attractive cow moose under him, the jealous black moose challenges him for the \\"lady moose's\\" hand, which he angrily responds to in kind. In an April Fools' Day prank, two bulls prepare to fight; Donald and Goofy race up a tree . The moose sharpen their antlers, clash and the earthshaking body slams cause Goofy and Donald, hanging on to the tree for dear life, fall between the two bulls. The antlered beasts forget about the whole costume incident, Donald and Goofy run for their lives while the angry moose chase them. Mickey soon joins them as they run for their lives, going on a boat and racing away, concluding the cartoon.

People can often make better predictions or choices with less information: more information is not always better. An example of information bias is believing that the more information that can be acquired to make a decision, the better, even if that extra information is irrelevant for the decision. Example In an experiment , subjects considered this diagnostic problem involving fictitious diseases: A female patient is presenting symptoms and a history which both suggest a diagnosis of globoma, with about 80% probability. If it isn't globoma, it's either popitis or flapemia. Each disease has its own treatment which is ineffective against the other two diseases. A test called the ET scan would certainly yield a positive result if the patient had popitis, and a negative result if she has flapemia. If the patient has globoma, a positive and negative result are equally likely. If the ET scan was the only test you could do, should you do it? Why or why not? Many subjects answered that they would conduct the ET scan even if it were costly, and even if it were the only test that could be done. However, the test in question does not affect the course of action as to what treatment should be done. Because the probability of globoma is so high with a probability of 80%, the patient would be treated for globoma no matter what the test says. Globoma is the most probable disease before or after the ET scan. In this example, we can calculate the value of the ET scan. Out of 100 patients, a total of 80 people will have globoma regardless of whether the ET scan is positive or negative. Since it is equally likely for a patient with globoma to have a positive or negative ET scan result, 40 people will have a positive ET scan and 40 people will have a negative ET scan, which totals to 80 people having globoma. This means that a total of 20 people will have either popitis or flapemia regardless of the result of the ET scan. The number of patients with globoma will always be greater than the number of patients with popitis or flapemia in either case of a positive or negative ET scan so the ET scan is useless in determining what disease to treat. The ET scan will indicate that globoma should be treated regardless of the result.

Its enrollment is 1,598, and it is operated by Mesa County Valley School District No. 51. In August 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama led a televised town hall meeting on healthcare reform at Central High School. Curriculum Central High offers a wide variety of classes, from basic computing to Advanced Placement Statistics and Calculus. To graduate, a student must have 25 credits, obtained by completing classes. The schedule is divided into four \\"block\\" classes in the day and four quarters in the year. It is possible to earn 0.5 credit per quarter per block. Set up this way, a student could earn 8 credits during one school year and 32 credits during four years of high school. This allows for students to retake failed classes and improve their grades without delaying their graduation. The exception to the 8 credits per year is if a student takes an after school course or is involved in a zero hour class. Zero hour classes take place 90 minutes (one standard block class length) before school and count for the standard amount of credits. After school courses include marching band and jazz band. These also count for the regular 0.5 credit per class earning. However, after school classes tend to entail activities outside of school (perhaps performing in a parade, competition, or other such activity). These activities are considered extracurricular and do not count towards school credits. The school has also partnered with Colorado Mesa University to offer college level courses for students who are excelling at the high school level. Extracurriculars Central High offers many extracurricular organizations, sports, and clubs, including Football, Baseball, Tennis, Soccer, Chess club, Marching band, Knowledge Bowl, and Performing Arts. The school competes in activities including Speech and Debate, Knowledge Bowl, and JROTC, as well as various sports. The school also hosts the local JROTC classes. Students from around the Grand Valley are welcome to participate and can arrange their schedules through the district accordingly. Central publishes a school newspaper titled The Warrior, which highlights school issues.

The gun was successfully employed in the late stages of World War II, and remained in service into the 1950s, being replaced in Soviet service by the T-12 antitank gun and the 85 mm antitank gun D-48 in 1955. The BS-3 was also sold to a number of other countries and in some of these countries the gun is still in service. A number of BS-3 pieces are still stored in Russian Ground Forces arsenals.

History BS-3 at the Israel Defense Forces History Museum The BS-3 was based on the B-34 naval gun. The development team was led by V. G. Grabin. The gun was employed by light artillery brigades of tank armies (20 pieces along with 48 ZiS-3) and by corps artillery. In the Second World War the BS-3 was successfully used as a powerful anti-tank gun. It was capable of defeating any contemporary tank at long range, excluding the Tiger Ausf B: to destroy that heavy tank the gun needed to shoot at less than 1600 m from the target. The gun was capable of defeating the glacis of Tiger II at a range of 500-600 metres and its Turret at 1500 meters. The gun was also used as a field gun. Though in this role it was less powerful than the 122 mm A-19, as it fired a smaller round, the BS-3 was more mobile and had a higher rate of fire.

The system is operated through articulated buses which move in dedicated lanes. Approximately 97% of the city's spatial perimeter will be covered by this system, involving nearly 243 kilometers. The MIO will cover approximately 72% of Cali's public transportation needs. MIO description. The project was set in motion by an investment of US$405 million; with 70% contributed by the Colombian government and the remaining 30% by the municipality of Cali. These resources are destined to finance MIO's infrastructure: construction of trunks, fueling stations, rest stops, the system of stations, pedestrian bridges, terminals, and yards. The articulated buses have a capacity of 160 passengers and circulate exclusively on the trunks; in turn, the register type buses will transport between 80 and 100 people and they will travel through tramways and special diversions.

They were built by Vickers, Barrow-in-Furness. The first three were designed by John Philip Holland. The Hollands were built under licence from the Holland Torpedo Boat Company/Electric Boat Company during the years 1901 to 1903. The Admiralty of the Royal Navy hoped to keep the Holland class a secret, and very few senior officers even knew of their existence. This led to the myth of the Admiralty not taking any interest in submarines. On the contrary, the Admiralty was well aware of the submarine's destructive potential. It therefore refrained from any submarine development program so as to avoid provoking similar programs on the part of foreign navies. Once those navies did begin serious submarine programs, the Admiralty had no choice but to begin its own.Galantin, Ignatius J., Admiral, USN (Ret.). Foreword to Submariner by Johnnie Coote, p. 1. Adoption of the submarine Captain Henry Jackson, British naval attach√© in Paris, had been instructed to report on submarine developments which had been underway in France for several years. In 1898 he witnessed trials of the privately developed , a small 11-ton submersible designed to be carried on board a warship. In January 1899 he informed the Admiralty of exercises with the 270-ton experimental submarine which had been used to launch a torpedo attack on the battleship . The Board of Admiralty considered whether it needed to act, but rejected further reports that the French had ordered up to a dozen submarines in the light of other reports on the trial suggesting that its outcome had been stage-managed for political reasons.Lambert pp. 41-42. In January 1900, the Washington attach√© Captain Charles Ottley reported that the US government was considering purchasing a submarine-boat designed by John Holland and provided the Admiralty with US Navy reports on the boat's performance and a set of blueprints. In February the new Paris attach√© submitted further favourable reports on the capabilities of Gustave Z√©d√©. Meanwhile, Admiral Fisher commanding the Mediterranean Fleet, which might be required to fight the French, asked the Admiralty for instructions on the best defence against submarines and suggested the use of defensive mines. In May the Admiralty responded by instructing the torpedo school to investigate means of combatting submarines, whereupon they requested a submarine with which to experiment, while in the same month news arrived confirming the US purchase of a Holland boat, . First Sea Lord Walter Kerr and the Controller, Rear Admiral Arthur Knyvet-Wilson, were convinced of the need to obtain a submarine for the Royal Navy to investigate its capabilities and means to combat submarine attack.Lambert pp. 43-44. No British shipbuilder had experience of constructing submarines, so the Admiralty began negotiations with the Holland Torpedo Boat Company and Vickers Ltd, which was a major shipbuilder for the Admiralty. It was agreed that The Electric Boat Company (having purchased the rights from Holland) would license Vickers to build submarines in Britain, and an order was placed for five. The Board of Admiralty now considered that the submarines might also be useful in an offensive role, not merely to practice defence, and if trials of the boats were successful further orders would be placed with Vickers.Lambert pp. 45-46. A general election in November 1900 led to a change of First Lord of the Admiralty from George Goschen to the Earl of Selborne. The new Parliamentary Secretary to the board was Hugh Oakley Arnold-Forster, who as a backbench Member of Parliament had criticised Goschen for failing to adopt submarines. Now he discovered that the Admiralty had been doing so in secret. Selborne became concerned that even so the Admiralty was lagging some way behind the French in development, and the first boat, whose contract was finally signed December 1900, would not be delivered until October 1901. Arnold-Forster proposed involving other companies in constructing submarines, but this was opposed by the Second Sea Lord, Vice Admiral Archibald Douglass, as well as by Wilson, on the grounds that it remained unwise to encourage the general development of the submarine, which might be of more benefit to smaller navies rather than the RN. Wilson considered that the limited range of existing submarines meant they would only be able to operate in French waters, whereas if further developed could become a weapon to threaten British home ports. He recognised the potential of the submarine to prevent maritime trade, which was essential to the survival of an island nation like Britain. Any steps possible to slow down submarine development should be taken while the navy worked on means of defence against the submarine.Lambert pp. 46-48. In the event, the story that Vickers was building submarines was leaked by a Glasgow newspaper in February, and confirmed by the Admiralty in March. Arnold Forster continued to press for more submarines to be built, considering that the navy either needed a great many or none, but although Selborne was inclined to agree, the two were opposed by the Sea Lords. It was agreed that only three per year would be ordered, which was the minimum number needed for Vickers to continue their specialist construction team. It was known that the French design was technically superior to the Holland boats ordered, but the Admiralty had no better design available at that time.Lambert pp. 49-50. Further development Construction of the boats took longer than anticipated, with the first only ready for a diving trial at sea on 6 April 1902. Although the design had been purchased entire from the US company, the actual design used, Fulton, was an untested improved version of the original Holland design using a new 180 hp petrol engine.Lambert p. 51. The Admiralty decided to appoint an Inspecting Captain of Submarines to oversee development work, and Captain Reginald Bacon was appointed in May 1901. Bacon was a technically minded officer experienced with the use of surface torpedo boats. His first recommendations were to note that the Holland submarines were likely to compare poorly to the current French design and would be unable to operate on the surface in anything other than fair weather (the boats had a range of only underwater). He therefore suggested the designs of boats four and five, which had not yet been started, should be modified to improve their seaworthiness. The Admiralty felt the Holland company would refuse any responsibility for difficulties arising from unauthorised design changes, but agreed to order one submarine of a new design, the . Experiments were conducted in 1901 at the torpedo school attempting to blow up a torpedo with underwater charges. In November 1902 Holland 1 finally became available for testing and was used as target with live explosive charges. It was found that the boat came to no harm from a guncotton charge exploded at a distance of . Since there was no known way of locating a submarine even to this accuracy, it was concluded that it was effectively impossible to attack submerged submarines. Destroyers were more at risk themselves from their own experimental charges thrown off the stern but in any case were not big enough to carry more than two charges. However, Bacon was much more optimistic over the offensive capabilities of the submarine, concluding that a group of 3‚Äì5 would be an insurmountable obstacle for any enemy ships attempting to operate near a port where the submarines were based.Lambert pp. 52-53. Service The submarines initially had serious reliability problems, and a 1903 attempt to sail around the Isle of Wight on the surface resulted in four of the boats breaking down before covering much more than . The Holland class were mostly used for testing, but in October 1905, after a Russian fleet mistakenly sank a number of British fishing vessels in the Dogger Bank incident, the Holland boats left harbour to attack the fleet. They were recalled before any engagement could take place. Boats Holland 1 submarine in dry dock Holland 1 submarine cross section * , launched on 2 October 1901 in secret.

Wikipedia could be considered to be an information commons to the extent that it produces and preserves information through current versions of articles and histories. Other examples of an information commons include Creative Commons. Introduction The concept of the \\"information commons\\" refers to the shared knowledge-base and the processes that facilitate or hinder its use. It also refers to a physical space, usually in an academic library, where any and all can participate in the processes of information research, gathering and production. The term commons refers to the land (or common grounds) that villagers shared for grazing purposes in simpler times. The issues that fall under this topic are varied and include: * Licenses written to access digital content, * Copyright law and similar intellectual property, * Freedom of information, * International trade, * Privacy, * Open-source software, * Open-access publishing, * Academic libraries integrated with CIT facilities, particularly in the United States, but including: ** Information Commons, a learning and study space at the University of Sheffield; ** Business/SPEA Information Commons, Indiana University, created August 2007. Some believe that the increasing control and commodification of information restricts humanity's ability to encourage and foster positive developments in its cultural, academic, and economic growth. The Internet The internet, and the subsequent internet age, took the information commons to another level by empowering consumers to create and distribute information on a mass scale.Kranich, Nancy. \\"The Information Commons.\\" (2004): 6. Weborn 6 May 2011. . The internet facilitated the decentralized production and distribution of information because it bypasses the control of some of more traditional publishing methods. Information published online are neither regulated by managers nor are they coordinated by price signals in the market. This results in a common-based production of knowledge that can be easily shared among individuals. Software commons The software commons consists of all computer software which is available at little or no cost and which can be reused with few restrictions. It includes open source software which can be modified with few restrictions. However the commons also includes software outside of these categories ‚Äì for instance, software which is in the public domain. Many innovative programmers have and released open source applications to the public, without the restrictive licensing conditions of commercial software. A popular example is Linux, an open source operating system. The server computers for Google Search run Linux. History Open-source programs started emerging in the 1960s. IBM was one of the first computer companies to offer their products to the public. Most of these computers came with free software that was universal among similar computers, and could be altered by anyone with the software. This changed in the 1970s when IBM decided to take more control of their products, removing the source codes and not allowing the redistribution of their software. In the 1980s and 1990s the software commons grew with the help of a bulletin board servers, accessed with dial-up modems. This expanded in the late 1990s with the growth of the Internet, which facilitated international cooperation and allowed individuals and groups to share their products more freely. The GNU Project was founded in 1983 to develop free software. In 1998 Netscape Communications Corporation announced that all future versions of their software would be free of charge and developed by an Open Source Community (Mozilla). This included Netscape Navigator, then the most popular web browser. Licensing commons Licensing is the process that copyright owners use to monitor reproduction, distribution, or other use of creative works. Many commercial licensing conditions are costly and restrictive. Licensing models used in information commons typically grant permission for a wide range of uses. The GNU General Public License (GPL), developed by Richard Stallman at MIT in the 1980s is one such license: \\"The GNU Free Documentation License is a form of copyleft intended for use on a manual, textbook or other document to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifications, either commercially or non-commercially.\\" Scholarly commons ‚ÄúIn the 1980s, many professional societies turned over their journal publishing to private firms as a way to contain membership fees and generate income.‚Äù Kranich, Nancy. \\"The Information Commons.\\" (2004): 18. Weborn 6 May 2011. . Prices of scholarly journals rose dramatically and publishing corporations restricted access to these journals through expensive licenses. Research libraries had no other choice but to cut many of their journal subscriptions. European and American academic communities began to find alternate ways to distribute and manage scholarly information. The Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC) was founded in 1998. ‚ÄúIt is an international alliance of academic and research libraries working to correct imbalances in the scholarly publishing system. Its pragmatic focus is to stimulate the emergence of new scholarly communication models that expand the dissemination of scholarly research and reduce financial pressures on libraries.\\" ReferencesFurther reading * Beagle, Donald Robert, with Donald Russell Bailey and Barbara Tierney (contributors). 2006.

He died 6 April 1960 in Tarrytown, New York. Primarily a writer of pulp fiction, he was active in Great Britain and the United States during the first half of the 20th century. Regarding the first two decades of his career, he wrote predominantly under the pen names Victor Rousseau, H. M. Egbert, and V. R. Emanuel, but, come the 1930s, officially abandoned these and numerous others in favour of establishing Victor Rousseau as a recognisable name in the pulp fiction field. He wrote \\"spicy\\" stories under the pen name Lew Merrill. Life and career The Argosy Emanuel enrolled at Harrow School in 1892 and Balliol College, Oxford in 1896. Due to unfortunate circumstances, he departed London and sailed south to Cape Town. For the next two years, he travelled South Africa, landing odd jobs as he went. While in Johannesburg, he learned the newspaper trade, landing a job with the Standard and Diggers' News and then the Transvaal Leader. With the hue and cry of the Boer War in full swing, Emanuel enlisted with Bethune's Mounted Infantry in 1899, but was discharged about 35 days later. Nearly a month later, he registered with the Colonial Scouts at Pietermaritzburg, and was officially discharged four months later, in April 1900. With his brief life experiences in South Africa and his involvement in the Boer War, he returned to London and readily sold his first novel, Derwent's Horse. This was a fictional, humorous account of two recruits within the spoofed Bethune's Mounted Infantry. With the proceeds from this novel, Emanuel realised that in journalism lay his future, and set sail again, this time for New York City, in June 1901. While between jobs in 1902, he began writing his second novel, Spartacus. It was written along the lines of Gustave Flaubert's novel, Salammbo. Three years after he began, he submitted it to Houghton-Mifflin in September 1905. It was rejected as a weak novel with poor characterisation. That same year, Emanuel assisted with the Jewish Encyclopedia, published by Funk & Wagnalls in 1905 and 1906. Cover of the pulp magazine Spicy Mystery Stories (February 1936, Vol. 2, no. 4) featuring Batman under the Lew Merrill name. His earliest known fiction output appeared in late 1905, in the form of children's vignettes, syndicated nationally, carrying the byline V. R. Emanuel. From early 1906 through 1907, he wrote regional Florida special articles for the Baltimore American. He took on an editorial post with Will Carleton's Every Where magazine in mid-1907. Here, he also created the alias Egbert Prentice. This, upon departure, morphed into the famous H. M. Egbert alias. Emanuel made his first official professional magazine sale, with the short Canadian frozen North tale, \\"The Last Cartridge,\\" in The Munsey (1907 September). Come 1908, he landed an editorial position with Harper's Weekly, a position he retained for three years. It is here that H. M. Egbert makes its earliest known debut, within the edition of 26 December 1908, attached to an article, rather than a fiction story. While employed by Harper & Brothers, he wrote special articles and the occasional short story. Stories he or the staff deemed unfit for Harper's Weekly were sold to the Illustrated Sunday Magazine, a nationally syndicated publication that was a subdivision of the Buffalo Times. Stories that failed to meet with this editor's approval were likewise circulated to lesser syndicates. In 1909, he wrote his landmark series The Surgeon of Souls, which featured Dr. Ivan Brodsky, a man who believed in faith and hypnotism as the cure toward laying ghosts, etc. These were syndicated amongst the big-city newspapers under the alias H. M. Egbert and sold poorly. Ironically, it found new life, nearly 15 years later, with 11 of the surviving tales being reprinted as original fiction within Weird Tales magazine, this time bylined as Victor Rousseau. Emanuel went on to author numerous newspaper series under a variety of genres, from 1910 through 1913. His first foray into the field of science fiction was the ill-fated series The Devil Chair. John Haynes, an Englishman, stripped of inherited land in America, is paralysed by a bullet to the spine, and railroaded into prison and left there to rot. While in the workshop, he fashions a gyroscopic device, that whilst adhered initially to a boot, propels him a couple hundred miles per hour, and while affixed to any object, can not be removed, until he deactivates it. The series is a fast-paced, pure blood-and-thunder romp across America and the world, as John Haynes hounds the villains and wreaks death and destruction on all those who wronged him. From 1913 through early December 1919, Emanuel, his wife and two children, moved from New York to Canada. While there, he was influenced to write the best fiction of his literary career, spawning the Canadian serials Jacqueline of Golden River and Wooden Spoil. Both would eventually become hardcovers and sell extremely well. Amongst these regional tales, early in 1914, he focused all his energies into creating the best, highest quality stories credited to his potential, in the form of the unofficial series title of Tales of the St. Lawrence Riverway. With the village of St. Jean, Quebec, as the focal point, the central character, in French, \\"le cur√©,\\" was in name Pere Sebastian or Father Sebastian. Each tale ended with a moral. Nine of the stories were printed in Blue Book magazine (1914 September through 1915 May), whilst others, unaccepted here, were sold elsewhere over the ensuing years. In fact, the series found new life, being reprinted well into the 1930s, by the Toronto Star and the Boston Globe. Come the Spring of 1914, all his creative juices flowed into his magnum opus, The Messiah of the Cylinder, an answering cry against H. G. Wells' When the Sleeper Wakes. Despite acceptance by Everybody's Magazine, the story lingered for three years (1917 June, July, August, September). While this serial gathered dust, another science fiction serial made its debut, leading many SF enthusiasts to believe this to be Emanuel's first true SF venture. Written during the summer of 1915, The Sea Demons was printed by All-Story Weekly and serialised in three instalments (1916 January 1, 15, 22). He was also briefly employed to write story adaptations of motion pictures into syndicated fiction stories for Universal Film. This led to the sale and release of his first screenplay, The Truant Soul (25 December 1916). A decade later, several of his pulp western stories were adapted into films. Emanuel continued to churn out science and fantasy serials for the various Munsey publications, including: *Fruit of the Lamp (The Argosy, 1918 February 2, 9, 16, 23) *Draft of Eternity (All-Story Weekly, 1918 June 1, 8, 15, 22) *Eric of the Strong Heart (Railroad Man's Magazine, 1918 November 16, 23, 30; 7 December 14) *The Eye of Balamok (All-Story Weekly, 1920 January 17, 24, 31) *My Lady of the Nile (Argosy All- Story Weekly, 1921 May 7, 14, 21, 28) Come mid-December 1919, the Emanuel family sailed for England. Unprepared for post-war impoverished England, Emanuel found employment difficult. Refusing to accept a working man's job again, he stuck firmly to writing fiction, while his family were at times homeless and starving. In early 1922, Emanuel returned to writing what he did best, a Canadian serial. The Home Trail was printed in People's Story Magazine (1922 August 25; 4 September 11, 18, 25) and sold for $1,000. With the sale of this novel, Emanuel sailed for America in July 1922, and promptly followed up his success with another $1,000 Canadian serial sale! Lee of the Northwest Mounted appeared in People's Popular Monthly (1923 January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August). This he succeeded later the same year with yet another $1,000 sale, in the form of Sergeant Forbes, Alias in four instalments of People's magazine (1923 August 15; 1 September 15; 1 October). The debut issue's cover of Astounding Stories featured Emanuel's serial \\"The Beetle Horde\\" From 1923 to 1925, Emanuel proudly sold three \\"serious\\" novels under his own surname. The first, The Story of John Paul, was suppressed as libelous; largely because his brother, Montague, is named in the novel as the protagonist's father; additionally, the novel was anti-Semitic. In late 1924, he sold Middle Years; this was released in early 1925, and dealt with a middle-aged man's life insecurities and fancy for a younger woman. With the elimination of his initial novel, which had announced a forthcoming sequel, Emanuel rewrote it as The Selmans, attacking England's Jews as hypocritical. With the success of his three 1922‚Äì1923 one-grand Canadian serial novels, Emanuel realised his future lay in writing Frozen North and Western tales for the pulp magazines, a market he continued to tap until 1942. He also wrote heavily during this period for the various self-proclaimed True magazines. However, since they were reportedly \\"true\\" tales, none of the tales sported a byline. Confirming which stories are his is nearly impossible, unless he used Canada or South Africa as background colour as potential clues. With The Surgeon of Souls finding new life in Weird Tales (1926‚Äì1927), Emanuel re- entered the fantasy field courtesy of Bernarr MacFadden's Ghost Stories magazine (1926‚Äì1929), running a series of psychic investigative tales featuring Dr. Martinus. He also sold five SF tales in 1930 to the newly launched Astounding Stories of Super-Science, and two novelettes in 1931 to Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories. With his elimination from the defunct Ghost Stories publication, he was invited to write for Clayton's Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror, supplying three tales (1931‚Äì1932). In 1932, he [officially] entered Weird Tales with two tales, and in 1933, one last SF tale in The Argosy. During the mid-1930s, after the Bernarr MacFadden outfit cut Emanuel from their \\"unofficial\\" literary contributing staff, he turned to the lucrative but somewhat embarrassing Spicy pulps market, churning out hundreds of short stories. Stories that failed to hit the pulp markets were rewritten, sex slightly included and thereby made saleable to the Spicy field. From 1940 to 1941, he wrote the first dozen \\"Jim Anthony, Super Detective\\" novels for Super-Detective; Jim Anthony was a pulp hero created in imitation of the vastly popular Doc Savage. Thereafter, he continued to heavily supply short stories to the Spicy market until 1947, then trickled a couple more for some years before entirely vanishing, forever.

Biography  An industrialist's son, Wagener was born in Durlach, graduated from Gymnasium and then became an army officer. In 1916 during the First World War, Wagener was promoted to the General Staff. After the war, Wagener was involved in the planning of an attack against the city of Posen (now Pozna≈Ñ, in Poland), but had to flee to the Baltic countries to avoid arrest. There he merged all Freikorps associations into the German Legion, and assumed leadership after its leader, Paul Siewert, was murdered. After returning to Germany, he was active in Freikorps operations in Upper Silesia, Saxony, and the Ruhr area. In 1920 he studied economics and managed to broaden his knowledge by traveling abroad. In 1929 Wagener joined the Nazi Party (NSDAP) and the Sturmabteilung (SA), having been recruited by his old Freikorps comrade Franz Pfeffer von Salomon.Kershaw p. 348. Wagener was able to put his business acumen and contacts to good usage for the Nazi Party, in this case for the SA: > Wagener had used his business contacts to persuade a cigarette firm to > produce \\"Sturm\\" cigarettes for SA men ‚Äì a \\"sponsorship\\" deal benefiting both > the firm and SA coffers. Stormtroopers were strongly encouraged to smoke > only these cigarettes. A cut from the profit went to the SA .... He functioned as SA Chief of Staff from October 1929 through December 1930, assuming effective command of the SA for a few months in the wake of the Stennes Revolt until the assumption of command by Ernst R√∂hm as the new Chief of Staff in early January 1931.After the first Stennes Revolt in August 1930, Hitler assumed Supreme Command of the SA, having cashiered Wagener's friend and war comrade Pfeffer von Salomon as SA head. Wagener was the de facto leader of the SA from this time until R√∂hm's return in January 1931. See Stennes Revolt. In 1933 he became a member of the Reichstag. In January 1931, Wagener led the Political-economic Department of the NSDAP, and in September 1932 he was appointed the F√ºhrer's personal economic advisor. Hitler appointed him Reich Commissar for the Economy from April to June 1933.See Lambert p. 237. By late 1930 or early 1931 Wagener had made a mark on National Socialist economic policy. As Patch notes (p. 201-02): > Wagener formulated an original set of economic policies based on corporatist > and leadership principles in confidential talks with Hitler and succeeded in > recruiting many middle echelon industrial managers and owners of small > factories for the NSDAP....[A confidential draft by Wagener] embraced the > ideal of the corporatist \\"company union\\" (Werksgemeinschaft) and described > the employer as the \\"Fuhrer\\" within his factory. All disputes over wages and > working conditions would be settled within the \\"family\\" of the individual > company in the National Socialist state of the future. Trade unions would be > responsible merely for vocational training. Wagener was replaced in his role as Commissioner for Economic Questions by Wilhelm Keppler, as Wagener had become embroiled in \\"coordination\\" disputes with leaders of industry after the National Socialist assumption of national power in January 1933, even forcibly occupying the industry-run trade association \\"Reich Association of German Industry\\" with the intention of shutting it down.Evans p. 384. Internal conflicts led to legal proceedings against Wagener in 1933 and 1934 in a case brought before the USCHLA (Party tribunal). After the Night of the Long Knives, Wagener was detained for a short time. Nevertheless, he was rehabilitated, and he resumed his career in the army. Wagener signs the instrument of surrender for the German forces in the Dodecanese to the British, 8 May 1945 In the Second World War, Wagener served at the front, rising to the rank of major general and becoming a division commander. Under his command of the island Rhodes, a post he held from 20 July 1944, almost the complete Jewish population was murdered. After the war, Wagener found himself first in British and later, from 1947 to 1952, Italian prisoner of war camps. In 1946, while being held by the British, Wagener wrote his memoirs about Hitler and the Nazi Party's early history, entitled Hitler aus n√§chster N√§he.

She toured in the Bill Kenwright production of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs An Ideal Husband, directed by Peter Hall, with Michael Denison and Dulcie Gray and appeared regularly with John Mortimer in Mortimer‚Äôs Miscellany, his self-devised anthology of poetry and prose presented at theatres around Britain. Later television work included the sitcom Close to Home (1989‚Äì90) and the sporting drama Trainer (1992). Honours She was made a Fellow of the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama. She also had a public house named after her in Pontypridd. Jewellery design Following the death of her son Linford in 1999 she turned her back on acting and concentrated on her passion for jewellery design. Rees founded a jewellery design company, Angharad, based in Knightsbridge. Pieces that she designed and produced featured in the film Elizabeth: The Golden Age (2007). Personal life On 18 September 1973, Rees married the actor Christopher Cazenove, who had made his name at around the same time in The Regiment. They had two sons: Linford James (20 July 1974 ‚Äì 10 September 1999) and Rhys William (born 1976). Linford was killed in a car accident on the M11 motorway in Essex while returning to collect his books from Cambridge University, where he had been awarded the degree of Master of Philosophy. Cazenove and Rees divorced in 1994 but remained close. Cazenove died from the effects of septicaemia in 2010. Rees had a relationship with British actor Alan Bates; on 29 April 2005, after Bates' death, Rees married David McAlpine, a member of the McAlpine construction company, at The Royal Hospital Chelsea, London.

Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes led the tributes. He said \\"If there was one thing she was superb at, it was friendship. And not just sympathetic friendship, but hard-working, useful, practical assistance. She was anxious, I think, that she should not be defined, entirely, as the star of a popular series, as one half of a golden couple, as a mother and hostess, although she excelled in all of these. She wanted also to be remembered as a serious actress whose early career might have gone on to greatness had she not made the personal decision to change direction [by having a family].\\" Filmography *Jane Eyre (1970) - Louise *To Catch a Spy (1971) - Victoria *Hands of the Ripper (1971) - Anna *Under Milk Wood (1972) - Gossamer Beynon *The Love Ban (1973) - Jackie *Moments (1974) - Chrissy *La petite fille en velours bleu (1978) - Macha *The Wolves of Kromer (1998) - Mary ReferencesExternal links * * Angharad Rees' jewellery design company website * Rees profile at www.filmreference.com Category:1944 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Actresses from Cardiff Category:People educated at Commonweal Lodge Category:Alumni of Rose Bruford College Category:Welsh film actresses Category:Welsh television actresses Category:Welsh stage actresses Category:20th-century Welsh actresses Category:British jewellery designers Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in England Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:University of Paris alumni Category:Welsh radio actresses ","title":"Angharad Rees"},{"id":"4108952","text":"The Caldwell Zoo is an zoo located in the city of Tyler, Texas. It features animals from all over the world. The Caldwell Zoo is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).  History  The zoo had its origins in the Child Development Laboratory, which was started in 1937 and was operated by the Hogg Foundation and the American Association of University Women of Tyler. It was run by David King Caldwell and his wife, who brought in many animals for the enjoyment of the children.David King Caldwell was a native of Scottsboro, Alabama, which he never forgot and where he gave generously to local causes. That community showed its deep gratitude to him by naming a park and a school after him. The park is King Caldwell Park (the name by which he went) and the school is Caldwell School, in which he took great interest and for many of whose students he paid for college educations. The zoo was officially opened on its current site in 1953. By 1967, the zoo featured over 500 animals from 87 different species. In 1970, the zoo was broken into, and several animals were killed. This prompted the children of the area to collect money to help restore things. Enough money was raised for the zoo to acquire an African elephant and was the catalyst to modernize the entire zoo. The city granted an additional to the zoo in 1976, and a large, long-term expansion project was undertaken. A new elephant enclosure was built, and giraffes were added in 1978. In 1983 a native Texas area was opened, and in 1984 reptile and aquarium sections were opened. In 1987 major reconstruction of the African exhibits was completed, creating large pasture areas and an overlook. Throughout the 90s, more improvements were added. In 2002, a new veterinary hospital was completed, along with brooding areas, and a quarantine facility. The zoo now houses a \\"Wild Bird Walkabout\\" featuring over 400 parakeets and cockatiels. Bird, otter and penguin presentations have also expanded, allowing for the further education of the public. Two white tigers, Meka and Willieking were traded from the Alexandria Zoo in Louisiana in 2007 and have now been declared permanent displays, though they were originally only supposed to stay until the beginning of September 2007. The Caldwell Zoo also houses the largest African elephant in North America. Breeding As a member of the AZA, the Caldwell Zoo participates in many breeding projects. Animals born at the zoo include reticulated giraffes, flamingoes, black rhinoceros, jaguars, giant anteaters, and many others. The zoo also participated in the first cheetah born through artificial insemination. African penguins are now being bred as well and will probably have young as soon as the currently owned penguins reach sexual maturity. Under one of these AZA breeding programs, the zoo had a litter of four lion cubs born in January 2014. It is the first time in 20 years that the zoo has had a litter of lion cubs. The future Plans for the future include expanding into the unused land surrounding the current zoo, with a new glass- enclosed aviary and improved habitats for animals. There will be several new animal additions accompanying these expansions, including a colony of meerkats.

The Rondevlei Nature Reserve is located in Grassy Park, Zeekoevlei and Lavenderhill, suburbs of Cape Town, South Africa. The bird sanctuary covers approximately of mostly permanent wetland and consists of a single large brackish lagoon. The nature reserve is among the most important wetlands for birds in South Africa despite being situated directly alongside the Zeekoevlei. A number of islands on the vlei act as vital breeding sites. Rondevlei is home to about 230 bird species, a variety of small mammals and reptiles like caracal, porcupine, Cape fox, grysbuck, steenbuck and mongoose, as well as a hippopotamus population which was re- introduced in 1981 as a means to control an alien grass species from South America, which had covered the shoreline and was threatening to engulf the vlei itself. It boasts unusual and threatened ecosystems like strandveld, sand plains fynbos, Cape lowland wetland vegetation and indigenous coastal fynbos vegetation with unique plants found nowhere else in the world. Footprint of a hippo on the waterside trail. The hippos stay under water during the day so they can only be spotted during the night or in the evening. In February 2004, a young hippo named Hugo or Houdini escaped from Rondevlei after it was bullied by an older dominant male and was on the run for 10 months until it was caught in December and moved to an Eastern Cape private reserve. History The reserve was established in 1952 in cooperation with the Cape Divisional Council (now Cape Metropolitan Council), when the area was still used by locals to graze horses and cattle, for woodcutting and flower picking. Originally it consisted of the vlei and about of land, which was extended in 1963 and 1987 by adding dunes and seasonal wetlands to the south of the vlei to the reserve. To prevent flooding of the built-up areas, which contained then mainly sub-economic housing, a dam at the south-eastern end of the vlei was built to permanently lower the level of Rondevlei. The management of the reserve was taken over by the South Peninsula Municipality in 1997 and it is now part of the City of Cape Town. Facilities The facilities in the reserve include an about long waterside trail along the shoreline with six bird hides and two large wooden observation towers, a terrarium and aquarium, as well as the Leonard Gill museum and an environmental education centre with lecture theater and resource centre. Besides birdwatching visitors are offered guided tours, boat cruises, conference facilities and secluded overnight accommodation within the reserve which are organized by a community-based company, Imvubu Nature Tours, which was established in 2002 with the use of poverty relief funds, made available by the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism.

Biography=Early life Leonard Bruce Archer (known primarily as Bruce Archer or L. Bruce Archer) was born in 1922.Much of the biographical information in this account is taken from two sources - 1) Professor Bruce Archer, Department of Design Research, Royal College of Art, Courses in design research 1976-77, unpublished lecture notes; 2) Professor Bruce Archer, Autobiography of research at the Royal College of Art 1961-1986, unpublished manuscript. His father was a Regimental Sergeant Major in the Scots Guards and his mother a dressmaker and a trained amateur artist. During his schooldays, at Henry Thornton Grammar School, he wanted to be a painter, but he was academically bright and not allowed to continue with art beyond fifteen. His school certificates were in entirely scientific subjects. The Second World War intervened before he could go to art school or university and he joined his father's regiment. He saw service in Italy but left after three years (1941‚Äì44) on medical grounds. The war was still on and, after giving him an aptitude test, the Ministry of Labour said to him, as he recorded wryly: Which he decided to do. CareerCareer overview= Bruce Archer was a chartered mechanical engineer who spent most of his working life in schools of art and design, including more than 25 years at the Royal College of Art. He promoted the use of systems-level analysis, evidence-based design, and evaluation through field testing within industrial design, and led a multi-disciplinary team which employed these methods in practice, including most notably their application to the design of what became the standard British hospital bed. He went on to become head of a postgraduate research and teaching department where he identified that scholarly inquiry in design was just as vital as it was in the arts, the humanities and the sciences, and argued that design warranted its own body of scholarship and knowledge no less than conventional academic disciplines. He proposed that modelling be recognised as the fundamental competence of design, just as numeracy underpins mathematics and literacy the humanities and he believed that ‚Äì like both literacy and numeracy ‚Äì it should be widely taught.Archer, Bruce, 'Design as a Discipline', Design Studies, Vol 1, No 1, July 1979, pp.17-20 Archer trained a generation of design researchers, showing them how the procedures of scholarly research based on well-founded evidence and systematic analysis were as applicable in design as in the more traditional academic subjects.Archer, Bruce, 'A View of the Nature of Design Research', in Jacques, R and Powell, J (eds), Design:Science:Method, Westbury House, Guildford, 1981 For design practice he argued there was a need for method and rigour, and for decisions to be recorded and explained so they could, if necessary, be defended. Today, practitioners are familiar with these issues through the requirements of quality assurance, while in academia the Research Assessment Exercise has pushed even the art and design community into taking research seriously. Thirty or forty years ago, however, Archer's ideas were radical and pioneering, and the very existence of his research department - in an art college - controversial. It was his own force of character and his persuasive ability to argue his case with absolute clarity and conviction that ensured the department's survival, and provided him with the opportunity to demonstrate that design is not just a craft skill but a knowledge-based discipline in its own right. =Early career= Bruce Archer worked as an engineering designer in manufacturing, designing jigs and tools and later process plant. He attended evening classes for years at Northampton College, London (now City University) where he trained as a mechanical engineering designer, eventually gaining his Higher National Certificate in mechanical engineering. He became a member of the Institution of Engineering Designers in 1950, and in 1951 was awarded its national prize for the best thesis on design. He joined the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the same year. =Consultant= In 1951 the Festival of Britain took place and inspired Bruce, leading him to later state: In 1953 he left full-time employment in industry to set up his own consultancy ‚Äì the Scientists' and Technologists' Engineering Partnership ‚Äì and started teaching evening classes at the Central School of Art and Design becoming a full-time lecturer there in 1957. He began writing articles for Design magazine, promoting what he called 'a rational approach to design'. At a party given by a colleague from the Central School, he was approached by Tom√°s Maldonado, Director of the Ulm School of Design, and offered a job acting as a bridge between two rival factions at the school ‚Äì 'scientists' and 'artists'. Archer moved there in 1960 as a guest professor to find two opposing belief systems. The ergonomists and psychologists believed in analysis and experiment as the basis for design, whereas the stylists were mostly concerned with form, and had evolved design rules about proportion, colour and texture which they thought of as a logical system for creating the cool, minimalist look for which Ulm became famous.Krampen, M and H≈ërmann, 'The Ulm School of Design - Beginnings of a Project of Unyielding Modernity', Ernst&Sohn;, Berlin, 2003. . Archer tried to convey each side's belief systems across the divide, but each group thought he had aligned himself with the other. Maldonado had left Ulm even before Archer arrived, and he found himself isolated. Later he said that learning how the two cultures thought was a highly formative experience. =Designing hospital equipment= In 1961 Misha Black was appointed head of industrial design at the Royal College of Art and asked him to lead a research project called Studies in the function and design of non-surgical hospital equipment, being funded by the Nuffield Foundation. Archer returned in the summer of 1962 and, with a small multi-disciplinary team, identified four urgent design problems: a receptacle for soiled dressings, a means of reducing incorrect dispensing of medicines to ward patients, the need for a standard design for hospital beds, and a way to prevent smoke control doors being routinely propped open. They presented their report at the end of the first year to the Nuffield Foundation. Unfortunately: Archer and Misha Black were both stunned. Undaunted, Archer took a job at the Eldorado ice cream factory in Southwark, loading ice cream into refrigerated vans every night and working at the College unpaid during the day. Eventually, commercial funding was found for the soiled dressings receptacle, and in 1963 he gave up his evening job when support was obtained from the King Edward's Hospital Fund for London to study the medicine-dispensing problem. A radical solution was devised - a medicine trolley on wheels that could be securely padlocked to a wall when not in use. The hospital bed problem was also re-examined. The King Edward's Hospital Fund became the King's Fund and was seeking a major exercise to promote its new nationwide role. It took on the standardisation of the hospital bed. Archer was appointed to a Working Party, and in due course won a contract for a standard specification and a prototype design. After widespread consultation, evidence gathering through direct observations, and extensive field trials using mock-ups and test devices, the specification was adopted by the Kings Fund and became a British Standard; a successful prototype was also developed by Kenneth Agnew at the college for a commercial bed manufacturer. The hospital bed project has been documented by an historian.Lawrence, G., Hospital beds by design: a socio-historical account of the 'King's Fund Bed',1960-1975, PhD Thesis, London University, 2001Lawrence, G., Kings Fund Beds, The Lancet, Vol 358, 8 September 2001, p. 848 The fire door problem was solved by the use of electro-magnetic door-holders wired to the fire alarm, which released the doors when the alarm was triggered. So solutions to all four of the original projects were delivered. In the process, Archer had demonstrated that work study, systems analysis, and ergonomics, were proper tools for use by designers, and that systematic methods were not inimical to creativity in design, but essential contributors to it. =Professor= Generalizing from his experiences in these and other design projects undertaken by what became the Industrial Design (Engineering) Research Unit, Archer presented his ideas at design conferences and prepared the paper for which he is perhaps most widely known, 'Systematic method for designers'Reprinted in Cross, N. (ed.) 'Developments in Design Methodology', Wiley, UK, 1984, pp.57-82. which was published by the Council for Industrial Design in 1965 after a series in Design magazine. A thesis on 'The structure of the design process' was published by the US National Bureau of Standards in 1969. Both papers were translated into several languages, and he continued to receive requests for reprints for a decade or more afterwards. He was awarded the Kaufmann International Design Research Award in 1964. In 1967 he helped to found the cross-disciplinary Design Research Society, and was awarded a doctorate by the Royal College in 1968. Many of his ideas were brought together in 'Technological innovation: a methodology', a paper published by the Science Policy Foundation in 1971. In that same year the Rector of the college, Sir Robin Darwin, called him into his office and as Archer said later: Soon his Department of Design Researchhttp://www.drs2016.org/exhibition/#ddr1 had a complement of more than thirty researchers. As they marched daily into the college's Senior Common Room they represented quite a large body of people, and were not entirely welcomed by staff from other departments. Archer himself reluctantly became what he described as a traveling salesman to ensure a steady flow of research contracts. After two or three years, there was a change of direction following a College decision to turn the Department of Design Research into a post- graduate teaching department like every other. Funding was won from the Science Research Council to study design processes, and postgraduates were recruited to undertake masters and doctoral studies. Design graduates arrived to learn how to conduct research, while others from disciplines like psychology and mathematics learned to apply their skills to the discipline of design. Archer's own lectures ranged widely across the philosophy of science, ethics, aesthetics, economics, innovation, measurement and value theory, and were delivered with directness and enthusiasm. The Department itself was organized in a highly systematic way, with procedural memoranda setting out agendas for every type of meeting including highly structured progress reviews for students. Every event was meticulously recorded in his daily log. From his belief that design was just as important an academic topic as the arts, the humanities and the sciences, Bruce was instrumental in the move to see it taught as part of the school curriculum. He campaigned to influence the Department for Education and Science, and ran short courses at the college for school teachers. He launched a Department for Design Education at the college, giving teachers the opportunity to undertake masters level research into design. He was made a CBE in 1976. =Director of Research= In 1984, Jocelyn Stevens was appointed as Rector of the Royal College of Art, and he peremptorily closed the Department of Design Research. It had operated successfully for exactly 25 years. Archer himself was appointed Director of Research with college-wide responsibilities. Though approaching retirement age, his knowledge of the workings of the college and his academic credibility placed him in great demand, and Stevens thought nothing of contacting him at any time of day or night for advice. =Retirement= After retiring in 1988, Archer ran in-service training courses about research for art and design institutes and was active as Chair of the Design Research Society 1988‚Äì90, and later as its first President 1992 - 2000. In March 2004, a dinner was held at the Royal College of Art organised by the Society at which he was presented with its Lifetime Achievement Award.Award Archer himself, though frail, made a typically forceful and eloquent acceptance speech in which he acknowledged the contributions of his many co-workers, and contrasted the skills of decision making and advocacy which typify design, with those of inquiry and analysis which are essential in research. Family Bruce was married to Joan Henrietta Allen for fifty years. They had one daughter, Miranda. Miranda trained as an architect before becoming a high school teacher in design technology ‚Äì the very subject that Bruce had done so much to see established in secondary education.

His family had emigrated from Cuba, where his father was a lawyer. Outside baseball and numbers (illegal gambling), he owned and operated a cigar shop in downtown Manhattan. He later served as a scout and director of international scouting for the Giants franchise in Major League Baseball. He was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006. Biography Pompez was born on May 3, 1890, in Key West, Florida, the oldest of four children born to Cuban immigrants Jose and Loretta Pompez. His father was a lawyer and cigar manufacturer who had connections to Cuban author and dissident Jose Marti. Jose Pompez was on the board of directors for the Key West chapter of the Cuban Revolutionary Party;Burgos, p. 13 he was elected to the Florida House of Representatives as a Republican in 1892.Burgos, p. 14 He was a state representative until his death until 1897. Alex and his family struggled financially after his father willed his estate to the insurgency.Burgos, p. 18 Alex Pompez owned the Cuban Stars of the Eastern Colored League between 1923 and 1928 and the New York Cubans of the Negro National League from 1935 to 1951. He also helped organize the first Negro League World Series in . He signed numerous Latin American players for his Negro league teams, including Mart√≠n Dihigo, Minnie Mi√±oso and Alejandro Oms. Several owners in the Negro National League, including Pompez, were numbers bankers. Pompez was one of New York's leading numbers bankers during the 1920s but was forced to join Dutch Schultz in 1932. His connections with Schultz's organization led to his indictment in 1936 for involvement in policy rackets when New York County District Attorney Thomas Dewey selected him as one of the targets in a crackdown on New York City racketeering. Pompez fled to Mexico after being tipped off to his arrest; he was eventually arrested by Mexican authorities, but Mexican officials refused to extradite him. Pompez decided to return to the U.S. as a state witness in the investigation. He is considered the only man who survived after turning informant against another racketeer. In 1948, sensing that baseball's integration would change the Negro leagues, Pompez arranged for the New York Cubans to become a minor league affiliate of the New York Giants. Pompez scouted Latin America for the Giants, and they signed several players through Pompez, including Camilo Pascual, Tony Oliva and Orlando Cepeda. In 1950, Pompez submitted a favorable scouting report to the Giants on Fidel Castro. He was hired by the New York Giants to oversee their Latin American operations in 1950.http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-02-12/yoan-moncada-cuba- dominican-republic-puerto-rico Pompez served on the Baseball Hall of Fame's special Committee on Negro League Baseball in the early 1970s. He died at age 83 in New York City. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2006. Pompez died in 1974 and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City.

The Boston Globe once described him as \\"the horse with the greatest potential--and the worst luck--whose very story was a fairytale of racing history.\\" Background His bloodlines included Northern Dancer, Swaps, Tim Tam, Ribot, Tom Fool, and Count Fleet. He was purchased for $13,500 by Peter and Francis Martin, owners of a meat-packing plant in Boston, Massachusetts. Racing career Timely Writer began his career as a claimer at Monmouth Park, winning by eight lengths and tying a track record set in 1981. Ridden by Roger Danjean, the colt also won the Grade I Hopeful Stakes. Under Jeffrey Fell, he won October's Grade I Champagne Stakes, in which he overtook the 4-5 favorite by nearly five lengths. Timely Writer's racing career was marked by several disappointments. He was passed over in favor of Deputy Minister for the 1981 Eclipse Award as champion two-year-old colt. Key wins in the 1982 Flamingo Stakes and Florida Derby made him a favorite for the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing in 1982, until a severe case of colic sidelined him for the spring season. With a 50% chance of surviving surgery, Timely Writer recovered and came back to win at Saratoga Race Course less than six months later. Dr. William O. Reed purchased the colt's breeding rights for $3 million. Before heading to the breeding shed, Timely Writer was set to complete the 1982 racing season. Traces of an anti-bacterial substance found in his system forced the horse's withdrawal from the $150,000 Jerome Handicap, for which he was the favorite. Unprepared for his next start, he finished seventh but rebounded to win his next race. Timely Writer later competed in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. He ran in third before jockey Jeffrey Fell began to urge the colt forward as they approached the far turn. Suddenly, the horse's left foreleg snapped and he fell to the ground, where three other horses stumbled over him. With no possibility of repairing his leg, Timely Writer was humanely euthanized. Another colt, Johnny Dance, who had collided with the fallen horse, was also euthanized. Honors Timely Writer was buried at the head of the stretch at Belmont Park near the filly Ruffian. A tribute to Timely Writer is included in the book \\"Beyond the Rainbow Bridge\\", by Kimberly Gatto (2005, Half Halt Press) . Blood-Horse magazine also printed a tribute article in its September 29, 2007, issue.

The T2 is also known as the \\"D√ºsseldorf transporter\\", since it was built in D√ºsseldorf from 1967 on. The third series, built from 1996 at Ludwigsfelde, was branded the Mercedes-Benz Vario. Some T2s were assembled by Mercedes-Benz Espa√±a in their Alcobendas assembly plant. For Argentina, the first T2 product are the L 608 D in 1969 until 1990. In 1989, the new products are the L 710, L 914 and 814 with the LO variant (chassis bus). The production ceased in 1966. The Venezuelan version of the T2 was manufactured in Barcelona by the Grupo Consorcio 1390 S.A. (currently MMC Automoritz S.A.) as the Mercedes-Benz Class L3. The L3 was built from 1969 up to 1978, when the company was bought by the Ford Motor Company. First generation (1967‚Äì1986) T2 407D pre-facelift T2 407D post-facelift In 1967, the T2 was introduced as a successor to the L 319 / L 406 series. The vehicle filled the gap between the smaller Mercedes-Benz T1 (or Bremen Transporter) and the heavier trucks, manufactured in W√∂rth. The T2 was available as a box van, a flat-bed light truck (with single or double cab), or a minibus. From 1977 the chassis was offered, for the mounting of larger box van and bus bodies, in two different widths. In 1981 the T2 received a facelift, the most visible differences were the new radiator grille, which now was a moulding of black plastic. The various T2 versions were popular for a wide range of applications: they were used as delivery vans, light builders' vans or trucks, fire-brigade and rescue support vehicles, post office parcel delivery vans (featuring sliding doors) and for very many other uses. In the early 1970s, T2 was also offered branded as a Hanomag-Henschel. In Brazil and some other South American countries it was built with a turbo system. Production of flat-bed trucks of the first generation ended after 19 year construction period, after approximately 450,000 vehicles had been produced, in 1986.

The breeches of the four torpedo tubes are at center The Holland 602 type submarine, also known as the H-class submarine, was one of the most numerous submarines of World War I. The type was designed by the Electric Boat Co. of the United States, but most of the boats were built abroad: in Canada by the subsidiary of the British Vickers company and in British shipyards. Operators included the United States Navy, the Chilean Navy, the Royal Navy (33 submarines), the Imperial Russian Navy, the Soviet Navy, the Italian Regia Marina, the Royal Canadian Navy, the Royal Dutch Navy and the navy of the short-lived Ukrainian State. Background and history The predecessor for this class were two submarines ordered in 1911 for the Chilean Navy, to the John Philip Holland design 19-E and design 19-B. These eventually became the s of the Royal Canadian Navy. Origin of project's number is in Electric Boat company rule, according to which, project variant for export purposes was named with replaced digits and with adding 0 between them. Thus, project EB 26 became the project EB 602. Three prototypes were then built to an improved design 30, with an increased displacement of 358/434 tons. These became the United States H-class submarines and were designated , and . In October 1914, after the start of World War I, the British Admiralty ordered ten submarines to design 602E, to be built by Canadian Vickers in Montreal, Quebec. These would become the British H-class submarines. Another ten submarines were secretly constructed at Fore River Yard at Quincy, Massachusetts, in the then neutral United States. This group was impounded by the United States government and ended up in the Chilean Navy and the Royal Canadian Navy after the American declaration of war. A third group, of twenty- five British H-class subs, was constructed in 1917-1919 in Britain, many of them serving in World War II. In the summer of 1915 eight type 602 submarines were ordered by the Italian Regia Marina. These were built in Montreal, Quebec. In 1917 the Imperial Russian Navy ordered a total of 17 submarines for its Baltic and Black Sea Fleets. These were built at a temporary shipyard in Barnet on Burrard Inlet outside Vancouver, British Columbia. They were then disassembled, taken by ship to Vladivostok, by the Trans-Siberian Railroad to Saint Petersburg and Nikolayev to be reassembled in Russian shipyards. In Russia they were known as the Amerikansky Golland-class submarines. Six of the boats were undelivered at the time of the Russian Revolution of 1917. These were later bought by the United States Navy, and after reassembly at the Puget Sound Navy Yard, they became the United States H-class submarines H-4 - H-9. In 1918 the Black Sea Fleet submarines –êG-21-–êG-26 were taken over by the Ukrainian State Navy. In May 1918 the Finnish Navy salvaged two of the Baltic Fleet submarines scuttled off Hanko at the end of the Finnish Civil War, but was unable to refit them for service.

She was built in 1953 by Alexander Stephen & Sons at Glasgow, Scotland as the ocean liner SS Olympia for the Greek Line. Greek Line withdrew the Olympia from service in 1974. Following an extended lay-up period and reconstruction into a diesel-engined Caribbean cruise ship, the ship re- emerged in 1983 as MS Caribe I for Commodore Cruise Line. In 1993 she was sold to Regal Cruise Line and received her final name. She operated for Imperial Majesty Cruise Line from 2003 until 2009. The Regal Empress was also the last vintage passenger ship to regularly sail from the United States. Service history One of the longest serving passenger ships in history, and the only ship expressly built for the Greek Line was initially named Olympia. Olympia was completed by Alexander Stephen & Sons, on the River Clyde, in 1953. She was initially measured at , and carried 138 First Class, and 1169 Tourist Class passengers. She was registered in Liberia. Parsons turbines of 25,000 shp drove her at a service speed of 21 knots (23 knots maximum). The maiden voyage left Glasgow for Liverpool and New York City on 20 October 1953. Her first voyage on the intended route from Piraeus to New York City as an ocean liner did not take place until March 1955 due to legal complications. In 1961, the route was extended to Haifa, Israel. Her voyages to New York usually included numerous intermediary stops. Olympia was a frequent caller with immigrant families to Pier 21 in Halifax, Nova Scotia making 86 calls at Halifax.\\"Ship Arrivals Database\\", Canadian Museum of Immigration at Pier 21 In 1968, Olympia was registered in Greece, and spent an increasing number of voyages cruising, this becoming her exclusive occupation in 1970. By this time she had been re-measured at . She was laid up at Piraeus in 1974, and the Greek Line suffered financial collapse the following year. In 1981, the Olympia was bought by Sally Shipping with the plan was to use the ship as both a floating hotel and for occasional Caribbean cruises. She was renamed Caribe and refitted with Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz diesels of 20,270 shp replacing the steam turbines. The Diesel engines would reduce her service speed to approximately 18 knots. In addition to the new power plant, extensive interior modifications were carried out. These modifications included but were not confined to: Removal of the Agean pool and converting that space into the Mermaid Bar, conversion of the Calypso Room, Card Room and Drawing Room into suites. The Derby Room and Taverna, aft of the Olympian Hall restaurant on restaurant deck was converted into a casino. One public room that remained untouched throughout her life was her gorgeous, paneled library on Promenade deck. When the hotel plan was cancelled she returned to cruising and was renamed Caribe I in 1983, in the Commodore Cruise Line fleet. The ship's original funnel had been replaced by exhaust pipes decorated in a framework design. In 1988, this was replaced by a more traditional funnel. In 1993 she was sold to Regal Cruises and renamed Regal Empress, and began sailing out of Port Manatee in the winters and New York City during the summers. She is now described as being only . Following the collapse of Regal Cruises, the Regal Empress was purchased by Imperial Majesty Cruise Line for their two-night cruise service to The Bahamas, the Regal Empress being cheaper to operate and carrying more passengers than their own ship OceanBreeze. The Regal Empress was featured in a late-2007 episode of the TV show MythBusters, where it was used to demonstrate that it is possible to waterski from the back of a cruise ship.YouTube In September 2008, the Regal Empress was removed from service to be used as an aid in the recovery of the aftermath of Hurricane Ike. She was laid up in Texas for about 2 months. She returned to service in December 2008. Her last voyage took place on 6 March 2009. On 9 March 2009 the Regal Empress was retired by Imperial Majesty Cruise Line. She was laid up for sale and inspection in Freeport, Bahamas until late March. It was reported by Maritime Matters on 26 March that the Regal Empress was sold for scrap. The Regal Empress was replaced by a newer ship, the MS Bahamas Celebration. The new ship carried on the same cruise itineraries as the Regal Empress did. The Bahamas Celebration operated for a new cruise line, Celebration Cruise Line, until the company ceased operations in early 2015 following the ship's accidental grounding in 2014.

It is a cover of \\"Money for Nothing\\" by Dire Straits with the lyrics replaced by those of The Beverly Hillbillies theme song. The music video, which appeared as part of Yankovic's film UHF, is a parody of the \\"Money for Nothing\\" music video. The song features Dire Straits members Mark Knopfler on guitar and Guy Fletcher on synthesizer, Knopfler's one condition for allowing the parody. Jim West, Yankovic's own guitarist, then practiced the song for weeks. As a result of that and because Knopfler had become more relaxed after having played it for several years, West's version sounded more like the original version. The song is credited to Mark Knopfler and Sting (writers of the original \\"Money for Nothing\\") and Paul Henning (writer of \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\"). Track listing # \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\" - 3:10 # \\"Generic Blues\\" - 4:35 Title negotiation Originally the title of the song was going to be simply \\"Beverly Hillbillies\\"; however, the title of the song was changed to \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\" (with an asterisk), and it is legally copyrighted and registered as such. Yankovic commented on the legal complications with the titling of the song in the DVD audio commentary for the film UHF, explaining: \\"We had to name that song 'Money for Nothing \\"slash\\" Beverly Hillbillies \\"asterisk\\"' because the lawyers told us that had to be the name. Those wacky lawyers! Whatcha gonna do?\\"Al Yankovic \\"UHF\\" DVD Audio Commentary (0:35:15) Yankovic also gave the following comment on his official website in regards to the title: \\"That incredibly stupid name is what the lawyers insisted that the parody be listed as. I'm not sure why, and I've obviously never been very happy about it.\\"\\"Ask Al\\" Q&As; for October 1998 Yankovic later stated he would rather have wanted the title to be either 'Money for Nothing for the Beverly Hillbillies' or 'Beverly Hillbillies for Nothing'. Music video The music video for the \\"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*\\" was done in the same style as the original. However, several concepts were parodied. *In the opening of the original video, a skinny, computer-generated man (who \\"lip syncs\\" Sting's vocals) is watching television. In the parody, this character is modeled after George Newman (Yankovic's character in UHF). *The live action scenes are similar to the original, including partially rotoscoped-animation in bright neon colors, light emitting from the lead singer's head, and the \\"invisible man\\" playing the guitar. *In the original, a portly blue-collar worker is shown \\"lip syncing\\" to Knopfler's vocals. In the parody, this character is modeled on the Jed Clampett character from Beverly Hillbillies. *A short live-action clip displays the song as \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\" by George Newman (Yankovic's character in UHF). *David Silverman, later of Simpsons fame, designed the characters seen in the animated music video. *In the original videos, the guitars simply have neon-styled effects added to them. In the parody, one of the guitars is made to twist as if it were solely neon lights. *The original video features frequent camera cuts centered at Mark Knopfler in the final verse. This sequence is parodied in Yankovic's video during the first verse with him noticing the camera is cutting around him, constantly losing track of it before finally grabbing it and holding it in place himself.

He studied under noted Latvian painter Vilhelms Purvƒ´tis at the Latvia Art Academy. Padegs' style was original and shocking ‚Äì using themes which were very iconoclastic at the time.  Padegs personality  KƒÅrlis Padegs was born on 8 October 1911 in Tor≈Üakalns, workers district of Riga. Padegs spent all his life in Riga with the exception of several years in childhood during World War I when he lived in Dorpat (Tartu) Estonia. The presence of his motherland is, however, rarely felt in his art. One is made acutely aware of an atmosphere reminiscent of Chicago and Paris. KƒÅrlis Padegs turned into a legend of Riga's artistic life. He was contemporary of the tempestuous JƒÅnis Tƒ´demanis (D≈æonis) who spent his formative years in Belgium and the barefooted tramp Irbƒ´te (pastel painter VoldemƒÅrs Irbe). Some Riga inhabitants will still recall KƒÅrlis Padegs as a most extravagant personality- his Spanish hat, a red scarf, a long black coat, pig-skin gloves, a bamboo cane, patent leather shoes and a white gaiters with little black buttons. The artist may be better remembered than his exhibitions held in quite untraditional premises (at cafe, in the street, in dancing halls) or in the show-windows of L.Kreicberga's photo salon that once even attracted the attention of the police. On November 26, 1938 KƒÅrlis Padegs marries Elvira Feodorovich. Padegs was a Riga dandy whose doings were described in newspapers and discussed in society and who obtrusively played up to the public before exhibitions. He once wrote in the newspaper that just this outsider who dreams about Narcissus and the perverse madonna does not forget the invalid. He shows him side by side with the fashionable Dorian Gray, the lover Don Juan, but why?- Because of sharp contrast, to make even the most dim-minded people understand that the world in World War I has already lost 12,996,117 people killed and 5,669,000 disabled people who have not died yet, and we do not want new victims. JƒÅnis Kalnaƒçs. KƒÅrlis Padegs Rƒ´ga. 1993.  Padegs art  The art of KƒÅrlis Padegs is essentially original. His works viewed at exhibitions in the mid-1930s did not seem to his contemporaries typical and symptomatic of Latvian art. They tried to trace the more likely sources of his outside influences- the Old Dutch masters, the Belgian F√©licien Rops, the Frenchman Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Henri Matisse, the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch and many more. In most cases the comparison was not too favourable. On the other hand, KƒÅrlis Padegs ranking among this illustrious galaxy of artists including many outstanding figures in art was most honourable and alluring.

File:Padegs morgue.jpgFive o'clock in the morgue (1935) File:Kabare.jpgCabaret (1935) File:Pavada.jpgFuneral of the unknown soldiers (1939) Since the exhibition mounted in 1933 KƒÅrlis Padegs art became an expression of unpleasant, even ugly traits opposed to the tendency towards beauty in Latvian art. Padegs once said: \\"I must often listen to reproaches- why do you draw such disgusting pictures when there is so much beauty in the world?- But there are also many abominable things and somebody must draw them too, I answer. I want to show the seamy side of life which we do not like to see in order not to spoil our feeling of comfort or our good appetite\\".JƒÅnis Kalnaƒçs. KƒÅrlis Padegs Rƒ´ga. 1993 Padegs deliberately strove to shock the morality of his contemporaries (as did avant-garde artists), to bewilder the upper and middle class by the squalid tragedy of the streets. His art was turned towards the derelicts of society- the city's poor, prostitutes, drunkards, cripples, debauches. He developed a kind of highly erotic traits, showed the seclusion of these people. His main contribution to this effect was The book for poor people representing with complete honesty urban life scenes. Even the female nude in KƒÅrlis Padegs paintings and drawings has nothing in common with attainable or worshipped beauty. Beauty is expressed in terms of exotic ever-refinement. His women's images incorporate sensual exposure of a prostitutes body and the divine mystery of a madonna. Padegs' famous Madonna with Machine Gun (1932). Padegs art came to full flower in a society of high development in art and thought. You will not find in his works traits of amazement. He was an artist with a strong ironical bent willing to combine hardly comparable things and by this method he achieved exceedingly sharp effects. In 1932 he painted his famous Madonna with a Machine-gun, a picture of a recognizable type as a foreboding of World War II. Padegs mind was absorbed with unconventional themes. Death was one of the most unpleasant subjects for the artist who suffered from tuberculosis for many years. In Latvian art Padegs stood apart as he did in everyday life. Defiant and rousing envy. His life was full of paradoxes. He had made his mark as a perfect Latvian draftsman when he took a new direction and graduated from the landscape studio at the Latvian Academy of arts thanks to the help of rector Vilhelms Purvƒ´tis, a landscapist of European fame in the early 20th. century. Padegs preferred themes were modern urban life, antiwar subjects, an idealised dream world and sarcastic self- portraits. His work was redolent with expressive distortion, refined features and sharp contrasts.  Padegs death and legacy  Commemorative plaque devoted to KƒÅrlis Padegs at Elizabete iela 24, Riga KƒÅrlis Padegs died in Riga, April 1940 from tuberculosis. He was 28 years old. He suffered from it all his life and after the very productive period in the 1939 he was so exhausted that his illness finally overcame the young painter. In later days he was nearly forgotten and only in the early 1980s marking the end of a period of general self- complacence did one of the most peculiar Latvian artists and his work became of current interest. Over this period a great many pieces of Padeg's heritage (mostly his earlier works) were lost. Some of them may in all probability be regained. He lived at Elizabete iela 24, where there is a plaque to his memory.

It is number 0 (referred to as \\"nothing\\" and not zero) on the Roll, and is reputed to be the oldest Lodge not only in Scotland, but the world. It is thus styled The Mother Lodge of Scotland attributing its origins to the 12th Century, and is often called Mother Kilwinning.  History  Legend has it that Kilwinning Abbey was built by stonemasons who had travelled from Europe and established a lodge there.. In 1599 William Schaw introduced the Second Schaw Statutes which specified that \\"ye warden of ye lug of Kilwynning\\" to \\"tak tryall of ye airt of memorie and science yrof, of everie fellowe of craft and everie prenteiss according to ayr of yr vocations\\".Second Schaw Statutes , 1599the Grand Lodge of Antient, Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland own original copies of the First and Second Schaw Statutes As early as the reign of James II, the lodge at Kilwinning was granting warrants for the formation of lodges elsewhere in Scotland such as, for example, Canongate Kilwinning, Greenock Kilwinning, and Cumberland Kilwinning. In 1736, the Grand Lodge of Scotland was organised and the Kilwinning lodge was one of its constituent lodges. That same year, it petitioned to be recognized as the oldest lodge in Scotland. However, as has happened so many times over Freemasonry's long history, the lodge's original records had been lost and the claim could not be proven. The petition was therefore rejected, wherefore Kilwinning seceded and again acted as a grand lodge, organising lodges in Scotland and on the continent, as well as in Virginia and Ireland. In 1807 Kilwinning \\"came once more into the bosom of the Grand Loge, bringing with her all of her daughter Lodges.\\"Albert G. Mackey, Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Vol. 1. The Masonic History Company, Chicago: 1946.  Provincial Grand Lodge of Kilwinning  Tradition demanded that whoever held the Mastery of the Mother Lodge would also be Provincial Grand Master of Ayrshire. As a result, many members transferred from other Lodges to Kilwinning. In 1983 this was changed; Mother Kilwinning was removed from the Province of Ayrshire and became subordinate to the Provincial Grand Lodge of Kilwinning. In consequence, the Lodge sends a representative to the Grand Lodge of Scotland to act as Grand Bible Bearer.  Degrees  The lodge awards the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry, namely: * Entered Apprentice * Fellow Craft * Master Mason In keeping with the traditions of Freemasonry in Scotland, a Craft Lodge may also confer the Order of Mark Masons Degree which, whilst a completion of the Fellow [of] Craft, is conferred after the Master Mason degree.

Lazear, Randall S. Kroszner, and Kevin M. Warsh, February 14, 2006, Volume 4, p. 35. is an American economist, the Morris Arnold and Nona Jean Cox Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and the Davies Family Professor of Economics at Stanford Graduate School of Business.http://www.hoover.org/profiles/edward-paul-lazear Lazear served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors from 2006 to 2009, replacing Ben Bernanke. As Chairman, he was the chief economic advisor to President George W. Bush holding a cabinet-level post as part of the White House team that led the response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Lazear has been called the founder of personnel economics a subfield of economics that applies economic models to the study of the management of human resources in the firm. His research advances new models of employee incentives, promotions, compensation and productivity in firms. He is also credited with developing a theory of entrepreneurship and leadership that emphasizes skill acquisition. In addition to personnel economics, Lazear is a labor economist known for his work on the educational production function, teaching to the test, and the importance of culture and language in explaining the rise of multiculturalism. Early life and education Born in 1948, Professor Lazear grew up in Brooklyn, New York before moving to Los Altos, California. He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with AB and AM degrees in 1971. He received his doctorate in economics from Harvard University in 1974. Career Edward Lazear is the Davies Family Professor of Economics at Stanford University since 2017 and Morris A. Cox Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution since 1985. Previously, he was the Jack Steele Parker Professor of Human Resources Management and Economics at the Stanford Graduate School of Business (1995-2017), and the Isidore Brown and Gladys J. Brown Professor of Urban and Labor Economics of the Graduate School of Business at the University of Chicago (1985-1992). He is the founding editor of the Journal of Labor Economics, the premier journal in labor economics, and the 15th ranked journal in economics. Lazear is also the founder of the Society of Labor Economists. Amongst various other appointments, Lazear also serves as a Research Fellow at the IZA Institute for the Study of Labor, the Center for Corporate Performance at the Copenhagen Business School, and SIEPR. Professor Lazear has also been a Research Associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research since 1974.

He has lectured by invitation at other premier institutions worldwide, including Norway, Finland, the Netherlands, England, Spain, Australia, and India. A frequent keynote speaker, he was the Astra- Erikkson Lecturer and the 1993 Wicksell Lecturer in Stockholm, Sweden. Since leaving his post as Chairman of the Bush Council of Economic Advisors, Lazear makes regular appearances on CNBC and Fox Business News. He is a frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages. Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors and the Financial Crisis Professor Lazear served as the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Financial Crisis and through the Great Recession of 2007-2009. As the chief economic advisor to President Bush, he joined the White House economic team that orchestrated the policy response to the financial crisis and that restructured the financial system. Lazear‚Äôs team developed the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 which provided the first rounds of economic stimuli intended to boost the United States economy in the face of unprecedented shocks to the financial and housing sectors. The bill was implemented rapidly: passing the U.S House of Representatives on January 29, 2008, and then the U.S Senate on February 7, 2008, to be signed into law on February 13, 2008 by President Bush with bi- partisan support. Prior to serving as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Lazear was a member of President Bush‚Äôs President's Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform, established in 2005. Lazear worked with nine other members on revenue-neutral policy options for reforming the Federal Internal Revenue Code. Awards and recognition Lazear has won a number of awards over his career.

It was discovered on 26 April 1993, by astronomers of the Spacewatch program at the Kitt Peak National Observatory in Tucson, Arizona. The dark and reddish minor planet is likely elongated and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after Nessus from Greek mythology.  Orbit and classification  Nessus is a centaur, a dynamically unstable population of minor planets between the classical asteroids and the trans- Neptunian objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 11.9‚Äì37.4 AU once every 122 years and 4 months (44,670 days; semi-major axis of 24.64 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.52 and an inclination of 16¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. At its perihelion (11.9 AU), it moves much closer to the Sun than Uranus (19.2 AU) but not as close as Saturn (9.6 AU), while at its aphelion (37.4 AU), it moves out well beyond the orbit of Neptune (30.1 AU). The orbits of centaurs are unstable due to perturbations by the giant planets. Nessus is an \\"SE object\\" because currently Saturn controls its perihelion and its aphelion is within the Kuiper belt. It is estimated to have a relatively long orbital half-life of about 4.9 million years. Fifty clones of the orbit of Nessus suggest that it will not pass within 1 AU (or 150 million kilometers) of any planet for at least 20,000 years.  Discovery and naming  Nessus was discovered by David Rabinowitz (not officially credited), working with the Spacewatch program, at Kitt Peak National Observatory on 26 April 1993. The discovery was announced on 13 May 1993 in an IAU Circular (IAUC 5789) of the Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams. It was the third discovery of a centaur after 2060 Chiron and 5145 Pholus, discovered by Charles Kowal and David Rabinowitz in 1977 and 1992, respectively. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Kitt Peak in April 1993. This minor planet was named after Nessus, a centaur from Greek mythology, who poisoned and was killed by the divine hero Heracles. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 22 April 1997 ().  Physical characteristics  Nessus has a very red color (RR), with a B‚ÄìR magnitude of 1.847 and 1.88, respectively. Color indices were also determined by Bauer (2003) and Hainaut (2002, 2012).  Rotation period  As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Nessus has been obtained from photometric observations. However, a brightness variation of 0.5 magnitude was measured in the 1990s, indicating that the body has a non-spherical, elongated shape. The body's rotation period and pole remain unknown.  Diameter and albedo  According to the Herschel Space Observatory with its PACS instrument, Nessus measures 57 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.086, while infrared observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope gave a diameter of 60 kilometers with an albedo of 0.065. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a carbonaceous standard albedo of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 68.48 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.55.

The weapon was developed by the design bureau of Motovilikha Plants, headed by F. F. Petrov, in the late 1930s, and was in production from 1939 to 1955. The M-30 saw action in World War II, mainly as a divisional artillery piece of the Red Army (RKKA). Captured guns were also employed later in the conflict by the German Wehrmacht and the Finnish Army. Post World War II the M-30 saw combat in numerous conflicts of the mid- to late twentieth century in service of other countries' armies, notably in the Middle East. Development In 1930 Red Army (RKKA) authorities started to look for a new divisional-level howitzer to replace the pre-World War I 122 mm howitzer M1909 and 122 mm howitzer M1910. Although both pieces were eventually modernized, resulting in the 122-mm howitzer M1909/37 and the 122-mm howitzer M1910/30 respectively, these upgrades did not address some shortcomings in the original designs. The first attempt to develop a new howitzer was made by the KB-2 design bureau under the supervision of German engineers. The design, known as Lubok, reached trials in 1932 and in 1934 was adopted as the 122-mm howitzer model 1934. It had a 23 caliber barrel, a maximum elevation of 50¬∞, traverse of 7¬∞, and a combat and travelling weight of 2,250 and 2,800 kg respectively. Like its predecessors, Lubok had a fixed trail carriage and although it was equipped with suspension, its wheels lacked tires, limiting towing speed to only 10 km/h. Nevertheless, it was undoubtfully superior to the M1910/30 which remained in production until 1941. However, after eight pieces were built in 1934‚Äì1935, production was stopped for unclear reasons, possibly relating to the disbanding of KB-2.Shirokorad A. B. ‚Äì Encyclopedia of Russian artillery. In the mid-1930s, the Main Artillery Directorate (GAU) considered a switch to 105 mm guns as used by some other armies. A smaller shell meant that the gun could be lighter and consequently more mobile. On the other hand, a 105 mm gun would also be less powerful. Moreover, there was no Russian or Soviet experience with 105 mm ammunition, while for the 122 mm the country already possessed both production lines and large numbers of already manufactured shells (however similar 107 mm manufacturing equipment and ammunition‚Äîfor the 107-mm gun M1910‚Äîwas available). Finally in 1937 the RKKA Head of General Staff I. I. Egorov supported retaining 122 mm ammunition.Shunkov V. N. The Weapons of the Red Army. Consequently, three howitzers were trialled in 1938‚Äì1939. The design bureau of UZTM (Ural Heavy Machinery Plant, Russian: –£—Ä–∞–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –ó–∞–≤–æ–¥ –¢—è–∂—ë–ª–æ–≥–æ –ú–∞—à–∏–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–µ–Ω–∏—è, –£–ó–¢–ú), which was ordered by GAU to design the new howitzer, developed a piece designated U-2. Similar projects were privately undertaken by the design bureaus of Motovilikha Plants, headed by F. F. Petrov (M-30), and by the No. 92 plant under V. G. Grabin (F-25). The U-2 (barrel length 21 calibers, chamber volume 3.0 litres, horizontal sliding breechblock from Lubok, muzzle brake, combat weight 2,030 kg) reached trials on 5 February 1939 and was rejected because of insufficient carriage strength and inferior ballistics. The F-25 project (barrel length 23 calibers, chamber volume 3.7 litres, horizontal sliding breechblock from Lubok, muzzle brake, combat weight 1,830 kg) was closed by GAU on 23 March 1939 as GAU considered it redundant to the M-30 which had reached trials earlier. The latter, after being returned several times for revision, was finally adopted in September 1939 as the 122 mm divisional howitzer M1938 (). Its GAU index number was 52-G-463.:ru:122-–º–º –≥–∞—É–±–∏—Ü–∞ –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–∞ 1938 –≥–æ–¥–∞ (–ú-30) M-30 versus F-25 A. B. Shirokorad, a well-known author of books detailing the history of the Soviet artillery, has claimed that the F-25 could have been developed into a better gun than the M-30. Grabin's design was about 400 kg lighter, had a greater traverse and had better ground clearance ‚Äì all this was achieved, according to Shirokorad, without sacrificing ballistics (same barrel length, chamber volume and muzzle length). Considering how long it took to finish the development of the M-30, the F-25's schedule possibly did not significantly lag behind. There is no official document explaining the advantages the M-30 had over the F-25. Factors that could have influenced the GAU decision were: * Unlike the F-25, the M-30 was not equipped with a muzzle brake. While softening recoil and thus allowing for a lighter carriage, the muzzle brake has a disadvantage of redirecting some of the gases that escape the barrel toward the ground where they raise dust, revealing the gun's position. Another side-effect of a muzzle brake is the increased muzzle blast behind the gun, adversely affecting the working conditions of its crew. * The M-30 used many elements from existing guns, most notably the interrupted-screw breechblock of the M1910/30. Since at that time Soviet industry had experienced major difficulties with manufacturing sliding breechblocks (as used by the F-25) for large caliber guns, the lowered technical risk can be considered a significant advantage. * The stronger carriage of the M-30 could be used ‚Äì and in fact was used ‚Äì for more powerful artillery pieces (see 152-mm howitzer M1943 (D-1)). Production Mass production of M-30 howitzers began in 1940 at Plant No. 92 in Gorky and No. 9 in Sverdlovsk. The former took part in the production of M-30s only in 1940, building a total of 500 pieces. In addition to towed howitzers, Plant No. 9 produced M-30S barrels for arming SU-122 assault guns. Some 700 barrels (including both serial-production and experimental articles) were manufactured for this purpose. Mass production continued into 1955. In 1950‚Äì1960, the M-30 was also produced by Huta Stalowa Wola in Poland where it was known as Wz.1938.Polish military equipment (1998) ‚Äì Information Office of the Ministry of Defence ‚Äì { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em; width:95%; background:#fff; border- collapse:collapse; border:1px solid #996; line-height:1.5; font-size:95%\\" - style=\\"vertical-align:top; text-align:center; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#996; color:#fff; font-weight:bold;\\"  colspan=\\"12\\" Production of –ú-30s, pcs. - style=\\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#ddb; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Year  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1940  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1941  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1942  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1943  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1944  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1945  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1946  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1947  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Total - style=\\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Produced, pcs.  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  639  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  2,762  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  4,240  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  3,770  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  3,485  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  2,630  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  210  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  200  rowspan=\\"3\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #996; vertical-align:middle\\"  19,266 - style=\\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; background-color:#ddb; text-align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Year  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1948  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1949  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1950  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1951  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1952  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1953  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1954  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  1955 - style=\\"vertical-align:top; border:1px solid #996; text- align:center;\\"  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  Produced, pcs.  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  200  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  250  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  ‚Äì  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  300  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  100  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  100  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  280  style=\\"border:1px solid #996\\"  100 } Description 1\\\\.

The barrel of the M-30 was of built-up construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and hydropneumatic recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire. The M-30 had a modern split trail carriage with leaf spring suspension and steel wheels with rubber tires. It was usually towed by vehicle without a limber. The carriage allowed for a towing speed of up to 50 km/h on paved road and up to 35 km/h on gravel or dirt roads, although the gun could also be moved by a team of six horses, in which case a limber was used. When the trails were swung open the suspension locked automatically . In an emergency it was possible to shoot in a \\"single trail\\" mode, at the price of a drastically reduced traverse (1¬∞30'). The time required to set the gun up for combat was about 1‚Äì1.5 minutes. The carriage of the M-30 was later used for the D-1 152 mm howitzer.  Organization and employment  M-30 in Sevastopol.

According to the organization of 1939, each rifle division had two artillery regiments; one light regiment (a battalion of 76 mm guns; two mixed battalions with one battery of 76 mm guns and two batteries of 122 mm howitzers) and one howitzer regiment (a battalion of 122 mm howitzers and a battalion of 152 mm howitzers), giving 28 122 mm howitzers per division. In June 1940 one more battalion of 122 mm howitzers was added to the howitzer regiment, bringing the number of guns in each unit to 32. In June 1941 the howitzer regiment was removed and the number of howitzers dropped to 16. This organization was used throughout the war, except in Russian Guards rifle divisions which from December 1942 had three artillery battalions (two batteries of 76 mm guns and one battery of 122 mm howitzers each), totaling 12 howitzers. From December 1944 they received an extra howitzer regiment (5 batteries, 20 howitzers) and from June 1945 rifle divisions were reorganized identically. Mountain rifle divisions in 1939‚Äì1940 had one battalion of 122 mm howitzers (3 batteries, 9 guns). From 1941 they received instead one artillery regiment (2 battalions, each from 3 four-gun batteries) with 24 howitzers, but in early 1942 only one battalion (2 batteries, 8 howitzers) remained. From 1944 howitzers were removed from mountain rifle divisions. Motorized divisions had two mixed battalions (a battery of 76 mm guns and two batteries of 122 mm howitzers), totaling 12 howitzers. Tank divisions had one battalion with 12 howitzers. Cavalry divisions until August 1941 had two batteries of 122 mm howitzers, totaling eight, before the divisional artillery was removed. Until late 1941 rifle brigades had a battery of four 122 mm howitzers. 122 mm howitzers were also used by the howitzer brigades of the Reserve of the Main Command (72‚Äì84 pieces). By 1 June 1941 1,667 M-30s were in service, comprising only a fraction of the RKKA divisional howitzers. As the war progressed, their share grew rapidly due to mass production and because many older guns were lost in combat in 1941‚Äì42. M-30 howitzers were primarily employed for indirect fire against enemy personnel. They were also used against field fortifications, for clearing minefields and for breaching barbed wire. Their HE-fragmentation shells presented a danger to armoured vehicles. Fragments created by the explosion could penetrate up to 20 mm of armour, ‚Äì enough against thinly armoured vehicles. The shells could also damage chassis, sights or other elements of heavier armoured vehicles. For self-defense against enemy tanks a HEAT shell was developed in 1943. Before 1943, crews were required to rely on the high-explosive action of their regular ammunition, with some degree of success. According to a German report from 1943, even a Tiger was once heavily damaged by SU-122 assault guns firing high-explosive shells.SU-122 Assault Gun at \\"The Russian Battelfield\\". M-30 howitzers were towed by a variety of means, from horses, oxenPetr Mikhin; Guns Against the Reich; Pen and Sword Books, Ltd.; Barnsley, UK; 2010; pp 51‚Äì54 and both Soviet and American-produced Lend- Lease trucks (such as the Dodge WC series and Studebaker US6s) and Stalinets STZ-5 and Ya-12 purpose-built artillery tractors. When necessary, the gun could be manhandled by its artillery crew. The gun was eventually replaced by the 122-mm howitzer D-30 after the latter was adopted for service in 1960. A small number of operational M-30 howitzers are still present in Russian Army ordnance depots. They are being gradually withdrawn from reserve. M-30s featured in many Soviet movies used for novice artillery crew training. These movies were made in the 1960s when more modern D-30 howitzers were becoming available, however the M-30 was considered by authorities as much more suitable for training purposes. The movies are still in use despite the absence of M-30 howitzers even in practice exercises. Other operators A large number of M-30s fell into the hands of the Wehrmacht in 1941‚Äì1942 and were adopted as 12,2 cm s.F.H.396(r) heavy howitzers. Germany began mass production of 122 mm ammunition for these and other captured howitzers, producing 424,000 shells in 1943, 696,700 in 1944 and 133,000 in 1945. Some captured M-30s were used in the Atlantic Wall fortifications.Shirokorad A. B. ‚Äì The God of War of The Third Reich. The Finnish Army captured 41 guns of the type and adopted them as the 122 H 38. These guns fired 13,298 shells in combat; only a few pieces were lost. The gun was well liked; some were used for training or stored in depots until the mid-1980s.122 H/38 at \\"Jaeger Platoon: Finnish Army 1918 ‚Äì 1945 Website\\". The Kingdom of Romania captured in 1941 a number of 477 various types of 122 mm howitzers and guns including M1931/37 and were used as divisional artillery for units rebuilt in 1943. After World War II the gun was supplied to many countries around the globe. With the Egyptian and Syrian armies it saw action in the Arab-Israeli Wars. Some of these guns were captured by Israel, although it is unclear whether they were ever employed by the Israeli Defense Forces. The People's Republic of China organized their own production of M-30 howitzers under the Type 54 designation.Jane's Armour and Artillery, 2003‚Äì2004 According to Ian V. Hogg, the M1938 howitzer \\"must, surely, be the most prolific piece of artillery in history\\".Ian V.

Self-propelled mounts SU-122 assault gun. former Soviet Union The M-30 was mounted on the following armoured fighting vehicles (AFV): * SU-122, the Soviet medium assault gun built on a T-34 chassis. The mass production continued from December 1942 until September 1943. In total 638 SU-122s were built. * SG-122, Soviet self-propelled artillery vehicles based on captured German Pz Kpfw III or StuG III AFVs. About twenty were built in the early months of 1943. * 12,2-cm Kanone (r) auf Gesch√ºtzwagen Lorraine- Shlepper (f), the German self-propelled artillery vehicle, based on a captured armoured French artillery tractor (the Lorraine 37L). There was at least one vehicle of this type, which fought in France on a railroad car as part of a German armoured train.12,2-cm Kanone (r) auf Gesch√ºtzwagen Lorraine-Shlepper (f) at \\"Ostpanzer\\". People's Republic of China * Type WZ302 ‚Äì Combination of the Type 54 or Type 54-1 with a tracked vehicle Type B531. The military designator is Type 70 SPH. The initial model had only 4 roadwheels, but the improved Type WZ302A or Type 70-1 has 5. The final production model with new signals equipment is known as Type WZ302B or Type 70-2. All models have a basic load of 40 rounds of 122mm. Summary In the M-30, RKKA units finally received a modern divisional howitzer which successfully combined increased firepower and better mobility with reliability and ease of use. A summary of its employment by the Red Army was provided by Marshal G. F. Odintsov, who said \\"Nothing can be better\\". The long post-war employment of the howitzer is additional testimony to its combat and operational utility and effectiveness. It is hard to compare the M-30 directly with contemporary foreign guns since the artillery of France, Germany and United States employed in similar roles was either the much smaller 105 mm (Great Britain used the even smaller‚Äî87.6 mm‚Äî25 pounder gun-howitzer) or much larger 150 to 155 mm caliber guns. Howitzers of similar calibers existed but most of those were World War I era pieces, such as the Vickers 114 mm howitzer used by the Finnish Army. Naturally, 150 mm howitzers were more powerful, but much heavier than the M-30; while 105 mm pieces were lighter but their smaller shells contained less explosive. The most direct German equivalent was the 10.5 cm leFH 18 light howitzer. Weighing 1985 kg, it had a maximum elevation of 42¬∞, muzzle velocity of 470 m/s and maximum range of 10,675 m. In the upgraded leFH 18/40 version, muzzle velocity was improved to 540 m/—Å, elevation to 45¬∞ and range to 12,325 m. About equal in range, the German howitzer had a less powerful HE shell and its smaller maximum elevation made it less effective against dug-in troops, although it also weighed some 400 kg less than M-30. Both guns were well suited for mass production with 16.887 M-30s and 15.388 leFH 18 built in 1941‚Äì45. Ammunition data The M-30 could fire all types of 122 mm howitzer ammunition used by the RKKA, including old Russian and imported shells. During and after World War II new types of ammunition were developed, notably HEAT shells. The World War II era HEAT shell BP-460A could pierce 100‚Äì160 mm of armor at 90¬∞; the post-war BP-1 managed 200 mm at 90¬∞, 160 mm at 60¬∞, and 80 mm at 30¬∞. HE-Frag projectiles of type OF-462 that were initially developed for the M-30 howitzer can be fired from modern 122 mm ordnance pieces and are still in Russian Army service. { border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 style=\\"margin:0 0 .5em 1em;

Matrix representation of a relation If R is a binary relation between the finite indexed sets X and Y (so ), then R can be represented by the logical matrix M whose row and column indices index the elements of X and Y, respectively, such that the entries of M are defined by: :M_{i,j} = \\\\begin{cases} 1 & (x_i, y_j) \\\\in R \\\\ 0 & (x_i, y_j) ot\\\\in R \\\\end{cases} In order to designate the row and column numbers of the matrix, the sets X and Y are indexed with positive integers: i ranges from 1 to the cardinality (size) of X and j ranges from 1 to the cardinality of Y. See the entry on indexed sets for more detail. Example The binary relation R on the set } is defined so that aRb holds if and only if a divides b evenly, with no remainder. For example, 2R4 holds because 2 divides 4 without leaving a remainder, but 3R4 does not hold because when 3 divides 4 there is a remainder of 1. The following set is the set of pairs for which the relation R holds. :{(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 2), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 4)}. The corresponding representation as a logical matrix is: :\\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\end{pmatrix} which includes a diagonal of ones since each number divides itself. Other examples * A permutation matrix is a (0,1)-matrix, all of whose columns and rows each have exactly one nonzero element. ** A Costas array is a special case of a permutation matrix * An incidence matrix in combinatorics and finite geometry has ones to indicate incidence between points (or vertices) and lines of a geometry, blocks of a block design, or edges of a graph (discrete mathematics) * A design matrix in analysis of variance is a (0,1)-matrix with constant row sums. * A logical matrix may represent an adjacency matrix in graph theory: non-symmetric matrices correspond to directed graphs, symmetric matrices to ordinary graphs, and a 1 on the diagonal corresponds to a loop at the corresponding vertex. * The biadjacency matrix of a simple, undirected bipartite graph is a (0,1)-matrix, and any (0,1)-matrix arises in this way. * The prime factors of a list of m square-free, n-smooth numbers can be described as a m√óœÄ(n) (0,1)-matrix, where œÄ is the prime-counting function and aij is 1 if and only if the jth prime divides the ith number. This representation is useful in the quadratic sieve factoring algorithm. *A bitmap image containing pixels in only two colors can be represented as a (0,1)-matrix in which the 0's represent pixels of one color and the 1's represent pixels of the other color. * A binary matrix can be used to check the game rules in the game of Go Some properties The matrix representation of the equality relation on a finite set is the identity matrix I, that is, the matrix whose entries on the diagonal are all 1, while the others are all 0. More generally, if relation R satisfies I ‚äÇ R, then R is a reflexive relation. If the Boolean domain is viewed as a semiring, where addition corresponds to logical OR and multiplication to logical AND, the matrix representation of the composition of two relations is equal to the matrix product of the matrix representations of these relations. This product can be computed in expected time O(n2). -- The algorithm relies on addition being idempotent, cf. p.134 (bottom). Frequently operations on binary matrices are defined in terms of modular arithmetic mod 2 --that is, the elements are treated as elements of the Galois field . They arise in a variety of representations and have a number of more restricted special forms. They are applied e.g. in XOR-satisfiability. The number of distinct m-by-n binary matrices is equal to 2mn, and is thus finite. Lattice Let n and m be given and let U denote the set of all logical m √ó n matrices. Then U has a partial order given by :m \\\\subset n \\\\quad \\\\text{when} \\\\quad \\\\forall i,j \\\\quad m_{ij} = 1 \\\\implies n_{ij} = 1 . In fact, U forms a Boolean algebra with the operations and & or between two matrices applied component-wise. The complement of a logical matrix is obtained by swapping all zeros and ones for their opposite. Every logical matrix a = ( a i j ) has an transpose aT = ( a j i ). Suppose a is a logical matrix with no columns or rows identically zero. Then the matrix product, using Boolean arithmetic, aT a contains the m √ó m identity matrix, and the product a aT contains the n √ó n identity. As a mathematical structure, the Boolean algebra U forms a lattice ordered by inclusion; additionally it is a multiplicative lattice due to matrix multiplication. Every logical matrix in U corresponds to a binary relation. These listed operations on U, and ordering, correspond to a calculus of relations, where the matrix multiplication represents composition of relations.Irving Copilowish (December 1948). \\"Matrix development of the calculus of relations\\", Journal of Symbolic Logic 13(4): 193‚Äì203 Jstor link Logical vectors If m or n equals one, then the m √ó n logical matrix (Mi j) is a logical vector. If m = 1 the vector is a row vector, and if n = 1 it is a column vector. In either case the index equaling one is dropped from denotation of the vector. Suppose (P_i), \\\\quad i = 1, 2,... m \\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{and}\\\\ \\\\ (Q_j), \\\\quad j = 1,2,... n are two logical vectors. The outer product of P and Q results in an m √ó n rectangular relation: :M_{i j} = P_i \\\\land Q_j . A re-ordering of the rows and columns of such a matrix can assemble all the ones into a rectangular part of the matrix. Let h be the vector of all ones. Then if v is an arbitrary logical vector, the relation R = v hT has constant rows determined by v. In the calculus of relations such an R is called a vector. A particular instance is the universal relation h hT. For a given relation R, a maximal, rectangular relation contained in R is called a concept in R. Relations may be studied by decomposing into concepts, and then noting the induced concept lattice. Consider the table of group-like structures, where \\"unneeded\\" can be denoted 0, and \\"required\\" denoted by 1, forming a logical matrix R. To calculate elements of R RT it is necessary to use the logical inner product of pairs of logical vectors in rows of this matrix. If this inner product is 0, then the rows are orthogonal. In fact, semigroup is orthogonal to loop, small category is orthogonal to quasigroup, and groupoid is orthogonal to magma. Consequently there are 0's in R RT and it fails to be a universal relation. Row and column sums Adding up all the 1‚Äôs in a logical matrix may be accomplished in two ways, first summing the rows or first summing the columns. When the row-sums are added, the sum is the same as when the column-sums are added. In incidence geometry, the matrix is interpreted as an incidence matrix with the rows corresponding to \\"points\\" and the columns as \\"blocks\\" (generalizing lines made of points). A row-sum is called its point degree and a column-sum is the block degree. Proposition 1.6 in Design Theory. 2nd ed. (1999) says that the sum of point degrees equals the sum of block degrees. An early problem in the area was \\"to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an incidence structure with given point degrees and block degrees (or in matrix language, for the existence of a (0,1)-matrix of type v √ó b with given row and column sums.\\" Such a structure is a block design.

He was the vice-presidential nominee in 1984 of the short-lived Citizens Party; Sonia Johnson was the party's presidential nominee that year. Personal life and education Richard John Walton was born on May 24, 1928 in Saratoga Springs, New York, to Gertrude and Richard James Walton. As a child he moved with his family to Providence, Rhode Island, where he was graduated from Classical High School in 1945 and received a bachelor's degree from Brown University in 1951. His studies at Brown were interrupted for two years while he served in the U.S. Navy as a journalist's mate. He worked as a disc jockey on Providence radio station WICE before attending the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism where he received a master's degree in 1954. He was married twice, once to Margaret Hilton and subsequently to Mary Una Jones; both marriages ended in divorce. He has two children, Richard (born 1958) and Catherine (born 1960). He returned to reside in his home state of Rhode Island since 1981. Walton died at age 84 of leukemia on December 27, 2012, at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, RI. Journalistic career As a print journalist, he worked for The Providence Journal (1954-1955) and then for the New York World-Telegram and The New York Sun (1955-1959). He then returned to radio for the Voice of America (VOA), first in Washington, D.C. as producer- host of Report to Africa (1959-1962) and then in New York City as principal United Nations correspondent (1962-1967). In 1960, he traveled extensively in Africa making a series of documentaries on the independence movement, interviewing many of the post-colonial leaders including Patrice Lumumba. In 1967 he left VOA to write his first book, The Remnants of Power: The Tragic Last Years of Adlai Stevenson (1968). Eleven other books followed, notably America and the Cold War (1969), The United States and Latin America (1971, ), Cold War and Counterrevolution: The Foreign Policy of John F. Kennedy (1972, ), Henry Wallace, Harry Truman and the Cold War (1976, ), The Power of Oil (1979, ), and The United States and the Far East (1979, ). He has contributed articles to numerous publications, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Nation, The New Republic, Saturday Review, Cosmopolitan, and Playboy. He was an early member of the National Book Critics Circle. Teaching career After leaving the VOA in 1967, Walton began teaching writing, political science, and history at Housatonic Community College in Stratford, CT, The New School for Social Research in New York City, and what is now Western Connecticut State University in Danbury, CT. He traveled to more than 50 countries, including teaching English in an elementary school in Shanghai in the summer of 2007. For over a quarter of a century until 2012, he taught at Rhode Island College where he was among the leaders of a campaign to unionize adjunct faculty. In an election in April 2007, the adjunct faculty voted by an overwhelming margin to unionize and affiliate with the American Federation of Teachers. He served on the union's negotiating committee, agreeing an initial contract with the college and Rhode Island Board of Governors for Higher Education, which was ratified in October 2009. He was elected as the union's first president and served until his death. Rhode Island College lowered its flag to half-staff in his memory. In May 2013, the college honored Walton with the Special Award for Distinguished Service to Alumni, in Memoriam. Political and community activism Involved from 1980 with the Citizens Party of environmentalist Barry Commoner, Walton was the party's vice-presidential candidate in 1984 on a ticket headed by feminist Sonia Johnson as the party's presidential candidate. (Johnson's running mate on the Peace and Freedom Party ticket that year was Emma Wong Mar, however). Walton had been interested in political third parties since at least the publication of his book on the subject, Henry Wallace, Harry Truman and the Cold War. Interviewed in 2008, Walton joked about his 1984 campaign for vice- president, \\"I don't think I attracted quite as much attention as Sarah Palin.\\" He went on to become one of the early members of the Green Party of Rhode Island. In the 1996 Presidential election in Rhode Island he was temporarily a stand-in candidate for Ralph Nader's official running mate Winona LaDuke. In the 2004 Presidential election, he endorsed Green Party presidential candidate David Cobb. He served on several national Green bodies. Walton became well known as an activist against poverty, homelessness, and hunger. He served as president of Amos House, which is the state's largest soup kitchen, and on the boards of a number of non-profit and social service organizations, including the George Wiley Center (advocates for the poor), the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless, and the Slater Mill Historic Site. With the Providence- Niquinohomo Sister City Project he had been to Nicaragua many times where the project built a health center and a school, and he twice served on medical teams in Guatemala. Every year for his own birthday from 1988 to 2011, Walton hosted a substantial charitable fundraiser at his home that was typically attended by several hundred people, including sitting and former governors, senators, congressional representatives, and media personalities who were in some cases his former students. The party was held for the first time at another venue in 2012. Walton has received the Sister Carol McGovern Award of the Rhode Island Coalition for the Homeless for his work with the homeless and the John Kiffney Award of the Providence Newspaper Guild for his service to the community. Involved with the non-profit folk music venue Stone Soup Coffee House for 30 years, he was the first president of its parent organization, the Stone Soup Folk Arts Foundation, and served for 15 years. After a hiatus of many years, he had been returned to office and was serving as president at the time of his death. In April 2016 Walton was posthumously inducted into the Rhode Island Music Hall of Fame (RIMHOF). In 2008 at the age of 80, Walton was profiled and interviewed as part of a major feature article in The Providence Phoenix about prominent people in Rhode Island. In 2018 an e-book of selected correspondence by Walton was edited by Herbert Weiss & Nancy Carriuolo and published to commemorate Walton's life and activism.

It can be found floating in ponds, and often forms thick mats on and under the water surface. It normally grows quickly at the surface. When kept about two to three inches below an ordinary fluorescent bulb or in a pond exposed to full sunlight, it will form dense, bright green mats. Any single branch or antler bud can reproduce into a large colony if the plant is kept in proper conditions. It normally floats, but can also be attached to underwater objects such as logs and rocks. It can be attached with plastic mesh. Floating crystalwort is generally not compatible with duckweeds, as they cover the surface of the water quite rapidly, crowding the Riccia out. It is also easily overtaken by hair algae. The species epithet fluitans is Latin for floating.Archibald William Smith  References  External links  * Care information for Riccia Fluitans * AquaHobby * Krib discussions * Natural Aquariums Category:Ricciaceae ","title":"Riccia fluitans"},{"id":"4109239","text":"With You in Mind is Alma Cogan's second album, issued in 1961.

The highway extends from Pennsville-Salem Road (Route 49) in Pennsville Township to Penn Street (Interstate 676 / U.S. Route 30) in Camden. Route description View south (signed as west) along CR 551 just southwest of CR 641 in Carneys Point Township CR 551 begins at an intersection with Route 49 in Pennsville Township, Salem County, heading north on two-lane undivided Hook Road. The road runs through a mix of farms and woods with some homes. The route passes through some marshland adjacent to the Salem River before entering residential areas. CR 551 crosses into Carneys Point Township and comes to an interchange with I-295 at the point where the New Jersey Turnpike and US 40 split from I-295. Here, CR 551 briefly merges onto I-295 before exiting the freeway at Route 140, at which point the route heads east for a brief concurrency with Route 140 in commercial areas. CR 551 splits from Route 140 by heading northeast on two-lane undivided Auburn Road, running through forested areas a short distance to the east of I-295, intersecting CR 618. The route turns east away from I-295 and intersects CR 629 as it passes to the north of a lake before coming to a junction with Route 48. Following this intersection, the road heads into a mix of farmland and woodland with a few homes, entering Oldmans Township at the CR 641 junction. The road comes to intersections with CR 643 and CR 644 before crossing CR 602 farther east. Upon intersecting CR 646, CR 551 turns northeast onto Pointers Auburn Road and passes homes. CR 551 southbound at I-295 in Deptford Township Upon crossing the marshy Oldmans Creek, CR 551 enters Woolwich Township in Gloucester County and becomes Auburn Road as it passes residential subdivisions before crossing CR 602 and heading into agricultural areas. The road enters areas of residential development again as it intersects CR 620 and CR 662. After crossing the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Salem Branch line, the route continues into Swedesboro and becomes Auburn Avenue. The road is lined with homes as it meets CR 671 before coming to a junction with CR 605 and CR 694. At this intersection, CR 551 turns onto Kings Highway and passes through the residential and commercial downtown of Swedesboro, reaching the junction with the western terminus of CR 538. The route crosses the Racoon Creek back into Woolwich Township and intersects CR 653 before passing a mix of farms and development as it comes to US 322/CR 536. CR 551 continues through more agricultural areas as it has junctions with CR 672 and CR 684. Continuing into East Greenwich Township, the route heads into areas of residential subdivisions as it crosses CR 607 and CR 664. After passing through some woods, the road heads into the residential community of Mickleton and intersects CR 673. In the community of Clarksboro, CR 551 reaches junctions with CR 667 and CR 707. The route crosses the Southern Railroad of New Jersey's Salem Branch before passing more homes in the community of Mount Royal, where there is an intersection with CR 678. CR 551 crosses the Mantua Creek into West Deptford Township and heads east between oil tanks to the north and residential areas to the south as it intersects CR 648, CR 643, and CR 656. The road continues near more homes and tank farms before crossing CR 660, where the setting becomes mainly residential. CR 551 enters Woodbury and becomes Salem Avenue as it enters commercial areas, crossing Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Penns Grove Secondary before reaching an intersection with Route 45. Here, CR 551 forms a concurrency with four-lane Route 45 and heads north-northeast on Broad Street through the downtown of Woodbury. The road intersects CR 663 and continues through the downtown. Route 45 and CR 551 cross the Woodbury Creek out of the downtown area and intersect CR 644 near Inspira Medical Center Woodbury. From here, the route continues past a mix of residences and businesses as a two-lane undivided road. CR 551 splits from Route 45 by heading east on Park Avenue, crossing the Conrail Shared Assets Operations' Vineland Secondary before turning north on Broadway, entering Deptford Township. The road runs through commercial areas and intersects the northern terminus of CR 553. Farther north, CR 551 reaches a partial interchange with access to and from the northbound direction of I-295; southbound access is provided by Route 45 a short distance to the west. In the area of this interchange, the route is briefly a divided highway. Past I-295, the route continues into Westville and passes through more urban areas of homes and businesses as a two-lane undivided road. CR 551 passes through the commercial downtown of Westville before joining Route 47, running northeast through commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road. After crossing the Big Timber Creek into Brooklawn, Camden County, the road comes to a traffic circle with US 130 and CR 753, where Route 47 ends and CR 551 turns west to follow US 130, passing under the Vineland Secondary.

The route continues north onto Broadway and crosses a railroad branch before passing through urban areas of homes and businesses, intersecting CR 632, CR 634, CR 635, and CR 755. CR 551 passes under the Walt Whitman Bridge, which carries I-76, before coming to a junction with CR 631 in an industrial area. The road crosses the Newton Creek into Camden and passes to the east of the Port of Camden. After passing over a railroad branch, the route passes rowhomes as it crosses CR 603. The road passes more urban development as it reaches junctions with CR 607 and CR 604. CR 551 continues north into the commercial downtown of Camden and crosses Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and NJ Transit's River Line near the Walter Rand Transportation Center before intersecting CR 537 and CR 537 Spur. CR 551 comes to its northern terminus at an interchange with I-676/US 30 near the toll plaza on the eastern approach of the Benjamin Franklin Bridge to Philadelphia.  History  In 1681, the West Jersey legislature approved the laying out of a road from Amboy to Salem through Bordentown, Burlington, Mount Holly, Moorestown, and Haddonfield, along an old Lenape trail. It became known as a King's Highway, and was an important route of travel between the capitals of East and West Jersey. From South Amboy to Cranbury, the road followed Bordentown Avenue, Main Street, and County Route 535, then into Hightstown as Main Street. From there, the road is still known as the Old York Road to Burlington, barring a small section south of Crosswicks known as the Crosswicks-Chesterfield Road. From Mount Holly to Moorestown, the road is now known as the Marne Highway. From there to Salem, the road is still known as King's Highway, with the section surrounding Camden designated Route 41; from there to Brooklawn it's now designated CR 551 Spur, and CR 551 to Swedesboro. The road was straightened to its present course in 1812. The road had many name changes; the road west of Moorestown wasn't unified under the name \\"King's Highway\\" until 1963. From Woodbury to Swedesboro, the road was maintained as part of the Salem and Gloucester Turnpike; the road from Swedesboro to Woodstown was also included in the turnpike.

In spite of its benefits to power, torque and economy, the JTS was not used in the smaller 147 or the larger 166, and much less in other models from the Fiat Group.

It was serialized in Big Comic Superior from 1990 to 1995, then released into 12 volumes by Shogakukan. It was published as 46 comic books and collected as nine volumes in America by Viz Graphics from 1995 to 1997. Sanctuary was a bestseller in Japan, and inspired an anime OVA and a series of live action films.  Plot  Sanctuary is a story that featured two childhood friends, Akira Hojo and Chiaki Asami, who are ruthlessly struggling to set a new paradigm of living in Japan. However, the two friends took radically different paths (playing rock-paper-scissors to decide their roles): Akira chose the dark path and joined a Yakuza gang, while Chiaki strived to become the youngest member of the Japanese Diet. As survivors of the Cambodian killing fields, the two characters developed an unmatched aggression and survival instincts, helping them to achieve their common ultimate goal: making Japan their own sanctuary. The story starts with Hojo as a minor mob boss and Asami as a political advisor. The plot first focuses on their rise to positions of greater power. Hojo's rise is decidedly quicker than Asami's, whose struggle to get to the top lasts the entire manga. Hojo is a Yakuza Don by book 2. The story then follows his attempts to gain control over the entire Yakuza while secretly paving the way for them to become a legitimate enterprise. Asami, meanwhile, must try to enter the Diet by forming his own party that represents the younger people of Japan. He is constantly opposed by the current Dietmen, who are aging politicians intent on holding onto power (often considered to be a thinly-veiled reference to the Liberal Democratic Party). By the end of the series, both Hojo and Asami succeeded in their ambitions. Hojo successfully united all of the major Yakuzas under his banner to extend the longevity of Yakuza (through educational reform) while Asami successfully became the youngest nominated politician to become Prime Minister of Japan. At the end of their journey, they returned to where it all began, Cambodia. Unfortunately, Asami died due to illness.  Characters  ; : :Portrayed by: Toshiya Nakasawa :Don of the .

In 1997, he won the Sports Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2000 he was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame. Career Jim Simpson was born in Washington, D.C., and grew up in nearby Chevy Chase, Md. He began his broadcasting career with a short-lived radio show, Hunting and Fishing With Jimmy Simpson, when he was 15. He attended George Washington University in Washington and served in the Coast Guard and Navy Reserve. After several jobs in radio, he began working in television in Washington in 1949. In the early 1950s, he shared a half-hour news program at Washington's WTOP-TV with another TV newcomer, Walter Cronkite, the future anchor of the CBS Evening News. He joined NBC's owned- and-operated Washington station, WRC-TV, in 1955. Simpson broadcast Atlantic Coast Conference basketball games in the early 1960s and worked as a sports reporter at WRC-TV. NBC Sports Eventually he would broadcast many sports at NBC, including football, basketball, baseball, tennis, and golf. For much of the 1960s and 1970s he was generally considered the network's number two play-by-play announcer, behind only Curt Gowdy. He was in New Haven, Connecticut on November 22, 1963 to do the annual Harvard-Yale football game with Lindsey Nelson and Terry Brennan, when word came of the assassination of John F. Kennedy. Simpson was quoted as saying to Nelson as they walked through the tunnel of the Yale Bowl, \\"We will remember this walk and this moment for a long, long, time.\\" His work on American Football League (and later American Football Conference) telecasts for NBC is perhaps what he is best remembered for. In 1966, Simpson and Bill Cullen (who at the time, along with Simpson hosted a sports anthology series called NBC Sports in Action), were the between-periods co-hosts for NBC's Stanley Cup Finals broadcasts. It marked the first time that the Stanley Cup Finals were broadcast on American network television. It was also the first time that hockey games were broadcast on network television in color. The CBC would follow suit the following year. On January 15, 1967, Simpson (along with former quarterback George Ratterman) called Super Bowl I for NBC Radio. He also called several World Series for NBC Radio, as well as numerous Orange Bowl games, the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final (via tape delay), and several Olympic Games for NBC television. ESPN In 1979, after Week 2 of the NFL season, the fledgling ESPN cable sports network brought Simpson on board to provide some needed credibility with sports fans. Simpson broadcast the first NCAA basketball game the network televised, with flamboyant Dick Vitale as the color man. Vitale credits Simpson with helping him develop as a sportscaster. Simpson also called USFL, NBA, college football, and College World Series games for ESPN, in 1988 called the Baltimore Orioles' local telecasts on WMAR-TV (the NBC affiliate at the time), and called figure skating at the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics for TNT. After his sportscasting days Simpson retired to St. Croix, Virgin Islands. Among other firsts he was the initial U.S. sportscaster to appear live via satellite from Asia, and he was involved in the first American sportscast using instant replay technology. In 2005, ESPN brought Simpson back from retirement to do play-by-play for a series of college basketball games in a \\"turn back the clock\\" format on the ESPN Classic network. He died on January 13, 2016, in Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 88.

It is named for Saint Aloysius Gonzaga. Highly ranked academically, it is considered one of the most prestigious boarding schools in Germany. Since early 2010 the school has been investigated for cases of child abuse.  Organization  Since 1921 the Jesuits have operated a boarding school for boys in Bonn Bad-Godesberg. Ninety-four percent of its budget is provided by German North Rhine-Westphalia, even though the college is non-governmental, run by the Jesuits. The remaining 6% is covered by the Archdiocese of Cologne. The school is open to everyone. The State conducts the school-leaving examination (called the Abitur, the equivalent of A-levels in the UK) and proposes the subjects of instruction. In turn, the school is recognized by the State, and a successfully completed Abitur by any graduate allows admission to a German university. Lodging, food, and boarding run about ‚Ç¨14,000 per year, while students from impoverished families are sponsored by the Jesuits or by the charge for other boarders.  School competitions  The Aloisiuskolleg (AKO) ranks high each year at regional, national, and even international school competitions in sports, as well as in subjects like physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, music, art, and computer sciences, and has won several awards. A PISA study ranked the school 4th in Germany and among the best in Europe. Also in other OECD studies the school is usually ranked highly.  International co-operation  The College attaches importance to international contacts, and has promoted cultural exchange with other countries since its founding. Since 1997 this has included the European Union's COMENIUS program which promotes co-operation among European schools. Partnerships exist with Clongowes Wood College (Ireland), Eton College and Maidenhead (both in England), and Georgetown Prep in Washington, D.C., United States.  History = Establishment  As a consequence of the Kulturkampf, the State of Prussia took over by law the supervision of all Jesuit schools in 1872. On 12 August 1900 the German province of the Society of Jesus opened the Aloisiuskolleg in Sittard, Netherlands, as an all-boys school with boarding facilities. This started with German nationals, 43 internal and 38 external pupils on 29 September 1900 with a pre-class and 5th and 6th grades. This was the beginning of the Aloisiuskollegs. Move to Bonn Bad-Godesberg; Nazi period The law against Jesuits (\\"Jesuitengesetz\\") was repealed in 1917 and new schools opened again in Germany. The Aloisiuskolleg moved to Bonn in 1921. In 1927 the Jesuits also acquired a nearby villa owned by the banker August Karl Baron von der Heydt, son of August von der Heydt, and turned it into \\"Stella Rheni\\", a boys' home. During the Nazi period, the school and the Jesuits opposed the regime and the school was closed in 1938. The active resistance by the Jesuits and the pupils plays an important role in the contemporary self-understanding of the College. Well-known resistors to the Nazis were Georg Freiherr von Boeselager and his brother Philipp. The Jesuits reopened the Aloisiuskolleg in 1946, after the end of World War II.  Abuse of pupils From early 2010 the school was at the centre of investigations into the abuse of pupils, resulting in the resignation of Chairman Theo Schneider who was accused of complicity. The progress report by the commission investigating cases of abuse counted 45 victims and 18 perpetrators, 15 of whom were members of the Jesuit order, since the 1950s. The interim report highlighted the \\"latent psychological violence\\" in the punishment methods, the compulsive exhibitionism, and crossing the line with paedo-erotic acts of the late chairman, P. Ludger St√ºper, S.J. who apparently approved of photographing child nudity, even when they were uncomfortable with it. A 2011 report concludes that \\"only in one case can a co-operation of religious, provincial, and school leaders be recognized to cover up sexual abuse... at the beginning of the sixties.\\"  Co-education  In the 1980s, the Aloisiuskolleg along with nearby Clara Fey High School became co-educational in the upper classes: all students had their choice of either school. After 2002 the Aloisiuskolleg accepted girls in the lower classes, then in 2005 a separate boarding facility was built for girls. Facilities, buildings, and plant=School right The school is a U-shaped, three-storey building from the 1920s. In addition to classrooms it houses two rooms each for chemistry, physics, computers, and music along with a language laboratory and a library. Workmen's equipment is located under the gyms and includes welding devices, a joinery, and printing presses. Between the school building and the newer boarding houses is the \\"Fathers Tower\\", a five-storey square tower in which the fathers lived since improvements in the 1970s. Prior to this, boarding schools with the youngest pupils were accommodated on the two upper floors, which gave the building the nickname \\"boys silo\\". Sports facilities The sports facilities include two gymnasiums next to the school building. In front of the gyms is a basketball court. The school yard also contains a basketball and handball court. Beyond the school yard on the way to Stella there is a football field, a tartan track, five tennis courts, and a half-court (wall-court). Stella Rheni right In 1891-1893 the Elberfeld banker Baron Karl von der Heydt commissioned the \\"Castle on the Juniper\\" by the architect Heinrich PlangeHeinrich Plange: e.g., p. 458. Accessed 21 November 2016. in neoclassical architecture and gave it the name \\"Stella Rheni\\" (Latin for \\"Star of the Rhine\\"). From this strictly geometrical building in yellow sandstone, you can enjoy a view over the Rhine valley and Siebengebirge. Walter von Engelhardt who also landscaped Charlottenburg laid out the extensive park. Since 1927, the Jesuit Villa has been used as a boarding school for young and middle-class boys. J√§gerhaus 180px The \\"J√§gerhaus\\", formerly belonging to the Heydts, is a highly romantic miniature version of a hunting castle and lies about 200 meters below the Stella. Here the primary students used to live on their own, without supervision. New The new building was built together with the school building in the 1960s and was connected to the Fathers' Tower. It was L-shaped and was renovated in 2006. In the renovation a part of it was demolished and replaced by a newly built rotunda: the classic L-shape was not retained. From the new building there is direct access to the rotunda. Girls' house The girls' house was finished in September 2005 after a year of construction on the former fruit orchards opposite the school, by the office of architects Pilhatsch & Partner. The girls' house opened in the summer of 2006, since in the transitional period the building was used for the boys who were boarding, who had to leave the old \\"new building\\" temporarily because of renovation work. Church right An octagonal church was built in the early 1980s, on the site of a dilapidated church from the 1960s. The showpiece of the church is a bronze sculpture of an angel by Ewald Matar√©.  Alumni  Former pupils of the school can remain connected through the alumni network.

Early life Carr was educated at Dulwich CollegeDulwich College website and then at Jesus College, Oxford. After theological studies at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, he was ordained a deacon in 1967 and a priest in 1968. Ministry Carr's first appointment was as a curate at St Mary's Church, Luton (Diocese of St Albans) from 1967 to 1971. He was then a tutor (1970‚Äì1971) and a chaplain (1971‚Äì1972) at Ridley Hall, Cambridge. While at the University of Sheffield he was an honorary curate at Ranmoor (Diocese of Sheffield) from 1972 to 1974. From 1974 to 1978, Carr was the chaplain of Chelmsford Cathedral (Diocese of Chelmsford). Until 1982 he was also deputy director of the Cathedral Centre for Research and Training. From 1978 to 1987 he was a canon residentiary of the cathedral. From 1976 to 1984 he was also Diocesan Director of Training. In 1987 Carr left Chelmsford to become Dean of Bristol. In 1997 he moved to Westminster Abbey, where later that year he officiated at the funeral service of Diana, Princess of Wales. In 2002 he also officiated at the funeral of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother. In 1998 he was at the centre of a controversy over his abrupt dismissal of the abbey's Director of Music, Martin Neary, over accounting practices for professional concerts and recordings occurring outside the abbey. The matter was contested and referred to Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle for determination at the behest of Queen Elizabeth II. While Lord Jauncey's report upheld Neary's dismissal in finding him to be partially at fault, he was careful to note Neary's years of exceptional service and that his actions were not legally wrongful and did not amount to meaningful harm. The finding further criticised the dean and chapter for the manner in which Neary was dismissed, stating that the abbey, \\"must score gamma minus on the scale of natural justice\\" and concluding with the observation that, \\"had the parties been prepared to discuss openly and frankly the Abbey's concerns, to acknowledge that serious mistakes had been made and to consider the reasons therefor, it might perhaps have been possible to avoid the present unhappy situation with all its attendant publicity and to have reached a rather less dramatic resolution of their differences.\\"http://justus.anglican.org/resources/misc/jauncey98.html Carr was made an honorary DLitt of the University of the West of England in Bristol in 1997. On his retirement as Dean of Westminster in 2006 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) on 17 February. As a priest he has the same precedence as a knight of the relevant order. Carr is the author of a number of books about aspects of the Christian faith.

In a wider sense, it may include any kind of woody plant vegetation growing in and around human settlements. As opposed to a forest park, whose ecosystems are also inherited from wilderness leftovers, urban forests often lack amenities like public bathrooms, paved paths, or sometimes clear borders which are distinct features of parks. Care and management of urban forests is called urban forestry. Urban forests can be privately and publicly owned. Some municipal forests may be located outside of the town or city to which they belong. Urban forests play an important role in ecology of human habitats in many ways. Aside from the beautification of the urban environment, they offer many benefits like impacting climate and the economy while providing shelter to wildlife and recreational area for city dwellers.  Urban forests around the world  Tijuca Forest in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil In many countries there is a growing understanding of the importance of the natural ecology in urban forests. There are numerous projects underway aimed at restoration and preservation of ecosystems, ranging from simple elimination of leaf-raking and elimination of invasive plants to full-blown reintroduction of original species and riparian ecosystems. Some sources claim that the largest man-made urban forest in the world is located in Johannesburg in South Africa. Others have disputed this claim due to satellite pictures revealing how developed the city is with roads and buildings. Johannesburg, however, is still a very densely wooded city with reportedly 6.0 million trees planted throughout streets and private lots.Cherry Blossoms lining the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C.Tijuca Forest, in Rio de Janeiro, has also been considered to be the largest urban forest. It began as a restoration policy in 1844 to conserve the natural remnants of forest and replant in areas previously cleared for sugar and coffee. The larger metropolitan area encircle the forest which moderates the humid climate and provides sources of recreation for urban dwellers. Nebraska National Forest is the largest man-made forest in the United States located in the state of Nebraska. It lies in several counties within the state and is a popular destination for campers year-round. Several cities within the United States have also taken initiative investing in their urban forests to improve the well-being and economies of their communities. Some notable cities among them are Austin, New York, Seattle, and Washington, D.C. New York, for example, has taken initiative to combat climate change by planting millions of trees around the city. In Austin, private companies are funding tree-planting campaigns for environmental and energy-saving purposes.  Environmental impact  Urban forests play an important role in benefitting the environmental conditions of their respective cities. They moderate local climate, slowing wind and stormwater, and filter air and sunlight. They are critical in cooling the urban heat island effect, thus potentially reducing the number of unhealthful ozone days that plague major cities in peak summer months. Air pollution reduction As cities struggle to comply with air quality standards, trees can help to clean the air. The most serious pollutants in the urban atmosphere are ozone, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfuric oxides (SOx) and particulate pollution. Ground-level ozone, or smog, is created by chemical reactions between NOx and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight. High temperatures increase the rate of this reaction. Vehicle emissions (especially diesel), and emissions from industrial facilities are the major sources of NOx. Vehicle emissions, industrial emissions, gasoline vapors, chemical solvents, trees and other plants are the major sources of VOCs. Particulate pollution, or particulate matter (PM10 and PM25), is made up of microscopic solids or liquid droplets that can be inhaled and retained in lung tissue causing serious health problems. Most particulate pollution begins as smoke or diesel soot and can cause serious health risk to people with heart and lung diseases and irritation to healthy citizens. Trees are an important, cost-effective solution to reducing pollution and improving air quality. ;Trees reduce temperatures and smog With an extensive and healthy urban forest air quality can be drastically improved. Trees help to lower air temperatures and the urban heat island effect in urban areas. This reduction of temperature not only lowers energy use, it also improves air quality, as the formation of ozone is dependent on temperature. Trees reduce temperature not only by directly shading: when there is a large number of trees it create a difference in temperatures between the area when they are located and the neighbor area. This creates a difference in atmospheric pressure between the two areas, which creates wind. This phenomenon is called urban breeze cycle if the forest is near the city and park breeze cycle if the forest is in the city. That wind helps to lower temperature in the city. *As temperatures climb, the formation of ozone increases. *Healthy urban forests decrease temperatures, and reduce the formation of ozone. *Large shade trees can reduce local ambient temperatures by 3 to 5 ¬∞C *Maximum mid-day temperature reductions due to trees range from 0.04 ¬∞C to 0.2 ¬∞C per 1% canopy cover increase. *In Sacramento County, California, it was estimated that doubling the canopy cover to five million trees would reduce summer temperatures by 3 degrees. This reduction in temperature would reduce peak ozone levels by as much as 7% and smoggy days by 50%. ;Lower temperatures reduce emissions in parking lotsKlaus I. Scott, James R. Simpson, and E. Gregory McPherson. \\"Effects of Tree Cover on Parking Lot Microclimate and Vehicle Emissions\\" USDA Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station Western Center for Urban Forest Research and Education Temperature reduction from shade trees in parking lots lowers the amount of evaporative emissions from parked cars. Unshaded parking lots can be viewed as miniature heat islands, where temperatures can be even higher than surrounding areas. Tree canopies will reduce air temperatures significantly. Although the bulk of hydrocarbon emissions come from tailpipe exhaust, 16% of hydrocarbon emissions are from evaporative emissions that occur when the fuel delivery systems of parked vehicles are heated. These evaporative emissions and the exhaust emissions of the first few minutes of engine operation are sensitive to local microclimate. If cars are shaded in parking lots, evaporative emissions from fuel and volatilized plastics will be greatly reduced. *Cars parked in parking lots with 50% canopy cover emit 8% less through evaporative emissions than cars parked in parking lots with only 8% canopy cover. *Due to the positive effects trees have on reducing temperatures and evaporative emissions in parking lots, cities like Davis, California, have established parking lot ordinances that mandate 50% canopy cover over paved areas. *\\"Cold Start\\" emissions The volatile components of asphalt pavement evaporate more slowly in shaded parking lots and streets. The shade not only reduces emissions, but reduces shrinking and cracking so that maintenance intervals can be lengthened. Less maintenance means less hot asphalt (fumes) and less heavy equipment (exhaust). The same principle applies to asphalt-based roofing. ;Active pollutant removal Trees also reduce pollution by actively removing it from the atmosphere. Leaf stomata, the pores on the leaf surface, take in polluting gases which are then absorbed by water inside the leaf. Some species of trees are more susceptible to the uptake of pollution, which can negatively affect plant growth. Ideally, trees should be selected that take in higher quantities of polluting gases and are resistant to the negative effects they can cause. A study across the Chicago region determined that trees removed approximately 17 tonnes of carbon monoxide (CO), 93 tonnes of sulfur dioxide (SO2), 98 tonnes of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and 210 tonnes of ozone (O3) in 1991. ;Carbon sequestration Urban forest managers are sometimes interested in the amount of carbon removed from the air and stored in their forest as wood in relation to the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere while running tree maintenance equipment powered by fossil fuels. ;Interception of particulate matter In addition to the uptake of harmful gases, trees act as filters intercepting airborne particles and reducing the amount of harmful particulate matter. The particles are captured by the surface area of the tree and its foliage. These particles temporarily rest on the surface of the tree, as they can be washed off by rainwater, blown off by high winds, or fall to the ground with a dropped leaf. Although trees are only a temporary host to particulate matter, if they did not exist, the temporarily housed particulate matter would remain airborne and harmful to humans. Increased tree cover will increase the amount of particulate matter intercepted from the air. * Large evergreen trees with dense foliage collect the most particulate matter. * The Chicago study determined that trees removed approximately 234 tonnes of particulate matter less than 10 micrometres (PM10) in 1991. * Large healthy trees greater than 75 cm in trunk diameter remove approximately 70 times more air pollution annually (1.4 kg/yr) than small healthy trees less than 10 cm in diameter (0.02 kg/yr).  Rainwater runoff reduction  Virginia opossum being sheltered by an old tree Urban forests and trees help purify water sources by slowing down rain as it falls to the earth and help it soak into the soil, thereby naturally filtering out pollutants that can potentially enter water supply sources. They reduce storm water runoff and mitigate flood damage, protecting the surrounding rivers and lakes. Since water is an irreplaceable resource, planting trees, hence enhancing urban forestry, can help protect and clean a city's water supply.  Urban wildlife  Trees in urban forests provide food and shelter for wildlife in cities. Birds and small mammals use trees as nesting sites, and reptiles use the shade they provide to keep cool in the hot summer months. Furthermore, trees provide shade necessary for shrubbery. Not only do urban forests protect land animals and plants, they also sustain fish and water animals that need shade and lower temperatures to survive. Economic impacts  The economic benefits of trees and various other plants have been understood for a long time. Recently, more of these benefits are becoming quantified. Quantification of the economic benefits of trees helps justify public and private expenditures to maintain them. One of the most obvious examples of economic utility is the example of the deciduous tree planted on the south and west of a building (in the Northern Hemisphere), or north and east (in the Southern Hemisphere). The shade shelters and cools the building during the summer, but allows the sun to warm it in the winter after the leaves fall.The physical effects of trees‚Äîthe shade (solar regulation), humidity control, wind control, erosion control, evaporative cooling, sound and visual screening, traffic control, pollution absorption and precipitation‚Äîall have economic benefits.  Energy and CO2 consumption  Urban forests contribute to the reduction of energy usage and CO2 emissions primarily through the indirect effects of an efficient forestry implementation . The shade provided by trees reduces the need for heating and cooling throughout the year. As a result, energy conservation is achieved which leads to a reduction of CO2 emissions by power plants. Computer models indicate that annual energy consumption can be reduced by 30 billion kWh using 100 million trees in U.S. urban areas. This energy consumption decrease equates to monetary savings of $2 billion. Additionally, the reduction of energy demand would reduce power plant CO2 emissions by 9 million tons per year.  Water filtration  The stormwater retention provided by urban forests can provide monetary savings even in arid regions where water is expensive or watering conservation is enforced. One example of this can be seen in a study carried out over 40 years in Tucson, AZ, which analyzed the savings of stormwater management costs. Over this period, it was calculated that $600,000 in stormwater treatment costs were saved. It was also observed that the net water consumption was reduced when comparing the water required for irrigation against power plant water consumption due to the effects of urban forests on energy usage. In another instance, New York City leaders in the late 1990s chose to pursue a natural landscape management instead of an expensive water treatment system to clean the Catskill/Delaware watershed. New Yorkers today enjoy some of the healthiest drinking water in the world.  Tourism and local business expansion  The USDA Guide notes on page 17 that \\"Businesses flourish, people linger and shop longer, apartments and office space rent quicker, tenants stay longer, property values increase, new business and industry is attracted\\" by trees.  Increases in property values  Urban forests have been linked to an increase in property value surrounding residents. An empirical study from Finland showed a 4.9% increase in property valuation when located just one kilometer closer to a forest. Another source claims this increase can range as high as 20%. The reduction of air, light, and noise pollution provided by forests is cause for the notable pricing differentials.  Sociological impacts  The Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, California  Community health impact  Urban forests offer many benefits to their surrounding communities. Removing pollutants and greenhouse gases from the air is one key reason why cities are adopting the practice. Removing pollutants from the air, urban forests can lower risks of asthma and lung cancer. Communities that rely on well-water may also see a positive change in water purity due to filtration. The amenities provided by the city of each urban forest varies. Some amenities include trails and pathways for walking or running, picnic tables, and bathrooms. These healthy spaces provide for the community a place to gather and live a more active lifestyle.  Mental health impact  Living near urban forests have shown positive impacts on mental health. As an experimental mental health intervention in the city of Philadelphia, trash was removed from vacant lots, some of them being selectively \\"greened\\" by plantings trees, grass, and installing small fences. Residents near the \\"greened\\" lots who had incomes below the poverty line reported a 68% decrease in feelings of depression, while residents with incomes above the poverty line reported a decrease of 41%. The Biophilia hypothesis argues that people are instinctively drawn to nature, while Attention Restoration Theory goes on to demonstrate tangible improvements in medical, academic and other outcomes, from access to nature. Proper planning and community involvement are important for the positive results to be realized.

This would have been before this had become an established tradition; at this time the police were still hassling naked cyclists in the parade. Fremont Solstice Parade, 2005 (2005) (2007) Inline skaters often join the cyclists. (2007) Art bikes, as seen here (2005) and below (2007), are becoming increasingly popular. right The Solstice Cyclists (also known as The Painted [Naked] Cyclists of the Solstice Parade, or The Painted Cyclists) is an artistic, non-political, clothing-optional bike ride celebrating the Summer Solstice. It is the unofficial start of the Summer Solstice Parade & Pageant, an event produced by the Fremont Arts Council in the Fremont district of Seattle. The event was started by streakers who crashed the parade. The first people to do so were a small group of friends and roommates from the adjacent (Wallingford) neighborhood, several of whom were bicycle couriers by trade. Participants now emphasize bodypainting and other artistry. The group is the largest and fastest growing ensemble associated with the parade. The parade, put on by Fremont Arts Council, is held on a Saturday close to the actual solstice. Art bikes are common and cycles include BMX bikes, cycle rickshaws, unicycles, clown bicycles, tall bikes, lowrider bicycles, tandem bicycles and tricycles. People come from all over the country to ride. Full and partial (especially topfree) nudity is popular, but not mandatory. While cyclists open the parade, they are not in the parade line-up (except in 2003 when they had a float). Parade rules say \\"any printed communications, written words, recognizable logos, signage, leaf-letting, or advertising in any form are prohibited on the parade route.\\" Recent events include a pre-ride bodypainting party, a party ride through the city, and the parade itself at noon. Controversy 2001 and subsequent years were controversial for the naked cyclists, including references to them as \\"parade crashers\\". In 2001, police and organizers posted laws against indecent exposure to warn of possible prosecution. Organizers claimed cyclists were getting in the way of the event's artistic freedom.\\"If you fret, stay clear of Fremont\\" by Nicole Brodeur, The Seattle Times, May 17, 2001 An editorial that day (May 17, 2001) in The Seattle Times said: \\"They have stolen the spotlight on a parade that is supposed to be about art, not about being unclothed.

Twenty-odd friends gathered to get painted and ride together to the parade, including a woman who wore a 3-buttcheek bodysuit costume rather than paint. Members of the Fremont Arts Council launched a spoof of the naked bicyclists as well. Wearing flesh-colored bodysuits with exaggerated body parts sewn on, they cycled down the parade route while two bicyclists pretending to be police officers gave chase. When the truly naked cyclists showed up, they blended right in with their Fremont Arts Council bodysuit imposters. \\"And, of course, there were the infamous and crowd-pleasing nude bikers, a regular attraction eagerly awaited by the parade watchers. ...

The pose itself could have either shown the apprehension or the cop gleefully stopping for a picture next to the bicyclist. The panel was put on a small platform on wheels and parade goers were invited to have their pictures taken with their heads poking out of the holes of the naked bicyclists and the officer. In 2001, the city threatened to withdraw the event permit for the Fremont Arts Council because of the nudity. Signs were actually made warning naked cyclists that they may be subject to arrest. The city ended up backing off before the event day. Fremont Arts Council parade organizers urged riders to participate within the artistic spirit of the event. Many locals were very upset that the city would threaten to arrest one of the parade's most popular and creative ensembles. The blowback effect, as predicted by Seattle City Council Chair Nick Licata, ended up being more publicity and popularity for the cyclists which, in turn, led to more cyclists wanting to join the ensemble. In efforts to combat this effect, the Seattle City Council was invited by the Fremont Arts Council to participate in the parade. Nick Licata was the only one who agreed and ended up cycling through as the \\"un-naked cyclist\\". After jeers of \\"Take your clothes off\\" he was met by a parade monitor who told him to get off the parade route, stating \\"Yeh? We still don't have bike riding in the parade. If one person rides then others will and then the whole parade will have bikes riding all over the place.\\"\\"Council Member Nick Licata As Himself, Or, How I Was Busted For Riding A Bike, With Clothes On\\" by Nick Licata, June 17, 2001 Licata later lamented in a Seattle Times article, \\"I was waving to the photographer - smack in the middle of a pack of painted, naked bicyclists.\\"\\"Uneasy rider in Fremont\\" by Jean Godden, The Seattle Times, June 20, 2001 \\"There was no better illustration of the fair's quirkiness than in its parade - with its wild costumes, floats and giant puppets - and nude bicyclists, which led to a flap over the permit for this year's parade. ... Before the city issued this year's parade permit, police said they have gotten numerous complaints about the nude cyclists every year. They asked the Fremont Arts Council to post signs along the parade route warning cyclists, who are not a sanctioned part of the parade, about laws against indecent exposure. The council said no, even though members discouraged the nudity. ... In 1998, two bikers in the buff were arrested. None were arrested this year.\\"\\"Fremont shows its sunny side\\" by Reid Forgrave, The Seattle Times, June 17, 2001 2002 \\"What solstice is complete without nude cyclists?

Last year there were 50 ‚Äî most in body paint.\\" 2003 2003 marked the twelfth year of naked cyclists taking part in the Solstice Parade. The parade took place on June 21, 2003. Numbers quadrupled from previous years to between 75 and 80 riders. An internet discussion forum was established for the first time. The bodypainting party took place at the host's house in the Ravenna neighborhood, with a photo shoot at Cowen Park. The procession then began south through the University District on Roosevelt and then on 45th through Wallingford to Phinney Ridge. This is also the first year that the cyclists were officially part of the parade with their Helios-themed float, which several cyclists (partially dressed) climbed aboard after they cycled through the parade. The float featured wispy clouds and gold-painted \\"chariot\\" exercise bikes to evoke a sense of pulling the sun through the summer. Ironically, toward the end of the parade, and despite all the \\"Happy Solstice\\" chants, the sky clouded over and it began to rain. Two digital video films were produced from footage of this year's event. One is called Naked & Painted: The Fremont Solstice Riders 2003 and is sold to friends and future potential riders with proceeds going to a local charity. The other video was called Solstice: A Celebration of the Art of Bodypainting produced by James W. Taylor/Circle Rock Productions and premiered at Naked Freedom Film Festival , held at the Seattle Art Museum on May 15, 2004. Unusually cool weather this year resulting in a number of weather-themed paint jobs. Also in 2003, much publicity was focused on David Zaitzeff's determination to walk naked through the Solstice Parade. Zaitzeff sued Seattle police Chief Gil Kerlikowske in a federal lawsuit because he \\"desires to go nude at the Fremont Solstice Parade without fear of unjust arrest\\". U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik said that because Zaitzeff had not been arrested for indecent exposure, the court couldn't make a prospective ruling on the matter.\\"Puget Sound-Off: Public nudity in Fremont parade\\", Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 2, 2003 Much later in the year there was a suggestion to have the group become part of a larger international naked bike ride, later known as the World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR). The idea was unpopular because the Solstice Parade, unlike WNBR, is a non-political arts event. Secondary reasons for not liking the idea included that WNBR would not be as spontaneous of an event and some may not be as inclined to participate in an artistic way. 2004 The parade took place on June 19, 2004. About 116 cyclists participated, setting a new record. The main group started to ride from the pre-parade bodypainting party at the old Segway building in Ballard. (The building was later demolished to make way for Ballard Civic Center Park.) The ride proceeded down NW Market Street to Leary Way to the parade. The cyclists did not have a float in the parade in 2004, but there were more elaborate art installations on bikes. 2004 also marked the beginning of the Synchronised Cycling Drill Team within the group. The year's theme was Noah's Ark animals. One of the cyclists provided rides to children along the parade route in her cycle rickshaw. A week prior to the event, on June 12, was the first annual World Naked Bike Ride Seattle event and was the first time a major naked cycling event has crossed the channel into downtown Seattle. This ride featured a pre-ride bodypainting party at Gas Works Park, where the end of the painted cyclists ride traditionally took place. 2005 The Synchronised Cycling Drill Team shown performing. right right The parade took place on June 18, 2005. Approximately 138 cyclists leave bodypainting party on the south side of the Lake Washington Ship Canal, and once joined by those waiting at the parade, the numbers probably grew to around 160 cyclists. Part of the ride included going down the Ballard Bridge on 15th Avenue and turning again on NW Market Street. About five cyclists broke off from the group after the end of the parade ride and rode around Green Lake and came back to Fremont. One of the big controversies in 2005 was the Fremont Arts Council excluding People Undergoing Real Experiences (PURE) (now known as Pure cirkus) from dressing \\"up as pirates with two people suspended on a pirate ship float from hooks in their skin\\" as they go through the parade. Much of the media noted that while the naked cyclists are tolerated and widely popular, this has become the new controversial area for the council.\\"Fremont lowering the bar on tolerance\\" by Robert L.

Jamieson Jr., Seattle Post- Intelligencer, June 14, 2005 A week later, a third painted ride, called the Body Pride Ride, was started by one of the painted cyclists, and took place for the first time in the Seattle Gay Pride Parade on Capitol Hill. A WNBR mini-ride in September marked 2005 as a record-setting year not only for the number of painted cyclists participating, but also for doubling the number of painted naked rides in Seattle to a total of four. \\"If bike riders rode nude in a Los Angeles summer solstice celebration, the LAPD would shoot them dead, after a 'slow speed' chase televised on all 28 local channels.\\"\\"Letters to the editor: Strictly Seattle: Nothing to see here\\", The Seattle Times, June 21, 2005 \\"Really, that's just the crazy naked bicyclists who precede the parade every year.

With one exhibitional blow, months of hard work by solstice parade artists is knocked from our collective conscious.\\"\\"People power: Chaos, creativity fuel Fremont parade\\" by L.J. McAllister, The Seattle Sun & Star, June 2005 2006 The 18th Annual Summer Solstice Parade & Pageant, on June 17, 2006, marked the 15th year that naked cyclists have participated in the parade. On March 27, 2006, the Painted Cyclists went public with a public portal website: The Painted Cyclists. KUOW-FM in Seattle did an interview for their program called Weekday with the cyclists at the Ballard neighborhood where the bodypainting party was taking place, taking up at least three residential lots. The interview was reportedly about cycling safety in Seattle. This is confirmed by several cyclists and pictures taken at the bodypainting party. The segment aired on June 22, 2006. 2007 The 19th Annual Solstice Parade took place on June 16, 2007, marking the sixteenth consecutive year the painted cyclists have ridden in the parade. 267 cyclists took to the streets at 11:45 a.m. with little or no confrontation, legal or otherwise. The annual painting party took place at a nearby residence on NW 48th Street in Ballard. For the first time, a video presented by a painted inline skater was shot at the painting party and posted to the website of The Stranger newspaper. 2008 The 20th Annual Solstice Parade took place on June 21, 2008, marking the 17th consecutive year that the painted cyclists have accompanied. Slightly fewer cyclists than in previous years rode, and tension between both the Seattle police and the Fremont Arts Council was minimal. The painting party took place this time in Belltown, meaning the cyclists had to ride a full three miles through the Seattle neighborhood of Queen Anne to get to Fremont. Painting parties were also going on independently of the main party downtown, so riders had to coordinate meeting up at a common location before entering the parade. After making a surprise entrance by entering through the crowd at the middle of the parade route, on Fremont Avenue (which had never been done before), riders were initially rerouted because of the timing of the permits. They later reentered the parade route closer to the traditional starting point and proceeded through the parade, ending the ride at Gas Works Park. 2009 The 21st Annual Solstice Parade took place on June 20, 2009, marking the 18th consecutive year of the painted cyclists. The painting party took place at Hale's Ales in Ballard, and attracted an estimated 430\\"Getting happy with the naked cyclists\\" by Monica Guzman, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 20, 2009 cyclists, plus painters. After riding through Ballard and watching their numbers swell as riders from independent paint parties joined the group, the riders traversed the parade route in Fremont, ending once again at Gas Works Park. Media coverage included an article and video by the Seattle P-I. Ensembles included the \\"Stimulus Package\\" group, appropriate for a year of controversial economic bailouts. This year was also the first year of the Gardens Everywhere Bike Parade. 2010 The 22nd Annual Solstice Parade took place on Saturday, June 19, 2010, marking the nineteenth consecutive year of the painted (and some not-so- painted) solstice cyclists. The painting party again took place at Hale's Ales in Ballard, and attracted hundreds\\"Naked cyclists paint up, warm up via Ballard\\" by Geeky Swedes, Fremont Universe, June 19, 2010 of cyclists, plus painters. Then they jumped on their bikes and headed to Ballard for a warm-up ride in the relatively chilly mid-50s air, surprising unsuspecting drivers and whooping it up down Market Street before returning for the noon start of the parade, where the riders completed the parade route in Fremont. An optional repeat loop-back plan through part of the route was added in 2010, designed to extend the experience for both the riders who opted for it as well as the crowd lining the streets, with a side benefit of minimizing any time gap between the end of the cyclists and the start of the parade proper. That plan met with some confusion due to communication issues with parade officials, and therefore mixed results, but riders vowed to remedy that in 2011. The cyclists ended at the now-traditional clothing-optional \\"victory celebration\\" at and around Kite Hill in Gas Works Park. 2011 The parade took place on June 18, the day before Fathers Day. The skies were overcast and the temperature was in the mid-50s with intermittent misty light rain‚Äîfor the second year in a row, the third Saturday in June was unseasonably cool. But that did not deter the 600+ riders nor curb their enthusiasm. For many, the day started at the old Ballard Library building, which had been rented as the central location for body painting. Earlier in the week, plastic had been laid on the floor and taped into one big surface, then tables set out to delineate separate painting areas. Aisles were painted on the floor in orange with \\"Keep Clear\\" to keep the fire marshal happy and facilitate movement around the area; bumping into someone covered in paint leaves a mark. In the northwest corner was the film crew for Beyond Naked, a documentary about four first time riders. The parade riders gathered in the parking lot next to the library awaiting the go-ahead for the trip through Ballard. Most participants shivered in the cold while logistics were confirmed. Then, off through Ballard, to the amazement of unsuspecting pedestrians, many whooping and hollering encouragement. From there the parade snaked through Fremont in a circuitous route, getting longer at each pass, until it finally ended at Gas Works Park. 2012 The solstice cyclists rode for the 21st consecutive year, starting out by hosting their painting party at the Old Ballard Library, on NW 57th St. and 24th Avenue (the same place as the previous year). The weather was overcast with temperatures in the 60's. 2013 After a morning paint party at a marine hangar in Seattle's Shilshole neighborhood, hundreds of cyclists and skaters rode through Ballard, pausing for a group photo at Ross Park, before entering the parade course in Fremont at 2:45 pm. For the first time in several years the weather was hot and sunny, and as a result the crowd watching the parade was especially dense, and the number of participants was much larger than in previous years, with estimates ranging from several hundred to 1000. 2015 A small group of longtime organizers once again hosted a mass paint party in the Silshole neighborhood. The organizers took a video of the painted cyclists heading out through the gate and counted well over 945 cyclists just at this paint party. En route to the parade starting point they were joined by hundreds of other painted cyclists who swelled the ranks at each passing intersection . The artistry displayed on naked riders' bodies has become more and more intricate each year with some riders bringing their own personal painters to the party. Donations were collected at the entrance and after all expenses were paid the paint party volunteers donated $4,500 to the Fremont Art Council in order to help pay the parade expenses.volunteer/organizer 2016 In the weeks prior to the parade this year there was some friction between the Fremont Arts Council, the official parade organizers, and the cyclist organizers, a non-hierarchical consensus group that comes together once a year and has no formal organization. The FAC wanted the cyclists to become official members of the parade and under their control. The cyclist group are basically anarchists in the way they operate and refused. They agreed to disagree and things went on as usual with close cooperation between the two groups. The numbers dwindled this year as the day dawned cold and damp. A seasoned group of 10 volunteers once again opened the gates to the large, group paint party at a private marina in the 4100 block of Shilshole Ave. N.W. At an entry portal donations were taken and only people who were cyclists to be painted or their painters were allowed to enter. Over several hours 600 clothed cyclists entered and at noon 600 cold (but exuberant) painted naked cyclists exited. The group rode through the Ballard neighborhood and then on to the Fremont Solstice Parade route where they were joined by approximately 100 more painted cyclists from private paint parties. After subtracting expenses, the organized paint party group was able to donate $2,000 to the Fremont Arts Council to help defray the parade costs the following spring. 2018 The warm and sunny weather brought over 700 people to the main cyclist paint party this year. As in past years, the painted, naked (mostly) cyclists filed out of the boat marina in the Ballard neighborhood and did a ride through the streets of the Ballard neighborhood. As the riders entered the parade route, prior to the start of the actual parade, they were not allowed to circulate on the street as had been arranged beforehand with the official Fremont Solstice Parade organizers. Instead they were forced to ride straight through the route with no slow looping back as had become the custom and agreed upon pattern for many years. This left the artists who had spent hours painting, and those who had come to view the parade and the cyclists with a less than satisfactory experience. The alliance between the free-spirited biking artists and the Fremont Arts Council who holds the permit for the actual parade is rapidly fraying at the edges and the outcome remains to be seen. The cyclist paint party group donated $3,170 to the Fremont Arts Council to help toward the cost of the parade.

In the earlier decades of the space industry, the OBDH function was usually considered a part of the TT&C;, particularly before computers became common on board. In recent years, the OBDH function has expanded, so much that it is generally considered a separate subsystem to the TT&C;, which is these days concerned solely with the RF link between the ground and the spacecraft. Functions commonly performed by the OBDH are: * Reception, error correction and decoding of telecommands (TCs) from the TT&C; * Forwarding of telecommands for execution by the target Avionics * Storage of telecommands until a defined time ('time tagged' TCs) * Storage of telecommands until a defined position ('position tagged' TCs) * Measurement of discrete values such as voltages, temperatures, binary statuses etc. * Collection of measurements made by other units and subsystems via one or more data busses, such as MIL-STD-1553. * Real-time buffering of the measurements in a data pool * Provision of a processing capability to achieve the aims of the mission, often using the data collected. * Collation and encoding of pre-defined telemetry frames * Storage of telemetry frames in a mass memory * Downlinking of telemetry to the ground, via the TT&C.; * Management and distribution of time signals Telecommand reception The OBDH receives the TCs as a synchronous PCM data stream from the TT&C; Telecommand execution The desired effect of the telecommand may be just to change a value in the on-board software, or to open/close a latching relay to reconfigure or power a unit, or maybe to fire a thruster or main engine. Whichever effect is desired, the OBDH subsystem will facilitate this either by sending an electric pulse from the OBC, or by passing the command through a data bus to the unit which will eventually execute the TC. Some TCs are part of a large block of commands, used to upload updated software or data tables to fine tune the operation of the spacecraft, or to deal with anomalies. Time-tagged telecommands It is often required to delay a command's execution until a certain time. This is often because the spacecraft is not in view of the ground station, but may also be for reasons of precision. The OBC will store the TC until the required time in a queue, and then execute it. Position-tagged telecommands Similar to time-tagged commands are commands that are stored for execution until the spacecraft is at a specified position. These are most useful for earth observation satellites, which need to start an observation over a specified point of the Earth's surface. The spacecraft, often in sun-synchronous orbits, take a precisely repeating track over the earth. Observations which are taken from the same position may be compared using interferometry, if they are in close enough register. The precise position required is sensed using GPS. Once a position tagged command has been executed, it may be flagged for deletion or left to execute again when the spacecraft is once again over the same point. Processing function The modern OBDH always uses an on-board computer (OBC) that is reliable, usually with redundant processors. The processing power is made available to other applications which support the spacecraft bus, such as attitude control algorithms, thermal control, failure detection isolation and recovery. If the mission itself requires only a small amount of computing power (such as a small scientific satellite) then the payload may also be controlled by the software running on the OBC, to save launch mass and the considerable expense of a dedicated payload computer.

It serves a thousand students of Harford County. History With increasing population growth in this area of once-rural Harford County during the 1970s, the Board of Education determined the need for a secondary school to serve the youth of Fallston. Fallston High School was designed by architect Richard Ayres and built by Cam Construction Company at a cost of $10 million. The ground on which the school is built was formerly a dairy farm. The land was acquired from local Real Estate developer Mr. Joseph Deigert, with an adjacent four acres set aside as a new home for the Fallston Volunteer Fire Company. Fallston High School opened in November 1977 with a staff of 73 and a student population of 1400 in grades 6 through 10, with grades 11 and 12 added in subsequent years. The majority of the original Fallston students transferred from Bel Air schools. Initially the school was a combined Middle/High School but was converted solely to a High School (9-12) with the opening of Fallston Middle School (6th-8th grades) on an adjacent piece of property in 1993. Fallston High School was visited by President Reagan during his time as president on December 4, 1985. The school has a conference room named the Reagan Room to commemorate his visit. Extracurricular activities There are many after school programs available to students, including competitive and non-competitive activities. To keep students' focus on academic achievement, the school has an Eligibility Committee to review student academic progress. If a student enrolled in an extracurricular activity is failing in one or more subject, he or she will be declared ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities.

He played 10 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) ‚Äì mainly as a member of the Atlanta Hawks ‚Äì from 1977 to 1987. He was a two-time NBA-All-Star with the Hawks in 1980 and 1981, and earned two nominations to the NBA All-Defensive Second Team in 1979 and 1980. He was known for his great speed and slashing ability, with a capable outside shot. Johnson's career was cut short when he received a lifetime suspension by the NBA due to a cocaine addiction in 1987. His life after basketball delved further into criminal activities and culminated in Johnson being sentenced to life in prison for sex crimes on a minor in 2008. Early life and college career Johnson was raised in Weirsdale, Florida, as the oldest of five children. His father worked as a laborer. Johnson played basketball with a homemade goal outside his family's house. He was one of the first black students to attend a previously all-white grade school in Weirsdale. He attended Lake Weir High School and started all four years he played. Johnson graduated from Lake Weir as one of the top students in his class. Johnson played college basketball for the Auburn Tigers from 1973 to 1977. He led the Southeastern Conference (SEC) in scoring as a freshman with 21.8 points per game. Johnson led the Tigers in scoring and assists for his first three seasons, and was nominated to the All-SEC Coaches' first-team from 1974 to 1976. Professional career Johnson was selected by the Atlanta Hawks as the 49th overall pick of the 1977 NBA draft. Johnson spent his first season sharing time in the backcourt with 5-foot-8 Charlie Criss. Averaging 10.5 points, the rookie helped the Hawks return to the playoffs after a four- year absence, a feat repeated in six of Johnson's eight full years with the club. With Criss injured the following year, Johnson became a starter in 1978‚Äì79. During that season, Johnson advanced as far as he ever would in pursuit of an NBA championship, losing in the conference semifinals to the Washington Bullets. He was a starter four consecutive seasons, averaging at least 16 points each season. In only his third year in the league, fans voted Johnson into a starting spot in the NBA All-Star Game. He scored 22 points on 11-of-16 shooting in the 1980 midseason classic and 16 points on 7-of-12 shooting as a starter one year later. During that latter regular season, Johnson ranked second on the Hawks in scoring, with a career-high 19.1 points per game. Injuries and drug problems had begun to slow Johnson by 1982; he played in no more than 73 games per year from that point on. Still, he managed to score 16 or more points per game in two of his final three seasons playing with the Hawks. With Johnson, Glenn \\"Doc\\" Rivers, Johnny Davis, Rory Sparrow and Anthony \\"Spud\\" Webb, Atlanta boasted arguably some of the best backcourt talent in the league. Although one of the more popular Hawks during his tenure, Johnson was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers midway through the 1985‚Äì86 season. He would finish his career with the Seattle SuperSonics a year later. Johnson battled a cocaine addiction for many years. After several suspensions, he finally checked himself into rehab in 1986. After he failed to follow through on mandatory counseling, the NBA banned him for life in 1987. In 675 NBA games, Johnson scored 10,163 points, with a career average of 15.1 points per game, reaching double figures in scoring in 9 of his 10 years in the NBA. Personal life Johnson's younger brother, Frank, is a former player and coach in the NBA. He is a distant cousin of fellow basketball player Tree Rollins, who was his teammate on the Hawks. Johnson has three children. Off-court issues and imprisonment Johnson first began using cocaine as a college student. He passed out during a celebratory function at Auburn in 1979 in what was the first public indication of his drug habits. Johnson denied that his drug habits led to his personal issues and stated: \\"The whole idea of me abusing drugs is outlandish.\\" During the 1980 NBA off- season, Johnson escaped unharmed after he jumped off a second-story apartment balcony and fled across a parking lot while two men fired gunshots at him in what police believed was part of a drug dispute. Three weeks later, he was arrested for possession of cocaine while driving a rental car in Atlanta but the charges were dropped because the police's search of the car was deemed illegal. Johnson was taken to a private psychiatric facility in Cobb County, Georgia, and underwent therapy for almost a week. The day after Johnson checked himself out of the facility, he was arrested for stealing a car from a car dealer but the charges were again dropped. Johnson was diagnosed with manic depression by psychiatrists in the Cobb County facility. He was prescribed with lithium tablets that he stopped taking during the 1980‚Äì81 NBA season without the knowledge of the Hawks team. Johnson believed that he no longer needed the medication and it attributed to his tiredness during games. The Hawks became aware of the resumption of Johnson's erratic behavior in July 1981 and persuaded him to submit to a local hospital. Johnson showed up at the Hawks' training camp in October directly from the hospital and became increasingly disruptive as he rebuked teammates, left the floor to play with a child in the stands, and jumped rope on the sidelines while oblivious to his surroundings during practice sessions. After being so alarmed by his actions, Atlanta Hawks President Michael Gearon and General Manager Stan Kasten contacted Johnson's psychiatrist, who signed a commitment order to have Johnson placed in Grady Memorial Hospital. Johnson was picked up by police before a planned practice session and taken to Grady. Johnson was taken off the Hawks' suspended list on November 21, 1981. Johnson's life continued to spiral out of control following his banishment from the NBA. He was arrested and convicted for a litany of crimes over the years, including burglary, robbery, assault on a police officer, and shoplifting. He admitted that he had frequent drug problems which had initially cost him his career. Johnson's rap sheet numbered about 100 arrests and five stints in and out of the Florida prison system when in 2006, he was arrested for burglary and sexual battery and molestation of an 8-year-old girl, while awaiting trial on charges of raping another woman. The arrest created additional controversy when multiple publications used the picture of another NBA player named Eddie Johnson, who believed his reputation had been damaged due to the incident. On October 30, 2008, Johnson was convicted of sexual battery of a minor under 12, lewd and lascivious molestation of a child under 12, and trespassing for the sexual assault of an 8-year-old girl in her home at Parkside Garden Apartments in Ocala, Florida. Johnson denied doing anything inappropriate. The sex crimes carried a mandatory life sentence without parole. Johnson is currently incarcerated at Santa Rosa Correctional Institution.

The Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov rearrangement The Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov ring expansion, Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov rearrangement, or TDR, provides an easy way to increase amino-substituted cycloalkanes and cycloalkanols in size by one carbon. Ring sizes from cyclopropane through cyclooctane are able to undergo Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov ring expansion with some degree of success. Yields decrease as initial ring size increases, and the ideal use of TDR is for synthesis of five, six, and seven membered rings. A principal synthetic application of Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov ring expansion is to bicyclic or polycyclic systems. Several reviews on this reaction have been published.Smith, P. A. S.; Baer, D. R. Org. React 1960, 11, 157‚Äì188. (Review)Coveney, D. J. Compr. Org. Synth. 1991, 3, 781‚Äì782. (Review)Fattori, D. et al. Tetrahedron 1993, 49, 1649. (Review) Discovery The reaction now known as the Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov rearrangement (TDR) was discovered in two steps. The first step of occurred in 1901 when Russian chemist Nikolai Demyanov discovered that aminomethylcycloalkanes produce novel products upon treatment with nitrous acid. When this product was identified as the expanded alcohol in 1903, the Demjanov rearrangement was coined. The Demjanov rearrangement itself has since been successfully used in industry and synthetical organic chemistry. However, its scope is limited. The Demjanov rearrangement is only best suited for expanding four, five, and six member aminomethylcycloalkanes. Moreover, alkenes and un-expanded cycloalcohols form as by-products. Yields diminish as the starting cycloalkane becomes larger. A discovery by French scientists a few years before World War II would result in the modern TDR reaction. In 1937, Tiffeneau, Weill, and Tchoubar published in Comptes Rendus their finding that 1-aminomethylcycloahexanol converts readily to cycloheptanone upon treatment with nitrous acid. Perhaps due to such a large ring being expanded, the authors did not immediately relate it to the Demjanov rearrangement. Instead, they envisioned that their reaction was similar to one discovered by Wallack in 1906. Upon oxidation with permanganate, cycloglycols will dehydrate to yield an aldehyde via an epoxide intermediate . The authors postulated that deamination resulted in a similar epoxide intermediate that subsequently formed a ring enlarge cycloketone. However, in the time that followed, scientists began to realize that these reactions were related. By the early 1940s, TDR was in organic vernacular. Tiffeneau's discovery enlarged the synthetic scope of the Demjanov rearrangement as now seven and eight carbon rings could be enlarged. Since the resulting cycloketone could be easily converted to a cycloaminoalcohol again, this new method quickly became popular among organic chemists. Basic mechanism The basic reaction mechanism is a diazotation of the amino group by nitrous acid followed by expulsion of nitrogen and formation of a primary carbocation. A rearrangement reaction with ring expansion forms a more stable oxonium ion which is deprotonated. :700px Early development of mechanism Although chemists at the time knew very well what the product of a symmetrical 1-aminomethylcycloalcohol would be when exposed to nitrous acid, there was significant debate on the reaction's mechanism that lasted up until the 1980s. Scientists were puzzled over the array of products they would obtain when the reaction was performed on an unsymmetrical 1-aminomethylcycloalcohols and bridged cyclo-systems. Even today, experiments continue that are designed to shed light into the more subtle mechanistic features of this reaction and increase yields of desired expanded products. In 1960, Peter A.S. Smith and Donald R. Baer, both of the University of Michigan, published a treatise on the TDR. Their proposed mechanism contained within provides an excellent perspective of scientist's understanding of the TDR at that time. The mechanism proposed by Baer and Smith was the summation of several sources of information. Since the early 1950s, it had been postulated by many that the TDR mechanism involved a carbonium ion . However, a major breakthrough in the development of the TDR mechanism came with the improved understanding of the phenomenon behind amine groups reacting with nitrous acid. Meticulous kinetic studies throughout the late 1950s led scientists to believe that nitrous acid reacts with an amine by first producing a nitrous acid derivative, potentially N2O3. While this derivative would prove incorrect as it relates to TDR, scientists of the time still correctly came to the conclusion that the derivative would react with the amine to produce the diazonium ion. The inferred instability of this diazonium ion gave solid evidence for the existence of a carbocation in the TDR mechanism. Another piece of information that had implications in the mechanism of the TDR was the simple fact that the reaction proceeds more easily with the conditions discovered by Tiffeneau. By placing an alcohol on the carbon on the reagent, reaction rates and yields are much improved to those of the simple Demjanov rearrangement. Moreover, few unwanted by products are formed, such as olefins. These aforementioned observations were the center around which Smith and Baer's mechanism was constructed. It is easy to see that hydrogen's presence would mean that hydride shifts would occur in competition with carbon shifts during the course of the reaction. Moreover, this shift is likely as it would move place positive charge from a 1¬∞ carbon to a 3¬∞ carbon. In a mildly basic solvent such as water, this new intermediate could easily produce an olefin via an E1-like reaction. Such olefins are typically seen in simple Demjanov rearrangements but are not seen in the TDR. The alcohol's presence explains how this E1 reaction does not occur. Moreover, having an alcohol present puts the developing positive charge of the ring enlarged intermediate next to an oxygen. This would be more favorable than hydrogen as oxygen can lend electron density to the carbonium ion via resonance. This again favors ring expansion and is another caveat that shows how it incorporates higher yields of the TDR over the Demjanov rearrangement. Smith and Baer' mechanism was also able to account for other observations of the time. Tiffeneau‚ÄìDemjanov rearrangements of1-aminomethylcycloalkanols with alkyl substitutions on the side aminomethyl chain had been accomplished by many scientists before 1960. Smith and Baer investigated how such substitution affects the TDR by synthesizing various 1-hydroxycyclohexylbenzyl-amines and exposing them to TDR conditions . Seeing as six member rings are routinely enlarged by the TDR, one might expect the reaction to occur. However instead of the anticipated ring enlargements, only diols are seen as products. Five member analogues to the above substituted reagents enlarge under TDR conditions. Alkyl substitutions as opposed to aryl substitutions result in diminished TDRs. Smith and Baer assert that these observations support their mechanism. Since substitution stabilizes the carbonium ion after damnification, the resulting carbonium ion is more likely to react with a nucleophile present (water in this case) and not undergo rearrangement. Five member rings rearrange due to the ring strain encouraging the maneuver. This strain makes the carbocation unstable enough to cause a carbon to shift. Problems with the early mechanism As definitive as Smith and Baer's early mechanism seems, there are several phenomena that it did not account for. The problem with their mechanism mainly focused around TDR precursors that have alkyl substituents on the ring. When said substituent is placed on the ring as to make the molecule still symmetric, one product is formed upon exposure to TDR conditions. However, if the alkyl is placed on the ring as to make the molecule unsymmetric, several products could form. The principal method for synthesizing the starting amino alcohols is through the addition of cyanide anion to a cyclic ketone. The resulting hydroxynitrile is then reduced, forming the desired amino alcohol. This method forms diastereomers, possibly affecting the regioselectivity of the reaction. For nearly all asymmetric precursors, one product isomer is formed preferentially to another. As TDR was routinely being used to synthesize various steroids and bicyclic compounds, their precursors were rarely symmetric. As a result, a lot of time was spent identifying and separating products. At the time, this phenomenon baffled chemists. Due to spectroscopic and separation limitations, it was very difficult for scientists to probe this caveat of the TDR in a sophisticated way. However, most believed that what was governing preferential product formation involved the migratory aptitudes of competing carbons and/or steric control. Migratory aptitude made reference to the possibility that the preferred product of the reaction was the result of an initial stability of one carbon migrating in preference to another. This possibility was more the belief and subject of research of earlier scientists, including Marc Tiffeneau himself. However, in the early 1960s, more and more scientists were starting to think that steric factors were the driving force behind the selectivity for this reaction. Sterics and Stereochemistry in the mechanism As chemists continued to probe this reaction with more and more advanced technology and methods, other factors began to be tabled as possibilities for what was controlling product formation of unsymmetrical amino alcohols. In 1963, Jones and Price of the University of Toronto demonstrated how remote substituents in steroids play a role in product distribution . In 1968, Carlson and Behn of the University of Kansas discovered that experimental conditions also play a role. These latter scientists established that in ring extension via the TDR, initial temperature and concentration of reagents all played a role in eventual product distribution . Indeed, other avenues of the TDR were being explored and charted. However, Carlson and Behn did manage to report a significant breakthrough in the realm of sterics and migratory aptitudes as they relate to the TDR. As it might be expected based on electronic reasoning, the more highly substituted carbon should migrate preferentially to a less substituted carbon. However, this is not always seen and often accounts of migratory aptitudes show fickle preferences. Thus, the authors assert that such aptitudes are of little importance. Stericlly, thanks chiefly to improved spectroscopic methods, they were able to confirm that having the amine group equatorial to the alkane ring corresponded to drastically different product yields. According to the authors, the preferential formation of D from A does not reflect a preferred conformation of A. Their modeling indicates that both A and B are initially just as likely to become C. He concludes that there must be a steric interaction to develop in the transition state during migration that makes A preferentially form D when exposed to the TDR conditions. The idea that sterics played a factor during migration and was not a factor just at the beginning to the reaction, was new. Carlson and Behn speculate that the factor might lay in transannular hydrogen interactions along the path of migration. Their modeling suggested that this interaction may be more severe for A forming C. However, they are not certain enough to offer this as a definitive explanation as they concede that more subtle conformational and/or electronic effects could be at work as well. At this point, the mechanism proposed by Smith and Baer seemed to be on its way out. If steric interactions relating to carbon migration during the reaction's transition state were important, this did not support the carbocation envisioned by Smith and Baer. Research around bi-cyclics during the 1970s would shed even more light into the TDR mechanism. In 1973, McKinney and Patel of Marquette University published an article in which they used the TDR for expanding norcamphor and dehydronorcamphor. Two of their observations are important. One centers on the expansion of exo and endo-2-norbornylcarbinyl systems. One might expect in (I) that A would migrate in preference to B seeing as such a migration would place the developing charge on a 2¬∞ carbon and pass the specie through a more favorable chair-like intermediate. This is not seen. Only 38% of the product exhibits A migration. To account for why A migration is not dominant in the expansion of I, the authors assert a least movement argument . Simply put, the migration of the non-bridgehead carbon provides for the least amount of total atom movement, something that plays into the energetics of the reaction. This least movement consideration would prove important in the TDR mechanism as it accounts for products with intermediates passing through unfavorable conformations. However, McKinney and Patel also confirm that traditional factors such as developing positive charge stability still play a crucial role in the direction of expansion. They accomplish this by expanding 2-norbornenyl carbinyl systems. By adding a simple double bond to these systems, the authors see a significant increase in the migration of the bridgehead carbon A (50% in this case.) The authors attribute this jump in migration to the fact that this bride carbon migrating allows the developing positive charge to be stabilizing by resonance contributed by the double bond .Therefore, carbocation/ positive charge effects can not be ignored in the discussion of the factors influencing product distribution. Later mechanistic studies As evidence continued to mount during the years after Smith and Baer's publication in 1960, it was obvious that the TDR mechanism would need revisiting. This new mechanism would have to de-stress the carbocation as there are other factors that influence ring expansion. Orientation of the developing diazonium ion, the possibility of steric interactions during the reaction, and atomic movement would all have to be included. In 1982, Cooper and Jenner published such a mechanism . Their mechanism has stood to this day as the current understanding of the TDR . The most obvious departure from Smith and Baer's mechanism is that Cooper and Jenner represent the diazonium departure and subsequent alkyl shift as a concerted step. Such a feature allows for sterics, orientations, and atomic movement to be factors. However, distribution of positive charge is still important in this mechanism as it does explain much of the observed behavior of the TDR. Another observation that should be made is that there is no preference given to these aforementioned factors in the mechanism. That is to say, even today it is very difficult to predict which carbon will migrate preferentially. Indeed, the TDR has become more useful as spectroscopic and separation techniques have advanced. Such advancements allows for the quick identification and isolation of desired products. Since the mid-1980s, most organic chemists have resigned themselves to accepting the fact that the TDR is governed by several factors that often seem fickle in importance. As a result, much research is now being directed towards the development of techniques to increase migration of a specific carbon. One example of such an effort has recently come out of the University of Melbourne. Noting that group 4 metal substituents can stabilize positive charge that is Œ≤ to them, Chow, McClure, and White attempted to use this to direct TDRs in 2004.{157 L. Chow, M. McClure, J. M. White, Silicon and Tin-Directed Tiffeneau Demjanov Reaction, Organic and Biomolec. Chem., 2004, 648‚Äì651} They hypothesized that placing a silicon trimethyl group Œ≤ to a carbon that can migrate would increase such migration . Their results show that this does occur to a small extent. The authors believe that the reason why the carbon migration increases only slightly is that positive charge is not a large factor in displacing the diazonium ion. Since this ion is such a good leaving group, it requires very little 'push' from the developing carbon-carbon bond. Their results again highlight the fact that multiple factors determine the direction of carbon migration.

It was invented during the Ming dynasty. It consists of a bowl, a lid, and a saucer. History Prior to the Ming dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), tea was normally consumed from the vessel in which it was prepared. As described by the tea master Lu Yu, this special bowl had to be large enough to accommodate the implements and actions of tea brewing, though compact enough to be held comfortably in the hands for consumption. The term for this versatile piece of equipment was chawan (Ëå∂Á¢ó; lit. \\"tea bowl\\"). It was during the Ming dynasty that the innovations in both tea ritual and tea preparation gave rise to the gaiwan. Design Gaiwans are made up of three parts: a saucer, a bowl, and a lid. They can be made from a variety of materials, including porcelain and glass. Gaiwans made from Yixing clay or jade are particularly prized by collectors of tea paraphernalia. They are typically small, with a volume of around 100-150 ml. A recently excavated Ming princely burial has yielded the first example to survive until modern times of a type of gaiwan set known from 15th-century paintings. There is a blue and white Jingdezhen porcelain stem cup, that has a silver stand and a gold cover (this dated 1437), all decorated with dragons. Presumably many such sets existed, but recycling the precious metal elements was too tempting at some point, leaving only the porcelain cups.Clunas, Craig and Harrison-Hall, Jessica, Ming: 50 years that changed China, p. 87, 2014, British Museum Press, Function The gaiwan is considered to be particularly good for brewing teas with delicate flavors and aromas, such as green tea and white tea. The versatility of the gaiwan is also noted in the preparation of oolong infusions because of this particular tea's ability to be infused multiple times, but the gaiwan is suitable for any type of tea. The gaiwan is important in tea tasting due to its open and glazed surfaces: the former allows the tea to be viewed while brewing, and the latter prevents altering of the flavour and aroma of the tea during brewing. The lid of the gaiwan allows the tea to be infused right in the bowl and either be drunk right from the bowl (traditionally using the lid to block the leaves for ease of consumption), or decanted into another container. Gaiwan is the preferred method for brewing green and white teas as the gaiwan's porcelain absorbs the heat and does not damage the tea. Gaiwans are less suitable for black teas as the large lid allows heat to escape too quickly during the steeping process. They are especially common in the north of China for enjoying scented teas like jasmine tea. File:YellowGaiwan.jpgA porcelain gaiwan File:YellowGaiwanLidOff.jpgA porcelain gaiwan, lid removed Use Usually all three parts are held at once with both hands. The saucer is held with the fingers of the right hand while the thumb rests on the edge of the bowl. The left hand then holds the lid, which is used to brush away the tea leaves before drinking. It can take some practice to do this, as the liquid is hot.

The population was 119,506 (estimation 2018) in a total area of 5,813.637 km2. Formosa is known for its waterfalls and natural environment. It is a large producer of cattle and grains and is one of the fastest growing cities in the state. A bucolic street scene in Formosa.  History  Arraial dos Couros was the first name of Formosa, which was founded in the second half of the eighteenth century on an uncertain date. For lack of documentation the early history is fragmented and historians can only speculate about the real facts. What is known is that problems connected to the area of health were the motive for the transfer of the old settlement which was founded and built by black slaves, located on the banks of the Itiquira River and the Paran√£ in the tropical Paran√£ valley. At the time a devastating fever swept the place, probably caused by the unhealthy climate of the river location, and the population was afflicted by a degenerative malaria. For fear of getting the disease the move was made very quickly. Even today it is not known who was responsible for the move or the date in which it occurred. The historians register the existence of a new settlement called Couros. It is believed that the name Arraial dos Couros comes from the improvised houses which were covered with the leather of the loads of the tradesmen. The first huts were set up in the old Street of the Crioulos which has been transformed into the present-day Alves de Castro Street. Another theory is that the name could have come from the existence in the site of an artisan who made saddlebags and rawhides for transporting small loads such as hard molasses, salt, rice and other food items. On 1 August 1843 the settlement was elevated to the category of Vila (town), and received the name of Vila Formosa da Imperatriz, chosen for the beauty of the area and to pay homage to the Empress Teresa Cristina. The municipality of Formosa was only created on 22 February 1844. Other important dates are: *1910 - founding of Col√©gio S√£o Jos√©, the Catholic school *1913 - the weather station was established *1920 - arrival of the first automobile in Formosa *1926 - arrival of the first airplane *1928 - inauguration of the telegraph *1932 - the first electric light *1943 - the first Agro-Pecu√°ria (Agro-Cattle) Fair *1960 - the first public telephoneFormosa history  Geography  Formosa belongs to the micro-region called Entorno do Distrito Federal, which is composed of 20 municipalities with 960,000 inhabitants in a total area of 38,212.00 km¬≤. It has municipal boundaries with: *North: S√£o Jo√£o d'Alian√ßa *South: Cabeceira Grande, Minas Gerais *East: Buritis, Minas Gerais *West: Federal DistrictCitybrazil The average elevation of this large area is around 1000 meters, about the same as Bras√≠lia, eighty kilometers away. The terrain is for the most part characterized by gently undulating flat plateau lands, especially to the north and south. There is a deep valley formed by the Paran√£ river which begins just on the northeastern limits of the urban area. This valley has a more tropical vegetation and once had dense forests, now cleared for the most part for cattle raising. The flatlands surrounding Formosa are characterized by cerrado vegetation, consisting of grasslands, interspersed by low, thorn-covered trees, many of which are protected against the annual fires by thick bark.  The Land  Formosa is located in the second largest of Brazil's eco-regions, the Cerrado. The term \\"Cerrado\\" means \\"dense\\" or \\"closed\\" in both Portuguese and Spanish, an unusual term for a region that consists mainly of tree and scrub savannah. Local diversity in parts of the Cerrado is quite impressive. Just within the limits of Bras√≠lia, the 37-year- old capital of Brazil located at the heart of the Cerrado, there are some 81 mammals, 429 birds, 40 snakes and lizards, 11 amphibians, 1,000 butterflies, and 550 bees and wasps recorded to date.Cerrados - the Brazilian savannas Where rivers cut the flatlands there are still areas of dense vegetation, which once had stands of hard tropical wood such as aroeira, angico, peroba, jacaranda, jatob√° and pau ferro. One of the most notable trees is the ip√™ roxo (tabebuia), or purple ip√™. Most of this vegetation has been eliminated by the need to find hard woods for fenceposts and other uses. Even the typical cerrado vegetation has gradually disappeared and been replaced by expanses of soybeans or cattle pasture. See List of plants of cerrado vegetation. The fauna has trickled to traces of what it once was, especially in those areas suitable for mechanized agriculture. Only in the Paran√£ valley, a land of few people and cattle ranches that have caused less damage than soy beans has there been some preservation of wildlife. Birds abound, with parakeets, araras, caracara hawks, wild doves, and toucans a not uncommon sight. The urubu (black vulture), nature's dustman, is ubiquitous. Mammals consist of the guar√° wolf, the armadillo, the ema (a small rhea), deer, two species of monkey: the prego (nail) monkey and the guariba or howler monkey, and the occasional on√ßa pintada or jaguar. In addition, the Cerrado harbors 80 species of bats, which roughly correspond to 60% of the 138 Brazilian bat species, and more than 40% of the total South American bat fauna. Considering only the Cerrado, which has 109 species of non-flying mammals, bats represent 42% of the total mammalian fauna, being, by far, the richest group, followed by rodents (46 sp), carnivores (21) and marsupials (18).CerradoAspectos bioma The most common insect is probably the leaf cutting ant, but common sights are the termites with their innumerable termite hills covering the landscape, several species of spiders, wild bees, dung beetles, especially around the cattle ranches, enormous night moths, and the fireflies with their eerie nocturnal lights. One species of black spider lives in a compact group like a large ball during the daylight hours, their thick as fish line web stretching between large trees. At dusk the spiders scurry out from their cluster to take up positions on the long web and catch the nocturnal insects as they fly blindly to their fate. One insect which is harmful to man is the barbeiro or barber bug (a species of assassin bug)Time Magazine which lives in the walls of poor, country hovels and feeds on the inhabitants at night. It is responsible for the Chagas Disease, which has no cure and is usually fatal. New cases are rare because of a national campaign of elimination of the insect host. Ticks are abundant, especially in high grass, as are screwworm flies (called berne in Portuguese) which cause havoc in cattle herds and can even lay their eggs on humans. The damage to the cow's hide can be disastrous unless controlled. A common parasite on farms is the bicho do pe or foot worm (tunga penetrans), which loves to embed itself between the toes.Ufrgs.br Luckily, at this elevation other tropical illnesses such as malaria and yellow fever are rare. The upper Paran√£ valley though, with its lower elevation and higher temperatures is quite unhealthy and its inhabitants run the risk of a wide gamut of tropical diseases as well as the added attraction of poisonous snake bite. Medical care in this region is non-existent.  Rivers, Lakes and Waterfalls  Lagoa Feia Formosa lies at the source of three Brazilian river basins: the Amazon River represented by the Ribeir√£o Bandeirinha, the R√≠o de la Plata represented by the Ribeir√£o Pipiripau and the S√£o Francisco River represented by the Ribeir√£o Santa Rita, being called by the poet from Goi√°s, Leo Lince ‚Äì ‚ÄúCradle of the Waters of Brazil‚Äù. There are many rivers and waterfalls in the surrounding area. An attractive lake with a rather paradoxical name - Lagoa Feia - is located on the edge of the city. One of Brazil's highest waterfalls - Itiquira Falls is located about 30 km to the north. The main rivers of the Municipality are: *The Paran√£ River ‚Äì is the most important with a length of 500 km. It begins in a series of streams and in the eastern valley of the Serra Geral do Paran√£, 4 km from the city. It flows through the interior of the municipality in a northern direction and receives more than 30 tributaries. It separates the municipalities of Formosa and S√£o Jo√£o d'Alian√ßa. In the extreme north it receives the Paraim on the border with Flores de Goi√°s. *The Preto River ‚Äì it begins in Lagoa Feia, on the border with the Federal District and serves as a boundary between the DF and the state of Goi√°s. It receives several tributaries, the most important being the Ribeir√£o Bezerra. *The Urucuia ‚Äì its source is located to the east, 26 km from Formosa.  Climate  The climate is characterized as tropical altitude. The average temperature is about 25 ¬∞C. Temperatures vary little from month to month with perhaps a slight increase in the rainy season. The south of the municipality is higher and therefore temperatures are lower while the Paran√£ valley has hot and humid weather. What characterizes the climate of Formosa is less temperature than rainfall. The year may be divided into two seasons, the summer or rainy season lasting from October to April and the winter or dry season lasting from May to September.  Economy  Economic activity in Formosa is based primarily on services and agriculture with soybeans, cattle raising, rice, manioc and corn being the main sources of income. The GDP in 2005 was R$428 million, of which 290 million was generated by services. There are several small industries producing furniture and bricks.IBGE  Cattle Raising  Zebu cattle on a farm near Formosa. Extensive cattle raising for meat is still the main economic activity of the municipality. The 2006 census showed that there were 237,000 cows, of which 25,800 were dairy cows.IBGE Most of this cattle is exported, especially to the nearby market of two million people in the Federal District. Sheep raising is an activity - 1,899 - and is mainly done by Gaucho immigrants from Rio Grande do Sul. In recent years more enterprising farmers, especially those who have come from the south - the Gauchos - have utilized soil correction, replacement of traditional grasses by imported, drought resistant varieties (braquiara), and pasture rotation to increase productivity. Other than poor grasses the biggest problem in this area has always been the long period of drought during the winter months of June, July, and August. In some years not one drop of rain falls. Pastures turn brown and reservoirs and streams dry up. Cattle begin to lose weight and mortality increases. Ranches must have a substantial stand of elephant grass and sugar cane to serve as the basis for feed which is supplemented by ground corn (the corn is picked and left to dry in storage) or rice bran (farelo). Many farms produce these crops only for cattle feed purposes. Silage is also becoming popular but traditional ranchers resist any change. Dairy farming is in the incipient stage in Formosa and mechanical milking is still rare. The low price of milk paid to the producers, the high cost of technology, and the lack of trained personnel discourage improvement in this area.  Agriculture  Agriculture is characterized by the moderate production of soybeans and corn. The growing of soybeans was associated not only to modernization but to the obtaining of easy rural credit by producers who came from the south of the country - Rio Grande do Sul and Paran√° - looking for abundant and cheap land. The arrival of these farmers caused a revolution in the development of the municipality. Soybeans, corn, rice, and beans began to be planted with advanced techniques - mechanization, soil correction, chemical fertilizers, and even pivot irrigation. The local economy, which had been based entirely on cattle raising, went through a transformation which created more jobs and service enterprises. Huge grain storage facilities have appeared on the outskirts of town and there are now dozens of shops specializing in supporting the agricultural economy. Other important agricultural products from the region are rice, sugar cane, beans, manioc, tomatoes, and pineapples. Fruit trees are planted in every back yard and on the fazendas, but production is mainly for local consumption. Common fruits are oranges, lemons, tangerines, papaya, mango and passion fruit. Agricultural data (2006) *Farms: 2,501 *Total area: 303,633 *Area in permanent crops: 5,798 *Area in perennial crops: 43,569 hectares *Natural Pasture: 185,318 hectares *Woodland and Forest: 78,638 hectares *Persons connected to agriculture: 6,500 *Cattle herd: 237,000 head *Tractors: 479 *Main crops: soybeans (7,500 hectares), corn (3,500 hectares),beans (1,300 hectares), and rice (800 hectares)  Industry, Commerce, and Services  The economic scene in Formosa is made up of small enterprises including cereal processing, brickworks, lumber mills, furniture factories, and bakeries. Almost all of them are family owned. Out of the 1463 economic entities listed in 2004, 997 had fewer than 4 workers. There were only 9 with more than 50 workers.Seplan Commerce and services are probably the fastest growing segment of the local economy. With a population of 90,000 in the region there is a need for a variety of goods and services. As mentioned above, there are a large number of enterprises selling agricultural products or connected to agriculture such as tractor repair or machine repair shops. Construction materials firms are also important. Health and Education In 2005 there were 37 health establishments. These consisted of 18 public clinics and 15 private clinics. There were 03 private hospitals and 01 public hospital. There were 113 hospital beds available to the public. In the educational sector there were 60 public and 10 private primary schools. There were 12 public and 7 private middle schools. There were 50 pre-schools‚Äî40 public and 10 private. In higher education there were 02 schools, one public and 01 private. Total enrollment in 2005 was 3,300 students. Quality of Life Since housing is cheaper in Formosa than in nearby Bras√≠lia many people live there and commute, usually by bus, to the capital. This influx of new dwellers has caused the population of Formosa to grow rapidly in recent years. This fact, in addition to the lack of public investment, has overburdened services such as health and education. At the time of this writing the city had no sewage system or sewage treatment plant, although extensive construction began in 2005 to remedy this problem. Almost all of the houses use septic tanks, endangering the groundwater which is vital to this region where so many important rivers have their source. Most public schools give poorly taught lessons to students, mainly because the government funds are not enough to assist the education professionals, keep adequate spaces or teaching tools and materials. Private schools provide little better, mainly just paying the yearly fees is enough for the students to receive a high school diploma. Public security is minimal, waiting times for police to arrive when called is up to an hour. When large public shows appear in the outskirts of the city, the infrastructure is quickly overwhelmed and violence soon starts. Lack of oversight of local police also contributes to public safety problems. Human Development Index 2000 *MHDI: 0.750 *State ranking: 75 (out of 242 municipalities) *National ranking: 1,867 (out of 5,507 municipalities).Frigoletto.com.br  Tourist Sites  The most important tourist attraction in Formosa is Itiquira Falls, but the surrounding area is rich in caves, waterfalls, and rushing rivers. In recent times groups of criminals have taken to robbing people walking the pathways to Itiquira and so caution is recommended when visiting this site is small groups. All information about tourist sites is from the Prefeitura de Formosa  Lagoa Feia  Lagoa FeiaLagoa Feia means ugly lake in Portuguese. Located four kilometers from the center of the town, the Preto River, which flows south into the S√£o Francisco, begins here. The south bank is part of an army base which is used for field training.  O Buraco das Araras  This cave, called Hole of the Macaws, is 41 kilometers from Formosa, following BR-20 north as far as the village of Bezerra. The cave is located in the middle of a flat landscape with scarce vegetation. One may see high trees and a river which forms a lake at the entrance of a cavern. This crater is 126 meters deep. The cave itself is one of the largest dolinas (caves formed by the caving in of the ceiling) in the world and was discovered in 1912. Inside the immense hole there are tropical vegetation, ancient trees, volcanic rocks, and several species of animals like monkeys, wild cats and assorted birds. The parrots, who lent their name to the place, no longer live here, mainly due to destruction of the population for the illegal pet trade by local inhabitants . There are no tourist conveniences, and descent into the crater is considered dangerous.  Buraco das Andorinhas  There is another crater called Buraco das Andorinhas (Hole of the Swallows) which is located in the same area. It too has a subterranean lake and was formed by the caving in of the ceiling of a cavern. Access is very difficult and recommended for the young and adventurous. To reach the mouth of the cavern one must use ropes because the wall has no steps, and is covered with loose rock, wet clay, and moss. Once down, one will arrive at the entrance of one of the caverns which is surrounded by ferns. From this point on it is completely dark, so the use of helmets and lights is required.  Lajeado  It is a rock formation that cover over 500 meters of the riverbed which makes its descent forming falls that end in a pool of crystal water, two meters deep. The site has no tourist facilities.  The Upper Itiquira and Indai√°  Located in the micro-basin of the Itiquira River, the Indai√° Falls take their name from the company that bottles mineral water in the site. The walk down to the river and the falls is slightly difficult since it follows a very steep series of steps, which can be treacherous in the rainy season. The landscape has one thousand waterfalls, the smallest having 50 meters height. There are many pools for swimming in the polluted water. The river passes through a canyon and is surrounded by dense vegetation. Another poorly marked path will take the hardy walker to the top of the Itiquira Falls. In the area there is a camping site with adequate bathrooms. Recently it has become an hangout for armed robbers who wait for people either walking to or from the waterfalls and then rob people of all their possessions knowing that there isn't a big chance of the police interfering. No caution is recommended before venturing to the falls in large groups or into areas where there are bunches of people.

In 1995, Ray and Gary go to America to find Elvis memorabilia to sell on the market stall Ray runs in London. A former US Army cameraman, Harvey, sells them a silent black and white film of Elvis performing live, but later returns with an intriguing offer. Harvey takes Ray to Miami, Florida to see a film from 1947 showing the autopsy of an alien supposedly killed in a UFO crash in Roswell, New Mexico. Harvey wants to sell the film for $30,000. Gary and Ray return to England to look for an investor to give them the money. Ray convinces Laszlo Voros, a Hungarian art dealer obsessed with crop circles, to give him the $30,000 and retrieves the film from Harvey. Back in England, the pair discover that the film has degraded from humidity and heat and is now completely unwatchable. In order to avoid serious repercussions from Voros, they decide to make their own recreation of it. They base the content on Ray's memories of the original, and, with the help of some friends, fashion a convincing replica of the dead alien using a mannequin and meat products obtained from a friend's butcher's shop, turn the living room of Gary's sister into a film set, and shoot the film on a Bell and Howell spring-wound camera. Ray gives a copy of the final product to Voros, who believes it to be real. Having convinced Voros, Ray and Gary decide to sell the film to other venues, earning them a large sum of money. However, when Voros hears about its international distribution, he demands 80% of the profits. A potential clash is averted when Voros is killed by a green Land Rover while standing naked in the middle of a crop circle, leading to speculation that he has been killed by a CIA agent. Ray and Gary travel to Argentina to promote the film, followed by reporter Amber Fuentes, who seduces Ray. She eventually tracks down Harvey, who demands from Ray and Gary that they maintain his anonymity. To fulfil this obligation, they produce an interview with a homeless former actor playing Harvey, which convinces Amber. She remains sceptical, however, about the film's authenticity. Ray and Gary are now persuaded that some of the original 1947 footage might actually be recovered by film restoration experts in order to be viewed. However, after viewing the results, the pair bury the film, telling each other that they cannot continue with the endeavour.

He was promoted to be a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1897. Ill health caused his retirement in 1914. He appeared to be a stern judge, who did not suffer fools gladly and often imposed exceptionally severe sentences in criminal cases. Although the story is often thought to be apocryphal, Maurice Healy maintained that Holmes did once sentence a man of great age to 15 years in prison, and when the prisoner pleaded that he could not do 15 years, replied \\"Do as much of it as you can\\".Maurice Healy The Old Munster Circuit Michael Joseph Ltd 1939 His judgments did however display some good humour and humanity, and the sentences he imposed often turned out to be less severe in practice than those he announced in Court.

The debate centers around soteriology, or the study of salvation, and includes disputes about total depravity, predestination, and atonement. While the debate was given its Calvinist‚ÄìArminian form in the 17th century, issues central to the debate have been discussed in Christianity in some form since Augustine of Hippo's disputes with the Pelagians in the 5th century.  Quinquarticular Controversy  The Synod of Dort (1618‚Äì1619) in a 17th-century Dutch engraving The Quinquarticular Controversy is a term used to refer to the purely theological Calvinist‚ÄìArminian clashes of the period 1609 to 1618, a time in which the debate had serious political overtones in the Netherlands. This controversy is the one that was addressed by the Dutch Reformed churches at the Synod of Dort in 1618‚Äì1619, a meeting to which Protestant representatives from Reformed churches in other countries were invited. Quinquarticular (i.e. \\"having to do with five points\\") refers to points of contention raised by the Arminian party in its publication of five articles of Remonstrance in 1610. These were rejected by the Synod in the Canons of Dort, the essence of which is commonly referred to as the Five Points of Calvinism. The Controversy marked the transformation of the Arminian movement into a separate, persecuted church organization in the Netherlands. For Arminians it was the start of full persecution after the imposition of an edict, while for Calvinists it resulted in the settling in clear points of doctrine that were initiated by John Calvin and clarified by Theodore Beza. For Lutherans the controversies saw the ending of any possibility of unification with the Calvinists.  Theological background =Augustine and Pelagius Sixth-century portrait of Augustine of Hippo (354‚Äì430) at the Lateran church Pelagius was a British monk who journeyed to Rome around the year 400 A.D. and was appalled at the lax behavior within churches. To combat this lack of holiness, he preached a Gospel that began with justification through faith alone (it was actually Pelagius, not Luther, who first added the word alone to Paul's phrase) but finished through human effort and morality. He had read Augustine's Confessions and believed it to be a fatalistic and pessimistic view of human nature. Pelagius' followers, including Caelestius, went further than their teacher and removed justification through faith, setting up the morality- and works-based salvation known as Pelagianism. It should be mentioned that the only historical evidence of the teachings of Pelagius or his followers is found through the writings of his two strongest opponents ‚Äî Augustine and Jerome. In response to Pelagius, Augustine adopted a theological system that included not only original sin (which Pelagius denied), but also a form of predestination. Some authors maintain that Augustine taught the doctrines of limited atonement and of irresistible grace, later associated with classic Calvinism; however, others insist that Augustine's writings conflict with these doctrines.For example, in On Catechising the Uninstructed 18(30), he writes, \\"For He ... gave freedom of will to men, in order that they might worship God not of slavish necessity but with ingenuous inclination....\\" Critics maintain that part of Augustine's philosophy might have stemmed from his expertise in Greek philosophy, particularly Platonism and Manichaeism, which maintained a very high view of a man's spirit and very low view of a man's body. Against the Pelagian notion that man can do everything right, he taught that man could do little right. Thus, he reasoned, man cannot even accept the offer of salvation ‚Äî it must be God who chooses for himself individuals to bring to salvation. A group of Italian bishops, led by Julian, defended the Pelagian view against the Augustinian concept of predestination but was rejected by the Council of Ephesus in 431. Later a monastic movement in Southern Gaul (modern-day France) also sought to explain predestination in light of God's foreknowledge, but a flurry of writings from Augustine (Grace and Free Will, Correction and Grace, The Predestination of the Saints and The Gift of Perseverance) helped maintain the papal authority of his doctrines. Semi-Pelagianism and Semi- Augustinianism After the death of Augustine, a more moderate form of Pelagianism persisted, which claimed that man's faith was an act of free will unassisted by previous internal grace. The Second Council of Orange (529)Second Council of Orange text: http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/orange.txt was convened to address whether this moderate form of semi-Pelagianism could be affirmed, or if the doctrines of Augustine were to be affirmed. The determination of the Council could be considered \\"semi-Augustinian\\".\\"The Medieval Experience: Foundations of Western Cultural Singularity\\", By Francis Oakley (University of Toronto Press, 1 January 1988), page 64\\"An Exploration of Christian Theology\\", Don Thorsen (Baker Books, 2007), 20.3.4 It defined that faith, though a free act, resulted even in its beginnings from the grace of God, enlightening the human mind and enabling belief.Cf. Second Council of Orange ch.5-7; H.J. Denzinger Enchiridion Symbolorum et Definitionum, 375-377Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 However, it also denied strict predestination, stating, \\"We not only do not believe that any are foreordained to evil by the power of God, but even state with utter abhorrence that if there are those who want to believe so evil a thing, they are anathema.\\" The document received papal sanction. Calvinist Reformers used the Council's canons to demonstrate that their formulations of original sin and depravity had already been taught much earlier in the church. Arminian theologians also refer to the Council of Orange as a historical document that strongly affirms man's depravity and God's prevenient grace but does not present grace as irresistible or adhere to a strictly Augustinian view of predestination. Middle Ages Thomas Aquinas (1225‚Äì1274) in a portrait, , by Gentile da Fabriano Augustine's teaching on divine grace was considered a touchstone of orthodoxy within the western church throughout the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, within an Augustinian context, theologians continued to debate the precise nature of God and man's participation in salvation, as well as attempting to work out a place for the church's emerging system of sacraments in the overall scheme of salvation. Thomas Aquinas, the most influential Catholic theologian of the Middle Ages, taught that, from man's fallen state, there were three steps to salvation: # Infusion of grace (infusio gratiae)- God infuses grace into the human soul - the Christian now has faith and, with it, the ability to do good - this step is entirely God's work and is not done by man, and once a man has faith, he can never entirely lose it - however, faith alone is not enough for salvation; # Faith formed by charity (fides caritate formata)- with man's free will restored, man must now do his best to do good works in order to have a faith formed by charity; and then # Condign merit (meritum de condigno) - God then judges and awards eternal life on the basis of these good works which Aquinas called man's condign merit. Aquinas believed that by this system, he had reconciled Ephesians 2:8 (\\"By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God\\") and James 2:20 (\\"faith without works is dead\\") and 2:24 (\\"by works a man is justified and not by faith only\\"), and had provided an exposition of the Bible's teaching on salvation compatible with Augustine's teachings. A second stream of medieval thought, commonly referred to as the Ockhamists after William of Ockham and also including Duns Scotus and Gabriel Biel rejected Aquinas‚Äô system as destroying man's free will. The Ockhamists argued that if a man loved God simply because of \\"infused grace\\", then man did not love God freely. They argued that before a man received an infusion of grace, man must do his best in a state of nature (i.e. based on man's reason and inborn moral sense). They argued that just as God awards eternal life on the basis of man's condign merit for doing his best to do good works after receiving faith as a gift from God, so too, the original infusion of grace was given to man on the basis of \\"congruent merit\\", a reward for man's doing his best in a state of nature. (Unlike condign merit, which is fully deserved by man, congruent merit is not fully deserved, and includes a measure of grace on God's part. Congruent merit is therefore also sometimes called \\"semimerit\\". According to the Ockhamists, a gracious God awards an individual with congruent merit when he or she does the best that he or she is able to do.) Aquinas‚Äô followers, commonly referred to as the Thomists, accused the Ockhamists of Pelagianism for basing the infusion of grace on man's works. The Ockhamists defended themselves from charges of Pelagianism by arguing that, in the Ockhamist system, God was not bound to award the infusion of grace on the basis of congruent merit; rather, God's decision to award the infusion of grace on the basis of congruent merit was an entirely gracious act on God's part. Martin Luther's condemnation of \\"justification by works\\" clearly condemned Ockhamism. Some proponents of ecumenism argue that the Thomist view of salvation is not opposed to Luther's view of grace, and, since Ockhamism was rejected as Semipelagian by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent, theology of salvation need not pose a bar to Protestant-Catholic reunion. (The major streams of modern Catholic thought on the theology of salvation are Thomism and Molinism, a theology developed by Jesuit theologian Luis Molina in the 16th century and also held today by some Protestants such as William Lane Craig and Alvin Plantinga.) However, since the Catholic Church's rejection of Jansenism in the bull Unigenitus (1713), it has been clear that Calvinism could not be accommodated within Catholicism. Arminianism, on the other hand, while it might not square entirely with Catholic theologies of salvation, probably could be accommodated within the Catholic Church, a fact which Arminianism's Protestant opponents have often pointed out. (Augustus Toplady, for example, famously claimed that Arminianism was the \\"Road to Rome.\\") Martin Luther and Erasmus of Rotterdam Desiderius Erasmus (1466/69‚Äì1536) in a 1523 portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger Martin Luther was an Augustinian monk in Erfurt. In his Disputation Against Scholastic Theology of 4 September 1517, Luther entered into the medieval debate between the Thomists and the Ockhamists by attacking the Ockhamist position and arguing that man by nature lacks the ability to do good that the Ockhamists asserted he had (and thus denying that man could do anything to deserve congruent merit). Modern scholars disagree about whether Luther in fact intended to criticize all scholastics in this Disputation or if he was concerned only with the Ockhamists. Arguing in favor of a broader interpretation is the fact that Luther went on to criticize the use of Aristotle in theology (Aristotle was the basis of Thomist as well as Ockhamist theology). If this is the case, it is likely that Luther saw Aquinas' fides caritate formata as merely a more cautious form of Pelagianism (or as Semipelagianism). Luther continued to defend these views. In 1520, Pope Leo X issued the papal bull Exsurge Domine, which condemned a position which Luther had maintained at the 1518 Heidelberg Disputation, namely that \\"After the Fall free will is something in name only and when it does what is in it, it sins mortally.\\" Luther subsequently defended the proposition in his Defense and Explanation of All the Articles Unjustly Condemned by the Roman Bull of Leo X (1520), in the process stating that \\"free will is really a fiction...with no reality, because it is in no man's power to plan any evil or good. As the article of Wycliffe, condemned at Constance, correctly teaches: everything takes place by absolute necessity.\\" Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam, though first sympathetic to Luther, reacted negatively to what he saw as Luther's determinism. In his De libero arbitrio diatribe sive collatio (A Disquisition on Freedom of the Will) (1524), Erasmus caricatures the limitations of free will that he saw Luther espousing. Though at times in the Diatribe, Erasmus sounded like an Ockhamist, for the most part he attempted to espouse a middle course between grace and free will, attempting to avoid on the one hand the errors of the Pelagians and the Ockhamists, and on the other hand, the \\"Manichaean\\" error of Luther and other strict Augustinians. Luther responded with his De Servo Arbitrio (On the Bondage of the Will) (1525) in which he attacked Erasmus vehemently and argued that man was not free to do good. Rather, man's fallen nature is in bondage to sin and to Satan and man can only do evil. The only way an individual can be saved is if God freely chooses to give that person the gift of faith. Luther's position in On the Bondage of the Will became the position adopted by the Protestant movement.  Jacobus Arminius and the Synod of Dort  Jacobus Arminius enrolled at Leiden University, and after five years of education traveled in the early 1580s to study in Geneva. Theodore Beza was the chairman of theology at the university there. Beza later defended Arminius by saying \\"let it be known to you that from the time Arminius returned to us from Basel, his life and learning both have so approved themselves to us, that we hope the best of him in every respect‚Ä¶\\" In late 1587, at the age of 28, Arminius returned to Amsterdam to fulfill his desire to be a pastor. Arminius' entry into the predestination debate in Amsterdam was two years after his return, when he was asked by city officials to refute a modified form of Beza's Lapsarianism. According to historic tradition, Arminius' study of the Scriptures led him to the conclusion that the Bible did not support Calvinism. Other scholars believe that Arminius never accepted Beza's views, even while a student at Geneva. Arminius avoided adding to the controversy apart from two incidents regarding sermons on Romans 7 and Romans 9. When Arminius received his doctorate and professorship of theology at Leiden in 1603, the debate over Calvinism came back to life. Conflicts over predestination had appeared early in the Dutch Reformed Church, but \\"these had been of a local nature, occurring between two fellow ministers, for instance, but since the appointment of Jacobus Arminius as a professor at Leyden University (1603) the strife had moved to the place where the education of future ministers took place.\\" Arminius taught that Calvinist predestination and unconditional election made God the author of evil. Instead, Arminius insisted, God's election was an election of believers and therefore was conditioned on faith. Furthermore, Arminius argued, God's exhaustive foreknowledge did not require a doctrine of determinism. Arminius and his followers believed that a national synod should confer, to win tolerance for their views. His opponents in the Dutch Reformed Church maintained the authority of local synods and denied the necessity of a national convention. When the States of Holland called together the parties, Arminius's opponents, led by his colleague Franciscus Gomarus, accused him not only of the teaching of the doctrines characteristic of Arminianism as it would become (see below), but also of errors on the authority of Scripture, the Trinity, original sin, and works salvation. These charges Arminius denied, citing agreement with both Calvin and Scripture. Arminius was acquitted of any doctrinal error. He then accepted an invitation to a \\"friendly conference\\" with Gomarus but his health caused the conference to end prematurely. Two months later, on 19 October 1609, Jacobus Arminius died. The Remonstrants and Calvinist reaction After the death of Arminius, the Hague court chaplain, Johannes Wtenbogaert, one of the professor's followers \\"who dogmatically and theologically was on one line with him, but who in the field of Church politics was a much more radical supporter of state influence championed his cause. This was seen as a betrayal on Gomarus' side, for earlier in his career (as a minister of Utrecht) Wtenbogaert \\"had resisted state influence with all his might\\". Gradually Arminian-minded candidates for ordination into the ministry ran into ever greater difficulties. In their classes examinations, not only was subscription to the Dutch Confession and the Heidelberg Catechism demanded (which most were willing to do), \\"but they were asked questions that were formulated in such a way that ambiguous answers were no longer possible.\\" In reaction to this growing pressure Wtenbogaert drew up a petition to the State General, called a \\"Remonstrance\\" in late 1609, early 1610. The \\"Remonstrants\\" highlighted five aspects of their theology: (1) election was conditional on foreseen faith; (2) Christ's atonement was unlimited in extent; (3) total depravity; (4) prevenient and resistible grace; and (5) necessity of perseverance and the possibility of apostasy. Consistent with the views of the late Arminius, the Remonstrant first expressed an uncertainty about the possibility of apostasy which they removed latter in the document they presented officially at the Synod of Dort, The Opinion of The Remonstrants (1618). Johan van Oldenbarnevelt (1547‚Äì1619), political leader of the Remonstrants Forty-four ministers (mostly from the province of Holland) signed onto the Remonstrance, and on 14 January 1610 it was submitted to the Grand Pensionary, Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. (Due to this document the followers of Arminius became known as Remonstrants.) Oldenbarnevelt held onto the Remonstrance for an unusually long period and it was not until June 1610 that it was submitted in an altered form to the States of Holland. \\"The States sent the five articles to all classes, forbidding them to go 'higher' in their examinations of ordinands than what was expressed in the articles. Needless to say, most classes did not take the slightest notice of this prohibition.\\" In another attempt to avoid a provincial synod, the States held The Hague Conference which lasted from 11 March to 20 May 1611 (with intermissions). It was at this conference that the delegates of Arminius' opponents submitted a response to the Remonstrance, called the Counter-Remonstrance (from which the name Contra- or Counter-Remonstrants was given them). Leading influences among Arminius' followers (now called Remonstrants) were Arminius' close friend and Roman Catholic-turned-Reformed pastor Jan Uytenbogaert, lawyer Hugo Grotius, and a scholar named Simon Episcopius. Due to the Remonstrants‚Äô view of the supremacy of civil authorities over church matters, King James I of England came out in support of the Remonstrance (later he would join with their opponents against Conrad Vorstius). Behind the theological debate lay a political one between Prince Maurice, a strong military leader, and his former mentor Johan van Oldenbarnevelt, Grand Pensionary of Holland and personification of civil power. Maurice, who had Calvinist leanings, desired war with Holland's enemy, Roman Catholic Spain. Oldenbarnevelt, along with Arminius and his followers, desired peace. Numerous historians hold that many of the civic officials that sided with the Remonstrants did so because of their shared position of State supremacy over the Church and not because of other doctrinal ideas, saying \\"the alliance between the regents and the Remonstrants during the years of the Truce is merely a coalition suited to the occasion, not the result of principal agreement...the magistracy of Delft was Counter-Remonstrant-minded, but in the States of Holland the city supported Oldenbarnevelt's policy regarding the convocation of a National Synod [to avoid calling one]. Incidentally, suspectedly Calvinistic opinions went together in Oldenbarnevelt's person. \\" In the years after Arminius' death, Maurice became convinced that Oldenbarnevelt (and by association, Arminians) had strong Catholic sympathies and were working to deliver Holland to Spain. As insurance, Maurice and his militia systematically and forcibly replaced Remonstrant magistrates with Calvinist ones. Thus, when the State General called for a synod in 1618, its outcome was predetermined. Oldenbarnevelt and Grotius were arrested, and the synod, held at Dordrecht (Dort), was convened. This Synod of Dort included Calvinist representatives from Great Britain, Switzerland, Germany, and France, though Arminians were denied acceptance. Three Arminian delegates from Utrecht managed to gain seats, but were soon forcibly ejected and replaced with Calvinist alternates. The Synod was a six versus six style of representation that lasted over six months with 154 meetings. The synod ultimately ruled that Arminius' teachings were heretical, reaffirming the Belgic Confession and Heidelberg Catechism as its orthodox statements of doctrine. One of the results of the synod was the formation of the five points of Calvinism in direct response to the The five articles of the Remonstrants. Robert Picirilli gives this summary of the aftermath of the Synod of Dort: Somewhat later, after Maurice died, the Remonstrants were accorded toleration by the state and granted the freedom to follow their religion in peace, to build churches and schools. The Remonstrant Theological Seminary was instituted in Amsterdam, and Episcopius and Grotius were among its first professors. Today both the seminary and the church have shifted from their founders' theology.  Seventeenth-century English politics  Early Stuart society was religious, and religion at that time was political. King James I managed religious conflicts for most of the 1610s, but most Protestants maintained a fear of Catholicism. Though Arminians were Protestant, they were perceived as being less antagonistic to Catholicism than the Calvinists were. James I initially moved to keep them out of his realm, and supported the official position of the Synod of Dort. In 1618, the Thirty Years' War began. It was a religious war, and many of James's subjects (particularly in Parliament) wanted his kingdom to go to war on the side of the king's son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine. James, however, preferred diplomacy. The loudest of the supporters for war were Puritans, a term presenting difficulties of definition but who doctrinally were in general orthodox Calvinists. Some scholars believe that the Arminians' support for the king's efforts to prevent war led to him promoting a number of them in order to balance out the Puritans. Others argue that these promotions were simply the result of meritocratic considerations: 'James promoted Arminians because they were scholarly, diligent and able men in their diocese.' In 1625, James I died, leaving the throne to his son, Charles I. Charles I supported the Arminians, and continued the trend of promoting them; Charles tended to promote only Arminians. The religious changes which Charles imposed on his subjects, in the form of Laudianism, were identified (rightly or wrongly) with Arminian theology. They brought him into direct conflict with the Scottish Presbyterian Calvinists of the Church of Scotland. The resulting Bishops' Wars were a trigger for the English Civil War, both of them part of the larger Wars of the Three Kingdoms which had complex roots, among which religious beliefs were a major factor.  Four-point Calvinists  Richard Baxter (1615‚Äì1691), father of English Presbyterianism and the most well-known advocate of four- point Calvinism The so-called \\"four-point Calvinists\\" claim that the doctrine of limited atonement is non-scriptural and that it was never endorsed by Calvin or the Synod of Dort. The four-point Calvinists, like five-point Calvinists, accept a distinction initially made by Peter Lombard and subsequently adopted by Thomas Aquinas that the atonement was sufficient for the whole world but efficient only to the elect. Put another way, Christ's death atones for the whole world (it is sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world), but the benefits of Christ's death are applied only to the elect (it is efficient only to atone for the sins of the elect). The four- point Calvinists argue that Calvin adopted this position when he wrote that \\"It is also a fact, without controversy, that Christ came to atone for the sins 'of the whole world.'\\" They also believe that the four-point position was endorsed by the Synod of Dort under Article 3 of the Second Main Point of Doctrine where the synod proclaimed that \\"This death of God's Son is the only and entirely complete sacrifice and satisfaction for sins; it is of infinite value and worth, more than sufficient to atone for the sins of the whole world.\\" This is the position which the leader of the English Presbyterians, Richard Baxter, asserted in his famous controversy with the leader of the English Congregationalists, John Owen.  Early Methodism  George Whitefield (1714‚Äì1770) collaborated with John Wesley in the founding of Methodism, but remained a Calvinist and broke with Wesley when Wesley became an Arminian. These theological issues played a divisive part in the early history of Methodism in the 18th century. Heated discussions on Arminianism took place between Methodist ministers John Wesley and George Whitefield. From 1740 Wesley broke with Calvinism. His position caused initially the rupture with the Welsh Calvinistic Methodists under Howell Harris in 1742‚Äì3; and then the creation of the Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion in 1756, about the same time when Wesley broke with James Hervey. In the 1770s a very sharp debate occurred between Wesley and Augustus Montague Toplady. Wesley was a champion of the teaching of Arminius, defending his soteriology in a periodical entitled The Arminian and writing articles such as Predestination Calmly Considered. He defended Arminius against charges of semi-Pelaganism, holding strongly to beliefs in original sin and total depravity. At the same time, Wesley attacked the determinism that he claimed characterized unconditional election and maintained a belief in the ability to lose salvation. Whitefield debated Wesley on every point (except for their agreement on total depravity) but did not introduce any additional elements into the Calvinists' conclusions set forth at Westminster.  Protestant denominational distinctions  To this day, Methodism and offshoots of the denomination: Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventists and Third Wave, along with General Baptists, usually are the ones to subscribe to Arminianism, while Presbyterians, Reformed Churches, Reformed Baptists, and others subscribe to Calvinism. Largely because of its origins in Germany and Scandinavia rather than the British Isles or Holland, Lutheranism was uninvolved in the dispute, and official Lutheran doctrine does not fully support either group, preferring instead its own doctrinal formulations about the relation of human freedom to divine sovereignty. This is also true of Primitive Baptist belief. Restorationist fellowships are customarily freewill in their soteriology. Within this trend, Churches of Christ are prone to cite Biblical passages in support of the view while often intensely locked in contention with Presbyterians and (usually Calvinistic) Baptists. The doctrinal components, in small towns particularly in the United States, often ally the Churches of Christ with their Methodist neighbors on opposition to \\"once-saved-always-saved\\" doctrine despite the similarity between Churches of Christ and Baptists on immersion.  Roman Catholic views  Post-reformation Roman Catholicism has remained largely outside the debate, although Thomist and Molinist views continue within the church. Augustinian theodicy, including those elements wherein Calvin was influenced by Augustine of Hippo, continues to be the prevalent soteriology in Roman Catholicism. Also, Jansenism has been seen by many as very similar to Calvinist doctrine, and was condemned as such by the Catholic Church in the late 17th century.  Eastern Orthodox views  A Synod of Eastern Orthodox Churches was called in Jerusalem in 1672 to refute attempted encroachments of Protestant Calvinism. The Synod of Jerusalem (1672) also referred to as The Confession of Dositheus in 1672,\\"Creeds of the Churches: A Reader in Christian Doctrine, from the Bible to the Present,\\" John H. Leith (Westminster John Knox Press, 1 January 1982), Page 485 strongly rejected Calvinistic formulations and named them heresy. In part, it stated, In the same document, the synod renounced Calvin by name and pronounced an anathema upon anyone teaching that God predestined anyone to evil or Hell.

Its main branch, opened in 1937 near Carnegie Hall, was located at 854 7th Avenue (between 54th and 55th Streets) in Midtown Manhattan. It closed on December 31, 2016.\\"Iconic Carnegie Deli closes at midnight\\", Eyewitness News, ABC 7 New York, December 30, 2016\\"'It is delicious, we will miss it so much': NYC's legendary Carnegie Deli says goodbye\\", CBS News, December 30, 2016 There is one branch still in operation at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The deli, though having had its main branch closed, still operates a wholesale distribution service. The Parker family's delicatessen was in its third generation of owners. Among the United States' most renowned delis, it was operated by a second-generation owner, Marian Harper Levine. The restaurant offered pastrami, corned beef, and other sandwiches containing at least of meat, as well as traditional Jewish fare such as matzoh ball soup, latkes, chopped chicken livers, and lox. The restaurant also offered other, non-Jewish food such as ham, sausage, and bacon. Available for order were cheesecake portions of over a pound per serving. The restaurant's motto was: \\"If you can finish your meal, we've done something wrong\\". In addition to the large servings, the restaurant was also known for its surly waiters, who allegedly tried to impart some of the stereotypical gruffness of New York to visitors.  History  Inside the Carnegie Deli in 2006 Early history Leo Steiner (c. 1939 ‚Äì December 31, 1987) was a Jewish American restaurateur who was co- owner of the first Carnegie Deli, located at 55th Street and Seventh Avenue in Midtown Manhattan near Carnegie Hall. While his partner, Milton Parker, mostly worked behind the scenes, Steiner worked the crowd with his Jewish humor in the restaurant, which became a destination for both celebrities and tourists in the theater district. Steiner was born in Newark, New Jersey. He worked in his parents' grocery store in nearby Elizabeth, New Jersey, where he grew up. The one-time owner of Pastrami & Things, a delicatessen located at Third Avenue and 23rd Street, he joined Milton Parker and Fred Klein in 1976, purchasing the Carnegie Deli from the trio of Bernie Gross, Max Hudas and Thomas North. Klein, who had not been actively involved in running the business, dropped out shortly thereafter. Under the management of Parker and Steiner, the deli became known nationwide, attracting celebrities such as Woody Allen, Jackie Mason and Henny Youngman, and opened branch locations in Atlantic City, New Jersey; Secaucus, New Jersey; and Tysons Corner, Virginia. Steiner became the public face of Jewish food, appearing in a television commercial for rye bread. He created a 60-pound Statue of Liberty carved from chopped liver, complete with a torch fashioned from a turkey wing, for the United States Bicentennial and was asked to prepare corned beef and pastrami for visiting heads of state attending the G7 economic summit meeting held in 1983 in Williamsburg, Virginia. Portions of Woody Allen's 1984 movie Broadway Danny Rose were filmed in the restaurant. Milton Parker, who died in 2009, had written a book (with Allyn Freeman) called How to Feed Friends and Influence People: The Carnegie Deli, providing the history of the family's ownership. Main branch closures and Pop-up location On April 24, 2015, the main, Midtown Manhattan branch of Carnegie Deli was closed temporarily due to the discovery of an illegal gas line in the restaurant. Con Edison was investigating the restaurant, later fining the eatery $40,050. On July 28, 2015, Carnegie Deli was subsequently closed for upgrades to its energy lines after the discovery of improperly siphoning off natural gas for the previous six years. The deli reopened on February 9, 2016. On September 30, 2016, it was announced that the Midtown Manhattan branch of the deli would close by the end of the year. The owner, Marian Harper Levine, stated that she needed a more permanent break from operating the restaurant, saying, \\"At this stage of my life, the early morning to late night days have taken a toll, along with my sleepless nights and grueling hours that come with operating a restaurant business in Manhattan.\\" Two branches in Las Vegas, Nevada and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania remained open, as well as the wholesale distribution service. At midnight on December 31, 2016, Carnegie Deli on Seventh Avenue closed after almost eighty years of service. Pop-up restaurant on Lafayette Street The Bethlehem location closed at the end of 2017. In December 2018, for one week only, Amazon Prime worked with the owners of the Carnegie Deli to bring the restaurant back to life on Lafayette Street in the Nolita section of Manhattan as a pop-up restaurant in celebration of the second season of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel. There were more than six thousand reservations taken to dine-in with servers in period attire. Food was offered at 1958 prices and all purchases were made as suggested donations to charity. Cuisine and culture The deli's corned beef and pastrami, celebrated by smoked meat connoisseurs nationwide, were cured in the store's cellar using Steiner's own recipe in a two-week-long curing process. The Carnegie Deli used a half-ton of brisket to prepare a week's supply of corned beef by the time of his death. Steiner admitted, \\"You could eat it after seven days, but if you wait until the 13th you're in heaven.\\" The Carnegie Deli was the favorite hangout of comedian Henny Youngman, and Adam Sandler included a reference to the deli in \\"The Chanukah Song\\" in 1996. Steiner was eulogized by comedian Henny Youngman as \\"the deli lama\\". The walls of the deli are nearly completely covered with autographed pictures of celebrities who have eaten there. Menu items have been named after famous patrons, including a corned beef and pastrami sandwich named after Woody Allen after the deli served as a filming location for Broadway Danny Rose. A number of items on the menu feature Broadway themes and Yiddish vocabulary, including dishes like \\"nosh, nosh, Nanette\\" (after the musical, \\"No, No, Nanette\\") and \\"the egg and oy\\" (\\"The Egg and I\\"). There are also some humorous items in the menu, like the famous liver sandwich named \\"50 Ways to Love Your Liver\\" after the Paul Simon song \\"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.\\" It is a place many reporters in the city frequent, including staffers from Black Rock (aka the CBS Building) like Bob Simon. In March 2012, the deli introduced a sandwich dedicated to newly arrived New York Jets quarterback Tim Tebow. The sandwich, named the \\"Jetbow\\", was priced at $22.22, weighs in at 3.5 lbs and consists of corned beef, pastrami, roast beef, American cheese, lettuce and tomato on white bread.  Branch locations  One of the deli's two remaining branch locations, at The Mirage on the Las Vegas Strip The deli opened several branch locations in the 1980s, including two New Jersey branches in Secaucus and Atlantic City and one in the Washington, D.C. suburbs in Tysons Corner.Johnston, David. \\"Washington Talk: Suburbia; Pastrami, With Glitz and Politesse\\", The New York Times, 1987-10-09. Retrieved on 2009-04-20. However, most of these branches have since closed and are no longer in operation. One, in Beverly Hills, California, was financed by oil billionaire Marvin Davis and designed by restaurant designer Pat Kuleto at a cost of $4 million to be the \\"best deli in the world\\", in response to Davis' complaint that the delis in California were not as good as those in New York. The deli operated a second location on the Las Vegas Strip, which opened at The Mirage in 2005. The Las Vegas location closed a few weeks prior to February 9, 2020. A third location opened in 2006 at the Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey and served as the \\"healthy choice\\" restaurant at the park; however, the menu was smaller and only had the restaurant's most popular items. The fifth location was at the Sands Casino Resort in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. It opened on November 22, 2009, and closed at the end of 2017. In addition to the retail operation, the restaurant sells cheesecakes and merchandise such as T-shirts and baseball caps online. Critical reception In 2013, Zagat gave it a food rating of 23, and rated it the 8th-best deli in New York City. USA Today has called the restaurant the \\"most famous\\" deli in the United States.

It is based on television shows such as Robot Wars and Battlebots. There are three games in the series, Robot Arena released in 2001, Robot Arena 2: Design and Destroy released in 2003, and Robot Arena 3 released in 2016. Games=Robot Arena Robot Arena was the first game in the series to be released. The objective was to build a robot using available parts and enter competitions to try and win. The player first chose a chassis, then added batteries, weapons and armour, only being able to choose what they could afford from the amount of money that they had. The game received mostly negative reviews. IGN gave it a 4.3 out of 10 writing \\"While it's prettier than most budget titles, it also suffers from the vacancy that so often comes with nice looking people, dogs, or mechanical monsters. It looks great standing still, but give it a complicated task and it all goes to pieces\\". GameSpot wrote \\"Even at the low retail cost of $19.99, Robot Arena isn't worth it. You'd end up getting more entertainment if you randomly chose two movies at an over-priced movie theater\\". Robot Arena 2: Design and Destroy Robot Arena 2: Design and Destroy (or just Robot Arena 2 or RA2 as most people called it) was released two years after the original. In late 2001, a tech demo was released by Infogrames as a promotional release for the game. It was merely an open sandbox where the player could control three robots. It contained two flippers, a saw blade, some barrels, an oil slick, two open pits, and two platforms that could be driven onto. When the game was released officially, it had fixed many of the previous games issues. The funding system used in order to build a robot was scrapped entirely, as players could now chose any weapons or batteries for free. Chassis available to use were also scrapped in favor of the player now being able to draw their own chassis, also being able to angle sides to make wedges. The robots were now built more realistically and the difficulty on each was now varied instead of all the robots acting the same way as they did in the first game. The game also introduced the Havok physics engine, which meant that robots were now able to leave the ground so flippers and wedges could be used effectively. The game received mostly positive reviews. GameSpy gave it 77 out of 100 writing \\"A pleasant surprise. Whether you're going head-to-head against formidable AI bots or human opponents, it has plenty to offer both newcomers and bot-bashing aficionados alike\\". Robot Arena 3 Robot Arena 3 (stylised as Robot Arena III) was quietly announced in May 2015, using the header: \\"Create. Destruction,\\" replacing the old Robot Arena 2 information on the website. However it wouldn't be until March 2016, when the game was officially announced to the public. Infogrames did not publish this installment as publication was under the new publishing house Octopus Tree, a branch of Encore Publishing Group. Robot Arena 3 was released on Steam on May 26, 2016, thirteen years after Robot Arena 2 was released. It has also been released on DVD-ROM Robot Arena 3 is built in the Unity 5 game engine; however, the developers encountered a setback with vehicular movement, eventually designing their own vehicle physics to accommodate a robot that has been flipped upside down. The game was panned heavily after release. \\"Early Access\\" players have complained about the clunky building, broken AI, lack of weight classes, glitched online, and not being able to edit a robot after it has been uploaded to the Steam workshop. The game has now been released fully and while players think it is better than it was in Early Access, they still believe the game is a disappointment.

Its predecessors were governed by the Archdiocese of Paderborn. In the 14th century the Bishopric of Paderborn was formed, which in turn became part of the Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle from the 16th century onward. From 1802 until 1807 the Bishopric was occupied by the Kingdom of Prussia, whereafter it fell to the Kingdom of Westphalia. In 1813 this kingdom fell apart, and in 1815 the Prussian Kingdom reoccupied the area. In this period Prussia instituted new administrative divisions which, in a modified form, can still be found today. Thus the area became a member of the newly founded administrative district of Minden in the Province of Westphalia. In 1816, in the process of forming the new Districts of Germany, Alfen, Nordborchen, Kirchborchen and D√∂renhagen were integrated into the district of Paderborn, whereas Etteln became a member of the district of B√ºren. In 1969, the municipalities Alfen, Nordborchen and Kirchborchen merged, forming the municipality of Borchen. Finally, on January 1, 1975, Etteln and D√∂renhangen joined Borchen.

The North Wing, South Wing, Chadwick Building and Pearson Building are also considered part of the main UCL building. The UCL Main Building is the centre of the UCL campus South Cloisters North Cloisters, UCL (1980s) The UCL Front Quad, part of the main campus, in front of the Slade School of Fine Art and the Main Building housing the Library, the astronomy shed is to the right with a sliding roof  History  In 1827, a year after the founding of UCL, construction of the main building began on the site of the old Carmarthen Square. The Octagon Building is a term used for the whole of the main building, but more commonly for a central part of it. At the centrepiece of the building is an ornate dome, which is visible throughout the immediate area. The Octagon was designed by the Architect William Wilkins, who also designed the National Gallery. The original plans by Wilkins called for a U-shaped enclosure around the quad. Funds, however, ran out in 1829 with only the portico and dome finished. Wilkins' original plans were not completed until the 20th century: The Main Building was finally finished in 1985, 158 years since the foundations were laid, with a formal opening ceremony by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom.  Octagon  The Wilkins Building is a term used for the whole of the Main Building, but more commonly for a central part of it. The Octagon dome houses the central hall of the University Main Library, which contains casts from the John Flaxman casts collection, and a mural depicting the construction of UCL in a mythical scene with Jeremy Bentham overlooking the plans.  Front Quad  Facing Gower Street, the Front Quadrangle, abbrievated as the \\"Quad\\", is an enclosed square of paths, grass and a few disabled car parking bays. There are a large number of benches as well as two decommissioned astronomy observatories.  Cloisters  The enclosed north and south cloisters connect the Octagon dome to the north and south wings of the quad respectively. They are one of the main thoroughfares of the College, and accommodate a series of exhibitions and events throughout the year (for example shows from students of the Slade School of Art and from the UCL special collections). To the north of the north cloisters is the Housman Room, which is a staff common room. The auto-icon of Jeremy Bentham was located in the south of the south cloisters up until February 2020 when he was permanently relocated to the public atrium of the Student Centre.  Wilkins Building  The Wilkins Building refers specifically to the part of the building built during the lifetime of the architect William Wilkins. It does not include the later, U-shaped extensions around the Quad. Although these were designed by Wilkins they were not finished until 1985. Therefore the Wilkins Building refers to the oldest sections of the Main Building: the centre part of the main building which includes the UCL Main Library, the dome, the Flaxman Gallery and the Cloisters. The Wilkins Building (along with the south wing built in 1869‚Äì76, the north wing built in 1870‚Äì81 and parts of the west side built over 1912‚Äì52) is grade I listed; the two observatories in the quad are grade II listed.  Main Library  The Main Library contains UCL's collections relating to arts and humanities, history, economics, public policy and law.UCL Library Services ‚Äì Main Library The Flaxman Gallery, a collection of sculptures and paintings by artist John Flaxman, is located inside the Main Library in the Octagon Building under UCL's central dome.

Geography Centinela Avenue is a major thoroughfare in Culver City, Inglewood, Ladera Heights, Mar Vista, Santa Monica, and West Los Angeles. It is named after the 19th century Rancho Aguaje de la Centinela, whose site of former ranchlands it passes through. Route The street runs primarily north/south, with a southern east/west section. Centinela Avenue is not a continuous street but is separated into two parts, the northern and southern sections, with a jog connected by Ocean Park Boulevard. =Northern section= The northern section of Centinela Avenue is a minor two lane street. It begins near the Brentwood Country Club in Brentwood, Los Angeles.(it had an earlier designation of Cambridge St.) It proceeds south, ending at Ocean Park Boulevard and the Santa Monica Airport, a block west of the southern section of Centinela Avenue. It is the official dividing line between the cities of Santa Monica and Los Angeles. This section of Centinela has two discontinuities. Going north, staying on Centinela requires a half- block jog west at Olympic Boulevard, and another half-block jog northeast at Wilshire Boulevard. =Southern section= The southern section of Centinela Avenue is a four lane major thoroughfare. It starts off as Bundy Drive at Sunset Boulevard in Brentwood, passing through West Los Angeles to the Santa Monica Airport, where at Stanwood Drive its name changes to Centinela Avenue. At its intersection with Jefferson Boulevard, Centinela Avenue angles southeastward to become an east/west street. It runs parallel to/on the south of Slauson Avenue. Centinela Avenue ends at the intersection with Florence Avenue in Inglewood. Centinela Park and Centinela Hospital Medical Center are located within here. Public transport The north-south portion of the avenue is served by Santa Monica Transit line 14 and the west-east portion by Metro Local line 110. The Bundy/Expo Metro station of the Metro E Line is located on Bundy Drive south of Olympic Boulevard. Notable residents Nicole Brown Simpson lived at 875 South Bundy Drive with her and O.J.

Biography His father, Zayd ibn Asim, was one of the first in Yathrib to accept Islam and his mother, Nusaybah bint Kab(Umm Ammarah) was the first woman to fight in defence of Islam. Habib accompanied his parents, aunt and brother to Mecca with the group of 75 people who pledged loyalty to Muhammad at Aqabah. Habib did not participate in the battle of Badr or the battle of Uhud because he was considered too young to bear arms. Thereafter, however, he took part in all the engagements which Muhammad fought, distinguishing himself by his bravery. Death By 630 Islam was the dominant force in Arabia, and the tribes converged on Mecca to proclaim their acceptance of Islam, including a delegation from Najd called Banu Hanifah, who appointed Musailama ibn Habib as their spokesman. On his return to Najd, Musailama recanted his allegiance, claiming to be a prophet himself. For various reasons the Banu Hanilab rallied around him, mostly out of tribal loyalty (asabiyyah). One member of the tribe declared: > \\"I testify that Muhammad is indeed truthful and that Musaylamah is indeed an > imposter. But the impostor of Rabiah (the tribal confederation to which the > Banu Hanifah belonged) is dearer to me that the genuine and truthful person > from Mudar (the tribal confederation to which the Quraish belonged).\\" Before long, the number of Musailama's followers increased and he felt powerful enough to write a letter to Muhammad; > \\"From Musailama, the messenger of God to Muhammad, the messenger of God. > Peace be on you. I am prepared to share this mission with you. I shall have > (control over) half the land and you shall have the other half. But the > Quraish are an aggressive people.\\" He then wrote to Musailama: \\"In the name > of God, the Beneficent, the Compassionate. From Muhammad the Messenger of > God, to Musailama the imposter. Peace be upon whoever follows the guidance. > God will bequeath the earth to whosoever of His servants He wishes and the > final triumph will be for those who are careful of their duty to God.\\" Musaylamah's influence spread and Muhammad chose Habib ibn Zayd to deliver another letter inviting him to abandon his claims. He presented the letter, which angered Musailama who ordered Habib chained and brought before him the following day. On the following day, Musailama presided over his assembly with his senior advisers and common people. He then ordered Habib to be brought before him and asked him if he believed Muhammad is the Messenger of God, which he affirmed. Musailama then asked > \\"And do you testify that I am the Messenger of God?\\" To which Habib replied > \\"My ears have been blocked against hearing what you claim.\\" Musailama then > ordered his executioner to sever one of Habib‚Äôs limbs. He then questioned > him again and Habib's answers were the same. Musailama thereupon ordered his > henchman to cut off another part of Habib's body, which fell to the ground > beside the other severed limb. Faced with Musaylamah's persistent > questioning and the blows of his henchman, Habib kept on repeating: \\"I > testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God.\\" Habib could not survive this > torture much longer and he soon died. News of Habib's death reached his > mother who said: \\"It was for such a situation that I prepared him... He > pledged allegiance to [Muhammad] on the night of Aqabah as a small child and > today as an adult he has given his life for [Muhammad]. If God were to allow > me to get near to Musailama, I would certainly make his daughters smite > their cheeks and lament over him.\\" The day she wished for arrived after the death of Muhammad when Abu Bakr declared war on the imposter. The Muslim army that confronted the forces of Musailama included Habib's mother Nusaybah and his brother Abdullah ibn Zayd. At the Battle of Yamamah she was seen cutting through the ranks of soldiers. When she eventually reached Musaylamah, he had already been killed by Wahshy ibn harb and her son Habib was avenged. At Habib's death, Muhammad had commended him and his entire family and had prayed: \\"May God bless this household. May God have mercy on this household.\\" Sources *Hadrat Umar Farooq, Prof. Masudul Hasan, Islamic Publications Lahore Category:Companions of the Prophet ","title":"Habib ibn Zayd al-Ansari"},{"id":"4109914","text":"Redding is an American indie rock band from Belleville, Illinois, near St. Louis, Missouri. Redding take their name from the character Ellis Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) in the film The Shawshank Redemption. The band consists of: *Joey Graves: lead vocals, guitar *Jeff McCullough: bass guitar, piano/keyboard, backing vocals *Danny Gula: guitar *Jon Stamm: drums/percussion History= Origin and early years (1999 ‚Äì 2003)  Learning to play music together in middle school, Joey Graves, Jon Stamm, and Danny Gula donned the name For the Moment for their developing garage band. Graves found himself at the helm of writing and recording the music (in the band‚Äôs home studio), and Stamm wrote the majority of the lyrics. In the spring of 2004, the trio began work on a four-song EP album. Graves tapped his first cousin, Jeff McCullough, to join the band and play bass guitar and piano. McCullough‚Äôs formal music training and experience in previous bands allowed him to become a major creative force in the developing group. Sinclair Aircraft EP (2004) On May 8, 2004 (two weeks before Graves, Stamm, and Gula graduated high school), For the Moment released the resultant home-recordings as an album called Sinclair Aircraft EP. The band sold all 300 copies before school ended. Most importantly, a copy of the Sinclair Aircraft EP came to the attention of Tom Derr (owner of Rock Ridge Music, who expressed interest in signing For the Moment to his label. But first, Derr and co-owner Chris Henderson (guitarist in alternative rock group 3 Doors Down) requested additional music. The band quickly wrote and recorded an early version of ‚ÄúGleam‚Äù, which helped seal a contract with Rock Ridge Music. In the fall, Graves, Gula, and Stamm started school at Southwestern Illinois College as music majors. Redding (2005 - 2008) Redding, 2006.On January 5, 2005, the band changed its name to Redding, and began a recording session at Chris Henderson‚Äôs Rivergate Studios in Biloxi, Mississippi. Kirk Kelsey (producer, Creed) produced, engineered, and mixed the project. On August 6, the band performed at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater for a crowd of nearly 20,000 before Staind and 3 Doors Down. In the week following, and again in October, Redding resumed and then completed recording at Greenville College. The band‚Äôs eponymous eight track debut album was released on July 11, 2006. It contains two re-recorded tracks from the Sinclair Aircraft EP -- ‚ÄúAll I Can Hold‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat You‚Äôve Become‚Äù. A month later, Graves, Stamm, and Gula began studying Digital Media at Greenville College (the program from which McCullough had graduated in 2003).

Several are described, with references, in a section of the article on De La Salle Brothers. Branches of the De La Salle Brothers admitted to these cases, and issued apologies publicly and to victims. The Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry in its report on physical and sexual abuse at the De La Salle Boys' Home at Rubane House considered \\"the extent and frequency of the abuse was such that it was systemic\\" and that \\"the [La Salle] Order's failings to properly investigate allegations of sexual abuse and to properly report them to relevant authorities and its failure to take proper steps to protect children from further sexual abuse\\" amounted to \\"a systemic failure to take appropriate steps to ensure the investigation and prosecution of criminal offences involving abuse\\".

The first festival was held in 1989 on the open lawn in the center of the city, and has grown into the largest free jazz festival on the East Coast. The event is held to keep alive the memory of Clifford Brown who died in a traffic accident in 1956 along with pianist Richie Powell.

The song was originally released as a B-side on the \\"Gump\\" single, and was later re-released as its own single. It has never appeared on one of Yankovic's studio albums, but was included as a track on the Medium Rarities disc of his Squeeze Box boxed set. Music video The opening title sequence to the actual film Spy Hard is a pastiche of the title sequences from the James Bond films designed by Maurice Binder - specifically 1965's Thunderball, complete with multiple colored backgrounds, silhouetted figures, and \\"wavy\\" text. The song itself was a pastiche of songs used during such James Bond title sequences, complete with an orchestra (conducted by Bill Conti, who composed the music for the 1981 Bond film For Your Eyes Only) and spy-themed lyrics. An urban legend states that during the recording of the theme to Thunderball, Tom Jones held the song's final note long enough to pass out; in this film, Yankovic holds it long enough to make his head explode. Originally, Yankovic had planned to loop the note to the required length, but in the studio, he discovered he was able to hold the note long enough that no looping was required. During the music video, Yankovic interacts with the titles twice. The first time occurs when the film's title is smacked away by Yankovic as he rises up into the shot. The second time, Yankovic glances towards his name as he is credited for the opening titles, proudly smirking immediately after. These are the only titles to appear in the video included on music video collections. The sequence was later included on \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic: The Videos, then again on \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection. While he had permission to include the title sequence (which he had directed), he did not have permission to use the actual printed credits from the film. Therefore, all names and titles had to be taken out, thus making the video slightly confusing. When released on \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic: The Ultimate Video Collection the title of the film and his credit were put back in. Another version of the opening title sequence was released that contained multiple clips from the actual film. End credits version There is an alternate version of the song, which is played during the end credits of Spy Hard where the lyrics are changed from \\"The name of this movie is Spy Hard / They call it Spy Hard / You're watching Spy Hard / It's the theme from Spy Hard!\\" to \\"The name of this movie was Spy Hard / They called it Spy Hard / You just saw Spy Hard / It's the end of Spy Hard!\\" This version has never been commercially released.

Described as an ‚Äúalt-rock guerrilla kids' dance party, forged in the crucible of Washington, D.C. cable-access television‚Äù, it is notable for featuring many punk rock/indie rock musicians like The White Stripes, Eddie Vedder, Fat Mike, The Melvins, Kings of Leon, Henry Rollins, Shirley Manson, Gerard Way, Daniel Johnston, Tegan and Sara, Katy Perry, Bright Eyes, Deerhoof, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, The Fiery Furnaces, Thievery Corporation, Arcade Fire, Built to Spill, Jenny Lewis, Metric, Starcrawler and many others. The show is hosted by a goat puppet named Rufus Leaking, superhero Captain Perfect and his slightly more sensible foil Garnett who serve as interviewers and dance-party impresarios. Interviews have included George Clinton, Juliette Lewis, and Chuck Leavell among others. Anti-Flag performed the theme song on the original 12 DVD episodes. History During an interview with CNN correspondent Heidi Collins, Scott Stuckey had this to say about the origin of the name for the show: > ... Musician friend, Brendan Canty (ph), had written a song called \\"Pancake > Mountain\\" and knew I was doing the show, and thought that it would be a good > song for the show. And when I listened to it, I was like a name‚Äîthis‚Äîwe > should name the show that. It was just an amazing song. And so the song kind > of came first, then the > name.http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0403/14/sm.05.html The majority of the show is filmed in Washington, D.C. and Arlington, Virginia, but the crew has been known to be fond of road trips and appear at such music festivals as SXSW, Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and the Virgin Fest. Many of the early episodes were partially written with Fugazi frontman Ian MacKaye. As of 2009 Pancake Mountain had completed twelve episodes and can be seen on public-access television in New York City, Virginia, North Carolina, Florida, Texas, Colorado, and Washington State. Filming for the show moved to Los Angeles in late 2008. In 2010, Stuckey got a call from director JJ Abrams, who signed on to produce the show through his production company Bad Robot. Abrams and Stuckey spent a year pitching the show to various networks, but nobody picked it up. Stuckey recalls \\"everyone wanted to try and fit us into a specific demographic, but we weren't willing to change the format\\" so Stuckey and Bad Robot ended their relationships on good terms. In 2011, Pancake Mountain decided to stop production. In April 2014, The New York Times reported that PBS would start licensing new episodes of Pancake Mountain through their online platform, PBS Digital Studios. The first episode premiered on June 9, 2014. It contained a new version of the original theme song performed by Brody Dalle of The Distillers. Stuckey stated that PBS had given him and co-producer J.R. Soldano complete creative control of the show, and that had been a deciding factor in bringing the show back. Rufus Leaking Rufus Leaking is a fictional character (puppet) who is the star of Pancake Mountain. He was created by director Scott Stuckey and voiced by producer J.R. Soldano. His dialogue was written by both Stuckey and Soldano. The name is taken from Dave Schools, who would use it as an alias when checking into hotels while on tour. Rufus is most famous for his interviews and sing-along duets with musical performers like The White Stripes and Henry Rollins .

Life Brown was the son of a Presbyterian minister and the grandson of theologian and Presbyterian minister Cleland Boyd McAfee. He earned a bachelor's degree from Amherst College in 1943 and was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1944. Brown earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree from Union Theological Seminary in 1945, and served as a United States Navy chaplain from 1945 to 1946. The recipient of a Fulbright grant, Brown studied at the University of Oxford before completing a doctorate in the philosophy of religion at Columbia University in 1951. He married Sydney Thomson, and had four children. Initially, Brown taught at his alma mater, Union Theological Seminary, before accepting an appointment as Professor of Religion at Stanford University in 1962. There he became an international leader in civil rights, ecumenical and social justice causes. Brown campaigned against U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War and was a co- founder of the group \\"Clergy and Laity Concerned about Vietnam\\". He was also a Protestant observer at the Second Vatican Council. Brown left Stanford in 1975 to return to Union as Professor of World Christianity and Ecumenism, but quickly found his new post unfulfilling. He resigned and moved back to the Bay Area, where he taught at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley until his retirement in 1984. Brown was the author of 29 books, and his papers are now held at the Graduate Theological Union.http://www.gtuarchives.org/rmb- overview.html Brown died on 4 September 2001, survived by his wife Sydney Thomson Brown, three sons, Peter, Mark and Tom and a daughter, Alison Ehara- Brown.

The Swedish Railway Museum has been located in G√§vle since 1970. The Museum has the use of two yards with tracks and several large buildings, including two round loco sheds and a sizeable workshop. The complex covers a total area of some 16,000 square metres. Collections Some items for the collection had already been acquired by the end of the 19th century. The present collection, which is one of the finest of its kind in the world, contains more than 100 locomotives, some 150 coaches, and several hundred other items of rolling stock. The best of these are displayed in the basic exhibition. Although most of the other items are kept in the stores, they are available for viewing by groups or by pre-arrangement. Apart from locomotives and rolling stock, tools, instruments, and models, as well as crockery, textiles and art in specially built settings are displayed at the museum. Photographs form an exciting pathway into historical times. The museum collection of photographs contains several hundred thousand pictures, and the museum is currently transferring copies of negatives, glass plates into digital form to make them more available for the public.

Re-release  In 2016 Robotic Empire reissued a limited edition version of Canada Songs on cassette. The track list also included the four tracks from Daughter's debut EP, Daughters as bonus tracks.  Reception  Mat Hocking May of Drowned in Sound stated the album is \\"It‚Äôs nothing short of intense\\" and \\"a rabid cut ‚Äòn‚Äô slash firebomb of splintered art-core and lacerating guitar shrieks\\". May also praises Daughters' approach to the album saying \\"Daughters‚Äô chaotically freeform approach reconfigures the way melody and noise is assimilated through some of the most fiercely challenging experimentation probably ever attempted.\\" Kerrang called the band a \\"A seditious delight\\" and stated \\"When you play chaotic art-core at blistering speed, there's a fine line between being inventive and exhilarating and being vapid and pointless. Thankfully, Daughters fall firmly into the former camp\\". Dan Perrone of Punknews compared the album to grindcore in general and later said '[they are] not like most grind music\\". Perrone also praised the guitar playing \\"The guitars on Canada Songs are what makes this band worth listening to\\". Perrone finished his review saying \\"It's truly mind-blowing music, but like most grind, it loses value rather quickly after a few listens.\\" Spin magazine praised drummer Jon Syverson's fast way of playing, \\"Slap-happy metallic grind punk with a drummer who grooves like Roy Jones Jr. working over a kitchen full of pots and pans in 14/8 time. There are even oddly melodic moments, despite guitars that sound like busted car alarms, and at 11 minutes total, there's no wasted motion\\". Cory of Lambgoat talked about the album's variety stating \\"There isn't an amazing variety from track to track\\". He also mentioned his dislike of the way the album was presented stating \\"My major problem with this disc (besides length) is the sort of pretension and pomposity with which it is presented. The Daughters' press release reads like the work of a grad student trying to impress his peers with big words and obscure philosophical references\\". Despite the seemly negative review he scored the album a 7/10 and described the album as \\"an excellent ten minutes of spastic grind and discordant chaos\\".

In classical philosophy, there were various ways in which things could be distinguished. The merely logical or virtual distinction, such as the difference between concavity and convexity, involves the mental apprehension of two definitions, but which cannot be realized outside the mind, as any concave line would be a convex line considered from another perspective. A real distinction involves a level of ontological separation, as when squirrels are distinguished from llamas (for no squirrel is a llama, and no llama is a squirrel). A real distinction is thus different than a merely conceptual one, in that in a real distinction, one of the terms can be realized in reality without the other being realized. Later developments include Duns Scotus's formal distinction, which developed in part out of the recognition in previous authors that there need to be an intermediary between logical and real distinctions. Some relevant distinctions to the history of Western philosophy include: * Necessity and contingency * Inductive and Deductive  Distinctions in contemporary thought = Analytic‚Äìsynthetic distinction  While there are anticipation of this distinction prior to Kant in the British Empiricists (and even further in Scholastic thought), it was Kant who introduced the terminology. The distinction concerns the relation of a subject to its predicate: analytic claims are those in which the subject contains the predicate, as in \\"All bodies are extended.\\" Synthetic claims bring two concepts together, as in \\"All events are caused.\\" The distinction was recently called into question by W.V.O. Quine, in his paper \\"Two Dogmas of Empiricism.\\"  A priori and a posteriori  The origins of the distinction are less clear, and it concerns the origins of knowledge. A posteriori knowledge arises from, or is caused by, experience. A priori knowledge may come temporally after experience, but its certainty is not derivable from the experience itself. Saul Kripke was the first major thinker to propose that there are analytic a posteriori knowledge claims.  Notable distinctions in historical authors = Aristotle  Aristotle makes the distinction between actuality and potentiality. Actuality is a realization of the way a thing could be, while potency refers simply to the way a thing could be. There are two levels to each: matter itself can be anything, and becomes something actually by causes, making it something which then has the ability to be in a certain way, and that ability can then be realized. The matter of an ax can be an ax, then is made into an ax. The ax thereby is able to cut, and reaches a new form of actuality in actually cutting.  Aquinas  The major distinction Aquinas makes is that of essence and existence. It is a distinction already in Avicenna, but Aquinas maps the distinction onto the actuality/potentiality distinction of Aristotle, such that the essence of a thing is in potency to the existence of a thing, which is that thing's actuality.  Kant  In Kant, the distinction between appearance and thing-in-itself is foundational to his entire philosophical project. The distinction separates the way a thing appears to us on the one hand, and the way a thing really is.

The black comedy Christmas song is performed as a pastiche of \\"Black Gold\\" by Soul Asylum. It has melodic references to \\"Black Gold\\", \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\" by Ozzy Osbourne, and \\"I Believe in Father Christmas\\" by Greg Lake. It is the twelfth and final track on the album Bad Hair Day, released as a single during the 1996 Christmas season. \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\" is on the compilation album The Essential \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic. Both albums have received positive critical reviews. Lyrics The song starts with Santa's elves making Christmas presents for good, \\"Gentile\\" children. Suddenly, a drunken Santa bursts in with a rifle in his hand, and covered with ammunition. He says, \\"Merry Christmas to all / Now you're all gonna die!\\", then proceeds to destroy half of the North Pole, hold the elves and helpers hostage, and kill reindeer. The National Guard and FBI come to restore order. Santa is arrested and locked up in a federal prison, with the possibility of release for good behavior in 700 years. Vixen is taking therapy while Donner has post-traumatic stress disorder, the elves get jobs working for the postal service, and Mrs. Claus negotiates film rights for the incident. Santa had gone crazy because he was sick of milk and cookies being the only reward for all his hard work. Release \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\" was released as the third and final single from Bad Hair Day on November 26, 1996; the CD single features \\"The Night Santa Went Crazy\\" and \\"Christmas at Ground Zero\\", another holiday-themed song from Yankovic's 1986 album Polka Party!. The cover art displays the original drawing of Santa Claus by Mark Osborne that inspired Yankovic to write the song. Though the single did not chart upon original release, it later peaked at number 35 on the United States Billboard Holiday Digital Tracks chart in 2010. An \\"extra gory\\" version of the song was included as the third track on the \\"Amish Paradise\\" single. In this version, Vixen and Donner are not mentioned (leaving their fate ambiguous), Santa is killed by a member of the SWAT team, and the elves file for unemployment benefits. Another rendition combining elements of the album and the \\"extra gory\\" versions was written for Yankovic's Touring with Scissors tour in 1999; it is featured on the \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic Live! video album.

Greatheart Silver is a 1982 science fiction novel written by Philip Jos√© Farmer. It is a collection of three of Farmer's stories from the series Weird Heroes published in the 1970s with the title character, a lineal descendant of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings, working for the Acme Zeppelin Corporation as a blimp pilot and private detective. Plot summary Greatheart Silver, the thirty-year-old first mate on Acme Zeppelin 8, is the sole survivor of an attack by the Mad Fokker, an air pirate and World War I veteran who was mothballed by the United States government because it could not undo his mental conditioning. Bendt Micawber (the CEO of Acme Corporation and the descendant of Mr. Micawber from David Copperfield) cites his survival as dereliction of duty. Receiving a plastic prosthetic leg as well as his pension as compensation, Greatheart is fired from Acme. During his recovery, Greatheart's fiancee breaks up with him and his Sioux grandmother sends him a birdcage with two ravens inside. He names them Huginn and Muninn after the Norse god Odin's all-seeing ravens. Using his skills with computers to alter his records and receive a glowing reference from Micawber, Greatheart is soon employed by the Phoenix branch of Acme Security-Southwest. Under the tutelage of Fenwick Phwombly (who describes himself, though is never identified, as the Shadow), Greatheart journeys to the town of Shootout, where many aging villains have gathered for a last great crime. However, they are stopped by a group of aging heroes including Phwombly in an action similar to the gunfight at the OK Corral. Two years later, Greatheart (named for the character in Pilgrim's Progress) is disguised as an employee of Acme W-W Cleaners and narrowly avoids averting a kidnapping. The victim of the terrorist group turns out to be Micawber's estranged daughter, Jill Micawber, who went under an assumed name so she would not be associated with her ruthless father. Greatheart traces the kidnappers, despite the efforts of Micawber to trail him, to the Fokker D-LXIX Press building, specializers in erotica owned by Acme Zeppelin. Using a DRECC computer, executive Rade Starling can transform any printed work into a sensually appealing one (e.g. Glinda of Oz becomes The Secret Life of Glinda of Oz, or The Good Witch Goes Bad) and after knocking Greatheart out reveals his plan, with a microchip embedded in the books' front covers, to overwhelm readers' emotions and make them euphoric and suggestible. With the help of Jill, a previous acquaintance of his from UCLA, Greatheart enables Starling's project to overwhelm him and his associates. Since the project was conducted on Acme- owned property, Greatheart has sufficient blackmail on Micawber to prevent his harassing him again. With Jill's leverage, Greatheart marries her and (with Micawber's grudging blessing) becomes captain of Acme Zeppelin 49. On a trans- Pacific journey to Minerva with a cargo of iridium and platinum, another group of kidnappers attempts to abduct Jill and encounters a Brittany separatist group on board. When gunshots go off and penetrate the airbag as well as short out the computers on the bridge, the groups must work together to reach land.

Formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, it was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile-1), and the first designed and built for continuous operation. It was built during World War II as part of the Manhattan Project. While Chicago Pile-1 demonstrated the feasibility of nuclear reactors, the Manhattan Project's goal of producing enough plutonium for atomic bombs required reactors a thousand times as powerful, along with facilities to chemically separate the plutonium bred in the reactors from uranium and fission products. An intermediate step was considered prudent. The next step for the plutonium project, codenamed X-10, was the construction of a semiworks where techniques and procedures could be developed and training conducted. The centerpiece of this was the X-10 Graphite Reactor. It was air- cooled, used nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator, and pure natural uranium in metal form for fuel. DuPont commenced construction of the plutonium semiworks at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge on February 2, 1943. The reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, and produced its first plutonium in early 1944. It supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with its first significant amounts of plutonium, and its first reactor-bred product. Studies of these samples heavily influenced bomb design. The reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the Hanford site. X-10 operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities, and the production of radioactive isotopes for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. It was shut down in 1963 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Origins The discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, followed by its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, opened up the possibility of a controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. At Columbia University, Enrico Fermi and Leo Szilard began exploring how this might be done. Szilard drafted a confidential letter to the President of the United States, Franklin D. Roosevelt, explaining the possibility of atomic bombs, and warning of the danger of a German nuclear weapon project. He convinced his old friend and collaborator Albert Einstein to co-sign it, lending his fame to the proposal. This resulted in support by the U.S. government for research into nuclear fission, which became the Manhattan Project. In April 1941, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) asked Arthur Compton, a Nobel-Prize-winning physics professor at the University of Chicago, to report on the uranium program. His report, submitted in May 1941, foresaw the prospects of developing radiological weapons, nuclear propulsion for ships, and nuclear weapons using uranium-235 or the recently discovered plutonium. In October he wrote another report on the practicality of an atomic bomb. Niels Bohr and John Wheeler had theorized that heavy isotopes with even atomic numbers and odd number of neutrons were fissile. If so, then plutonium-239 was likely to be. Emilio Segr√® and Glenn Seaborg at the University of California produced 28 Œºg of plutonium in the 60-inch cyclotron there in May 1941, and found that it had 1.7 times the thermal neutron capture cross section of uranium-235. At the time plutonium-239 had been produced in minute quantities using cyclotrons, but it was not possible to produce large quantities that way. Compton discussed with Eugene Wigner from Princeton University how plutonium might be produced in a nuclear reactor, and with Robert Serber how the plutonium produced in a reactor might be separated from uranium. The final draft of Compton's November 1941 report made no mention of using plutonium, but after discussing the latest research with Ernest Lawrence, Compton became convinced that a plutonium bomb was also feasible. In December, Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, which was codenamed X-10. Its objectives were to produce reactors to convert uranium to plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate the plutonium from the uranium, and to design and build an atomic bomb. It fell to Compton to decide which of the different types of reactor designs the scientists should pursue, even though a successful reactor had not yet been built. He felt that having teams at Columbia, Princeton, the University of Chicago and the University of California was creating too much duplication and not enough collaboration, and he concentrated the work at the Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. Site selection By June 1942, the Manhattan Project had reached the stage where the construction of production facilities could be contemplated. On June 25, 1942, the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) S-1 Executive Committee deliberated on where they should be located. Moving directly to a megawatt production plant looked like a big step, given that many industrial processes do not easily scale from the laboratory to production size. An intermediate step of building a pilot plant was considered prudent. For the pilot plutonium separation plant, a site was wanted close to the Metallurgical Laboratory, where the research was being carried out, but for reasons of safety and security, it was not desirable to locate the facilities in a densely populated area like Chicago. Compton selected a site in the Argonne Forest, part of the Forest Preserve District of Cook County, about southwest of Chicago. The full-scale production facilities would be co-located with other Manhattan Project facilities at a still more remote location in Tennessee. Some of land was leased from Cook County for the pilot facilities, while an site for the production facilities was selected at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. By the S-1 Executive Committee meeting on September 13 and 14, it had become apparent that the pilot facilities would be too extensive for the Argonne site, so instead a research reactor would be built at Argonne, while the plutonium pilot facilities (a semiworks) would be built at the Clinton Engineer Works in Tennessee. This site was selected on the basis of several criteria. The plutonium pilot facilities needed to be from the site boundary and any other installation, in case radioactive fission products escaped. While security and safety concerns suggested a remote site, it still needed to be near sources of labor, and accessible by road and rail transportation. A mild climate that allowed construction to proceed throughout the year was desirable. Terrain separated by ridges would reduce the impact of accidental explosions, but they could not be so steep as to complicate construction. The substratum needed to be firm enough to provide good foundations, but not so rocky that it would hinder excavation work. It needed large amounts of electrical power (available from the Tennessee Valley Authority) and cooling water. Finally, a War Department policy held that, as a rule, munitions facilities should not be located west of the Sierra or Cascade Ranges, east of the Appalachian Mountains, or within of the Canadian or Mexican borders. In December, it was decided that the plutonium production facilities would not be built at Oak Ridge after all, but at the even more remote Hanford Site in Washington state. Compton and the staff at the Metallurgical Laboratory then reopened the question of building the plutonium semiworks at Argonne, but the engineers and management of DuPont, particularly Roger Williams, the head of its TNX Division, which was responsible for the company's role in the Manhattan Project, did not support this proposal. They felt that there would be insufficient space at Argonne, and that there were disadvantages in having a site that was so accessible, as they were afraid that it would permit the research staff from the Metallurgical Laboratory to interfere unduly with the design and construction, which they considered their prerogative. A better location, they felt, would be with the remote production facilities at Hanford. In the end a compromise was reached. On January 12, 1943, Compton, Williams, and Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the Manhattan Project, agreed that the semiworks would be built at the Clinton Engineer Works. Both Compton and Groves proposed that DuPont operate the semiworks. Williams counter-proposed that the semiworks be operated by the Metallurgical Laboratory. He reasoned that it would primarily be a research and educational facility, and that expertise was to be found at the Metallurgical Laboratory. Compton was shocked; the Metallurgical Laboratory was part of the University of Chicago, and therefore the university would be operating an industrial facility from its main campus. James B. Conant told him that Harvard University \\"wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole\\", but the University of Chicago's Vice President, Emery T. Filbey, took a different view, and instructed Compton to accept. When University President Robert Hutchins returned, he greeted Compton with \\"I see, Arthur, that while I was gone you doubled the size of my university\\". Design Diagram of the reactor alt=Building site, with materials lying about The fundamental design decisions in building a reactor are the choice of fuel, coolant and neutron moderator. The choice of fuel was straightforward; only natural uranium was available. The decision that the reactor would use graphite as a neutron moderator caused little debate. Although with heavy water as moderator the number of neutrons produced for every one absorbed (known as k) was 10 percent more than in the purest graphite, heavy water would be unavailable in sufficient quantities for at least a year. This left the choice of coolant, over which there was much discussion. A limiting factor was that the fuel slugs would be clad in aluminum, so the operating temperature of the reactor could not exceed . The theoretical physicists in Wigner's group at the Metallurgical Laboratory developed several designs. In November 1942, the DuPont engineers chose helium gas as the coolant for the production plant, mainly on the basis that it did not absorb neutrons, but also because it was inert, which removed the issue of corrosion. Not everyone agreed with the decision to use helium. Szilard, in particular, was an early proponent of using liquid bismuth; but the major opponent was Wigner, who argued forcefully in favor of a water-cooled reactor design. He realized that since water absorbed neutrons, k would be reduced by about 3 percent, but had sufficient confidence in his calculations that the water-cooled reactor would still be able to achieve criticality. From an engineering perspective, a water-cooled design was straightforward to design and build, while helium posed technological problems. Wigner's team produced a preliminary report on water cooling, designated CE-140 in April 1942, followed by a more detailed one, CE-197, titled \\"On a Plant with Water Cooling\\", in July 1942. Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, constructed under the west viewing stands of the original Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, \\"went critical\\" on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified other aspects of the design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time to deal with them in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures. Construction Although the design of the reactor was not yet complete, DuPont began construction of the plutonium semiworks on February 2, 1943, on an isolated site in the Bethel Valley about southwest of Oak Ridge officially known as the X-10 area. The site included research laboratories, a chemical separation plant, a waste storage area, a training facility for Hanford staff, and administrative and support facilities that included a laundry, cafeteria, first aid center, and fire station. Because of the subsequent decision to construct water-cooled reactors at Hanford, only the chemical separation plant operated as a true pilot. The semiworks eventually became known as the Clinton Laboratories, and was operated by the University of Chicago as part of the Metallurgical Project. alt=Building site. A chimney has been erected and scaffolding has gone up. Construction work on the reactor had to wait until DuPont had completed the design. Excavation commenced on April 27, 1943. A large pocket of soft clay was soon discovered, necessitating additional foundations. Further delays occurred due to wartime difficulties in procuring building materials. There was an acute shortage of both common and skilled labor; the contractor had only three-quarters of the required workforce, and there was high turnover and absenteeism, mainly the result of poor accommodations and difficulties in commuting. The township of Oak Ridge was still under construction, and barracks were built to house workers. Special arrangements with individual workers increased their morale and reduced turnover. Finally, there was unusually heavy rainfall, with falling in July 1943, more than twice the average of . Some of graphite blocks were purchased from National Carbon. The construction crews began stacking them in September 1943. Cast uranium billets came from Metal Hydrides, Mallinckrodt and other suppliers. These were extruded into cylindrical slugs, and then canned. The fuel slugs were canned to protect the uranium metal from corrosion that would occur if it came into contact with water, and to prevent the venting of gaseous radioactive fission products that might be formed when they were irradiated. Aluminum was chosen as it transmitted heat well but did not absorb too many neutrons. Alcoa started canning on June 14, 1943. General Electric and the Metallurgical Laboratory developed a new welding technique to seal the cans airtight, and the equipment for this was installed in the production line at Alcoa in October 1943. Construction commenced on the pilot separation plant before a chemical process for separating plutonium from uranium had been selected. Not until May 1943 would DuPont managers decide to use the bismuth phosphate process in preference to one using lanthanum fluoride. The bismuth phosphate process was devised by Stanley G. Thompson at the University of California. Plutonium had two oxidation states; a tetravalent (+4) state, and hexavalent (+6) state, with different chemical properties. Bismuth phosphate () was similar in its crystalline structure to plutonium phosphate, and plutonium would be carried with bismuth phosphate in a solution while other elements, including uranium, would be precipitated. The plutonium could be switched from being in solution to being precipitated by toggling its oxidation state. The plant consisted of six cells, separated from each other and the control room by thick concrete walls. The equipment was operated from the control room by remote control due to the radioactivity produced by fission products. Work was completed on November 26, 1943, but the plant could not operate until the reactor started producing irradiated uranium slugs. Operation alt=Two workmen in overalls put a rod into a hole on the reactor face The X-10 Graphite Reactor was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor after Chicago Pile-1, and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. It consisted of a huge block, long on each side, of nuclear graphite cubes, weighing around , that acted as a moderator. They were surrounded by of high-density concrete as a radiation shield. In all, the reactor was wide, deep and high. There were 36 horizontal rows of 35 holes. Behind each was a metal channel into which uranium fuel slugs could be inserted. An elevator provided access to those higher up. Only 800 (~64%) of the channels were ever used. The reactor used cadmium-clad steel control rods. Made from neutron-absorbing cadmium, these could restrict or halt the reaction. Three rods penetrated the reactor vertically, held in place by a clutch to form the scram system. They were suspended from steel cables that were wound around a drum, and held in place by an electromagnetic clutch. If power was lost, they would drop into the reactor, halting it. The other four rods were made of boron steel and horizontally penetrated the reactor from the north side. Two of them, known as \\"shim\\" rods, were hydraulically controlled. Sand-filled hydraulic accumulators could be used in the event of a power failure. The other two rods were driven by electric motors. The cooling system consisted of three electric fans running at . Because it was cooled using outside air, the reactor could be run at a higher power level on cold days. After going through the reactor, the air was filtered to remove radioactive particles larger than in diameter. This took care of over 99 percent of the radioactive particles. It was then vented through a chimney. The reactor was operated from a control room in the southeast corner on the second floor. In September 1942, Compton asked a physicist, Martin D. Whitaker, to form a skeleton operating staff for X-10. Whitaker became the inaugural director of the Clinton Laboratories, as the semiworks became officially known in April 1943. The first permanent operating staff arrived from the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago in April 1943, by which time DuPont began transferring its technicians to the site. They were augmented by one hundred technicians in uniform from the Army's Special Engineer Detachment. By March 1944, there were some 1,500 people working at X-10. alt=A large four-storey building. The chimney is in the background. There are power poles and power lines in front. Supervised by Compton, Whitaker, and Fermi, the reactor went critical on November 4, 1943, with about of uranium. A week later the load was increased to , raising its power generation to 500 kW, and by the end of the month the first 500 mg of plutonium was created. The reactor normally operated around the clock, with 10-hour weekly shutdowns for refueling. During startup, the safety rods and one shim rod were completely removed. The other shim rod was inserted at a predetermined position. When the desired power level was reached, the reactor was controlled by adjusting the partly inserted shim rod. The first batch of canned slugs to be irradiated was received on December 20, 1943, allowing the first plutonium to be produced in early 1944. The slugs used pure metallic natural uranium, in air-tight aluminum cans long and in diameter. Each channel was loaded with between 24 and 54 fuel slugs. The reactor went critical with of slugs, but in its later life was operated with as much as . To load a channel, the radiation-absorbing shield plug was removed, and the slugs inserted manually in the front (east) end with long rods. To unload them, they were pushed all the way through to the far (west) end, where they fell onto a neoprene slab and fell down a chute into a pool of water that acted as a radiation shield. Following weeks of underwater storage to allow for decay in radioactivity, the slugs were delivered to the chemical separation building. alt=A control panel with lots of switches and meters By February 1944, the reactor was irradiating a ton of uranium every three days. Over the next five months, the efficiency of the separation process was improved, with the percentage of plutonium recovered increasing from 40 to 90 percent. Modifications over time raised the reactor's power to 4,000 kW in July 1944. The effect of the neutron poison xenon-135, one of many fission products produced from the uranium fuel, was not detected during the early operation of the X-10 Graphite Reactor. Xenon-135 subsequently caused problems with the startup of the Hanford B reactor that nearly halted the plutonium project. The X-10 semiworks operated as a plutonium production plant until January 1945, when it was turned over to research activities. By this time, 299 batches of irradiated slugs had been processed. A radioisotope building, a steam plant, and other structures were added in April 1946 to support the laboratory's peacetime educational and research missions. All work was completed by December 1946, adding another $1,009,000 to the cost of construction at X-10, and bringing the total cost to $13,041,000. Operational costs added another $22,250,000. X-10 supplied the Los Alamos Laboratory with the first significant samples of plutonium. Studies of these by Emilio G. Segr√® and his P-5 Group at Los Alamos revealed that it contained impurities in the form of the isotope plutonium-240, which has a far higher spontaneous fission rate than plutonium-239. This meant that it would be highly likely that a plutonium gun-type nuclear weapon would predetonate and blow itself apart during the initial formation of a critical mass. The Los Alamos Laboratory was thus forced to turn its development efforts to creating an implosion-type nuclear weapon‚Äîa far more difficult feat. The X-10 chemical separation plant also verified the bismuth-phosphate process that was used in the full-scale separation facilities at Hanford. Finally, the reactor and chemical separation plant provided invaluable experience for engineers, technicians, reactor operators, and safety officials who then moved on to the Hanford site. Peacetime use alt=Two workmen on a movable platform similar to that used by window washers, in front of a wall with arrays of holes and many wires running across it. A sign says \\"Graphite Reactor loading face\\". After the war ended, the graphite reactor became the first facility in the world to produce radioactive isotopes for peacetime use. On August 2, 1946, Oak Ridge National Laboratory director Eugene Wigner presented a small container of carbon-14 to the director of the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, for medical use at the hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Subsequent shipments of radioisotopes, primarily iodine-131, phosphorus-32, carbon-14, and molybdenum-99/technetium-99m, were for scientific, medical, industrial and agricultural uses. The X-10 Graphite Reactor was shut down on November 4, 1963, after twenty years of use. It was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, and and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In 1969 the American Society for Metals listed it as a landmark for its contributions to the advancement of materials science and technology, and in 2008 it was designated as a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society. The control room and reactor face are accessible to the public during scheduled tours offered through the American Museum of Science and Energy. Similar reactors The Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) Graphite Research Reactor was the first nuclear reactor to be constructed in the United States following World War II. Led by Lyle Benjamin Borst, the reactor construction began in 1947 and reached criticality for the first time on August 22, 1950. The reactor consisted of a , cube of graphite fueled by natural uranium. Its primary mission was applied nuclear research in medicine, biology, chemistry, physics and nuclear engineering. One of the most significant discoveries at this facility was the development of production of molybdenum-99/technetium-99m, used today in tens of millions of medical diagnostic procedures annually, making it the most commonly used medical radioisotope. The BNL Graphite Research Reactor was shut down in 1969 and fully decommissioned in 2012. When Britain began planning to build nuclear reactors to produce plutonium for weapons in 1946, it was decided to build a pair of air-cooled graphite reactors similar to the X-10 Graphite Reactor at Windscale. Natural uranium was used as enriched was not available, and similarly, graphite was chosen as a neutron moderator because beryllia was toxic and hard to manufacture, while heavy water was unavailable. Use of water as a coolant was considered, but there were concerns about the possibility of a catastrophic nuclear meltdown in the densely populated British Isles if the cooling system failed. Helium was again the preferred choice as a coolant gas, but the main source of it was the United States, and under the 1946 McMahon Act, the United States would not supply it for nuclear weapons production, so, in the end, air cooling was chosen. Construction began in September 1947, and the two reactors became operational in October 1950 and June 1951. Both were decommissioned after the disastrous Windscale fire in October 1957. They would be the last major air-cooled plutonium-producing reactors; the UK's follow-on Magnox and AGR designs used carbon dioxide instead. , another reactor of similar design to the X-10 Graphite Reactor is still in operation, the Belgian BR-1 reactor of the SCK‚Ä¢CEN, located in Mol, Belgium. Financed through the Belgian uranium export tax, and built with the help of British experts, the 4 MW research reactor went critical for the first time on May 11, 1956. It is used for scientific purposes, such as neutron activation analysis, neutron physics experiments, calibration of nuclear measurement devices and the production of neutron transmutation doped silicon.

The village lies close to the border with Staffordshire and is about 8 miles north of Newport and 5 miles south east of Market Drayton. At the 2001 Census, the parish (which also includes the villages of Chipnall and Soudley as well as several small hamlets such as Goldstone and Ellerton), had a population of 991 people, increasing to 1,076 at the 2011 Census.  History and architecture  The name Cheswardine, recorded in 1086 as Ciseworde, in 1189 as Chesewordin and about 1650 as Cheswardyne, is probably derived from the Old English for \\"cheese-producing settlement\\".Gelling and Foxall, The place-names of Shropshire, Volume 1, EPNS, 1990, p.78 Cheswardine was mentioned in the Domesday book, when the manor was held by Robert of Stafford, but is probably a much older settlement, with the church likely being built on an ancient fortified site.Raven, M. A Guide to Shropshire, 2005, p.46 Land north of the church was granted to Hamon le Strange in 1155 and a manor house surrounded by a moat built soon after. The manor were rebuilt as a small castle between 1250 and 1350. Ownership passed to the Earl of Arundel and Surrey in 1376. The moat, earthworks and some buried ruins remain and Cheswardine Castle was scheduled as a historical monument in 1976. The parish church, dedicated to St Swithun, overlooks Cheswardine from the hill at the top of the village. This is at least the third church on this site, and was rebuilt in 1887 - 1889 under the direction of the esteemed architect John Loughborough Pearson, who died before the work was completed. The work was completed with the assistance of funding by the then squire of the Cheswardine Estate, Charles Donaldson-Hudson, who evidently provided half of the estimated cost of ¬£8,500.

He belonged to a senior but impoverished branch of the Neville family of northern England, which had earlier been disinherited in favor of a younger branch headed by John's half‚Äìuncle, Richard, earl of Salisbury. John Neville and his brothers spent several years feuding with Salisbury over the contested inheritance and, when the dynastic wars broke out, John sided with the Lancastrians whilst the junior Nevilles sided with the House of York. John was a beneficiary of the spoils of war after the Yorkists fled England in 1459, being awarded many of his rival Neville cousins' confiscated lands and offices, and was also raised to the rank of baron. When Richard of York returned in 1460 and claimed the throne, Lord Neville initially posed as an ally, but went back to the Lancastrian side just before the Battle of Wakefield. York gave battle, likely thinking Neville would arrive to reinforce him, but was instead attacked and slain. Lord Neville himself, however, was killed shortly thereafter in an ambush leading up to the Battle of Towton in 1461. His son later inherited the earldom of Westmorland. Family and background Arms of Neville: Gules, a saltire argent He was born in about 1410, the second son of Sir John Neville (d. 1420) (eldest son and heir apparent of Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland by his first wife Margaret de Stafford) by his wife Elizabeth Holland (c.1388-1423), fifth daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent by his wife Alice FitzAlan (d.1416). He had two brothers, Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland, and Sir Thomas Neville (died 1458) of Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, and one sister, Margaret Neville, who married Sir William Lucy of Woodcroft, Bedfordshire. At sometime before 5 February 1442 he married (as her second husband) Anne Holland (d.1486), the daughter of John Holland, 2nd Duke of Exeter by his first wife Anne Stafford (a daughter of Edmund Stafford, 5th Earl of Stafford and the widow of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March). Anne Holland was the widow of his nephew Sir John Neville (d.1450), son of Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland by his first wife Lady Elizabeth Percy. Anne Holland outlived him and married thirdly to James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas (d.1491), but had no issue by him. She died 26 December 1486, and was buried in St. Anne's Chapel in the Blackfriars in the City of London. By Anne he had one son: *Ralph Neville, 3rd Earl of Westmorland son and heir and heir to his uncle the 2nd Earl. He obtained a reversal of his father's attainder on 6 October 1472. Life=Neville‚ÄìNeville rivalry In the 1430s, John Neville's older brother, the Earl of Westmorland, waged what was virtually a private war with their uncle, the Earl of Salisbury, and the Beaufort branch of the Neville family, regarding an inheritance dispute. John joined his brother and played an important part in the struggle. He was mentioned in a 1438 letter to the king's chancellor reporting that the rival Nevilles had \\"assembled great routs and companies upon the field\\", done \\"great and horrible offences\\" and engaged \\"in slaughter and destruction\\" of the northern English local populace. The dispute was an uneven one, for the Earl of Salisbury was wealthier and better connected with powerful members of the nobility and clergy, aside from also being a blood relation of the English royal family. Salisbury got the better end of the dispute, and the parties were outwardly reconciled in 1443, in a settlement that heavily favoured the earl. The senior Nevilles, for their part, continued to resent their cousins over the matter. This rivalry ensured that, in the factional and turbulent politics of the 1450s, each branch of the family took opposite sides: when Salisbury and his son the Earl of Warwick sided with Richard, Duke of York, the senior branch took the side of the House of Lancaster, thus merging the family feud into the larger Wars of the Roses. After the Neville settlement of 1443, the Earl of Westmorland appears to have largely given up his role in national politics, so it was his brother John whom the party of Queen Margaret of Anjou tried to recruit as an ally against the Duke of York and the earls of Salisbury and Warwick. Sir John Neville was summoned as a knight of the shire for the West Riding of Yorkshire to a great council which was to meet at Leicester on 21 May 1455. York, Salisbury and Warwick anticipated that charges would be brought against them at the meeting, so they intercepted and attacked the royal party at St Albans, their victory at which led to a brief protectorate by the Duke of York which lasted until February 1456. After the queen wrested back control over the government, she encouraged John Neville and his family to renew their rivalry in the north with York's ally, the Earl of Salisbury. In 1457, with the death of Salisbury's brother Robert, bishop of Durham, the queen secured the appointment of her man, Laurence Booth, to the vacant see. Booth (whose niece John's son later married) promptly began replacing Salisbury's relatives with members of the senior Neville branch in the administrative offices of the bishopric, with Sir John nominated justice of assize (becoming \\"the leading member of the Durham judiciary\\"). John also gained part of the goods sequestrated from the late bishop Robert. Breakout of war After the rout and flight of the Yorkist lords at Ludford in October 1459, Sir John Neville received substantial rewards comprising largely the forfeited estates and offices of the Earl of Salisbury. On 20 November 1459, he was raised to the peerage as Lord Neville by a writ of summons to parliament; this was the \\"Parliament of Devils\\", at which York and the junior Nevilles were attainted. On 19 December, \\"for good services against the rebels\\", he was appointed constable of Salisbury's castles of Middleham and Sheriff Hutton and steward of their associated lands, and was also granted a share of the forfeited lands of the Yorkist Sir John Conyers. In County Durham, Lord Neville became constable of Barnard Castle and master forester of Teesdale forest with an annuity of 40 marks. On 18 March 1460, he received another grant from Salisbury's empire: a yearly rent of 100 marks from the manors of Worton and Banbridge and the forest of Wensleydale. Lord John responded to this patronage by raising men for the Lancastrian cause before their defeat at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460. He appears to have initially acquiesced to the new regime established by the Earl of Warwick in the aftermath of the battle, being summoned to parliament on 30 July 1460 and gaining initial trust from the Yorkists, who do not seem to have considered him an irreconcilable enemy. Neville was absent from the Parliament in October at which Richard, Duke of York claimed the throne, but was given a commission to proceed against the Lancastrian \\"rebels\\" assembling in the north. He then joined them instead, attending the muster of Margaret of Anjou in Yorkshire and being among those who devastated the northern estates of the Yorkist lords. Still, the Yorkist government (appearing to be unaware of this) put him on a commission of oyer and terminer on 8 December. From Wakefield to Towton In December the Duke of York marched north in person to deal with the unexpectedly quick rising of the queen and her supporters. Under pretence of being an ally, Lord Neville visited him and received a commission to raise men on the duke's behalf, but joined the enemy with his recruits. He was thus with the Lancastrian party at the ensuing Battle of Wakefield, 30 December, where York was defeated and slain. John's uncle and enemy, the Earl of Salisbury, and his son Sir Thomas Neville were also killed. One theory explaining why Richard of York left the safety of Sandal Castle to confront the stronger Lancastrian host is that he thought John Neville would arrive to reinforce him, but Neville then instead switched sides as soon as the duke exposed himself. Lord Neville joined the queen's army which marched south and looted towns along the way. His troops in particular sacked Beverley on 12 January 1461. On the 20th, at York, John, his brother the Earl of Westmorland and other lords declared their approval of an agreement which entailed the cession of Berwick to the Scots in exchange for their support. Neville probably fought at the second Battle of St Albans on 17 February, where his cousin the Earl of Warwick, leading the Yorkists, was defeated. In March, the Yorkists once again marched north, now under the leadership of Richard of York's son Edward (proclaimed King Edward IV). Neville and his cousin Lord Clifford (whose grandmother was a Neville of the elder branch) commanded a force which ambushed the Yorkist vanguard under Warwick at the Battle of Ferrybridge at dawn on 28 March. While retreating north towards the main Lancastrian host, they were caught in a counter‚Äìambush by John Neville's uncle William, Lord Fauconberg (of the junior Neville branch), at a valley called Dintingdale, near the village of Saxton. Neville, Clifford and most of their force were killed. The Battle of Towton the following day secured the English throne for the House of York. Neville was attainted on 4 November 1461 and his lands escheated to the crown, leaving his widow unprovided for.

Its popularity as an image continues today with references and depictions in literature, film, television, and video games. Often, the giant squid is represented as being in dramatic, evenly matched combat with a sperm whale. This powerful image is no longer considered accurate given the evidence that exists for a simpler predator-prey relationship between whale and squid, with the whale being the predator and the squid the prey, though sucker scars have been seen on sperm whale skin.

Clones was created by independent game developer Tomkorp Computer Solutions as their first game. It features alien creatures named clones to which the player can assign a variety of morph commands which cause the clones to deform their body in order to navigate the terrain. Multiple game types are supported as well as both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. Gameplay The core gameplay of Clones is similar to Lemmings but includes several differences such as multiple game modes, networked multiplayer, a world ranking system, simple A.I., and a built-in level editor. Primarily a 2D game, Clones uses a 3D camera to display the Clones planet (single-player worldmap) and to allow zooming and rotation of the 2D landscape. The player cannot control the clones directly, except for the mutated light clone, and must issue morphs to the clones which deform their bodies and allow them to perform 10 different actions to help navigate the landscape. Game modes The clones are grouped into 8 different colour groups with identical functionality. In singleplayer the user controls only one group with the rest being computer controlled (or not available), while in multiplayer every player may control a different group. The objective for each level depends on the current game mode which can be one of the following: * Corral the Clone - The group which beams up (saves) the most clones wins. * Capture the Clone - Each group tries to lure a large clone to an exit area. * Procure the Particle - Each group must direct their clones to pick up a particle and then lead the particle-carrying clone to the particle receptacle. * Multiverse Match - Every group has their own sealed duplicate level and must race to complete the puzzle in the shortest time. * Quantum Quarrel - Each group tries to atomize clones of other groups. The last clone group standing wins. * Super Synergy (multiplayer only) - Co-operative multiplayer. Multiple players can solve puzzles as a team. * Quantum Loop (singleplayer only) - A level with N groups is played N times and on each iteration the player controls the Nth group and must co-ordinate the morphs given in the past with the currently controlled group. Each game mode may have a number of options to vary the gameplay such as allowing a single saboteur clone in the Multiverse Match mode. Multiplayer The multiplayer experience takes place in the setting of the intergalactic CloneMaster League. Players can host a tournament or view a list of all active tournaments in the universe and join one. Multiplayer matches offer a high degree of replay value and can be much more intense than singleplayer as a result of humans being so unpredictable. Players have the option of registering a one-on-one match with the CloneStats world ranking system which uses a chess-like method for determining a players rank. This mode is similar to Multiplayer Lemmings from the SNES version of Lemmings, but playable over the internet or LAN. Level editor Clones comes with a built-in, fully featured WYSIWYG level editor which will allow players to create their own multiplayer levels as well as CloneMaster packs to extend the number of singleplayer puzzles. The editor uses object primitives to build up a level from many small pieces. Objects can be freely rotated, scaled, tinted, and alpha-blended to produce levels with a high level of appeal. Levels can be compressed into level packs and then uploaded to the ClonesGame.com website to share with other players. Plot The single-player campaign places the player in the role of a new CloneMaster, visiting the Clones Planet who is to progress on a pilgrimage to visit and learn from 10 Elder CloneMasters. Each defeated Elder gives the player a segment of a medallion which once restored will unlock a final Elder CloneMaster. Each CloneMaster will present the player with 10-20 puzzles with the final puzzle being a head-to-head battle against the Elder in Multiverse Match mode. Players are encouraged to learn as much as possible from the Elders before engaging in online play, which can be very challenging. Development Clones was developed by Tomkorp Computer Solutions Inc.Tomkorp Computer Solutions Inc. which is a two-man company from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada that specializes in building customized multi-user database applications. Clones is their first released game. Financial support was provided by Telefilm Canada, STEM, and Fortune Cat Games Studio Incubator.Fortune Cat FundingFortune Cat Games Studio receives government support Funding Funding for the Fortune Cat Video Games incubator comes from Component IV of the Winnipeg Partnership Agreement by Western Economic Diversification Canada.

He also translated, from PƒÅli into English, a key Buddhist text, Dhammapada (1973).

After finding this spiritually misleading, he discovered an older English translation of the Bhagavad Gita. This inspired him to study Sanskrit in order to gain a better understanding of the text, as the available translation was quite poor. He studied modern and oriental languages at Cambridge University and spent some time lecturing on the Spanish Mystics. He then went to Ceylon where he was Vice-Principal of Parameshwara College at Jaffna. Later, he became Professor of English at the Autonomous University of Barcelona.

He attained a 10th Degree black belt in Shuri-ry≈´ karate in a very short period of time and at an unusually young age, and is one of the late Robert Trias' eight Chief instructors of the Shuri-ry≈´ system. He is the founder and director of the International Shuri-ry≈´ Association. He began his karate training in Phoenix, Arizona under Robert Trias. Karate began as a hobby which ultimately changed the direction of his life. During the 1960s he trained in the Phoenix dojo which became his primary focus. Local tournaments lead to national competitions and soon Bowles had established himself as one of the top competitors in the country. Bowles was a member of the first U.S. National Karate Association team that toured Europe, and in 1973 was the first competitor from the U.S. Karate Alliance Grand Nationals to win the triple crown ‚Äì first place in Kata, Kumite and Weapons. Trias personally awarded him the Trias International Award. However, karate was still relatively new in most parts of the country. Bowles was sent by Trias as an ambassador of Shuri- ry≈´ to teach and promote Shuri-ry≈´ across the country. Trias' daughter was the rightful successor to the organization upon the passing of Robert Trias. However, due to political strife within the group, Bowles splintered off and started his own organization Competitions In 1972, Bowles was a member of the first United States National Karate Association team to tour Europe. Since then he has represented the United States on seven different world tours visiting the following countries: Korea, China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Taiwan, England, Germany, Scotland, France, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Italy, Panama, and Venezuela.

In Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste (La Distinction, 1979), Pierre Bourdieu described how the powers that be define aesthetic concepts such as \\"taste\\", whereby the social class of a person tends to determine his or her cultural interests, likes, and dislikes, and how political and socio-economic, racial and sexual distinctions, based upon social class, are reinforced in daily life within society. Moreover, in The Rebel Sell: Why the Culture Can't be Jammed (2004), Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter describe \\"distinction\\" as a social competition in which the styles of social fashion are in continual development, and that the men and women who do not follow the development of social trends soon become stale, and irrelevant to their social-class stratum.  Cultural Distinction  Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, 1969. Interest in distinctions within culture is further being explored leading to new ideas. Cultural distinction is being expanded upon by the cultural capital, which are the social assets of a person, and a key element of visual display empowerment. External appearance plays a role in forms of cultural capital that may be more extrovert. Sociologist Pierre Bourdieu discussed an objectified cultural capital, where the visual aesthetic of people or objects is more important than the inner-meaning. Bourdieu argues that pictures that are not attractive become appealing because of the high levels of cultural capital. Giselinde Kuipers evaluated physical looks among four European countries. Her study found the relationship of social position and beauty for males was weakest, but for females was highest. This study reflected Bourdieu‚Äôs aesthetic disposition because Kuiper found that young and educated people are attracted to an original beauty. Kuipers research presents evidence of cultural capital being more transmissible. Such examples being younger generations having different aesthetic styles into traditional culture.  Legal Distinction  Sociologist Max Weber Distinctions of legal societies, being internal and external perspectives, play a role on the way law communities are viewed. Legal distinction‚Äôs position in society is determined by a variety of factors such as culture, ideology, politics, economics, science, education and technology. Sociologist Max Weber uses assessment of value judgments against socio-scholars. Sociology scholars, in law, are commonly viewed as fixers of law policies who give important guidance to the law makers. Weber argues that socio-scholars have to show passion for any value among society. Law and morals should be separated according to the separation thesis. This thesis is criticized by many sociologists due to systems being separated from normative systems in society. Distinction in legal and social science is shown to be different from the normative order. Roger Cotterrell argues law is made up of a communal network and the operations within are determined by intrinsic values. In Cotterrell‚Äôs argument, he concludes a dualistic view of law being symbolic and instrumental by socio-legal theory instead of legal theory to determine legal normativity.  Military Distinction  Military distinction deals with the roles of military personnel and society. Various differing roles in many countries could change the distinction military perceives to society. Task changes in the military has changed the view on society for the role that is established. Soldiers are viewed as peacekeepers and identify with this role while also being in the role of a warrior. Terrorism is another factor that plays a role on military and their perception by society. Terrorism is a major threat that military deal with and are not typically tasks of police forces. Society sees the structural position of the military to be separate from police forces. Civil-military divide influences roles of work force and military organization. The two groups interact by social, cultural, and educational differences. Roles are defined by relationships between military personnel and citizen-soldiers. Social actors, like threats to environment, cause tensions that could be brought into discussion for differing sectors of military.

In 1961, parents Mickey and Ginny Cochran built a small ski area on their hillside property along the Winooski River in rural Vermont, the Cochran's ski hill, where they trained their four children to be world-class ski racers. All four - Bob, Barbara Ann, Marilyn and Lindy - represented the U.S. in the Winter Olympics, with Barbara Ann winning the gold medal in slalom at the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. The next generation of Cochrans has continued the racing tradition, placing six family members on the U.S. Ski Team, while Cochran's Ski Area has grown into a local winter recreation area with three lifts and eight slopes attracting a loyal contingent of children and families from around Vermont. Parents *Gordon T. \\"Mickey\\" Cochran (1924‚Äì1998) \\\\- An athlete, a soldier, an engineer, and a teacher all rolled into one, Mickey's talents added up to genius on the ski slopes. He was a standout athlete in baseball and football at Chelmsford High School in Massachusetts. He pitched and played quarterback for the University of Vermont until his engineering studies were interrupted by the war. He served in the 84th Infantry Division in France and Germany in World War II. His unit was surrounded in the Battle of the Bulge. He saw significant action, including crossing the Rhine on a floating foot bridge under fire. His squad saw 300% casualties between October 1944 and the end of the war in Europe. His athletic skills helped him to survive with minor wounds. While in the army he pitched batting practice in Europe for Ted Williams. He also played semi-pro baseball in the US and the provincial leagues in Canada. He returned to the University of Vermont after the war and earned a BS in mechanical engineering and a master's degree in education. He loved skiing and applied engineering to developing his own highly successful technique, independently of what was popular. Under his tutelage - and while training on the backyard ski hill that he built himself - all four of his children became members of the U.S. Ski Team. Among his other accomplishments, Mickey was the Alpine Director of the U.S. Team during the 1973-74 ski season and coach of the University of Vermont (UVM) Ski Team throughout the 1970s. With Mickey as alpine coach the UVM Ski Team won their first major winter carnivals, including Dartmouth in 1973, Middlebury and Williams, and began the longest regular season undefeated streak in NCAA history. Mickey died in March 1998 of congestive heart failure at the age of 74. The athletes he coached at UVM noted that he was all the man there is, and one of the greatest ski coaches ever.

It is a fictional account of the invention of the striptease at Minsky's Burlesque in 1925. The film is based on the novel by Rowland Barber, published in 1960. Plot Rachel Schpitendavel (Britt Ekland), an innocent Amish girl from rural Pennsylvania, arrives in New York's Lower East Side hoping to make it as a dancer. Rachel's dances are based on Bible stories. She auditions at Minsky's Burlesque, but her dances are much too dull and chaste for the bawdy show. But then Billy Minsky (Elliott Gould) and the show's jaded straight man, Raymond Paine (Jason Robards), concoct a plan to foil moral crusader Vance Fowler (Denholm Elliott), who is intent on shutting down the theater. Minsky publicizes Rachel as the notorious Madamoiselle Fifi, performing the \\"dance that drove a million Frenchmen wild.\\" This will invite a raid by Fowler and the police. But Billy will let Rachel perform her innocuous Bible dances, thus humiliating Fowler. During the run-up to her midnight performance, Raymond and his partner, Chick (Norman Wisdom), show Rachel the ropes of burlesque, and they both fall for her in the process. Meanwhile, Rachel's stern father (Harry Andrews), who even objects to her Bible dances, arrives in search of his daughter. The film climaxes when Rachel takes the stage after her father has called her a whore and she realizes that the Minskys are just using her. Her father tries to drag her off-stage, but she pulls away and accidentally tears a slit in her dress. The sold-out crowd spurs her on and Rachel begins to enjoy her power over the audience and starts to strip. She looks into the wings and sees Raymond, who senses a raid and perhaps the end of an era, leaving the theater for good. Rachel calls and throws out her arms to him, inadvertently dropping the front of her dress and baring her breasts. Fowler blows his whistle and the police rush the stage and close down the show. A madcap melee follows. In the end, most of the cast members are loaded into a paddy wagon, including Rachel's bewildered father. Cast * Jason Robards as Raymond Paine * Britt Ekland as Rachel Elizabeth Schpitendavel * Norman Wisdom as Chick Williams * Forrest Tucker as Trim Houlihan * Harry Andrews as Jacob Schpitendavel * Joseph Wiseman as Louis Minsky * Denholm Elliott as Vance Fowler * Elliott Gould as Billy Minsky * Jack Burns as Candy Butcher * Bert Lahr as Professor Spats Production=Background In his book Minsky's Burlesque, Morton Minsky (with Milt Machlin) wrote, \\"As for April 20, 1925, the day that the raid on which the book was based took place, it was hardly epochal in the history of burlesque, but it did turn out to be a prelude to much greater troubles... Anyway, the raid story was fun, but the raid itself was simply one of dozens to which we had become accustomed; certainly no big crisis.\\" Minsky's theater, the National Winter Garden on Houston Street, was raided for the first time in 1917 when Mae Dix absentmindedly began removing her costume before she reached the wings. When the crowd cheered, Dix returned to the stage and continued removing her clothing to wild applause. Billy Minsky ordered the \\"accident\\" repeated every night. This began an endless cycle; to keep their license, the Minskys had to keep their shows clean, but to keep drawing customers, they had to be risqu√©. Whenever they went too far, however, they were raided. According to Morton Minsky, Mademoiselle Fifi was actually a woman named Mary Dawson, from Pennsylvania. Morton suggests that his brother, Billy, persuaded Dawson to expose her breasts in order to create a sensation. By 1925, it was permissible for girls in legitimate shows staged by Ziegfeld, George White and Earl Carroll‚Äîas well as burlesque‚Äîto appear topless as long as they didn't move (as a \\"living tableau\\"). Mademoiselle Fifi stripped to the waist, but then moved, triggering the raid. \\"Although the show in general had been tame,\\" he wrote, \\"Fifi's finale and the publicity that soon followed the raid ensured full houses at the soon-to-be opened [Minsky's] theater uptown [on 42nd Street].\\" (The Minskys did not stage burlesque on 42nd Street until 1931, when they leased the Republic Theater. They had a short-lived venture at the Park Theater on Columbus Circle in 1922, but left the theater after only a year. They leased the Apollo Theater on 125th Street from 1924 until 1933, after which it became famous as a showcase for African-American talent.) In 1975, Dawson, then 85, refuted the legend. \\"I was never a stripteaser. I never did anything risque\\". She said that novelist Rowland Barber \\"just put all that in the book to make it better.\\" She wasn't even at the theater that night. Her father was a policeman and a straitlaced Quaker, although he never came to New York City and never led a raid on one of the Minsky burlesque houses.The Utica Daily Press, December 30, 1975 Pre-production In April 1961, producer Leonard Key outbid several others for the stage rights to Rowland Barber's book. (Debbie Reynolds reportedly had sought the film rights in 1961.) At that time it was reported to be the highest price ever paid for such rights, and that the novel would be adapted by screenwriter Edward Chodorov.Dorothy Kilgallen's column, Niagara Falls Gazette, April 21, 1961 Later in the year, however, Key had enlisted screenwriter Julius J. Epstein.\\"From Minsky's to Broadway,\\" Utica Daily Press, October 23, 1961 At these early stages, Sammy Cahn as well as Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini were rumored to do the music. The show never found financial backing before the option for the stage rights ran out two years later in 1963.Dorothy Kilgallen's column, Schenectady Gazette, May 23, 1963 Norman Lear and Bud Yorkin bought the film rights in September 1965. Lear originally announced that production would start in the fall of 1966. Dick Shawn was reportedly being considered for the \\"lead role\\" (unspecified) in July 1966.Jack O'Brian's column, Schenectady Gazette, July 14, 1966 However, filming didn't begin until a year later, on October 8, 1967. On May 23, 1967, the Los Angeles Times reported that William Friedkin was set to direct. Friedkin's first film, Good Times (1967), starring Sonny and Cher, had just been released. A musical comedy which spoofs various movie genres, including mysteries, westerns and spy thrillers, it was a critical and box- office flop. He was quoted as saying that 'The Night They Raided Minskys will be \\"poetic reality.\\"Quoted in Jack O'Brian's column, Tonawanda News, October 17, 1967 Tony Curtis was cast as Raymond Paine in June 1967, but dropped out a month later because of creative differences. Alan Alda, whose father, Robert Alda, had been in burlesque, was cast as Paine, but was unable to leave his role on Broadway in The Apple Tree.Buffalo Courier-Express, October 8, 1967 Jason Robards took over the Paine role about a month before filming began. (Raymond Paine was the name of a real straight man who was in the show that night. He was killed in a hit and run accident in 1934.) Elliott Gould, who was then married to Barbra Streisand, was signed in August 1967 and made his film debut as Billy Minsky. Mickey Rooney was said to be considered for the Chick Williams role,Harrison Carroll's column, New York and Brooklyn Daily, August 24, 1967 but Joel Grey, then on Broadway in Cabaret, was initially cast. Grey had to drop out, however, because the film had no firm end date and Grey was committed to start rehearsals for George M!, a musical about George M. Cohan, in mid-December.Dorothy Manners column, September 22, 1967 British comedian Norman Wisdom, who had recently been nominated for a Tony Award for his acclaimed performance in the James Van Heusen-Sammy Cahn musical comedy Walking Happy, was cast. Wisdom had made a series of low-budget star-vehicle comedies for the Rank Organisation. Never highly regarded by critics, Wisdom's films had enjoyed good box-office returns in his native country. The Night They Raided Minsky's was his first American film, and he received good notices. A contributor to Variety wrote: \\"So easily does Wisdom dominate his many scenes, other cast members suffer by comparison\\", and Time compared him to Buster Keaton. The songs were written by the Broadway team of composer Charles Strouse and lyricist Lee Adams, who had won a Tony Award for the musical Bye Bye Birdie in 1961, and went on to win Tonys for Applause (1970) and Annie (1977, with lyricist Martin Charnin). Strouse also wrote the theme song \\"Those Were The Days\\" for Lear's sitcom All in the Family. The score was orchestrated and conducted by Broadway veteran Philip J. Lang, working on his only film made for theatrical release. Production The Night They Raided Minsky's was the first musical shot entirely on location in New York City. The budget exceeded $3 million, making it the most expensive film shot in the city up to that time. A block of East 26th Street between First and Second Avenues was transformed into the Lower East Side 1925. (The vacant tenements on the block were scheduled to be torn down as part of an urban renewal project, but the city postponed demolition for the filmmakers.) A portion of an elevated train station 30 feet tall and 56 feet long was built. The scene in a subway car was filmed on the Myrtle Avenue elevated in Brooklyn. Parking meters were disguised by garbage cans and barrels. Exteriors were shot there for two weeks. Some interiors were filmed at Chelsea Studios.New York: The Movie Lover's Guide: The Ultimate Insider Tour of Movie New York - Richard Alleman - Broadway (February 1, 2005) The theater sequences were filmed at what was then the Gayety Theater (now the Village East Cinema), at 181 Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. Minsky's was Bert Lahr's last film. The 72-year-old comedian, best known for his role as the Cowardly Lion in The Wizard of Oz, was a veteran of the Columbia burlesque wheel. He was hospitalized on November 21 for what was reported as a back ailment. In Notes on a Cowardly Lion: The Biography of Bert Lahr, John Lahr wrote: \\"Bert Lahr died in the early morning of December 4, 1967. Two weeks before, he had returned home at 2 a.m., chilled and feverish, from the damp studio where The Night They Raided Minsky's was being filmed. Ordinarily, a man of his age and reputation would not have had to perform that late into the night, but he had waived that proviso in his contract because of his trust in the producer and his need to work. The newspapers reported the cause of death as pneumonia; but he succumbed to cancer, a disease he feared but never knew he had.\\" Most of Lahr's scenes had already been shot. Norman Lear told The New York Times that \\"through judicious editing we will be able to shoot the rest of the film so that his wonderful performance will remain intact.\\" The producers used test footage of Lahr, plus an uncredited voice double and a body double, burlesque legend Joey Faye, to complete the late comedian's role. Filming was scheduled to wrap on December 22, 1967. The movie was released exactly a year later, on December 22, 1968. Post-production Film editor Ralph Rosenblum documented his experience working on The Night They Raided Minsky's in his 1979 book (written with Robert Karen), When the Shooting Stops ...The Cutting Begins. Rosenblum wrote: \\"I had taken Minsky's on not because I believed it would be a great editorial challenge but because I saw it as a lark. I had just come off six months on The Producers, a trying experience that pickled my nerve endings, and I badly needed a soothing job...The script revealed a frothy, unimportant film full of musical numbers, the kind of thing that might be snapped into shape in six to eight weeks of editing. I loved cutting musicals; I expected a short stretch of mindless fun.\\" In the end, it took him over nine months to cut the film. He wrote: \\"From the very beginning, the idea behind The Night They Raided Minsky's had been to create an 'old-fashioned musical with a New Look'...although what it was and how it was going to be accomplished no one knew...Had anyone dared to acknowledge that the New Look we hoped to achieve in Minsky's was essentially a [Richard] Lester look, we all might have been saved some anguish; but such an acknowledgement would have been considered inappropriate, if not blasphemous, and so it barely crossed our minds.\\" Rosenblum called the screening of his first cut with Friedkin and Lear \\"disastrous.\\" \\"The chief drawback of Minsky's dramatic episodes was their predictability,\\" Rosenblum wrote. \\"The script had aimed for an old-fashioned charm, but, with a few important exceptions, no new twist of sophistication was added to please a modern audience.\\" When the cut was screened for David Picker, an executive VP of United Artists, he called it \\"the worst first cut I've ever seen.\\" However, since there was no set release date for the film, Picker told Lear and Rosenblum, \\"Whatever you want to do, go ahead, take your time, and do it.\\" Drawing on his background editing documentaries, Rosenblum turned to the huge stock film libraries in New York and began selecting clips from the 1920s. By arduous trial and error, this footage was used not only to evoke a sense of time and place, but also to comment on and enhance scenes in the film. Rosenblum created montages of this material and Friedkin's footage, often marrying vintage footage with new by transitioning from black and white into color. The effect, Rosenblum wrote, was \\"magical.\\" While Rosenblum worked over the cut throughout most of 1968, Lear was developing other projects, including one that would become the TV series All in the Family; Friedkin, meanwhile, was in England, directing the film adaptation of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party. Not long after he saw the first cut of Minsky's, Friedkin was interviewed on British television, and called Minsky's \\"the biggest piece of crap I'd ever worked on.\\" According to Rosenblum, \\"I'd heard that [Friedkin] would be barred from screenings [of Minsky's] because of his talk show blunder and would have to pay to get in.\\" Eventually, The Night They Raided Minsky's was remade in the cutting room. \\"Above all, this emerging Minsky's was highly contemporary,\\" Rosenblum wrote. \\"One might even conclude it had a New Look. The obvious fact that had eluded us from the beginning suddenly struck me now: The avant-garde quality Richard Lester had achieved in films like Help! could only be accomplished through editing. From the moment the Search for the New Look began, Minsky's was destined to be a cutting-room picture.\\" Rosenblum claimed that there are 1,440 cuts in the film; by comparison, Annie Hall, a film of the same length, has only 382. Of course, most of the credit went to Friedkin, who, according to Rosenblum, \\"may not have even seen the film.\\" Friedkin later admitted to having \\"no vision\\" for Minsky's and instead borrowed from Rouben Mamoulian's film Applause (1929), an early talkie about burlesque notable for its innovative camera work. In 2008, Friedkin recalled, \\"Minsky's was way over my head. I didn't have a clue what to do. Norman produced it and he was a very difficult, tough guy to work with, but I learned a great deal from him and I was struggling every day on the set. It wasn't a great script...it was a lot of schtick. But it would've been a lot better if I'd been more familiar with that world of burlesque in the 20s, which I wasn't. So because of that I think the film suffers to a great degree from that.\\" In an online interview in 2012, Friedkin said, \\"I have few, if any positive, memories of it. But when I made the DVD recently, having not seen the film for 40 years, I thought it had some pleasant and amusing moments.\\" In his 2013 memoir, The Friedkin Connection, the director wrote: \\"There were many problems with it, but the biggest was my own ineptitude. I had researched the period but I didn't know how to convey the right tone.\\" At one point he asked Norman Lear to fire him. Title Sequence The main title sequence was designed by Pablo Ferrohttps://deadline.com/2018/11/pablo-ferro-dead-title- designer-a-clockwork-orange-dr-strangelove-1202504484/ (1935‚Äì2018), who was also an uncredited editor on the film. Reception The film opened in Los Angeles on December 18, 1968 before rolling out throughout the United States in December. The film received good reviews for its tribute to old time burlesque. Roger Ebert wrote in the Chicago Sun-Times, \\"The Night They Raided Minsky's is being promoted as some sort of laff-a-minit, slapstick extravaganza, but it isn't. It has the courage to try for more than that and just about succeeds. It avoids the phony glamour and romanticism that the movies usually use to smother burlesque (as in Gypsy) and it really seems to understand this most-American art form.\\" The New York Times critic Renata Adler wrote, \\"The nicest thing about the movie, which is a little broad in plot and long in spots, is its denseness and care in detail: The little ugly cough that comes from one room of a shoddy hotel; the thoughtfully worked out, poorly danced vaudeville routines; the beautifully timed, and genuinely funny, gags. 'I hear the man say impossible,' a man on the stage says when the man here hasn't said a word. And the vaudeville [sic] routines of innocence forever victimized, for an audience of fall guys, works pretty much as it must have worked in its time.\\" (December 23, 1968) Judith Crist, in New York magazine, wrote \\"...what a delight to have a chance to laugh out loud at sex! Like the burlesque it glorifies ‚Äì and with tender loving care ‚Äì this boisterous, colorful, wiggling eulogy to the Lower East Side bump-and-grind culture of the 1920s is plotless, frenetic, funny and just as good as the real thing. It's nostalgic as all get out to see the lumpy dumpy chorus, the snorers and the leerers and the lechers around the runway, the Crazy House bit and the spielers and, beyond the theater, the East Side in its glory from the barrels of half-sours to the knishes to the Murphy-bedded hotel rooms. Director William Friedkin (this was his pre-The Birthday Party film) proves his sense of cinema again by remarkable intersplicing of newsreels and striking use of black-and-white fade-ins to color.\\" [Friedkin, according to Ralph Rosenblum, had nothing to do with those effects.] Crist also praised the \\"off-beat\\" casting and summed up that the film was \\"really just what we were wishing for for Christmas.\\"New York Magazine, December 23, 1968. Time magazine called the film \\"a valedictory valentine to oldtime burlesque. In legend, the girls were glamorous, and every baggy-pants buffoon was a second W. C. Fields. In truth, the institution was as coarse as its audiences. Minsky's mixes both fact and fancy in a surprisingly successful musical ...Minsky's was 58 days in the shooting and ten months in the editing‚Äîand shows it. Marred by grainy film and fleshed out with documentary and pseudo-newsreel footage of the 1920s, the film spends too much time on pickles, pushcarts and passersby. But it compensates with a fond, nostalgic score, a bumping, grinding chorus line and a series of closeups of the late Bert Lahr, who plays a retired burlesque comedian. Like Lahr, the film offers an engaging blend of mockery and melancholy.\\" The film did better than expected at the box office, improving its grosses in its second week and outgrossing United Artists' Candy in New York, despite the latter film's more well-known cast, grossing $198,152 in its first 23 days from 2 theatres in the city. According to an interview in the Manchester Evening News (published October 22, 2007), The Night They Raided Minsky's is Britt Ekland's favorite film. Ekland divorced Peter Sellers four days before the film was released. Walter Winchell reported that the divorce stemmed from Sellers' displeasure that she had appeared nude in the film.Walter Winchell column, November 21, 1968. Ekland was quoted, \\"I loved William Friedkin who directed me in the film The Night They Raided Minky's because he was very specific and honest and young. He got the performance out of me which he knew I had in me.\\" Stage adaptation A stage adaptation as a musical, titled Minsky's, opened officially on February 6, 2009, at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles, and ran through March 1, 2009. The new musical was directed and choreographed by Casey Nicholaw, with a book by Bob Martin and music and lyrics by Charles Strouse and Susan Birkenhead. Though the show's program notes that it is based on the film, the book is essentially a new story.Jones, Kenneth. \\"Fitzgerald, Leavel, Wendt, Dratch Star in Premiere of Minsky's Musical in L.A.\\" , playbill.com, January 21, 2009\\"Minsky's\\" production information from the Ahmanson Theatre, see \\"Minsky's Program\\", p. 6, 01/22/09 (PDF) centertheatregroup.org Home media  The film was released on DVD on May 20, 2008, in wide-screen and full-screen versions.

He is regarded as one of the most influential Albanian writers of the 20th century for his epic masterpiece Lahuta e Malc√≠s and the editor of two of the most autoritative magazines after Albania's independence, Posta e Shypni√´s (1916‚Äì1917) and founder of Hylli i Drit√´s (1913-). Notably being the chairman of the commission of the Congress of Monastir, which sanctioned the Albanian alphabet. He was part of the Albanian delegation to the Versailles Conference, 1919. In 1921 he was a member and became the deputy chairman of the Albanian parliament, later on in the '20s and the '30s he was among the most influential cultural and literary figures in Albania. After the communist regime came to power, his literary oeuvre has been taken out of circulation, and it stayed so until the fall of communism.  Biography = Early life  Gjergj Fishta was born in Fisht√´, of the Zadrima region, then Ottoman Empire, to Ndoka and Prenda Ka√ßi. \\"Georgius (P) Josephus Fishta, f. Antonii et Venerandae Ka√ßi, n.

The parish priest of Troshan, parish where Fishta was included, Marian Pizzochini of Palmanova, asked his parents to make him a friar. At the expense of the parishioner, Zef went to the Franciscan school in Shkodra until 1880, when Troshan's College began its activity. He studied philosophy and Catholic theology in Bosnia (seminaries in Kraljeva Sutjeska, Franciscan monastery in Livno, Franciscan monastery in Kre≈°evo), among Bosnian Croats.Pater Gjergj Fishta (1871‚Äì1940) In 1902, he became the head of the Franciscan college in Shkod√´r. Fishta was under influence of Croatian Franciscan friars as a student in monasteries in Austria-Hungary, when he wrote his main work Lahuta e Malc√≠s, influenced by the national epics of the Croatian and Serbian literature according to Robert Elsie. Dedicated to the commander Ali Pasha of Gusinje the work was an epic poem that consisted of 30 cantos focusing on the events of the League of Prizren, which had become a symbol of the Albanian national awakening. He interpreted Albania in the conference of Paris on 1919. From the beginning of April 1919 to 1920, he served as Secretary of the Albanian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference. At the end of 1920, he was elected to parliament by Shkod√´r, and in 1921 he became the Vice President of the Albanian parliament. In 1924, Fishta supported Fan Noli in his attempt to found a democratic system in Albania. After the establishment of the Zogu regime, Fishta left willingly to go into exile in Italy in 1925/26, before he resumed his position as teacher and writer in Shkod√´r, where he died in 1940.  Literary works  Architectural drawings created by Gjergj Fishta. In 1899, Fishta, along with Preng Do√ßi and Ndre Mjeda founded the Shoqnia e bashkimit t√´ gjuh√´s shqipe (Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language) literary society, usually known as the Shoqnia Bashkimi (The Union Society), or simply Bashkimi (The Union) of Shkodra for publishing Albanian language books. In the late Ottoman period Fishta's publications included folk songs and a number of poems, which like other Albanian publications of the time often had to be published abroad and smuggled into the empire to avoid censorship. In 1907, Fishta wrote the satirical work The Wasps of Parnasus that critiqued Albanians of the time that placed individual interests over national ones and the intelligentsia who did not devote themselves to studying the Albanian language and showed disdain toward it. As a representative of the Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language, Fishta participated and was elected for president of the committee in the Congress of Monastir (today Bitola in North Macedonia, then Ottoman Empire) held in 1908. Participants of the congress accepted Fishta's proposal for the Latin Bashkimi alphabet, and many of its elements were merged into the Istanbul alphabet resulting in the standard Albanian alphabet. In 1916, he was core founder of the Albanian Literary Commission, where he unsuccessfully tried to place Shkodra subdialect as standard literary Albanian. Through both his work as a teacher as well as through his literary works, Fishta had a great influence on the development of the written form of his native Gheg Albanian. Fishta worked also as a translator (of Moli√®re, Manzoni, Homer, et al.).  Critic  Robert Elsie hypothesized that in Lahuta e Malc√≠s, Fishta substituted the struggle against the Ottomans with a struggle against the Slavs, after the recent massacres and expulsions of Albanians by their Slavic neighbours. After the World War II the authorities in Yugoslavia and Albanian historiography controlled by communist regime in Tirana (influenced by Yugoslav communists) proscribed Fishta's works as anti-Slavic propaganda. According to Arshi Pipa, Fishta's satirical works are modulated after the Bejte tradition of Shkod√´r, which he elevated to a literary level.  Legacy = Awards in his lifetime  He was awarded with the Order of Franz Joseph from Austro-Hungarian Empire authorities, later on in 1925 with the Medaglia di Benemerenza by the Holy See. On 1931 by the Order of the Phoenix by Greece, and after the Italian invasion of Albania he was part of the Royal Academy of Italy.  Historical  In Soviet historiography he was referred to as \\"former agent of Austro-Hungarian imperialism\\" who took position against Slavic people and Pan-Slavism because they opposed \\"rapacious plans of Austro- Hungarian imperialism in Albania\\" and had a role in Catholic Clergy's preparation \\"for Italian aggression against Albania\\".

It was written by Lee Eisenberg and Gene Stupnitsky and directed by Dennie Gordon. The episode first aired on January 19, 2006 on NBC. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In this episode, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is forced into spending time with Michael Scott (Steve Carell) so that Michael will not reveal Jim's feelings for Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer). Meanwhile, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) takes a \\"sick day\\" and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) investigates whether he is actually sick. \\"The Secret\\" was written in roughly 26 hours and was the fastest episode written for the series at the time. The title for the episode is purposely vague and refers to Jim's hidden feelings for Pam, Dwight and Angela's relationship, and Oscar's homosexuality. \\"The Secret\\" is also the first episode where many of the actors not credited in the opening sequence are credited directly afterwards instead of as guest appearances. The scenes at the Hooters restaurant were filmed relatively early in the day, and a majority of the scenes were improvised by Carell. \\"The Secret\\" received largely positive reviews from television critics and was watched by 8.7 million viewers, ranking as the forty-fourth most-watched television episode of the week. Plot Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) realizes that Michael Scott (Steve Carell) mistakenly assumed he was making his feelings for Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) known to everyone. He tells Michael that he meant this to be a secret between the two of them. Michael concludes from this that he and Jim are friends, which leads to an awkward lunch at Hooters paid for with a corporate credit card. Michael ultimately reveals Jim's secret to everyone, forcing Jim to confess his crush to Pam himself, although he tells her that he got over it three years ago. However, Michael later tells her that he learned of the crush during the recent \\"booze cruise\\", leading her to suspect Jim is still infatuated. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) \\"investigates\\" Oscar Martinez's (Oscar Nunez) claimed sick day from work, learning that the co- worker is actually taking time off to ice-skate. Dwight blackmails Oscar, saying he owes him a favor in return for not revealing his unauthorized leave- taking. He then watches a movie with Oscar and Oscar's \\"roommate\\" Gil (Tom W. Chick).

The idea to make the entry the \\"spring cleaning episode\\" was \\"throw[n] in at the last minute\\" because the writers were \\"desperate\\". The subplot was inspired by a friend of Eisenberg's, who suggested the story after he was forced to undergo spring cleaning at his office. The title for the episode is purposely vague. During the commentary, the cast revealed that there are actually three \\"secrets\\" in the episode: Jim's hidden feelings for Pam, Dwight and Angela's relationship, and Oscar's homosexuality. Stupkitsky later joked that there are \\"actually nine secrets in the episode\\". The cold opening ‚Äì wherein Michael tries to tell a joke where the punch line is \\"What's up dog?\\" ‚Äì was inspired by the same prank being pulled on Stupnitsky. The original cold opening for the episode featured Michael playing golf in his office, but it was cut. Jenna Fischer felt that Krasinski's performance in the episode was \\"really great\\" and called \\"The Secret\\" her \\"favorite John Krasinski episode\\". Krasinski said that Creed Bratton's line, \\"Which one is Pam?\\" was his favorite moment \\"in the entire show, ever\\".Krasinski, John (Actor). 2006. \\"The Secret\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Fischer, in turn, said that her favorite moment was when Jim confesses that he does not have a crush on her, due to the emotion involved. Fischer later admitted that, after the shot was filmed, she cried because it \\"broke [her] heart\\". Filming The episode guest starred Tom W. Chick as Gil. \\"The Secret\\" was directed by Dennie Gordon, who would go on to direct the season two episode \\"Boys and Girls\\".Baumgartner, Brian (Actor). 2006. \\"The Secret\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal.Fischer, Jenna (Actor). 2006. \\"The Secret\\" [Commentary track], The Office Season Two (US/NBC Version) [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Universal. Tom W. Chick portrayed Gil. The cast were particularly impressed with his acting; Fischer called him a \\"great casting\\" choice.

The shots at the Hooters restaurant were filmed relatively early in the day, and a majority of the scenes were improvised by Carell. In fact, Carell decided to play the penis game ‚Äì in which two or more people shout the word \\"penis\\" at varying levels in an attempt to out do each other ‚Äì which Krasinski called \\"the craziest thing I have experienced.\\" The scene where Pam and Kelly discuss wedding plans was particularly difficult to shoot all in one scene, due to the amount of activity going on. John Krasinski later noted that he was impressed that the director and cameramen were able to successfully get the shot. The sequence featuring Michael and Jim talking in the break room was made of two composition shots, because Krasinski was laughing \\"the entire\\" time. Michael buying Stanley a peach ice tea and telling him that he will \\"hate it\\" was entirely improvised. Deleted scenes The Season Two DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include the cut cold opening of Michael playing with his new putting toy, Dwight expounding on his thoughts on dust bunnies, Michael surveying his \\"worker bees\\", Ryan Howard (B.J. Novak) finding an unfinished People Magazine crossword puzzle from 1999 in Michael's office, Michael describing his college fraternity experience, and Michael buying Jim a Hooters T-shirt. Cultural references Michael attributes the 1981 song \\"Our Lips Are Sealed\\" to The Bangles, when it was really sung by The Go-Go's. Michael and Jim go to Hooters, a company whose waiting staff are primarily young, attractive waitresses usually referred to simply as \\"Hooter Girls\\" whose revealing outfits and sex appeal is played up and is a primary component of the company's image. At the restaurant, Michael makes several breast jokes. Near the end of the episode, Michael makes reference to a nonexistent Cinemax movie called More Secrets of a Call Girl. Reception \\"The Secret\\" originally aired on NBC on January 19, 2006. The episode was watched by 8.7 million viewers. This marked a slight decrease in viewers from a lead-in episode of \\"My Name is Earl\\", but more than a follow-up episode of \\"ER\\". \\"The Secret\\" ranked as the forty-fourth most-watched episode for the week ending January 22.

What began as a two-lane highway has been upgraded to a four-lane freeway along its northern stretches from US Hwy 90 on the West to Kitty Hawk Rd on the East. The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) is planning to further upgrade this freeway segment from 4 general purpose lanes to 8 general purpose lanes and 2 HOV lanes from Bandera Rd to I-35. Loop 1604 is named for former Bexar County Judge Charles W. Anderson, who died from cancer in 1964 after serving for 25 years on the bench. History Loop 1604 was designated on June 30, 1977 after FM 1604 was combined with a large portion of FM 1518 to complete a larger loop around San Antonio. Three bypasses were completed in the early 1980s: on December 12, 1979, FM 1937 was extended to replace a bypassed portion near Losoya; on March 3, 1981, FM 327 was designated as the through route when Loop 1604 was rerouted around Elmendorf; and in 1983 Loop 1604 was routed around Lone Oak, creating FM 3465 over the previous routing. Route description Loop 1604 forms a complete loop around the city of San Antonio and is the outer of two loops around the city with I-410 being the inner loop. The route has portions that are built to freeway standards, portions built as a divided highway, and portions that are just a two-lane rural road. As with I-410, the city's inner loop, the northern half is more urbanized and the southern half, for the most part, remains rural. The loop officially begins and ends at I-10 east of San Antonio. It heads south from I-10 as a two-lane road and turns towards the southeast and intersects FM 1346, FM 1518, and FM 3465 while turning back towards the south and reaching a junction with US 87 in Lone Oak. Continuing to the south, Loop 1604 has a second intersection with FM 3465, an intersection with FM 3432 as the road turns towards the southwest and a junction with US 181 near Calaveras Lake. Heading southwest from US 181, the highway intersects FM 327 as it enters the city of Elmendorf. It intersects FM 327 once again as it leaves Elmendorf heading towards the southwest. At FM 1303, Loop 1604 turns towards the west before a junction with I-37. Continuing west through the southern portions of Bexar County, the loop intersects FM 1937 (South Flores Road) and FM 3499 before an interchange with US 281. The highway continues to the west to an interchange with SH 16, passing to the south of the Toyota Motor Manufacturing Texas plant. The highway continues to the west and begins to curve towards the north as it enters the city limits of Somerset and an intersection with FM 2790 (Somerset Road). Completing the turn to the north as it leaves Somerset, Loop 1604 heads north to an interchange with I-35. The highway heads north after the I-35 interchange to an intersection with FM 2536 (Old Pearsall Road) before an interchange with US 90. North of US 90, Loop 1604 becomes a four-lane divided highway with median crossings only located at traffic lights and turnarounds at those traffic lights to facilitate traffic flow of vehicles turning around to go in the opposite direction. The highway enters the San Antonio city limits near Marbach Road and follows near the city limit. Major intersections along this stretch include Marbach Road, FM 1957 (Potranco Road) and Wiseman Boulevard. The loop continues north near the campus of Northwest Vista College to a junction with the western terminus of SH 151\\\\. The intersection is signalized but southbound traffic is not required to stop due to no left hand turns from SH 151 to Loop 1604\\\\. Westbound traffic from SH 151 are either routed to the northbound main lanes of Loop 1604 or the northbound frontage road of Loop 1604. In 2016, TxDOT unveiled plans to upgrade the section from US 90 to SH 151 to a freeway starting in late 2016, and Google Earth satellite imagery showed this freeway under construction in 2017-2018. The freeway portion starts as the loop curves towards the northeast at the junction with SH 151\\\\. Loop 1604 has diamond interchanges at FM 471 (Culebra Road), Shaenfield Road, New Guilbeau Road, Braun Road, and SH 16 (Bandera Road). The freeway continues to the northeast with interchanges at FM 1560 (Hausman Road) and Babcock Road. The freeway begins to head east at the Babcock Road interchange and passes near the UTSA main campus, the Shops at La Cantera and Six Flags Fiesta Texas. The freeway continues to the east to a cloverleaf interchange with I-10. East of I-10, the freeway has interchanges with Lockhill-Selma Road, FM 1535 (Military Highway), Bitters Road and Huebner Road. As it passes through the north side of San Antonio, the freeway has interchanges with FM 2696 (Blanco Road) and Stone Oak Parkway before reaching US 281, which connect by way of an interchange completed in December 2012. Continuing east from the US 281 interchange, the freeway has interchanges with several local roads to include Gold Canyon Drive, Redland Road, Bulverde Road, and O'Connor Road. The freeway continues east to interchanges with Judson Road and Green Mountain Road before it curves to head to the southeast. Now heading southeast, the freeway has an interchange at FM 2252 near Rolling Oaks Mall and an interchange at Lookout Road before it leaves the San Antonio city limits. Upon leaving San Antonio, the freeway enters the Live Oak city limits before a cloverleaf interchange at I-35. Southeast of I-35, Loop 1604 enters the Universal City city limits before reaching an interchange with SH 218, which provides access to Randolph Air Force Base. Between the interchange at SH 218 and Kitty Hawk Road, Loop 1604 has a couple at-grade turn-offs at Palisades Drive and Granada Drive. At-grade turn-offs southeast of the Kitty Hawk Road interchange are located at Meadowland Drive and Byrd Boulevard. The last two interchanges of the freeway are located at FM 1976 and FM 78\\\\. The highway merges down to a two-lane road as it enters the Converse city limits. The highway passes by the western boundary of Randolph Air Force Base before curving to the south. The highway re-enters San Antonio city limits prior to its interchange at I-10 at its official beginning and end. Expansion Construction recently finished to expand the freeway section of Loop 1604 from SH 16 (Bandera Road) to FM 471 (Culebra Road). New overpasses were built at Shaenfield Road, New Guilbeau Road and Braun Road. TxDOT has expanded the project further south to SH 151 and US-90, creating a direct flyover overpass from southbound Loop 1604 to eastbound US-90. The expansion has proven to be necessarily due to the soaring growth at the San Antonio‚Äôs far west side. Junction list Clockwise reads down and counterclockwise reads up.

Canon McGarry was killed in a car accident in 1977.The Furrow as window on Irish Church By Michael J. Farrell, National Catholic Reporter. The current editor is the Reverend Dr P√°draig Corkery, Department of Moral Theology, Pontifical University, Maynooth. McGarry set out his editorial and pastoral ambitions for the journal in the first edition: \\"The Furrow is something new. It is new in the ground it opens. Many branches of pastoral work to which our times have given a special importance demand a fuller treatment ‚Äî preaching, pastoral organisations, the liturgy, the Church, its art and architecture. And it is in such matters especially that theory needs to be confirmed and corrected by practice. The pooling of experiences in varying conditions of work and the exchange of views on new pastoral methods are means hitherto little used, yet they can give valuable help to all who are charged by God to keep His field. A new opportunity is offered in The Furrow for the sharing of such experience. Moreover, recent years have given evidence of an increasing interest in writing on the part of our younger priests. Life in the priesthood and Christian culture offer to such young writers rich and fertile themes, opening to them a new way of serving the Church, its faith and civilisation. The Furrow will consider it a point of duty to support and encourage such writers.\\"Rev James McGarry, ‚ÄòForeword‚Äô, The Furrow, February 1952, vol. 1, no. 1, p. 5.

Well before completing his university studies at Leiden, he had already become well-established internationally as a radio astronomer in the Netherlands, specializing in studies of radio sources and the Milky Way Galaxy based on observations of radio continuum emissions and 21-cm spectral line radiation that originates in interstellar hydrogen. He emigrated to the United States, became a naturalized citizen, and held a number of important scientific and management positions in academic and government institutions. Career Westerhout was born in The Hague, and studied at the University of Leiden (Sterrewacht te Leiden) with Hendrik van de Hulst and Jan Hendrik Oort. Contemporaries and colleagues in the Netherlands included Hugo van Woerden, C. Lex Muller, Maarten Schmidt, Kwee Kiem King, Lodewijk Woltjer, and Charles L. Seeger, III (son of the ethnomusicologist, brother of Pete Seeger and half- brother of Mike Seeger). While they were students, Wim Brouw, Mike Davis, Ernst Raimond, Whitney Shane and worked with him. He was awarded Physics and Astronomy degrees: Cand. (1950) and Drs. (1954) and was awarded a Ph.D. in Astronomy and Physics in 1958. Notable scientific achievements included: the significant Westerhout Catalog of continuum emission radio sources, by which \\"W\\" numerical designations such sources are still referenced (see for example Westerhout 49), done with the then-new Dwingeloo telescope; and his survey of neutral hydrogen in the outer parts of our Galaxy. His pioneering work, with colleagues, showed the first hints of spiral structure in the interstellar gas, revealed differential rotation in our Galaxy, and established a revised Galactic coordinate system still in use today. While still at Leiden University, he held the posts of Assistant (1952‚Äì56), Scientific Officer (1956‚Äì59, and Chief Scientific Officer (1959‚Äì62). Arriving in 1962 as the first Director of a fledgling Astronomy Program at the University of Maryland (started by Uco van Wijk), he grew it into a major department granting masters and doctorate degrees. On the research side the Line Survey, Maryland-Green Bank Galactic 21-cm undertaken with the 91-m radio telescope of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, not only extended to higher angular resolution our knowledge of Galactic structure, but also accomplished the training of graduate students who went on to notable achievements of their own. He continued at Maryland in that role through 1973, with additional responsibilities from 1972-73 as Chairman of the Division of Mathematical & Physical Sciences and Engineering. From 1973 to '77 he was Professor of Astronomy at the University of Maryland, temporarily becoming Visiting Astronomer at the Max-Planck-Institut f√ºr Radioastronomie (MPIfR) in Bonn, Germany 1973-74. From 1977-1993 he was Scientific Director at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington, DC. While there, he guided the evolution of that observatory toward astronomical data obtained from telescopes at the Flagstaff station, astrometric data produced by the techniques of radio interferometry and by innovative application of optical interferometry techniques (ground- and space-based.) Together with his wife Judith, he had 5 children ‚Äì Magda Cathleen, Gart, Bridget, Julian, and Anthony. When Edward L. G. Bowell discovered asteroid 5105 Westerhout, he named it in Westerhout's honor.  Memberships  Memberships include International Astronomical Union (IAU) (Commissions 33, 34, 40, 24 & 5), International Scientific Radio Union (URSI), American Astronomical Society (AAS), Royal Astronomical Society, and Sigma Xi. He contributed his scientific and management expertise widely, for example to IAU, National Science Foundation (NSF), AAS, National Research Council, Associated Universities Inc., Inter-Union Committee for the Allocation of Frequencies (IUCAF), URSI, National Radio Astronomy Observatory, MPIfR, MIT's Haystack Observatory, Arecibo Observatory, National Academy of Sciences.

It is used among cavers worldwide. Single-rope technique (SRT) is a set of methods used to descend and ascend on the same single rope. Single-rope technique is used in caving, potholing, rock climbing, canyoning, roped access for building maintenance and by arborists for tree climbing, although to avoid confusion in the tree climbing community, many have taken to calling it \\"stationary\\" rope technique. Historical developments In the 1930s, as caving became increasingly popular in France, several clubs in the Alps made vertical cave exploration an outdoor sport. During World War II, a team composed of Pierre Chevalier, Fernand Petzl, Charles Petit-Didier and others explored the Dent de Crolles cave system near Grenoble, France, which became the deepest explored cave in the world (-658m) at that time. The lack of available equipment during the war forced Pierre Chevalier and the rest of the team to develop their own equipment, leading to technical innovation. The first use of single-rope technique with prusik and mechanical rope ascenders (Henri Brenot's \\"monkeys\\", first used by Chevalier and Brenot in a cave in 1934) can be directly traced back to the exploration of the Dent de Crolles cave system. American caver Bill Cuddington, known as \\"Vertical Bill\\" developed single-rope techniques in the U.S. in the late 1950s. In 1958, two Swiss alpinists, Juesi and Marti teamed together, creating the first commercially available rope ascender known as the Jumar. In 1968 Bruno Dressler asked Petzl, who worked as a metals machinist, to build a rope-ascending tool, today known as the Petzl Croll, that he had developed by adapting the Jumar for pit caving. Petzl started a small caving equipment manufacturing company Petzl, which manufactures equipment for caving, climbing, mountaineering and at-height safety in civil engineering. The rappel rack was developed in the late 1960s by cavers in the Huntsville, Alabama caving club to facilitate long descents. The evolution of mechanical ascension systems helped extend the practice and safety of pit exploration. Ascent For ascent (prusiking or \\"jugging\\"), cammed devices (ascenders, Jumar, Petzl Croll) are used that can be pushed up the rope but lock and hold the user's weight when a downward force is applied; these must also be easily removable from the rope without being detached from the user. Knots such as the prusik, Bachmann and Klemheist are used to ascend ropes in emergencies in climbing and mountaineering; they have ceased to be the primary ascent method in single-rope technique because they are slow in use, and ice or mud greatly reduce their efficiency. Numerous prusik systems have been devised. Popular systems are: * Sit-stand systems (also known as frog rig) - one ascender is at chest level attached to the sit harness, and a second is held in the hand with a long loop of rope for the feet. Movement up the rope is by repeated moving of the foot loop ascender up the rope, pushing up with both feet together, and sitting, supported by the chest ascender. This motion appears like a frog kick. * Rope-walking systems - one ascender attached directly to one foot, and the second connected to the other foot by a rope with the ascender higher up to avoid clashing. Movement up the rope is by alternate stepping movements with the feet. Descent caver passing a deviation Modern single-rope technique uses specialized devices for both descent and ascent, and low-stretch kernmantel rope of 8-11 mm diameter. Descent (abseiling or rappeling) uses various forms of friction brake to control speed. The most commonly used are the Petzl Stop (self-locking) and Bobbin, and rappel racks. For safe single-rope technique, especially on drops with complex rigging with intermediate belays, it is essential that the abseiling device can be removed from the rope without being unclipped from the harness. This is a problem with the simplest device, the single piece figure eight. These also twist the rope, which is a problem if there is a rebelay below so the rope cannot untwist itself. Figure eights and racks do have the advantage of being able to be used on a doubled rope. Other essential items of a personal single-rope technique set are a sit harness and one or more safety cords (\\"cow's tails\\") terminated in carabiners, for temporary attachment to safety ropes at the heads of drops and used in maneuvers at intermediate rope belays. To pass intermediate belays on a descent, the ascending devices may also be required. Rigging How the rope is sent down a shaft has great bearing on the type of single-rope technique used. In general, while rope- walking techniques may be very effective for climbing long unobstructed pitches, they prove less versatile in cases of awkward passages and complex rope rigging with re-belays used to avoid hazards such as loose rocks, waterfalls, and rope damage from rub points. Rigging in the United States is typically done using a single anchor point, and pitches are rigged as a single long drop, often in excess of 100 meters. The rope is usually a thick abrasion-resistant type, which allows the rope to go over the lip of a shaft in contact with the rock. This is sometimes pejoratively called Indestructible Rope Technique. To descend such large drops on a bobbin-type descender would be difficult owing to the thickness and stiffness of the rope, and the resulting descent would be slow and jerky. The bobbin-descender could also overheat and melt the surface of the rope. Racks are preferred as they have a much larger heat sink capacity and offer a much smoother descent on such pitches. Using the frog system to ascend long pitches is time consuming, so rope-walking systems are preferred. In Europe, pitches are often more complex, and multi-pitch rigging is used extensively. Long drops are broken into smaller pitches. Re-belays and deviations are used to direct the rope away from areas of sharp rock and from water. Where rope rub cannot be avoided, rope protectors are installed. Traverses are often installed to allow the rigger to reach an area where it is possible to hang the rope with no rub. Since allowing the rope to rub against the walls is prevented, lighter ropes are used, usually 8-9mm thick. This has the advantage of being lighter and therefore more economical to carry on long or deep trips. Bobbin descenders are quicker to change over at re-belays and are also lighter to carry. Deviations are short length of tape or rope pulling the main rope to one side with a carabiner which can be conveniently unclipped and replaced to allow passing. Rope-walking techniques are less effective in cases of awkward passageways and for changeovers at rebelays. Many caves have been equipped with bolt holes consisting of internally threaded metal inserts fixed into holes drilled in the rock. Subsequent visitors carry their own belay eyelets to bolt into these points. Selecting the best position for bolts needs particular care, the aim often being to achieve a 'Y' shaped rope hang between two bolts on opposite walls. This technique can help to prevent the rope from coming in contact with the rock, shares the load between the two belays, and reduces the shock load should one fail (in comparison with the use of a slack backup rope).

Fast waters and a storm at the time gave no chance for an immediate rescue, and the victims drowned. The strong river current carried bodies downstream more than to the Atlantic ocean. Bodies were found as far away as the north coast of Spain and one even in France. Hours after the accident, the Minister of Transportation Jorge Coelho resigned. The following week, dozens of bridges across Portugal were closed for immediate repair. The tragedy caused widespread shock across the nation, with all television networks broadcasting continuous news bulletins, and many solidarity campaigns being organized to help the victims' relatives. The bridge had linked Castelo de Paiva and Entre-os-Rios. After the loss of the bridge, residents of Castelo de Paiva had to travel an additional 70 km to reach the Porto area. The bridge was more than 100 years old. The collapse was caused by uncontrolled sand extraction over many years, which compromised the stability of the bridge's pillars. Warnings from divers and technicians had been ignored. The sand extractors were prosecuted and sued.

The car was designed to compete as a trials car, and was constructed on an Austin 7 chassis and running gear and given registration number OX 9292. Chapman built the body utilizing a composite made of thin aluminum bonded to plywood. He modified the rear suspension to give better handling and the engine to give more power. His approach to automobile construction using sound engineering principles and ingenious chassis design set the stage for many more revolutionary designs to follow. Although the original Mark I has been lost to history after being bought by a mysterious buyer in 1950, a replica (see photo) was created to the same dimensions that uses an identical Austin chassis and running gear. Chapman and his future wife competed with the car in English Trials, a form of competition over rough terrain against time. Chapman continued to develop and modify the Mark I. First larger wheels and tyres were fitted and the front beam axle was split and hinged in the centre to provide independent front suspension. The success of the car helped encourage Chapman to continue designing competition cars.

It may be used in scattering of molecules, atoms, neutrons, photons or any other particles and is important mainly in atomic, molecular, and optical physics, nuclear physics and particle physics, but also for seismic scattering problems in geophysics. It relates the scattered wave function with the interaction that produces the scattering (the scattering potential) and therefore allows calculation of the relevant experimental parameters (scattering amplitude and cross sections). The most fundamental equation to describe any quantum phenomenon, including scattering, is the Schr√∂dinger equation. In physical problems, this differential equation must be solved with the input of an additional set of initial and/or boundary conditions for the specific physical system studied. The Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation is equivalent to the Schr√∂dinger equation plus the typical boundary conditions for scattering problems. In order to embed the boundary conditions, the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation must be written as an integral equation. For scattering problems, the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation is often more convenient than the original Schr√∂dinger equation. The Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation's general form is (in reality, two equations are shown below, one for the \\\\+ \\\\, sign and other for the \\\\- \\\\, sign): :  \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle =  \\\\phi \\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{E - H_0 \\\\pm i \\\\epsilon} V \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle. \\\\, The potential energy V \\\\, describes the interaction between the two colliding systems. The Hamiltonian H_0 \\\\, describes the situation in which the two systems are infinitely far apart and do not interact. Its eigenfunctions are  \\\\phi \\\\rangle \\\\, and its eigenvalues are the energies E \\\\,. Finally, i \\\\epsilon \\\\, is a mathematical technicality necessary for the calculation of the integrals needed to solve the equation. It is a consequence of causality, ensuring that scattered waves consist only of outgoing waves. This is made rigorous by the limiting absorption principle. Usage The Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation is useful in a very large number of situations involving two-body scattering. For three or more colliding bodies it does not work well because of mathematical limitations; Faddeev equations may be used instead. However, there are approximations that can reduce a many- body problem to a set of two-body problems in a variety of cases. For example, in a collision between electrons and molecules, there may be tens or hundreds of particles involved. But the phenomenum may be reduced to a two-body problem by describing all the molecule constituent particle potentials together with a pseudopotential. In these cases, the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equations may be used. Of course, the main motivations of these approaches are also the possibility of doing the calculations with much lower computational efforts.  Derivation  We will assume that the Hamiltonian may be written as :H = H_0 + V where is the free Hamiltonian (or more generally, a Hamiltonian with known eigenvectors). For example, in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics may be :H_0 = \\\\frac{p^2}{2m}. Intuitively is the interaction energy of the system. Let there be an eigenstate of : :H_0  \\\\phi \\\\rangle = E  \\\\phi \\\\rangle. Now if we add the interaction V into the mix, the Schr√∂dinger equation reads :\\\\left( H_0 + V \\\\right)  \\\\psi \\\\rangle = E  \\\\psi \\\\rangle. Now consider the Hellmann‚ÄìFeynman theorem, which requires the energy eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian to change continuously with continuous changes in the Hamiltonian. Therefore, we wish that  \\\\psi \\\\rangle \\\\to  \\\\phi \\\\rangle as V \\\\to 0. A naive solution to this equation would be : \\\\psi \\\\rangle =  \\\\phi \\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{E - H_0} V  \\\\psi \\\\rangle. where the notation denotes the inverse of . However is singular since is an eigenvalue of . As is described below, this singularity is eliminated in two distinct ways by making the denominator slightly complex, to give yourself a little wiggle room : : \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle =  \\\\phi \\\\rangle + \\\\frac{1}{E - H_0 \\\\pm i \\\\epsilon} V \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle. By insertion of a complete set of free particle states, : \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle =  \\\\phi \\\\rangle + \\\\int d\\\\beta\\\\frac{\\\\phi_\\\\beta\\\\rangle}{E - E_\\\\beta \\\\pm i \\\\epsilon} \\\\langle \\\\phi_\\\\beta V\\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} \\\\rangle, \\\\quad H_0 \\\\phi_\\\\beta\\\\rangle = E_\\\\beta\\\\phi_\\\\beta\\\\rangle, the Schr√∂dinger equation is turned into an integral equation. The \\"in\\" and \\"out\\" states are assumed to form bases too, in the distant past and distant future respectively having the appearance of free particle states, but being eigenfunctions of the complete Hamiltonian. Thus endowing them with an index, the equation becomes : \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)}_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle =  \\\\phi_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle + \\\\int d\\\\beta\\\\frac{T^{(\\\\pm)}_{\\\\beta\\\\alpha}\\\\phi_\\\\beta\\\\rangle}{E_\\\\alpha - E_\\\\beta \\\\pm i \\\\epsilon}, \\\\quad T^{(\\\\pm)}_{\\\\beta\\\\alpha} = \\\\langle \\\\phi_\\\\beta V\\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)}_\\\\alpha \\\\rangle. Methods of solution From the mathematical point of view the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation in coordinate representation is an integral equation of Fredholm type. It can be solved by discretization. Since it is equivalent to the differential time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation with appropriate boundary conditions, it can also be solved by numerical methods for differential equations. In the case of the spherically symmetric potential V it is usually solved by partial wave analysis. For high energies and/or weak potential it can also be solved perturbatively by means of Born series. The method convenient also in the case of many-body physics, like in description of atomic, nuclear or molecular collisions is the method of R-matrix of Wigner and Eisenbud. Another class of methods is based on separable expansion of the potential or Green's operator like the method of continued fractions of Hor√°ƒçek and Sasakawa. Very important class of methods is based on variational principles, for example the Schwinger-Lanczos method combining the variational principle of Schwinger with Lanczos algorithm. Interpretation as in and out states=The S-matrix paradigm In the S-matrix formulation of particle physics, which was pioneered by John Archibald Wheeler among others, all physical processes are modeled according to the following paradigm. One begins with a non-interacting multiparticle state in the distant past. Non-interacting does not mean that all of the forces have been turned off, in which case for example protons would fall apart, but rather that there exists an interaction-free Hamiltonian H0, for which the bound states have the same energy level spectrum as the actual Hamiltonian . This initial state is referred to as the in state. Intuitively, it consists of elementary particles or bound states that are sufficiently well separated that their interactions with each other are ignored. The idea is that whatever physical process one is trying to study may be modeled as a scattering process of these well separated bound states. This process is described by the full Hamiltonian , but once it's over, all of the new elementary particles and new bound states separate again and one finds a new noninteracting state called the out state. The S-matrix is more symmetric under relativity than the Hamiltonian, because it does not require a choice of time slices to define. This paradigm allows one to calculate the probabilities of all of the processes that we have observed in 70 years of particle collider experiments with remarkable accuracy. But many interesting physical phenomena do not obviously fit into this paradigm. For example, if one wishes to consider the dynamics inside of a neutron star sometimes one wants to know more than what it will finally decay into. In other words, one may be interested in measurements that are not in the asymptotic future. Sometimes an asymptotic past or future is not even available. For example, it is very possible that there is no past before the Big Bang. In the 1960s, the S-matrix paradigm was elevated by many physicists to a fundamental law of nature. In S-matrix theory, it was stated that any quantity that one could measure should be found in the S-matrix for some process. This idea was inspired by the physical interpretation that S-matrix techniques could give to Feynman diagrams restricted to the mass-shell, and led to the construction of dual resonance models. But it was very controversial, because it denied the validity of quantum field theory based on local fields and Hamiltonians. The connection to Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger Intuitively, the slightly deformed eigenfunctions \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} of the full Hamiltonian H are the in and out states. The \\\\phi are noninteracting states that resemble the in and out states in the infinite past and infinite future. Creating wavepackets This intuitive picture is not quite right, because \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} is an eigenfunction of the Hamiltonian and so at different times only differs by a phase. Thus, in particular, the physical state does not evolve and so it cannot become noninteracting. This problem is easily circumvented by assembling \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} and \\\\phi into wavepackets with some distribution g(E) of energies E over a characteristic scale \\\\Delta E. The uncertainty principle now allows the interactions of the asymptotic states to occur over a timescale \\\\hbar/\\\\Delta E and in particular it is no longer inconceivable that the interactions may turn off outside of this interval. The following argument suggests that this is indeed the case. Plugging the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equations into the definitions :: \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)}_g(t)=\\\\int dE\\\\, e^{-iEt} g(E)\\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} and :: \\\\phi_g(t)=\\\\int dE\\\\, e^{-iEt} g(E)\\\\phi of the wavepackets we see that, at a given time, the difference between the \\\\psi_g(t) and \\\\phi_g(t) wavepackets is given by an integral over the energy E. A contour integral This integral may be evaluated by defining the wave function over the complex E plane and closing the E contour using a semicircle on which the wavefunctions vanish. The integral over the closed contour may then be evaluated, using the Cauchy integral theorem, as a sum of the residues at the various poles. We will now argue that the residues of \\\\psi^{(\\\\pm)} approach those of \\\\phi at time t\\\\rightarrow\\\\mp\\\\infty and so the corresponding wavepackets are equal at temporal infinity. In fact, for very positive times t the e^{-iEt} factor in a Schr√∂dinger picture state forces one to close the contour on the lower half-plane. The pole in the (\\\\phi ,V \\\\psi^{\\\\pm}) from the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation reflects the time-uncertainty of the interaction, while that in the wavepackets weight function reflects the duration of the interaction. Both of these varieties of poles occur at finite imaginary energies and so are suppressed at very large times. The pole in the energy difference in the denominator is on the upper half-plane in the case of \\\\psi^{-}, and so does not lie inside the integral contour and does not contribute to the \\\\psi^{-} integral. The remainder is equal to the \\\\phi wavepacket. Thus, at very late times \\\\psi^{-}=\\\\phi, identifying \\\\psi^{-} as the asymptotic noninteracting out state. Similarly one may integrate the wavepacket corresponding to \\\\psi^{+} at very negative times. In this case the contour needs to be closed over the upper half-plane, which therefore misses the energy pole of \\\\psi^{+}, which is in the lower half-plane. One then finds that the \\\\psi^{+} and \\\\phi wavepackets are equal in the asymptotic past, identifying \\\\psi^{+} as the asymptotic noninteracting in state. The complex denominator of Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger This identification of the \\\\psi's as asymptotic states is the justification for the \\\\pm\\\\epsilon in the denominator of the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equations. A formula for the S-matrix The S-matrix S is defined to be the inner product :: S_{ab}=(\\\\psi^-_a,\\\\psi^+_b) of the ath and bth Heisenberg picture asymptotic states. One may obtain a formula relating the S-matrix to the potential V using the above contour integral strategy, but this time switching the roles of \\\\psi^+ and \\\\psi^-. As a result, the contour now does pick up the energy pole. This can be related to the \\\\phi's if one uses the S-matrix to swap the two \\\\psi's. Identifying the coefficients of the \\\\phi's on both sides of the equation one finds the desired formula relating S to the potential : S_{ab}=\\\\delta(a-b)-2i\\\\pi\\\\delta(E_a-E_b)(\\\\phi_a,V\\\\psi^+_b). In the Born approximation, corresponding to first order perturbation theory, one replaces this last \\\\psi^+ with the corresponding eigenfunction \\\\phi of the free Hamiltonian H0, yielding : S_{ab}=\\\\delta(a-b)-2i\\\\pi\\\\delta(E_a- E_b)(\\\\phi_a,V\\\\phi_b)\\\\, which expresses the S-matrix entirely in terms of V and free Hamiltonian eigenfunctions. These formulas may in turn be used to calculate the reaction rate of the process b\\\\rightarrow a, which is equal to S_{ab}-\\\\delta_{ab}^2.\\\\, Homogenization With the use of Green's function, the Lippmann‚ÄìSchwinger equation has counterparts in homogenization theory (e.g. mechanics, conductivity, permittivity).

It concerned a secret and officially unsanctioned military operation following the end of combat on the Soviet-Finnish theater of WWII known as the Continuation War, where a large amount of Finnish Army weapons and equipment was hidden in caches scattered around the country. Background Following the Moscow Armistice of September 19, 1944, two high- ranking officers in the Operational department of Finnish Military HQ, Colonel Valo Nihtil√§ and Lieutenant Colonel Usko Haahti, started planning countermeasures against a possible Soviet occupation of the country. They came up with the idea of decentralized storage of light infantry weapons, so that in case of occupation, an immediate guerrilla war could be launched. During the demobilization, an organization responsible for hiding the equipment was created and war materiel and other supplies were given to them for safekeeping. A total of 5,000‚Äì10,000 people participated in the operation. It was planned that they would cache supplies for 8,000 men, but the participants worked so eagerly that it is supposed they hid enough for 35,000 soldiers. The case started to unravel in the spring of 1945, when one man, who had stolen foodstuffs from the cache to sell them on the lucrative black market and feared reprisal from his comrades, divulged the existence of the caches to the Allied Control Commission (ACC). Initially the ACC was eager to follow the case, but after written orders from Nihtil√§ and Haahti surfaced, they left the investigation to Valpo, the much communist-controlled security police of Finland at the time. Valpo interrogated more than 5,000 people but failed to completely crack the case and find all the weapons. Most of the weapons were silently returned to army depots, and some were destroyed, but even today when old buildings are demolished, caches turn up every year. The investigators failed to find out how many people participated in the operation, as the participants tended to be reluctant to divulge meaningful information. While the operation was unofficial, there was no Finnish law under which those involved could be prosecuted. An ex post facto law was passed for the purpose in January 1947. In the end, 1,488 people were convicted, most of them sentenced to 1‚Äì4 months in prison. Decades later, in 1980, social democrat Arvo Tuominen, a former Finnish Communist leader, claimed that the weapons cache case was the tipping point which transferred the power within the Finnish Communist movement from the revolutionary to the parliamentary wing, as the communists feared armed resistance against revolutionary takeover. However, according to historian Kimmo Rentola and others, Tuominen's claims are to be treated very sceptically. Several private, unrelated, weapons caches have been found all over Finland after the war. One \\"famous\\" by Lauri T√∂rni and his fellow veterans. This cache included a light machine gun, semi- automatic rifle, 5 submachineguns, 3 rifles, 36 hand grenades and some 2000 rounds of ammunition. The Degtyaryov machine gun was later identified as the president Mauno Koivisto's issue weapon from his war service.  See also  *Alpo K.

It is based on the true-life story of the kidnapping and imprisonment of the Irish academic Brian Keenan and the English journalist John McCarthy, two of the hostages in the Lebanon hostage crisis. The film is based on Keenan's memoir, An Evil Cradling and Some Other Rainbow by John McCarthy who was a screenplay consultant. The film received widespread critical acclaim, being nominated for six awards, and winning a BAFTA. Plot Brian Keenan, a humourless bearded Irish academic, has moved to Beirut in the mid 1980s and works as an English teacher. As he leaves for work one day, four armed men in a car kidnap him and he is incarcerated. Keenan wakes up, almost naked, alone in an iron-clad room. Initially he refuses to eat until he is told why he is being held prisoner. He is kept on his own but eventually he is moved into a cell in a deserted house, where he is joined by another hostage, the English journalist John McCarthy, who had been reporting on Keenan‚Äôs kidnapping not long before he himself was abducted. The grumpy Brit-hating Irishman and the more pliable British journalist are forced to share their small prison cell. Keenan refuses to be shaved or wear clean clothes until he gets answers from his captors. He protests about having his beard shaved off. A grumpy idealist, Keenan sees his treatment by his Muslim jailers as equaling the British historic treatment of Ireland. McCarthy is neutral and pragmatic. The two men are periodically moved around to new hiding places. The pair slowly begin to bond as they make a temporary life together, playing chess, catching mosquitoes, trapping a mouse, telling stories and imagining they are somewhere else. They become very close friends and when one man is in trouble or close to the breaking point, the other invariably helps him. Their guards treat them with a mixture of detachment, kindness and cruelty. After another move, to a small, white-tiled cell, McCarthy is traumatized after being shown a video of his mother pleading for his return. He finds strength in Keenan's own brand of self-control. The two men are smuggled to a house in the countryside. Keenan attacks a young guard who is trying to humiliate him by making him open and close a window repeatedly. He is beaten. McCarthy intercedes with the leader of the captors saying this should not have been allowed to happen. He too is beaten. Eventually in 1990 after more than four years of imprisonment, Keenan is released. He is reluctant to accept his freedom if it means leaving McCarthy behind. Back in Ireland a year later, Keenan receives a call in a pub: McCarthy is to be released. He is waiting at the airport for McCarthy to arrive home.

It is the last-standing former residence of Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. The house dates from c. 1730, and Franklin lived and worked there for sixteen years.Tom Huntington \\"Franklin's Last Home,\\" American Heritage, April/May 2006. The museum opened to the public on 17 January 2006. The chairman is American- British investment banker and philanthropist John Studzinski.Benjamin Franklin House ‚Äì Governance . BenjaminFranklinHouse.org. The house is listed Grade I on the National Heritage List for England for its historic association with Franklin.  Conservation  The house was renovated and restored in 1998 by The Friends of Benjamin Franklin House in order for the house to be turned into a museum. During the excavation the remains of 10 individuals were identified, consisting of numerous bones and bone fragments; six of them identified as possible children.Newsletter of the friends of Benjamin Franklin House, Issue 2, Autumn 1998. benjaminfranklinhouse.org Tests conducted on the remains showed that they were around 200 years old, which means that they may have been buried in the basement at the same time that Franklin was living there. However, further evidence showed that a close friend of Franklin, William Hewson, was the one responsible for the human remains. Hewson, an early anatomist, had lived in the house for two years and had been working in secret, since there were still legal issues in dissecting certain cadavers at the time. Franklin likely knew what Hewson was doing, but probably did not participate in the dissections. The museum at 36 Craven Street is a Grade I listed property and retains a number of its original features (include original floorboards, original ceilings, and original staircases) with relatively few later alterations. Current conservation policies emphasise the need for minimal modern interventions. Artefacts at the house include a modern, playable replica glass armonica, based on Franklin's design.  Modern facilities  The \\"Historical Experience\\" includes an actor portraying historical characters associated with the house along with dialog, sound, lighting, and special effects. The character used in the \\"Historical Experience\\" is Polly Hewson, the daughter of Franklin's landlady who became a \\"second daughter\\" to Franklin. The \\"Student Science Centre\\" allows students to re-create experiments from Franklin's sojourn in London. It includes a Medical History Room (focused on the medical research of William Hewson, who did his work from the house for a time), a Discovery Room (containing historical artifacts), and a Demonstration Room (in which students can replicate Franklin's experiments). The Benjamin Franklin House is open free-of-charge to school visits on Tuesdays. Although designed for key stage 2 students, visits can be tailored for students of all key stages.Benjamin Franklin House School Visits, http://www.benjaminfranklinhouse.org/site/sections/education/school_visits.htm The \\"Scholarship Centre\\" on the top floor of the House is a centre for study of the many subjects Franklin pursued.

As with the Honeys, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys (Marilyn's then-husband) played an integral role with American Spring, producing some of their recorded material. Biography=Formation and early years After Ginger Blake, cousin of Marilyn Wilson and Diane Rovell, left the Honeys to go pursue a solo singing career in Las Vegas in 1970, the Honeys effectively dissolved as a group. In 1971, while in her sister's kitchen, Diane Rovell pushed the idea of continuing to create music with her sister Marilyn as a pop duo named \\"Spring\\". The band had their first official recording sessions at Brian Wilson's home studio in October 1971 and issued their first single \\"Now That Everything's Been Said\\" later that month. After releasing a second single, \\"Good Time\\" in May 1972, Spring released their first album, the self- titled Spring in July 1972.Marcus, Ben. Surfing USA!: An Illustrated History of the Coolest Sport of All Time Voyageur Press, San Francisco, California, 2005. Spring did not sell well in its time, but has since become a sought- after collectible. In late 1972, the band found some legal trouble as the UK based band Spring were threatening legal action, arguing they owned the rights to the use of the band's name. In order to avoid conflict, a compromise was made where Diane Rovell and Marilyn Wilson altered their band name to American Spring. A third band named Spring was also releasing music in Canada at this time. After releasing a third single, \\"Shyin' Away\\" in 1973 the band went dormant. Rebirth and later releases In 1977, following Brian Wilson's resurgence as a producer, American Spring once again commenced recording at Brother Studios, this time with Rocky Pamplin contributing to certain sessions. Though a substantial amount of material was recorded, personal matters which included the divorce of Marilyn and Brian caused Spring to once more become inactive. Some of these songs from both 1973 and 1977 have since come to find release though anthologies, rereleases and compilations. Tracks like \\"Snowflakes\\", \\"(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Do Ya?\\", \\"Slip On Through\\", \\"Don't Be Cruel\\" and \\"Sweet Sunday Kind of Love\\" are among this material. Rhino Records issued an anthology of American Spring's music during 1988, and a 1992 Capitol Records Honeys collection included several previously-unissued American Spring songs. The Honeys also re-formed during the 1990s, to perform locally around Hollywood.

Name Isidore's name has been interpreted by his editor and translator W.H. Schoff to indicate that he was from the city of Charax in Characene on the northern end of the present Persian Gulf. However, the Greek charax merely means \\"palisade\\" and there were several fortified towns that bore the name. Parthian Stations Isidore's best known work is \\"The Parthian Stations\\" (, Stathm≈ìÃÅ Parthic≈ìÃÅ; ), an itinerary of the overland trade route from Antioch to India along the caravan stations maintained by the Arsacid Empire. He seems to have given his distances in schoeni (\\"ropes\\") of debated value. Isidore must have written it some time after for it refers to the revolt of Tiridates II against Phraates IV, which occurred in that year. In its surviving form, \\"The Parthian Stations\\" appears to be a summary from some larger work. A reference in AthenaeusAthenaeus of Naucratis. Deipnosophistae, iii.46. suggests that the title of the greater work was A Journey around Parthia (, t√≤ t√™s Parth√≠as periƒìgƒìtic√≥n). Athenaeus's reference, not included in the present text of \\"The Parthian Stations\\", is a description of pearl fishing.

It is Isidore who is cited for the relevant measurements of geographic distances.Pliny. Natural History, ii.112, iv.5, iv.30, iv.37, v.6, v.9, v.35-39, v.43.

For his second car Chapman built on the knowledge gained from building and competing in the Lotus Mark I, so he again used the widely available and inexpensive Austin 7 chassis as a starting point. He boxed in the chassis rails and replaced the cross members with stronger tubular braces. He swapped the Austin engine for a Ford engine and transmission, first from a Ford 8, then from a Ford 10, but retained the Austin 7 rear axle. To be able to use a wider tyre, Chapman adapted Ford pressed-steel wheels. He modified the engine as far as the club rules would allow. Chapman used this chassis and running gear to support a cigar-shaped body with a rounded nose. It has rudimentary cycle-type mudguards. The result was a very competitive trials car, but one also suitable for circuit racing. Chapman used the car to compete in events sponsored by the 750 Motor Club. Although Chapman built the car to compete in English Trials events, he also entered the car in track events, such as Silverstone, where he won in his class. From that point forward, Chapman concentrated on designing and constructing cars for race circuits instead of trials.

The channel was shown between the hours of 21:00 and 05:30 each night, with a subscription required after 23:30. History The channel started on Sky Channel 995. When Sky's channels were rearranged in February 2006, it moved to channel 911 and was renamed Sex Station. The channel returned to its original name in 2008, moving to channel 957. On 26 June 2009, the channel was removed from Sky's Electronic Programme Guide. The reason for its removal is unknown. Concept The channel usually broadcast live, featuring two women on the main screen, with between two and four \\"sub-screens\\" on the right hand side showing additional women labelled \\"Babe number #\\". The women on the main screen encouraged viewers to call the (premium rate) telephone numbers to speak with one of the women in the sub- screens while they posed in a sexually provocative way. They also encouraged viewers to send text messages (again at a premium rate), which they might read out, and performed acts usually of a sexually orientated nature. The women on the main screen also took telephone calls on given nights and occasionally switched positions from the main screen to a sub-screen. For the first hour, the women usually wore bikinis. They could flash their breasts, but usually kept their bikinis on‚Äîsuch brief upper-body nudity is permitted by the UK watershed regulations. Between 22:00 and 23:00 the bikini tops were removed. At 23:00 a warning message was shown to inform viewers the subsequent part of the show may be sexually explicit, and the women on the main screen usually removed their bikini bottoms. Alternatively, the channel would go full-screen with all the women together on one large bed; although those engaged in calls with phone-in viewers would continue their conversation with the viewers listening-in on the woman's side of the conversation, which might be sexually explicit. FTG One aspect that was unique to the channel compared to its UK peers was the FTG feature. At around 23:28, just before the channel switched to the subscription-only service for the rest of the night, the main screen would expand to fill the whole screen, all the women would gather on the main screen and remove their thongs exposing their pubic area to the camera. The feature was promoted as FTG - \\"Flash the gash\\". The channel then showed a blue screen for non-subscription viewers, or continued on eventually to the late show for subscribed viewers of the channel. From 2006, the FTG feature was phased out for unspecified reasons, although incoming text messages continued to make references to FTG.

It is located approximately northwest of Steinbach on Provincial Road 216, one kilometre south of Provincial Road 311 and six kilometres north of Highway 52. It has a population of approximately 500. New Bothwell is serviced by a post office, a restaurant/convenience store, recreation centre, an elementary/junior high school, a fire station, and two nearby churches. The local Chamber of Commerce and the local recreation committee organize community events such as an annual fall dinner, the winter carnival, and the summer fair. History The New Bothwell area were originally lands of the nomadic Ojibway-speaking Anishinabe people. The Anishinabe people signed Treaty 1 in 1871 and moved onto reserves such as the Brokenhead Indian Reserve and Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation Reserve. In 1874, Mennonites began immigrating to the area from the Bergthal Colony in southern Russia (now Ukraine). Several small villages were established throughout the East Reserve, although nearly all have disappeared. One of the original East Reserve villages was Kronsthal (generally translated as \\"Crown Valley\\" although local historians suggest \\"Crane Valley\\" may have been the intent), which was located on the western edge of what is now New Bothwell. It consisted of a few farms and a private school, among other things. The first public school districts in the area - Arran, Moray, Seaton, and Bothwell - were created in 1919. The Bothwell School was located a half mile east of Kronsthal. Not long after the school was opened, businesses (such as the cheese factory in 1936) and families began to locate themselves near the school, and the entire village ended up moving a half mile east. Over the years, New Bothwell did eventually expand westward to encompass the former site of Kronstal. The name \\"Bothwell\\" originates with the establishment of the Bothwell School in 1919. The Canadian government deliberately chose British names, such as Mitchell, Randolph, Bothwell, and others in an attempt to assimilate the Mennonites into Canadian culture. The town, however, remained under the name Kronsthal until 1939, when the post office was established. \\"Bothwell\\" had been the first choice to register as the community's official name, as it was the name of the public school. However, this name was already registered in Ontario, so the word \\"New\\" was added to the town name. By the 1960s, New Bothwell remained as the only village in the surrounding area. The old school districts that served the area were eliminated and replaced with a new government run school at New Bothwell, part of the new Hanover School Division. Although no longer in existence, the old villages and school districts are still referred to by those who remember them. In the 1990s, the Rural Municipality of Hanover established a fire station at New Bothwell, one of four operated by the municipality's fire department. Bothwell Cheese New Bothwell Cheese Factory located in the town. New Bothwell is home to award-winning cheese producer Bothwell Cheese. Established in 1936, Bothwell Cheese was originally a co-operative owned by the local dairy producers. Over the years, Bothwell Cheese has earned a solid reputation as a world-class cheese maker, producing over 25 varieties of cheese, and made the community known for its cheese.

A sequel, titled Fay Grim, was released in 2006. Another sequel, titled Ned Rifle, was released in 2014. Plot Socially inept garbage-man Simon Grim is befriended by Henry Fool, a witty rogue and untalented novelist. Henry opens the world of literature to Simon, and inspires him to write \\"the great American poem.\\" Simon struggles to get his work recognized, and it is often dismissed as pornographic and scatological, but Henry continues to push and inspire Simon to get the poem published. Henry carries around a bundle of notebooks that he refers to as his \\"Confession,\\" a work that details aspects of his mysterious past that he one day hopes to publish, when he and the world is ready for them. Henry's hedonistic antics cause all manner of turns in the lives of Simon's family, not least of which is impregnating Fay, Simon's sister. As Simon begins an ascent to the dizzying heights of Nobel Prize-winning poet, Henry sinks to a life of drinking in low- life bars as his own attempts at fame result in rejection, even by Simon's publisher who once employed Henry.

It is recognized world-wide for its leadership in addressing orbital debris issues. The NASA Orbital Debris Program Office has taken the international lead in conducting measurements of the environment and in developing the technical consensus for adopting mitigation measures to protect users of the orbital environment. Work at the center continues with developing an improved understanding of the orbital debris environment and measures that can be taken to control its growth. Orbital Debris research at NASA is divided into several broad research efforts, involving modeling, measurements, protection, mitigation and reentry of orbital debris.  Modeling  NASA scientists continue to develop and upgrade orbital debris models to describe and characterize the current and future debris environment. Engineering models, such as ORDEM2000, can be used for debris impact risk assessments for spacecraft and satellites, including the International Space Station and the Space Shuttle. Evolutionary models, such as EVOLVE and LEGEND, are designed to predict the future debris environment. They are reliable tools to study how the future debris environment reacts to various mitigation practices. ORDEM2000 was replaced in 2010 by ORDEM2010. This release represents a significant improvement in the NASA ODPO‚Äôs empirically-based debris assessment modeling program. This version of the long-running series includes ten years of additional data, new validated high-fidelity environment models, new statistical processes for data and model analysis, the extension of the modeling through GEO, the inclusion of debris material density, and a new spacecraft-encompassing igloo analysis package, with an advanced companion GUI.  Measurements  Measurements of near-Earth orbital debris are accomplished by conducting ground-based and space-based observations of the orbital debris environment. Data is acquired using ground-based radars and optical telescopes , space-based telescopes, and analysis of spacecraft surfaces returned from space. Some important data sources have been the U.S. Space Surveillance Network, the Haystack X-Band Radar, and returned surfaces from the Solar Max, Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), and the Space Shuttle spacecraft. The data provide validation of the environment models and identify the presence of new sources. Protection Orbital debris protection involves conducting hypervelocity impact measurements to assess the risk presented by orbital debris to operating spacecraft and developing new materials and new designs to provide better protection from the environment with less weight penalty. The data from this work provides the link between the environment defined by the models and the risk presented by that environment to operating spacecraft and provides recommendations on design and operations procedures to reduce the risk as required. These data also help in the analysis and interpretation of impact features on returned spacecraft surfaces. The primary facility for this research is the Hypervelocity Impact Technology Facility (HIT-F) at NASA JSC in Houston, although there are other facilities at JSC, New Mexico, and various DoD laboratories.  Mitigation  Controlling the growth of the orbital debris population is a high priority for NASA, the United States, and the major space-faring nations of the world to preserve near-Earth space for future generations. Mitigation measures can take the form of curtailing or preventing the creation of new debris, designing satellites to withstand impacts by small debris, and implementing operational procedures ranging from utilizing orbital regimes with less debris, adopting specific spacecraft attitudes, and even maneuvering to avoid collisions with debris. In 1995 NASA was the first space agency in the world to issue a comprehensive set of orbital debris mitigation guidelines. Two years later, the U.S. Government developed a set of Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices, based on the NASA guidelines. Other countries and organizations, including Japan, France, Russia, and the European Space Agency (ESA), have followed suit with their own orbital debris mitigation guidelines. In 2002 after a multi-year effort, the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), comprising the space agencies of 10 countries as well as ESA, adopted a consensus set of guidelines designed to mitigate the growth of the orbital debris population. These guidelines were formally presented to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space in February 2003.  Reentry  Because of the increasing number of objects in space, NASA has adopted guidelines and assessment procedures to reduce the number of non-operational spacecraft and spent rocket upper stages orbiting the Earth. One method of postmission disposal is to allow reentry of these spacecraft, either from orbital decay (uncontrolled entry) or with a controlled entry. Orbital decay may be achieved by firing engines to lower the perigee altitude so that atmospheric drag will eventually cause the spacecraft to enter. However, the surviving debris impact footprint cannot be guaranteed to avoid inhabited landmasses. Controlled entry normally occurs by using a larger amount of propellant with a larger propulsion system to drive the spacecraft to enter the atmosphere at a steeper flight path angle. It will then enter at a more precise latitude, longitude, and footprint in a nearly uninhabited impact region, generally located in the ocean. Spacecraft that re-enter from either orbital decay or controlled entry usually breakup at altitudes between 84-72 km due to aerodynamic forces causing the allowable structural loads to be exceeded. The nominal breakup altitude for spacecraft is considered to be 78 km. Larger, sturdier, and denser satellites generally breakup at lower altitudes. Solar arrays frequently break off the spacecraft parent body around 90-95 km because of the aerodynamic forces causing the allowable bending moment to be exceeded at the array/spacecraft attach point. After spacecraft (or parent body) breakup, individual components or fragments will continue to lose altitude and receive aeroheating until they either demise or survive to impact the Earth. Many spacecraft components are made of aluminum, which has a low melting point. As a result, these components usually demise at a higher altitude. On the other hand, if an object is made of a material with a high melting point, (e.g., titanium, stainless steel, beryllium, carbon-carbon), the object will demise at a lower altitude and in many cases will survive. Also, if an object is contained inside a housing, the housing must demise before the internal object receives significant aeroheating. Some objects may have a very high melting point temperature such that they can never demise, but are so light (e.g., tungsten shims) that they impact with a very low velocity. As a result, the kinetic energy at impact is sometimes under 15 J, a threshold below which the probability of human casualty is very low. Thus, the debris casualty areas computed for these objects do not figure into the total debris casualty area in a reentry survivability analysis. The reentry survivability of spacecraft components is computed by either of two NASA methods. One is the Debris Assessment Software (DAS), a conservative, lower-fidelity software tool found under the \\"Mitigation\\" section and the second is a more accurate and higher- fidelity software tool called the Object Reentry Survival Analysis Tool (ORSAT).

It was a not-for-profit organisation, and was situated in the City Centre under Glasgow Central station and the West Coast Main Line in the brick arches of the viaduct leading into the station, with entrances on Midland Street, and (since 2001) an entrance underneath Hielanman's Umbrella on Argyle Street. The venue had of floor space which was spread over two floors and seven arches. In June 2015, The Arches announced on their website that the company would go into administration and had no choice but to close down the facility, due to licensing issues caused by the drug-related death of a young woman. History The site of the venue was a previously derelict area below the Glasgow Central railway station, which was converted to house the exhibition Glasgow's Glasgow during the city's year as European City of Culture. In 1991, after the exhibition had ended, the space was obtained by Andy Arnold, who would become the venue's artistic director, for the purposes of creating a theatre. Realising that theatre productions required substantial funding, Arnold decided to stage nightclub events to support his projects, and this practice continued until the venue's closure, the clubbing revenues helping to fund what became one of Europe's leading cultural venues. In early 2007, The Arches was voted 12th best club in the world by DJs in a DJ Magazine poll. In January 2008, Andy Arnold left The Arches to become the artistic director at the Tron Theatre. He was succeeded as Artistic Director and Joint Chief Executive by Jackie Wylie, formerly the venue's Arts Programmer. In April 2015, The Arches announced on Facebook that their nightclub licence had been removed from them. DJs, artists, performers showed anger all over the world. A petition started to reinstate the licence gained over 40,000 signatures, while over 400 figures from the Scottish cultural scene, including Irvine Welsh, Liz Lochhead and members of Franz Ferdinand, Belle and Sebastian and Mogwai, signed a letter asking the Scottish government to ensure that The Arches remained open as an arts venue. In June 2015, The Arches announced on social media that the company would go into administration and would have no choice but to close down the facility. The Arches building was reopened as Platform food market since February 2018.  Theatre  Arnold set up The Arches Theatre Company to perform interpretations of work by playwrights including Samuel Beckett, Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Harold Pinter and two unperformed works by the novelist James Kelman, generally receiving favourable ratings from the Scottish Arts Council. He was also inspired by the size and atmospherics of the space to put on unusual productions such as Arthur Miller's The Crucible in the building's damp, dark basement with the audience seated on church pews, Metropolis - The Theatre Cut, a promenade version of Fritz Lang's film featuring a cast of 100, and a staging of Seamus Heaney's translation of the epic poem Beowulf. For the building's fifteenth anniversary in 2006, Arnold conceived and directed the critically acclaimed production Spend A Penny, a series of one-on-one monologues staged in the venue's toilet cubicles, featuring work by playwrights including Liz Lochhead. When Jackie Wylie took over the arts programme in 2008, The Arches built on its increasing reputation for nurturing emergent talent from across the country. The Guardian's theatre critic Lyn Gardner described the venue's significance under Wylie's direction: > The Arches was one of the reasons that in recent years Glasgow has become a > magnet for young performance-makers; many of those who forge careers there > take the work on to festivals and theatres across the world. It is as > significant as Battersea Arts Centre, in London, in the way it nurtures > tomorrow. Between 2008 and 2015, The Arches developed a whole new generation of playwright-performers, including Rob Drummond, Kieran Hurley, Gary McNair and Julia Taudevin, and performance artists like Nic Green, Robert Softley Gale and Adrian Howells. Wylie commissioned and developed international touring multi-award-winning productions including Nic Green's Trilogy, Rob Drummond's Bullet Catch and Kieran Hurley's Beats. Drummond credits The Arches with allowing him to develop his work into a career in theatre. Having rebranded and redeveloped the nine-year-old Arches Theatre Festival into Behaviour, an internationally significant festival of contemporary performance which brought companies and artists like Mammalian Diving Reflex, Ontroerend Goed, Gob Squad, The TEAM, Ann Liv Young, Taylor Mac and Tim Crouch to Scotland, Wylie also co-commissioned performances such as DEREVO's Natura Morte, and Linder Sterling's 13 hour performance Darktown Cakewalk.  Nightclub events  The Arches played host to club nights since 1992 with some nights being promoted by outside companies and others being in-house productions. Notable long- running regular clubs to be held in the venue included: Slam at the Arches One of the first club nights to be hosted in The Arches, Slam ran every Friday between 1992 and 1998. Originally the night was held in now defunct Glasgow venue Tin Pan Alley and later The Sub Club. It was hosted by local techno producers Slam but also featured regular guests, most notably Underworld and Daft Punk (in their first UK appearance in 1997). Pressure In 1998, after six years of running Friday club nights at The Arches, Slam created a bigger, monthly event, Pressure, on the last Friday of every month. The night had at least two rooms of music playing mainly house and techno. Pressure saw some of the largest names in dance music play The Arches, including Jeff Mills, Carl Craig, Derrick Carter, Richie Hawtin, Laurent Garnier, Felix da Housecat, Ricardo Villalobos, Boys Noize, Vitalic, and Erol Alkan. Other club nights Other well-established club nights at the Arches included: * Colours (1995) * Inside Out (1996) * Death Disco (2002) * Octopussy (2005) Alien Wars In 2008, The Arches reprieved its Alien War attraction, which originally took place in 1992, and transformed it into Alien Wars. The initial show was an Alien-inspired tour, recreating the atmosphere and horror of the Alien films. Many celebrities were linked to this attraction, when staged in London, including: Sigourney Weaver, who participated; Sylvester Stallone, whose restaurant was next door, and declined to take part; and, Michael Jackson, whose bodyguards visited but apparently didn't finish the tour. Sigourney Weaver, when asked to comment on her experience, said \\"Although I have been through the movies, I was screaming as much as everyone else.\\" The organisers, who had a contract for the first attraction with 20th Century Fox, the copyright holders to the Alien franchise, decided to go beyond this limitation and develop their own storyline, thus freeing themselves of the contractual constraints imposed by Fox. The 2008 storyline is centred on an alien vessel being discovered in the basement by workmen, guarded by the military for the last couple of years, and to which visitors are escorted by \\"space marines\\".

In modern times, after approaching within of the Dez River, it turns to the southwest and then, northwest of Ahvaz, turns northwest and is absorbed by the Hawizeh Marshes that straddle the Iran‚ÄìIraq border. Its peculiarly sweet water was sacred to the use of the Persian kings. Ancient names for the Karkheh should be treated as conjectural because the bed of the river has changed in historic times, and because a nearby watercourse between the Karkheh and the Dez River, the Shaur, confuses the identification.John Hansman, \\"Charax and the Karkheh,\\" Iranica Antiqua VII(1967), pp.21-58, and Michael J. Kirkby, \\"Land and Water Resources of the Deh Luran and Khuzistan Plains,\\" Appendix I, in Studies in the Archaeological History of the Deh Luran Plain. The Excavation of Chagha Sefid, edited by Frank Hole, pp. 251-288. Memoirs, no. 9, Ann Arbor, Museum of Anthropology, University of Michigan The problem with the ancient names is that while the Karkheh flows a kilometre or two west of Susa, another major watercourse flows parallel to the Karkheh within a few kilometres east of Susa. When these rivers are in flood stage, the entire area south of Susa can be flooded, as the waters of the two watercourses mingle. The watercourse a kilometre or two east of Susa, now called the Shaur, flows east between the Haft Tepe and Shaur ridges into the Dez River, north of where the Dez and Karun rivers merge. At some previous time, the Karkheh may have joined the eastern end of the Shaur. The timing of these changes is not known with any certainty. The ancient name of the Shaur may have been the Choaspes. The river is mentioned in the Bible, Book of Daniel 8:2,16,\\"In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the first. And I saw in the vision; now it was so, that when I saw, I was in Shushan the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in the vision, and I was by the river Ulai.\\" (Daniel, 8:2)\\"And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the vision.\\" (Daniel, 8:16) and should not be confused with the Choaspes River in modern-day Afghanistan, which flows into the Indus. The river is currently the location of the Karkheh Dam and hydro-power plant in Iran.

Established in 1857, the college is the oldest Roman Catholic, and second-oldest overall, university college in Australia. St John's is a co-educational community of 252 undergraduate and postgraduate students. The rector, Adrian Diethelm, has held his position since 2013. History thumb275pxSt John's College, built in the Gothic Revival style, as seen from Parramatta Road. \\\\---- [http://www.virtualtour.com.au/melocco/st_johns/VT/index.html Virtual Tour of St John's College] The College of St. John the Evangelist was founded by Archbishop John Bede Polding, who named it after the author of the fourth Gospel. The symbol of St John's College is the eagle, the traditional symbol of St. John. St. John's is the oldest Catholic tertiary educational institution in Australia, and the first Catholic college to be established in a preexisting, non-Catholic university in the English-speaking world since the Reformation. In 1854, the first effort to establish a Catholic college within the University of Sydney was made at a meeting in old St Mary's Cathedral. The New South Wales government promised a pound-for-pound subsidy capped at a ¬£20,000 limit, if at least ¬£10,000 were raised by public subscription. The amount was met within six months from July 1857. On 15 December 1857, the act to incorporate St John's College as a college within the University of Sydney passed in the Parliament of New South Wales, and received the Royal Assent from Queen Victoria. The proclamation of the St John's College Council took place on 1 July 1858. In 1887, James Francis Hogan wrote in The Irish in Australia that \\"Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview, St. Joseph's College, Hunters Hill and St John's College, affiliated to the University of Sydney, are three educational institutions which reflect the highest credit on the Catholic population of the parent colony\\".\\"The Irish in Australia\\"‚Äîby James Francis Hogan, 1887. Reproduced by Project Gutenberg (retrieved 15 June 2006). English Benedictine influence St. John's was established as a Benedictine foundation by Archbishop Polding, who had formerly been an English Benedictine monk at Downside Abbey. The English Benedictines were prominent in the raising of public support for the founding of St John's; Dom Maurus O'Connell, Dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney, and the first Australian-born Benedictine priest, was appointed as the first rector of the college in 1858. When Roger Bede Vaughan, a former monk of Downside Abbey, arrived in Sydney as Polding's coadjutor bishop in 1873, he was elected by the fellows as rector. Vaughan retained the rectorship until he succeeded Polding as archbishop in his own right, but continued to live in the college and use it as his episcopal palace.A.E. Cahill, Archbishop Vaughan and St. John's College, University of Sydney, Journal of the Australian Catholic Historical Society, 14 (1992), 36-49. Vaughan's secretary‚ÄîAnselm Gillett, a monk of Ampleforth, who had been resident at Belmont Priory during Vaughan's time as superior before his departure for Australia‚Äîacted as rector during Vaughan's time as archbishop. After Vaughan's death and Gillett's return to England, another Benedictine, Fr. David Barry, was appointed rector in 1884. In the latter part of the 19th century, the College Council was dominated by clerical fellows who were Benedictine monks, and the majority of its students were affiliated with Benedictine Lyndhurst College, Glebe.Sons of St Benedict: The English Benedictines and St John's College, Peter Cunich, 1987. The carved Gothic- style reliquary box in the chapel contains the skull of St. Bede the Lesser, a Benedictine monk who died before AD 1000. The relic had been preserved in a reliquary in the church of St. Benignus at Genoa, served by the Benedictine monks of Monte Cassino until the early 19th century. The relic was transported to Sydney by the missionary priest Martial Mary and presented to Archbishop Vaughan while he was residing in the college. Governance Government of the college is vested in the College Council by the 1857 Act of Incorporation The Council consists of the Rector and eighteen Fellows, six of whom must be Catholic clergy. The Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, currently the Most Rev. Anthony Fisher, takes the role of Visitor of the college. This is a largely ceremonial role, but he can also be called on to give guidance and resolve internal disputes. Under the direction of the Archbishop as Visitor, the College associates itself with the interests of the Church and its mission, particularly by the fostering of appropriate academic directions in education, charity, social justice, ethics and the environment.An Act to Incorporate Saint John's College as a College within the University of Sydney, Assented to 15 December 1857, , viewed 2007. RectorsVisitorsFellows St John's College has a number of honorary fellows. These are distinguished members of the university and wider community who have been selected to support the rector by representing the interests of the college in their own spheres and by mentoring students Student club The student club is the body that looks after much of the day-to-day activity of the students of the college. Formed in 1891, the club is governed by its own constitution and is led by its house committee. This committee is elected by the students at the end of each academic year. The activities of the club are varied, ranging across social, cultural, sporting, and disciplinary areas. The house committee comprises the House President, House Secretary, House Treasurer and six committee members. Architecture=Architects In February 1859, William Wilkinson Wardell, the architect of St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney and St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne, was appointed the architect for St John's College. Working from his design for Melbourne, he drew up general plans and sent them to Sydney in May 1859. Wardell originally designed St. John's College as a three-story sandstone Gothic Revival building on an H-shaped plan. Because of budget restrictions, with a limit of ¬£30,000, in July and August there was discussion of Wardell's design and of how much of it could be built. In September and October the general plans were approved by the St John's Council and the university senate. From October 1859 to April 1860, relations between Wardell and the council deteriorated for various reasons, resulting in Wardell's resignation in June 1860. With the main building program already in progress, the council retained Wardell's plans and proceeded with the construction under the supervision of Edmund Blacket, another of Australia's best-known colonial architects, who had finished construction of the first stage of St. Paul's College, Sydney, the previous year. When Blacket was appointed to supervise the construction of St John's, several changes were made to Wardell's specifications: Australian hardwood was substituted for pitch pine, bar trusses were used in the chapel, a fountain was dropped from the plans, common rather than fire bricks were used, Portland stone was replaced by Colonel stone, and ornamental pillars were incorporated into the design of the library. Blacket estimated that these and other changes would save ¬£1,689, leaving the amended quote at ¬£35,754 pounds. When the college was finally occupied, the cost of construction for the first stage was ¬£40,000. Eastern elevation from St John's oval, showing original building with new additions Menzies Wing (left) and Freehill Tower (right) Original building St John's College is perhaps the grandest Gothic Revival building in New South Wales. Designed by one of England's (and Australia's) foremost ecclesiastical architects of the mid-19th century, it is unique in Sydney collegiate architecture in its combination of scale, quality and construction. A rare realisation of Pugin's ideal Catholic college (and in turn based on Magdalen College, Oxford), it demonstrates the influence of Pugin on the work of William Wardell. It is a notable example of the period when Pugin's insistence on archaeological accuracy was giving way to the more eclectic influences of the High Victorian generation. Freehill Tower foyer Built entirely in sandstone, the college is 14th century English Gothic in style, and substantially Renaissance Baroque in plan, in the manner of Wardell's earlier monasteries and convents. The principal floor or piano nobile is above the ground floor and is related to a central space (the ante-chapel) by a series of classical enfilades. The arrangement of the ground floor entry vestibule, and the formal, axially linked Imperial staircase are equally classical in inspiration. In this respect St John's is unlike the traditional layout of an English university college. The formal parts of the building are very grand, particularly if compared to the almost domestic scale of Blacket's contemporary St Paul's College. The main facade on the north wing is a typical exercise in Victorian near-symmetry, with the central tower nearly in the middle. Under the tower is a porte-coch√®re. Continuing south along the visitor's line of entry on the main axis is a visually low, dark vestibule. This enhances the view, through an open arcade and transverse passage, of the more brightly sidelit formal stone staircase. To the north of the stair hall on the principal floor is the central space. To the east of this space is the chapel, viewed through an arcaded screen. To the south is a vista across the stairwell, through an ante-room to the library and on to the students' accommodation. To the west is the Great Hall, although this was not visible from the central space on Wardell's original design. Lastly, through a wide opening to the north is the Lady Chapel in the tower. =Chapel and Lady Chapel= The Chapel of St John's College, unusual in being located on the first floor, was completed in 1863. The chapel has a plan that includes five bays. The two bays at the east end are distinguished as a chancel by a change in floor level. The eastern half of the chapel is in the traditional collegiate Choir arrangement. The details of the tracery and mouldings are late 13th and early 14th century English Gothic. There is a small gallery over the chapel, originally designed to enable invalids from the infirmary to hear Mass. The chapel is covered by a high wooden roof Many of the sanctuary furnishings are believed to have been designed by Blackett in the 1860s, including the Blessed Sacrament shrine, which is made of Bondi Gold sandstone, the tabernacle, cedar choir stalls and pews. The walls of keyed sandstone were originally covered in plasterwork with Pugin-like decoration, but the plasterwork was completely removed in 1963. The chapel's wrought-iron gates were designed by Herbert Wardell and George Denning and installed in 1921. The chapel contains five stained glass windows, three of which were commissioned in 1918 from John Hardman and Co., Birmingham, with the design based on the writings of St. Bonaventure, quoted by Cardinal Newman. The eastern window, also from Hardman and Co., was presented to the college by Countess Freehill in 1937, in memory of her late husband, Francis Bede Freehill. The embellished sanctuary and Lady Chapel mosaics were also presented by Countess Freehill and laid by Melocco Co., in 1916‚Äì17 and 1937 respectively (approximately the same time as the Kelly Chapel floor at St Mary's Cathedral). The sanctuary features an oak reredos and panelling designed by Herbert Wardell, as well as two life- sized carved statues of the Virgin Mary and St. John the Evangelist, which were made by Koffmefer of Munich. =Great Hall= The Great Hall (dining hall) The Great Hall, or dining hall, is a space with a large wooden roof of collar beams and arched braces, with king post and raking queen posts. Each truss is visually supported by short stone shafts with foliate capitals and corbels in the early 14th century manner, as is the tracery. The formal entry stairs intended to be placed to the south have never been built, and the original eastern wall has been replaced by an open arcade. On the western wall of the Great Hall is the Purcell Window, completed in 1930 by Hardman & Co. Birmingham. The upper windows contain the coats of arms of the universities of Sydney, Oxford (trefoils), Cambridge (trefoils), Paris (left soufflet) and St. John's College (right soufflet). The Great Hall has on display a collection of portraits of past visitors, rectors, fellows, and students, with the most significant portrait being Archbishop Polding / Gallery oil painting of Archbishop Polding DSB, 1866, by Eugene Montagu Scott (1835‚Äì1909), which was originally commissioned for St Mary's Cathedral. =Brennan Hall and library= St John's College Library Brennan Hall is named after the notable Australian poet and classical scholar Christopher Brennan (1870‚Äì1932), who was a regular visitor and close friend of Maurice J. O'Reilly, the then rector. Brennan Hall has a double arcade of slender wooden piers. Each pier has four engaged shafts with appropriate bases and capitals supporting arched braces. All motifs are in the 14th century manner, like the reticulated tracery in the square loaded windows. Brennan Hall is more grand than convenient, as it is a major thoroughfare. The library holds several collections of books donated by past rectors and fellows of the college, contained in custom-made locked shelving units as a private library of books of historical relevance to the college. The stained glass windows on the eastern and western walls of the library are by Hardman & Co., Birmingham. The eastern windows contain the coats of arms of Bishop Davis, Archbishop Polding, St John's College, and Archbishop Vaughan. The western windows contain the coat of arms of William Bernard Ullathorne, Cardinal Moran and Archbishop Kelly. Later developments: 1918‚Äìpresent In 1918, Wardell's son, Herbert, working with his partner George Denning, designed what is known as the '38 wing (it was eventually begun in 1938), estimating the cost at ¬£14,000. Construction was not started for 20 years because of lack of funds and was finally finished on a reduced scale in 1939. In 1937 Countess Freehill donated ¬£15,000 to the college on the conditions that it be used for the erection of the tower and that Hennessy and Hennessy be the architects. The design for the tower was 10 metres shorter than Wardell would have liked. Wardell believed that without the full height of the tower, the horizontal aspect of the building would not be balanced. Nonetheless the tower was built to the amended design. Artist's impression of proposed buildings The 1960s saw great activity, with extensions to the college. In 1961, one hundred years after the first construction, Menzies Wing On the east end of the South Range was begun. The architects were McDonell, Mar and Anderson. The Menzies Wing was opened by the Right Honourable Robert Menzies and blessed by Cardinal Norman Gilroy on 14 May 1961. In 1962 the refectory was extended through to where the sacristies were, leaving an open arcade where the eastern wall had been. The Polding Wing was built on the west end of the South Range in 1967 and opened by Sir Roden Cutler and blessed by Archbishop James Caroll on 26 November 1967. Although these wings are four-storeyed and very different to the design of Wardell, the architects have looked back to his design for guidance and inspiration. Their modifications of Wardell's original design enabled the present building to accommodate 181 students. Student life Crowds on the front lawns, 1936 St. John's College offers a traditional Oxbridge-style \\"collegial\\" experience of university life, situated on grounds within the University of Sydney's main campus.St John's College ‚Äì Handbook , , viewed 2007. Academic life The college is primarily an academic community. Academic assistance is provided to scholars by the academic coordinator, assisted by a team of resident and non- resident tutors comprising senior and postgraduate scholars and university teaching staff and academics. The tutorial program is comprehensive (over 50 subjects per week), designed to supplement the teaching programs provided by the university. Chapel The St. John's College chapel was completed in 1863 in the Gothic Revival style as part of the northern wing and longitudinal arm of the college. The chapel is actively used as a place of worship and also for weddings, concerts, and other college events. Catholic Mass is celebrated in the chapel weekly on Sundays at 5.30 pm during the academic year, and on other important liturgical occasions. Each Wednesday after formal dinner night prayer is held in the chapel. Adoration and Benediction is held regularly throughout the semester and during stu-vac. All students of the college are encouraged to worship as a community, and the chapel is kept open at all times for prayer and personal reflection. Formal dinners Formal dinner in the Great Hall Formal dinners are held at 6.30 pm on Mondays and Wednesdays throughout the academic year. Attendance is mandatory and all members of the College must wear an academic gown and dress appropriately ‚Äì men with jacket and tie, women in dress or skirt. There are ample occasions during the academic year when either black tie or lounge suit for men and ballgown or evening gown for women are worn, depending on the event. At formal dinners, traditional formalities are observed. Students enter the Hall and stand in place prior to the arrival of the members of High Table ‚Äì the Rector, members of the Senior Common Room and other invited guests ‚Äì who process in after the gong has been sounded. Grace is then said in Latin. Late arrivals should bow to the Rector (or Visitor) and be acknowledged. It is considered discourteous to leave the Hall before the final Grace. Sport College tennis courts and sports grounds Sport is an important aspect of collegial life. St. John's College teams compete against the other Sydney colleges in a wide range of sports for the Rawson Cup (men's sport) and the Rosebowl Cup (women's). The Rawson Cup was donated by Sir Harry Rawson in 1906. The Rawson sports are played throughout the university year, including cricket, rowing, rugby, swimming and diving, soccer, tennis, basketball, and athletics. Other sports which feature in the Rosebowl Cup are hockey, netball and softball. The college has expansive sporting facilities, including a rugby oval, football oval, cricket nets, and floodlit tennis and basketball courts. All college residents are also members of Sydney Uni Sport and Fitness and are entitled to access to all exclusive member benefits and services, including three on- campus gymnasiums and an indoor aquatic centre. Social and cultural The Dail, bar next to Junior Common Room Major events each year include a college play, an informal, and two black tie formal, balls, and the intercollegiate debating competition. The Student Club operates a bar, 'The Dail', in the area adjacent to the Junior Common Room. Music and drama The college choir sings at Mass in the chapel regularly and also performs on other occasions. Concerts to showcase the musical talents of students are presented each year. Arts of Gold is a bi-annual event which showcases the artistic talents of St. John's students to raise money for a selected charity. The college takes part in the Intercollegiate Debating Cup every year, competing with the other colleges of the University of Sydney. Competition is of a high standard, with many college teams consisting of university debaters. The college competes in the Palladian Cup, in which the colleges compete in solo and group instrumental and dramatic performance. St. John's won the Palladian Cup in 2007 and 2019. The college enjoys a close relationship with Capella Sublima, an a cappella vocal consort based at St. John's College, where its singers rehearse. In the European Renaissance, a cappella was a group of musicians attached to a cathedral or the court of a monarch. Capella Sublima specialises in choral masterworks of the European Renaissance. Its extensive repertoire includes Josquin, Lassus, Palestrina, Victoria, Guerrero, Tallis and others. Capella Sublima have been recorded for broadcast by ABC Classic FM and numerous other Sydney radio stations.Capella Sublima website, , viewed 2007. International students Currently over ten per cent of St. John's residents come from overseas. Students are present from the United States, Canada, China and Hong Kong, Great Britain, Ireland, New Zealand, Zimbabwe, and South Africa.

The film is a sequel to Hartley's 1997 film Henry Fool, and revolves around the title character, played by Parker Posey, the sister of Simon Grim (James Urbaniak). The plot revolves around Fay's attempt to unravel an increasingly violent mystery in Europe.The New York TimesLA WeeklyThe Village Voice The film was shot almost entirely in Dutch angles, meaning the vast majority of shots are framed diagonally, or \\"tilted\\". At the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, Hartley revealed that the two shots in the film's final cut that are not \\"Dutched\\" occurred when he and the film crew forgot to tilt the camera. Plot Seven years after the events of Henry Fool, Fay Grim (Parker Posey) is coerced by a CIA agent (Jeff Goldblum) to try to locate 'the confession novel' notebooks that belonged to her fugitive husband (Thomas Jay Ryan) whom he believes to be deceased. Fay is launched into a world of espionage as she travels to Paris to retrieve some of the journals, each having mysteriously appeared in the hands of the most unlikely of people. Simon Grim, Fay's brother and Nobel Prize‚Äìwinning poet because of Henry, remains home with his sister's son, the CIA and his publisher. Even in death it seems Henry is a force of nature causing life changing ructions in the lives of those he has touched. Fay is surrounded by competing agents all vying for her help in retrieving notebooks as she and Simon start getting clues to what the unpublishable nonsense of The Confession is really all about and why the CIA believe they contain information that could compromise U.S. security. A former air-hostess befriends Fay and reveals she was similarly touched by Henry's chaotic influence and aid her in her efforts. Fay's whirlwind culminates in a tense meeting with a notorious terrorist and friend of Henry where she has to make the biggest decision of her life.

It encloses the thigh muscles and forms the outer limit of the fascial compartments of thigh, which are internally separated by intermuscular septa. The fascia lata is thickened at its lateral side where it forms the iliotibial tract, a structure that runs to the tibia and serves as a site of muscle attachment. Structure The fascia lata is an investment for the whole of the thigh, but varies in thickness in different parts. It is thicker in the upper and lateral part of the thigh, where it receives a fibrous expansion from the gluteus maximus, and where the tensor fasciae latae is inserted between its layers; it is very thin behind and at the upper and medial part, where it covers the adductor muscles, and again becomes stronger around the knee, receiving fibrous expansions from the tendon of the biceps femoris laterally, from the sartorius medially, and from the quadriceps femoris in front. Function The fascia lata surrounds the tensor fasciae latae muscle. It is a fibrous sheath that encircles the thigh subcutaneously. This encircling of the muscle allows the muscles to be bound together tightly. Above and behind The fascia lata is attached, above and behind (i.e. proximal and posterior), to the back of the sacrum and coccyx; laterally, to the iliac crest; in front, to the inguinal ligament, and to the superior ramus of the pubis; and medially, to the inferior ramus of the pubis, to the inferior ramus and tuberosity of the ischium, and to the lower border of the sacrotuberous ligament. From its attachment to the iliac crest it passes down over the gluteus medius to the upper border of the gluteus maximus, where it splits into two layers, one passing superficial to and the other beneath this muscle; at the lower border of the muscle the two layers reunite. Laterally Laterally, the fascia lata receives the greater part of the tendon of insertion of the gluteus maximus, and becomes proportionately thickened. The portion of the fascia lata attached to the front part of the iliac crest, and corresponding to the origin of the tensor fasciae latae, extends down the lateral side of the thigh as two layers, one superficial to and the other beneath this muscle; at the lower end of the muscle these two layers unite and form a strong band, having first received the insertion of the muscle. This band is continued downward under the name of the iliotibial band and is attached to the lateral condyle of the tibia. The part of the iliotibial band which lies beneath the tensor fasciae latae is prolonged upward to join the lateral part of the capsule of the hip joint. Below Below, the fascia lata is attached to all the prominent points around the knee joint, viz., the condyles of the femur and tibia, and the head of the fibula. On either side of the kneecap it is strengthened by transverse fibers from the lower parts of the vasti muscles (three of the four quadriceps) which are attached to and support this bone. Of these the lateral are the stronger, and are continuous with the iliotibial band. The deep surface of the fascia lata gives off two strong intermuscular septa, which are attached to the whole length of the linea aspera and its prolongations above and below; the lateral intermuscular septum, the stronger of the two, extends from the insertion of the gluteus maximus to the lateral condyle, separates the vastus lateralis in front from the short head of the biceps femoris behind, and gives partial origin to these muscles; the medial intermuscular septum is the thinner one and separates the vastus medialis from the adductor muscles. Besides these there are numerous smaller septa, separating the individual muscles, and enclosing each in a distinct sheath. Deep fascia of leg The deep fascia of the lower leg is a continuation of the fascia lata.Anatomy.med Clinical significance=Transplantation Since the 1920s fasciae latae from deceased donors have been used in reconstructive surgery. In 1999 preserved mashed fasciae latae became FDA-approved as a tissue product designed to replace areas of lost fascia or collagen. The fascia lata normally performs the function of encircling and tightening the muscles in the thigh. Because of this function, it has been used as grafts for patients with facial paralysis. The fascia lata offers supports to the muscles that make up the face and this support increases the recovery of the facial muscles. The surgeons use the fascia lata as a sort of facial sling to support up the paralyzed face and loops the fascia lata around the center of the lower lip, the corner of the mouth and the center of the upper lip. A small portion of fascia lata harvested through a sub centimeter skin incision on the lower lateral side of the thigh is used for reconstructing the ear drum in tympanoplasty surgery. A larger portion is used in nasal endoscopic skull base surgery. History=Etymology It is named from its great extent. \\"Latus\\" give the superlative \\"Latissimus\\" meaning broadest or widest.

The Salvadoran army, being vastly superior, executed those who stood against it. The rebellion was a mixture of protest and insurrection which ended in ethnocide, claiming the lives of an estimated 10,000 and 40,000 peasants and other civilians, many of them Pipil people. Background Social unrest in El Salvador had begun to grow in the 1920s, primarily because of the perceived abuses of the political class, and the broad social inequality between the landowners and the Pipils. A U.S. Army officer stated in 1931 that, \\"there appears to be nothing between these high-priced cars, and the oxcart with its barefoot attendant. There is practically no-middle class.\\" The policies of the latifundia had left 90 percent of the country's land in the hands of 14 families, 'los catorce', who used the land for the cultivation of the cash-crop coffee.Uppsala Conflict Data Program Conflict Encyclopedia, El Salvador, In Depth, Negotiating a settlement to the conflict, http://www.ucdp.uu.se/gpdatabase/gpcountry.php?id=51&regionSelect;=4-Central_Americas#, viewed on May 24, 2013 The Salvadoran economy had largely depended on the coffee bean during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, so much so that this period is known as the \\"Coffee Republic\\" era. The national coffee-growing industry had grown with the accumulation of riches of a small group of landowners and merchants who had purchased large portions of land and employed a great number of peasants, many of whom were indigenous. Working conditions at the haciendas were very poor. By 1930, pay consisted of two tortillas and two spoonfuls of beans at the beginning and end of each day. Furthermore, workers were paid in scrip which could only be redeemed at stores controlled by the plantation owners. This led to local monopolies which drove up the price of food. It is estimated that food costs for laborers were no more than $0.01 per day, creating considerable profits for plantation owners. Coffee beans were the main produce of El Salvador In 1932, the head of a U.S. delegation in San Salvador, W.J. McCafferty, wrote a letter to his government explaining the Salvadoran situation, stating that farm animals were worth more than workers as they were in high demand and had better commercial value. The global economic situation caused by the Great Depression fostered the lack of opportunities in countries such as El Salvador. Due to the drop in coffee prices, several haciendas were closed and many peasants lost their jobs, creating deep economic turmoil. Although the crisis affected people all over the country (and almost all of Latin America), the crisis was more acute in western El Salvador. The policies of presidents P√≠o Romero Bosque and Arturo Araujo had stripped almost all land from the local peasants. This area was heavily populated by the indigenous Pipils. The indigenous people, separated from the scarce economic progress, sought help from their own leaders. Although the law did not grant any powers or official recognition of the caciques, the natives respected and obeyed their authority. The political class had often sought the approval of the caciques in order to gain support of their people during elections. Arturo Araujo, elected President of El Salvador in 1931 In order to alleviate the economic crisis, the Pipil had organized themselves into cooperative partnerships, through which employment was provided in exchange for their participation in Catholic festivities. The cacicques led these partnerships, and represented the unemployed before the authorities and supervised their work. Feliciano Ama, for example, was one of the most active caciques and was highly esteemed by the indigenous population. Ama had arranged for economic assistance from president Romero in exchange for supporting his candidacy. On the other hand, the crisis intensified due to the permanent conflict between the indigenous and non-indigenous populations. Naturally, the non-indigenous people had better relations with the government; when riots or fighting occurred, it was indigenous leaders who were arrested and sentenced to death. The rebellion was also preceded by political instability. El Salvador had been ruled since 1871 by economic liberal elites who had presided over a long period of relative stability. By World War I, the presidency effectively rotated between the Mel√©ndez and Qui√±√≥nez families in quasi-dynastic succession. In 1927, P√≠o Romero Bosque was elected President and embarked on political liberalisation that led to what was arguably the first free election in Salvadoran history, which was held in 1931. Arturo Araujo was elected during the 1931 elections, amid a severe economic crisis. After a military coup, vice president Maximiliano Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez assumed control of the country in December 1931, marking the beginning of El Salvador's military dictatorship. Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez's regime was characterized by the severity of its laws and punishments. For example, theft was punished with the amputation of a hand. Mart√≠nez strengthened police forces and was especially aggressive in matters of rebellion, issuing the death penalty against anyone who opposed the regime. Though Mart√≠nez's rule may have satisfied the military, popular discontent continued to build and the government's opponents continued to agitate. Within weeks, communists, believing the country was ready for a peasant rebellion, were plotting an insurrection against Mart√≠nez. Causes of the conflict Many incidents and situations directly influenced the conflict. On one side, the Salvadoran Army was organized to fend off any uprisings. The peasants (indigenous and non- indigenous) were beginning to rise up against the local authorities in an unorganized manner. Finally, the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCS) became involved in activities which led to the uprising. The Salvadoran Army in 1932 The army was organized into regiments of infantry, artillery, machine guns and cavalry. The most commonly used weapon was the German-made Gewehr 98. The air force did not play a decisive role, as its participation at the time was limited to reconnaissance. The army was under the direct orders of the President and had the defense of the State as its primary objective. The different security forces included the National Police, the National Guard and the Hacienda Police. Preceding peasant rebellions Given the circumstances of poverty and inequality, some peasants who were stripped of their land and subjected to poorly paid work began to rebel against the landlords and the authorities. This began on an individual basis, which made it easier for the authorities to detain or threaten the rebels. The big landlords had close ties to military authorities, so defense of the haciendas was performed by official security forces. After several arrests, the peasants began to organize in a low profile manner, lacking any hierarchical system. Therefore, efforts remained isolated and disperse and were easily suppressed. Security forces arrested rebels, many of whom were later sentenced to death by firing squad or hanging. There is no data on the number of executions carried out in the weeks prior to the massacre. However, it is known that many peasant leaders were convicted, as were many public officials who collaborated with them in any way. The Communist Party of El Salvador Agust√≠n Farabundo Mart√≠, leader of the Communist Party of El Salvador At the same time as the conflicts between indigenous people, peasants, landowners and authorities, the Communist Party of El Salvador (PCS) began distributing pamphlets and registering new members. Activities were fuelled by frustration over broken promises by the government and political parties. The communist leaders, led by Farabundo Mart√≠, had built a political organization that managed to obtain the sympathy of the population. After the coup d'√©tat of 1931, the press gained more freedom to express dissenting views, and the PCS increased the spread of their revolutionary message. Although they lacked a definite party platform, the PCS registered candidates for the January 1932 elections. Electoral processes in that era were subject to serious criticism. Votes had to be made publicly with the authorities. This practice broadly favored official candidates by sowing fear among voters and hindering democratic participation. After the elections, accusations of fraud led the communist leadership to abandon faith in the electoral process and take the path of uprising. The uprising was planned for mid-January 1932, and included the support of communist-sympathizers in the military. Before the revolt could take place, police arrested Mart√≠ and other communist leaders. Authorities seized documents proving the planned insurrection, which were used as evidence in military trials. Despite the moral and organizational blow suffered by the PCS, the insurrection was not canceled. By the end of January 1932, the national situation had become chaotic. Security forces detained any groups or individuals involved in subversive or revolutionary acts. Meanwhile, the indigenous population in the West began to revolt in protest of poor living conditions. There is no evidence to support the position that the peasant uprising was carried out by the PCS, but due to the dates on which both uprisings occurred, the armed forces responded equally to both movements. The uprising In the late hours of January 22, 1932, thousands of peasants in the western part of the country rose up in rebellion against the regime. Rebels led by the Communist Party and Agust√≠n Farabundo Mart√≠, Mario Zapata and Alfonso Luna, attacked government forces with support that was largely from the indigenous Pipils. Armed primarily with machetes, peasants attacked haciendas and military barracks, gaining control over several towns, including Juay√∫a, Nahuizalco, Izalco, and Tlacopan. Barracks in towns such as Ahuachap√°n, Santa Tecla, and Sonsonate resisted the attack and remained under government control. It is estimated that peasant rebels killed no more than 100 people. Confirmed deaths include about twenty civilians and thirty soldiers. The first city to be taken was Juay√∫a, where landowner Emilio Radaelli was assassinated. His wife was raped and later murdered. Several other military leaders and government officials were also executed. Differing accounts of the event exist, and it is difficult to ensure which is correct since there were very few survivors of the rebellion. It is said that indigenous peoples attacked privated property and committed vandalism and other crimes against entire towns. There is evidence to support this claim, though it is possible that these were merely opportunists joining the uprising to carry out criminal acts. The participation of the indigenous peoples and peasants in the looting cannot be conclusively confirmed or denied. The primary motive of the events, however, can be guaranteed. The relationship between the peasants and the Communist Party is also controversial. The coincidental timing of both uprisings and the similar causes lead to the conclusion that they were linked, or even coordinated. Some theories contend that the PCS used the economic turmoil to convince the peasants to act together and rise against the regime. Little to nothing is known about the relation between the two groups. Authors such as Erik Ching affirm that the PCS could not possibly have directed the insurrection, as the party held little influence over the peasant population and was hampered by in-fighting. Regardless, the government made no distinction between either movement. Government reaction The government reacted swiftly, recovering lost territory by means of a military deployment aimed at suppressing the rebellion. With their superior training and technology, the government troops needed only a few days to defeat the rebels. General Jos√© Tom√°s Calder√≥n enjoyed an abundance of troops and weapons: The civil guards were volunteers who took up service for the security forces to assist in patrolling, and when necessary, fought alongside the military. On January 23, the Canadian warships Skeena and Vancouver docked at the Port of Acajutla. The ships were requested by Britain, in order to protect any British citizens in the country. U.S. ships arrived shortly after. The ships' crews were also prepared to assist the Salvadoran government in quelling the rebellion. However, the chief of operations in El Salvador turned down the offer, stating: Although the exact number of deaths in the first 72 hours after the uprising is unknown, several historians agree that it was around 25,000 people. Those who were captured alive were sent to trial and inevitably sentenced to death. After the rebellion, peasant leader Francisco S√°nchez was hanged. His counterpart, Feliciano Ama, was lynched and his body was later hung in the town square while schoolchildren were forced to attend. In the areas around Izalco, anyone found carrying a machete, and anyone with indigenous features or clothing, was accused of subversion and found guilty. In order to ease the work of the security forces, all those who had not participated in the insurrection were invited to present themselves in order to obtain documents which declared their innocence. Upon arrival they were examined, and those with indigenous features were arrested. They were shot in groups of 50 in front of the wall of the town church, Iglesia de La Asunci√≥n. Several were forced to dig mass graves, which they were thrown into after being shot. The houses of those found guilty were burned and the surviving inhabitants were shot. According to the commander of the operacion, 4,800 members of the PCS were killed, although this figure is difficult to verify. After the conflict, survivors attempted to flee to Guatemala; in response, president Jorge Ubico ordered the border to be closed, handing over anyone who attempted to cross to the Salvadoran army. As resolution of the conflict, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador issued Legislative Decree No. 121 on July 11, 1932, which granted unconditional amnesty to anyone who committed crimes of any nature in order to \\"restore order, repress, persecute, punish and capture those accused of the crime of rebellion of this year.\\" Aftermath Having put down the rebellion, the government of Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez began a process of repression of the opposition, and utilized the voter registry to intimidate or execute those who had declared themselves opponents of the government. As the killings particularly targeted people of indigenous appearance, dress, or language, in the decades that followed, Salvadoran indigenous peoples increasingly abandoned their native dress and traditional languages from fear of further reprisals.\\"El Salvador: before the war,\\" Enemies of War, PBS companion web site for the documentary film of the same name.

The events brought about the extermination of the majority of the Pipil-speaking population, which led to a near total loss of the spoken language in El Salvador. The indigenous population abandoned many of their traditions and customs out of fear of being arrested. Many of the indigenous people who did not participate in the uprising stated that they did not understand the motivation of the government's persecution. Over the years, the indigenous population has fallen to the point of near extinction in the 21st century. In the decade following the uprising, military presence in the area was persistent with the objective of keeping the peasants under control so that the events did not recur. After the dictatorship of Hern√°ndez Mart√≠nez, the method of preventing peasant discontent changed from repression to social reforms which benefitted them (at least momentarily). In 2010, president Mauricio Funes apologized to the indigenous communities of El Salvador for the brutal acts of persecution and extermination carried out by previous governments. The statement was made during the inauguration of the First Congress of Indigenous Peoples. \\"In this context and this spirit, my government wishes to be the first government to, on behalf of the State of El Salvador, of the people of El Salvador, and of the families of El Salvador, make an act of contrition and apologize to the indigenous communities for the persecution and extermination of which they were victims during so many years,\\" said the president. Commemorations In the town of Izalco, the uprising is commemorated on every January 22. Media coverage is moderate, but the commemoration is supported by municipal authorities who pay tribute to all who were killed during the event. Speakers include people who lived through the event, and relatives of Feliciano Ama.

It is located three kilometers west of Steinbach, Manitoba along Provincial Highway 52, and has a population of 2,279 as of 2016.Stats Canada 2011 Census History The area that is now known as Mitchell were originally lands of the nomadic Ojibway-speaking Anishinabe people. On 3 August 1871 the Anishinabe people signed Treaty 1 and moved onto reserves such as the Brokenhead Indian Reserve and Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation Reserve. The area was then settled by Russian Mennonite settlers in the 1870s. At that time there were dozens of villages in the East Reserve. Two of them, Vollwerk and Reichenbach, were eventually absorbed into the new community of Mitchell, which was named after the surrounding school district. The Canadian government deliberately chose English names, such as Mitchell, New Bothwell, Randolph and others in an attempt to assimilate the Mennonites into Canadian culture. Education The Mitchell School District was established in 1919. A one-room schoolhouse served the community until the 1950s, when another room has added to handle increasing student enrollment. In 1968, the school district was dissolved and became part of the newly formed Hanover School Division, after which students from Mitchell were required to attend school in Steinbach. The school division has since constructed new elementary and middle schools in Mitchell and only high school students from the Mitchell area are presently required to attend school in Steinbach. Recreation Mitchell has a full range of community-run recreational facilities, including an indoor arena, baseball fields, soccer pitches, and tennis courts. The Mitchell Arena was built in 1979 and is home to community's ice hockey teams, nicknamed the Mitchell Mustangs, which play in various Eastman Minor Hockey leagues. The Mitchell Mohawks have been members of the Hanover Tache Junior Hockey League since 1987 and previously played in the Manitoba Junior 'B' Hockey League. The Mohawks has also fielded senior teams in the past that played in the Hanover-Tache and Carillon Senior Hockey Leagues. Businesses and services Mitchell's close proximity to the city of Steinbach means residents mostly shop and conduct business at the latter. However, Mitchell does have several of its own businesses and services, such as a Co-op gas bar and convenience store, a second convenience store, a number of churches, an auto repair business, and an assortment of home-based business. Government Mitchell is designated as a local urban district (LUD) within the Rural Municipality of Hanover whose administrative offices are located 1.5 kilometers east of the community. An elected LUD committee, consisting of three members plus the Ward 2 Councillor for Hanover, reports to the municipal council. The community and surrounding area is part of the Steinbach (provincial) and Provencher (federal) electoral districts.

(29.5 kg), was added to cut down drag, and the engine was extensively modified to produce more power. The car, for all its seeming delicacy, proved startlingly faster than the competition. It led to a demand for copies (an improved Mark IIIB (registered as ONK 408) was built for Adam Currie, for instance, was the first Lotus to be sold to a customer and the first car to wear the Lotus badge), as well as copies of the earlier Mark I. By the end of the racing season, it was apparent the Mark III was the best 750 Formula car in England. The Mark III could reach 50 mph in 6.6 seconds and had a top speed of 90 mph. At this time, Chapman was still working full-time at British Aluminum, and creating cars at nights and racing them, with the help of enthusiastic volunteers, on the weekends, but it was clear from the performance of the Mark III, and the demand, there was an opportunity here. Following this successful year, on 1 January 1952, Chapman established Lotus Engineering Company, with Michael Allen becoming Chapman's first business partner. They set up shop in a disused stable in Hornsey.

The word is derived from tele = remote (Greek), and command = to entrust/order (Latin). Systems that need remote measurement and reporting of information of interest to the system designer or operator require the counterpart of telecommand, telemetry. The telecommand can be done in real time or not depending on the circumstances (in space, delay may be of days), as was the case of Marsokhod.  Examples  *Control of a TV from the sofa *Remote guidance of weapons or missiles *Control of a satellite from a ground station *Flying a radio-controlled airplane  Transmission of commands  For a Telecommand (TC) to be effective, it must be compiled into a pre- arranged format (which may follow a standard structure), modulated onto a carrier wave which is then transmitted with adequate power to the remote system. The remote system will then demodulate the digital signal from the carrier, decode the TC, and execute it. Transmission of the carrier wave can be by ultrasound, infra-red or other electromagnetic means.  Infrared  Infrared light makes up the invisible section of the electromagnetic spectrum. This light, also classified as heat, transmits signals between the transmitter and receiver of the remote system. Telecommand systems usually include a physical remote, which contains four key parts: buttons, integrated circuit, button contacts, and a light-emitting diode. When the buttons on a remote are pressed they touch and close their corresponding contacts below them within the remote. This completes the necessary circuit on the circuit board along with a change in electrical resistance, which is detected by the integrated circuit. Based on the change in electrical resistance, the integrated circuit distinguishes which button was pushed and sends a corresponding binary code to the light-emitting diode (LED) usually located at the front of the remote. To transfer the information from the remote to the receiver, the LED turns the electrical signals into an invisible beam of infrared light that corresponds with the binary code and sends this light to the receiver. The receiver then detects the light signal via a photodiode and it is transformed into an electrical signal for the command and is sent to the receiver‚Äôs integrated circuit/microprocessor to process and complete the command. The strength of the transmitting LED can vary and determines the required positioning accuracy of the remote in relevance to the receiver. Infrared remotes have a maximum range of approximately 30 feet and require the remote control or transmitter and receiver to be within a line of sight.  Ultrasonic  Ultrasonic is a technology used more frequently in the past for telecommand. Inventor Robert Adler is known for inventing the remote control which did not require batteries and used ultrasonic technology. There are four aluminum rods inside the transmitter that produce high frequency sounds when they are hit at one end. Each rod is a different length, which enables them to produce varying sound pitches, which control the receiving unit. This technology was widely used but had certain issues such as dogs being bothered by the high frequency sounds.  New applications  Often the smaller new remote controlled airplanes and helicopters are incorrectly advertised as radio controlled devices (see Radio control) but they are either controlled via infra-red transmission or electromagnetically guided. Both of these systems are part of the telecommand area.  Encryption  To prevent unauthorised access to the remote system, TC encryption may be employed. Secret sharing may be used.

Chapman's success at building trials cars brought another previous customer, Mike Lawson, to order a second trials car in 1952 to replace his Lotus Mark II, in which he won the Wrotham Cup. Once again Chapman chose an Austin Seven as the starting point, reinforcing the frame and installing a four-cylinder , Ford, sidevalve engine. Chapman used all the tricks he had learned in his previous cars, constructing a lightweight aluminum body with a rounded nosecone. He fitted a 3-speed transmission taken from a Ford 8 and the divided front axle as on his previous cars. Lawson won his class in the first attempt in this car, following up with others, solidifying Chapman's reputation as a designer and engineer.

It was originally owned by Contel, and later purchased by GTE, Verizon, and then sold to Frontier. History The company was established in 1956 to provide telephone service in Georgia. As a subsidiary of Contel, it adopted the name Continental Telephone Company of the South. It expanded as it absorbed the operations various companies in Alabama and Georgia, including Alabama Telephone Company in 1975, Coosa Valley Telephone Company, and Tri-County Telephone Company, Incorporated in 1978.Business Entity Details, Contel of the South, Inc., Alabama Secretary of State The company adopted its abbreviated name, Contel of the South, Inc., in 1988. Acquisition by GTE Contel was acquired by GTE in 1991 and the operating company began doing business as GTE Systems of the South. It was not associated with GTE South, a separate operating company. On October 31, 1993, Contel of the South and Alltel traded service regions. Contel of the South regions in Georgia area were traded for Alltel's Indiana and Michigan service regions. Acquisition by Verizon In 2000, GTE was purchased by Bell Atlantic, becoming Verizon. Contel of the South began doing business as Verizon Mid-States and Verizon North Systems. In 2002, Verizon sold its operations in Alabama, including those from Contel of the South and GTE South to CenturyTel. Those operations became CenturyTel of Alabama. This left the company, incorporated in Georgia, with operations in Indiana and Michigan. The company remained one of two former GTE operating companies to have retained its original name since acquisition by Verizon (the other is GTE Southwest); it also remained the only operating company using the Contel name.

The 2002 Expanded Edition CD of the album includes a demo version of \\"Danny Says\\" among the bonus tracks. The song has since been covered and released by the Foo Fighters and Tom Waits. Background and content \\"Danny Says\\" is a love song written by singer Joey Ramone at the Tropicana Motel in Los Angeles when the Ramones were staying there for the recording of End of the Century. The \\"Danny\\" alluded to in the title is the Ramones' manager Danny Fields. The romantic inspiration for the song is believed to be Linda Daniele, Joey's girlfriend at the time. Later in Summer 1982 she ended her romantic involvement with Joey to extend her relationship with the band's guitarist Johnny Ramone who she moved in with in autumn that year.\\"Commando. The Autobiography of Johnny Ramone\\" Page 97, paragraph 5, Abrams Image books, 2012. Although this virtually stopped dialogue between the two bandmates that was already limited since the time of recording End of the Century, both remained in the Ramones until the band split up in 1996.

Another reference in the song is to Christmas, reflecting the difference at that time of year between where the band were recording in Los Angeles and the Ramones' home town of New York City - \\"It ain't Christmas if there ain't no snow\\". The lyrics also refer to a character named Sheena (\\"Listening to Sheena on the radio\\"). \\"Sheena Is a Punk Rocker\\" is a track on the 1977 Ramones album Rocket to Russia. Band member reaction Johnny later commented on working with Phil Spector on the recording of the album, \\"It really worked when he got to a slower song like 'Danny Says'‚Äîthe production really worked tremendously.

Penrose proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference of space-time curvature attains a significant level.  Overview  Penrose's idea is inspired by quantum gravity, because it uses both the physical constants \\\\hbar and G. It is an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, which posits that superposition fails when an observation is made (but that it is non-objective in nature), and the many-worlds interpretation, which states that alternative outcomes of a superposition are equally \\"real\\", while their mutual decoherence precludes subsequent observable interactions. Penrose's idea is a type of objective collapse theory. For these theories, the wavefunction is a physical wave, which experiences wave function collapse as a physical process, with observers not having any special role. Penrose theorises that the wave function cannot be sustained in superposition beyond a certain energy difference between the quantum states. He gives an approximate value for this difference: a Planck mass worth of matter, which he calls the \\"'one-graviton' level\\". He then hypothesizes that this energy difference causes the wave function to collapse to a single state, with a probability based on its amplitude in the original wave function, a procedure derived from standard quantum mechanics. Penrose's \\"'one-graviton' level\\" criterion forms the basis of his prediction, providing an objective criterion for wave function collapse. Despite the difficulties of specifying this in a rigorous way, he proposes that the basis states into which the collapse takes place are mathematically described by the stationary solutions of the Schr√∂dinger‚ÄìNewton equation... Recent work indicates an increasingly deep inter-relation between quantum mechanics and gravitation.Leonard Susskind, Copenhagen vs Everett, Teleportation, and ER=EPR (2016) seminar notes, arXiv.  Physical consequences  Accepting that wavefunctions are physically real, Penrose believes that matter can exist in more than one place at one time. In his opinion, a macroscopic system, like a human being, cannot exist in more than one place for a measurable time, as the corresponding energy difference is very large. A microscopic system, like an electron, can exist in more than one location significantly longer (thousands of years), until its space-time curvature separation reaches collapse threshold.. > In Einstein's theory, any object that has mass causes a warp in the > structure of space and time around it. This warping produces the effect we > experience as gravity. Penrose points out that tiny objects, such as dust > specks, atoms and electrons, produce space-time warps as well. Ignoring > these warps is where most physicists go awry. If a dust speck is in two > locations at the same time, each one should create its own distortions in > space-time, yielding two superposed gravitational fields. According to > Penrose's theory, it takes energy to sustain these dual fields. The > stability of a system depends on the amount of energy involved: the higher > the energy required to sustain a system, the less stable it is. Over time, > an unstable system tends to settle back to its simplest, lowest-energy > state: in this case, one object in one location producing one gravitational > field. If Penrose is right, gravity yanks objects back into a single > location, without any need to invoke observers or parallel universes. Penrose speculates that the transition between macroscopic and quantum states begins at the scale of dust particles (the mass of which is close to a Planck mass). He has proposed an experiment to test this theory, called FELIX (free- orbit experiment with laser interferometry X-rays), in which an X-ray laser in space is directed toward a tiny mirror and fissioned by a beam splitter from tens of thousands of miles away, with which the photons are directed toward other mirrors and reflected back. One photon will strike the tiny mirror while moving to another mirror and move the tiny mirror back as it returns, and according to conventional quantum theories, the tiny mirror can exist in superposition for a significant period of time. This would prevent any photons from reaching the detector. If Penrose's hypothesis is correct, the mirror's superposition will collapse to one location in about a second, allowing half the photons to reach the detector.Folger, Tim. \\"If an Electron Can Be in 2 Places at Once, Why Can't You?\\" Discover. Vol. 25 No. 6 (June 2005). pp. 33‚Äì35. However, because this experiment would be difficult to arrange, a table-top version that uses optical cavities to trap the photons long enough for achieving the desired delay has been proposed instead.  Response  David Deutsch, from Oxford‚Äôs Centre for Quantum Computation, endorses the many-worlds interpretation. He dismisses Penrose's interpretation as \\"based more on aesthetics than science\\", as no experimental anomalies have been observed. However, Penrose has responded that if his prediction is true, no experiments have been performed at the particular \\"one-graviton\\" level, where quantum theory becomes overwhelmed by macroscopic effects.

After recording one track (\\"Africa\\") in London with engineer Dick Cuthell as a kind of a demo for label owner Chris Blackwell - its arrangement is completely different in comparison to the rest of the album and contains flute and chorus - Rodriguez was offered a contract to record this album; and he could arrange to record in Jamaica. After 15 years Rodriguez returned for the first time to Jamaica. He had left the country in 1961 when he was already heavily involved in creating the then new ska sound. In 1976 he added something new to reggae music. A critic wrote in 1977 that the album \\"does not just reflect the current popular trends, but ... expresses in a definitive way the Jamaican music tradition.\\" The nine self-composed tracks on the album offer Jamaican rhythms with horn lines between a melodic use (e.g. on \\"This Day\\", \\"Lumumba\\") and jazz; the latter helped to define something like a new genre, Jamaican jazz, transforming the experience from early ska days into 1970s roots reggae.

The St. Joseph Peninsula is located in Gulf County, Florida, in the Florida Panhandle, at coordinates . It is a 15-mile long spit, extending northward from Cape San Blas between the Gulf of Mexico to the west and St. Joseph Bay to the east. It is 6 miles west of Port St. Joe at its closest point. The peninsula is also known as St. Joseph Spit. The northern end of the peninsula is known as St. Joseph Point. History Evidence of the occupation of the St. Joseph Peninsula by Native Americans includes the Old Cedar site, the Eagle Harbor site and the Harrier site, occupied by people of Weeden Island culture. The Old Cedar and Eagle Harbor site also have artifacts from the Fort Walton culture, and the Eagle Harbor site has artifacts from the Swift Creek culture. The Spanish named the bay Bah√≠a de San Jos√© early in the 16th century, but did not occupy or exploit the area through the 17th century. In 1701 they built a fortification, the Presidio Bah√≠a de San Jos√© de Valladeres, on the mainland opposite St. Joseph Point, with a lookout post on the point, but left two years later. In 1718, during the War of the Quadruple Alliance, the French invaded St. Joseph Bay and established Fort Crevecouer on the shores of St. Joseph Bay opposite St. Joseph Point. The Spanish in turn sent 800 men to retake St. Joseph Bay. After pushing the French out of the area in 1719, the Presidio Bah√≠a de San Jos√© de Nueva Asturias was established on St. Joseph Point. With the loss of Pensacola to France that year, the new presidio was designated the capital of the newly created Province of the Principality of Nueva Asturias. The presidio, with about 2,000 inhabitants, lasted until 1722, when the post was moved to Presidio Isla Santa Rosa Punta de Siguenza near Pensacola on Santa Rosa Island. The St. Joseph Bay Light was established on St. Joseph Point in 1838 to serve the new town of St. Joseph on the eastern shore of the bay. The light was discontinued in 1847, after the town had been abandoned, and the unused tower was destroyed in a storm in 1851. Park T.H. Stone Memorial St. Joseph Peninsula State Park occupies somewhat more than half of the northern part of the peninsula. The peninsula was cut through by Hurricane Michael October 10, 2018 leaving the St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on an island.

On June, 2010, he was rearrested after he failed to leave East Jerusalem.Israel arrests Hamas official for failing to leave East Jerusalem Haaretz, 30 June 2010  Early life  Abu Tir was born in Umm Tuba, a present neighborhood in East Jerusalem. Abu Tir joined Fatah some time in the early 1970s. Around this time, he was convicted of terror-related activities in Israel and subsequently joined the Muslim Brotherhood.Profile of the Hamas movement Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies, 12 February 2006 He spent nearly 25 years in Israeli prisons, on and off, for directing terror activities against Israel, including the attempted poisoning in the early 1990s of Israel's water supplies and for directing the activities of Hamas's military arm, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades.Hamas's Tactics: Lessons from Recent Attacks In 2005, prior to the elections, he was released after serving a term of nearly seven years in prisons. After his release, he was recruited by Hamas to head its national list following its Gaza leader, Ismail Haniyeh. He was most recently arrested and later detained for campaigning near Jerusalem's Damascus Gate after violating a ban that forbade the practice. He was interrogated and later released. The incident transformed Tir into a minor celebrity among the public in his constituency. This incident, in the end, contributed positively to his overall campaign.  Political stance  As for his stance politically, he told Newsweek in 2006: \\"Stop your support for Israel...[s]top calling us terrorists. This policy creates a feeling of oppression. The feeling of oppression can lead to disaster.\\" Abu Tir: Jews Control Christianity WILLisms.com, 6 April 2006 Abu Tir recently told The Globe and Mail that his primary objective would be to \\"...take Sharia [Islamic law] as a source for legislation\\" but at the same time told Newsweek International he \\"...will [would] not [directly] impose Sharia.\\"Hamas official: Group will make Islamic law a source for legislation Haaretz, 29 January 2006Hamas' Leaders Council on Foreign Relations He also told The Globe and Mail that he plans to reform the Palestinian public education system by introducing a more Islamic curriculum, and also plans on separating male and female students. However Tir did clarify that alcohol would not be banned and it would not be mandatory for women to wear the hijab, or head-cover. Abu Tir also told the paper that as long as Israel continues its occupation of Palestinian land Hamas would continue its armed struggle against them. In an enigmatic statement in an interview prior to his getting elected, he stated that he would \\"negotiate [with Israel] better than the others [previous administrations], who negotiated for 10 years and achieved nothing.\\" He explained that \\"We [Hamas] are not against the Jews. We are against occupation and oppression\\".Can Militants Make Peace? Time He noted further that Hamas had removed significant sections of their constitution which called for Israel's destruction, though the basic idea remains the same: Israel cannot be allowed to remain as a Jewish state in the Middle East. \\"In the past,\\" he said, \\"it was said that we don't understand politics, only force, but we are a broad, well-grounded movement that is active in all areas of life. Now we are proving that we also understand politics better than the others.\\" Abu Tir's final thought on Israeli negotiation was to leave it to the new parliament \\"as with every matter, to be discussed and decided upon in a rational manner\\". After Hamas's landslide victory in January 2006 many countries decided to back Israel's decision to cut foreign aid to The Palestinian Authority. After being asked what Hamas planned to do in light of this Abu Tir stated that Hamas \\"would not go to foreign donors on [a] bended knee\\". In a 6 February 2006 open letter to Newsweek International Tir stated that \\"The European Union and America should cooperate with us. We have ways of creating understanding among our people. We are facilitators, helpers, aides. The presence of Hamas is a guarantee of safety and stability in the region. Any money that is given to us will be channelled to the correct path.\\"Open Letter: 'Just Be Fair With Us' Newsweek International, 2007 As he tried to address Western fears that donations would go to buy arms Tir told the West to \\"...[not] be afraid...we can always find arms on the black market. It is obvious that we have built our military infrastructure in that way. Our weapons are the only guarantee of our existence. If a proper Palestinian state were established, then all the militias would melt inside the Palestinian Army.\\" Summing up his letter Tir attempted to ease western anxiety about Hamas by stating that \\"The West has nothing to fear from Hamas. We're not going to force people to do anything. We will not impose Sharia. Hamas is contained. Hamas deals only with the Israeli occupation. We are not Al Qaeda.\\" 2006 and 2010 Arrests On 25 June 2006, Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was captured by Hamas, which touched off the 2006 Israel‚ÄìGaza conflict. A few days after the incident, on 29 June, Israel arrested 64 Hamas officials in the West Bank, including Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Abu Tir was among them and was held in jail for four years. Abu Tir was freed on 20 May 2010. He was subsequently stripped of his Israeli ID card and residency rights, and told by the Israeli Shin Bet intelligence service that he was banned from Jerusalem. He was held under administrative detention for one year and release in May 2012, expelled to Ramallah and not allowed to enter Jerusalem.Palestinians: Israel has released Muhammad Abu Tir  Orange beard  One of Abu Tir's most noticeable physical attributes and trademarks is his bright orange beard. The orange is actually a dyed substance called henna, a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically in order to maintain its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, there is no mention of a ban on the use of other colours. Residents in his native village of Umm Tuba say that his signature beard does help him stand out when he is out campaigning at public events and functions.

Integrated injection logic (IIL, I2L, or I2L) is a class of digital circuits built with multiple collector bipolar junction transistors (BJT). When introduced it had speed comparable to TTL yet was almost as low power as CMOS, making it ideal for use in VLSI (and larger) integrated circuits. The gates can be made smaller with this logic family than with CMOS because complementary transistors are not needed. Although the logic voltage levels are very close (High: 0.7V, Low: 0.2V), I2L has high noise immunity because it operates by current instead of voltage. I2L was developed in 1971 by Siegfried K. Wiedmann and Horst H. Berger who originally called it merged-transistor logic (MTL). A disadvantage of this logic family is that the gates draw power when not switching unlike with CMOS.  Construction  I2L NOR gate with two inputs, two outputs, and one voltage input for the current injector transistor The I2L inverter gate is constructed with a PNP common base current source transistor and an NPN common emitter open collector inverter transistor. On a wafer, these two transistors are merged together. A small voltage (around 0.6 volts) is supplied to the emitter of the current source transistor to control the current supplied to the inverter transistor. Transistors are used for current sources on integrated circuits because they are much smaller than resistors. Because the inverter is open collector, a wired AND operation may be performed by connecting an output from each of two or more gates together. Thus the fan-out of an output used in such a way is one. However, additional outputs may be produced by adding more collectors to the inverter transistor. The gates can be constructed very simply with just a single layer of interconnect metal. In a discrete implementation of an I2L circuit, bipolar NPN transistors with multiple collectors can be replaced with multiple discrete 3-terminal NPN transistors connected in parallel having their bases connected together and their emitters connected likewise. Similarly, the merged PNP current injector transistor and the NPN inverter transistor can be implemented as separate discrete components. The current source transistor may be replaced with a resistor from the positive supply to the base of the inverter transistor, since discrete resistors are smaller and less expensive than discrete transistors.  Operation  IIL circuit The heart of an I2L circuit is the common emitter open collector inverter. Typically, an inverter consists of an NPN transistor with the emitter connected to ground and the base biased with a forward current from the current source. The input is supplied to the base as either a current sink (low logic level) or as a high-z floating condition (high logic level). The output of an inverter is at the collector. Likewise, it is either a current sink (low logic level) or a high-z floating condition (high logic level). Like direct-coupled transistor logic, there is no resistor between the output (collector) of one NPN transistor and the input (base) of the following transistor. To understand how the inverter operates, it is necessary to understand the current flow. If the bias current is shunted to ground (low logic level), the transistor turns off and the collector floats (high logic level). If the bias current is not shunted to ground because the input is high-z (high logic level), the bias current flows through the transistor to the emitter, switching on the transistor, and allowing the collector to sink current (low logic level). Because the output of the inverter can sink current but cannot source current, it is safe to connect the outputs of multiple inverters together to form a wired AND gate. When the outputs of two inverters are wired together, the result is a two-input NOR gate because the configuration (NOT A) AND (NOT B) is equivalent to NOT (A OR B) (per De Morgan's Theorem). Due to internal parasitic capacitance in transistors, higher currents sourced into the base of the inverter transistor result in faster switching speeds, and since the voltage difference between high and low logic levels is smaller for I2L than other bipolar logic families (around 0.5 volts instead of around 3.3 or 5 volts), losses due to charging and discharging parasitic capacitances are minimized. Usage I2L is relatively simple to construct on an integrated circuit, and was commonly used before the advent of CMOS logic by companies such as Motorola (now Freescale) and Texas Instruments (e.g. SBP0400). In 1975, Sinclair Radionics introduced one of the first consumer-grade digital watches, the Black Watch, which used I2L technology. In the late 1970s, RCA used I¬≤L in its CA3162 ADC 3 digit meter integrated circuit. In 1979, HP introduced a frequency measurement instrument based on a HP-made custom LSI chip that uses integrated injection logic (I2L) for low power consumption and high density, enabling portable battery operation, and also some emitter function logic (EFL) circuits where high speed is needed in its HP 5315A/B. \\"HP memory project: Time, Frequency Standard & Counter\\" References Further reading  * Category:Logic families ","title":"Integrated injection logic"},{"id":"4111008","text":"Oleksandr Yevhenovych Rybka (; born 10 April 1987 in Kyiv) is a Ukrainian football goalkeeper who last plays for FK LiepƒÅja in the Latvian Higher League.

Helfenstein Castle represents the remnants of the fortified castle (burg) Helfenstein of the counts of Helfenstein located above the city of Geislingen an der Steige, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. History Ruins of Castle Helfenstein The castle was constructed, by Eberhard von Helfenstein, at the turn of the 12th century and was frequently enlarged during the period from 1100 to 1380. The site of the castle, over the main Imperial road through the Fils valley, allowed the Helfensteins to observe and control trade in the region. The close connection between the Helfensteins and the Hohenstaufen Emperors during the 12th and 13th Centuries allowed the family to grow and expand. During the peak of their power the Helfenstein family ruled Heidenheim, Blaubeuren, Wiesensteig and Sigmaringen. However, as the Hohenstaufen family lost power so did the Helfensteins. By 1382 the castle was used as collateral for a loan from the city of Ulm. Then in 1396 the castle was totally under the control of the free and imperial city of Ulm. As gunpowder weapons became more common, the castle was expanded and rebuilt as a fortress. On the top of the hill, in the direction of Weiler, a bulwark was built to protect the castle. The old keep was rebuilt with extensive walls. Additionally, the terraces below the castle were expanded and fortified. The castle was used for the Ulm representative or Vogt and the western section of the castle was rebuilt as proper home for a patrician Vogt. In 1552, during the Second Margrave War the castle fell unopposed into the hands of the Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. In August that year, troops from Ulm retook the castle after several days of shelling with heavy stone cannonballs. Having lost its significance and value as a fortification, the city of Ulm started to demolish the castle starting in 1552, sending all usable materials to Ulm. The ruins were left and the site became overgrown over the following centuries. Starting in 1932, the site of Helfenstein Castle was excavated with the help of Army engineer troops. A south tower was rebuilt and stairs and wooden bridges were erected to allow easy access from several directions. The ruined complex is a favorite destination for weekend walks and excursions.

History Born in Utrecht, Netherlands, Van der Capellen was the son of a cavalry colonel Alexander Philip van der Capellen. In 1803, he married Jacoba Elisabeth van Tuyll van Serooskerken. He was made Prefect of Friesland in 1808 and soon thereafter Minister of the Interior and a member of the Privy Council. At his advice, King Louis Napoleon abdicated the throne in 1810 in favor of his son, Louis II. Van der Capellen did not serve Napoleon I. Wilhelm I, King of the Netherlands, appointed him Colonial Minister and sent him as Secretary of United Kingdom of the Netherlands to Brussels. In 1815, Van der Capellen was made one of the three Commissioners-General of the Dutch East Indies with Cornelis Theodorus Elout and Arnold Adriaan Buyskes, where he had to deal with both a native rebellion and a money shortage. In fact, during his tenure in Java, his power was largely ceremonial as his adjunct, Cornelis Theodorus Elout, had much of the actual power. The King decreed freedom of cultivation and trade, and the slave trade was prohibited. As Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Van der Capellen was less progressive than other commissioners; after they left in 1819, he increased the power of native chiefs. He protected the Government's system of coffee plantations by not allowing European planters to settle in the Priangan area of West Java, nor would he let Europeans or Chinese trade there. On 28 April 1822, he was made a Baron. In 1824 he cancelled contracts of land tenancy, forcing the native chiefs to pay back the advances they had received by further exploiting the cultivators. This caused unrest in Yogyakarta. As the post-war boom in coffee and sugar exports faded, Javanese ports went into deficit. Money was spent quelling riots outside of Java in Maluku (Moluccas), Kalimantan (Borneo), Sulawesi (Celebes), Palembang, and on the west coast of Sumatra. Van der Capellen made a tour in 1824 and abolished the hated limit on the number of spice trees. Muntinghe's proposal for a national company under King Willem was adopted in 1825 as the Netherlands Trading Society with 37,000,000 guilders in capital and paying 4.5 percent dividends. Hard-pressed cultivators had to pay taxes in money and turned to Chinese moneylenders.Indonesia and the Dutch 1800-1950, san.beck.org He was ordered back in 1825 and named President of the Board of Trustees of the University of Utrecht in 1828. In 1838, he attended the coronation of Queen Victoria in London as the Dutch envoy. Van der Capellen then served as the Lord Chamberlain of King William II. He died in April 1848 in De Bilt.

It is set in post-World War II Japan and is narrated by Masuji Ono, an ageing painter, who looks back on his life and how he has lived it. He notices how his once great reputation has faltered since the war and how attitudes towards him and his paintings have changed. The chief conflict deals with Ono's need to accept responsibility for his past actions and in the expostulation to find a path to peace in his good will for the young white collar workers on the streets at lunchbreak. The novel also deals with the role of people in a rapidly changing environment and with the assuming of guilt. The novel falls under both historical fiction and global literature (Weltliteratur).Erich Auerbach, Maire Said, Edward Said, Philology and ‚ÄúWeltliteratur, Vol. 13, No.1 (Michigan: Michigan State University Press, 1969), pp. 1-17, JSTOR It is known as historical fiction due to its basis on remembering the past and it draws from historical facts. It is also known as global literature as it has a broad international market and allows for a study on how the world today is interconnected.  Publication history  Originally published in 1986, it was named the Whitbread Book of the Year Award and shortlisted for the Booker Prize. Published by Faber and Faber it is also printed by publishing companies such as Allen and Unwin and Penguin Vintage International. It has become an eBook version additionally and is available on most eBook websites such as kindle and iBook‚Äôs, since 2012. Currently, An Artist of the Floating World, has been translated into over 40 languages around the world.  Autobiographical elements  Kazuo Ishiguro was born in Nagasaki, Japan in 1954, eventually moving to England at the age of five, only to return to Japan twenty-nine years later. Growing up Ishiguro had a traditionally Japanese mother, who resultantly influenced his writing when reflecting on Japan. Furthermore, his reading of Japanese novels and comics allowed him to stay connected to his Japanese heritage as well as see the differences between Western and Japanese society, influencing his writing through developing a sense of Japanese ideals. The inclusion of Ichiro‚Äôs cowboy obsession stemmed from Ishiguro‚Äôs own fascination with cowboys during his youth. Ishiguro was inspired to write An Artist of the Floating World, due to his original novel A Pale View of Hills, which included an old teacher character, that has to rediscover and invent his own morals. This reflects his own consistent rediscovery and invention of himself throughout his youth and adult years. Furthermore, owing to his childhood of moving countries and subsequently not feeling like he ‚Äòfit-in‚Äô he wrote in a very globalised and international way; through writing Ishiguro explored his background and heritage. The novel overall, is a reflection of Ishiguro's personal feelings of Japanese heritage, a fictional reflection of his sense of identity, as presented through a youthful reconstruction of Japan. Title The novel's title is based on the literal translation of Ukiyo-e, a word referring to the Japanese art of prints. Therefore, it can be read as \\"a printmaker\\" or \\"an artist living in a changing world,\\" given both Ono's limited understanding and the dramatic changes his world, Japan in the first half of the twentieth century, has undergone in his lifetime. The title also refers to an artistic genre. Ono's master was especially interested in depicting scenes from the pleasure district adjacent to the villa in which he and his students lived. Ono mentions the ephemeral nature of the floating world that could be experienced during each night. His master experimented with innovative softer Western-style painting techniques. Ono became estranged from him and forged his own career. He could not help but feel gleeful when his master's paintings fell into disfavour during a return to the use of more traditional bold lines in the paintings used for nationalistic posters.  Structure  An Artist of the Floating World, is structured through the interwoven memories of protagonist Masuji Ono. The novel is set in three distinctly different years however, Ono's memories span as far back to when he was a child. The four different years and title sections of the novel are: October 1948, April 1949, November 1949 and June 1950. Plot summary  In the buildup to World War II, Ono, a promising artist, had broken away from the teaching of his master, whose artistic aim was to reach an aesthetic ideal, and had gotten involved in far-right politics, making propagandistic art. As a member of the Cultural Committee of the Interior Department and official adviser to the Committee of Unpatriotic Activities, Ono had become a police informer, taking an active part in an ideological witch hunt. After the 1945 defeat and the collapse of jingoistic Imperial Japan, Ono has become a discredited figure, one of the \\"traitors\\" who \\"led the country astray\\"; meanwhile, the victims of state repression, including people Ono himself had denounced, are reinstated and allowed to lead a normal life. Over the course of the first three sections, spanning October 1948 ‚Äì November 1949, Ono seems to show a growing acknowledgement of his past \\"errors\\", although this acknowledgement is never explicitly stated. However, in the short fourth and last section (June 1950), Ono appears to have returned to his earlier inability to change his viewpoint. The book is written in the first person and hinges on the exclusive use of a single, unreliable narrator, expressing a viewpoint which the reader identifies as limited and fallible, without any other voice or point of view acting as a test. Ono often makes it clear that he is not sure of the accuracy of his narrative, but this may either make the reader cautious or, on the contrary, suggest that Ono is very honest and, therefore, trustworthy. The self-image Ono expresses in his narrative is vastly different from the image of him the reader builds from reading the same narrative. Ono often quotes others as expressing admiration and indebtedness to him. Ono's narrative is characterised by denial, so that his interests and his hierarchy of values are at odds with the reader's. Readers, therefore, find that what they are interested in is not the focus of Ono's narrative but at its fringes, presented in an oblique rather than direct fashion. For example, Ono's descriptions of his pictures focus on pictorial technique, mentioning the subjects as if they were unimportant, although they reveal the propagandistic nature of his work. It is not entirely clear whether this focus on style rather than substance should be ascribed to Ono as narrator (showing his retrospective, unconscious embarrassment), or if it was already present in him at the time he was making the pictures (showing that totalitarianism exploits people's capacity to restrain their awareness to limited aspects of their actions). Similarly, when Ono narrates an episode in which he was confronted with the results of his activities as a police informer, it is debatable whether his attempt to mitigate the brutality of the police is a retrospective fabrication devised to avoid his own responsibility, or whether he actually did disapprove of the treatment of the person he had denounced, distancing himself from his actions and refusing to recognise the abusive treatment as a direct and foreseeable consequence of those actions.  Characters = Masuji Ono  Masuji Ono (Â∞èÈáé ÁõäÊ¨° Ono Masuji) is the narrator and protagonist of the novel. He is presented as an elderly artist, father and grandfather to his family. Throughout the novel he is concerned with his youngest daughter's marriage negotiations. As a child his father was reluctant for him to become a painter, however as he grew older he soon became an artist. He previously worked in his younger years with the nationalist government in the creation of wartime paintings. Presently, whilst his art career before his involvement with propaganda paintings is applauded, his other work is scorned. This results in Ono living a conflicting life.  Noriko  Noriko is Ono's youngest daughter. She lives with him in his house and is seen as sometimes indignant and bad-mannered. She is somewhat bitter to Ono in the beginning of the novel as she believes he was the core reason as to why her original marriage arrangement was cancelled. However, she soon become enamoured with her second marriage arrangement and is happy when she eventually marries him. Noriko views her father, Ono, as someone she must care for forming a small resentment and anger towards him. Noriko is very outspoken and boisterous throughout the novel, contrasting Setsuko.  Setsuko  Setsuko is Ono's eldest daughter. She is a quiet and traditional woman, who is married to Suichi and has a son named Ichiro. She and Ono have a solid relationship and she helps him throughout the marriage arrangement proceedings and dealing with his guilt post-war; she acts as his listener. Setsuko and Noriko have a strong, sisterly relationship, however they are quite different temperament wise.  Ichiro  Ichiro is Ono's grandson, Setsuko's child and Noriko's nephew. He is a young boy in the novel with an active imagination. To Ono, Ichiro can be confusing and alienating owing to his adoption of Western culture such as some English words and his obsession with cowboys and the movie Godzilla. They have a good relationship, and bond over their masculinity frequently.  Suichi  Suichi is Setsuko's husband and son-in-law to Ono. He represents the new and changing ideals of Japan and is quite outspoken regarding Ono's role in the war. He frequently speaks out about his opinions regarding the war. Before the war he was seen as a well-mannered and happy man, however post-war he has seen to have changed into a relatively angry and bitter man as a result of his experiences as a soldier.  Kuroda  Kuroda was Ono's prot√©g√© and student. They initially had a strong relationship, but after Ono disapproved of the direction of Kuroda's art he reported Kuroda to the Committee of Unpatriotic Activities. This results in Kuroda being punished and his paintings destroyed. He therefore develops a strong dislike for Ono, and never sees him again.  Chishi Matsuda  Matsuda is characterised as a nationalist who ultimately influences Ono, to create politicised paintings. He disparages artists who do not deal with social and political issues through their art, considering them to be na√Øve. After the war, he becomes a sick and elderly individual who Ono visits relatively frequently. He is quite regretful of remaining unmarried and having no heirs to succeed him.  Seiji Moriyama  Seiji Moriyama, also known as Mori-san during the novel, was Ono's art teacher during his younger years. He is a strong believer in painting the ‚Äòfloating world‚Äô and teaches students in his villa. His main artistic technique is the inclusion of Western techniques such using dark lines in favour of shading. He is a stubborn yet nurturing figure, however once students steer away from his techniques, they are soon told to leave.  Dr. Saito  Dr Saito is a major art professor with a high social standing. Ono believes he is well acquainted with his work, however Setsuko disagrees throughout the novel, raising questions as to the validity of his memory.  Mrs. Kawakami  Mrs. Kawakami is the bar owner of which Ono frequent regularly, in the pleasure district of where he lives. She is a good friend of Ono. She remains hopeful throughout the novel that the pleasure district will have a resurrection, however this is not the case and she thus sells her bar by the end.  Yasunari Nakahara  Nakahara, also referred to as ‚ÄòThe Tortoise‚Äô due to his slow painting, is a friend of Ono's during his youthful days at Mori-san's villa. He is mocked by many of Mori-san's pupils for his slow painting however Ono soon defends him. However, after Ono alters his painting style to become politically associated he distances himself, believing Ono has become a traitor. Themes An Artist of the Floating World discusses several themes through the memories of the narrator, Masuji Ono. The analysis of these themes is facilitated through the transcendence of time, allowing the audience's rumination on Ono's experiences permitting them to judge the narrative objectively. Many of these themes are interwoven together supporting one another. Among the themes explored in this novel are arranged marriage, the changing roles of women, and the declining status of \\"elders\\" in Japanese society since 1945. The novel is narrated by a man who, besides being an artist, is also a father, a grandfather, and a widower. It tells, with a strong voice, much about the \\"pleasure era\\" of Japanese society, elaborating on the life of a successful and devoted young artist in a decadent era. The reader learns how attitudes toward Japanese art and society became less tolerant of such extravagance, and what it was like to live with the guilt of such pleasure. The pace is slow and lingers over details, reflecting the central theme.  Politicisation of art  Art is a central theme to the novel, with Ono's role as a propaganda artist the chief story line. Art facilitates the questioning of its ability to influence and inspire action within a community. There is a large conflict between whether art should be politicised or whether it should be simply a source of gratification. Ishiguro both highlights the role of politicised art to be seen as detrimental to society through the impacts of the war, and to be seen as ineffectual and unsubstantial to changing events; the war and its subsequent effect would have occurred with Ono's propaganda, or without it. This theme bleeds into the scene regarding Kuroda and Ono, ultimately suggesting that the politicisation of art will result in the manufacturing of cruel actions. However, this idea is counteracted through the various scenes between Ono and his daughters who confront the idea of his role as a propagandist being highly involved. This allows both sides of arts argument to be explored facilitating the questioning of arts role. Art is therefore transcended into a defining moment of Japanese history, pre and post war life.  Unreliable narrator  The novel is structured as a series of interwoven memories described by Masuji Ono. Ishiguro uses a variety of techniques to convey the fallibility of Ono's recollections to the audience, gradually revealing that Ono is an unreliable narrator and undermining the audience's faith in his story. For example, Ono makes frequent digressions into explanation unrelated topics and events during his narration, downplaying and concealing his cruel actions and misleading the audience as to the significance of unimportant topics. When Ono recounts interactions with family members, events are often referred to indirectly, or with incomplete information, disguising the truth of what has occurred. Because they are given incomplete and confusing information, it becomes more difficult for the audience to determine the extent of Ono's actions and the responsibility he bears for them. Masuji Ono repeatedly reassesses events from his past throughout the novel, which suggests that he is constantly reconsidering his guilt about his actions and ultimately rethinking both the role of propaganda and the construction of memories. This process of reassessment highlights his status as an unreliable narrator, emphasising his fickle nature. This reflects the concept that memory is processed through an individual's consciousness, making it subjective to that particular person.  Responsibility  Similar to the theme of the politicisation of art, Ishiguro explores the role of responsibility through the narration of, Masuji Ono. This is identified through the conflict between actions and culpability that is created through Ono's inability to take responsibility. This is evident through his attempt at masking his actions and the subsequent consequences. An Artist of the Floating World explores the liability of leaders after the war and how many of them were not held responsible. Alternatively, the concept of responsibility can be considered abstractly. This is done by placing emphasis on the reader to take responsibility in the determining the ending of the novel; is Ono guilty of his actions or is he simply exaggerating his importance and role in the war.  Changing values  Post-World War II Japan was a time of great change and upheaval of traditional values. Japan's defeat in the war created a large divide between individuals and generations. In the novel, this clash of values is represented in the relationship between Masuji Ono and his grandson Ichiro. Ono represents the traditional values of pre-war Japan, while Ichiro represents post-war Japan and the new generation. Major changes explored include the changing attitudes towards the war, family hierarchy, geography of Japan and the increasing prevalence of Western culture. This is presented through scenes such as between Ichiro and Ono when watching the Godzilla movie, Ichiro's obsession with cowboys and his lack of interest in Japanese heroes. Ishiguro does not present these changes as either good or bad, instead simply portrays them as reality, allowing the audience to determine their effects on society. Women are portrayed throughout this novel through both the perspective of Ono and the perspective of the changing Japanese society. The concept of Japanese masculinity altered after Japan's defeat in the war, and whilst changes were made to the role of women, women's stereotypes were not changed drastically. This is explored throughout the novel through Noriko's quest for a husband. Marriage negotiations are the central tenet to this novel. Through the marriage negotiations Ono reflects on his past facilitating the creation of the story. Overall, the marriage negotiations are the stimulus for Ono to reflect on his past memories. They further facilitate him taking responsibility for his actions as well as allow him to reconsider the changing values of Japan as perhaps positive. They allow for him to admit his mistakes, progressing the narrative and acting as a literary device.  Literary significance  Iain Maloney listed An Artist of the Floating World as an essential novel for Japanophiles. Robert McCrum ranked it the 94th greatest novel ever written. The novel was shortlisted for the 1986 Booker Prize and won the Whitbread Book of the Year Award for the same year. It was a nominee for ALA best books for young adults. The Nobel Foundation, which awarded Ishiguro the 2017 Nobel Prize in Literature, noted in its biography of the author that An Artist of the Floating World was the work that made him \\"a highly visible young writer.\\" References External links  *Random House webpage Category:1986 British novels Category:Costa Book Award-winning works Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture Category:Ukiyo-e Category:Novels by Kazuo Ishiguro Category:Novels about artists Category:Novels set in Japan Category:Faber and Faber books ","title":"An Artist of the Floating World"},{"id":"4111133","text":"The Lotus Mark VI is the first production car by Lotus Cars. It was introduced by Colin Chapman in 1952 after previously building multiple trials and road racing cars. The heart of the Mark VI is a space frame chassis. Rather than a complete car, it was available to the general public as kit, wherein the customer could install any preferred engine and gearbox, making it eligible for a wider number of formulae. Design The Mark VI in many ways reflected Chapman's background in engineering: his designs resulted from a stress analysis of loads into the frame, they were extremely light (the 6' space frame weighed only 55 lbs (25 kg)), and the suspension incorporated the latest advances. The prototype chassis was built up by the Progress Chassis Company and the aluminium body was constructed by panel beaters Williams and Prichard. (Both firms would later furnish bodies and chassis for subsequent models.) The cheap and easily available mechanical parts were sourced from the Ford Prefect. The Mark VI became a popular sight on Britain's racetracks, and was a frequent winner, beating many more powerful and expensive cars, earning praise for very good handling and superior low-speed acceleration.Setright, L.J.K, \\"Lotus: The golden mean\\", in Northey, Tom, ed. World of Automobiles (London: Orbis, 1974), Volume 11, p.1223. An important facet of the success of the kit was Chapman's offering a comprehensive package in the Mark VI, including most of the special parts needed, and not just the chassis. The Mark VI chassis came with mounting points for several different engines including the 1172 cc (71.5ci) Ford 10, the 1250 cc or 1500 cc MG TF, the 1500 cc (92 ci) Consul, and the exalted Coventry Climax. Standardized as far as possible for volume production, some units were customized per the owners wishes. Lotus even modified the owner's parts, if needed. The success of the Mark VI in competition and sales (100 built by 1955Setright, p.1223.) established Chapman as a manufacturer of specialty cars.

It features songs that were written by the Sherman Brothers, with music arrangements by Tutti Camarata. The Shermans also co- wrote the screenplay but are not credited for this. Host Ludwig Von Drake invites his audience into his mansion where he tells all about popular music through the years, introducing several songs illustrated with stop-motion photography. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. It was released on DVD in 2005 as part of the Walt Disney Treasures set Disney Rarities. Songs=The Rutabaga Rag \\"The Rutabaga Rag\\", performed by Paul Frees as Ludwig Von Drake, was not written as a parody of ragtime, but rather as an authentic ragtime song.Disney Rarities - Audio Commentary for A Symposium on Popular Songs with Leonard Maltin and Richard M. Sherman, 2005 In the course of the film's narration, Von Drake claims to have invented ragtime music and, specifically, this song. During the song, a variety of stop-motion animated vegetables with faces appear and dance to the song. Charleston Charlie \\"Charleston Charlie\\", performed by Betty Boopie Doop (Gloria Wood), makes direct reference to the singing style exemplified by Helen Kane in her flapper era iconic song \\"He's So Unusual\\", which was co- written by the Sherman Brothers' Tin Pan Alley songwriting father, Al Sherman in 1929 (see 1929 in music). The subject of both songs is a male college student whom the singer desires. \\"Charleston Charlie\\" begins with the Betty Boop-esque lyric \\"Boop boop be doop\\". In the film, Ludwig Von Drake claims he wrote the song when traveling below the Mason‚ÄìDixon line. \\"Mr. Dixon\\" approached Drake and asked him to put \\"Dixie\\" on the map. For this reason, he wrote a song originally entitled, \\"Louisville Ludwig\\", but later changed the name to \\"Charleston Charlie\\" in order to protect the innocent, namely himself. Although I Dropped $100,000 Also known as \\"Although I Dropped a Hundred Thousand in the Market, Baby (I Found a Million Dollars in Your Smile)\\", and performed by Rah, Rah Rudy (Frees) and his Megaphone Boys, this song makes a subtle reference to the singing style exemplified by Ted Lewis in \\"Wear a Hat with a Silver Lining\\" which was co-written by the Sherman Brothers' father, Al Sherman. Throughout the spoken middle part of the song, reference is made to numerous Depression era songs including the iconic Al Sherman/Al Lewis classic \\"Now's the Time to Fall in Love\\", \\"Let a Smile Be Your Umbrella\\", and \\"Stormy Weather\\".Sherman, Robert B. Walt's Time: from before to beyond. Chapter 1; \\"Al's Time\\", Pages 17, 231. Santa Clarita: Camphor Tree Publishers, 1998 According to film critic, Leonard Maltin, this song as well as \\"Charleston Charlie\\" are homages to Al Sherman and his songs. In the context of the film, Ludwig Von Drake claims he wrote the song and it became all the rage at the beginning of the Great Depression. I'm Blue for You, Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo \\"I'm Blue for You, Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo-Boo\\", performed by Fosby Crooner (Skip Farrell), is a tribute to Bing Crosby's signature crooning style. Crooning elements, such as the repetition of \\"Boo boo boo boo boo\\", the whistling of the melody, and over-rhyming of the word \\"heart\\", are placed throughout the song. Crosby worked with Disney before in \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\" from The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad. The Sherman Brothers' father, Al Sherman, wrote several songs which were sung by Bing Crosby in the 1930s and 1940s. In 1970, Robert and Richard Sherman had a chance, in their own right, to work with the legendary Crosby on the made-for-television musical production of Goldilocks. The Boogie Woogie Bakery Man \\"The Boogie Woogie Bakery Man\\", performed by the Sister Sisters (Betty Allan, Diane Pendleton and Gloria Wood), had a structure and arrangement closely styled after The Andrews Sisters' hit song, \\"Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy\\". The song makes direct and indirect references to the singing style exemplified by the Andrews Sisters, as well as numerous songs from the swing era which was the heyday of their career. The very first line of the song references several swing era songs: The song itself is about an \\"oriental\\" baker of fortune cookies. At the time, the song was written, the use of the term \\"oriental\\" was quite common. However, in recent decades, the term has increasingly been seen to be offensive when used to describe an individual from the far east. The Andrews Sisters worked with Disney before in \\"Johnnie Fedora and Alice Bluebonnet\\" from Make Mine Music and \\"Little Toot\\" from Melody Time. In 1974, twelve years after A Symposium on Popular Songs was first released, the Sherman Brothers worked with the Andrews Sisters on the Tony Award winning show, Over Here!, which was also an homage to the 1940s swing era music of the day. Puppy Love Is Here to Stay \\"Puppy Love Is Here to Stay\\", performed by Jackie Babalon (Billy Storm) and the Babaloonians, is the penultimate song in the film. With the exception of the \\"harder-edged\\" \\"Rock, Rumble and Roar\\", it is meant to represent relatively modern music. Although the Sherman Brothers made their name on writing songs much like this one, this song is different in that it partially parodies songs like it, exploring the perceived innocence of Eisenhower's 1950s America. There are references to songs such as \\"Blue Moon\\" by The Marcels and Annette Funicello's version of \\"Puppy Love\\". Rock, Rumble and Roar \\"Rock, Rumble and Roar\\" is the final song from the film and sung by Paul Frees, Gloria Wood, Skip Farrell, Betty Allan, and Diane Pendleton. The song is meant to be the most modern of the songs from the film, and also revisits the six previous songs. This song is a homage to the popular, early rock and roll song, \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\". It is the second song in the featurette to be sung by Ludwig Von Drake.

Lehman notes that this film illustrates music history through use of humor, following a formula that the Disney studio had previously used in Toot, Whistle, Plunk and Boom (1953). In this case Ludwig Von Drake plays the songs which he supposedly helped popularize, covering musical styles from the 1900s decade to the 1960s.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Certain segments of the film use stop motion animation. The technique was unusual for a Disney film, but did nor mark the first time the studio used it in a film. It had earlier been used in Noah's Ark (1959), a well-received animated short. Noah's Ark had actually been nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Lehman finds it remarkable for the time of the film's release, that A Symposium recognizes African-American music as part of American musical history in the 20th century. Though he notes that African Americans as an ethnic group are not mentioned in the film, several of the musical styles used have their roots in musical styles developed by Black people.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 One of the earliest famous songs introduced by Ludwig in the film is a ragtime piece. A genre which Lehman notes was pioneered by African-American composer Scott Joplin.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Among the last and most modern songs showcased in the film are a couple of rock and roll numbers, a music genre which has its roots in the African-American rhythm and blues. Lehman points that in the years preceding the release, rock and roll and its African-American roots were still controversial. The music genre had been derisively described as \\"nigger music\\".Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Yet here, not only does Ludwig showcase rock and roll songs. He plays guitar and sings a rock song for the conclusion. An innovative move, since no theatrical star of the time had actually performed as a rock singer.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Lehman finds the film to be part of a trend in the Disney animated studio of using more sympathetic portrayals of African Americans, Africans, and African-American music over time. During World War II, Disney animated shorts seemed to associate musicians wearing zoot suit and boogie-woogie , an ancestor of rock and roll, with threatening forces and the Axis powers themselves.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Disney had a long history of portraying animated black characters as buffoons and/or servants. He cites as a late example the portrayal of indigenous Africans in Social Lion (1954). They were depicted as \\"sleepy-eyed\\" people, wearing grass skirts, and employed as servants of White hunters.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 A few years later, in Paul Bunyan (1958), Disney gave a more sympathetic portrayal of a black character. In a brief tribute to other American folk heroes besides Paul Bunyan himself, the film depicted among them a black man: John Henry. The Disney staff gave Henry a muscular physique and treated him as a hero. Though Lehman notes that the film never depicted Henry's face, which was hidden between his arms.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Disney was apparently becoming more progressive with time and breaking with the traditions of stereotypical portrayal of blacks in animation.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 Lehman notes that Disney's newfound ethnic sensitivity, when it came to African American culture, did not extend to the portrayal of Asian Americans. The stop-motion scenes of A Symposium included a single Asian character: a crudely constructed puppet with slanty eyes.Lehman (2007), p. 28-29 See also * List of American films of 1962 Sources * ReferencesExternal links *A Symposium On Popular Songs at The Encyclopedia of Disney Animated Shorts * Category:1962 films Category:1962 animated films Category:1960s educational films Category:1962 musical films Category:American films Category:Animated musical films Category:Disney animated short films, 1960s Category:Disney educational films Category:Documentary films about music and musicians Category:English-language films Category:Films about music and musicians Category:Films directed by Bill Justice Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films using stop-motion animation Category:Musicals by the Sherman Brothers ","title":"A Symposium on Popular Songs"},{"id":"4111254","text":"Detail of a building along Reclamation Street.

Synopsis The novel recounts the story of self-absorbed Sir Willoughby Patterne and his attempts at marriage; jilted by his first bride-to-be, he vacillates between the sentimental Laetitia Dale and the strong-willed Clara Middleton. More importantly, the novel follows Clara's attempts to escape from her engagement to Sir Willoughby, who desires women to serve as a mirror for him and consequently cannot understand why she would not want to marry him. Thus, The Egoist dramatises the difficulty contingent upon being a woman in Victorian society, when women's bodies and minds are trafficked between fathers and husbands to cement male bonds. Critical response In an afterword by Angus Wilson, The Egoist was called \\"the turning point in George Meredith's career.\\" Wilson saw Meredith as \\"the first great art novelist\\"; his afterword interprets the book as an adaptation of a stage comedy, an achievement he arrogates to few English authors, who, he suggests, present only \\"farce or satire.\\" He compliments Meredith most when he is detached from his characters, as \\"it is then that our laughter is most thoughtful.\\" Wilson is most taken by \\"the absolute truth of much of the dialogue,\\" such as how \\"the way Sir Willoughby continues to speak through the answers of other characters, returning to notice their replies only when his own vein of thought is exhausted\\" is a \\"wonderful observation of human speech.\\" In his essay \\"Books Which Have Influenced Me,\\" Robert Louis Stevenson reports the following story: \\"A young friend of Mr. Meredith's (as I have the story) came to him in agony. 'This is too bad of you,' he cried. 'Willoughby is me!' 'No, my dear fellow,' said the author; 'he is all of us.'\\" E. M. Forster discussed the book in his lecture series Aspects of the Novel, using it as an example of a \\"highly organised\\" plot. Much of his discussion, however, focuses on Meredith and his popularity as an author. More materially, Forster compliments Meredith on not revealing Laetitia Dale's changed feelings for Willoughby until she rejects him in their midnight meeting; \\"[i]t would have spoiled his high comedy if we had been kept in touch throughout ... in fact it would be boorish. ... Meredith with his unerring good sense here lets the plot triumph\\" rather than explaining Dale's character more fully. Forster further compares Meredith with Thomas Hardy, complimenting Hardy on his pastoral sensibilities and Meredith on his powerful plots, \\"[knowing] what [his] novel[s] could stand.\\"  References External links * Free MP3 audiobook of The Egoist from LibriVox Sources  Category:1879 British novels Category:English novels Category:Victorian novels Category:Novels by George Meredith ","title":"The Egoist (novel)"},{"id":"4111293","text":"The lingual nerve provides sensory (touch, pain and temperature) innervation to the anterior two thirds of the tongue. It is made of fibres from both the mandibular division of the trigeminal nerve (CN V3) and from the facial nerve (CN VII). The fibres from the mandibular nerve are for touch, and the ones from the facial nerve are for taste. Structure The lingual nerve lies at first beneath the lateral pterygoid muscle, medial to and in front of the inferior alveolar nerve, and is occasionally joined to this nerve by a branch which may cross the internal maxillary artery. The chorda tympani (a branch of the facial nerve, CN VII) joins it at an acute angle here, carrying taste fibers from the anterior two thirds of the tongue and parasympathetic fibers to the submandibular ganglion. The nerve then passes between the medial pterygoid muscle and the ramus of the mandible, and crosses obliquely to the side of the tongue beneath the constrictor pharyngis superior and styloglossus, and then between the hyoglossus and deep part of the submandibular gland; it finally runs from laterally to medially inferiorly crossing the duct of the submandibular gland, and along the tongue to its tip becoming the sublingual nerve, lying immediately beneath the mucous membrane. A well known rhyme has been used by anatomy students for many years to remember some features of the lingual nerve anatomy mentioned above: \\"The Lingual Nerve, Describes a Curve, Across the Hyoglossus... Function The lingual nerve supplies general somatic afferent innervation from the mucous membrane of the anterior two-thirds (body) of the tongue, while the posterior one-third (root) is innervated by the glossopharyngeal. It also carries nerve fibers that are not part of the trigeminal nerve, including the chorda tympani nerve of the facial nerve, which provides special sensation (taste) to the anterior 2/3 part of the tongue as well as parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers. The submandibular ganglion is suspended by two nerve filaments from the lingual nerve. Clinical significance=Lingual nerve injuries The most common cause of lingual nerve injuries is third molar (wisdom tooth) surgery, less commonly the lingual nerve can be injured by local anaesthetic dental injections (particularly inferior dental block injections) and sublingual or submandibular surgery.Br Dent J. 2013 Oct;215(8):393-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bdj.2013.993. Any injury to sensory nerves can result in pain, altered sensation and/or numbness, but usually a combination of all three symptoms arises. This can have a significant negative effect on the patient's quality of life affecting their daily function and psychological health.http://www.quintpub.com/userhome/jop/jop_25_4_Renton_7.pdf Patients should be routinely warned about lingual nerve injuries prior to wisdom tooth and floor of mouth surgery. The risk associated with wisdom tooth surgery is commonly accepted to be 2% temporary and 0.2% permanent. Warning patients of nerve injury prior to administration of deep dental injections has a risk of injury in approximately 1:14,000 with 25% of these remaining persistent. Preoperative warning about these injuries is routinely undertaken in the US and Germany. This reflects good practice recommended by the Royal College of Anaesthetists (prior warning of potential nerve injury in relation to spinal and epidural blocks 1 on 24-57,000 risk) and NHS patient.uk.com.

She won an Olympic gold medal in the snowboard cross event at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, to become the first Canadian woman to win a gold medal on home soil at the Olympics. She is also the 2013 World Champion and two-time Winter X Games Champion (1999, 2006). Career Ricker was born in North Vancouver, British Columbia, and resides in Squamish, British Columbia. As a young girl Ricker had two dreams: to compete competitively in snowboarding, and to compete in snowboarding at the Winter Olympics, despite the fact that Snowboarding was not an Olympic sport at the time. She first competed in the FIS Snowboard World Cup during the 1996‚Äì97 season, twice standing on the podium in her rookie season. She competed at her first Olympics in 1998 in Nagano where only parallel giant slalom and halfpipe were Olympic snowboard events. Ricker competed in the halfpipe event placing fifth. After Nagano, Ricker began competing in multiple snowboard disciplines, competing in both the halfpipe and in the newer sport of boarder cross. She won her first World Cup gold in the discipline of snowboard cross later that year in 1998. She was forced to skip the 2002 Winter Olympics because of injury. At the 2006 Winter Olympics she placed 23rd in Women's halfpipe and 4th in the Women's Snowboard Cross event. She crashed hard in the race, and was hospitalized with a minor concussion. Ricker later said that she did not remember her crash, and that finishing fourth in 2006 was like \\"seeing the love of your life on the subway but never getting to meet them.\\" Ricker won a bronze medal in the same event at Winter X Games XI. She was the overall world cup champion during the 07/08 season. She also previously competed in the halfpipe world championships, with her highest finish being 7th in 2003. She is a two time X Games gold medalist in snowboard cross winning the gold in both the 1999 Winter X Games and the Winter X-Games 10. 2010 Winter Olympics Maelle Ricker (red) trails Mellie Francon at a World Cup event in Bad Gastein in January, 2010. Ricker did exceptionally well in the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games. She headed into the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver as the overall leader in the 2009‚Äì10 FIS Snowboard World Cup. She skipped the Winter X Games in January to focus on the Olympics. The women's snowboard cross event began on February 16, and the event started out nervously enough for the Canadian contingent in women's snowboard cross. Both she and Dominique Maltais fell on the same berm on their first qualifying run. With fog and weather conditions threatening to cancel the second and final qualifying run, both Canadians would have been out of the finals if officials had canceled the run. However the decision was made to carry on with the qualifying, conditions improved, and Ricker would successfully qualify in third place. When asked about her fall after the race Ricker said that it \\"was heartbreaking after that first run. I had to go back up to the start, refocus and think about my lines. I had to visualize all the stuff we‚Äôve been training all week, all year, the last few years.\\" Ricker won her quarter-final with ease, but because of only finishing third in qualifying, was placed in a semi-final with gold medal contender Lindsey Jacobellis. In the run, however, Jacobellis was disqualified for missing a gate and Ricker carried on, qualifying for the A-final. In the medal final Ricker again took a large lead out of the starting gate and won the gold medal with relative ease, becoming the first Canadian woman to win an Olympic gold medal on home soil. Ricker won the gold just minutes from her childhood home in North Vancouver and described the Olympic victory \\"like a crazy dream\\". For Ricker, the gold was redemption for her fall and concussion during the 2006 Olympic Games in Turin. She said that \\"Turin was such a motivator for me. It just made me work that much harder and just go for it today.\\" Present Ricker followed her successful Olympics with a great start to the 2010‚Äì11 FIS Snowboard World Cup. She was second in the snowboard cross standings for the World Cup heading into the 2011 FIS Snowboarding World Championships. In the finals of the snowboard cross at the World Championships Ricker was closely following longtime nemesis Jacobellis. While trying to pass, she got too close to Jacobellis, caught an edge, and crashed, injuring her hand and finishing fourth. Ricker won a bronze medal at the XVI Winter X Games where fellow Canadian Maltais had won that year. She also managed several podiums through that part of the 2011‚Äì12 FIS Snowboard World Cup, though not achieving any victories. At the 2013 World Championships, Ricker struck gold again. She managed to beat compatriot Maltais, who had won most of the World Cup events, however Ricker pipped her to the line on the battle that occurred on home soil at these championships. This was Ricker's first gold medal at the World Championships, despite winning nearly every contest she has entered, this medal eluded her until this competition which she won at the age of 34. Ricker lightly made note of both her and Maltais' age versus their competitors when she said that \\"We‚Äôre the dinosaurs of the group. But experience plays a lot in these technical races. It‚Äôs definitely something I have to use to my advantage since I don‚Äôt have youth on my side anymore. I have to be smart with my training, smart with some of my landings\\". Just days before the 2014 Olympics were to begin Ricker suffered a wrist injury severe enough that it required surgery, in a training session. Despite this the Canadian Olympic Committee expected that she would be able to compete at the games. She was the second Canadian snowboarder to suffer an injury just before the games after Mark McMorris, also a gold medal contender, was injured in his final run at the 2014 Winter X Games. Personal Ricker grew up in West Vancouver, the daughter of Karl Ricker, now a retired geologist, and Nancy Ricker, now a retired biology professor from Capilano University. When Ricker was a child her father had wanted her to take up skiing, but she chose snowboarding instead. She first learned to snowboard in her teens when she chased her brother J√∂rli Ricker down Whistler Mountain and credits her brother for getting her into the sport of snowboarding. As a student, Ricker attended high school at Sentinel Secondary School in West Vancouver. Ricker lists Clara Hughes, Canadian flag bearer at the opening ceremonies for the 2010 games, as her hero. Ricker is bilingual, speaking both French and English fluently.

Hyrrokkin is a female j√∂tunn in Norse mythology. According to 13th- century poet Snorri Sturluson, she launched the largest of all ships at Baldr's funeral after the √Üsir (gods) when unable to budge the vessel. Hyrrokkin was a relatively important figure in the last decades of paganism in Iceland. She appears to be depicted on one of the DR 284 stone from the Hunnestad Monument near Marsvinsholm, Sweden.  Name  The Old Norse name Hyrrokkin has been translated has 'fire-withered' or 'fire-steamer'. According to linguist Jan de Vries, it is compound formed with the root hyr- ('fire') attached to hrokkinn ('curly; wrinkle'). Scholar John Lindow has proposed the translation 'fire-smoked', perhaps referring to a dark, shrivelled appearance.  Attestations = Eddas  It is told in Snorri Sturluson's Gylfaginning that at Baldr's funeral his wife Nanna died of grief and was placed alongside him on his pyre, thus joining her husband in Hel. Hringhorni, Baldr's ship, was the largest of all such vessels and was to serve as the god's funeral ship. No one, however, could seem to launch the boat out to sea. The gods then enlisted the help of Hyrrokkin, who came from J√∂tunheimr, arriving on a giant wolf with vipers as reins. When she dismounted, Odin summoned four berserks to look after the animal but they were unable to control it without first rendering it unconscious. With her seismic strength, the giantess rolled the boat into the water. This caused the earth to quake and the rollers to set on fire, which angered Thor. He was about to kill Hyrrokkin with his hammer Mj√∂llnir, but the other gods insisted that he spare her. { cellpadding=\\"3\\"  En √¶sirnir t√≥ku l√≠k Baldrs ok fluttu til s√¶var.

But when they wanted to launch it in order to make Baldur's funeral pile on it, they were unable to make it stir. In this conjuncture they sent to Jotunheim for a certain giantess named Hyrrokin, who came mounted on a wolf, having twisted serpents for a bridle. As soon as she alighted, Odin ordered four Berserkir to hold her steed fast, who were, however, obliged to throw the animal on the ground ere they could effect their purpose. Hyrrokin then went to the ship, and with a single push set it afloat, but the motion was so violent that the fire sparkled from the rollers, and the earth shook all around. Thor, enraged at the sight, grasped his mallet, and but for the interference of the √Üsir would have broken the woman's skull.  }Hyrrokkin by Ludwig Pietsch (1865) She is also mentioned in a list of troll women by an anonymous skald: :Gj√∂lp, Hyrrokkin, :Hengikepta, :Gneip ok Gnepja, :Geysa, H√°la, :H√∂rn ok Hr√∫ga, :Har√∞greip, Fora√∞, :Hry√∞ja, Hve√∞ra :ok H√∂lgabr√∫√∞r.  Viking Age  The late 10th-century skald √ûorbj√∂rn d√≠sarsk√°ld, in two preserved fragments addressed directly to Thor, mentions Hyrrokkin among the j√∂tnar killed by the thunder-god at Baldur's funeral: {:Ball √≠ Keilu kolli, :Kjallandi brauzt √æ√∫ alla, :√°√∞r draptu L√∫t ok Lei√∞a, :l√©ztu dreyra B√∫seyru; :heftir √æ√∫ Hengjankj√∂ftu, :Hyrrokkin d√≥ fyrri; :√æ√≥ var snemr in s√°ma :Sv√≠v√∂r numin l√≠fi. :Sk√°ldskaparm√°l (4) Gu√∞ni J√≥nsson's edition  :Thou didst smite the head of Keila, :Smash Kjallandi altogether, :Ere thou slewest L√∫tr and Leidi, :Didst spill the blood of B√∫seyra; :Didst hold back Hengjankjapta, :Hyrrokkin died before; :Yet sooner in like fashion :Sv√≠v√∂r from life was taken. :Brodeur's translation (1923)  :[Mj√∂llnir] struck on Keila's skull, :Kjallandi you battered in full; :L√∫t and Leida you‚Äôd already killed, :B√∫seyra's blood you let flow; :Hengjankjapta you finished off, :Hyrrokkin died at an earlier stage, :and similarly Sv√≠v√∂r, earlier still, :was likewise deprived of her life. :Orchard translation (1997) }Hyrrokkin pushes the ship, angering Thor.

The poem H√∫sdr√°pa (House-Lay), composed by √ölfr Uggason around 985 AD in western Iceland and partially preserved in the Prose Edda, also appears to refer to Hyrrokkin at Baldr's funeral: :\\"The very powerful Hild of the mountains [giantess]Hild or Hildr in this context is simply a kenning for \\"giantess\\" generally and Hyrrokkin specifically. caused the sea-Sleipnir [ship] to lumber forward, but the wielders of the helmet flames [warriors] of Hropt [Odin] felled her mount.\\" See also *Snake-witch stone, a picture stone depicting a female grasping two snakes References=References  * External links Category:G√Ωgjar ","title":"Hyrrokkin"},{"id":"4111387","text":"Vashon Island High School (VHS) is a public high school located on Vashon Island, Washington.

These performers are generally indistinguishable from the more common cisgender male or transgender (MTF) drag queens in artistic style and techniques. While all these terms are used both by performers and in the media, many are considered offensive. The term \\"faux queen\\" is rejected and considered outdated by many drag artists for implying that AFAB drag queens are not as \\"real\\" as cisgender male drag queens, and the terms \\"bio queen\\" and \\"female queen\\" are considered by many performers to be transphobic as they imply that a transgender (MTF) woman who performs as a drag queen is not female and that a transgender (FTM) man is. Other descriptions include \\"biologically challenged\\" drag queen, \\"female female impersonator\\", or \\"female impersonator impersonator.\\" All of these terms are generally considered acceptable only when used by the performer themselves, and many drag queens reject all terms that define them by their sex. Concept Like all drag performers, AFAB drag queens play with traditional gender roles and gender norms to educate and entertain. AFAB queens can appear alongside drag kings or drag queens at drag shows and are interchangeable with other drag queens as emcees, performers, hostesses, and spokesmodels. For some it can be a way to redefine postmodern feminism; AFAB queen Ms. Lucia Love stated, \\"Drag queens would be nowhere without women.\\" For others it simply is about dressing up and having fun. In San Francisco, the first ever \\"Faux Queen\\" pageant was produced as a benefit by Diet PopstituteDiet Popstitute, aka Michael Joseph Collins; 1958 - 1995 Alvin Orloff and the first title holder was Coca Dietetica aka Laurie Bushman. The Klubstitute Kollective was formed after Diet Popstitute's death to continue to raise funds and provide a space for the performers who, at the time, weren't always welcome in regular drag venues. Pageant organizer Ruby Toosday had \\"friends who got fired (from drag clubs) for being women...it seemed like we had definitely hit a nerve. Contestants were judged on drag, talent, and personality by a panel of judges and the winner helped \\"femcee\\" the following year. The pageants were held from 1996 to 2005. The Faux Queen Pageant was resurrected in 2012 by former title holder Bea Dazzler, and will continue to be a yearly competition in San Francisco. Fauxnique (dancer & performance artist Monique Jenkinson) became the first cisgender female drag queen to win a major drag pageant‚Äîcompeting against male or MTF drag queens‚Äîwhen she was crowned Miss Trannyshack 2003. From Bust Magazine: \\"'(drag) comes down to a sort of self-awareness, a self-consciousness about playing around with femininity,' says Fauxnique. She adds that while drag for her is primarily about performance, it's also a 'rejection of traditional oppressive forms of masculinity‚Äîand that's part of an affinity with gay men as well. I wouldn't say every faux queen is a feminist, but I would say that a part of them is in some way.'\\" In the 1970s and 1980s, German-born Brazilian cisgender female queen Elke Maravilha became a popular TV personality after participating as a judge in Chacrinha and Silvio Santos talent shows. According to her, \\"many people think I am a transvestite. When they ask me this, I jokingly reply that I'm a man indeed. And of the most gifted ones\\".Neves, Carla (September 16, 2007). \\"\\"Quando me perguntam se sou travesti, digo que sou homem, e dos mais dotados\\", brinca Elke Maravilha\\" . UOL. Retrieved 2011-02-19. The comedy films Connie and Carla and Victor Victoria both center on cisgender female drag queens, but the main characters of both films are women who are forced by circumstance to work as drag queens. They keep their gender a secret and impersonate men when off-stage, quite unlike their real-life counterparts. The 2020 reality TV vogue competition Legendary was the first US reality television show to include cisgender women performing and competing as drag queens, including the all-female team representing House of Ninja. The reality competition Dragula featured two AFAB performers in their third season, but winner Landon Cider performs as a drag king and contestant Hollow Eve identifies as a non-binary drag artist, not specifically a drag queen.  Controversy  AFAB drag queens are not always permitted or welcomed within drag spaces, which are typically owned and run by cisgender gay men. RuPaul, the producer and host of the reality TV competition RuPaul's Drag Race, has banned female artists from his shows, stating \\"Drag loses its sense of danger and its sense of irony once it‚Äôs not men doing it, because at its core it‚Äôs a social statement and a big f-you to male-dominated culture. So for men to do it, it‚Äôs really punk rock, because it‚Äôs a real rejection of masculinity.\\" After significant backlash, RuPaul amended this response in 2019 to state ‚ÄúI‚Äôve learnt to never say never.‚Äù There are widely- held beliefs within the community that female drag queens do not face the same challenges as cisgender male drag queens, and do not need to use padding, makeup, or tucking to create the illusion of femininity. AFAB artists typically counter that they use the same makeup techniques to create exaggerated femininity, and many do use padding and corsets to create an extreme body shape. Female queens on Instagram often mock this belief that they do not \\"transform\\" their bodies by sharing strikingly different images of themselves in and out of drag with the hashtag #wheresthetransformationsis, started by AFAB queen Creme Fatale. The rejection of AFAB drag queens is often closely linked to other reports of discrimination and objectification that women, transgender men, and nonbinary people assigned female at birth face within LGBT spaces. These artists frequently report groping and harassment from cisgender gay men in gay bars and performance spaces, and report less pay and less tips from audiences. Artists also have complained about drag terminology that they state is exclusionary or offensive; AFAB artist Hollow Eve sparked a significant debate in 2019 when an episode of Dragula aired where they spoke out against the term \\"fishy,\\" used to mean a drag queen who looks like a cisgender woman and referring negatively to the smell of a vulva. The rising prominence of AFAB drag queens and increased dialogue around inclusivity has resulted in many drag artists rejecting any distinction based on their gender and calling for drag competitions to remove all gender and biological sex requirements for contestants.

He was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 2003. Early life Of Khasi origin, Lyngdoh hails from the northeastern state of Meghalaya. He did his schooling from St. Edmund's School, Shillong. Lyngdoh is the son of a district judge. Lyngdoh completed his education in Delhi, at St Stephen's College. Career Lyngdoh entered the IAS, when he was twenty-two. He quickly became known for probity and toughness and for favouring the underdog against politicians and the local rich. In one early post, his principled execution of mandated land reforms so enraged landlords that he was transferred before the year was out. Similar clashes with the powers-that-be marked his rise in the Service. He rose to serve as Secretary, Coordination and Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, Government of India. Work as Election Commissioner In 1997, the president named Lyngdoh one of India's three election commissioners. By 2001 he was chief election commissioner. Lyngdoh soon faced crisis in two of India's most troubled states. Gujarat Elections, and Confrontation with Narendra Modi In July 2002, S S Bhandari, Governor of Gujarat on the recommendation of State Cabinet headed by Chief Minister Narendra Modi, dissolved the Gujarat Assembly nine months before its term was due to end. The decision, attacked by main Opposition Congress and Left parties, was seen as an attempt to force the Election Commission to hold early elections in view of the Constitutional mandate prohibiting a more than six-month gap between two sessions of the House. The dissolution of the assembly had been publicly opposed by the Election Commission in wake of the then recent communal violence in the state. The Election Commission headed by Lyngdoh ruled out early elections in Gujarat. On 20 August 2002, in a public meeting at Bodeli, near Vadodara, Narendra Modi targeted Lyngdoh. Modi insinuated that the reason the Election Commission had delayed holding the Gujarat assembly elections was because Lyngdoh was a Christian. Lyngdoh had hit back at Narendra Modi for attacking him on religious grounds saying it was \\"quite despicable\\" and \\"gossip of menials\\" by those who have not heard of atheism. A day after Prime Minister Vajapayee's rebuke, Modi claimed that the controversy with Lyngdoh was over following Vajpayee's \\"guidelines\\" but reiterated his demand for early assembly elections in Gujarat. In October 2002, the Indian Supreme Court upheld the Election Commission's order to defer assembly elections in Gujarat. Publications In 2004, Lyngdoh published a book titled \\"Chronicles of an Impossible Election \\". In this book he has dealt with the electoral process in India and the role of Election Commission. It is a chronicle of the assembly elections held in Jammu and Kashmir in the year 2002. It also discusses the Gujarat elections of 2002. The book received widespread acclaim and praise. View on Indian Politics and Politicians Lyngdoh has frequently expressed his disdain for politics and politicians. In February 2004, in an interview, Lyngdoh had said: \\"Politicians by appointment only, all others are welcome to my house.\\". In August 2002, Lyngdoh had said that \\"\\"I think the politics today is dirty, vitiated and tendentious.\\" Lyngdoh described politicians as a \\"cancer\\" which has no cure. In 2013, J M Lyngdoh has expressed in views on \\"Decriminalization of Indian Electoral system\\" at the quarterly lecture series organised by the Centre of Public Policy Research (CPPR) supported by South Indian Bank Post retirement * He remains active in public life after retirement. He is one of the members of India Rejuvenation Initiative an Indian anti-corruption organisation formed by a group of retired and serving bureaucrats. * In February 2011, Lyngdoh, while speaking to journalists after chairing a session on Free & Fair Elections ‚Äì The Soul of Democracy, said state funding of elections is 'useless' and that a proportionate representation system where the electoral fight takes place between parties and not candidates would be more appropriate since it would involve significantly less expenditure. In June 2012, Lyngdoh, while addressing a round table on \\"Indian Democracy & Elections ‚Äì What is to be done?\\", said that a proportional representation system for at least 50 percent of the seats of the legislatures would reduce electoral malpractices. He explained that political parties would reduce the need to spend huge amounts of funds on elections of individuals if the switch to proportional representation is made. He opined that the Election Commission should take charge of even the internal elections of political parties since in his opinion that is the only way to ensure democracy.

Born a surgery professor's son, he studied medicine in Munich and served as a doctor at the front in World War I (1914‚Äì1918). Among other things, he was awarded the Iron Cross, first class. From 1919, Wagner ran his own medical practice in Munich, while also being a member of two Freikorps between 1921 and 1923, von Epp and Oberland. Just because of his Upper Silesian origins, Wagner stayed on (till 1924) as leader of the Upper Silesia German Community Associations (Deutschtumsverb√§nde Oberschlesiens) and was chef of Munich¬¥s division of the Loyal Upper Silesians (‚ÄûVerb√§nde heimattreuer Oberschlesier\\"). In May 1929, he switched to the NSDAP. Wagner was co-founder and as of 1932 leader of the National Socialist German Doctors' League, and also functioned from 1933 as a member of the Palatinate Landtag. A year later, in 1934, Wagner was ordered to the position of Reich Doctors' Leader. Moreover, he was \\"The F√ºhrer's Commissioner for National Health\\". By 1933, he had already become leader of the Main Office for National Health, and in 1936 came his appointment as that office's Main Service Leader (Hauptdienstleiter). In December 1935, Wagner became leader of the Reichs√§rztekammer (Physicians' Chamber). At the 1936 Nuremberg Rally, he discussed the racial laws. As was typical of Nazi propaganda at this time, this was more in terms of the pure and growing race than the evil of the Jews.\\"Race and Population Policy\\" A shift in his political career came in 1937 when he was promoted to SA Obergruppenf√ºhrer. Meanwhile, he was also commissioner for collegiate issues on Rudolf Hess's staff. Wagner died quite young, at only 50. The cause of his sudden death is to this day unknown. His successor was Leonardo Conti. Gerhard Wagner was jointly responsible for euthanasia and sterilization carried out against Jews and the handicapped, and showed himself at the Nuremberg Party Congress in 1935 to be a staunch proponent of the Nuremberg Laws, and thereby also of Nazi Germany's race legislation and racial politics. Under Wagner's leadership, the Nazi killing institution at Hadamar was established.

XVIII Annius of Viterbo (; 13 November 1502) was an Italian Dominican friar, scholar, and historian, born Giovanni Nanni (Nenni) in Viterbo. He is now remembered for his fabrications. He entered the Dominican Order early in life. He obtained the degree of Master of Theology from the studium generale at Santa Maria sopra Minerva, the forerunner of the College of Saint Thomas and the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum. He served as a lector at the studium sometime before 1466.Riccardo Fubini, NANNI, Giovanni Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 77 (2012) He was highly esteemed by Sixtus IV and Alexander VI; the latter made him Master of the Sacred Palace in 1499. As a linguist, he spuriously claimed to be skilled in the Oriental languages. Walter Stephensin Giants in Those Days (1989), p. 131. says: \\"His expertise in Semitic philology, once celebrated even by otherwise sober ecclesiastical historians, was entirely fictive.\\" Annius also claimed to be able to read Etruscan. In perhaps his most elaborate pseudo-archeological charade, in the autumn of 1493, he undertook a well-publicized dig at Viterbo, during which marble statues of some of the most dramatic of the mythical figures associated with the city's legendarium appeared to be unearthed; they had all been \\"salted\\" in the site beforehand.Roberto Weiss, The Renaissance Discovery of Classical Antiquity (1969:114).

In this work, he published alleged writings and fragments of several pre-Christian Greek and Latin profane authors, destined to throw an entirely new light on ancient history.

Among his numerous other writings were De futuris Christianorum triumphis in Turcos et Saracenos (Future Triumphs of the Christians over the Turks and the Saracens), a commentary on the Apocalypse, dedicated to Sixtus IV, to Christian kings, princes, and governments,Genoa, 1480 and Tractatus de imperio TurcorumPublished in Genoa, 1480 (The Empire of the Turks). The author claims that Mohammad is the Antichrist, and that the end of the world will take place when the Christians will have overcome the Jews and the Muslims, an event which did not appear to him to be far distant. One influential suggestion he made‚Äîin his commentary on the Breviarium de Temporibus of Pseudo-Philo the Jew‚Äîwas that the genealogy of Jesus in the Gospel of Luke traced the lineage through the father of Mary.http://www.rtforum.org/lt/lt11.html#FN_25 In the Breviarium de Temporibus, the Christ's grandfather Eli according to Luke was identified with Eliachim, an alleged variant of St Joachim, the Virgin Mary's father according to the apocryphal Protoevangelium of James. According to Annius, the Marian direct descendance from king David testified Christ's inheritance of the throne of Israel in the lineage of His holy mother. The more important of his unpublished works are: * Volumen libris septuaginta distinctum de antiquitatibus et gestis Etruscorum; * De correctione typographica chronicorum; * De dignitate officii Magistri Sacri Palatii (On the Esteem of the Office of the Master of the Sacred Palace); and lastly, * The Chronologia Nova, in which he undertakes to correct the anachronisms in the writings of Eusebius of Caesarea. * De marmoreis volturrhenis tabulis: the modern editor's preface affirmed it was \\"the first epigraphic study in western scholarship\\". (reprinted in 2011) He was notorious for his text depicting the history and topography of ancient Rome from the \\"most ancient\\" authors. His Auctores vetustissimi printed at Rome, 1498, was an anthology of seventeen purportedly classical texts, all of which he had written himself, with which he embarks in the gigantic attempt to write a universal history of the post-diluvian West civilization, where the Etruscan people and the town of Viterbo/Etruria, custodian of the original knowledge of divine nature, takes on the leading role in the march of Man towards the future. Annio's map of Rome as founded by Romulus is a loose interpretation of one of his own forgeries. It prominently features Vicus Tuscus, the home of the Etruscans, whom Annio and his fellow Viterbans claimed as their ancestors. Part of the forgeries were motivated by a desire to prove that Viterbo was the site of the Etruscan Fanum Voltumnae. In a defense of the papal lending institution, the Monte di Piet√†, published c. 1495 under the title Pro Monte Pietatis, Annio contributed the essay Questiones due disputate super mutuo iudaico & ciuili & diuino, arguing against the usury of the Jews.dated from Viterbo, 8 May 1492 (Rhodes) Looking for a patronage, Annius published its first treatise in February 1491 and dedicated it to Ranuccio Farnese. Analyzing the works of Diodorus Siculus, Annius supposed Isis and Osiris established new colonies in the Mediterranean Sea, the latter founding Viterbo, so as to derive a divine and Egyptian ancestry for the family of the ongoing Pope Alexander III, brother of Ranuccio. Detection of his forgeries The Antiquities met at once both with believers and with severe critics who accused him of willful interpolation, or even fabrication. The content was falsely attributed to Berosus, Fabius Pictor, Cato the Elder, Manetho and others. The spurious character of these \\"historians\\" of Annio, which he published both with and without commentaries, has long been admitted.Colbert left to the Biblioth√®que Nationale at Paris a manuscript of the thirteenth century, supposed to contain fragments of the writings of two of these writers, i.e. Berosus and Megasthenes. The demolition of the forgeries owed much to Joseph Justus Scaliger. Annio's forgeries began to unravel by the mid-16th century. In 1565‚Äì66, the humanist Girolamo Mei was engaged in a historiographical argument with Vincenzo Borghini, who presented a claim, for the occasion of the marriage of Francesco I de' Medici and Giovanna of Austria, that Florence was founded by Augustus. He based his claim on inscriptions reported by Annio da Viterbo. Mei, no friend to the Medici, challenged this opinion and questioned the authenticity of Annio's materials, in a brief Latin treatise (De origine urbis Florentiae). Viterbiae historiae epitoma The volume Annio da Viterbo, Documenti e ricerche (Rome: Multigrafica Editrice for CNR, 1981) presents an unpublished work written by Annio: the Viterbiae historiae epitoma in the critical text edited by Giovanni Baffioni. The text is based on the manuscript Codex Vaticanus Latinus 6263 and represents the seventh and only extant book of the former work of Annius' Viterbia Historia, composed of seven books in which the viterbian theologian writes the history of his municipal town ranging from its mythological origins (newly reinvented by Annius himself) until the times of Pope Innocent VIII. The second part of the book, edited by Paola Mattiangeli, deals with his influence on High Renaissance myth and allegory. In particular, it refers to Annio's esoteric interests and his influence over a number of painted frescoes in the city of Viterbo characterized by Egyptian imagery.

Charles Croall, sr., relocated to Hamilton, setting up a construction business (Croall Construction) to build houses en- masse for the government. These subdivisions became known as 'State house areas' and were typically inhabited by lower socio-economic communities. Large numbers of those houses have been sold to private buyers, both individually and in bulk.

He is a supporting character of the Hulk. He was portrayed by P.J. Kerr in a cameo in the 2008 Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Incredible Hulk. Publication history Created by Roy Thomas and Herb Trimpe, the character made his first appearance in The Incredible Hulk (vol. 2) #131 (September 1970) as an angry young man who befriends the Hulk. During the late 1970s, he became a regular supporting character of the series, usually appearing as a friend of Bruce Banner. He was a replacement for the comic's original teen sidekick, Rick Jones, who had moved to Captain Marvel. In The Incredible Hulk #232 (February 1979), it is revealed that Jim Wilson is the nephew of Sam Wilson, the superhero Falcon. Though this revelation occurred when Roger Stern was writing the series, Stern says that earlier Incredible Hulk writer Len Wein came up with the idea that they were related and simply didn't get around to it during his run. Wilson was dropped from the series by 1980, and did not return until The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #388 (December 1991), in which it is revealed that Wilson was HIV- positive. He dies of complications from AIDS in The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #420 (August 1994). Fictional character biography James \\"Jim\\" Wilson grew up in Harlem and wanted to travel where he was often at odds with his father Gideon Wilson who worked as a Catholic minister. Wilson enlists Rick Jones to play a benefit concert at a hospice for AIDS patients. On the drive from the airport, Wilson reveals to Jones that he is HIV-positive and that his girlfriend left him. Wilson is injured while protecting Jefferson Wolfe from the assassin Speedfreek at the charity concert. Hulk rushes Wilson to a hospital. Jones and Hulk later secure evidence to send the mob boss who employed Speedfreek to prison.The Incredible Hulk Vol. 2 #388 Wilson is again seen in The Incredible Hulk #420 (August 1994), in which he is attacked by a mob protesting the fact that a court has ordered an HIV-infected boy to be allowed into a public school. Hulk is able to rescue Wilson from the mob, and takes him to the hi-tech medical facilities at the Mount, the secret headquarters of the Pantheon, the superhero group which Hulk is a member of. He learns that Wilson actually has AIDS, and has had it for some time. In addition to the broken ribs he sustained in the mob attack, he is suffering from pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and does not have long to live. Remembering the blood transfusion that the Hulk gave his cousin, Jennifer Walters (which turned her into the She-Hulk), Wilson asks Bruce Banner to give him a transfusion of his blood, hoping that the Hulk's blood would act as a cure to the virus. Banner initially refuses to take the risk of creating another monster, but eventually pretends to be giving Wilson a blood transfusion. Wilson reveals in private to Dr. Harr, the attending physician caring for him, that he was not fooled by Bruce's ruse, but played along anyway. Shortly afterward, Jim Wilson succumbs to the disease and dies. After Wilson's death, Bruce donates a large sum of money to the hospice that Wilson worked at in order to allow them to comfortably exist for the next few decades. Gideon Wilson inexplicably blames the Hulk for Jim's death and joins Gamma Corps to seek revenge.World War Hulk: Gamma Corps #1. Marvel Comics (New York). However, he ultimately admits to himself and the Hulk that he only blamed the Hulk for his son's death in order to avoid facing his own guilt for his failures as a father. In other media Jim Wilson has a brief appearance in The Incredible Hulk played by P.J. Kerr. He is a student at Culver University and along with his friend Jack McGee witness the battle between the Hulk and General Ross's army.

It was carved by an architect whose designs for St. Mary's Church had been rejected by a committee. Some years later when designing an office building across the road, he placed a carving of Satan facing the church and prophesied \\"When your church is destroyed and burnt to the ground my devil will remain laughing\\". This prophecy later came true when the church was bombed during the Second World War. History In the 1890s it was decided that St. Mary's Church in the centre of Swansea would be rebuilt. The task of designing the new church was put to tender. Among those who applied were a local architect and Sir Arthur Blomfield. The committee accepted Blomfield's designs and the church was built. The local man took his rejection as a slight against his talent. After several years a row of cottages adjacent to the church became available for purchase. The offended architect bought these houses, and tore them down. In their place he erected a red brick building to house the brewery offices, on which he placed a carving of Satan, facing the church. The local man is reputed to have prophesied: \\"When your church is destroyed and burnt to the ground my devil will remain laughing.\\" Blitz Swansea, being a major strategic target in South Wales, was bombed heavily during World War II. One of the buildings destroyed during the three night blitz in February 1941 was St. Mary's Church. The building on which Old Nick was mounted was not hit and remained standing through the war thus allowing Old Nick to continue laughing over the burnt remains of the church. Post war In 1962 the brewery offices were torn down, while St. Mary's was rebuilt to the original designs. The devil was left to rot in a garage in Gloucester, until a local historian returned him to Swansea during the 1980s. Present day Occupying the land of the brewery offices is now the Quadrant Shopping Centre, opened in 1979. Once returned to Swansea the devil was placed as close to his original location inside the shopping centre as possible without directly offending the church goers. There was notable religious objection to its reinstallation, and when the Quadrant was refurbished the carving was placed in storage. After public outcry aided by the local newspaper the South Wales Evening Post, the Devil was placed back once more to watch over St. Mary's. In 2019, the carving was donated to the Swansea museum by the owners of the Quadrant.

It is based on the paint, and its application, or the addition of materials such as ribbon, metal, wood, lace, leather and sand. The concept of \\"painterliness\\" also has bearing on texture. The texture stimulates two different senses: sight and touch. There are four types of texture in art: actual, simulated, abstract, and invented texture. Actual texture Actual texture is a combination of how the painting looks, and how it feels on being touched. It is associated both with the heavy buildup of paint, such as an impasto effect, or the addition of materials. Many artists around the world use different items and materials to create actual texture in their pieces, some create textured pieces to be touched and experienced, such as MD Weems. MD Weems uses homemade gesso to sculpt texture into her artwork. Her textured artwork is then painted and sealed so that viewers can physically touch the artwork. The ability to touch the texture evokes multiple senses through sight and touch and allows for a deeper emotional feel. .  Simulated texture  Simulated texture involves drawing the visual effect of texture without actually adding it. For instance, a texture may be cooked to look like something other than paint on a curved surface. An example is Cataract 3, painted in 1967 by Bridget Riley, which creates the illusion of ripples in the paper through the repetition of lines.  Abstract texture The abstract texture does not directly represent the object it is connected with but the concept of the object is translated in textural patterns.  Creative Texture  The invented texture is a creative way of adding alternate materials to create an interesting texture. This texture typically appears in abstract works, as they are entirely non- objective.  Needle texture  Needle texture is a creative way of painting in which small, distinct lines of color are applied in patterns to form a texture image. This texture typically found in acrylic & oil colour.https://wegogallery.art.blog/2019/01/24/needle-texture-acrylic- painting/ See also * Art movement * Creativity techniques * List of art media * List of artistic media * List of art movements * List of most expensive paintings * List of most expensive sculptures * List of art techniques * List of sculptors  References  * Category: Painting techniques ","title":"Texture (painting)"},{"id":"4111553","text":"Osceola High School may refer to: *Osceola High School (Arkansas) in Osceola, Arkansas *Osceola High School (Seminole, Florida) in Seminole, Florida *Osceola High School (Kissimmee, Florida) in Kissimmee, Florida *Osceola High School (Nebraska) in Osceola, Nebraska *Osceola High School (Wisconsin) in Osceola, Wisconsin *Osceola High School (Osceola, Missouri) in Osceola, Missouri ","title":"Osceola High School"},{"id":"4111559","text":"4011 may refer to: * 4011, a 4000-series integrated circuit consisting of quad 2-input NAND gates * 4011, the PLU code for bananas ","title":"4011"},{"id":"4111572","text":"Myshimarina (Marina) Papaelia (, born c. 1931) was Miss Egypt 1952.

Anchor stones set #4 Anchor Stone Blocks () are components of stone construction sets made in Rudolstadt, Germany, marketed as a construction toy. Description Anchor Stone pieces are made of a mixture of quartz sand, chalk, and linseed oil (German Patent 13,770; US Patent 233,780), precisely pressed in molds so that they fit together perfectly. The stones come in three colors in imitation of the red brick, tan limestone, and blue slate of European buildings. They are not recommended for play by children under 3 years of age because of their small size (CE No. 0494). History=Origin Anchor stones originated with the wooden building blocks designed by Friedrich Fr√∂bel, the creator of the Kindergarten system of education. He had observed how children enjoyed playing with geometrically-shaped blocks. The first Anchor Stone was produced when Otto Lilienthal and his brother Gustav decided that make a model of a stone building, using miniature blocks of stone. To this end, they started production of a limited number of blocks, made of a mixture of quartz sand, chalk, and linseed oil. Unfortunately, the Lilienthals, though brilliant inventors, had limited commercial success. The stone blocks saw little popularity until 1880, when Friedrich Adolf Richter, a wealthy businessman who had built a small empire in Rudolstadt, purchased the rights to the process for 1000 marks (about ‚Ç¨510), plus about 4800 marks (including 800 marks still owing) for the tooling and machines being used to produce them. He developed a series of sets of individually-packaged stones, which quickly became popular. Promoted by extensive advertising, 42,000 sets were sold in 1883 (Annual Report for 1883 of the Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt Factory Inspection Service, Archives, Heidecksburg, Rudolstadt). In 1894, Richter applied his \\"Anchor\\" trademark to the Richter's Anchor Stone Building Sets (Richters Anker-Steinbaukasten). More than 600 different sets were produced over the multi-decade life of these sets; more than 1,000 stone shapes were made (CVA Stone Catalog). In 1910 Richter died, heralding the end of the first era for Anchor Stones (Registered as death # 878 in Jena on December 27, 1910; he died at 9:00 PM on December 25, 1910). End and rebirth Although Anchor Stones survived World War I and World War II, the factory was included within Communist East Germany when the Iron Curtain divided Europe. In 1953, the company was nationalized as VEB Anker- Steinbaukasten, a state-owned company. In 1963, the production of the blocks was stopped. The trademark \\"Anker\\" was used by various toy companies in East Germany, none of which were related to the stone building set factory. However, existing sets of old Anchor Stones remained very popular within the international community. In 1979, the Club van Ankervrienden (\\"Club of Anchor Friends\\") was founded in the Netherlands. Initially the membership was limited to Dutch members, but foreign members were admitted starting in 1983. Today the club has about 230 members. With the support of the Club of Anchor Friends, the state of Thuringia, and the European Union, Georg Plenge was able to resurrect the company as Anker Steinbaukasten GmbH. Production at the factory in Rudolstadt restarted 15 September 1994, and new sets were sold to Club members in October 1994. Anchor today Other games by Anchor include the Kopfzerbrecher (\\"head breaker\\" or \\"brain teaser\\") puzzles The new factory manufactures and sells all 15 of the sets in the main series (GK-NF) of Anchor sets as well as some sets modelling the Michaelis Basilika in Hildesheim and the Brandenburg Gate. They are widely available in Germany, including in the KaDeWe department store in Berlin, and are readily available online. A new series of sets for younger children called Die neue Steinzeit (\\"the new Stone Age\\") was introduced in 2012. The sets tend to be expensive, but high-quality; antique sets are just as playable now as when they were originally produced. Sets being produced today are made to the same specifications as the antique ones, so they can be easily integrated. In addition to construction sets, the artificial stone formula has been used to produce simple flat puzzles, such as tangrams.

The first Outlaw named Nigel Higgins is England's version of Punisher that first appeared in Punisher Vol. 2 #64 and was created by Dan Abnett, Andy Lanning, and Douglas Braithwaite. The second Outlaw named Inez Temple was created by Gail Simone for the series Deadpool and Agent X. She is a mutant with the ability of superhuman strength and an uncanny aptitude with firearms. Fictional character biography=Nigel Higgins Nigel Higgins is a man living in England who gets inspired by Punisher's activities that causes him to become the British version of Punisher called Outlaw. At the time when Kingpin planned to use the English channel to gather the European crime families into a united crime syndicate, Outlaw was the main contact for Punisher and Microchip.Punisher Vol. 2 #64-70 During the \\"Suicide Run\\" crossover, Outlaw hears about Punisher's death and heads to the United States of America to investigate. When Punisher was found to be alive in the small town of Laastekist, Outlaw got mixed in with every copycat, ally, and villain that were converging on the location.Punisher Vol. 2 #86-88 As part of the \\"All-New, All-Different Marvel\\" brand, Outlaw has left the vigilante business upon regretting if he should let bad guys live or not.Contest of Champions #10 Upon moving to New Yorkshire, Outlaw assumed the alias of \\"Neil Hibbs.\\" His normal life was short-lived when he is chosen by Collector to partake in the \\"Contest of Champions\\" against his will at the Battlerealm.Contest of Champions #1 As part of Collector's team, Outlaw survived every battle. When Collector's right-hand man Maestro of Earth-69413 betrays Collector and takes the Iso-Sphere, Outlaw witnesses this action as Maestro becomes the new ruler of a reassembled Battleworld.Contest of Champions #6 Outlaw and the other contestants were defeated by Maestro as the two-presumed dead contestants Stick and Sentry of Earth-1611 appeared to cut Maestro's victory short. Upon getting hold of the Iso-Sphere, Outlaw used its powers to have Maestro contained somewhere, the other contestants to return to whichever place they want, and for the Iso-Sphere to shatter. Upon returning to England with the Earth-616 contestants, Outlaw had also wished for those he had killed to be returned to life. Outlaw then returned to the superhero business where he helps those in need instead of punishing the guilty. During the Secret Empire storyline, Outlaw appears as a member of the Champions of Europe. The group, alongside Squirrel Girl and Enigma, successfully drives off the violent Hydra forces that had tried to claim Paris, France.U.S.Avengers #7-9 (2017) Inez Temple Inez Temple was born in Texas and as a child she was bullied by other children, who called her Crazy Inez. This nickname still enrages Inez. Due to her mutant strength, she was far stronger than her peers and beat them whenever they bullied her, but her father taught her to be responsible with her powers. She is a descendant of Lance Temple, who was also known as the Wild West gunman The Outlaw Kid.Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe A-Z vol.9Deadpool Rank and Foul When she grew up, she became a mercenary, covering her hair with a long, blonde wig and even had breast augmentation surgery.Agent X #2, October 2002 She encountered Deadpool several times and flirted with him, but the two never really got a chance to hit it off. Outlaw was called in as a shooting instructor for Alex Hayden aka Agent X. They were both hired shortly afterwards to steal the Punisher's Colt .45 handguns and despite being competitors, they started a romantic relationship. They failed to steal the Punisher's guns and were locked up in a phone booth minus their weapons and clothes by Castle. The Punisher then killed the people who had sent them. After that Outlaw started to work with Agent X. When Alex announced his plans to set up a special agency for mercenaries, known as Agency X, she had to disappoint him though; her father had taken ill and she went back to Texas to be with him. She returned after her father died and discovered that in her absence Alex had had an affair with his secretary Sandi Brandenberg. Her rage vanished when she saw that Alex was being attacked by the Black Swan. Black Swan called Outlaw \\"Crazy Inez\\" and in a fit of rage, Outlaw punched straight through his torso. This wasn't enough to kill Black Swan though and together with Taskmaster and Sandi, they defeated the Black Swan. Outlaw and Alex continued their relationship (as did Sandi and Taskmaster). She aided Alex Hayden with his mercenary company, Agency X, but with the end of the Agent X series, she disappeared from the limelight. After Decimation, she was one of the few mutants to retain her powers. Heeding Cyclops's call for sanctuary, Outlaw went to the X-Mansion for protection and ran into Peepers along the way who was on the run from the Sapien League and battling their leader, the Leper Queen. She becomes one of the 198, and was bunking with Magma and Skids. She struck a rather friendly relationship with Magma; listening when Magma complains about Empath always following her and never leaving her alone even in her dreams. When a group of superheroes known as the New Warriors accidentally blow up a town causing the general public to turn on superheroes and eventually ignite a superhero civil war. Domino, Shatterstar and Caliban break out the 198 and take them to a bunker in the middle of the desert. They get sealed inside with nuclear weapons and are activated for self-detonation. Outside the X-Men get involved with a fight against Bishop and the O*N*E and Domino wants to help them. Lorelei Travis notices that Cyclops is being controlled by Johnny Dee and recounts the story of the first few days at the 198 encampment. Outlaw is then used by Johnny Dee along with other mutants to attack Domino and Shatterstar. After holding Domino at gunpoint, Toad snaps her out of it. They are all freed from the bunker by combined X-Men, Avengers and military forces. Outlaw takes a leadership role throughout the crisis.X-Men: Civil War #1-4 (2006) Outlaw was later kidnapped, bound and gagged along with Sandi Brandenberg by T-Ray, one of Deadpool's nemeses. Deadpool swiftly rescued them, seemingly killing T-Ray by skewering his head with his sword. The two were reunited with a now-obese Agent X, after being experimented on by HYDRA, and ended up under Deadpool's employ after being tentatively appointed head of Agency X by Hayden. Outlaw and Sandi then joined Weasel to help bring Deadpool and Bob: Agent of HYDRA back to the present day, after Weasel accidentally transported the two to World War II. After they were restored, the two stayed with the Fantastic Four, allegedly to play cards. After being critically wounded from a fight with the Punisher, Deadpool comes to Outlaw for assistance. She reveals that she and Agent X are no longer in a relationship.Deadpool: Suicide Kings #2 Deadpool later returns and remodels her house after it is destroyed during a fight with the Punisher. She then sleeps with Deadpool after seeing that he actually cares for her.Deadpool: Suicide Kings # 5 Recently Outlaw has been seen on the mutant island of Utopia. During Second Coming, after the dome is set and the Nimrods arrive, Cyclops gathers mutants, including Inez, and delivers a speech saying that it's everyone's time to fight, today they are all combatants, today they are all X-Men.New Mutants #14 Powers and abilities The Nigel Higgins version of Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms. The Inez Temple version of Outlaw has some degree of superhuman strength, the exact limits of which aren't known. However, she can punch through brick walls with ease. The tissues of her body are somewhat more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human. However, she is far from invulnerable and can be injured by weapons composed of conventional materials or with sufficient force, much like an ordinary human. Nonetheless she can withstand high caliber bullets without them penetrating, though she isn't totally impervious to them. In at least one instance after being shot with .45 caliber bullet from a moderate distance, Inez sustained no more injury other than some bruises. If injured, Outlaw is capable of healing herself somewhat faster from minor injuries than an ordinary human. Apart from her mutant powers, Outlaw has exceptional skills with firearms and with a lasso. Alternate versions=Deadpool Pulp In re-imagining of Deadpool set during the McCarthy era, the Inez Temple version of Outlaw is a fugitive from the United States after she is accused of stealing atomic bomb equipment.Deadpool Pulp #1-4 (Nov. 2010 - Feb. 2011) Deadpool MAX In this version, Outlaw is an insane asylum patient with dissociative multiple personality disorder with whom Deadpool has a brief relationship. She first poses as a psychiatrist to lure Deadpool there in order to extract his organs for illegal donations at the behest of a hospital doctor, but develops feelings for him and helps him escape.Deadpool MAX #2 Later on, she reappears as Domino, asking Deadpool to elope with her as she reveals to be pregnant with his babyDeadpool MAX #6; however, the pregnancy is soon revealed to be fake and, through the trust of a Deadpool in denial, she assumes an appearance similar to Black Widow under the name \\"Honey Moon\\", in which Deadpool has her committed to the asylum again.Deadpool MAX #7 She is seen later still as a Mrs. Claus-styled dominatrix called \\"Santa Clawz\\", with delusions of wanting to destroy Christmas by giving guns to children and forcing other inmates to make the weapons; only all they can do is draw guns on papers, and Deadpool and Bob quickly talk her down again.Deadpool MAX X-Mas Special Her \\"Outlaw\\" persona only appears in flashbacks told by Agent X, another inmate whom she trained and asked to go after Bob and Deadpool for the US$ 10 million bounty on their heads.Deadpool MAX II #4 In other media=Video games * The Inez Temple version of Outlaw appears as a member of the S.H.I.E.L.D. team that confronts the Punisher in the final cutscene of the 2009 PlayStation Network game The Punisher: No Mercy.

It is most commonly found from Alberta, Canada, east to Manitoba and south across the Rocky Mountains, Great Plains, and U.S. Midwest states, onto the northern Mexican Plateau in Mexico. Blue grama accounts for most of the net primary productivity in the shortgrass prairie of the central and southern Great Plains. It is a green or greyish, low-growing, drought-tolerant grass with limited maintenance. Description Blue grama grass in early summer The comb-like spike in bloom in August, with white stigmas sticking out of the top and yellow anthers hanging below Mature spikelets that have detached from the spike. Each may contain a seed. Blue grama has green to greyish leaves less than wide and long. The overall height of the plant is at maturity. The flowering stems (culms) are long. At the top are one to four, usually two, comb-like spikes, which extend out at a sharp angle from the flowering stem. Each spike has 20 to 90 spikelets. Each spikelet is long, and has one fertile floret and one or two reduced sterile ones. Below the florets are two glumes, one long and the other long. The fertile floret has a lemma (bract) long, with three short awns (bristles) at the tip, and the sterile floret has a lemma about long with three awns about long. If pollinated, the fertile floret produces an oblong-elliptic brown seed long. When the seed is mature, the whole spikelet detaches, except for the two glumes, which remain. The roots generally grow outwards, and deep. Blue grama is readily established from seed, but depends more on vegetative reproduction via tillers. Seed production is slow, and depends on soil moisture and temperature. Seeds dispersed by wind only reach a few meters (6 ft); farther distances are reached with insects, birds, and mammals as dispersal agents. Seedling establishment, survival, and growth are greatest when isolated from neighboring adult plants, which effectively exploit water in the seedling's root zone. Successful establishment requires a modest amount of soil moisture during the extension and development of adventitious roots. Established plants are grazing-, cold-, and drought-tolerant, though prolonged drought leads to a reduction in root number and extent. They employ an opportunistic water-use strategy, rapidly using water when available, and becoming dormant during less-favorable conditions. In terms of successional status, blue grama is a late seral to climax species. Recovery following disturbance is slow and depends on the type and extent of the disturbance.  Distribution  Blue grama has the widest distribution of all grama grasses. It will grow on most soil types, and readily adapts to local conditions. It can be found as far north as Alberta, and as far south as Mexico. It is present in most of the Midwestern United States, extending east to Missouri and Texas, and as far west as Southern California. It has been introduced to some eastern states, as well as South America. Horticulture and agriculture Blue grama is valued as forage, and is the most valuable grama. It is an ideal range grass in the southwest. It will survive heavy grazing and extreme drought, and is quite palatable to livestock. Grazing of blue grama rangelands might also prevent invasion of undesirable weedy plants. Blue grama is grown by the horticulture industry, and used in perennial gardens, naturalistic and native plant landscaping, habitat restoration projects, and residential, civic, and highway erosion control. Blue grama flowers are also used in dried flower arrangements. Blue grama is the state grass of Colorado and New Mexico. It is listed as an endangered species in Illinois. Blue grama has a large genome relative to other grama grasses. It can be diploid or tetraploid. Among the Zuni people, the grass bunches are tied together and the severed end is used as a hairbrush, the other as a broom. Bunches are also used to strain goat's milk. The Costanoan, or Ohlone, use(d) the hollow stems as drinking straws. The Navajo use(d) it as sheep and horse feed. Ecology Blue grama is the dominant species of the US shortgrass steppe ecoregion. Populations of blue grama across the great plains are genetically differentiated (even at small spatial scales) and show functional trait variance connected to climate. Blue grama from more arid grasslands are also characterized by greater phenotypic plasticity. It is a larval host to the Garita skipperling, green skipper, Pahaska skipper, Rhesus skipper, Simius roadside skipper, and the Uncas skipper.The Xerces Society (2016), Gardening for Butterflies: How You Can Attract and Protect Beautiful, Beneficial Insects, Timber Press.

She was named after an island near the coast of Delaware. Construction Burton Island was one of the icebreakers designed by Lt Cdr Edward Thiele and Gibbs & Cox of New York, who modeled them after plans for European icebreakers he obtained before the start of World War II. She was the sixth of seven completed ships of the Wind-class of icebreakers operated by the United States Coast Guard. Her keel was laid on 15 March 1946 at Western Pipe and Steel Company shipyards in San Pedro, California, she was launched on 30 April 1946, and commissioned on 28 December 1946 with Commander Gerald L. Ketchum in command. Her hull was of unprecedented strength and structural integrity, with a relatively short length in proportion to the great power developed, a cut away forefoot, rounded bottom, and fore, aft and side heeling tanks. Diesel electric machinery was chosen for its controllability and resistance to damage. Burton Island was built during peacetime, so she had a much lighter armament than her war-built sisters, one 38 cal. deck gun and three quad-mounted Bofors 40 mm anti-aircraft autocannons when in Navy service, and unarmed for the Coast Guard. Ship's history=U.S. Navy, 1947‚Äì1966 On 17 January 1947, Burton Island, loaded with supplies, steamed from San Diego to the Ross Sea, Antarctica where she met with units of TF 68 on the first Antarctica Development project, Operation Highjump. After returning from Antarctica, Burton Island departed 25 July 1947 for the Point Barrow expedition to Alaska. From April 1948 to December 1956, Burton Island participated in 19 Arctic and Alaskan cruises, including Operation Windmill. During Operation Windmill in the Antarctic Burton Island was the flagship of CDR Gerald L. Ketchum, USN commander of Task Force 39. Duties on the cruises varied including, supply activities, helicopter reconnaissance of ice flows, scientific surveys, underwater demolition surveys, and convoy exercises. In March 1949, Burton Island was redesignated AGB-1. One prominent excursion was with the submarines USS Seadragon (SSN-584) and USS Skate (SSN-578) in 1962, in which torpedoes were tested underneath the polar ice pack after the two submarines had rendezvoused at the North Pole.Tales of a Cold War Submariner by Dan Summitt, 2004. Burton Island, , and pushing an iceberg out of the channel in the \\"Silent Land\\" near McMurdo Station, Antarctica, 29 December 1965. US Coast Guard, 1966‚Äì1978 On 15 December 1966, the U.S. Navy transferred the vessel, along with all of its icebreakers, to the United States Coast Guard and it was renumbered WAGB-283. After its transfer, Burton Island was stationed at Long Beach, California and used for icebreaking operations. Starting in 1967 through 1978, Burton Island went on eight different Deep Freeze operations to the Antarctic. In the operations, Burton Island was responsible for creating and maintaining aids to navigation, clearing channels through the ice for supply vessels, laying cables, delivering and dispatching the U.S. Mail at remote stations and vessels, search and rescue, fisheries patrol, law enforcement, and giving dental and medical treatment at remote Native Alaskan communities. In addition to Deep Freeze operations, Burton Island served as a floating platform for scientific surveys and research around Alaska and other isolated polar areas. Burton Island also conducted numerous search and rescue (SAR) missions. From October 1967 to April 1968 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '68. From October 1968 to April 1969 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '69. From November 1969 to April 1970 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '70 and her accompanying icebreaker USCGC Edisto (WAGB-284) was disabled. From November 1970 to April 1971 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '71 and again her accompanying icebreaker USCGC Staten Island (WAGB-278) was disabled. From August to September 1971 she conducted an oceanographic survey along North Slope, Alaska. From February to March 1972 she conducted a scientific survey in Cook Inlet, Alaska. From November 1972 to April 1973 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '73. From June to July 1973 she conducted oceanographic research in Alaskan waters. From November 1974 to April 1975 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '75. From 13 November 1975 to 26 February 1976 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '76. From July to September 1976 she deployed to the Arctic. From 9 November 1976 to 7 April 1977 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '77. During that deployment in December, 1976, she carried out numerous search-and-rescue missions at Wellington, New Zealand, following a torrential downpour. From 9 July 1977 to 8 September 1977 she undertook a cruise to the Arctic Ocean, during which time her crew constructed several radar navigation towers along the north coast of Alaska and conducted gravity surveys of the Arctic Ocean. From 20 November 1977 to 1 April 1978 she participated in Operation Deep Freeze '78. From mid-1977 to 9 May 1978 she was stationed at Naval Supply Center Oakland Oakland, California and used for icebreaking. Decommissioning and sale She was decommissioned on 9 May 1978. An excerpt from a Maritime Administration letter dated 21 November 1995 indicates her ultimate fate: The Maritime Administration sold the vessel by auction under PD-X-1033 dtd. 17 August 1980. The vessel was awarded to Levin Metals Corporation, San Jose, CaliforniaLevin Metals Corporation, 1800 Monterey Highway, San Jose, California 95112 on 7 October 1980, under contract No. MA-9868 for $261,000.00 The \\"Burton Island\\" was scrapped as of 28 April 1982.

The bay is located in Gulf County between Apalachicola and Panama City. Port St. Joe is located on St. Joseph Bay. St. Joseph Bay is bounded on the east by the mainland, on the south by Cape San Blas, and on the west by the St. Joseph Peninsula. The north end of the bay is a relatively narrow opening to the Gulf of Mexico. The bay is approximately long north to south and wide at its widest point. The waters of St. Joseph Bay contain the St. Joseph Bay State Buffer Preserve and the St. Joseph Bay Aquatic Preserve. The St. Joseph Peninsula forms the St. Joseph Peninsula State Park. History The Spanish established Presidio Bah√≠a San Jos√© de Valladares on St. Joseph Bay in 1701. The French established Fort Crevecouer on the shores of St. Joseph Bay opposite St. Joseph Point, the northern end of the St. Joseph Peninsula, in 1717, and captured the Presidio Bah√≠a San Jos√© de Valladares the next year. Under pressure from Spain, the French then abandoned Fort Crevecouer. The Spanish established the Presidio Bah√≠a San Jos√© de Nueva Asturias on St. Joseph Point in 1719, but abandoned it in 1722. The boom town of St. Joseph was founded on the shores of St. Joseph Bay in 1835. The town briefly prospered, but a yellow fever epidemic in 1841 drove most the residents away and the town was soon abandoned. The St. Joseph Bay Light was established on St. Joseph Point in 1838, to serve the new town's port. The light was discontinued in 1847, after the town had been abandoned, and the unused tower was destroyed in a storm in 1851. A new lighthouse, the St. Joseph Light Range Station, was constructed in 1902 on the mainland across from St. Joseph Point, at Beacon Hill. A new town, Port St. Joe, was founded a couple of miles north of the site of the old town of St. Joseph around 1910, when the Apalachicola Northern Railroad build a branch line to the Bay. Wildlife St. Joseph Bay is known in the area for its abundant scallop habitats. Open-harvest season for bay scallops along Florida‚Äôs Gulf coast typically runs from July 1 through September 24.

Publication history Luna first appeared in Fantastic Four #240 (March 1982), and was created by John Byrne. The character has subsequently appeared in a number of ongoing books including The Incredible Hulk,The Incredible Hulk #279 (January 1983) The Avengers,The Avengers #234, 369, 395, Annual #12 (August 1983, December 1993, February 1996, 1983) and Quicksilver,Quicksilver #4 (February 1998) as well as in limited series such as The Vision and the Scarlet Witch,The Vision and the Scarlet Witch #2, 4 (December 1982, February 1983)The Vision and the Scarlet Witch vol. 2, #6 (March 1986) Son of M, and Silent War. Luna appeared as part of the \\"Inhumans\\" entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #6. Fictional character biography The daughter of Quicksilver and Crystal, she is named after the moon, where she was born. Luna is the first child to be born to a mutant and an Inhuman; the genetic markers denoting these subgroups in humanity supposedly \\"cancelled out\\" in her, leaving her a normal human. Quicksilver, aghast at the thought of having a flatscan, human daughter, initially sought to expose her to the Inhumans' mutagenic Terrigen Mists. He was talked out of this by Lockjaw (or possibly an impersonation by Gorgon and Karnak to make their pointThing #3 (September 1983)) who, like the Thing, prompted the idea that the mists could turn her into a monstrosity like them (or the amphibious Triton). Luna was considered an abomination by mutant extremist Exodus, who sought to murder her on several occasions. Luna was protected by the High Evolutionary and his New Men. As seen in flashbacks, Luna and the New Men consider each other family.Quicksilver #7 (May, 1998) Son of M Quicksilver, as viewed from Luna's altered POV post-Terrigen exposure. Art by Roy Allen Martinez. Years later, however, when Luna was six years old, Quicksilver was depowered by the Decimation of mutantkind. Desperate to get his powers back, he exposed himself to the Mists, and subsequently talked Luna into returning to Earth with him, where he exposed her, too. Thanks to the Mists, she can now see the feelings of the people she looks at in terms of colors, as a sort of visual empathy. Having trouble dealing with this, she now must wear shades at all times. Seemingly addicted to the Mist, her continued exposure to the mutagen has apparently enhanced her newfound power to the point of being a full-fledged empath, able to sense, remove, and alter emotions at will. After the events of Son of M, Quicksilver returned her to Crystal. Currently, the Inhumans are treating her addiction to the Mists, although it is unknown how her body will react to her addiction and if she will retain her abilities longer than baseline humans. Silent War In the Silent War miniseries, Luna still has her aura-sensing empathic ability, and is seen using it to defeat Karnak in a training session. She is used to track Terrigen Crystals. Maximus used her to remove the mental shackles that were placed on his ability to use his mind control powers and also free the evil eye powers of Ahura. She regrets that this has allowed Maximus to take control of the Inhumans away from Black Bolt, who appears to have lost his sanity. When asking Black Bolt what she should do about Maximus and her role in his ascendance, Black Bolt opens his mouth to answer her. Secret Invasion Luna is endangered when one member of the invading Skrull army is disguised as one of her playmates.Secret Invasion: Inhumans #1-4 After the Skrulls were repelled from Attilan, Luna was seen with Maximus as Medusa heads into space to look for where the Skrulls are holding Black Bolt.Secret Invasion #3 Dark Reign Luna was present in Attilan when Quicksilver brings the Xerogen Crystals to Medusa on Hala and claimed that a Skrull posed as him and stole the Terrigen Crystals; but he is then confronted by his daughter afterwards. Luna tells her father that she saw through his lie. Bidding Pietro farewell, she told him that she will always love him only because he is her father (and therefore will not expose the truth about him), but she will never respect him again.The Mighty Avengers #31 Recently, when her father (now a member of X-Factor) was confronted in a press conference by Fatale about his actions, and finally acknowledged his actions and his lies, he was later visited by Luna; she was proud of him for owning up to what he did, and told him he had earned her respect back, much to his relief.All-new X-Factor #12 Powers and abilities Luna can read and manipulate the state of nearby beings, including their emotional state, intentions, truthfulness, mental illness, and whether a person is under the mental control of Maximus. These states are represented to her as various cascading colors that she learns to interpret and to change for various effects. Because her powers are essentially some kind of visual empathy they are generally limited to her line of sight. When her empathic powers emerged, her blue-colored eyes turned golden, and because she is forced to wear specialized shades most of the time, it is unknown if her eyes remained in this state. Luna can manipulate these auras to effect a mental manipulation ability. She has been able to release beings from mental shackles that prevented them from using their superhuman powers. Magneto had to ask her not to remove his sense of despair at losing his powers. Luna may be able to sense and track certain energy patterns from far distances as, from the Moon, she could track Terrigen Crystals in various locations on the Earth. However, this ability may be limited to the Terrigen Crystals because of their nature or the long period she spent inhaling Terrigen mists. Luna is able to sense from far distances whenever the crystals are being used and whether they are being used by humans, rather than Inhumans. Other versions In the alternate future of Earth X, Luna has sprouted colorful wings. She is engaged to be married to Ahura, the son of Black Bolt and Medusa. The planned festivities are interrupted by the Inhumans not understanding what Earth has undergone.Earth X #1-3 (April‚ÄìJune 1999) ReferencesExternal links *Luna Maximoff at Marvel.com * Category:Fictional empaths Category:Inhumans Category:Marvel Comics mutants Category:Comics characters introduced in 1982 Category:Fictional hybrids Category:Characters created by John Byrne ","title":"Luna Maximoff"},{"id":"4111712","text":"Krugle delivers continuously updated, federated access to all of the code and technical information in the enterprise.

The weaver uses threads from the pale colored layers, that have dried out for a day, to make a bag. A design pattern is finalized. The weaver then boils the threads to be used with water and dye sets the bag's colors. Now the weaving begins. Two single threads are twined to form one strong thread. Many such threads are woven.

The show is Nicktoons Network's first original half-hour series, bought during the same period as other Animation Collective series. The series premiered on February 25, 2006 and ended on September 20, 2008. 52 episodes were produced. Plot The series is a parody of Japanese anime, featuring a young American actor named Mikey whose appearance is styled after Western cartoons, and travels to Japan to star in a tokusatsu show called LillyMu, where his anime-styled co-stars represent common anime clich√©s. Each episode follows a specific formula. A typical episode starts with the cast filming a LilyMu segment, but the take is ruined, sometimes revealing the conflict that the characters deal with through the rest of the episode, with a minor subplot running beneath the main plot. After the problem is resolved, the LilyMu segment will be shot again and successfully completed the second time, often rewritten to incorporate whatever lesson was learned during the main story. Deep into season 2, Kappa Mikey has stopped showing a LilyMu sequence at the end of an episode whenever it would make the episode too long, when the characters are in their LilyMu uniforms enough as it is, or when they successfully film a sequence without any mistakes before the ending. Production The show's title is a play on the word kappamaki, a type of sushi. It is suggested that the show was the inspiration for naming the title character \\"Mikey\\" and used the prefix \\"kappa\\". Like Mikey, who is a \\"fish out of water\\" in Japan, the kappa itself is a water demon creature who can live on land. The kappas first appeared on this show in the episode \\"Mikey, Kappa\\" on August 5, 2007, where the origin of the title was explained. Coincidentally, Mikey also shares his name with the actor who supplies his voice. Kappa Mikey is different from other cartoons produced at the turn of the 21st century, in that the property was owned by the studio instead of an agency, the animation was not outsourced and the episodes were written by a full-time staff. After producing Internet-based projects and television spots, the series became Animation Collective's first television series. The series was produced in New York City starting from the summer of 2005.Animation World Magazine Production for the two seasons wrapped in September 2007. Schwarz conceived the series in 2000, when he was running Rumpus toys, a toy design company in New York City, but they folded before any storyboarding could commence. They resurfaced years later as Animation Collective, and produced an early test pilot for a pitch to MTV Networks, where the character designs and backgrounds resembled more like those found in Adult Swim series Perfect Hair Forever, and the humor was also more adult-oriented. Much of the current cast was voicing their characters even this early in production. MTV declined the deal, and Nickelodeon eventually picked up the project. The series was tweaked heavily in order to be aimed at a younger audience. Voice talents were usually local, and its audio was recorded at Manhattan-based NYAV Post, which Michael Sinterniklaas owns. Larry Schwarz, along with the other executive producers, oversaw all phases of production, but only had writing credits on the pilot episode, \\"Mikey Impossible\\" and \\"A Christmas Mikey\\". All the episodes were directed by Sergei Aniskov. The instrumental score was composed by John Angier, who also wrote the lyrics to \\"The Recycling Song\\", \\"Ori and Yori's Hits\\", \\"Living With Mikey\\", \\"How Did We Get Here?\\" and the songs from \\"The Karaoke Episode\\". The series was animated in Adobe Flash, with some moments of CGI rendered in Maya. To further emphasize the contrast in animation styles, one group of animators was assigned to the anime characters, and another group was in charge of Mikey and the other American characters. The vehicles on LilyMu and around Tokyo, as well as the weapons, the Gonard balloon, Pirate King's ship, the Karaoke Genie Machine, etc., were created in Maya and exported into Flash using the Toon Filter. The backgrounds were modeled in Maya, and texture, details, and clouds were added in Photoshop. Some of the backgrounds were inspired by actual locations in Tokyo. The show's anime-style characters perform with large comedic overuses of face faults, such as a face and/or body turning into an exaggerated general appearance, or becoming much smaller. This allowed animators to have more control over how a character looks and acts than on many other Flash shows, and they did not always have to be on-model. The show uses clich√©s common to anime, including the sweat drop, lines over the eyes or no eyes at all, big heads, flaming eyes and bodies becoming smaller. Sometimes Mikey will try to do these things, which was one of the show's running gags, but cannot due to being drawn in an American style.

In 2008, the Animation Collective site advertised a second DVD that was scheduled be released sometime later that year. However, the announcement was removed from the website, leaving the exact release date to be unknown. The DVD was intended to include the first season in its entirety, with DVD extras, and would have been considered more of an \\"official\\" volume than the last one. No further announcement has been made as the status of this DVD. As of 2009, this release is shelved.

In a Fitness contest (the older of the two disciplines), female competitors showcase their physiques (which are noticeably less massive than bodybuilders') while performing a demanding, time-limited, aerobic/dance routine. In a Figure contest, the most important attributes are a curvaceous-yet-trim body, and facial beauty; however, the physique guidelines are similar to a Fitness pageant's, and many contestants move back and forth between the two disciplines. The Figure division emerged on the bodybuilding scene when the numbers for Fitness pageant competitions started to dwindle. Typically, fitness and figure competitions are held as part of the larger-drawing bodybuilding contests. History Women's fitness competitions did not start until the 1980s. In previous years it was uncommon for women to compete in muscle building competition. Beauty pageants were the main way for women to compete. Women's body building is a relatively new cultural phenomenon, and has shown a significant increase in popularity since the 1980s. Body building has traditionally been seen as a male-appropriate activity, and various authors have documented the struggle faced by pioneering women body builders as they entered the competitive body building world in the 1970s. Gold's Gym is said to have prided itself on being ‚Äòovary free‚Äô until the late 1970s.Grogan, Sarah, et al. \\"Femininity and Muscularity: Accounts of Seven Women Body Builders.\\" Journal of Gender Studies, vol. 13, no. 1, Mar. 2004, p. 49. EBSCOhost, library.se.edu:2048/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=edb&AN;=13073262&site;=eds- live . The first women's Fitness competition was produced by Wally Boyko in 1985 at the National Fitness trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada; it included a swimsuit round, an athletic routine, and an evening gown segment. Louis Zwick, then the producer of American Muscle Magazine (a magazine-format, bodybuilding TV show on ESPN), produced and aired a segment on the pageant. The number of contests was proliferating, and Zwick himself launched Fitness America (now Fitness Universe) in 1989 to capitalize on the trend. The International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness soon followed suit, holding its own, sanctioned fitness pageant‚ÄîFitness Olympia‚Äîin 1995. The first women's Figure competition was the NPC (the major sanctioning body for would-be professional bodybuilders and organized amateur bodybuilding) Figure Nationals held in 2001 at Borough of Manhattan Community College's Performing Arts Center, in New York City's Tribeca section. It was a qualifier and precursor to the 2003 IFBB Figure Olympia, held in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Fitness Universe organization launched their own Figure division in 2005. Categories=Fitness competition A fitness competitor during her show A typical fitness competition consists of a swimsuit round and a routine round. In the swimsuit round, the competitors wear two-piece swimsuits and high-heeled shoes, presenting their physiques with a series of quarter- or half-turns toward the judges and audience. Physique guidelines for fitness competitions typically suggest a small amount of muscular mass; clear separations between muscle groups (but, no visible striations); and, leanness. The swimsuit must cover at least fifty percent of the gluteus maximus muscle; no thongs or G-strings are allowed. The routine round requires a physically active stage performance; most competitors attempt aerobic, dance, and/or gymnastic routines. Fitness contests sanctioned by the International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB) are the Fitness Olympia and the Fitness International. Fitness contests sanctioned by Wally Boyko Productions are the National Fitness Sanctioning Body (NFSB) Ms. Fitness USA and the International Fitness Sanctioning Body (IFSB) Ms. Fitness World. Fitness contests sanctioned by the Fitness Universe organization are the Fitness America Pageant and the Fitness Universe Pageant. Figure competition During figure competition show Figure competition is a newer sub-category of fitness contests. Figure shows exclude the routine round common to fitness shows. The competitors are judged solely on muscular symmetry and definition; as in fitness shows, muscle size is downplayed. Figure competitions appeal most to women who want to compete in a body competition, but wish to avoid fitness shows' additional athletic and creative demands (the routine round), or bodybuilding's demands for heavy muscle mass. A typical figure competition includes two rounds, though this varies by organization. In the symmetry round, the competitors appear on stage in high- heeled shoes and a one-piece swimsuit in a side-by-side line that faces the judges. They execute a series of quarter-turns to the right, allowing the judges to view and compare them from all sides for symmetry, presentation, and other aesthetic qualities such as skin tone, hair, make-up, and stylishness of clothing. In the next round (the group comparisons), competitors return in high heels and a two-piece bathing suit, executing a series of quarter-turns. At this stage, they are judged more critically against the others for conditioning, leanness, and how \\"feminine\\" and \\"athletic\\" (as opposed to brawny) their muscularity is. Included in either of these rounds, or perhaps just the evening show, the competitors come out individually on stage for a model walk where they are judged on presentation, gracefulness, confidence, poise, and professionalism.NPC Figure Competition RulesIFBB Competition Rules Figure contests sanctioned by the International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness (IFBB) are the Figure Olympia and the Figure International. Figure contests sanctioned by the Fitness Universe organization is the Figure Universe Pageant. Bikini competition Bikini competition was created as a category with much less emphasis on muscularity to accommodate even more women into the world of physique competitions and IFBB recognized bikini competition as an independent competition category on 7 November 2010. Rapidly growing, bikini category looks for lean and firm physique and \\"competitors are scored on proportion, symmetry, balance, shape and skin tone\\". Women that are not willing to be as muscular as bodybuilders can still participate in bikini competition. The tan that they have is also a point that should be taken into consideration when it comes to participating at a bikini competition. The first Bikini Olympia was introduced in 2010, since then it has grown to become the largest and most popular division on the fitness stage.. The Wellness Category Created by Gustavo Costa, then President of IFBB-Rio (Brasil), being one of the most contested categories in competitions, it won worldwide recognition when it was made official by the IFBB . Physique competition Women's physique category has been created to give a platform for women who enjoy weight training, competing, and contest preparation. Competitors should display a toned, athletic physique showcasing femininity, muscle tone, and beauty/flow of physique. The following are examples of common terms used in the bodybuilding industry. These words can be helpful to assess what should not be descriptive to the physiques being judged in women's physique: ripped, shredded, peeled, striated, dry, diced, hard, vascular, grainy, massive, thick, and dense. While all types of physiques will be considered when it comes to height, weight, structure, etc. Excessive muscularity should be scored down accordingly. Women's physique competitors should have the overall aesthetics and look that is found in figure with a little more overall muscularity.‚ÄúOfficial NPC Women's Physique Division.‚Äù NPC News Online, National Physique Committee, npcnewsonline.com/official-npc-womens-physique- division/. Women's physique categories are broken down into two parts, a group comparison and an individual performance routine. During group comparisons competitors will be directed through a series of poses that can consist of any of the following: quarter turns, front or rear double biceps with open hands, left or right-side chest with front leg and arms extended, left or right-side triceps with front leg extended, hands over head abdominals.‚ÄúWomen's Physique Guidelines.‚Äù OCB Online, ocbonline.com/guidelines-womensphysique.php. In the individual performance routine contestants perform a small choreographed routine to music. Not only do they have to look good on stage they have to show their personality on stage depending on the physique competition some will require you to wear a one-piece bikini or a two-piece bikini. Some competitions depending on the organization for instance NPC or IFBB will require the use of high heels or bare feet. Along with the use of jewelry or no jewelry, physique competitors also have to worry about their tan, makeup and hair. Nutrition According to personal trainers and nutritionist, nutrition is one of the most important factors to muscle building. Without the proper nutrients and hydration that your muscles need to grow you will not see much progress with just weight training. There are several nutrients that you need which include protein, carbohydrates, and fats. Proteins, are one of the most important nutrients for muscle building. Protein provides the amino-acid building blocks for muscle growth. Carbohydrates are also an important factor when it comes to muscle building. Carbohydrates provide a valuable source of calories for building a bigger physique. Plus, if trainers do not have enough glycogen, they will not have the energy to train hard to grow muscle mass, so quality carbs are necessary to fuel intense workouts. Dietary fats are important because it promotes healthy blood flow along with healthy skin and hair. More calorie dense than protein or carbohydrates, fat is a surefire way to help meet your caloric needs. It is also necessary to keep testosterone levels elevated, which makes it easier to pack on muscle. Not only do you have to eat right, you also have to make sure you stay hydrated. Water is a critical component of your mass-gaining diet because it helps maintain muscle fullness and helps the body properly use all the calories you are supplying it.Kadey, Matthew. \\"The Big 12.\\" Muscle & Performance, vol. 4, no. 12, Dec. 2012, pp. 47-52.

It is easier for a male to gain muscle mass than for women to gain muscle due to the amounts of testosterone that males have. Steroids are illegal unless they are prescribed by Doctors. If they are not prescribed by Doctors, steroids are usually smuggled into the United States from places like Mexico and European countries where a prescription is not required. The [anabolic‚Äìandrogenic steroids (AASs)] are a family of hormones that contain the innate male hormone, testosterone, and a group of synthetic testosterone derivatives. These medicines are widely misused by men and rarely women to increase muscle content and body fat lose. When female athletes use these substances, they have to make sure they know how much exactly to take as mistake can lead to a lifelong side effect. Steroids in females can have a great amount of side effects including liver disorder, enlargement of clitoris, and a masculine look. Another major effect that can occur is if you are not eating the right nutrients or working out enough you can gain a lot of weight from the misuse of steroids. In women, AASs may interrupt ovarian function. Chronic intense physical activity leads to menstrual irregularities and, in severe cases, to the female athletes‚Äô triad (such as low energy intake, menstrual disturbance and low bone mass), making it difficult to abandon sports effects and AASs. Acne, hirsutism and deepening of the tone of voice are major outcomes of AASs misapplication.Navidinia, Masoumeh and A. S. L.

Biography La vie de la mere Catherine de Saint Augustin by Ragueneau, 1671 He was born in Paris and died in the same city. He is sometimes confused with his elder brother Fran√ßois, also a Jesuit. Father Fran√ßois Ragueneau accompanied Father Charles Lalemant who was returning to Canada in 1628. Their vessel was captured by Kirke who was then blockading the St. Lawrence and he was sent as a prisoner to England. It cannot be determined whether Francois ever did visit the Canadian missions.Pouliot, L√©on. ‚ÄúRagueneau, Paul\\", Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 1, University of Toronto/Universit√© Laval, 2003‚Äì Paul Ragueneau became a novice in the Society of Jesus in 1626.Lindsay, Lionel. \\"Paul Ragueneau.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 12. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 14 January 2018 From 1628 to 1632 he taught at the Coll√®ge in Bourges after which he furthered his religious training at the College of La Fl√®che. From there, he went to Quebec in 1636. Upon arriving in Quebec, he was almost immediately sent to the Huron mission where he worked under the instruction of Fathers Jean de Br√©beuf and J√©r√¥me Lalemant for eight years. In 1645 he became superior of the Huron mission. During his time as superior, a number of his missionaries met their deaths, the first being Jean de Lalande in October 1646. They became known as the Canadian Martyrs. He remained at his post on St. Mary's on the Wye until 1649, when persuaded by the Huron leaders to join the fugitives on St. Joseph's island (1649). After a bloody defeat, followed by the massacres of Fathers No√´l Chabanel and Charles Garnier, Ragueneau, yielding to the entreaties of the few whom famine, pestilence, and the fury of the Iroquois had spared, led the small band of 400 survivors, the remnants of a nation of ten thousand, to their final refuge, Quebec, after a long and perilous journey. Ragueneau wrote the \\"Relations of the Hurons\\" of 1648-9, 1649‚Äì50, 1650-1, and 1651-2 which describes the destruction of the mission. In 1650, he became vice-rector of the College of Quebec, and superior of the Canadian mission. In 1656, Ragueneau was assigned to the residence at Trois-Rivi√®res. In 1657, he left for Sainte-Marie-de-Ganentaa. He was part of the times that saw the departure of Fathers Chaumonot, Le Moyne, and other missionaries. This first attempt at an organized apostolate among the Iroquois had failed. In 1662 he returned to France and remained there as procurator of the mission. Ragueneau died in Paris September 3, 1680.Corrigan, Michael. \\"Register of the Clergy Laboring in the Archdiocese of New York\\", Historical Records and Studies, Vol. 1, United States Catholic Historical Society, 1899 p. 25 The Parish Municipality of Ragueneau in Quebec, Canada, is named after him.

It was concluded in Warsaw on 16 May 2005. Most notable amongst its provisions are the three new offences which it defines: Public Provocation to Commit a \\"Terrorist Offence\\"; Solicitation of Persons to Commit \\"Terrorist Offences\\"; and Provision of Training For \\"Terrorist Offences\\". Parties are required to establish these offences in their national legal systems. However the obligation only applies in respect of behaviour where there is an international nexus of some sort. A \\"terrorist offence\\" is defined as any of the offences defined under the 12 existing international conventions on terrorism presently in force.Adrian Hunt, \\"The Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism\\" (2006) European Public Law 603. __TOC__ The Incitement Offence The most controversial part of the CECPT is its definition of Public Provocation to Commit a Terrorist Offence. Article 5 of the CECPT defines this as intentionally distributing \\"a message to the public, with the intent to incite the commission of a 'terrorist offence', where such conduct, whether or not directly advocating terrorist offences, causes a danger that one or more terrorist offences may be committed.\\" This is the first attempt in an international law context to define \\"incitement\\" to terrorism. It is controversial most notably because of the inclusion of ‚Äúindirect‚Äù incitement. The limits of this concept are not defined in the CECPT. Article 12 of the CECPT requires parties to implement, and apply the offence in a way which is compatible with the Right to freedom of Expression as recognised in International Law [See Article 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and Article 19 of the UN's International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ]. There is some evidence that in a purported fulfilment of their obligations under the CECPT, States are going further than the CECPT and the relevant Human Rights principles would require or permit. See for example the British Terrorism Act 2006, section 1. Signatures and ratifications The CECPT is open for signature by the member states of the Council of Europe, the European Community, and by non-member states which have participated in its elaboration. It came into force on 1 June 2007 in Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, and Ukraine; as of July 2016 it has been ratified by 35 states. A further 10 states and the European Union have signed but not ratified the Convention.

He was Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies (1830‚Äì1833), commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army, Minister of Colonies, and Minister of State. He was an officer in the Military William Order. Biography Johannes van den Bosch was born on 2 February 1780 in Herwijnen in the Dutch Republic (the present-day Netherlands), to the physician Johannes van den Bosch Sr. and his wife Adriana Poningh. J. graaf van den Bosch, Parlement & Politiek. Retrieved on 18 January 2015. Van den Bosch enrolled in the army of the Batavian Republic in 1797 and was, at his own request, sent to Batavia in the Dutch East Indies as a lieutenant a year later. At the time, the emphasis was put on asserting commercial interest, and Dutch control over the Indonesian archipelago was limited. As an adjutant, Van den Bosch remained close to the consecutive Governor-Generals, and was involved in the transformation from trade colonialism to territorial colonial expansion. In 1808, he had a conflict with the new Governor-General, Herman Willem Daendels, after which he was honourably discharged from service at the rank of colonel. He and his family were sent back to Europe in 1810. Second wife and son of Count van den Bosch by Cornelis Kruseman. On his way back to the Netherlands, Van den Bosch was captured by the British and remained a captive until 1812. Upon arriving in the Netherlands, he joined the provisional government tasked with restoring the authority of the Prince of Orange, William Frederick. He was recommissioned in the army as a colonel and, in the name of the Prince of Orange, captured Utrecht and Naarden. In 1818, Van den Bosch was involved in the establishment of the Society of Humanitarianism, under the auspices of Prince Frederick, and was put on inactive in the military in order to focus on the society. The society considered labour to be the only means to combat poverty. In Drenthe, it founded the 'free colonies' of Frederiksoord, Willemsoord and Wilhelminaoord, where the poor from big cities would learn to care for themselves in a disciplined manner. In 1827, Van den Bosch was tasked with restoring Dutch control over the West Indies as commissioner-general. He left the society and arrived on Cura√ßao in December that year, and would stay in the colony for eight months. During this period, he took several initiatives concerning trade and banking, focussed on stimulating economic activity and scope of the colony. Among other things, he introduced a regulation which would make the Constitution of the Netherlands apply to the colony as well, and used it to attempt to improve the living conditions of slaves. Only shortly after his return in 1828, Van den Bosch rose to the rank of lieutenant general and was appointed Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies. In this capacity, he is most famous for the introduction of the cultivation system in 1830. This system forced Javanese farmers to use a fifth of their farmland for export goods such as coffee, sugar and indigo. Van den Bosch returned to the Netherlands on 18 May 1834 and was appointed Minister of Colonies on 30 May. As Minister, he demanded increasingly high financial results from the colonies, often to the detriment of the interest of individual farmers and slaves. In 1839, he received criticism from the House of Representatives for the opaqueness of his policy on loans between the government and the Netherlands Trading Society. Van den Bosch voluntarily stepped down from office on 1 January 1840, upon which he was granted the title Count van den Bosch by royal decree, as well as the honourable title of Minister of State. He entered the House of Representatives for South Holland in 1842 and would remain there until his death. Count van den Bosch died on 28 January 1844 at his estate in The Hague, as a result of a short disease.

Debuting on May 6, 2003 as Rome Is Burning, it was originally a weekly show in primetime at 7:00 PM ET on Tuesday nights on ESPN. After a short hiatus in 2004, it returned with a new name, Jim Rome Is Burning, and a late-night Thursday timeslot. In February 2005, JRIB became a daily program airing each afternoon at 4:30 PM in between NFL Live and Around the Horn. After ESPN expanded NFL Live to sixty minutes, JRIB moved to ESPN2 as part of its new afternoon lineup on September 12, 2011. It was produced by Mandt Bros. Productions in association with ESPN Original Entertainment and taped in Los Angeles as opposed to ESPN's Bristol, Connecticut headquarters. This was due to his daily radio commitment. The show ended on January 27, 2012 with the announcement that Rome had agreed to a contract with CBS, CBS Sports Network, and Showtime. Outside of some 4:3 non-essential game footage camera angles used in play analysis during NFL Matchup, Rome is Burning was the final program in the ESPN family of networks outside ESPN Classic to be produced in standard definition and never upgraded to high definition. Segments * Rome Is Burning: Rome gave takes on four or five of the top sports-related stories of the day and always opened with the statement \\"Here's what I am burning on.\\" * Alone with Rome: Interview segment with current and former athletes, coaches, sports writers/columnists, and celebrities. * The Forum: Rome was joined by a reporter, sports figure, or entertainer, usually for an entire week, to discuss various sports topics. Until 2011 there were usually two panelists joining Rome for The Forum. * Correspondents: Generally, a player gave a tour of one of their team's sports facilities or took Rome and the TV audience through a normal day in the life of a sports athlete. The correspondents included David Wright, Nick Swisher, Ty Lawson, Tony Gonzalez, Delonte West and Dont√© Stallworth. For special occasions such as the NFL Draft, there was a group of correspondents. The players who appeared as correspondents were said to attain good \\"JRIB karma\\" afterwards. * Final Burn: The last segment of the show, in which Rome gave one or two final takes. He then thanked the show's guests and signed off with \\"I will see you next time. I am out.\\" These segments almost always ran in the above order, with Correspondents pieces about once per week. On rare occasions, if the Forum guest was late to the studio or the remote location, that segment would air after the Forum. On other occasions, the segments were in a different order by design. A show might end with a Correspondents piece instead of a Final Burn. * U Smack 2 (formerly known as Smack Back): Rome responded to phone calls and e-mails. Discontinued in late 2005.

This mountain range is famous for its abundance of medicinal and aromatic plants, some of which are used to make the herbero liquor. Herbero is often found in a regional cocktail called mesclaet. The drink originated during The Moorish Occupation of Spain, when the Moors brought distilling technology to the peninsula. Herbero is obtained from the distillation or maceration of plants collected in the mountain range with a grain alcohol solution with between 22% and 40% alcoholic content. The color of the resulting liquor may be transparent, or it may vary from yellow to clear green to red. The plants used in the production of herbero include at least four of the following: sage, chamomile, pennyroyal, lemon verbena, the root of the blessed thistle, peppermint, cattail, fennel, anise, melissa, agrimony, savory, felty germander, thyme, and French lavender.

It is sealed by the secondary tympanic membrane (round window membrane), which vibrates with opposite phase to vibrations entering the inner ear through the oval window. It allows fluid in the cochlea to move, which in turn ensures that hair cells of the basilar membrane will be stimulated and that audition will occur. Structure The round window is situated below (inferior to) and a little behind (posterior to) the oval window, from which it is separated by a rounded elevation, the promontory. It is located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped depression (the round window niche) and, in the macerated bone, opens into the cochlea of the internal ear; in the fresh state it is closed by a membrane, the secondary tympanic membrane (Latin: membrana tympani secundaria, or membrana fenestrae cochleae) or round window membrane, which is a complex saddle point shape. The visible central portion is concave (curved inwards) toward the tympanic cavity and convex (curved outwards) toward the cochlea; but towards the edges, where it is hidden in the round window niche, it curves the other way. This membrane consists of three layers: * an external, or mucous, derived from the mucous lining of the tympanic cavity; * an internal, from the lining membrane of the cochlea; * and an intermediate, or fibrous layer. The membrane vibrates with opposite phase to vibrations entering the cochlea through the oval window as the fluid in the cochlea is displaced when pressed by the stapes at the oval window. This ensures that hair cells of the basilar membrane will be stimulated and that audition will occur. Both the oval and round windows are about the same size, approximately . The entrance to the round window niche is often much smaller than this.  Function  The stapes bone transmits movement to the oval window. As the stapes footplate moves into the oval window, the round window membrane moves out, and this allows movement of the fluid within the cochlea, leading to movement of the cochlear inner hair cells and thus hearing. If the round window were to be absent or rigidly fixed (as can happen in some congenital abnormalities), the stapes footplate would be pushing incompressible fluid against the unyielding walls of the cochlea. It would therefore not move to any useful degree leading to a hearing loss of about 60dB. This is, unsurprisingly, the same as for conditions where the stapes itself is fixed, such as otosclerosis.  Imaging  The round window is located within the mesotympanum, at the posterior extremity of the basal turn of the cochlea. The oval windows is also located within the mesotympanum, opening at the inferior and lateral part of the vestibule. Both can be seen readily on CT.  Clinical significance The round window sometimes fails to develop correctly and causes the hearing loss mentioned above. Unfortunately round window malformations are often associated with other ear malformations and the hearing loss can be much more severe. Some types of ear surgery (now generally abandoned) used to leave the round window open to the outside world and covered over the oval window. Sound pressure therefore hit the round window but was shielded from the oval window. It therefore travelled \\"backwards\\" around the cochlea but still gave useful hearing as the hair cells were still deflected in the same way. The round window is often used as an approach for cochlear implant surgery. It has also recently been used as a site to place middle ear implantable hearing aid transducers. This work has been publicised by Prof. Vittorio Colletti in Verona.

Early life and education He was born on 27 March 1865 in Mount Calm, Texas to the Reverend Andrew Carrol, a Southern Baptist minister and Evelyn Bennett. Graves attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated on 12 June 1889. Marriage Graves married Katherine Pauline \\"Kate\\" Boyd, daughter of William Lang and Augusta Josephine (n√©e Merriam) Boyd, at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Cheyenne, Wyoming,Certificate of Marriage. Arapaho County, Colorado. County Clerk Jos H Smith. Filed: 12 February 1891. on 9 February 1891. Katherine was the niece of his commanding officer, Henry C. Merriam. Military career He served in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in the Philippines until 1902. He fought at the Battle of Caloocan as a company commander during the insurrection. He was the assistant chief of the Army General Staff. In 1918, he was given command of the 8th Infantry Division and sent to Siberia under direct orders from President Woodrow Wilson. He landed on September 1, 1918. His orders were to remain strictly apolitical amidst a politically turbulent situation, as a result, he found himself constantly at odds with his Allied peers, the State Department, and various Russian groups. Given some 7,000 soldiers in what was called the American Expeditionary Forces (A.E.F.), he settled on the idea of making sure the Trans-Siberian railroad stayed operational and brought in a number of railroad experts to run the railway. His troops did not intervene in the Russian Civil War despite strong pressure brought on him to help the White army of Admiral Kolchak. Early on, Graves developed a strong distaste for Kolchak and his government. Graves thought that the British, French, and Japanese forces in Siberia were all following self-serving political ambitions beyond the stated goals of the Allies, which were to protect supplies provided by the powers to their erstwhile Tsarist allies and to provide for the safe conduct of foreign allied troops, primarily Czechs, who were to exit Russia via Vladivostok. Graves believed, correctly, that the British and French were trying to suppress Bolshevik forces (thought by some to be the result of German provocateurs). He also believed (again correctly) that the Japanese had plans to annex parts of Eastern Siberia (the Amur region, east of Lake Baikal). The Japanese deployed an estimated 72,000 soldiers‚Äîsome 6 times the authorized troop level of 12,000 set by the Allies. U.S. forces operated the Trans-Siberian railroad for almost two years, while bandits roamed the Siberian countryside and the political situation turned chaotic. The U.S. military did accomplish its main objective and the entire Czech Legion was evacuated out of Russia via Vladivostok. The last U.S. soldiers left Siberia April 1, 1920. Historian Benson Bobrick wrote of Graves: \\"In the whole sad debacle, he may have been the only honorable man.\\"Benson Bobrick, East of the Sun: The Conquest and Settlement of Siberia (Heinemann, 1992: ), p. 398. General Graves was promoted to the rank of major general on 11 July 1925, and retired from the army in 1928. He then wrote a book about his time in Siberia, entitled America's Siberian Adventure 1918-20.General William S. Graves, America's Siberian Adventure (1918-1920)Graves, William Sidney.

He also was responsible for the radio serial I Love a Mystery. A radio legend, he experimented with television and published three novels. Morse is considered by many to be one of the best radio scriptwriters. Early life In 1901, Carlton was born in Jennings, Louisiana, to George and Ora Morse. In 1906, his family relocated to a fruit ranch at Talent, Oregon, and when Morse was 16, they moved to Sacramento, California. After graduating from high school in Sacramento, Morse went to the University of California from 1919 to 1922 but did not graduate. Instead, he dropped out and returned to Sacramento, beginning a career as a journalist with the Sacramento Union. Journalism career From 1922 to 1928, Morse was employed at the Sacramento Union, the San Francisco Illustrated Daily Herald, The Seattle Times, Vancouver Columbian, Portland Oregonian and The San Francisco Bulletin. When the Bulletin was absorbed into the San Francisco Call in 1929, Morse lost his job, soon after marrying his first wife, Patricia DeBall. Though The Seattle Times offered him another job, he declined. This was to mark the beginning of his career in radio. Radio After losing his newspaper job, Morse brought several scripts he had written throughout the 1920s to an interview with NBC. He soon was offered a job at KGO, the San Francisco outlet of NBC's Blue Network, and began his radio career scripting House of Myths. Morse began work on NBC Mystery Serial, which included such episodes as \\"Captain Post: Crime Specialist\\" and \\"Case of the One-eyed Parrot\\". Other mysteries scripted by Morse included The Witch of Endor, The City of the Dead, Captain Post: Crime Specialist, The Game Called Murder and Dead Men Prowl. He also did four programs based on San Francisco Police Department files: Chinatown Squad, Barbary Coast Nights, Killed in Action and To the Best of Their Ability. Morse worked closely with San Francisco Police Chief William J. Quinn, who narrated all four series. Morse's major successes were One Man's Family, and I Love a Mystery. One Man's Family began in 1932, with I Love A Mystery following in 1939. The two series were almost polar opposites; \\"One Man's Family\\" was a daily soap opera, targeted at housewives, and \\"I Love a Mystery\\" was an adventure serial for adolescents and lovers of the macabre. Both are regarded by radio historians as two of the all-time best radio serials. I Love a Mystery was a tremendous hit and many episodes still offer chills to modern listeners. The original series was broadcast from 1939 to 1942 on the NBC Blue Network and then had one more season (1943‚Äì44) on CBS. It was later revived on the Mutual Broadcasting System from 1949 through 1953. The original run was broadcast from Hollywood, and the revival originated from New York City. Morse created and wrote the soap opera Family Skeleton, which ran on CBS radio in 1953-1954. Additional radio credits *Chinatown Tales *Musical Miniatures *Illustrated Tales *Split Second Tales *House of Myths *Adventures by Morse *I Love Adventure (adaptations of stories from \\"I Love a Mystery\\") *His Honor the Barber *The Family Skeleton Television Morse was also a pioneer in television as well. He was part of Slice of Life, the first television drama series aired on Los Angeles' television station, KFI. Morse brought One Man's Family to television (1949‚Äì52), years before it left the airwaves with the end of the Golden Age of Radio. Morse brought a revision of Slice of Life to network television with the title Mixed Doubles. He was producer, director, and writer for the situation comedy, which ran on NBC August through October in 1949. He also had an unsuccessful soap opera, Kitty Foyle in 1958. Later life Morse eventually retired from radio/TV in order to write novels from his home, named Seven Stones. Three of his books, Killer at the Wheel, A Lavish of Sin and Stuff the Lady's Hatbox were based on I Love a Mystery. In 1984, Morse's first wife Patricia died. Later in life, Morse copyrighted his scripts and novels. He was a member of San Francisco's Bohemian Club, and he attended many conventions held in his honor. Before his death in 1993, Morse founded the Morse Family Trust. He is survived by his second wife, Millie Morse. Recognition Morse has a star in the Radio section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame; it is located in front of 6445 Hollywood Boulevard. Papers The Library of Congress houses the Carlton Morse Copyright Script Collection. Located in the library's Recorded Sound Section of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, the collection includes 47 scripts from I Love a Mystery, four scripts from Adventures by Morse, and 13 scripts from I Love Adventure.

Some traditional teachers in China do not regard Dong as the founder, though, but merely as the first identified transmitter of Baguazhang knowledge to the wider public. In their opinion, prior to Dong, Baguazhang teaching was conducted behind closed doors from one Taoist to another within the Taoist sect.Liang Shou-yu, Yang Jwing-Ming, Wu Wen-Ching, ‚ÄúBaguazhang: Emei Baguazhang Theory and Applications‚Äù 1996.Frank Allen, Tina Chunna Zhang, ‚ÄúThe Whirling Circles of Ba Gua Zhang: The Art and Legends of the Eight Trigram Palm 2007‚Äù. There are no historical evidence of practicing Baguazhang among the Taoists prior to the modern era, however. Biography He was born on 13 October 1797 or 1813 in Zhu village, Ju Jia Wu Township, Wen'an County, Hebei Province, China. As a child and young man he intensely trained in the martial arts of his village. The arts were probably Shaolin-based and may have included Bafanshan (a possible precursor to Fanziquan), Hongquan, Xingmenquan, and Jingangquan. These were the arts being taught in and around Dong‚Äôs village at this time. Alternatively, Dong is sometimes said to have learned and practiced Erlangquan, Luohanquan, or other arts. His family is thought to have been so poor, at some point around 1853, Dong left Hebei Province to seek work elsewhere. By many accounts he is described as spending his youth travelling, penniless, and often getting in trouble. But he, even by his own claims, continued to study martial arts intensely during his travels. Where, by whom, and what he was taught, varies depending on the source. But it is generally accepted that, during this time, Dong studied Taoist training methods that included some kind of circle walking practice. He synthesized his previous experience with his village arts, what he had learned in his travels, and his Taoist studies to create a unique art originally called Zhuanzhang (Turning Palms). Zhuanzhang in later years became called Baguazhang. Around 1864 Dong arrived in Beijing and was hired as a servant at the residence of the Prince Su. Later Prince Su gave him the job of tax collector. Dong and his top student Yin Fu went to Mongolia to collect taxes, where he spent ten years. Upon his return he left the prince's employ and began to teach publicly, giving up all other occupations to fully devote himself to developing and teaching Baguazhang. The nature of what he taught is generally disputed. Some believe that he consistently taught only the first three of eight palms (Single Change Palm, Double Change Palm and Smooth Body Palm) and that he would vary the last five depending on the individuals‚Äô previous martial arts experience. Others believe that he taught considerably more material. It was also in his public teaching period that the art was given the name Baguazhang (Eight tri-gram palm). Baguazhang became popular in Beijing and surrounding areas. In his later years he was poor and lived with Yin Fu's student Ma Gui. Ma owned a lumber yard and Dong lived on the premises. He died on 25 October 1882 in Beijing. By the late 19th century, Baguazhang had become a well-known fighting style in Beijing and northern China, and Dong Haichuan and his students became famous. This gave rise to many fictitious stories and written pulp novels which were adopted as fact. Students Dong taught Baguazhang to several highly regarded martial artists, notably Fu Zhensong, Yin Fu, Ma Gui, Cheng Tinghua and Liang Zhenpu. Some of these students' names are recorded on his grave.

It was founded in 1987 by Ann Rabson, Gaye Adegbalola and Earlene Lewis. Lewis separated from the band in 1992 and was replaced by Andra Faye. The group then featured Rabson on piano, vocals and guitar, Adegbalola on vocals and guitar, and Faye on vocals, bass, mandolin, violin and guitar. Saffire's music was a combination of serious blues songs and comedic novelty songs. They covered original songs (such as \\"Do Your Duty\\" by Wesley 'Sox' Wilson, \\"You Got to Know How\\" by Sippie Wallace & Jack Viertel, and \\"Don't You Tell Me\\"), as well as the music of blueswomen who had inspired them, such as Big Mama Thornton, Ida Cox and Koko Taylor. Their music, both comedic and serious, tends to deal with feminist themes, which has made them popular outside of traditional blues circles. Saffire was the first acoustic band to be signed by Alligator Records. Their song \\"Middle Aged Blues Boogie,\\" written by Adegbalola, was named best original song at the W.C. Handy Awards (now the Blues Music Awards) in 1990. Saffire has shared the stage with B.B. King, Ray Charles, Willie Dixon and Koko Taylor. An announcement on the group's website in November, 2009, stated Saffire had retired and amicably disbanded. Rabson died on January 30, 2013, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, after a long battle with cancer. She was 67. Andra Faye is now living and playing in the Indianapolis, Indiana area.

Causes Acute uric acid nephropathy is usually seen as part of the acute tumour lysis syndrome in patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of malignancies with rapid cell turnover, such as leukemia and lymphoma. It may also occur in these patients before treatment is begun, due to spontaneous tumor cell lysis (high incidence in Burkitt's lymphoma). Acute uric acid nephropathy can also be caused by an acute attack of gout. Pathophysiology Acute uric acid nephropathy is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals within the kidney interstitium and tubules, leading to partial or complete obstruction of collecting ducts, renal pelvis, or ureter. This obstruction is usually bilateral, and patients follow the clinical course of acute kidney failure. Diagnosis The picture of acute kidney failure is observed: decreased urine production and rapidly rising serum creatinine levels. Acute uric acid nephropathy is differentiated from other forms of acute kidney failure by the finding of a urine uric acid/creatinine ratio > 1 in a random urine sample. Prevention Patients at risk for acute uric acid nephropathy can be given allopurinol or rasburicase (a recombinant urate oxidase) prior to treatment with cytotoxic drugs. Treatment Treatment is focused on preventing deposition of uric acid within the urinary system by increasing urine volume with potent diuretics such as furosemide. Raising the urinary pH to a level higher than 7 (alkalinization) is often difficult to attain, although sodium bicarbonate and/or acetazolamide are sometimes used in an attempt to increase uric acid solubility. Dialysis (preferably hemodialysis) is started if the above measures fail.

It is widely installed in many online games to block possibly malicious applications and prevent common methods of cheating. nProtect GameGuard provides B2B2C (Business to Business to Consumer) security services for online game companies and portal sites. The software is considered to be one of three software programs which \\"dominate the online game security market\\". GameGuard uses rootkits to proactively prevent cheat software from running. GameGuard hides the game application process, monitors the entire memory range, terminates applications defined by the game vendor and INCA Internet to be cheats (QIP for example), blocks certain calls to Direct X functions and Windows APIs, keylogs keyboard input, and auto-updates itself to change as new possible threats surface. Since GameGuard essentially works like a rootkit, players may experience unintended and potentially unwanted side effects. If set, GameGuard blocks any installation or activation of hardware and peripherals (e.g., a mouse) while the program is running. Since GameGuard monitors any changes in the computer's memory, it will cause performance issues when the protected game loads multiple or large resources all at once. Additionally, some versions of GameGuard have an unpatched privilege escalation bug, allowing any program to issue commands as if they were running under an Administrator account. GameGuard possesses a database on game hacks based on security references from more than 260 game clients.

It was also produced in the MOBAT version without a gun shield, and the ConBAT version with a new spotting rifle attachment. The L6 Wombat version was greatly lightened through the use of magnesium alloys. The Wombat was used by mobile units such as paratroopers and marines.Weaponsystems.net BAT was developed from the wartime Ordnance, RCL, 3.45 in, replacing it and the Ordnance QF 17-pounder to become the standard anti-tank weapon of the Army in the post-World War II era. The BAT and MOBAT were used until anti-tank guided missiles, such as Vigilant and MILAN, took their place. WOMBAT remained in anti-tank platoons in Berlin to supplement MILAN until the late 1980s, due to the expected engagement ranges should the Warsaw Pact have ever attacked. The wire guidance of MILAN would also have been problematic in the built up areas of Berlin. It was envisioned that Wombat would be used in 'shoot-and-scoot' attacks mounted on the back of stripped down Land Rover vehicles. The Wombat was a development version which replaced the earlier BAT and MOBAT weapons. It was in turn replaced by anti- tank guided missiles. The L6 Wombat itself comprised the L12A3 BAT gun, but mounted on a new lightweight carriage. The vertically sliding breech of the BAT and MoBAT was replaced by a lighter horizontally hinged breech. The Wombat was mounted on a small two wheeled carriage, which was removable in order to be moved over obstacles and then locked to the carriage again. The weapon was normally carried in the rear of a specially adapted Land Rover (Portee). The Wombat could also be mounted on the FV432/40 armoured personnel carrier. The usual round for Wombat was a HESH, which it could fire out to around 1,800 m. The HESH round could defeat of armour.Norris, p. 108. Other ammunition types include the canister and modified canister rounds. The latter released flechettes, or small darts, giving a \\"shotgun\\" effect. These rounds could be used against infantry in the open. The base of the BAT cartridge case was frangible, the reaction gases venting directly backwards through a single large venturi.

Three of his documentaries won Emmy Awards. Early life and career Levin was born in Brooklyn, New York with his original name being Alan Levinstein. He served during World War II and graduated from Wesleyan University in Connecticut in 1946. His career started as a journalist working for Associated Press and the New York Post. He worked for Senator Harrison Williams in 1963-64 before becoming a producer on WABC-TV between 1965-67. His father, Herman, assisted Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan with his founding of the Jewish Reconstructionist movement in the 1930s. His grandfather, Isaac Levinstein, owned several movie theaters in New York in the early 1900s. Documentary career Levin's documentary career started with WNET, a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) primary member station. He first attracted attention with The New Immigrants in 1979 which explored the immigration of non-European migrants to the US which earned him his first Emmy. His 1982 film Portrait of an American Zealot was one of the first films of the growing popularity of the so-called religious right. That film marked the end of his employment for PBS although he would continue to make films for the network. In 1986, he made Inside the Jury Room featuring the first jury deliberation to be filmed which was shown on PBS Frontline He partnered with Bill Moyers to film a number of documentaries. The Secret Government: The Constitution in Crisis looked at the activities of the CIA leading up to the Iran-Contra Affair. It earned Levin his second Emmy.

In the words of J. R. McCulloch,Wages in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (4th edn 1823) The economists who first stated this relationship assumed that the amount of capital available in a given year to pay wages was an unchanging amount. So they thought that as the population changed so too would the wages of workers. If the population increased, but the amount of money available to pay as wages stayed the same, the results might be all workers would make less, or if one worker made more, another would have to make less to make up for it and workers would struggle to earn enough money to provide for basic living requirements. Later economists determined that the relationship of capital and wages was more complex than originally thought. This is because capital in a given year is not necessarily a fixed amount, and the wage‚Äìfund doctrine was eventually abandoned in favor of later models. Model : Wage=\\\\frac{Capital}{Population} In essence, wage‚Äìfund doctrine states that workers‚Äô wages are determined by a ratio of capital to the population of available workers. In this model, there is a fixed amount of capital available to pay for the costs of production and the wages necessary to sustain workers in the time between the start of production and the sale of production output. Capital may change from year to year, but only as a result of reinvesting the prior year‚Äôs savings. ‚ÄúThe wage-fund, therefore, may be greater or less at another time, but at the time taken it is definite.‚Äù (Walker) Population is the endogenous variable affecting wages. As the working population changes, the available wage moves in the opposite direction. Additionally, because capital is fixed, ‚Äúthe whole of [wage fund] is distributed without loss; and the average amount received by each laborer is, therefore, precisely determined by the ratio existing between the wage-fund and the number of laborers.‚Äù (Walker) If one worker earns more, another worker must earn less to compensate. Origins The doctrine has its roots in the Physiocrats‚Äô Tableau √©conomique (Spiegel, pg. 389) in which the landowners provide capital to farmers in the form of land leases. The amount of land and the rents from it are fixed, and the capital needed for farming supplies and food for laborers in any one year is directly derived from the profits of the previous year‚Äôs production. Population is also the variable factor, but for the Physiocrats, it was constrained by the amount of land available for growing food, not by the amount of capital available to pay wages. From the early 1800s until after the Napoleonic wars were over in 1815, Great Britain had almost full employment to the point that ‚Äúan increase in the number of laborers had the effect to throw some out of employment or to reduce the rate of wages for all.‚Äù (Walker) Capital was still believed to come only from savings in prior years, and no additional amount of money could be added to the production process to support more workers. Additionally, the capital used in the equation above was the macroeconomic concept of a country‚Äôs total accumulated wealth, not the wealth of individuals. At the macroeconomic level, though, enough capital had been generated in prior years that ‚Äúemployers found no (financial) difficulty in paying their laborers by the month, the week, or the day, instead of requiring them to await the fruition of their labor in the harvested or marketed product.‚Äù (Walker) Unlike the Physiocrats‚Äô tableau, the money to maintain the subsistence of employees during production did not have to come from previous year‚Äôs savings. The wages were so low, however, that workers still lived at barely subsistence level. Principles of Political Economy John Stuart Mill‚Äôs Principles of Political Economy, published in 1848, provides the definitive treatment of Wage-Fund Doctrine. Mill‚Äôs solution to increasing the wage rate above subsistence level is to control the growth of the population. If population grew faster than the growth of capital, wages would fall. If wages fell below subsistence levels, population would decrease from disease and starvation. In 1869, Mill qualifies his support of the Wage- Fund Doctrine due to recognition that capital is not necessarily fixed in that it can be supplemented through ‚Äúincome of the employer which might otherwise go into savings or be spent on consumption.‚Äù (Spiegel, pg. 390) Walker also states in ‚ÄúThe Wages Question‚Äù that the limits on capital and the growth in population ‚Äúwere accidental, not essential‚Äù to the formation of the doctrine. The limitation on the growth of industrial capacity placed a limit on the number of workers who could be accommodated more than the limit on capital. Furthermore, English agriculture ‚Äúhad reached the condition of diminishing returns.\\" (Walker); therefore, each additional worker was not providing more output than he needed for himself for survival. Given the improvements in technology and productivity that followed 1848, the original reasons that gave rise to the doctrine were seen to be unusual and not the basis for a universal law.  Criticism  In a preface to the first edition of his 1871 publication The Theory of Political Economy, a seminal work in the Marginal Revolution in economic theory, William Stanley Jevons criticises Wage-Fund Doctrine as useless, calling it \\"purely delusional\\" and stating: > \\"This theory pretends to give a solution of the main problem of the science > [economics]‚Äîto determine the wages of labour; yet, on close examination, its > conclusion is found to be a mere truism, namely, that the average rate of > wages is found by dividing the whole amount appropriated to the payment of > wages by the number of those between whom it is divided.\\" See also *Labour economics NotesReferences *Walker, Francis Amasa; *The Wages Question] Macmillan and Co. 1888. *Spiegel, Henry William; The Growth of Economic Thought, Duke University Press, 1983.

It is opposed to the assertion that consciousness results exclusively from properties of specific types of matter, e.g. brain tissue. Etymology and specific definition The term is relatively uncommon even in philosophical discussion, and is often erroneously equated with panpsychism despite notable differences between the two views that are evident in the etymologies of the two words: \\"panpsychism\\" derives from the Greek pan, \\"all\\", and psyche, \\"soul\\" or \\"mind\\" (the terms consciousness and experience being preferred in philosophy), and implies the sentience of all things; hylopathism derives from hylo-, which is translated either as \\"matter\\" or \\"wood\\" depending on its context, and whose English equivalent is hyle, and pathos, \\"emotion\\" or \\"suffering\\" (and, by extension, experience).

The historic home to the Kalmuck or Kalmyks it is in the Federal subject of Astrakhan Oblast in Russia. Before the appearance of the Kalmyks to this region, the area was long known as the Povoletsk steppe by the Russians. The western Kalmuck Steppe occupied by the Ergeni hills, is deeply trenched by ravines and rises 300 and occasionally 630 ft. above the sea. It is built up of Tertiary deposits, belonging to the Sarmatian division of the Miocene period and covered with bess and black earth, and its escarpments represent the old shore-line of the Caspian. No Caspian deposits are found on or within the Ergeni hills. These hills exhibit the usual black earth flora, and they have a settled population. The eastern part of the steppe is a plain, lying for the most part 30 to 40 ft. below the level of the sea and sloping gently towards the Volga. Post-Pliocene Aral-Caspian deposits, containing the usual fossils (Hydrobia, Neritina, eight species of Cardium, two of Dreissena, three of Adacna and Lithoglyphus caspius), attain thicknesses varying from 105 ft. to 7 or 10 feet, and disappear in places. Lacustrine and fluviatile mineral deposits occur intermingled with the above. Large areas of moving sands exist near Enotayevsk, where high dunes or barkhans have been formed. A narrow tract of land along the coast of the Caspian, known as the ‚Äúhillocks of Baer,‚Äù is covered with hillocks elongated from west to east, perpendicularly to the coast-line, the spaces between them being filled with water or overgrown with thickets of reed, Salix, Ulmus campestris, almond trees, &c.; An archipelago of little islands is thus formed close to the shore by these mounds, which are backed on the N. and N.W. by strings of salt lakes, partly desiccated. Small streams originate in the Ergenis, but are lost as soon as they reach the lowlands, where water can only be obtained from wells. The scanty vegetation is a mixture of the flora of south-east Russia and that of the deserts of central Asia. As of 1911, the steppe had an estimated population of 130,000 persons, living in over 27,700 kibitkas, or felt tents. There were many Buddhist monasteries. Part of the Kalmucks were settled (chiefly in the hilly parts), the remainder being nomads. Antony Beevor, in his 1998 book Stalingrad, said that \\"Russians from the north thought of [Kalmyk Steppe] as 'the end of the world'\\". In 1943 the people were forcibly deported (see Kalmykia).

She is best known for her video, sound, performance and installation works. An amalgamation of dream, fiction, memory and re-enactment, Starr's work has been described in Artforum magazine as exploring \\"the imaginative self‚Äôs ability to make something magically complex, layered and densely referential out of virtually nothing but its own 'stuff'‚Äù Life and work Starr was born in Leeds and lives and works in London. She studied at Jacob Kramer school of Art, Middlesex Polytechnic, attended the Slade School of Art from 1990 until 1992 and the Rijksakademie Van Beeldende Kunst in Amsterdam from 1993 to 1994. She has exhibited widely in group and solo exhibitions, including the Tate Gallery in London, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Venice Biennale, and in galleries in cities throughout the world including Basel, Tokyo, Ghent, Brisbane, and Barcelona. She has been identified as a member of the second wave of Young British Artists. Whether playing a lonely teenager re-enacting a high school play (Frenchy, 1996), a nightclub singer with schizophrenia (The Hungry Brain, 1995), a visitor from another planet (Visit to a Small Planet, 1994), a silent movie star (THEDA, 2007-10), a ventriloquist or psychic medium, her face and voice are always the focus, constantly changing and morphing as she performs. As David Frankel noted in Artforum, ‚Äùshe seems both a familiar presence and at the same time unknowable, one multifaceted figure- she is all of them-but at the same time non-of them at all‚Ä¶ Starr proposes a model of art-making and combines the baroque with the spontaneous‚Ä¶.the frame is fiction\\". Starr's first video Static Steps in 1992 featured small paper figures reacting physically to \\"random static electricity\\" and added a voice-over narrating the 'steps' as if the movements were rehearsed dance steps. The idea was to re-describe invisible and \\"often random aspects of modern life\\" so they seem important. In 1993, Starr's video Crying was described as \\"euphoric\\".\\" A review from 1996 said of Crying, ‚Äú If expressionist art demands the simultaneous release and recording of deep feeling, then this might be expressionism's quintessence - but as the tape plays again, and again, emotion becomes performance. What may have been a problem for Jackson Pollock here appears as strategy: repeated, the gesture that carries emotion loses meaning. Yet enough of a trace of it remains that one would be ashamed to write it off as rote or fake; better to say that it becomes elusive and unreliable. And Starr, who seems to show us herself so openly, eludes us too.\\" In 1994, Starr's Visit to a Small Planet featured videos, photographs, objects and drawings based loosely on a memory of a Jerry Lewis film called Visit to a Small Planet which evoked many emotional states. In the five screen videos Starr was given special powers of mind-reading, invisibility and animal telepathy. The large installation was exhibited as a solo exhibition at Kunsthalle Zurich in 1995 alongside the publication of her first book, \\"Visit to a Small Planet\\", a script which spanned the years 1978 (when she saw the original film aged 10) to the present day. The work then toured in the British Art Show4. In 1996, Starr made Hypnodreamdruff which began as a film script, but turned into a \\"multi-screen, multi-media installation incorporating a nightclub, bedroom, kitchen and caravan,\\" according to a description on her website. It was exhibited in Amsterdam at Stedelijk Museum in 1995, Tate London in 1996, in New York City at Barbara Gladstone in 1996, and Kunstmuseum Wolfsburg, Germany in 1997. Hypnodreamdruff was a complex narrative of the \\"interior life\\" of one of three fictional people sharing an apartment and was described as a \\"rowdy yet poignant portrait of the alienation and fantasy of everyday life.\\" David Frankel described the work in Artforum as \\"involving a series of interlocking situations or narratives carried by videos and installations, their sites ranging from a 1970‚Äôs caravan seen in Magic to a teenage girl's bedroom (in Frenchy) to a nightclub (The Hungry Brain) to the kitchen of three London flatmates (Dream Interference Device). An amalgam of dream, memory, reenactment, and something like TV sitcom‚Ä¶‚Äù Critic Dan Glaister of The Guardian reported that Catherine Lampert of the Whitechapel Gallery was surprised that no women were nominated for the 1996 Turner prize; Lampert said \\"Tracey Emin and Georgina Starr have both produced notable work this year (1996).\\" In 1998, critic Tim Hilton of The Independent described Starr's Tuberama as an \\"expensively constructed\\" model tube train which went around the gallery while an animated film by Starr played simultaneously with \\"loud music.\\" Critic and pop singer Momus described Tuberama as \\"the musical of the short story of the cartoon strip of the painting, is about sitting on the tube and feeling paranoid about the people opposite you: who would be their leader if the train broke down for a week?\\" In his essay, Tuberama, A Musical on the Northern Line Filip Luyckx describes Tuberama : \\"While we identify ourselves with Georgina, she translates, as if she were a thought-reading machine, what goes on in the minds of the passengers‚Ä¶..The eroticising aspect of the imagination in contemporary mass culture finds a grateful subject here. A work like Tuberama starts as a comic strip and gradually overruns into our reality.\\" In a review in Art Monthly in 2000 a critic described Starr's new exhibition in London The Bunny Lakes are Coming: \\"Art is meant to be more sensitive than popular culture but doesn't always manage it. The Bunny Lakes are Coming is a melange of pop cultural melancholy and terror that is as sensitive as a fresh bruise. Starr's longstanding interest in the exploration of internality through the products of popular culture has been chided in the past. If returning home is a way of testing whether you have moved one, Starr has not endeavoured to please. Her new work is as dark as her early work was light. Maybe her early work was too soft, now it's too soft to touch.\\" In 2007, film critic Jonathan Romney described Starr's new silent film Theda : \\"In a 40-minute black-and-white film Theda British artist Georgina Starr, best known for her series of works inspired by the 1965 thriller Bunny Lake is Missing, pays tribute to this stormiest of divas and undertakes an archeology of gestural art of the silent-era actress (Theda Bara), drawing on the styles of several other now forgotten grande-dames, such as Barbara La Marr and Maud Allan.....the film is divided into three parts \\"prelude\\", \\"act\\" and \\"epilogue\\"....but \\"prelude \\" is the real coup: in a long single take, Starr runs through the codified expressive repertoire of the Theda-era performer with such precision that any ironic distance evaporate. The poster for \\"Theda\\" show a s√©ance and indeed Starr makes herself the medium. Through her playful, tender homage the silent goddesses speak again.\\" Art critic John Zinsser described his reaction to Starr's show Theda in New York City: \\"It was a show that revealed itself to me very slowly\\" which was \\"full of surprises\\" and that the personality of the show was \\"very strong\\" and \\"beguiling in its nuttiness.\\" Zinsser described Starr as a \\"video artist\\" whose work featured a book about a \\"movie that you didn't see\\" which was \\"written in a faux academic style\\". Critic Gregory Volk compared Starr to writers like Emerson in making a \\"meter making argument\\" and that her show was \\"so out there\\" and \\"crazily eccentric\\" and \\"crazily adventurous\\" and, as a result, \\"utterly convincing.\\" Theda toured as a film with live soundtrack to New York City, Toronto, Tokyo, Liverpool, Basel, Berlin, Genoa and Stockholm. In 2011 a new score was composed by the German soprano Sigune von Osten for a live performance at The Pier Theatre in Bournemouth. Starr was a judge for the Northern Art Prize in 2008. The Guardian reported in November 2008 that Starr was dating artist Paul Noble who paints \\"debauched imaginary townscapes.\\" Starr and Noble traveled to Palestine and both worked at the International Academy of Art Palestine. Artist Andrew Palmer credits Starr for influencing his thinking about art. In November 2008, Starr put artwork from her project Bunny Lake and reproduced them on a Vespa scooter in a project to raise funds for charity. Starr's 2010 project I am a Record, according to a website description, dissected and revealed \\"the artist's personal, geographic and imagined environment\\" and featured a wide variety of recordings made since age five including the rumbling of a broken radiator which she thought was \\"speaking to her,\\" \\"re- enactments of secretly recorded stranger's conversation,\\" field recordings, singing voices, paranormal telephony, family dinner conversations, \\"air eddies transformed into music,\\" and other unusual sounds. It is an audio collection featuring over 80 vinyl records with handmade cover artwork, posters, inserts and booklets. The monograph I am a Record was published in 2010 by Le Confort Moderne. A large retrospective exhibition of Starr's work entitled \\"Hello. Come here. I want you.\\" was held in France at Frac Franche Comt√© in 2017 presenting earlier works alongside newly commissioned installations.

Text The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 31 verses. Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text, which includes the Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BCE.

Using the appeal to his filial respect to a mother and his birth as an answer of a prayer (verse 2, cf. ), the mother warns the king against sexual promiscuity and drunkenness (verses 3‚Äì7). The 8th and 9th verses KJV. are an appeal against inequality and injustice: The good wife (31:10‚Äì31) Verses 10‚Äì31 of the chapter are called Eshet ·∏§ayil (◊ê◊©◊™ ◊ó◊ô◊ú, woman of valor). It is a praise of the good wife, a definition of a perfect wife or \\"ideal woman\\" in the nation of Israel, who is 'an industrious housewife, a shrewd businesswoman, an enterprising trader, a generous benefactor (verse 20) and a wise teacher (verse 26). This \\"Woman of Valor\\" has been described as the personification of wisdom, or in some sense as a description of a particular class of Women in Israel, Persia, or in Hellenistic society.Sandoval, Timothy J.

It is one of the thirteen alphabetical acrostic poems in the Bible, where each line begins with a successive letter in the Hebrew alphabet. The word ◊ó◊ô◊ú (·∏§ayil) appears in verses 10 and 29 of the passage, thought as the summary of the good woman's character. Traditionally it has been translated \\"virtuous\\" or \\"noble\\". Some scholars have suggested that it rather means \\"forceful\\", \\"mighty\\", or \\"valiant\\", because this word is almost exclusively used in the Tanakh with reference to warfare.God's Word to Women Lesson 78, Katherine Bushnell Uses This chapter is recited on Friday night before Shabbat dinner in some Jewish homes. Some see this as a praise directed from the husband to his wife. The chapter has been emphasized within the biblical womanhood movement, and a number of books have been published on the \\"Proverbs 31 woman\\". This emphasis has been subject to criticism in Christian articles. In Christian circles, this chapter has often been held up as the prime example of what a woman should be and in many cases it has been misinterpreted and misused.

The club was founded in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on January 15, 2001, becoming the first ever Aussie Rules club in the City of Vancouver. History Club founders James Lay and Stuart Grills had played Australian Football for the Seattle Cats throughout 2000. Large numbers of Australians visiting the city annually, as well as numbers of non-Australians that had shown an interest in the sport, prompted investigations into founding a club in Vancouver. Grills had talked to Duncan McFarlane (an ex-pat Australian) about starting a team in Vancouver and was given a great deal of encouragement and many contacts in Australia who may be able to help. In December 2000, Lay and Grills agreed that it would take considerable organisation to get a Vancouver Team started. Stuart had been advertising Australian Football by placing posters on his car, but there had been no real response. In December, Stuart received several emails from Greg Everett (Junior Development Executive-CAFA), and it was agreed that the Vancouver team would need resources such as footballs, uniforms (jumpers) and coaching materials to get the team started. Thanks to the efforts of Greg Everett and the behind the scenes promotions by CAFA via their website, the team began to gain numbers. Within the first few weeks of January 2001, Stuart had been contacted by several individuals interested in playing footy. The very first training session witnessed four players in attendance: James Lay, Stuart Grills, Peter Campion and Greg Everett. The seeds had been planted and the team was growing. The first official team game was held on March 17, 2001. The VAFC played an exhibition game of Gaelic Football against the Vancouver Irish Sporting Social Club ‚Äì men and women. It was a huge success and, even though the Irish won convincingly, it developed a great relationship with their organisation and is now scheduled as the first event of every season, becoming a Cougars tradition. The Official 2001 Team List comprised 33 players (36% Non-Aust). In addition to the 33 players, the VAFC developed an email list of more than 20 additional people who either were interested in playing in the future, curious about the team's success or had affiliations with the club through other teams. The club slowly helped the development of a second Vancouver area team, the Burnaby Eagles. In 2007 the Burnaby Eagles became their own entity and call Burnaby Lakes Rugby Club their home. The numbers attracted to the fast- paced sport helped the Vancouver Cougars split yet again in 2008. This was the birth of the West Coast Saints, coached by former Vancouver Cougars premiership coach Scott Sheen. The BCAFL now consists of six men's teams and three women's teams based spread across Vancouver, BC, Victoria, BC and Seattle, WA. In 2017 the Vancouver Cougars won the BCAFL Grand Final against the West Coast Saints. Jumpers and colours It was agreed by the founding members that the club needed to have a visual identity that was reflective of a power but most importantly made reference to the Canadian territory where the club would be based, deciding on the \\"Cougars\\". The VAFC is represented in all media relations and club materials as the \\"Cougars\\" and is supported by the image of the Cougar on its official logo. The Cougars have a sister-club relationship with Port Melbourne in the VFL, and wear similar jumpers (red and blue vertical stripes), the only addition being the Cougars' logo on the front. The complete set of jumpers were donated by Port Melbourne as well as a number of Australian footballs.

Early life  Chai Zemin was born in October 1916 in an ordinary family in Wenxi, Shanxi. After he graduated from high school, be became politically active and joined the Communist Party of China. Chai's career as a diplomat started in December 1960 when he entered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China. He was appointed China's ambassador to Hungary in 1961, to Guinea in 1964, and to Egypt in 1970. In 1975, China and Thailand established diplomatic relations, and Chai became the first China's ambassador to Thailand. During his two-and-half-year term in Thailand, he experienced two general elections, three coups d'√©tat, four different prime ministers and five different governments in the country. It had been a great challenge for him to work in such a turbulent environment, and the King of Thailand awarded him a White Elephant Medal for his diplomatic achievement. In the summer of 1978, China and the United States started negotiations on normalizing relations between the two countries, and Chai Zemin took the position of director in the People's Republic of China Liaison Office (PRCLO) in Washington, D.C. and participated in the negotiations. It was agreed at the end of 1978 that China and the United States would officially establish relations on January 1, 1979 and set up embassies and appoint ambassadors to each other's country. Chai thus became the first China's ambassador to the United States thirty years after the founding of the People's Republic of China. In the fall of 1981, the Michigan State University conferred an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws on Chai for his contributions to the China‚ÄìUS relations. In 1983, Chai Zeming left his ambassador position and assumed the title of vice director of the Chinese Foreign Affairs Society, and had since been a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference for three terms. In early 1990s, Chai resigned his position at the Chinese Foreign Affairs Society, and afterwards, he became director and consultant of a number of other societies and organizations.

He is popularly known as Sundara Chola as he was considered an epitome of male beauty.Early Chola temples:Parantaka I to Rajaraja I, A.D. 907-985Journal of Indian museums, Volumes 14-16, page 35A Topographical List of Inscriptions in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala States: Nilgiris District, Pudukkottai District, Ramanathapuram District, Salem District, page 41 He was the son of Arinjaya Chola and Kalyani, a princess from the clan of Vaidumbas, an Andhra dynasty based in Kurnool and Kadapa districts. Parantaka II ascended the Chola throne despite the fact that his cousin Uttama Chola, the son of Gandaraditya (the elder brother of Arinjaya) was alive and he had equal if not more claim to the Chola throne. When Parantaka II became king, the Chola kingdom had shrunk to the size of a small principality. The Pandyas in the south had revived their fortunes and had defeated the Chola armies and occupied their ancestral lands. During Parantaka II's reign, the foundations were laid for the success of the Chola Empire a generation later. A few territories in the north were recovered. The Pandyan ruler Vira Pandya was defeated and Madurai was taken. An expedition was made to gain control of Sri Lanka but it was not successful.  Pandyan War  Immediately after becoming the Chola king, Parantaka II's attention was directed towards the growing strength of the Pandyas in the south. Vira Pandya, having repulsed Gandaraditya's attempts to restore Chola supremacy in the Pandya country, was ruling as an independent potentate. The invading Chola army met the Pandyas at Chevur. The Leyden copperplate inscriptions tell us in that war, \\"Parantaka II caused rivers of blood to flow\\". Other inscriptions mention that Parantaka and his young son, Aditya Karikalan (also referred to as Aditya II) defeated Vira Pandya and made him flee to the hills surrounding the battlefield. The young son Aditya, who took to the battlefield at the age of \\"twelve\\" and who was a \\"very abhimanyu\\" in valour, is profusely praised for having conducted himself in battlefield with as much ease as he was at \\"military training sessions\\". It is also possible that Aditya Karikalan killed Vira Pandya in that battle. Aditya's inscriptions use the epithet \\"Vira Pandyan Thalai Konda Adithha Karikalan\\" - \\"...took the head of Vira Pandya\\". After the battle of Chevur, Parantaka II's armies continued their thrust into the Pandya country. The Pandya king had the Sinhalese king Mahinda IV as his ally and the Lankan troops supported the Pandya army in the battlefield c. 959 CE. Parantaka II's armies also invaded Lanka to neutralise this support. The especially wicked nature of this coalition is noted by chola panegyrists to be \\"wicked force of age of kali, that were duly uprooted by the king.\\". As a procedure for de-recognizing the rogue kingdoms sundara chola also seized the royal insignia of pandyans like fish emblem, throne, gem studded crown and ancient pearl necklace. Sundara Chola called himself Maduraikonda Rajakesari, that is the Royal Lion who took Madurai and Madhurantaka (destroyer of Madurai) in order to commemorate his victories over the Pandyas. Although the Chola armies won the battle, the war was still not won. Parantaka II did not succeed in re-establishing the Chola power over the Pandya lands.  Success against Rashtrakutas  Parantaka II next concentrated in his war against Rashtrakutas. With his son and heir-apparent Aditya II at the command, the Chola armies succeeded in brutally avenging a previous treason by the great deccan dynasty and thereby completing the rout of foes started by Parantaka I. Some documents provide an interesting account of military acumen and gallantry exhibited during the war by a certain chola commander belonging to one of the 98 divisions of troop velaikkaras. The commander who is praised to be a devotee at feet of lord at thillai and who was \\"a very murugan at war\\", is credited to have on two occasions almost singlehandedly pulverized big battalions of the enemy thereby causing their defeat. This commander who is glorified in these deccan wars is at the instance of lord finally given up his uniform to become a saint at tirruvottriyur and take the name ottriyur atikalar there upon producing some very good works on saiva siddantam prior to attaining lord's beatitude. Sri Lankan Expedition Sundara Chola Parantaka also waged war against the Sinhala ruler in Sri Lanka. The expedition was led by his general and his relative the Irukkuvel chief Parantaka Siriyavelar. However this expedition did not end well for the Cholas as both Siriyavelar and the Chola King's brother in law, the Bana chief fell in battle.  Aditya II‚Äôs (Aditya Karikalan) Assassination  Parantaka II's last days appear to have been clouded by a personal tragedy. The heir-apparent Aditya II was assassinated by a group of conspirators. There are other theories, claiming that the Pandyan spies were involved in the death of Aditya II and he was assassinated to avenge the death of Veerapandiyan in the battle of Chevur. There are however no direct evidence to support this theory. One of the inscriptions found at Udayarkudi temple in Tamil Nadu of Rajaraja notes that the property of some persons were confiscated as punishment for their involvement in the plot.  Uttama‚Äôs ascension  After the assassination of Aditya II, it seems that Uttama forced Parantaka II to make him the heir- apparent. Arulmozhivarman (or Rajaraja I), Parantaka II's second son did not protest, anxious to avoid a civil war. It was apparently part of the compromise that Uttama was to succeed the throne only if he accepted to be succeeded, not by his own children but by Arulmolivarman. The Thiruvalangadu copperplate inscription states that Madhurantaka Uttama Chola made Arulmoli the heir-apparent.  Parantaka II's death and Legacy  Parantaka II, heart broken by the personal tragedy died in Kanchipuram at his golden palace (c. 973 CE). He was thereafter known as \\"Pon maligai thunjina thevar\\" ‚Äì \\"the king who died in the golden palace\\". Parantaka continued the chola legacy of absolutely professional and democratic management. This is seen from many inscriptions of his and his illustrious son aditya karikalan II, which describe reforms carried out professionally at universities, councils, military and navy. Parantaka was well supported by his management councillors. Thus we know from an inscription of his how a certain aniruddha brahmarayan who was a follower of jaiminiya sutra of samaveda(jaiminiya sutrattu aniruddha bhramarayar) and who was a \\"servitor at the feet of lord of river girt arankam(srirangam),i.e lord vishnu\\", who belonged to royal council being felicitated for selfless service. One of his queens, Vanavanmahadevi, a princess from the clan of Malaiyaman, committed sati at the king's death and her image was perhaps installed at the Thanjavur Temple by her daughter Kundavai. Another queen, a Chera princess survived him until 1001 CE. During Parantaka II's reign, literature both Sanskrit and Tamil received encouragement. The Buddhist work on Tamil grammar, Virasoliyam eulogises hims as a parton of letters and of Buddhism. The eulogy furnishes evidence for the friendly relationship between the Chola monarchs and the Buddhists.  Inscriptions  The following is an inscription of Sundara Chola from the Sivayoganathaswami Temple in Tiruvisalur, The term foremost in the family of the king Pirantaka's daughter indicates the alliance between the Chola and Irukkuvel families and the chief Siriyavela might have been the King's son-in- law or his daughter's father-in-law. Here is another inscription of Sundara Chola from the Vedapurisvara temple in Tirukkalittattai (north wall of the central shrine),  References in Popular Tamil Fiction  Sundara Chola, forms a main character in Kalki Krishnamurthy‚Äôs historical Romance Ponniyin Selvan. In his story, Kalki imagines Sundara Chola to be an impotent ruler - handicapped by a debilitating illness. He is caught between opposing forces of his love for his children and his dependence on powerful courtiers. Notes References  * Nilakanta Sastri, K. A. (1935).

It was first described by Giuseppe Gradenigo in 1904. Symptoms Components of the syndrome include: *retroorbital pain due to pain in the area supplied by the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve), *abducens nerve palsy (sixth cranial nerve) *otitis media Other symptoms can include photophobia, excessive lacrimation, fever, and reduced corneal sensitivity. The syndrome is classically caused by the spread of an infection into the petrous apex of the temporal bone. Diagnosis The constellation of symptoms was first described as a consequence of severe, advanced ear infection which has spread to a central portion of the temporal bone of the skull. This type of presentation was common prior to development of antibiotic treatments, and is now a rare complication. In persons with longstanding ear infection and typical symptoms, medical imaging such as CT or MRI of the head may show changes that confirm disease involvement of the petrous apex of temporal bone. Treatment The medical treatment is done with antibiotics: ceftriaxone plus metronidazole (which covers anaerobic bacteria). In more severe cases, a paracentesis (aspiration of fluids) or mastoidectomy may be needed. Eponym It is named after Count Giuseppe Gradenigo, an Italian Otolaryngologist, and Maurice Lannois.

He was a known radical who advocated constitutional monarchy and supported Wu Luzhen's mutiny during the Xinhai Revolution. He became the Progressive Party boss of Tianjin. In 1912, he secured the loyalty of the Inner Mongolian tribes to Yuan Shikai. He broke with Yuan during the National Protection War and was one of the first to fight against Zhang Xun's attempt to restore the Qing dynasty in 1917. He became affiliated with Cao Kun's Zhili clique and ruled Rehe. He and Wu Peifu advocated the return of the original National Assembly. He served as Li Yuanhong's premier in 1923. He opposed Cao and Wu's plan to invade Guangdong to defeat Sun Yatsen's rival government, preferring to negotiate unification. His tenure as premier in the Beiyang government was marked by greed and self-glorification and he was forced to flee to the British legation in Tianjin after his resignation. In 1928, he was assassinated by Zhang Zuolin after he was found to have contacts with the Guominjun and Kuomintang.

It is never universal, especially in careful speech, and it most often alternates with other allophones of such as , , (before a nasal), (before a lateral), or . As a sound change, it is a subtype of debuccalization. The pronunciation that it results in is called glottalization. Apparently, glottal reinforcement, which is quite common in English, is a stage preceding full replacement of the stop, and indeed, reinforcement and replacement can be in free variation. History The earliest mentions of the process are in Scotland during the 19th century, when Henry Sweet commented on the phenomenon. Peter Trudgill has argued that it began in Norfolk, based on studies of rural dialects of those born in the 1870s. The SED fieldworker Peter Wright found it in areas of Lancashire and said, \\"It is considered a lazy habit, but may have been in some dialects for hundreds of years.\\" Most early English dialectology focussed on rural areas, so it is hard to establish how long the process has existed in urban areas. It has long been seen as a feature of Cockney dialect,Wells, John C. (1982). Accents of English. Volume 2: The British Isles (pp. 323-327). Cambridge University Press. 0-52128540-2. and a 1955 study on Leeds dialect wrote that it occurred with \\"monotonous regularity\\" before consonants and often between vowel sounds.Courtney, Maureen R (1955), The Living Dialect of Leeds in the West Riding of Yorkshire, page 7. Available in the Leeds Archive of Vernacular Culture. David Crystal claims that the sound can be heard in Received Pronunciation (RP) speakers from the early 20th century such as Daniel Jones, Bertrand Russell and Ellen Terry. The Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary claims that t-glottalization is now most common in London, Leeds, Edinburgh, and Glasgow. Uniquely for English in the West Indies, Barbadian English uses a glottal allophone for /t/, and also less frequently for /k/ and /p/.Wells, John C. (1982), Accents of English 3: Beyond the British Isles, page 584, Cambridge, New York: Cambridge University Press, Glottal reinforcement (pre-glottalization) Pre-glottalization of is found in RP and General American (GA) when the consonant occurs before another consonant, or before a pause: *pre-consonantal: get some lightning at last *final (pre-pausal): wait bat about The glottal closure overlaps with the consonant that it precedes, but the articulatory movements involved can usually be observed only by using laboratory instruments.Roach, P.J. (1979) \`Laryngeal-oral coarticulation in glottalised English plosives', Journal of the International Phonetic Association , 9, pp. 1-6) In words such as 'eaten' and 'button', pronounced with a glottal closure, it is generally almost impossible to know whether the has been pronounced (e.g. , ) or omitted (e.g. , ). However, in the same syllable coda position, /t/ may instead be analyzed as an unreleased stop.Odden, David (2005). Introduction to Phonology. Page 32. In some accents of English, may be pre-glottalized intervocalically if it occurs finally in a stressed syllable. In the north-east of England and East Anglia, pronunciations such as 'paper' , 'happy' are found. There is variation in the occurrence of glottalization within RP according to which consonant follows : for example, some speakers do not glottalize when follows, in words such as 'petrol' /Ààp…õtr…ôl/, 'mattress' /Ààm√¶tr…ôs/.Roach, P.J. \`Glottalization of English /p,t,k,t É/ - a re-examination', Journal of the International Phonetic Association,3, 10-21. (1973) T-glottalization rarely occurs syllable-initially in English but has been reported in some words that begin in some northern dialects.KM Petyt, Dialect' and Accent in Industrial West Yorkshire, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 1985, p. 219Docherty, Foulkes, Milroy, Milroy and Walshaw (1997) Descriptive adequacy in phonology in Journal of Linguistics 33, p. 290 Glottal replacement In RP, and in many accents such as Cockney as well as all American English, it is common for to be completely replaced by a glottal stop before another consonant, as in not now and department . This replacement also happens before a syllabic , as in button (representable as ). Among speakers of Britain, especially younger ones, glottal replacement of is frequently heard in intervocalic position before an unstressed vowel. It is most common between a stressed vowel and a reduced vowel (): * getting better (in GA, this is ); * societies , detail (these are slightly less likely to be glottalized). In both RP and GA, -replacement is found in absolute final position, though most commonly in younger people's speech. * pick it up (though, in GA, this is more commonly ) * let's start * what or * foot T-glottalization is believed to have been spreading in Southern England at a faster rate than th-fronting. Cruttenden comments that \\"Use of for word- medially intervocalically, as in water, still remains stigmatised in GB.\\" (GB is his alternative term for RP). The increased use of glottal stops within RP is believed to be an influence from Cockney and other working-class urban speech. In a 1985 publication on the speech of West Yorkshire, KM Petyt found that t-glottalization was spreading from Bradford (where it had been reported in traditional dialect) to Halifax and Huddersfield (where it had not been reported in traditional dialect). In 1999, Shorrocks noted the phenomenon amongst young people in Bolton, Greater Manchester: \\"It is not at all typical of the traditional vernacular, in contradistinction to some other varieties of English, but younger people use medially between vowels more than their elders.\\" Recent studies (Milroy, Milroy & Walshaw 1994, Fabricius 2000) have suggested that t-glottalization is increasing in RP speech. Prince Harry frequently glottalizes his t's. Also see The Cambridge Encyclopedia of the English Language, p. 365 One study carried out by Anne Fabricius suggests that t-glottalization is increasing in RP, the reason for this being the dialect levelling of the Southeast. She has argued that a wave-like profile of t-glottalization has been going on through the regions, which has begun with speakers in London, due to the influence of Cockney. She says that this development is due to the population size of the capital, as well as London's dominance of the Southeast of England. However, Miroslav Je≈æek has argued that linguists attribute changes to London too readily, and that the evidence suggests that t-glottalization began in Scotland and worked its way down gradually to London.

The first two years of the Scottish Master of Arts consist of ordinary Bachelor level courses; however, after these, students who are accepted to pursue the Honours route will complete more advanced subjects and write a dissertation in their fourth year. Students who choose to do a \\"general\\" degree will complete their third year at a lower level of specialisation, and receive a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or MA without Honours. For the postgraduate degree referred to in other places as \\"Master of Arts\\", Scottish universities usually award the degree of Master of Letters (MLitt) or Master of Science (MSc). Generally, non-ancient universities in Scotland (e.g. University of Strathclyde, The Robert Gordon University, Edinburgh Napier University, etc.), award arts degrees as Bachelor of Arts. Subjects awarded At these ancient Scottish universities, the degree of Master of Arts (MA) is usually awarded only in the liberal arts, the humanities, the fine arts, the social sciences and theology. For some science subjects, the degree of Bachelor of Science (BSc) is awarded for four years of study and that of Bachelor of Laws (LLB) after a four-year course in law. Both of these can be awarded with honours after four years or as ordinary or designated degrees after three years. An LLB can also be awarded in two years on an accelerated programme if the student has already obtained a first degree. Degrees in some disciplines, such as psychology, can lead either to the degree of MA or that of BSc. For example, those studying psychology or management at the University of St Andrews or the University of Dundee may graduate MA or BSc, depending on whether they are a member of the Faculty of Arts or the Faculty of Sciences respectively. At the University of Aberdeen, students studying psychology are awarded an MA or a BSc, depending on which of the two they register for; while the psychology content is identical for both, the difference lies in the non- psychology constituent courses taken in the first and second years. Those on MA programmes study psychology alongside the lit arts (such as languages) or social sciences, while those on BSc programmes study pure sciences such as biology. The Universities of Glasgow, Aberdeen, and Edinburgh also offer the degree of Bachelor of Divinity (BD) as a four-year course. This degree is offered at St Mary's College, St Andrews, but as a postgraduate degree for a graduate who is already a Master of Arts, while the undergraduate degree in divinity (theology) is designated Master of Theology (MTheol). Newer undergraduate courses lead either to a bachelor's degree or to a master's degree in the advanced undergraduate degree scheme as above.

While consequentialist and deontological ethical theories emphasize generalizable standards and impartiality, ethics of care emphasize the importance of response to the individual. The distinction between the general and the individual is reflected in their different moral questions: \\"what is just?\\" versus \\"how to respond?\\".Gilligan, Carol. \\"Moral Orientation and Moral Development.\\" The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By Alison Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 469 Print. Carol Gilligan, who is considered the originator of the ethics of care, criticized the application of generalized standards as \\"morally problematic, since it breeds moral blindness or indifference\\".Gilligan, Carol. \\"Moral Orientation and Moral Development.\\" In Alison Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo (eds.). The Feminist Philosophy Reader. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 471 Print. Some assumptions of the theory are basic: # Persons are understood to have varying degrees of dependence and interdependence on one another. # Other individuals affected by the consequences of one's choices deserve consideration in proportion to their vulnerability. # Situational details determine how to safeguard and promote the interests of those involved. Historical background=Carol Gilligan and In a Different Voice The originator of the ethics of care (EoC) was Carol Gilligan, an American ethicist and psychologist. Gilligan was a student of developmental psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg. Gilligan developed EoC in contrast to her mentor's theory of stages of moral development. She held that measuring progress by Kohlberg's model resulted in boys being found to be more morally mature than girls, and this held for adult men and women as well (although when education is controlled for there are no gender differences).Walker, L.J. (1991). \\"Sex differences in moral reasoning.\\" In W.M. Kurtines and J. L. Gewirtz (eds.) Handbook of moral behavior and development: Vol, 2. Research. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum. Gilligan further argued that Kohlberg's model was not an objective scale of moral development. Gilligan considered it as a masculine perspective on morality, founded on justice and abstract duties or obligations. Dana Ward has stated, in a paper that appears never to have been formally published for critical peer review, that the scale is psychometrically sound.Ward, Dana (2000). \\"Still Hearing Voice: The Persistent Myth of Gendered Judgment,\\" Keynote address presented at the VIIIth Biennial conference of the International Society for Justice Research, Rishon LeZion, Israel. Gilligan's In a Different Voice offered the perspective that men and women have tendencies to view morality in different terms. Her theory claimed women tended to emphasize empathy and compassion over the notions of morality that are privileged in Kohlberg's scale.Gilligan, Carol. In A Different Voice, Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1982) Subsequent research suggests that the discrepancy in being oriented towards care-based or justice-based ethical approaches may be based on gender differences, or on differences in actual current life situations of the genders.Ford and Lowery (1986). \\"Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning: A Comparison of the Use of Justice and Care Orientations\\". Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. 50(4), 777-783; Rothbart, Hanley and Albert (1986). \\"Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning.\\" Sex Roles. 15 (11&12), 645-653; and Krebs, D.L., Vermeulen, S.C., Denton, K., and Carpendale, J. I. (1994). \\"Gender and perspective differences in moral judgment and moral orientation\\". Journal of Moral Education. 23, 17-26. Relationship to traditional ethical positions Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as consequentialist theories (e.g. utilitarianism) and deontological theories (e.g. Kantian ethics) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values which, proponents of care ethics contend, are absent in such traditional models of ethics. One of these values is the placement of caring and relationship over that of logic and reason. In care ethics reason and logic are subservient to natural care, that is care that is done out of inclination, which is contrary to deontology where actions taken out of inclination are unethical. Care ethics as feminist ethics While some feminists have criticized care-based ethics for reinforcing traditional stereotypes of a \\"good woman\\" others have embraced parts of this paradigm under the theoretical concept of care-focused feminism. Care-focused feminism, alternatively called gender feminism, is a branch of feminist thought informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by Carol Gilligan and Nel Noddings. This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially engendered, being assigned to women and consequently devalued. \\"Care-focused feminists regard women's capacity for care as a human strength\\" which can and should be taught to and expected of men as well as women. Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma, than an ethic of justice.Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984. Noddings' care-focused feminism requires practical application of relational ethics, predicated on an ethic of care.Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989. Ethics of care is also a basis for care-focused feminist theorizing on maternal ethics. These theories recognize caring as an ethically relevant issue.Held, Virginia. Ethics of Care, page 64. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006. Critical of how society engenders caring labor, theorists Sara Ruddick, Virginia Held, and Eva Feder Kittay suggest caring should be performed and care givers valued in both public and private spheres.Kittay, Eva Feder: Love's Labor: Essays on Women, Equality and Dependency, page 20. Routledge, New York, 1999. This proposed paradigm shift in ethics encourages the view that an ethic of caring be the social responsibility of both men and women. Joan Tronto argues that the definition of the term \\"ethic of care\\" is ambiguous due in part to the lack of a central role it plays in moral theory. She argues that considering moral philosophy is engaged with human goodness, then care would appear to assume a significant role in this type of philosophy. However, this is not the case and Tronto further stresses the association between care and \\"naturalness\\". The latter term refers to the socially and culturally constructed gender roles where care is mainly assumed to be the role of the woman. As such, care loses the power to take a central role in moral theory. Tronto states there are four ethical qualities of care: #Attentiveness Attentiveness is crucial to the ethics of care because care requires a recognition of others' needs in order to respond to them. The question which arises is the distinction between ignorance and inattentiveness. Tronto poses this question as such, \\"But when is ignorance simply ignorance, and when is it inattentiveness\\"? #Responsibility In order to care, we must take it upon ourselves, thus responsibility. The problem associated with this second ethical element of responsibility is the question of obligation. Obligation is often, if not already, tied to pre- established societal and cultural norms and roles. Tronto makes the effort to differentiate the terms \\"responsibility\\" and \\"obligation\\" with regards to the ethic of care. Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract. This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles. #Competence To provide care also means competency. One cannot simply acknowledge the need to care, accept the responsibility, but not follow through with enough adequacy - as such action would result in the need of care not being met. #Responsiveness This refers to the \\"responsiveness of the care receiver to the care\\". Tronto states, \\"Responsiveness signals an important moral problem within care: by its nature, care is concerned with conditions of vulnerability and inequality\\". She further argues responsiveness does not equal reciprocity. Rather, it is another method to understand vulnerability and inequality by understanding what has been expressed by those in the vulnerable position, as opposed to re- imagining oneself in a similar situation. In 2013, Tronto added a fifth ethical quality: #Plurality, communication, trust and respect; solidarity ‚Äî caring with Together, these are the qualities necessary for people to come together in order to take collective responsibility, to understand their citizenship as always imbricated in relations of care, and to take seriously the nature of caring needs in society.

After working as a traveling salesman he joined the Militia, Australia's part-time military force, in 1923, starting out as an enlisted soldier before being commissioned as an officer. By 1939, having served with several infantry units, he had reached the rank of major. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Hammer volunteered for overseas service and fought in Greece, North Africa, New Guinea and Bougainville. He remained in the military after the war, rising to command at divisional level before retiring in 1959. He died in 1961 at the age of 56. Early years and personal life Hammer was born on 15 February 1905 in Southern Cross, Western Australia. His father, William, was a miner, and after his parents moved to Victoria, he lived in Bendigo, where he attended the School of Mines. Following his education he was employed as a travelling salesman. On 26 October 1935, he married Mary Frances Morrissey at St Patrick's Catholic Cathedral, Melbourne. The couple had two children ‚Äì a son and daughter ‚Äì but were divorced in 1955. Hammer later remarried, taking Helena Irena Olova, n√©e Vymazal, an Austrian, as his second wife. Military career Hammer enlisted in the Militia in 1923, serving initially in the ranks. In 1926, he was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 8th Infantry Battalion. By 1939, he had achieved the rank of major, having also served in the 17th Light Horse (Machine Gun) Regiment. Following the outbreak of the war, he joined the Second Australian Imperial Force on 8 June 1940, volunteering for overseas service. After a series of regimental postings, including brigade major of 16th Brigade, which was part of the 6th Division, Hammer was sent to the Middle East in 1941. After serving in Greece, the following year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the 2/48th Battalion, the most decorated Australian infantry battalion of the war. Hammer led the unit in the fighting at the Second Battle of El Alamein from July 1942, planning and executing the capture of Trig 29 on 26 July. In the last attack launched by the division on 30/31 October the 2/48th Infantry Battalion was ordered to take a position known as the Cloverleaf. During the attack, Hammer sustained a gunshot wound to his right cheek. The German bullet pieced his cheek and exited through to the other side, but did not touch any bones or teeth. At the same time he took two German prisoners. With only 41 of his men remaining, he withdrew and by dawn they had dug in. He continued to command the 2/48th Infantry Battalion until it was withdrawn from the Middle East and brought back to Australia in early 1943. In January 1943, he was invested with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions in the Middle East.Distinguished Service Order (DSO), 11 February 1943, It's an Honour, Citation: ARMY ‚Äî Middle East In June 1943, Hammer was promoted to brigadier and given command of the 15th Brigade.

It is named for the Etna volcano in eastern Sicily. It has a keen sense of smell, and is used to hunt small game, particularly rabbits. DNA studies The Cirneco dell'Etna shows similarity to other Mediterranean island hunting hounds such as the Podenco Ibicenco of the Balearic Islands and the Kelb tal-Fenek of Malta. A DNA study found that the Cirneco dell'Etna and the Kelb tal-Fenek have separate genetic identities, however there was evidence of gene flow from the Podenco Canario into the Cirneco dell'Etna. A further DNA analysis of the Cirneco dell'Etna and the Kelb tal-Fenek indicate that their separate breed formation occurred within the last 200 years, however the genetic foundations of these breeds date to the more distant past.  History  One newspaper article purports that the Cirneco is believed to be an ancient breed. The word \\"cirneco\\" derives from the , related to Cyrenaica in North Africa; the second part of the name relates to the area of the Etna volcano in Sicily, where the dogs originated. The earliest written description of the breed was by Maurizio Migneco, a veterinary surgeon from Adrano on the slopes of Etna, who published an account in Il Cacciatore Italiano in 1932. This was seen by a Sicilian noblewoman, Agata Patern√≥ Castello, who bought some of the dogs and in 1934 started breeding them. The breed was recognised by the Ente Nazionale della Cinofilia Italiana in 1939, based on a breed standard drawn up by Giuseppe Solaro of Turin. The Cirneco was definitively accepted by the F√©d√©ration Cynologique Internationale in 1956. It is a rare breed; in the period from 2010 to 2018, new registrations in Italy were between about 100 and 150 per year.

The Battle of Waynesboro was an American Civil War battle fought on December 4, 1864, towards the end of Sherman's March to the Sea. Union cavalry forces under Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick defeated Confederate cavalry led by Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler, opening the way for William T. Sherman's armies to approach their objective, Savannah. As Sherman's infantry marched southeast through Georgia, his cavalry under Judson Kilpatrick rode northeastward. In the late afternoon of November 26, 1864, elements of the Kilpatrick's 3rd Cavalry Division had reached the wooden railroad bridge north of Waynesboro, Georgia, and partially burned it before being driven off by troops dispatched from the Cavalry Corps of the Army of Tennessee by Joseph Wheeler. After the numerically inferior Confederates withdrew, Kilpatrick entered Waynesboro the next day and destroyed a train of cars and much private property before being driven from the town by Wheeler. At dawn on November 28, Wheeler suddenly attacked Kilpatrick's camp south of Waynesboro and drove him southwest beyond Buckhead Creek toward Louisville. Annoyed by Wheeler's constant harassment, Kilpatrick set out on the morning of December 4 with his full division to attack Waynesboro and finally destroy Wheeler's small command. Early in the morning, Kilpatrick, now supported by two infantry brigades dispatched from Baird's division of the XIV Corps, advanced from Thomas's Station six miles northward to burn the bridges over Brier Creek north and east of Waynesboro. Finding Wheeler's Confederates deployed astride the road, Kilpatrick attacked, driving the Confederate skirmishers in front of them. The Union force then came up against a strong defensive line of barricades, which they eventually overran. As the Union advance continued, they encountered even more barricades that required additional time to overcome. After hard fighting, Wheeler's outnumbered force retired into Waynesboro and another line of barricades hastily erected in the town's streets. There, Wheeler ordered a charge by Texas and Tennessee troops in order to gain time to withdraw across Brier Creek and block the road to Augusta, which, at the time, appeared to be the objective of General Sherman's army. After furious fighting, the Union troops broke through and Wheeler‚Äôs force hastily withdrew. Finally reaching his objective of Brier Creek, Kilpatrick burned the rail and wagon bridges and withdrew. The supporting infantry brigades marched toward Jacksonboro and rejoined the rest of Baird's division, encamped at Alexander. They were followed that evening by Kilpatrick's command, which camped at Old Church on the old Quaker Road. Additional fighting over the next few days enabled Sherman to close in on Savannah.

Pollard.  Plot  Set in the year 1873, professional gambler Stubby Preston arrives in the Wild West town of Salt Flats, Utah with plans to work the local casino but is arrested by the sheriff the moment he steps off the stagecoach. What Stubby doesn't know is that a group of locals have planned a vigilante attack on the casino that night, which the sheriff plans to turn a blind eye to. The only criminals to survive are those who were in the jail when it happened: Stubby, a pregnant prostitute named Bunny, a disturbed but gentle black man named Bud, and an alcoholic named Clem. In the morning the sheriff sees the four safely out of the town and gives them a wagon and horses in exchange for Stubby's $1000 stake. The four set out together, and Stubby suggests they head for Sun City, 200 miles South. Along the way, they meet up with a group of Quaker immigrants, whose patriarch mistakes the pregnant Bunny as Stubby's wife. Stubby and Bunny play along, then continue the ruse during the rest of their journey. The Quakers go their own way, and shortly after, the four witness a violent bandit raid on some unfortunate settlers. Bunny's birthday happens, and the four stop by a river. Bud catches a fish, a cake is fashioned from the sand, and Stubby offers up some canteened water as a toast. The toast is interrupted by gunshots, and the spit cooking the fish is neatly destroyed. Demonstrating his accuracy with a gun, a wanderer named Chaco invites himself to their group. Stubby is immediately suspicious, but for a while things go well. Three gunmen approach and Chaco saves the group from them, but the gunmen turn out to be lawmen and Chaco tortures the surviving deputy. Despite this, the group accepts the peyote buttons Chaco gives them one night by the campfire. Stubby chews some, but spits out most, retaining his senses when Chaco uses the promise of whiskey to persuade Clem to tie them up...starting with Stubby. Stubby resists But is thwarted by Chaco, who binds Stubby and Bud together, and Bunny to a tree. Chaco rapes Bunny, taunts Stubby, then tells Clem to ‚Äúbe quick about it‚Äù if he wants to rape Bunny also and go with Chaco. Clem realizes what he did and tries to stop Chaco, who shoots Clem in the leg and leaves them all for dead. Clem manages to free Stubby, who frees the others, then Bud builds a stretcher for Clem, and the four set out again. Chaco and his cohorts pick up and follow their trail. Chaco is about to discover them when his friends call out that they spotted a caravan of ‚Äòbible- folk‚Äô they can get supplies from, and the bandits set of after them. Stubby and the others later come across the remains of the caravan and the immigrants they met earlier. Chaco killed them all, and Stubby vows a second time to kill Chaco. Caught in a rainstorm, the four take shelter in a ghost town where they remove the bullet from Clem's leg. Clem later dies from infection. This sends the already fragile minded Bud into a mad and confused state. Stubby and Bunny admit love to each other and have sex. Later Bud returns with meat he managed to find which they all cook and eat. Bud shows the extent of his madness by insisting that the residents of the ghost town have been coming out to meet him every night. When Stubby discovers the meat came from the corpse of Clem, Stubby and Bunny decide to leave Bud to his friends the ghosts as there is nothing they can do for him. On the road, the two run into an old pastor friend of Stubby's shortly before Bunny goes into pained labor. Rushing to a snowy, mountaintop mining town populated entirely by men, the local chauvinistic townsmen are disturbed that a woman is giving birth in their home, but as they discuss it become fascinated and excited that their town would give new life instead of just taking it. Bunny dies in childbirth which leaves Stubby in shock. The townsmen, now enraptured with the child, gather round and take care him and insist that the pastor perform a baptism. Needing a name, the most enthusiastic townsman names the child Lucky. This awakens Stubby from his shock and he gratefully grants guardianship of Lucky to the townsmen. Now alone, Stubby heads out and to seek revenge on Chaco. He spots the wagon the sheriff of Salt Flats had ‚Äòsold‚Äô him, and finds his shaving gear still in it. Chaco and his two friends are holding up in a barn. Stubby quickly kills two of the bandits and taunts and tortures a wounded Chaco, who taunts back by holding up the dead evangelist's cross and reminding him of Bunny's rape. Stubby shoots Chaco dead without another word, and heads off into the horizon after welcoming a stray dog to join him.

At the time of his death, federal prosecutors planned to indict him for numerous crimes, including murder.\\"The Deepest Family Secret,\\" Chuck Goudie, ABC News, Chicago It is believed he had participated in, or had knowledge of, many murders going back decades, including brothers Anthony \\"Tony the Ant\\" Spilotro and Michael Spilotro, Allen Dorfman of the Teamsters Union, a disgraced Chicago cop, Outfit associate and informant Dick Cain, Outfit boss Salvatore \\"Sam,\\" \\"Mooney\\" Giancana, loanshark Sam \\"Mad Sam\\" DeStefano, Outfit hitman Charles \\"Chuckie\\" Nicoletti and others. Schweihs had been convicted of extortion in 1989 and was sentenced to 13-years-and-one-month in prison and was ordered to pay $42,900 in fines and restitution. Schweihs operated with several crews, one of them the \\"Chinatown Crew\\" also known as the \\"26th Street Crew.\\" Its operations were run out of the Old Neighborhood Italian American Club, originally on west 26th Street, in Chicago. Its founder, Angelo J. \\"The Hook\\" LaPietra, and Schweihs' partner skimmed $2 Million from Las Vegas casinos in the 1980s and built a new massive club structure on west 31st Street, in Chicago. In 1991, Schweihs collected $12,000 a month from the On Leong, in Chinatown, to allow them to run their casino there. The money was delivered to the Italian Club. The last known city of residence of Schweihs was Dania Beach, Florida, before he became a fugitive in April 2005. He was a fugitive along with Joseph \\"Joey the Clown\\" Lombardo, who each went their separate ways; however, Schweihs was eventually caught in Berea, Kentucky, on December 16, 2005, and less than a month later, Lombardo was caught on January 13, 2006, in the Chicago area. Schweihs' trial was separated from the other defendants' because of his poor health (he had cancer). His co-defendants were convicted in the original trial in 2007. Schweihs remained in jail pending his trial. After his health had been judged to have improved, he was finally scheduled to go on trial in October 2008. Schweihs died on July 23, 2008, from complications related to his cancer. Schweihs' daughter, Nora Schweihs, is a castmember of Mob Wives Chicago. She had her father's body exhumed in July 2012 in order to prove the corpse's identity. Schweihs' remains were eventually cremated.

Once a rural area, this changed in 1940 with the establishment of the Salisbury Explosives factory, followed by the Long Range Weapons Establishment (LRWE) in 1947, the High Speed Aerodynamics Laboratory, Propulsion Research Laboratory and the Electronics Research Laboratory, (collectively known as the Chemistry & Physics Research Laboratory) in 1949, and the establishment of the RAAF base in 1955. The LWRE and laboratories became the Weapons Research Establishment (WRE) in 1955, the Defence Science & Technology Organisation (DSTO) in 1974, and the DST Group in 2015.

Individuals with this condition will develop papules. Those diagnosed with this disease may also develop complications due to impairment of internal organs. The exact underlying mechanism is still unknown, and an effective treatment is still being developed. There are fewer than 50 living patients presently known worldwide, and fewer than 200 reported in medical literature. However, many individuals may go undiagnosed due to rarity of the disease. Most individuals develop symptoms between the ages of 20‚Äì50; however, cases outside of this age range have been reported as well. Symptoms and signs The characteristic symptom of Degos disease is the development of papules. Initially, individuals may have skin lesions or rashes, but they will proceed to develop distinct bumps, or papules. Papules are circular in shape, have a porcelain-white center and red border. As papules age, the white centers will skin in and only the border will remain raised. Typically, papules range from 0.5 to 1 cm in width. Papules appear on the trunk and upper extremities and are not found on the individual's palms, soles, scalp, or face. Symptoms vary, depending on whether an individual has the benign variant or malignant variant of the disease. Both the benign and malignant forms have development of the characteristic papules. Individuals with the benign form will have the typical papules persisting anywhere from a few years to throughout their whole lives. In the benign form, no inner organs are affected. If an individual develops the malignant form, it means that not only are the papules present, but inner organs are involved. Most malignant cases involve problems of the gastrointestinal tract leading to small intestine lesions, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bowel perforation. If the central nervous system is involved, symptoms can include headaches, dizziness, seizures, paralysis of cranial nerves, weakness, stroke, damage to small areas of the brain due to artery blockage (cerebral infarcts, and cerebral hemorrhage). Additional organs commonly impacted include the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Symptoms that may develop from damage to these organs include double vision (diplopia), clouding of lenses of eyes, swelling of the optic disc (papilledema), partial loss of vision, shortness of breath, chest pain, epilepsy, and thickening of pericardium. Someone with the benign form may suddenly develop symptoms of the malignant form. Symptoms can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. Onset of symptoms typically begins to manifest between the ages of 20‚Äì50. A few cases of this condition in newborns have also been described.  Causes  The papules characteristic for this disease develop due to infarctions, or blockages in small-medium arteries and veins. The underlying cause is unknown for this disease. Though not confirmed, some cases have shown signs of inheritance between first-degree relatives. It has been suggested that the disease has a familial inheritance pattern; it is thought to be an autosomal dominant disorder. In most cases of familial inheritance, the benign variant of the disease has been present. Due to the lack of knowledge of the pathomechanism for this condition prevention strategies are not known. However, in order to prevent worsening of symptoms, consistent evaluations should be conducted by a physician.  Mechanism  Although this disease has been known for around 70 years, the pathomechanism underlying it is still unknown. Several hypotheses have been developed regarding the underlying mechanism for Degos disease. One theory suggests that inflammation of blood vessels may trigger the condition. Another theory has to do with Degos disease as a coagulopathy. Development of a thrombus and resulting reduction of blood flow is common in this condition. A reduction in blood flow throughout the body can lead to damaged endothelial cells and may perhaps lead to the formation of the characteristic papules. Another hypothesis suggests that abnormal swelling and proliferation of the vascular endothelium can lead to intestinal and central nervous system thrombosis, and ultimately lead to development of symptoms associated with Degos disease. Overall, individuals with Degos disease have abnormal blockages in their arteries and veins; however, the cause of these blockages is unknown.  Diagnosis  Clinical evaluation and identification of characteristics papules may allow a dermatologist to diagnose Degos disease. The papules have a white center and are bordered with a red ring. After lesions begin to appear, the diagnosis for Degos disease can be supported by histological findings. Most cases will show a wedge-shaped connective tissue necrosis in the deep corium. This shape is due to the blockage/occlusion of small arteries. Individuals may be diagnosed with the benign form if only the papules are present. However, an individual may be diagnosed with the malignant form if involvement of other organs like the lungs, intestine and/or central nervous system occurs. The malignant, or systematic form of this condition may suddenly develop even after having papules present for several years. In order to quickly diagnose this shift to the malignant variant of the disease, it is important for individuals to have consistent follow-up evaluations. In these evaluations, depending on which organs are suspected to be involved, the following procedures and tests may be conducted: skin inspection, brain magnetic resonance tomography, colonoscopy, chest X-ray, and/or abdominal ultrasound.  Treatment  Due to the lack of knowledge around the underlying mechanism of malignant atrophic papulosis, an effective treatment method has not been developed. Treatment for this condition is symptomatic. However, several treatment methods have been tested and are still being developed as more information regarding the condition is found. Fibrinolytic and immunosuppressive therapeutic regimens were tested and found to be mostly unsuccessful as treatment methods. After treating conditions comorbid with Degos disease, physicians have recently found improvement in symptoms with the use of eculizumab and treprostinil. Discovered by dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro, response to eculizumab is often immediate and dramatic, but has been of limited duration and is expensive, needing to be infused every 14 days. Treprostinil use has been reported to result in clearing of gastrointestinal and central nervous system findings as well as clearing of cutaneous lesions, but reports are limited. Treprostinil may be more effective than other vasodilators because it may also increase the population of circulating endothelial cells, allowing angiogenesis.  Recent research  A 46-year-old male patient was diagnosed with the malignant, systemic form of the disease and was severely ill. The diagnosing dermatopathologist, Cynthia Magro MD, identified the presence of C5b-9 complexes in the involved vessels of the skin biopsy. For treatment of the thrombotic microangiopathy in this patient, she suggested the use of eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody drug developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals and approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. The patient experienced a dramatic improvement in his condition. Lee Shapiro MD and Aixa Toledo-Garcia MD at Albany Medical College learned of the success with the adult patient, and became the first physicians to successfully treat a pediatric Degos patient with eculizumab. Dr. Shapiro later observed the resolution of Degos skin lesions in an adult patient with an overlap syndrome involving systemic lupus, systemic sclerosis, and Degos disease who was treated with treprostinil for her pulmonary hypertension. His pediatric Degos patient was developing significant complications despite treatment with eculizumab, so Dr. Shapiro's group became the first to treat a Degos patient with treprostinil. To this point, all known long-term survivors of systemic Degos disease are being treated with a combination of eculizumab and treprostinil.  History  In 1941, this disease was first described by Kohlmeier. However, it was not until 1942 that the disease was recognized as a new clinical entity by Robert Degos. Initially the condition was referred to as Degos Disease or Kohlmeier-Degos disease. However, Degos himself subsequently suggested the name \\"papulose atrophiante maligne,\\" translated as malignant atrophic papulosis.

Before 1933, the year of the NSDAP's seizure of power, he was judicially sentenced many times for political misdeeds. However, after Hitler and the NSDAP had come to power, Wei√ü organized the \\"equalization\\" of the press, though he also saw to it that individual journalists could keep their jobs despite the Editor Law (Schriftleitergesetz).

Basil Boioannes (, called Bugiano in Italian, was the Byzantine catapan of Italy (1017Catherine Holmes, University College, Oxford - Roman Emperors DIR Basil II. ‚Äì 1027Chalandon, Ferdinand. Histoire de la domination normande en Italie et en Sicile. Paris, 1907.) and one of the greatest Byzantine generals of his time. His accomplishments enabled the Empire to reestablish itself as a major force in southern Italy after centuries of decline. Yet, the Norman adventurers introduced into the power structure of the Mezzogiorno would be the eventual beneficiaries. Life Upon his appointment by Emperor Basil II in December 1017, he immediately requested reinforcements from Constantinople to fight the insurgency of the Lombard general Melus of Bari and his Norman soldiery. The request was granted: a detachment of the elite Varangian Guard was sent. The two forces met on the river Ofanto near Cannae, the site of Hannibal's victory over the Romans in 216 BC. In the second Battle of Cannae, Boioannes achieved an equally decisive victory. Boioannes protected his gains by immediately building a great fortress at the Apennine pass guarding the entrance to the Apulian plain. Troia, named after the ancient city of Asia Minor, was garrisoned by Boioannes' own contingent of Norman troops in 1019. Soon, all the Mezzogiorno had submitted to Byzantine authority, with the exception of the Duchy of Benevento, which remained faithful to the Papacy. Frightened by the shift in momentum in the south, Pope Benedict VIII went north in 1020 to Bamberg to confer with the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry II. The Emperor took no immediate action, but events of the next year convinced him to intervene. Boioannes and his new ally Prince Pandulf IV of Capua marched on Melus' brother-in-law Dattus and captured his tower on the Garigliano. On 15 June, Dattus was tied up in a sack with a monkey, a rooster, and a snake and thrown into the sea. The next year, in response, a huge imperial army marched south to attack the new fortress of Troia. The garrison held out and never fell. Boioannes granted the town privileges for its loyalty. In 1025, Boioannes was preparing to lead a Sicilian expedition with Basil II when the great emperor died. Constantine VIII, his co-ruler and successor, cancelled the expedition, and the catapan went north to aid Pandulf in retaking Capua, which Henry II had captured three years earlier. Boioannes offered the new prince of Capua, Pandulf of Teano, safe passage to Naples and accepted his surrender in May 1026. This was to be his last major campaign. In 1027, he was recalled. His replacements hardly lived up to the standard of military effectiveness he set. During the next century, Byzantine influence in Italy steadily declined to nil. In 1041, Boioannes' son Exaugustus was named catapan, but he did not last a year in that post. Sources *Norwich, John Julius. The Normans in the South 1016‚Äì1130. Longmans: London, 1967.

Washington High School is a high school in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was named after the African-American education pioneer Booker T. Washington. It is one of eleven high schools in the Tulsa Public Schools system. Overview Booker T. Washington is a public high school that accepts students based upon their academic merit, rather than their geographical location. The school uses applicants' middle school grades and attendance record, as well as their Iowa Tests of Educational Development scores, to determine admission. To ensure greater ethnic, economic, and intellectual diversity, students who live in historically minority and economically depressed neighborhoods are offered preferential consideration. History Oklahoma statehood brought about segregated schools for African-American children. The first such school in Tulsa was a two-room wooden building built in 1908 on Hartford Avenue, between Cameron and Easton Streets. It served grades 1 through 8 until 1913. In that year, Dunbar Grade School opened at 504 Easton Street in an 18-room brick building, with a four-room frame building that served as a high school.Historic Tulsa Blogspot. \\"Booker T. Washington High School, 1913.\\" September 3, 2009. Booker T. Washington High School was founded in 1913, with a class of fourteen students and a staff of two teachers. The principal was E.W. Woods, a native of Louisville, Mississippi, who had just moved to Tulsa from Memphis, Tennessee. According to legend, Woods walked all the way from Tennessee to Oklahoma when he learned the new school was advertising for a principal. The original school building was at the corner of Elgin Avenue and Easton Street, in the Greenwood district of Tulsa.Hirsch, James S. Riot and Remembrance: The Tulsa Race War and its Legacy. 2002. . By 1920, the four-room high school had been replaced by a three-story brick building. This continued to operate for nearly three decades. Original building, Booker T. Washington High School in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Tulsa Race Massacre The high school escaped destruction during the Tulsa Race Riot of 1921. Immediately after the massacre, the American Red Cross used the building as its headquarters for relief activities. About 2,000 people were temporarily sheltered there. A hospital facility was set up, along with a dental clinic, a venereal disease clinic, and a medical dispensary. The Red Cross inoculated about 1,800 refugees against tetanus, typhoid and smallpox. Desegregation The Tulsa Public Schools district was slow to react to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that de jure racial segregation was unconstitutional in the Brown v. Board of Education decision in 1954, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which outlawed all racial segregation in the United States. During the 1971-72 school year a small number of progressive Caucasian students voluntarily transferred to Booker T. Washington in a special program called \\"Metro.\\" The program was successful as a proof that voluntary desegregation would work at Booker T. Washington High. In 1973 Booker T. Washington was chosen to be the vehicle for Tulsa‚Äôs school desegregation program. Tulsa was - and still is - racially divided along north-south lines, and the school was in historically African- American north Tulsa, making this the first integration program in a historically African-American school. The Tulsa School Board established a system of desegregation busing. As part of this policy, Booker T. Washington became a magnet school; it no longer had a home neighborhood from which students were accepted. Students instead had to apply for admission and were drawn from across the district. A racial quota system was established and, until the 2004-2005 school year, 45% of the students accepted identified themselves as \\"white,\\" 45% as \\"black,\\" and 10% came from other ethnic categories. However, in 2003, the Supreme Court ruled in Grutter v. Bollinger and Gratz v. Bollinger that quota systems constituted racial discrimination and violated the Constitution. Booker T. Washington High School accepted the ruling and eliminated their quota system in favor of a system based on geography. Due to Tulsa's regional demographics, this system is calibrated to maintain a similar racial distribution to the old quota system. Present day The fourth home of the Booker T. Washington High School opened at 1631 E. Woodrow Place in September 1950, graduating its first class in 1951. That building was replaced by a new one at the same location in 2003. Booker T. Washington was one of the first Tulsa public high schools to offer Advanced Placement courses and began offering the International Baccalaureate program in 1983. The 2003-2004 school year marked the 90th anniversary of Booker T. Washington and the dedication of a new $25 million, school building. This building was designed to encompass the rich heritage of the school and tried to incorporate many themes from the previous facility. A portion of the original building has been preserved. Academics and administration Booker T. Washington is accredited by the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO) to grant the IB Diploma to students who complete the two-year programme. Booker T. also offers Advanced Placement courses, with the exception of AP Italian Language and Culture and AP United States Government and Politics. Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses are taught in English, math, social studies, science, computer health, foreign language, and the arts. Booker T. Washington High School was part of a study by the Education Trust and the ACT. Published in 2005, On Course for Success focused on high performing, diversely populated schools that provide students with college-preparatory courses, qualified teachers, flexible teaching styles, and extra tutorial support. The study identified specific academic skills that should to be taught to high school students to prepare graduates for college. The study focused on English, math, and science courses, and claimed that Booker T. Washington was \\"doing things right.\\"On Course for Success , ACT 2005. The school offers eight world languages: Spanish, French, German, Latin, Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Russian. All are offered through level V. In 2005, 81% of the student body was enrolled in a world language, and 10% was enrolled in a level IV language class or higher. Booker T. Washington has active exchange programs with China, Japan, Russia, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay, Venezuela, India, and many European countries. In 2010, Booker T.

It is set in post-revolutionary Cairo during the time of Gamal Abdel Nasser. Plot summary The book opens with the main character Omar going to visit a doctor, who was one of his friends from his youth, because he has become sick of life. The doctor tells him that there is nothing physically wrong with him, and tells him that he won‚Äôt be ill if he goes on a diet and takes regular exercise. Both the diet and a vacation make no difference to him though. In his youth Omar was a poet and a socialist. He gave up both in order to become a lawyer, and now that he has reached the age of forty-five he can no longer find meaning in his life and he has effectively given up working. He met his wife Zeinab in his youth. She was a Christian called Kamelia Fouad and she converted to Islam, and lost her family in order to marry him. He promised that he would never desert her. She took up the role of supporting him and has proved to be the backbone of their bourgeois life together. As his malady grows he becomes more distant from her. He tries to escape his condition through love. He first meets a foreign singer called Margaret. When she unexpectedly leaves Egypt, he gets together with an oriental dancer called Warda. He falls in love with her, and she with him and they set up home together. Initially Omar‚Äôs illness seems to pass in the excitement of love. Zeinab, who is pregnant, is first suspicious and then is told of his new lover. Omar moves out to be with Warda, who quits her job to be with him. This love however fails to lift him out of his illness for long, and he makes contact with Margaret again when he sees her back at her club. He then goes through a succession of women, including prostitutes, trying to pull himself out of his sickness, but it is all to no avail. One dawn he is out near the pyramids and he feels a momentary joy, which connects him to all life. He feels light and at peace, but he soon feels the illness again. Although he tries to win this feeling again he is never able to. He returns home but feels suffocated there. One day Othman Khalil turns up in his office. Othman had been his socialist comrade in his youth who had been caught by the police, but hadn‚Äôt given out his connections with Omar, despite having been tortured. He has only just been released from prison. Othman is disconcerted to find Omar as a sceptic, as he has hung onto all of his socialist orthodoxies. As writing poetry has also failed to cure him, in an attempt to regain the peace he felt by the pyramids, Omar goes off to live by himself in the countryside. He slips into delirium but still the calm he desires escapes him. After a year and a half Othman, who has got involved in politics again, turns up at the house escaping from the police, but Omar thinks he is an illusion. Omar is shot and wounded as the police catch Othman. Omar feels he is returning to the world as he is brought back to Cairo.

The script was loosely based on an actual OSS Detachment 101 incident recorded in a 1957 novel by Tom T. Chamales. Sinatra's character of Captain Tom Reynolds is based on a real OSS officer and, later, sheriff of Sangamon County, Illinois, U.S. Navy Lt. Meredith Rhule. Plot In 1943 Burma, a unit of American and British forces under the Office of Strategic Services joins with the native Kachin to hold back the Japanese Army. The unit, under the joint command of American captain Tom C. Reynolds and British captain Danny De Mortimer (Richard Johnson), with guidance from Kachin leader Nautaung (Philip Ahn), remains frustrated by their grueling duty, limited supplies and lack of medical care. After an ambush mission during which the unit wipes out a Japanese squad, Tom's aide, Bye Ya, is severely wounded. Knowing that because they have no morphine Bye Ya (Guy Lee) will die a lingering, painful death, Tom shoots him and then angrily contacts army headquarters in Calcutta and demands to meet with his commanding officer. That evening at dinner, the men run into the OSS regional commanding officer Col. Fred Parkson (Robert Bray), who introduces them to wealthy merchant Nikko Regas (Paul Henreid) and his girlfriend, Carla Vesari (Gina Lollobrigida). Tom is immediately attracted to Carla and asks her to dance, but she mocks his provincial American background. As he departs, Nikko invites the men to his country place at the base of the Himalayan Mountains. The next day at headquarters, Tom demands a doctor for the unit but Parkson informs him that medical officers are in short supply and it will be their responsibility to secure a doctor. After Parkson then unexpectedly orders the men to take two weeks leave, Tom refuses unless the Kachin are also officially provided leave. When Parkson agrees, Tom asks to have Ringa reassigned as his new aide, as he likes the corporal's ingenuity and fearlessness. Tom, Danny and Ringa drive to Cowaga and upon arriving at their hotel receive a note from Nikko, inviting them to a party. At the party, Tom seeks out Carla and despite her cool attitude, asks to see her the next day. The following morning after horseback riding, Tom and Carla are joined by Danny for a tour of the Himalayan villages. During the tour, Danny falls ill and, upon returning to Nikko's house, is misdiagnosed as having typhus by military doctor Capt. Grey Travis (Peter Lawford). Danny insists that he is having a recurrence of malaria and after several tests, Travis reluctantly agrees. Nikko offers to put the men up until Danny recovers and, eager to be near Carla, Tom accepts. Noting Carla's attraction to Tom, Nikko cautions her of the unreliability of Americans. After Nikko departs for China, Carla spends more time with Tom, but continues to refuse his romantic overtures. Upon Danny's recovery, Tom informs Travis that he has had the doctor assigned to their unit as medical officer. Tom then surprises Carla by insisting that she leave Nikko because Tom intends to marry her. Tom and the others return to the Kachin hills in time to spend Christmas with the troops, but their celebration is interrupted when the Japanese unexpectedly attack and wound Tom. Ringa learns from a captured Japanese soldier that the strike was planned with inside information. Nautaung is dismayed when he discovers that one of his men, Billingsley, and a native Shan girl have betrayed them. When Nautaung orders the girl to be shot and Billingsley to be \\"put into the Circle\\" and ritually executed in accordance with Kachin custom, Travis protests vigorously, but Tom insists that the dangers of jungle warfare demand harsh measures. Travis then sends Tom and the other soldiers wounded in the attack to the air base hospital in Calcutta to recover. There, Parkson gives Tom new orders to destroy an airfield in Ubachi, near the Chinese border. When Tom objects that his small unit lacks the supplies to make a successful attack, Parkson assures him they will receive supplies from their Chinese allies. Later, Carla visits Tom and invites him to stay with her when he has recovered. The day before returning to the hills, Tom goes to see Carla, but is disappointed to find her in a luxurious hotel, which she admits is at Nikko's expense. Tom criticizes Carla's inability to put aside her desire for luxury and departs hurt and angered. Tom rejoins his unit and they proceed on their mission. When the supply convoy fails to arrive at the designated time, Tom decides they must go ahead with the attack anyway. Although the mission is successful, Nautaung and several Americans are killed. While making their way back, the unit comes across the destroyed convoy and finds evidence that indicates that renegade Chinese from across the border were responsible. Tom decides to pursue the renegades, despite Danny's protest. The men find the Chinese camp at nightfall and locating their supply tent, come upon several dozen American dog tags and personal effects. Shocked and outraged, Tom realizes the renegades have been killing American soldiers. Danny translates one of several Chinese warrants from the Chungking government authorizing independent military forces to defend China in and outside their borders against all foreign intruders, and stating that all confiscated materials will be split with Chungking. Tom rouses the Chinese in the camp and holds them under guard, but when he radios headquarters to report, he receives a message ordering his immediate return as the Chinese have lodged a complaint about his unit's incursion. While Tom consults with Danny about the prisoners, a Chinese soldier surprises them and kills Danny. Tom sends a message back to headquarters rebuffing their demand and orders Ringa to execute the prisoners. Upon returning to Burma, Tom promotes Ringa to Second Lieutenant and places him in operational command of the unit, then proceeds to Calcutta where he is placed under house arrest on a charge of murder. Carla visits Tom and confesses that she could not tell him earlier that Nikko is with intelligence and she is his assistant. Carla advises Tom to say that battle fatigue caused his defiant incursion into China, but he refuses. Later, Parkson and an officer from Washington, Gen. Sloan, visit Tom, who shows them one of the Chinese warrants. Sloan advises Tom not to mention the warrants and demands that he apologize to the representative of the Chinese government. Tom refuses and offers Sloan the American dog tags found at the renegade camp as his answer to anything Sloan and his people might say. A team of military psychiatrists are then brought in to examine Tom for a possible mental discharge, but Tom refuses to cooperate and admit to anything. The Chinese representative then arrives, and Sloan unexpectedly sides with Tom, demanding that the warlord who has killed American servicemen be reported and an apology issued from China to the U. S. Stung, the representative departs and Sloan reveals that the Chungking government had already sent an apology with a promise to investigate the murders. Exonerated, Tom is freed and reunites with Carla before returning to his Kachins. The film diverges from the novel here, in that Reynolds dies in the book but survives in the film and will presumably go on to marry Carla at some point after the war.

Rat Pack cohort Sammy Davis, Jr. was originally slated to play McQueen's role, but Sinatra yanked it away after Davis mildly criticized Sinatra during a radio interview. McQueen was mainly noted at the time for the television series Wanted: Dead or Alive and the horror movie The Blob. Never So Few marked his introduction to working with director John Sturges, who went on to cast McQueen in his breakout role the following year, as second lead in The Magnificent Seven, and later as the motorcycle-jumping lead in the classic The Great Escape. On the original US one-sheet theatrical poster (see infobox above), only Sinatra and Lollobrigida were top billed. As illustrated to the right, in the 1967 re-release McQueen's credit was moved in front of Peter Lawford's and above the title, and he was featured prominently in the artwork. In a similar move, Sinatra later recast the role of Rat Pack colleague Peter Lawford after Lawford failed to deliver his brother-in-law President John F. Kennedy for a stay at Sinatra's house, giving Lawford's part in Robin and the 7 Hoods to Bing Crosby, Kennedy's choice as host for his visit. Sinatra never spoke to Lawford again. Critical reception Opening to middling reviews, Never So Few was praised for its action sequences, but criticized for a romantic sub-plot that bogged the film down. Newcomer McQueen garnered the bulk of the film's good notice. Variety commented that \\"Steve McQueen has a good part, and he delivers with impressive style.\\" Box office According to MGM records the film was popular, earning $3,020,000 in the US and Canada and $2,250,000 elsewhere, but because of its high cost resulted in a loss of $1,155,000.

It was first shown to the public at the 2001 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan. History The Bengal was an attempt to rejuvenate the Buick line, and make it seem more appealing to younger people. It was powered by a supercharged 3.4L V6, which was mated to a six speed manual transmission. The transmission was mounted ahead of the engine, to allow a more forward placement of the front wheels to improve handling. Though a 2-seater roadster in general design, the rear decklid can be lifted to reveal two extra seats. One of the most desirable features of the Bengal is its voice activated controls. The car is able to distinguish over 100 commands given to it by voice, which can operate various things from the headlights, windshield wipers, and convertible top, to the heater, navigation system, seat adjustments, and cruise control. The system was named Quiet Servant and it was developed by Visteon Corporation. The dashboard is free of traditional gauges, everything instead is displayed on demand on a single flat panel screen. In 2001 Buick claimed they wanted to put the Bengal into production, but plans were shelved until 2004 when they revealed the Velite concept, which is a more realistic roadster design.

Her work encompasses sculpture, drawing, installation and text, and demonstrates a long-standing fascination with the emblem of fighter aircraft and their role within culture and especially as presented on film. She is well known for her early works in the form of 'wordscapes', written transcriptions of the frame-by-frame action in Hollywood war films, including Top Gun and Apocalypse Now. Her work has been exhibited in prominent international venues such as the Museum of Modern Art, New York and Hayward Gallery, London. Banner lives and works in London.

She studied at Kingston University and completed her MA at Goldsmiths College of Art in 1993. The next year she held her first solo exhibition at City Racing. Stonard, John-Paul. \\"Fiona Banner\\", Tate from text of Grove Art Online, 10 December 2000. Retrieved 13 June 2010. Since graduating from Goldsmiths College of Art, Banner has continued to evolve an important, considered and interrelated practice, rooted in language. Publishing, in the broadest sense, is central to her practice. In 1995, she was included in General Release: Young British Artists held at the XLVI Venice Biennale. Since 1994 Banner has created handwritten and printed texts - 'wordscapes' - that retell in her own words entire feature films, including Point Break (1991) and The Desert (1994), or particular scenarios in detail. Her work took the form of solid single blocks of text, often the same shape and size as a cinema screen. She also investigates the formal components of written language, giving significance to the symbols that punctuate sentences. In 1997, when she published THE NAM, she started working under the imprint of The Vanity Press, and has since published an extensive archive of books, objects and performances, many questioning the notion of authorship and copyright. For Banner, the act of publishing is itself a performative one.

THE NAM is a 1,000-page book which describes the plots of six Vietnam films in their entirety: the films are Apocalypse Now, Born on the Fourth of July, The Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill and Platoon. Following her shows at the , and Dundee Contemporary Arts, Banner was nominated for the Turner Prize in 2002. Since early 2000, Banner has been working with pornographic film as a basis for an exploration of our obsession with sex, and the extreme limits of written communication. In large, densely filled works she transcribe the varied sexual activities taking place in Asswoman in Wonderland, starring Tiffany Minx, who also directed this X-rated version of Alice's fictional adventures. Banner's own Arsewoman in Wonderland (2001), presented in the Turner Prize exhibition, is a 4 x 6 m printed description of the film pasted and layered sheet after sheet onto the wall like and overladen billboard. 'I wanted to make some work about sex but I couldn't describe it. I was too close to it and I did not have the words that close to hand. I looked again at ports as a way of investigating my own taboo. Just as with the war films I enjoyed it but found it hard to grasp; it was intimate yet distant, seductive yet sometimes repulsive. My response to the film was very emotional.' The Guardian asked, \\"It's art. But is it porn?\\" calling in \\"Britain's biggest porn star\\", Ben Dover, to comment.Brockes, Emma \\"It's art.

This test is often used to test for spondyloarthritis, sciatica, or other forms of rheumatism, and is often performed during checkup visits in patients who have been diagnosed with one of the former disorders. It is named after Frederick Julius Gaenslen, the orthopedic surgeon who invented the test. This test is often performed alongside Patrick's test and Yeoman's test. To perform Gaenslen's test, the hip joint is flexed maximally on one side and the opposite hip joint is extended, stressing both sacroiliac joints simultaneously. This is often done by having the patient lying on his or her back, lifting the knee to push towards the patient's chest while the other leg is allowed to fall over the side of an examination table, and is pushed toward the floor, flexing both sacroiliac joints. The test can also be performed with the patient in the lateral recumbent position. The patient lies with the involved side up and passively flexes the uninvolved hip as far as comfortable to their chest. The involved hip is taken into extension while stability is maintained in the pelvis. The test is considered positive if the patient experiences pain while this test is performed, and may indicate a need for further testing, such as an X-ray or lumbar CT scan.

Harcourt) The Fifth of March is a 1993 novel about the Boston Massacre (of March 5, 1770, pre-Revolutionary War) by historian and author Ann Rinaldi, who was also the author of many other historical fiction novels such as Girl in Blue and A Break with Charity. This book is about a fourteen-year-old indentured servant named Rachel Marsh who finds herself changing as she meets many people, including young Matthew Kilroy, a British private in the 29th regiment who is not very easy to get along with. She has a friend named Jane, who was her first ever friend. Plot Rachel Marsh, at age 14, is an indentured servant to John Adams, and his wife, Abigail Adams. Her father and mother have died, leaving Uncle Eb as her only living relative. However, Uncle Eb is greedy, uncaring, and often exploits Rachel. After a falling out over Uncle Eb wanting Rachel to spy on the Adamses, Uncle Eb disowns her. Rachel confides this to Abigail Adams, who comforts her and gives her money to go buy books at Henry Knox's bookstore. Rachel is inspired by Henry Knox and begins working to better her education. Later, a British ship arrives. Many Bostonians are unhappy with this new change and begin rioting. Nevertheless, the British post sentries outside of many residences, including the Adamses. While coming back from the bakery, the sentry outside of the Adamses house, Private Matthew Kilroy, challenges Rachel. She notices that he is fearful and hungry looking. Taking pity on him, she gives the freezing sentry a few scraps of food. As their friendship develops, Matthew begins pushing Rachel for more and wants her to kiss him. However, Rachel does not want to do so, and would rather remain friends. Their relationship is very tumultuous. Rachel's close friend, Jane, suddenly drags Rachel out of bed one night. Rachel follows Jane to find a mob of citizens fighting against the British soldiers. She sees Matthew shoot and stab a defenseless man. This event would be known as the Boston Massacre. Later, Matthew is accused of murder. Rachel sneaks food to Matthew, feeling pity for him. John Adams defends the British soldiers, but two of them, including Matthew, are accused of manslaughter. Matthew is branded and shipped back to England. Matthew proposes matrimony to Rachel but she refuses him. Mr. Adams feels that it would be best to let go of Rachel when they move back to Braintree. He gets Rachel a position in Philadelphia, which he thinks would suit her. She is about to begin a new chapter in her life.

Classification Gangliogliomas are generally benign WHO grade I tumors; the presence of anaplastic changes in the glial component is considered to represent WHO grade III (anaplastic ganglioglioma). Criteria for WHO grade II have been suggested, but are not established. Malignant transformation of spinal ganglioglioma has been seen in only a select few cases. Poor prognostic factors for adults with gangliogliomas include older age at diagnosis, male sex, and malignant histologic features. Histopathology Histologically, ganglioglioma is composed of both neoplastic glial and ganglion cells which are disorganized, variably cellular, and non-infiltrative. Occasionally, it may be challenging to differentiate ganglion cell tumors from an infiltrating glioma with entrapped neurons. The presence of neoplastic ganglion cells forming abnormal clusters, the presence of binucleation and dysmorphic neurons are helpful clues favoring ganglioglioma over glioma. The glial component of ganglioglioma includes fibrillary astrocytes with varying degrees of cellular atypia. The neoplastic neuronal components are often clustered or irregularly oriented. Fibrovascular stroma confined to the neuronal component, perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, and small foci of calcification are common, as is immunopositivity for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, and chromogranin A. Elevated Ki-67 and p53 labeling index is associated with more aggressive tumor behavior in both children and adults with gangliogliomas. The rare occurrence of malignant transformation is confined to the glial cell population, and is characterized by increased cellularity and mitotic activity, endothelial proliferation, and necrosis. Diagnosis Computed Tomography (CT) is generally not a recommended modality for diagnosis and evaluation of spinal cord tumors. Evaluation with Magnetic Resonance (MR) most commonly demonstrates a circumscribed solid or mixed solid and cystic mass spanning a long segment of the cord with hypointense T1 signal and hyperintense T2 signal in the solid component. Enhancement patterns are highly variable, ranging from minimal to marked, and may be solid, rim, or nodular. Adjacent cord edema and syringomyelia and peritumoral cysts may be present in addition to reactive scoliosis. It is nearly impossible to differentiate ganglioglioma from other more common intramedullary neoplasms based on imaging alone. Astrocytoma and ependymoma are more familiar intramedullary tumors which share many similar features to ganglioglioma, including T2 hyperintensity, enhancement, tumoral cysts, and cord edema. Poorly defined margins may be more suggestive of astrocytoma, while a central location in the spinal cord, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin staining are often seen with ependymoma. Hemangioblastoma and paraganglioma are less usual intramedullary tumors, but since they are more frequently encountered than ganglioglioma, they should also be included in the differential diagnosis. Treatment Definitive treatment for ganglioglioma requires gross total surgical resection, and a good prognosis is generally expected when this is achieved. However, indistinct tumor margins and the desire to preserve normal spinal cord tissue, motor and sensory function may preclude complete resection of tumor. According to a series by Lang et al., reviewing several patients with resected spinal cord ganglioglioma, the 5- and 10-year survival rates after total resection were 89% and 83%, respectively. In that study, patients with spinal cord ganglioglioma had a 3.5-fold higher relative risk of tumor recurrence compared to patients with supratentorial ganglioglioma. It has been recognized that postoperative results correlate closely with preoperative neurological status as well as the ability to achieve complete resection. With the exception of WHO grade III anaplastic ganglioglioma, radiation therapy is generally regarded to have no role in the treatment of ganglioglioma. In fact, radiation therapy may induce malignant transformation of a recurrent ganglioglioma several years later. Adjuvant chemotherapy is also typically reserved for anaplastic ganglioglioma, but has been used anecdotally in partially resected low grade spinal cord gangliogliomas which show evidence of disease progression.

He is best remembered for his 16-year association with Rangers and for being the first player to receive more than 50 caps for the Scotland national team. Career=Club Born in Grangemouth, Young started his career with junior side Kirkintilloch Rob Roy before moving to Rangers in 1941. Although primarily considered a centre back, he was often played at right back during his 16 years in Govan, to accommodate Willie Woodburn in Rangers' renowned Iron Curtain defence.Hall of Fame  George Young, Rangers FC Young won the League and League Cup in 1946‚Äì47 and the Scottish Cup the following season, before Rangers became the first side to win all three trophies in the same season in 1948‚Äì49. Young himself scored twice from the penalty spot in the 4‚Äì1 Scottish Cup Final victory over Clyde which wrapped up the Treble. Young won further League titles in 1950, 1953, 1956 and 1957, also collecting Scottish Cup winner's medals in 1950 and 1953 to take his senior medal haul to 12. The \\"lucky\\" Champagne cork he always carried earned him the nickname Corky. In total, Young had 458 appearances, scoring 31 goals for the Ibrox club (not including 180 wartime games and 32 goals) when he departed in 1957.Rangers player Young, George, FitbaStats International Young was selected for a string of 34 consecutive senior Scotland matches between 1948 and 1953. His total of 54 caps made him the first member of the Scotland Football Hall of Fame. Young was selected as captain on 48 of those appearances. He was also the first player to appear for Scotland as a substitute, when he replaced Billy Campbell of Morton in a Victory International against Switzerland in May 1946. (the Scottish Football Association have since classified the match as a full international, but it is not recognised by FIFA). Young captained Scotland throughout the 1949‚Äì50 Home International tournament, which FIFA had decreed to be a British qualifying group for the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. The top two teams in the Home Internationals would qualify for Brazil, but the SFA decided Scotland would only travel as British Champions. England's 1‚Äì0 win at Hampden relegated the Scots to second place and they did not travel. Four years later, Scotland again qualified as second-placed country in the Home Internationals, and this time the SFA decided they would travel to Switzerland. Rangers, however, had arranged a tour of North America at the same time and refused to release their players, including Young. In the qualifying tournament for the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden, Scotland were placed in a group with Spain and Switzerland. The group began in May 1957, by which time Young had announced he would retire from playing at the end of that season. He led Scotland to a 4‚Äì2 victory over Spain in the opening game at Hampden on 8 May, and was again captain for their 2‚Äì1 victory over Switzerland, in Basle on 19 May. However, he sustained a thigh strain in that match and did not play in a 3‚Äì1 friendly win over then world champions West Germany in Stuttgart three days later. The return match with Spain in Madrid on 26 May 1957, which Spain won 4-1, was his final game. Young also won 22 caps for the Scottish League XI between 1947 and 1956, the second-highest all-time total for the team. Later life After leaving Rangers, Young had a three-year spell as manager of Third Lanark between 1959 and 1962. Young was then a successful hotelier.

Signs and symptoms 259x259px One of the principle symptoms of GAPO syndrome is growth retardation, caused by slow skeletal formation and results in individuals being below average height. Alopecia, or hair loss, is another key indication of GAPO syndrome. Their hair is typically thinly dispersed, and fragile, which often leads to baldness later in life. Similarly, tooth growth is stunted, with teeth failing to emerge form the gums or otherwise develop normally. Atrophy of the optic nerve occurs in approximately one third of individuals. This degradation leads to inhibited peripheral vision, and increased difficulty distinguishing colours. While not a defining feature, most sufferers of GAPO syndrome have coarse facial features, and abnormal structure of the middle portion of their faces, typically coupled with a large forehead. Individuals with the disease tend to have depressed nose bridges, protruding ears, and abnormally thick lips, though these symptoms are not unique to this disorder. No direct correlation has been found between GAPO syndrome and mental retardation, though cases of individuals having both have been reported. Due to the severity of the phenotype, GAPO syndrome can be diagnosed very early on. Most cases can be diagnosed by 6 months of age, and most symptoms will be apparent by age 2. Genetics GAPO syndrome has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. GAPO syndrome is caused by a deletion in both copies of the ANTXR1 gene, which encodes Anthrax Toxin Receptor 1. This gene is critical for the creation of actin, and its disruption inhibits proper function of the actin network. As a result, individuals with GAPO syndrome have a buildup of extracellular matrix, and degraded cell adhesions. The alteration can occur in the form of nonsense mutations or mutations which alter the splice sites, and result in alternative RNA splicing, leading to synthesis of a different or modified protein. In humans, the ANTXR1 gene is located on Chromosome 2 and has 22 exons. GAPO syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, and requires both parents to pass on the mutant genotype. Since this mutation is so rare, most confirmed cases have a history of ancestral inbreeding. Diagnosis APO syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, alopecia, pseudoanodontia and progressive optic atrophy (GAPO). To date, only 30 cases have been described worldwide. Recently, gene alterations in the ANTXR1 gene have been reported to be causative of this disorder, and an autosomal recessive pattern has been observed. This gene encodes a matrix-interacting protein that works as an adhesion molecule. In this report, we describe 2 homozygous siblings diagnosed with GAPO syndrome carrying a new missense mutation. This mutation produces the substitution of a glutamine in position 137 for a leucine (c.410A>T, p.Q137L). Management There is currently no cure for GAPO syndrome, but some options are available to reduce the symptoms. Nearsightedness, which affects some sufferers of the disease, can be treated by corrective lenses. Unfortunately, optic atrophy as a result of degradation of the optic nerve (common with GAPO syndrome) cannot be corrected. Corticosteroids have been proposed as a treatment for optic nerve atrophy, but their effectiveness is disputed, and no steroid based treatments are currently available. Beyoglu Eye J.

Methods: A 42-year-old man with diagnosis of GAPO syndrome underwent trabeculectomy with application of MMC 0.4 mg/ml for 1 minute. Results: Intraocular pressure was measured between 6 and 8 mmHg during the first month of the surgery. On fundus examination macular choroidal folds, retinal vascular tortuosity and optic nerve swollen was observed. At postoperative 1 month, additional suturing of the bleb was performed however the hypotony continued to occur. Conclusion: Postoperative hypotony should be taken into account in patients with GAPO syndrome due to defective fibrosis process following trabeculectomy. Keywords: GAPO syndrome, trabeculectomy, mitomycin C, hypotony maculopathy History The first incidence of GAPO syndrome was reported by Anderson and Pindborg in 1947. Another case wasn't recorded until 1978 by Fuks et al.

G. Wells, about a man who sleeps for two hundred and three years, waking up in a completely transformed London in which he has become the richest man in the world. The main character awakes to see his dreams realised, and the future revealed to him in all its horrors and malformities. The text published as The Sleeper Awakes in 1910 is a revised version of the novel When the Sleeper Wakes, which was published as a serial, then as a book, in 1899. The 2004 Project Gutenberg title page displays on four lines that suggest a subtitle: _The Sleeper Awakes_ ; A Revised Edition of ‚ÄúWhen the Sleeper Wakes‚Äù; By H. G. Wells; 1899. Library of Congress Catalog uses the subtitle. Publication history When the Sleeper Wakes was originally published as a serial in The Graphic (London) and Harper's Weekly (New York), with illustrations by Henri Lanos.Russell, Alan K. ed. The Collector's Book of Science Fiction by H. G. Wells. Castle Books; New Jersey, 1978. Pg 364. (This source is not reliable if it does report serial publication 1898 to 1903, corrected here April 2020.) Both editions appeared in the first 18 issues of 1899, with Saturday dates 7 January to 5 May. Dissatisfied with its original form, Wells, who was an outspoken socialist and author of prophetic writings, rewrote it in 1910. \\"Like most of my earlier work\\", he wrote in the 1910 edition's preface, \\"it was written under considerable pressure; there are marks of haste not only in the writing of the latter part, but in the very construction of the story.\\"The Sleeper Awakes, by H. G. Wells (HTML format). Project Gutenberg Ebook #12163. 2004; updated 2018. Retrieved 2020-04-22. In the 1910 edition Wells also brought the ‚Äòflying machines‚Äô up to date. The short story \\"A Story of the Days To Come\\" (1897) is a forerunner of the novel, being a tale set within the same future society.  Plot  Graham awakens unexpectedly. Graham, you must come away! Graham's Escape. Graham gets a history lesson from the old man. The Aeropile. Graham addresses himself to the unseen multitudes. : (as revised, 1910) Graham, an Englishman living in London in 1897, takes drugs to cure insomnia and falls into a coma. He wakes up in 2100. He later learns that he has inherited huge wealth and that his money has been put into a trust. Over the years, the trustees, the \\"White Council\\", have used his wealth to establish a vast political and economic world order. When Graham wakes, he is disoriented. The people around him had not expected him to wake up, and are alarmed. Word spreads that the \\"Sleeper\\" has awakened. A mob gathers around the building and demands to see the fabled Sleeper. The people around Graham will not answer his questions. They place Graham under house arrest. Graham learns that he is the legal owner and master of most of the world. Rebels led by Ostrog help Graham to escape. They say that the people need Graham's leadership to rise against the White Council. Unconvinced, but unwilling to remain a prisoner, Graham goes with them. Graham arrives at a massive hall where the workers have gathered to prepare for the revolution. They march against the White Council but are soon attacked by the state police. In the confusion, Graham is separated from the revolutionaries. He meets an old man who tells him the story of the Sleeper - the White Council invested his wealth to buy the industries and political entities of half the world, establishing a plutocracy and sweeping away parliament and the monarchy. The Sleeper is just a figurehead. The old man thinks that the Sleeper is a made-up figure used to brainwash the population. Graham meets Ostrog, who says that the rebels have won and that the people are demanding that the Sleeper should rule. Ostrog retains power while Graham becomes his puppet ruler. Graham gets interested in aeroplanes and learns how to fly. He sees from the air that no-one lives in the country or small towns any more, all agriculture being run like industry; and that there are now only four huge cities in Britain, all powered by huge wind-mills. His carefree life ends when Helen Wotton tells him that, for the lower class, the revolution has changed nothing. Graham questions Ostrog who admits that the lower classes are still dominated and exploited, but he defends the system. It emerges that Ostrog only wanted to take power for himself and has used the revolution and Graham to do so. Ostrog admits that in other cities the workers have continued to rebel even after the fall of the White Council. Ostrog has used a black African police force to get the workers back in line. Graham is furious and demands that Ostrog keep his police out of London. Ostrog agrees. Graham decides to examine this new society for himself. Graham visits London in disguise to see how the workers live. Their lives are ghastly. Unskilled workers toil in factories, paid in food for each day's work, with no job security. They speak a dialect so strong that Graham cannot understand them. Industrial diseases are rife. Workers wear uniforms of different colour according to their trade. The family unit no longer exists and children are cared for in huge institutions. Lives are dominated by \\"babble machines\\" which spread news and \\"pleasure cities\\" where unspecified joys are available. \\"Euthanasy\\" is considered normal. Graham learns that Ostrog has ordered his troops to London. Graham confronts Ostrog, who tries to arrest Graham. The workers rise up again and help Graham to escape. He meets Helen and learns that it was she who told the public about Ostrog's treachery. Graham leads the liberation of London. Ostrog escapes and joins his troops who are flying to London. His men still hold a few airports. The workers find anti-aircraft guns, but they need time to set them up. The revolutionaries have only one aircraft; Graham gives away all of his wealth to the rebels and proceeds to fly the one aircraft against the invaders, bringing some of them down. The revolutionaries get the anti-aircraft guns working and start to shoot down the invaders. Graham attacks Ostrog's aeroplane but fails. Graham's aeroplane crashes. Themes Themes include socialism; the betrayal of revolution; and how an elite can manipulate a population both by oppression and impoverishment on the one hand, and by the use of technology and provision of pleasure on the other. In this respect, the book has elements explored later both in Brave New World by Aldous Huxley and Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell. Reception Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction said of The Sleeper Awakes despite the \\"impossibly timid\\" and outdated science, \\"The worth of the story lies in its human values ... This is 'Young Wells' at his non-Utopian best\\". Proposed film In the late 1960s, George Pal wanted to make a film of the novel. He heard American International Pictures had the rights and offered to buy it from them. They invited him to make the film for them. However, no film resulted.\\"Patience Key to Pal Success\\". Scheuer, Philip K. Los Angeles Times. 8 June 1970: e19. Influence Aspects of the novel's storyline are similar to the plot of the Woody Allen 1973 film Sleeper.James Robert Parish, Michael R. Pitts. The great science fiction pictures: Volume 1, Scarecrow Press, 1977. Pg. 298: \\"Iconoclastic film star /filmmaker Woody Allen turned his comedic genius to a satirical look into the future with a storyline that owes a nod of gratitude to HG Wells' When the Sleeper Awakes.\\" Pulp writer Harry Stephen Keeler took the idea further in a 1914 story called \\"John Jones' Dollar\\", in which a solar system's economy is built around a single silver dollar left to accumulate until the year 2921 to the \\"astounding\\" sum of $6.3 trillion, financing an interplanetary socialist paradise. It is often claimed that Buck Rogers was inspired by this story. The Futurama episode \\"A Fishful of Dollars\\" is loosely based upon Wells's novel. Fry discovers that his bank account has continued to accrue interest over the course of a thousand years.

While Sheng developed in the poorer parts of Nairobi, Engsh evolved among the youth of the richer, more affluent neighbourhoods. Engsh is English based, but mixes Swahili, and other ethnic languages such as Kikuyu and Luo. However, just like Sheng, it is a code, and therefore cannot be understood, for the most part, by standard English speakers. Both Engsh and Sheng originated as secret codes against adults, to enable Nairobi youth to communicate with each other in a language the adults could not understand. The original speakers have since become adults, and parents. Both Engsh and Sheng evolve very fast, and the ability to keep up with the \\"in\\" words of the moment becomes harder the older a person gets, therefore they are still considered languages of the youth. In the past, there was no distinction made between Sheng and Engsh, but the youth speakers of both languages noticed their inability to understand each other properly, as the languages had evolved differently primarily due to the different economic backgrounds. Nevertheless, there are still many similarities between Sheng and Engsh, but Engsh is unique enough to stand as a cant of its own.
