It is standardized under standard EIA-516, and has a rate of 15.6 kbit/s per line of video (with error correction). History NABTS was originally developed as a protocol by the Canadian Department of Communications, with their industry partner Norpak, for the Telidon system. Similar systems had been developed by the BBC in Europe for their Ceefax system, and were later standardized as the World System Teletext (WST, aka CCIR Teletext System B), but differences in European and North American television standards and the greater flexibility of the Telidon standard led to the creation of a new delivery mechanism that was tuned for speed. NABTS was the standard used for both CBS's ExtraVision and NBC's very short-lived NBC Teletext services in the mid-1980s. Due to teletext in general not really catching on in North America, NABTS saw a new use for the datacasting features of WebTV for Windows, under Windows 98, as well as for the now-defunct Intercast system. Canadian company Norpak sold and manufactured encoders and decoders for NABTS until the end of analog broadcasting in North America in the early 2010s; it was acquired by the Ross Video consortium in 2010. NABTS is still used in legacy analog video systems for private closed-circuit data delivery over a television broadcast or video signal. Description In a normal NTSC video signal there are 525 \\"lines\\" of video signal. These are split into two half-images, known as \\"fields\\", sent every 60th of a second. These images merge on-screen, and in- eye, to form a single frame of video updated every 30th of a second. Each line of each field takes 63.5 Œºs to send; 50.3 Œºs of video and 13.2 Œºs amount of \\"dead time\\" on each end used to signal the television that the line is complete, known as the horizontal blanking interval (HBI). When the scanning process reaches the end of the screen it returns to the top during the vertical blanking interval (VBI), which, like the HBI requires some \\"dead time\\" to properly frame the signal on the screen. In this case the dead time is represented by unused lines of the picture signal, normally the top 22 lines of the frame. NABTS encodes data into the video signal as a series of dots at a fixed rate of 5.7272 Mbit/s. Each line of a field has 50.3 Œºs of video area that can be used for transmission, which results in 288 bits per line, or 36 bytes. In NABTS, three bytes are used for hardware synchronization, another three for the packet address, two for sequencing information, leaving 28 for data and redundant forward error correction (FEC) information. In theory, the NABTS codes can be used on any of the 262 lines of the display, allowing up to 262 x 28 = 7,336 bytes of data per frame. Typically, however, the data is instead placed only in the unused lines of the vertical framing area. Lines 1-9 are used for vertical synchronization, line 21 is used for Closed Captioning, and everything after 22 is the television picture. That leaves 10 lines, lines 10 to 20, that are useful for sending data. At 60 fields per second, those 10 lines at 288 bits each encode a total of 172,800 bit/s, although 20% of that is needed for signaling purposes, so rates of 115,200 for end-user data are more typical. Applications requiring less throughput can simply use fewer lines.

The name refers to 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British prime minister. The memo, written by Downing Street foreign policy aide Matthew Rycroft, recorded the head of the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6) as expressing the view following his recent visit to Washington that \\"[George W.] Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\\" It quoted Foreign Secretary Jack Straw as saying it was clear that Bush had \\"made up his mind\\" to take military action but that \\"the case was thin.\\" Straw also noted that Iraq retained \\"WMD capability\\" and that \\"Saddam would continue to play hard-ball with the UN.\\" The military asked about the consequences \\"if Saddam used WMD on day one,\\" posing Kuwait or Israel as potential targets. Attorney- General Lord Goldsmith warned that justifying the invasion on legal grounds would be difficult. However, the meeting took place several months before the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441, the resolution eventually used as the legal basis for the invasion of Iraq. UNR687 also provided a pre-existing basis, as it required Iraq to divest itself of \\"100%\\" of all WMD capacity, which the Memo agreed it had not. A copy of the memo was obtained by British journalist Michael Smith and published in The Sunday Times in May 2005, on the eve of British elections. Smith stated that the memo was equivalent to the Pentagon Papers which exposed American intentions in the Vietnam War and alleged the American media did not report more about it due to a perceived bias towards support for the war. Though its authenticity has never been seriously challenged, the British and American governments have stated that the contents do not accurately reflect their official policy positions at the time.  Introduction  The memo was first published in The Sunday Times on 1 May 2005, during the last days of the UK general election campaign. It went largely unremarked in the U.S. press at first, but was heavily covered in progressive blogs such as those on Daily Kos, because of a remark attributed to Richard Dearlove (then MI6 head) that \\"the intelligence and facts were being fixed [by the U.S.] around the policy\\" of removing Saddam Hussein from power, which was interpreted to show that US intelligence on Iraq prior to the war was deliberately falsified, rather than simply mistaken. As this issue began to be covered by American media (Los Angeles Times on 12 May 2005, Washington Post on 13 May 2005, two other main allegations stemming from the memo arose: that the UN weapons inspection process was manipulated to provide a legal pretext for the war, and that pre-war air strikes were deliberately ramped up in order to soften Iraqi infrastructure in preparation for war, prior to the October U.S. Senate vote permitting the invasion. Some elements of the U.S. media have portrayed the document as faked or fraudulent, and Dana Perino referred in her daily White House press briefing on 4 December 2008 to the fact that the Bush administration has \\"debunked\\" the document previously. The British have tacitly validated its authenticity (as when Tony Blair replied to a press conference question by saying \\"that memorandum was written before we then went to the United Nations.\\") A group of 131 members of Congress led by John Conyers, repeatedly requested that President George W. Bush respond to the contents of the document. A resolution of inquiry was filed by Representative Barbara Lee, which would request that the President and the State Department turn over all relevant information with regard to US policy towards Iraq. The resolution had 70 co-sponsors.  Outline  Addressees of the memo Copies of the minutes were sent to: *Secretary of State for Defence Geoff Hoon, *Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Jack Straw, *Attorney General of England and Wales Lord Goldsmith, *Cabinet Secretary Sir Richard Wilson, *Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee John Scarlett, *Director of the Government Communications Headquarters Francis Richards, *Chief of the Defence Staff Sir Michael Boyce, *Head of the Secret Intelligence Service Richard Dearlove, *Prime Minister's Chief of Staff Jonathan Powell, *Downing Street Director of Government Relations Sally Morgan, and *Downing Street Director of Communications and Strategy Alastair Campbell. The minutes were meant to be kept confidential and were headed \\"This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents.\\" It deals with the lead-up to the 2003 Iraq War, and comes at a point at which it becomes clear to those attending, that US President George W. Bush intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force. The minutes run through the military options and then consider the political strategy in which an appeal for support from the international community and from domestic opinion would be most likely to be positively received. It suggests that an ultimatum for Saddam to allow back United Nations weapons inspectors be issued, and that this would help to make the use of force legal. Tony Blair is quoted as saying that the British public would support regime change in the right political context. The most controversial paragraph is a report of a recent visit to Washington by head of the Secret Intelligence Service Sir Richard Dearlove (known in official terminology as 'C'): The British analysis of US policy is also stated elsewhere in the minutes: The main sections covering the ultimatum are: The minutes also outlines potential risks of an invasion of Iraq:  Reaction  = Proponents of an inquiry = In the United States, proponents of a formal congressional inquiry say that the minutes, along with testimonies from credible witnesses, shed sufficient doubt on the actions of the Bush Administration to warrant a formal inquiry. In particular, they say that the minutes indicate that the Administration was determined to go to war with Iraq prior to considerations of legality, and with full knowledge that, at best, \\"the case was slim.\\" And furthermore that they selected and exaggerated intelligence so as to confirm their policy and developed a plan to manipulate public opinion. Also, proponents say that the contents (such as \\"Military action was now seen as inevitable.\\") and the date of the memo, 23 July 2002, contradicts the official White House position that President Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after Secretary of State Colin L. Powell presented the administration's case to the United Nations Security Council, in a speech on 5 February 2003. They also say that the minutes are dated at a time when Bush stated that \\"we haven't made any decisions on Iraq, but all options are on the table.\\" Another paragraph has been taken to show that Geoff Hoon believed the timing of the war was intended to influence American elections: It has been said that some of those present at the meeting believed that Iraq might possess weapons of mass destruction (WMD) \\"capacity\\". However, the minutes explicitly state that the capability was less than that of Libya, Iran, and North Korea, and that Saddam was not threatening his neighbours. = U.S. Congress = On 5 May 2005, Democratic Congressman John Conyers sent a letter to President Bush signed by 89 of his colleagues demanding an explanation of the \\"troubling revelations\\" in the memo. No specific White House response to the letter was ever made publicly. In response to the Bush Administration's refusal to answer the congressional delegation's questions, Conyers et al. considered sending a fact-finding mission to the UK. Conyers initially requested 100,000 signatures from citizens (a petition) to request that President Bush answer the questions in his letter. The letter began accumulating between 20,000 and 25,000 signatures a day, boosted by progressive political action group MoveOn.org, which joined the campaign on 9 June. By 13 June 2005, the letter had received over 540,000 signatures from citizens, and more congressmen had signed on, bringing the total to 94 ‚Äì three days later, over 100 congressmen had signed the letter, including then-Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. On 16 June 2005, Conyers presided over an unofficial hearing or forum on the Downing Street memo in a basement room in the Capitol where notable opponents of the Iraq War Joseph C. Wilson, Ray McGovern and Cindy Sheehan, among others, testified. = Internet = Smintheus at Daily Kos, and MYDD first addressed the memo on the night of 30 April 2005. By the next morning the document was elevated to a major story on the Daily Kos, where Democratic Congressman John Conyers learned of its existence. A website, www.downingstreetmemo.com, was created on 13 May, \\"to fill a void left by the American mainstream media,\\" and continues with its primary aim \\"to provide a resource for anyone who wants to understand the meaning and context of these documents as they relate to the Bush administration's case for war.\\" On 30 May 2005, in a \\"blogswarm\\" fueled by the memo, hundreds of blogs joined together to form the Big Brass Alliance in support of After Downing Street. On 1 June 2005 a targeted media campaign called 'Awaken the Mainstream Media' began jointly at Daily Kos and downingstreetmemo.com. Every day it listed new contact information for three news outlets, so that readers could contact them to urge them to provide better coverage of the issues around the Downing Street memo and other released documents. = Pundits = On 18 May, conservative pundit and former Reagan Administration advisor Paul Craig Roberts wrote an article calling for Bush's impeachment for lying to Congress about the case for war. On 31 May, liberal consumer advocate and former presidential hopeful Ralph Nader wrote an article on ZNet calling for Bush and Cheney's impeachment under Article II, Section 4 of the United States Constitution. Also on that day, he and Kevin Zeese authored an op-ed for the Boston Globe to support the call for impeachment against Bush, citing the memo as part of the evidence that the possibility of deliberate deception by the administration should be investigated. On 30 January 2006, an article entitled The Impeachment of George W. Bush, written by Elizabeth Holtzman (Rep. NY-D 1973‚Äì1981, member of the House Judiciary Committee that held impeachment hearings of President Richard Nixon) was published by the left-wing periodical The Nation. The article makes specific references to the Downing Street memo. =Political groups= A coalition of American groups known as After Downing Street, co- founded by a group of longtime progressive and/or Democratic Party activists,afterdowningstreet.org, Co-Founders. Retrieved 28 March 2007 called on Congress to file a Resolution of Inquiry, the first necessary legal step to determine whether President Bush had committed impeachable offences. The formal Resolution of Inquiry request was written by Boston constitutional attorney John C. Bonifaz. The request states the constitutional grounds for impeachment: Democrats.com raised one thousand dollars, offered as a reward to anyone who could get George Bush to answer the following question \\"Yes\\" or \\"No: In addition a number of lesser prizes were offered for lesser responses, down to a $100 for posing the question clearly to Bush.  News coverage  The Downing Street Minutes was a major story in the British press during the last few days of the 2005 general election campaign and was also covered in other countries. The story initially had limited coverage in the US but later recently received greater attention in the American press. The organisation Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting has been among those that have criticised the US print media, saying they \\"continue to downplay [the] story.\\" According to Media Matters for America, there were some early mentions in The New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, the New York Sun, and the Washington Post, though coverage was slight (the Post's first article appeared in the \\"Style\\" section) and primarily aimed at the impact it would have on the British elections, rather than how it affected the Bush administration. The Knight- Ridder news service produced some reportage at the time, but independent articles were limited. The Los Angeles Times and Star Tribune put local reporters on the story, and produced early articles on 12 May and 13 May, respectively. At the Star Tribune, initial interest had been piqued after a reader e-mailed information he had seen on the Internet to the paper's ombudsman, who forwarded it to others in the news department. Being quite a distance from London, editors first waited for articles to come across on wire services. Undoubtedly, many other newspapers across the country reacted similarly. After a few days of no news, however, a local reporter was assigned. The article was initially scheduled to run on 11 May, but was pushed back so that it could have greater prominence on a slower news day later in the week. Since that time, much of the coverage about the memo has discussed the lack of coverage. One of the first reports include that topic was a 17 May article in the Christian Science Monitor. The report was one of the most extensive for a nationwide publication up until that time. On 20 May 2005, Daniel Okrent, the Public Editor at the time for The New York Times, publicly assessed the coverage of the minutes in the paper in a forum on the NYT's website. He also stated that, due to continuing reader interest, the paper intends to give fuller coverage to the memo. Although Okrent stepped down at the end of May (the routine end of his term), on NewsHour on 8 June he suggested some possible reasons that the US media had been so slow to cover what he considered a very important story. He said it may have been assigned to 'foreign news' correspondents and wasn't seen as a Bush story, or it may be the US media was still working on researching it (although he then admitted he had no reason to believe that). Also on 8 June, USA Today printed an article by their senior assignment editor for foreign news, Jim Cox, saying with respect to the memo, \\"We could not obtain the memo or a copy of it from a reliable source. ‚Ä¶ There was no explicit confirmation of its authenticity from (Blair's office). And it was disclosed four days before the British elections, raising concerns about the timing.\\" The Star Tribune revisited the Downing Street Minutes as part of the evidence in a Memorial Day editorial. It stated explicitly, The New York Times reported on the memos on 27 March 2006. MSNBC reported on the memos on 28 March 2006. MSNBC has an article and a video clip from NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams. The Colombian newspaper El Tiempo implicated the Prime Minister's role in the Iraq War on 9 May 2007 ‚Äì and the Downing Street memo specifically ‚Äì as \\"the principal reason for the UK's disillusionment with Tony Blair.\\"El Tiempo 9 May 2007 The Chilean newspaper La Segunda on 11 May 2007 called the Downing Street memo \\"one of the best-kept secrets in Tony Blair's ten years as prime minister.\\" One of the first articles on the memo to appear in the US media quoted \\"a former senior US official\\", who, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the memo's account \\"an absolutely accurate description of what transpired\\" during the senior British intelligence officer's visit to Washington. UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed, also commenting that \\"that memorandum was written before we went to the United Nations\\". *White House spokesman Scott McClellan, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw did not confirm or deny the accuracy of the memo when questioned about it. *George W. Bush has not responded to questions from Congress regarding the memo's accuracy. *When asked about the contents of the memo by Plaid Cymru MP Adam Price in the House of Commons on 29 June 2005, Blair again refrained from disputing the document's authenticity, saying only \\"[‚Ä¶]that memo and other documents of the time were covered by the Butler review. In addition, that was before we went to the United Nations and secured the second resolution, 1441, which had unanimous support.\\" *According to CNN, currently classified documents which were dated at the same month as the Downing Street memo, March 2002, were uncovered in Iraq, and contained evidence that Russian intelligence notified Iraq about the \\"determination of the United States and Britain to launch military action.\\" = US President George W. Bush = On 7 June 2005, at a joint George W. Bush-Tony Blair press briefing in the White House, Reuters correspondent Steve Holland asked, \\"On Iraq, the so-called Downing Street memo from July 2002 says intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy of removing Saddam through military action. Is this an accurate reflection of what happened? Could both of you respond?\\" President Bush did not address the issue of the intelligence and facts being \\"fixed\\" around a decision to go to war, but he did deny that he had, at the time of the memo, already decided to use military force against Saddam Hussein, saying \\"There's nothing farther from the truth.\\" Bush also questioned the motives of whoever leaked the memo during the British election, saying \\"Well, I‚Äîyou know, I read kind of the characterisations of the memo, particularly when they dropped it out in the middle of his race. ‚Ä¶ I'm not sure who 'they dropped it out' is, but‚ÄîI'm not suggesting that you all dropped it out there.\\" = UK Prime Minister Tony Blair = When the document was published, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed. Blair's response to Steve Holland at the joint news conference with Bush was \\"No, the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all\\". He also reiterated that he and Bush had continued to try to find a way to avert war, \\"As it happened, we weren't able to do that because ‚Äì as I think was very clear ‚Äì there was no way that Saddam Hussein was ever going to change the way that he worked, or the way that he acted,\\". He said the same thing in a 7 June 2005 interview with Gwen Ifill on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer. = White House spokesman Scott McClellan = On 16 May, presidential spokesman Scott McClellan said that the memo's statement that intelligence was \\"being fixed\\" to support a decision to invade Iraq was \\"flat out wrong\\". However, McClellan admitted that he has not read the memo, but has only received reports of what it contains. On 17 May, McClellan told reporters that the White House saw \\"no need\\" to respond to the letter from Congress. On 23 May, when BTC News reporter Eric Brewer asked him about his 16 May statement, McClellan said: The following day, a popular political blog, ThinkProgress, posted a response titled \\"Take the McClellan Challenge\\", comparing what the intelligence was with how it was used by the administration. = US Secretary of State Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Straw = On 1 May 2005, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were questioned on the memo, although neither was able to give a detailed answer. Straw stated that he had not expected the question to come up. Veracity of the memo Following the advice of company lawyers, Michael Smith, the journalist who first reported on the Downing Street Memo, has said that he protected the identity of his source by reproducing all documents and returning the 'originals' back to the source. In some cases, a document was retyped from a photocopy, and the photocopy destroyed.Interview with Michael Smith DowningStreetMemo.com 27 June 2005 This has led some to question the document's authenticity, but no official source has questioned it, and it has been unofficially confirmed to various news organisations, including the Washington Post, NBC, The Sunday Times, and the LA Times. Several other documents obtained by Smith, and treated similarly (see below), were confirmed as genuine by the UK Foreign Office.  Additional documents  Previous to the appearance of the Downing Street Memo, six other British (Blair) Cabinet papers originating around March 2002 were obtained by Michael Smith and used in two Daily Telegraph stories published on 18 September 2004. The documents describe issues relating to the meetings held between Bush and Blair at Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch in April 2002. They are: #Iraq: Options Paper, prepared by the Overseas & Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, dated 8 March 2002, describing options available for pursuing regime change in Iraq # Iraq: Legal Background, prepared by the Foreign & Commonwealth Office Legal Department, dated 8 March 2002 # a report from David Manning to Tony Blair on his meeting with Condoleezza Rice, dated 14 March 2002 # a report from Christopher Meyer to David Manning on his meeting with Paul Wolfowitz, dated 18 March 2002 # a memo from Peter Ricketts, Political Director, Foreign & Commonwealth Office, to the Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, dated 22 March 2002, with background and opinion for Straw's advice to Tony Blair ahead of his meeting with George Bush in April # a memo from Jack Straw to Tony Blair, 25 March 2002 containing advice ahead of Blair's meeting with George Bush in April. On receipt of the documents, in September 2004, acting on the advice of lawyers, Smith says he photocopied them and returned the originals to his source, then, after the Telegraph's legal desk secretary typed transcripts on an \\"old fashioned typewriter\\", the Telegraph destroyed their copies of the originals, in order to frustrate any future police investigation of the leaks. The documents were widely quoted in the British press immediately following the Telegraph's story, for example in The Guardian and The Sunday Herald. On 5 October 2004, facsimiles of these documents appeared online, provided by Professor Michael Lewis of Cambridge University, who had also housed the file at Iraq expert Glen Rangwala's Middle East Reference website. The file derives ultimately from the typed transcript of the documents made by Smith and the Telegraph. Interest in these documents was revived around 8 June 2005, following their appearance in a discussion thread at Democratic Underground and subsequently they began to be quoted in US media, after Rawstory and NBC verified their authenticity with Smith and British government sources. The Los Angeles Times published an article on 15 June 2005, describing several of the \\"new\\" documents; the article says that \\"Michael Smith, the defense writer for The Sunday Times who revealed the Downing Street minutes in a story 1 May, provided a full text of the six new documents to the Los Angeles Times.\\" The six documents are available in PDF form from the Think Progress web site. A further document, a 21 July 2002, cabinet office paper titled \\"Conditions for Military Action\\", which is a briefing paper for the meeting of which the Downing Street Memo is the minutes, was published (with the last page missing) by The Sunday Times on 12 June 2005. Another document was the Rycroft email, showing the author of the Downing Street Memo actually believed that Saddam should be removed because of a threat by Iraq getting WMDs into the hands of terrorists. The 18 September 2004 Daily Telegraph article contains the only known reproductions of the original memos (scanned from a photocopy). That article is called \\"Failure is not an option, but it doesn't mean they will avoid it\\". On Thursday, 16 June 2005 Reuters mislabelled a photograph of what it claimed was \\"a copy of the Downing Street Memo\\". It turned out to actually be a picture of a document found in a 28 April 2005 Guardian Unlimited story. (At this link, view this PDF: 07.03.03: Attorney general's full advice on Iraq war (pdf)) This PDF detailed Lord Goldsmith's confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war and does not match the text of any of the alleged Downing Street Memos. It's an entirely different document that describes legal authorisation for the invasion of Iraq under standing UN resolutions. Criticism of the memo Journalists such as Fred Kaplan point out that the later section of the memo that discusses potential consequences of an invasion, including Saddam's use of WMD against Kuwait or Israel, directly contradicts interpretations of the memo as a \\"smoking gun\\" about WMD fabrication. As mentioned above, shortly after the appearance of the memo, Tony Blair was asked: Blair responded: It is not clear whether this is a criticism of the assessment of his own head of foreign intelligence (Dearlove) or a criticism of a particular interpretation of Dearlove's phrase \\"fixed around\\". = \\"Fixed\\" = The interpretation of the sentence: \\"But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.\\" has caused debate. Robin Niblett, a member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, has said it would be easy for Americans to misunderstand the reference to intelligence being \\"fixed around\\" Iraq policy. \\" 'Fixed around' in British English means 'bolted on' rather than altered to fit the policy,\\" he says. This view was seconded by Christopher Hitchens and Fred Kaplan. Others have suggested various British English usages of the phrase \\"were being fixed\\" (for example as a colloquialism meaning \\"to agree upon,\\") which are distinct from the usage (both American and British) derived from criminal argot, meaning \\"fraudulently altered or changed.\\" The author of the memo, Matthew Rycroft, employed the former usage in an e-mail when talking about an appointment, This is now fixed for 0800. Some detractors from the memo have appeared to make the argument or give the impression that the \\"fraudulently altered\\" sense of \\"fix\\" is uniquely American and does not exist in British English, but this is false. Other commentaters have dismissed this, saying that context makes it clear that \\"being fixed around\\" used \\"fix\\" in the sense of \\"fraudulently arrange the result\\", a common British usage (sense 12(b) of \\"fix\\" in the printed Concise Oxford English Dictionary, given as sense 7, \\"deviously influence the outcome of\\" in the Compact OED online version.) The argument has also been made that this view is supported by negative qualification implied by the presence of the word \\"But\\" at the start of the relevant sentence: \\"But the intelligence and facts were being (innocently) agreed upon around the policy\\" is, it is said, an implausible reading because there is nothing negative, per se, about agreement, whereas \\"But the intelligence and facts were being fraudulently arranged ...\\", it is argued, appears to make perfect sense, because it fulfills the negative expectation set up by the word \\"but\\". Fred Kaplan noted that \\"Either way‚Äî'fixed' or 'fixed around'‚ÄîBush and his aides had decided to let policy shape intelligence, not the other way around; they were explicitly politicising intelligence.\\" When asked about the memo's implication that Iraq intelligence was being \\"fixed\\", White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, \\"The suggestion is just flat-out wrong.\\" But McClellan would later admit that intelligence was suited to fit the policy in a tell-all book.

Founded in 1852, it is a member of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education (PASSHE). The university offers bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees. It is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. The main campus consists of about 38 buildings situated on . Another facility is located near the main campus and houses the school's soccer facility. An additional recreation complex, George H. Roadman University Park, is located from campus and includes a football stadium, various sports facilities, and picnic facilities. The University's student association also owns 98 acres at the SAI Farm, located near Roadman Park, as well as 25-acre Vulcan Village Student Apartments. Cal U has a large virtual school. History California University of Pennsylvania traces its roots back to 1852, when the community of California spent tax money and donations to create an academy for kindergarten through college-level courses. In 1864, it purchased and moved to what is now the center of its present location, and a year later the school received a charter to be a normal school. In 1874, the institution was renamed SouthWestern Normal School and in 1914 Pennsylvania bought the school, renaming it the California State Normal School and converted it into a two-year institute for training of elementary school teachers. In 1928 the school restored a full four-year curriculum and was renamed the California State Teachers College. The programs offered were expanded over time and broadened beyond teacher training, and by 1959 the school's name was condensed to California State College. In 1962, the school added a graduate program. The school became a part of the State System of Higher Education on July 1, 1983. At the same time, it was granted university status under its current name, California University of Pennsylvania. Facilities Eberly Science & Technology Center California University has recently received state and private grants to rebuild the campus. Since 2000, six new residence halls have been completed, each with private bathrooms. A short drive or bus ride from campus, Cal U has apartment-like housing at the Vulcan Village complex. The Elmo Natali Student Center, operated by the Student Association, Inc., is the main hub of student activities on campus. The student center hosts the student services offices, commuter center, theater, performance center, campus bookstore, the school's TV and Radio stations, CUTV and WCAL, as well as four distinctive dining areas. The Union was recently renovated as of the summer of 2015, planning to add new dining and study areas for Cal U students. The Eberly Science and Technology Center opened in 1999, while the new Duda Hall (which replaced the original Duda World Cultures Building) opened in 2007. Steele Auditorium underwent a major renovation and expansion project, reopening in the Fall of 2007. The Heron Hall recreation facility underwent significant renovation and expansion through the Fall and Spring semesters of 2008, opening to student and faculty use on Homecoming Day 2009. The new facility features an elevated running track, cardio equipment, free weight equipment, weight machines, two racquetball courts, a dance studio, two gymnasiums, and a swimming pool. By far the largest project at the University was the building of the new Convocation Center. Opened in 2011, the building covers , while seating over 6,000. The building is the largest indoor venue between Morgantown, West Virginia and Pittsburgh. The building supplements as the University's current sporting venue, Hamer Hall. As part of the Outreach Mission, the university has become a participant of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service (SITES) program, a part of the Smithsonian that allows exhibits to travel to various locations across the United States. Outreach programs this provides unique educational experiences and opportunities for personal enrichment and professional development for area students and residents of all ages. California University Television California University Television (CUTV) is a student television station serving California University of Pennsylvania and over 100,000 households in the Monongahela River Valley. CUTV, like its sister campus radio station WCAL-FM, is owned and operated by the Student Association (SAI) and broadcasts from the Media Suite of the Natali Student Center on Cal U's main campus. In addition to Final Cut Pro X digital editing suites, CUTV has a three-camera HD news, sports, and interview set. The station also has HD SD Card Field Cameras, a master control room and a mobile television truck, which is used by the station for production of Cal U Vulcan sporting events as well as High School Football Games of the week. CUTV produces programming throughout the school year. NewsCenter, CUTV's flagship program, broadcasts live news from the University and around the Mon Valley, as well as sports, entertainment and weather. NewsCenter airs live on Thursdays at 5:00 PM. CUTV Sports covers California University's sports teams, including Vulcan football, women's volleyball and men's and women's soccer in the fall, both men's and women's basketball and the Homecoming Hockey game in the winter, as well as baseball in the spring.

They have also won awards for Best Play By Play, and Best Sports Program (High School Round-Up) at the Intercollegiate Broadcasting Systems Conference in NYC. Athletics Cal U's nickname is the Vulcans, and its athletic teams compete at the NCAA Division II in the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference (PSAC). The school has been one of the more successful in the PSAC. The university has won a total of five national championships. In 2004, sophomore guard Megan Storck knocked down a deep three-pointer in the final minute of play, breaking open a tie ballgame to give Cal U its first women's national basketball title. Women's basketball won a second title by defeating California Baptist 86-69 in 2015, helped by a 21-0 first half run. Cal U's softball program won back to back championships in 1997 and 1998, including a 50‚Äì1 campaign during its first championship run. In 2008, the men's club ice hockey team captured an ACHA Division III national championship over San Diego State in a 7‚Äì3 finale capping off a 30‚Äì1 season record. The Vulcans have also had success in women's volleyball, men's and women's soccer, men's basketball, women's tennis and baseball, each advancing to the NCAA Tournament this decade. The men's basketball team has had a pair of runs to the NCAA Division II Final Four (1992 and 1996), as well as advancing to the Elite Eight in 2008. The women's basketball team has made two consecutive trips to the Elite Eight (2008 and 2009). The volleyball program went to the Final Four in 2000 and the Sweet 16 twice (2004 and 2006), as well as the Elite Eight twice (2007 and 2008). The women's tennis team advanced to the Division II Elite Eight in 2006. The men's soccer team won the first PSAC Championship in program history in 2008. The women's soccer team has advanced to its first ever NCAA tournament in 2009, going on to win the Atlantic Regional title. The Cal U football team has won five consecutive PSAC championships, beginning in 2005. The Vulcans also won in 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. The Vulcans football team ended the 2007 season ranked #4 in the NCAA Division II, won the PSAC Championship, and captured their first NCAA Regional title, Defeating Shepherd University by a score of 58-38. With that victory, Cal U advanced to the National Semifinal game, which was played at Hepner-Bailey Field at Adamson Stadium. The Vulcans lost in their first attempt to advance to a national championship, falling to Valdosta State (Georgia), 28-24. In 2008, the Vulcans again advanced won the Regional title, this time traveling to Bloomsburg and defeating the Huskies 27-24. Once again the Vulcans were rewarded with hosting rights for the National Semifinal. However, the Vulcans were defeated by Minnesota Duluth, thus ending their second try at a national title. The 2009 season saw the California Vulcans start with an 0-2 record. However, Cal U rebounded and qualified for the Division II Championships once again. California won their third consecutive Super Region 1 title, defeating West Liberty. However, the Vulcans had to go on the road for the first time for their next National Semifinal matchup. The Vulcans traveled to Maryville, Missouri to take on Division II power Northwest Missouri State. The Vulcans were defeated by the Bearcats by a score of 56‚Äì31. Prior to the start of the 2009 season, Cal U purchased a wave cam generally used on Monday Night Football and by purchasing this new technology Cal U was the only college team in the country to have one. Vulcan athletes also demonstrate academic accomplishments. More than half of Cal U's 18 varsity athletic teams posted grade point averages above 3.00 during the 2006‚Äì07 academic year, and 74% of the nearly 400 student-athletes were named to the Athletic Director's Academic Honor Roll (3.00 GPA or better), including 36 with perfect 4.00 GPAs during at least one semester. California University of Pennsylvania also manages several athletic facilities. Hamer Hall is the home of Cal U's indoor teams, including volleyball, basketball and swimming, as well as excellent athletic training and weight-training facilities, locker rooms, athletic offices and classrooms. The football and track & field teams call Hepner-Bailey Field at Adamson Stadium, located a mile south of the main campus, home. The cross country, softball, soccer and tennis teams compete in the adjacent Roadman Park complex. CONSOL Energy Park in Washington, Pennsylvania, hosts Cal U's home baseball games annually. The golf teams, added to the lineup of varsity sports in 2005, play at nearby Cedarbrook Golf Course. Bill Brown, who recently retired, was the head basketball coach for 20 years, with an overall record of 365-207. Jess Strom is the women's head basketball coach, with an overall record of 165-46, including a 2015 NCAA National Championship. Academics Cal U has a wide range of academic programs.

The Pummerer rearrangement The stoichiometry of the reaction is: :RS(O)CHR'2 \\\\+ Ac2O ‚Üí RSC(OAc)R'2 \\\\+ AcOH Synthetic implementation Aside from acetic anhydride, trifluoroacetic anhydride and trifluoromethanesulfonic anhydride have been employed as activators. Common nucleophiles besides acetates are arenes, alkenes, amides, and phenols. The usage of Œ±-acyl sulfoxides and Lewis acids, such as TiCl4 and SnCl4, allow the reaction to proceed at lower temperatures (0 ¬∞C). Thionyl chloride can be used in place of acetic anhydride to trigger the elimination for forming the electrophilic intermediate and supplying chloride as the nucleophile to give an Œ±-chloro-thioether: Example of the Pummerer rearrangement using thionyl chloride Other anhydrides and acyl halides can give similar products. Inorganic acids can also give this reaction. This product can be converted to aldehyde or ketone by hydrolysis. Mechanism The mechanism of the Pummerer rearrangement begins with the acylation of the sulfoxide (resonance structures 1 and 2) by acetic anhydride to give 3, with acetate as byproduct. The acetate then acts as a catalyst to induce an elimination reaction to produce the cationic-thial structure 4, with acetic acid as byproduct. Finally, acetate attacks the thial to give the final product 5. The mechanism of the Pummerer rearrangement The activated thial electrophile can be trapped by various intramolecular and intermolecular nucleophiles to form carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds and carbon‚Äìheteroatom bonds. The intermediate is so electrophilic that even neutral nucleophiles can be used, including aromatic rings with electron donating groups such as 1,3-benzodioxole: Example of the Pummerer rearrangement using veratrole It is possible to perform the rearrangement using selenium in the place of sulfur. = Pummerer fragmentation = When a substituent on the Œ± position can form a stable carbocation, this group rather than the Œ±-hydrogen atom will eliminate in the intermediate step. This variation is called a Pummerer fragmentation. This reaction type is demonstrated below with a set of sulfoxides and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA): Pummerer fragmentation The organic group \\"R2\\" shown in the diagram above on the bottom right is the methyl violet carbocation, whose pKR+ of 9.4 is not sufficient to out-compete loss of H+ and therefore a classical Pummerer rearrangement occurs.

It is part of the Restoration Movement and has historically been concerned with the restoration of New Testament patterns of Christianity as a means of encouraging unity among Christians.Graeme Chapman, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism (1979), 21, https://webfiles.acu.edu/departments/Library/HR/restmov_nov11/www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/gchapman/ONELORD.HTM The Churches of Christ in Australia are made up of State Conferences which are an association of independent churches who choose to relate at a state and federal level. Within this conference structure, individual churches are largely autonomous and operate on a congregational and democratic form of government. Leadership varies in local churches and where there are ministers or pastor they may or may not be formally ordained. Lay people usually play an important part in the worship, mission, governance and management of the church.Gerald Rose, \\"Churches of Christ in Australia\\", in Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia, edited by James Jupp (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 295-299. Key features of the church's worship are the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper presided over by a lay person and believer's baptism. This Christian movement claims to \\"concentrate on the essential aspects of the Christian faith, allowing for a diversity of understanding with non-essentials.\\" It is active in community services and supporting Christian unity, although this emphasis was stronger historically. Churches of Christ is one of the smaller Christian groups by affiliation in Australia. The 2001 Census showed 61,335 identifying, falling to 49,687 in the 2011 Census, which represents 0.2% of the population. This is compared with 61.1% of Australians who indicated religious affiliation with any Christian denomination. The National Church Life Survey 2001 showed that Churches of Christ had the highest attendance-to-affiliation percentage. This survey showed a regular estimated attendance of 45,100 (74%). Average weekly attendance figures in 2013 were 38 500, although a larger number of people would be expected to have a connection to a Church of Christ. Worship and devotion Key features are the weekly celebration of the Lord's Supper presided over by a lay person and a commitment to believer's baptism. Ministry and mission The church is active in community services and the ecumenical movement. National cooperative ministries include Global Mission Partners (formerly the Australian Churches of Christ Overseas Mission Board), Stirling Theological College, Indigenous Ministries Australia, the Defence Force Chaplains Committee, and Youth Vision Australia. Theology and values The denomination claims to \\"concentrate on the essential aspects of the Christian faith, allowing for a diversity of understanding with non-essentials.\\" Theological education and formation occurs at the: *Stirling Theological College, located in Mulgrave in south-east Melbourne, is the movement's national theological college.

Douglas A. Foster, Paul M. Blowers, Anthony L. Dunnavant and D. Newell Williams (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2004), 47. Congregations in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales were established at the initiative of individuals who travelled to these colonies to pursue employment opportunities. Elsewhere in Australia Churches of Christ congregations were established as missionary initiatives: Tasmania in the 1870s, Queensland in 1882 and Western Australia in 1891.Gerald Rose, \\"Churches of Christ in Australia\\", in Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia, edited by James Jupp (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 295. In the beginning Churches of Christ in Australia (known as 'Disciples' until the 1860s) relied heavily on lay ministers who tended to preach in a dry and reasoning manner, maintained congregational autonomy under the governance of elders, strictly observed what they believed were New Testament patterns (especially weekly Lord's Supper and baptism by immersion), and took a 'common sense' approach to reading the Bible.Kerrie Handasyde, 'Transforming History: The Origins of the Stone-Campbell Movement in Victoria, Australia, Stone- Campbell Journal Vol. 17, no. 1 (2014) However, practices of ministry, structures of governance, worship and theology have all changed over time and this has raised issues of identity for the Churches of Christ in Australia.Gerald Rose, \\"Churches of Christ in Australia\\", in Encyclopedia of Religion in Australia, edited by James Jupp (Melbourne: Cambridge University Press, 2009), 296. The Churches of Christ in Australia are more similar to the Christian Church in the United States (most Churches of Christ in the United States sing a capella, whereas most Churches of Christ in Australia use musical instruments, as does the Christian Church in the United States). =Victoria= Churches of Christ in Victoria began with the arrival of the Ingram and Picton families from England who established regular meetings in Prahran and officially constituted a congregation in 1855.Graeme Chapman, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism (1979) https://webfiles.acu.edu/departments/Library/HR/restmov_nov11/www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/gchapman/ONELORD.HTM By 1861 there were 12 congregations with a total of 230 members. Seeking to increase the membership, the congregations combined to support their first full-time evangelist, Isaac Mermelstein, a converted Jew from Kiev. He travelled to Chiltern on the north-east Victorian goldfields in 1861 where he officiated at a number of baptisms.Kerrie Handasyde, \\"Pioneering Leadership: Historical Myth-Making, Absence and Identity in the Churches of Christ in Victoria\\", Journal of Religious History Vol.41, no.2 (2017), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9809.12367 However, Mermelstein faded from view in the history of Churches of Christ as he disagreed with the leadership over the nature of baptism. Baptism by immersion on confession of faith was considered essential for salvation, but Mermelstein appears to have also been convinced of the validity of Holy Spirit baptism - something which the then deeply rationalist Churches of Christ could not abide.Kerrie Handasyde, \\"Pentecost Past or Present: Responses to Charismatic Phenomena in Churches of Christ in Australia\\", Pneuma Vol. 41, no. 3-4 (2019), https://doi.org/10.1163/15700747-04103004 The church experienced some growth with the evangelism of T.H. Milner, visiting from Scotland in 1862, and then significant growth with the preaching of Henry S. Earl who arrived from the USA in 1864 as the first of a number of American preachers who influenced Churches of Christ in Victoria.Kerrie Handasyde, \\"Pioneering Leadership: Historical Myth-Making, Absence and Identity in the Churches of Christ in Victoria\\", Journal of Religious History Vol.41, no.2 (2017), https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9809.12367 Despite the presence of some American preachers, the denomination understood itself to be essentially British and this was reflected in its correspondence with British journals such as the British Millennial Harbinger.James Wallis, ed., British Millennial Harbinger (1861), https://books.google.ht/books?id=cQ4EAAAAQAAJ&printsec;=frontcover&hl;=fr&source;=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad;=0#v=onepage&q;&f;=false In the 1880s Antoinette Thurgood established a ministry for and by women in Victoria.Kerrie Handasyde, Privilege to Serve: A History of Christian Women's Fellowship in Victorian and Tasmanian Churches of Christ, https://www.academia.edu/12970794/Privilege_to_Serve_A_History_of_Christian_Womens_Fellowship_in_Victorian_and_Tasmanian_Churches_of_Christ Initially called the Sisters' Conference, it was later known as Christian Women's Fellowship.Kerrie Handasyde, With My Sister Beside Me: History of Women's Ministries, Churches of Christ in Australia, https://www.academia.edu/12970733/With_My_Sister_Beside_Me_History_of_Womens_Ministries_Churches_of_Christ_in_Australia The first woman to be appointed to pastoral ministry (Hawthorne Church of Christ, Qld.) was Violet Callanan in 1931 who had recently completed a certificate in mission studies at the College of the Bible in Glen Iris, Melbourne, and the first woman to be ordained was Alice Barton Saunders in 1946 (ordination was introduced in the 1940s), but the first women to be ordained and minister in Churches of Christ in Victoria (and Australia) were Pam Bowers and Robyn Haskell in 1973.William Tabbernee, ‚ÄòWomen and Pastoral Ministry in Churches of Christ‚Äô, Digest of the Australian Churches of Christ Historical Society, No. 103 (1989): Toward the end of the nineteenth century the denomination established a periodical, The Australian Christian, based in Victoria, which carried the news and opinion of the churches and their members for the next century.https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/22689646 In the early twentieth century Churches of Christ in Victoria developed significantly as a denomination, establishing institutional bodies and programs to further its mission. These included the establishment of a national training college for ministers located in Victoria, the College of the Bible (now Stirling Theological College), funds for chapel building, organised evangelism programs, cooperative ecumenical work, and a social services department.Graeme Chapman, One Lord, One Faith, One Baptism (1979), 86-7, 112, https://webfiles.acu.edu/departments/Library/HR/restmov_nov11/www.mun.ca/rels/restmov/texts/gchapman/ONELORD.HTM Each of these activities remain vital to the Churches of Christ in Victoria in the twenty-first century. =Queensland= A small group met in Albion, Brisbane in 1871, however it was not until 1 August 1882 that C.M. Fischer and T Geraghty established the first Church of Christ in Queensland at the Zillman Waterholes (now Zillmere, Queensland). The Ann Street Church of Christ was established in 1883 A century of witness, 1883-1983 / by Norman Watson and moved into its present building in Brisbane's central business district in 1898.Brisbane Travel Guide =South Australia= In March 1839, Robert Lawrie and his fianc√©e Margaret Mailey; Archibald Greenshields and Marion Greenshields (n√©e Lawrie) and their daughter Jane aged 2; Thomas Neill and family; all of Kilmarnock and nearby Newmilns,The reference cited has \\"Newmills\\", clearly a typographical error ‚Äî Newmills is in Ireland. applied on the same day with the same agent for free passage to South Australia, departing London 21 May 1839 on the ship Recovery and arriving in September 1839. In 1836, John Lawrie, older brother to the above-mentioned Lawries, had joined the Kilmarnock Scotch Baptist church, believing it to be the \\"true\\" church. But by 1837 John had become so influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell that he commenced Disciples meetings at Newmilns. All the above had been influenced by the Restoration movement; the Lawries (including James) and the Greenshields accepting its Biblical teaching. The coming to South Australia was due to Andrew Warnock of Paisley. Warnock was a manufacturer, but like other businessmen in Glasgow he was keen to invest in the new free colony of South Australia. Property was purchased for his son John Warnock, but as he knew nothing about farming, James Lawrie and William Wilson were employed to establish it. They left aboard the ship Ariadne in April 1839. The journey was long and hazardous: there were 223 passengers crowded onto the ship, and apart from all the dangers of illness, of storms, of rounding the Cape of Good Hope, a fire broke out on ship. Finally, in August 1839 their party, which included more persons than those listed above, arrived and were given or attained positions in the colony. Thomas Neill had been in business as a grocer in Kilmarnock and before that he had been a farm servant. It was intended that he should work on the Warnock property but on arrival it was discovered that the dry climate required many more acres to support a family than it did in Scotland. Fortunately for him he was immediately given a job as storekeeper with the South Australian Company by the manager, his old friend David McLaren. Neill had relations in Glasgow, Paisley and Kilmarnock. The Neills attended the Scotch Baptist church, built in Hindley Street by the Methodists then abandoned for their new building in Gawler Place. McLaren was the unofficial pastor, and later, Thomas, his wife Jean, and Agnes their daughter were listed as members in 1844 when the Scotch Baptists were meeting in Morphett Street. Upon arrival, James Lawrie went immediately south to Mertin Farm at Noarlunga; land that adjoins the Onkaparinga River. He was later joined by his brother Robert. William Wilson looked after another section of Mertin Farm. Another Scotch Baptist family from Glasgow arrived aboard Glenswilly in September 1839, the day before the Recovery. This was the Wauchope family, John, his wife and two sons, George and William. They settled on the property named Allandale in the Morphett Vale area. William worked for James and Robert on Mertin Farm. The major part of Mertin Farm lay not far below the Craig and Murray properties on the Onkaparinga River. In 1841 when David McLaren returned to England, the Adelaide congregation split over the question of \\"open communion.\\" A new group was formed at North Adelaide with Samuel Gill as minister. Alexander Murray with seven others were dismissed to form a church at Noarlunga. It is probable that the Noarlunga group consisted of Alexander and Jane Murray; James and Janet Craig; Archibald and Marion Greenshields; Robert and Margaret Lawrie; James Lawrie and William Wilson. Most of the above were connected through family relationship. This group could very well have been the source of some of Campbell's writings referred to as being in the Adelaide Scotch Baptist congregation and perhaps originally coming from John Lawrie. In March 1841 John Warnock arrived aboard John Cooper from Greenock, to take over Mertin Farm. The Lawrie brothers worked for Warnock for a time while he settled into the management of the farm, then moved out. James Craig and Alexander Murray, Scotch Baptists from Glasgow, arrived with their families in the ship India, in February 1840. They moved on to properties south of Adelaide. In October 1840 Craig bought a second section not far from his home property and made arrangements for Archibald Greenshields to manage it. In mid-1842 James Craig, caught in the financial crisis, was forced to sell the property that was managed by Greenshields. Greenshields became a labourer. Alexander Murray was able to survive for a time by accepting Robert Lawrie into joint occupancy of his property. Although the financial crisis of the colony had changed the fortunes of this little group, they managed, for a time, to remain in close proximity with each other. It is likely that the little southern congregation existed up until 1845 when Murray left for England and the Lawries shifted to Lonyunga in the Myponga Hills. It wasn't long after this that John Lawrie became concerned about the brethren \\"scattered over the wild prairie.\\" It was then that Lawrie persuaded his fellow elder, John Aird, to come to S.A. to take charge of the \\"little flock\\" in the south. John Aird and John Watson arrived in S.A. with their families on the ship Lady McNaughton/Lady MacNaghten, in October 1847. They met with the brethren at Franklin Street and then travelled to Noarlunga where Aird called his fellow restorationists together. They celebrated the Lord's Supper on October 31 and formed into a church on 7 November 1847. Thomas Magarey arrived in South Australia via New Zealand in 1845. He moved to Noarlunga after he was married to Elizabeth Verco on 10 March 1848. He worked in the local flour mill at the Horseshoe and for the 18 months to two years they were at Noarlunga, worshipped with the little group of disciples led by John Aird. Others in the congregation were: Watsons, Browns, Greenshields, Robert Lawries and Scotts. At the beginning of 1850, two years later, the Magareys returned to Hindmarsh, where Magarey wrote glowingly of the time spent with John Aird and the church at McLaren Vale. Alexander Lawrie came to live in the Myponga Hills in 1851. In 1855 he married Jane Watson, daughter of John Watson. John Lawrie arrived in the Myponga Hills November 1853. His wife and family joined him in November 1855. The church in the south had close links with the disciples in Adelaide. James Craig and John Brown represented the McLaren Vale church at the opening of the Hindmarsh church, 10 June 1855. Subscribers from the McLaren Vale church to the Grote Street building fund were: Aird, Brown, Craig, Jones, Greenshields, John Lawrie, Robert Lawrie, Watson, Scott. The Grote Street church building of the Christian Disciples was opened in December 1856. As a number of families lived in the Myponga Hills John Lawrie decided mid 1856 they should meet locally as the Willunga congregation. Members of the Willunga church appointed as Trustees of the Grote Street church on 27 June 1856:- John Lawrie and James Craig. John pointed out difficulties of country members acting as Trustees and so at a meeting on August 30, 1856, the previous country appointments were cancelled and Adelaide members appointed in place of those from Willunga and Milang. Late in 1857, John, Robert, Alexander Lawrie and families, sold their properties and moved north to farm the land at Alma Plains. Archibald Greenshields followed 3 or 4 years later and the Aird family later still. A chapel was built at Alma Plains in 1862 which doubled as a school room. The chapel soon became too small and a new Christian Disciples chapel was built 10 years later. T. J. Gore of Norwood and John Lawrie of Alma conducted the opening services to a large congregation. The following Monday some three or four hundred gathered for tea, after which John Lawrie presided over a meeting at which some five hundred heard addresses by Kidner, Colbourne, Woolcock, and Gore. Structure The State Conferences are: Victoria and Tasmania, New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory, Queensland, Western Australia, and the Australian Capital Territory. The Churches of Christ Provident Fund was established to support paid ministers. Most of its role has been handed over to the non-denominational Christian Super fund.

Samuelson was already skilled at aquaplaning‚Äîstanding on a board while being pulled by a powerboat‚Äîbut he hoped to create something like snow skiing on the water. Lake Pepin, a wide portion of the Mississippi River between Minnesota and Wisconsin, was the venue for his experiments. Patent Samuelson did not patent his invention, nor was his work sufficiently publicized at the time to prevent U.S. Patent 1,559,390 for water skis from being subsequently issued, on October 27, 1925, to prolific inventor Fred Waller of Huntington, New York. Waller marketed his product as \\"Dolphin Akwa- Skees.\\" Waller later invented the Cinema wide-screen motion picture system, and in 1952's \\"This is Cinerama,\\" the first feature film released in the panoramic format, water skiing at Cypress Gardens, Florida, was a prominently featured subject. Famed journalist Lowell Thomas was an early investor in Cinerama, and in his introduction to the book \\"Water Skiing\\" (1958, Prentice- Hall), by Dick Pope, Sr., creator of Cypress Gardens, Thomas described the connection between Waller and water skiing's prominence as a subject in the motion picture. In several instances in the book, Pope reiterates‚Äîerroneously, we now know‚Äîthat Waller was the first to invent water skis. Early attempts Samuelson's early attempts included using staves from wooden barrels and snow skis before he created new skis made of pine boards long and 9 inches wide (240 √ó 23 cm). He bent up the front tips after softening the wood by boiling them in his mother's copper kettle. Gaining confidence on the water, he began jumping wakes, but broke the original skis (the remains of which were believed to be found on a beach on Pepin) in one landing. His slightly modified second pair still exists; today they are at the Lake City Chamber of Commerce, in Lake City, Minnesota. Samuelson first succeeded on June 28 by starting off wearing skis while standing on top of an aquaplane board, and then slipping one foot and then the other into the water. Ski jumping He attracted a lot of attention locally in the following days and weeks. On July 8, 1925, Samuelson went on to perform the first ski jump on water. He fell flat in his first attempt, but soon greased the launch platform with lard and succeeded on the second try. Also that year, he became the first speed skier as he found himself racing across the water at , pulled by a Curtiss flying boat that flew just above the waves. Later years In his later years, Samuelson moved to Pine Island, Minnesota where he was a turkey farmer. He was a guest of honor at a water skiing 50th anniversary in 1972, and was inducted into the Water Ski Hall of Fame on January 22, 1977. When he returned to Minnesota, he began to suffer the effects of cancer, and died in Pine Island on August 28, 1977. References *Ralph Samuelson. Water Ski Hall of Fame. *Andreas Jordahl Rhude.

During the Kamakura period, it developed into buke-zukuri (Ê≠¶ÂÆ∂ÈÄ† housing for a military family). Structure The main characteristics of the shinden-zukuri are a special symmetry of the group of buildings and undeveloped space between them. A mansion was usually set on a one square. The main building, the , is on the central north‚Äìsouth axis and faces south on an open courtyard. Two subsidiary buildings, the , are built to the right and left of the shinden, both running east‚Äìwest. The tai-no-ya and the shinden are connected by two corridors called respectively sukiwatadono (ÈÄèÊ∏°ÊÆø) and watadono (Ê∏°ÊÆø). A ch≈´mon-r≈ç (‰∏≠ÈñÄÂªä, central gate corridor) at the half-way points of the two corridors lead to a south courtyard, where many ceremonies were celebrated. From the watadono, narrow corridors extend south and end in tsuridono, small pavilions that travel in a U-shape around the courtyard. Wealthier aristocrats built more buildings behind the shinden and tai-no-ya. The room at the core of the shinden (moya) is surrounded by a (one ken wide) roofed aisle called hisashi. The moya is one big space partitioned by portable screens (see List of partitions of traditional Japanese architecture). Guests and residents of the house are seated on mats, laid out separately on a polished wooden floor. As the style developed, the moya became a formal, public space, and the hisashi was divided into private spaces. Since the shinden-zukuri-style house flourished during the Heian period, houses tended to be furnished and adorned with characteristic art of the era. In front of the moya across the courtyard is a garden with a pond. Water runs from a stream (yarimizu ÈÅ£Ê∞¥) into a large pond to the south of the courtyard. The pond had islets and bridges combined with mountain shapes, trees, and rocks aimed at creating the feeling of being in the land of the Amida Buddha. Officers and guards lived by the east gates. File:Saik≈´ Historical Museum - Display item04 - The palace of Sai√¥ - Miniature model.jpgMuseum model of the palace of the Sai≈ç. The hisashi surrounds the moya. The moya is partitioned into an antechamber and a nurigome (Â°óÁØ≠), a 2√ó2 ken sleeping-space with plaster walls, containing a ch≈çdai (Â∏≥Âè∞ baldachin). The nurigome later shrank and moved into the hisashi. The rigid hinged rain shutters on the far side are hajitomi; the rolled blinds on the near side misu.

The Sai≈ç sits on a dais, with a by≈çbu behind her, a kich≈ç to her left, and a boxlike ch≈çdai (Â∏≥Âè∞, baldachin) to her right. Above and before her, a kabeshiro (Â£Å‰ª£, wall-curtain) is rolled and tied up. Other influenced styles =Buke-zukuri= The buke-zukuri was the style of houses built for military families. It was similar in structure to the regular shinden-zukuri with a few room changes to accommodate the differences between the aristocratic family and the military family. During the time when military families rose in power over the aristocrats, living quarters changed. Each lord had to build extra space in order to keep his soldiers around him at all times with their weapons within reach on the grounds in case of a sudden attack. To help guard against these attacks, a yagura or tower was built and torches were scattered around the gardens so they could be lit as quickly as possible. With the increase of people living under the same roof, extra rooms called hiro-bisashi (\\"spacious room under the eaves\\") were built grouped around the shinden. The zensho (ËÜ≥ÊâÄ kitchen) was also built bigger in order to accommodate the required people needed to cook all the food for the soldiers and members of the household. Unlike the shinden-zukuri, buke-zukuri homes were simple and practical, keeping away from the submersion into art and beauty that led to the downfall of the Heian court. Rooms characteristic of a buke-zukuri home are as follows:Perkins (1939:596‚Äì608) *Dei (Âá∫Â±Ö, reception room) *Saikusho (Á¥∞Â∑•ÊâÄ, armory) *Tsubone (Â±Ä, a shared place in the mansion) *Kuruma-yadori (ËªäÂÆø, a shelter for vehicles and cows) *Jibutsu-d≈ç (ÊåÅ‰ΩõÂ†Ç, a room in which the ancestral tablets and other symbols of Buddhist worship were kept) *Gakumon-j≈ç (place or room for study) *Daidokoro (kitchen) *Takibi-no-ma (ÁÑöÁÅ´Èñì, place for fire) *Baba-den (È¶¨Â†¥ÊÆø, horse-training room) *Umaya (Âé©, stable) The buke-zukuri style changed throughout the Kamakura and Muromachi periods, and over times the rooms in a buke-zukuri style house decreased as daimy≈çs started to use castles. =Shoin-zukuri= Extant examples There are no remaining original examples of Shinden-zukuri-style homes, however some current structures follow the same styles and designs: *Heian Palace *By≈çd≈ç-in's Phoenix Hall *H≈çj≈ç-ji See also * List of architectural styles * Roman villa Notes References *\\"The Rise and Decline of Bukezukuri\\" P.

It circulated alongside British and later Australian currency. The New Hebrides franc was nominally divided into 100 Centimes, although the smallest denomination was the 1 franc. Between 1945 and 1969, it was part of the CFP franc. History Until World War II, the New Hebrides used the French franc and the British and Australian pounds. In 1941, the Free French forces introduced paper money for circulation on the New Hebrides. In 1945, the CFP franc was introduced to insulate France's Pacific colonies from the devaluation of the French franc and the New Hebrides used a combination of New Caledonian franc coins and locally issued notes. In 1949, the CFP franc's relationship to the French franc stabilized at 5.5 French francs = 1 CFP franc. From 1959, the exchange rate to the Australian pound was almost exactly 200 francs = 1 pound. This rate became 100 francs = 1 Australian dollar in 1966 when the dollar was introduced. The Australian dollar circulated alongside the local currency. From 1966, coins were produced in the name of the New Hebrides. In 1969, the New Hebrides franc broke away from the CFP franc and maintained the relationship with the Australian dollar of 100 francs = 1 dollar until 1973. In 1981, the franc was replaced at par by the vatu following independence as Vanuatu. At the same time, the Australian dollar ceased to officially circulate. Coins In 1966, silver 100 franc coins were introduced. These were followed by nickel 10 and 20 francs in 1967, nickel-brass 1, 2 and 5 francs in 1970 and nickel 50 francs in 1972. Only the nickel coins (10, 20, and 50 francs) were the same size, composition, and obverse as the corresponding French Polynesian and New Caledonian coins. The overall design has not changed since the introduction of the New Hebrides franc coins. The only notable change is the addition of \\"I.E.O.M\\" (Institut d'√©mission d'Outre- Mer) in 1973. Banknotes First banknote of New Hebrides First banknote of New Hebrides The first New Hebridean banknote was issued in 1921, a 25 franc note of the Comptoirs Fran√ßais des Nouvelles H√©brides (French Trading Posts of the New Hebrides) dated 22 ao√ªt (August) 1921. This is a very rare note. The New Hebrides began issuing banknotes again in 1941. These were overprints on New Caledonian banknotes (issued by the Banque de l'Indochine), in denominations of 5, 20, 100, 500 and 1000 francs. The same denominations were issued in 1943 by the Free French Services Nationaux Fran√ßais des Nouvelles H√©brides. In 1965, the Institut d'Emission d'Outre-Mer took over the issuance of paper money on the New Hebrides and introduced notes in denominations of 100, 500 and 1000 francs between 1965 and 1972. Unlike the French Polynesian and New Caledonian counterparts, New Hebrides never had a 5000 franc note.

It originally aired on July 10, 2002. In the episode, the boys find out that their favorite movies are being changed, re-released and ruined in the process. In response, they form a club to \\"Save Films from their Directors.\\" Their goal is to stop certain famous authors from wrecking any more of their original masterpieces. They also cater to a group who demand a trailer-trash toddler murderer be freed. Much of the plot parodies Raiders of the Lost Ark. The episode ridicules Lucasfilm's digital altering of George Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy and Steven Spielberg's E.T.. The episode also criticizes remake movies. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker and is rated TV-MA in the United States, until 2020 when it shifted to TV-14.  Plot  Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Tweek get angry about Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' habit of altering their films with each \\"re-re-re-release\\" to make them more family-friendly or politically correct. They decide to form an organization to protect classic movies from changes. Cartman writes \\"Free Hat\\" on the advertising poster in the belief that freebies are necessary to attract people. However, the crowd mistakenly thinks the rally is to free Hat McCullough, a convicted baby killer they believe is innocent. The crowd focuses on persuading the governor to free Hat, while the boys appear on Nightline to explain their group's motives. Steven Spielberg and George Lucas appear on the show, and when the boys mention changing Raiders of the Lost Ark, the two directors quickly decide this is a great idea. Determined to stop them, the boys sneak into Lucas' house and steal the master print for the film, but are caught by him. Lucas calls the police, and the boys attempt to convince him to turn away Spielberg. As their attempts begin to sway him, Spielberg arrives flanked by guards and Lucas relents and gives Spielberg the film. The boys are taken prisoner to be guests at the film's premiere, but Tweek escapes. At the premiere is a trailer for a remastered version of South Parks pilot episode. Back at the club, Tweek alerts everybody else to the situation at hand, but the crowd remains obsessed with Hat McCullough. Meanwhile, Spielberg and Lucas, now joined by Francis Ford Coppola, start making their way to the premiere in a convoy with the film's print enclosed in an ark being carried. Tweek ambushes the convoy wielding a bazooka and threatens to blow it up unless the boys are released. The negotiation ends when Spielberg invites Tweek to \\"blow it back to God,\\" but reminds him all his life has been in pursuit of seeing a great film, and thanks to the new \\"effects beyond your wildest dreams\\" he wants to see it screened just as much as Spielberg does. Tweek pauses and is captured as he hesitates. At the premiere, Spielberg reveals his plan to destroy the original film afterwards, and the film begins. Knowing it will be horrible the boys look away while the audience watches. Parodying the climax of the actual Raiders of the Lost Ark, the altered version kills the audience. Coppola's head shrivels up, Lucas' face is melted off his skull and Spielberg's head explodes. When there is finally silence, the kids find themselves tie-free and open their eyes. Cartman observes, \\"That new version must've sucked balls.\\" Back in South Park, the boys think that they are going to be congratulated for stopping Spielberg and Lucas. However, the boys are congratulated for getting Hat released from prison instead. Despite the fact that Hat is obviously deranged and asks for a baby, the crowd cheers for him and presents him with one.

The reaction was first discovered in 1911 by Am√© Pictet and Theodor Spengler (February 22, 1886 - August 18, 1965). Traditionally an acidic catalyst in protic solvent was employed with heating, however the reaction has been shown to work in aprotic media in superior yields and sometimes without acid catalysis. The Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction can be considered a special case of the Mannich reaction, which follows a similar reaction pathway. The driving force for this reaction is the electrophilicity of the iminium ion generated from the condensation of the aldehyde and amine under acid conditions. This explains the need for an acid catalyst in most cases, as the imine is not electrophilic enough for ring closure but the iminium ion is capable of undergoing the reaction. The Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction The Pictet-Spengler reaction is widespread in both industry and biosynthesis. It has remained an important reaction in the fields of alkaloid and organic synthesis since its inception, where it has been employed in the development of many beta-carbolines. Natural Pictet-Spengler reaction typically an employ enzyme, such as strictosidine synthase. Pictet-Spengler products can be isolated from many products initially derived from nature, including foodstuffs such as soy sauce and ketchup. In such cases it is common to find the amino acid tryptophan and various aldoses used as the biological feedstock. Nucleophilic aromatic rings such as indole or pyrrole give products in high yields and mild conditions, while less nucleophilic aromatic rings such as a phenyl group give poorer yields or require higher temperatures and strong acid. The original Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction was the reaction of phenethylamine and dimethoxymethane, catalysed by hydrochloric acid forming a tetrahydroisoquinoline. The Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction has been applied to solid-phase combinatorial chemistry with great success. An analogous reaction with an aryl-Œ≤-ethanol is called oxa-Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction Reaction mechanism The reaction mechanism occurs by initial formation of an iminium ion (2) followed by electrophilic addition at the 3-position, in accordance with the expected nucleophilicity of indoles, to give the spirocycle 3. After migration of the best migrating group, deprotonation gives the product (5). The mechanism of the Pictet-Spengler reaction Variations =Pictet‚ÄìSpengler tetrahydroisoquinoline synthesis= Replacing an indole with a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group give the reaction named the Pictet‚ÄìSpengler tetrahydroisoquinoline synthesis. Reaction conditions are generally harsher than the indole variant, and require refluxing conditions with strong acids like hydrochloric acid, trifluoroacetic acid or superacids. The Pictet‚ÄìSpengler isoquinoline synthesis =N-acyliminium ion Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction= Instead of catalyzing the Pictet-Spengler cyclization with strong acid, one can acylate the iminium ion forming the intermediate N-acyliminium ion. The N-acyliminium ion is a very powerful electrophile and most aromatic ring systems will cyclize under mild conditions with good yields. The N-acyliminium Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction Tadalafil is synthesized via the N-acyliminium Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction. This reaction can also be catalyzed by AuCl3 and AgOTf. =Asymmetric Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction= When the Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reaction is performed with an aldehyde other than formaldehyde, a new chiral center is created. Several substrate- or auxiliary- controlled diastereoselective Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reactions have been developed.a) The intermolecular Pictet-Spengler condensation with chiral carbonyl derivatives in the stereoselective syntheses of optically-active isoquinoline and indole alkaloids Enrique L.

Additionally, List et al. have published a chiral Br√∏nsted acid that catalyzes asymmetric Pictet‚ÄìSpengler reactions. Tryptophans: diastereocontrolled reaction The reaction of enantiopure tryptophan or its short-chain alkylesters leads to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-Œ≤-carbolines in which a new chiral center at C-1 adopts either a cis or trans configuration towards the C-3 carboxyl group. The cis conduction is kinetically controlled, i.e. it is performed at lower temperatures. At higher temperatures the reaction becomes reversible and usually favours racemisation. 1,3-trans dominated products can be obtained with Nb-benzylated tryptophans, which are accessible by reductive amination. The benzyl group can be removed hydrogenolytically afterwards. As a rough rule, 13C NMR signals for C1 and C3 are downfield shifted in cis products relative to trans products (see steric compression effect).

Charles Knight created it for the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge in response to Chambers's Edinburgh Journal, which started two months earlier. Sold for only a penny and illustrated with wood-engravings, it was an expensive enterprise that could only be supported by very large circulation. Though initially very successful‚Äîwith a circulation of 200,000 in the first year‚Äîit proved too dry and too Whiggish to appeal to the working-class audience it needed to be financially viable. Its competitor‚Äîwhich included a weekly short story‚Äîgrew more slowly, but lasted much longer.Secord, Victorian Sensation, p. 68; Altick, English Common Reader, p. 333‚Äì4James A. Secord, Victorian Sensation: The Extraordinary Publication, Reception, and Secret Authorship of Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation. University of Chicago Press, 2000. Richard Altick, The English Common Reader: A Social History of the Mass Reading Public, 1800‚Äì1900. 2nd ed., Ohio State University Press, 1998.  Early success  During the first few years of publication The Penny Magazine was highly successful in building an audience selling over 200,000 copies in 1832 with an estimation of nearly one million readers that year and easily outselling other periodicals such as the Edinburgh Journal and The Saturday Magazine. = Price = There were several contributing factors behind this early success for The Penny Magazine. Firstly the price, as being sold for 1d. made it a financially viable option for the working-class audience it was intended for. Thus based on price alone there were few direct competitors for the periodical to be challenged by. The only direct competitor in this price range in 1832 was the Edinburgh Journal. = Use of non-radical information = Another aspect of its success as suggested by historians Rosemary Mitchell and A.L. Austin was the role of ‚Äònon-radical information‚Äô. Austin states that the timing of the publication of the periodical in the same year as the Reform Act of 1832 was significant as this meant that ‚Äúthe working classes expected parliamentary authority to consider the laboring community‚Äôs complaints‚Äù and that such questioning of authority led to a ‚Äúpublic shift toward rational inquiry‚Äù which could be found within the pages of The Penny Magazine. This outlook has been supported by Mitchell who also feels that the lack of controversial material was significant ‚Äúin the Penny Magazine‚Äôs appeal to a mass audience.‚Äù = Illustrations = An additional factor in the early success of the magazine was the consistent use of illustrations throughout its years of publication. The publisher Charles Knight favoured using the new reproductive medium of wood-engraving, which was cheaper than the steel-engraving alternative, to attract readers to his publication. Knight also had an advantage, due to being based inside London, he had access to a number of skilled engravers such as William Harvey, John Orrin Smith and Edmund Evans among others. It was through his association with inventor Edward Cowper, as well as the timing of the Industrial Revolution, that enabled him to take advantage of the steam printing press to produce more illustrations for The Penny Magazine. The use of pictures was also advantageous with the magazine‚Äôs target market as over 75% of school children were illiterate and another 300,000 did not attend school in 1832, the first year of publication. Similarly, in 1841 over 30% of males and nearly 50% of females were still illiterate, therefore using illustrations Knight was able to appeal to an audience with limited reading skills, while also enabling self-education. The illustrations became highly popular with Knight‚Äôs target audience as shown by the fact 1,887 illustrated articles were published in The Penny Magazine between the years of 1832 and 1845. The significant commercial value of illustrations for The Penny Magazine resulted in a whole front page being dedicated to a single picture. These images would often vary between machinery and animals. The popularity of illustrations and Knight‚Äôs desire for sales resulted in certain covers becoming scientifically inaccurate, for example an illustration of \\"The Boa Constrictor\\" (October 27, 1832) showed the creature attacking its prey with fangs drawn even though the reptile suffocates its prey. Austin argues that the idea of the snake striking at its prey was more likely to stir the reader‚Äôs emotions and entice them into purchasing the magazine. Ultimately it would be these illustrations, so vital to The Penny Magazine‚Äôs early success, which would lead to financial problems. Despite the production of an accompanying encyclopedia, The Penny Cyclopedia, the growing periodicals market caused Knight to lose significant market share whilst simultaneously having to pay more for illustrations to compete with other publishers. By 1833 Knight was paying over ¬£20,000 per annum, forcing him to raise the price of the magazine to 4d. and as a result he could not maintain his early commercial success.  The New Penny Magazine  In 1898 Cassell & Co, began publication of a new weekly magazine. It ran from 1898 to 1903 as The New Penny Magazine, from 1903 to January 1925 as The Penny Magazine and from February 1925 to August 1925, as Cassell's Popular Magazine. There were numerous illustrations and each volume, when sold as a bound book, contained the issues for three months. It was initially called The New Penny Magazine to avoid confusion with the earlier, The Penny Magazine.Antiqbook: Fine Books - Fair Prices. Accessed 8 October 2019.

The Omaha Reservation lies primarily in the southern part of Thurston County and northeastern Cuming County, Nebraska, but small parts extend into the northeast corner of Burt County and across the Missouri River into Monona County, Iowa. Its total land area is and a population of 5,194 was recorded in the 2000 census.Omaha Reservation, Nebraska/Iowa United States Census Bureau Its largest community is Macy. The Omaha people migrated to the upper Missouri area and the Plains by the late 17th century from earlier locations in the Ohio River Valley. The Omaha speak a Siouan language of the Dhegihan branch, which is very similar to that spoken by the Ponca. The latter were part of the Omaha before splitting off into a separate tribe in the mid-18th century. They were also related to the Siouan- speaking Osage, Quapaw, and Kansa peoples, who also migrated west under pressure from the Iroquois in the Ohio Valley. After pushing out other tribes, the Iroquois kept control of the area as a hunting ground. About 1770, the Omaha became the first tribe on the Northern Plains to adopt equestrian culture. Developing \\"The Big Village\\" (Ton-wa-tonga) about 1775 in current-day Dakota County in northeast Nebraska, the Omaha developed an extensive trading network with early European explorers and French Canadian voyageurs. They controlled the fur trade and access to other tribes on the Upper Missouri River. Omaha, Nebraska, the largest city in Nebraska, is named after them. Never known to take up arms against the U.S., the Omaha assisted the U.S. during the American Civil War. History The Omaha (Dhegihan) migration route to Nebraska as understood by J. Owen Dorsey The Omaha tribe began as a larger Woodland tribe comprising both the Omaha and Quapaw tribes. This tribe coalesced and inhabited the area near the Ohio and Wabash rivers around year 1600.Mathews (1961), The Osages As the tribe migrated west, it split into what became the Omaha and the Quapaw tribes. The Quapaw settled in what is now Arkansas and the Omaha, known as U-Mo'n-Ho'n (\\"upstream\\")John Joseph Mathews, The Osages: Children of the Middle Waters (University of Oklahoma Press 1961), pages 110, 128, 140, 282 settled near the Missouri River in what is now northwestern Iowa. Another division happened, with the Ponca becoming an independent tribe, but they tended to settle near the Omaha. The first European journal reference to the Omaha tribe was made by Pierre-Charles Le Sueur in 1700. Informed by reports, he described an Omaha village with 400 dwellings and a population of about 4,000 people. It was located on the Big Sioux River near its confluence with the Missouri, near present-day Sioux City, Iowa. The French then called it \\"The River of the Mahas.\\" Tribal territory of Omaha and other tribes In 1718, the French cartographer Guillaume Delisle mapped the tribe as \\"The Maha, a wandering nation\\", along the northern stretch of the Missouri River. French fur trappers found the Omaha on the eastern side of the Missouri River in the mid-18th century. The Omaha were believed to have ranged from the Cheyenne River in South Dakota to the Platte River in Nebraska. Around 1734 the Omaha established their first village west of the Missouri River on Bow Creek in present-day Cedar County, Nebraska. Around 1775 the Omaha developed a new village, probably located near present- day Homer, Nebraska. Ton won tonga (or Tonwantonga, also called the \\"Big Village\\"), was the village of Chief Blackbird. At this time, the Omaha controlled the fur trade on the Missouri River. About 1795, the village had around 1,100 people. Around 1800 a smallpox epidemic, resulting from contact with Europeans, swept the area, reducing the tribe's population dramatically by killing approximately one-third of its members. Chief Blackbird was among those who died that year. Blackbird had established trade with the Spanish and French, and used trade as a security measure to protect his people. Aware they traditionally lacked a large population as defense from neighboring tribes, Blackbird believed that fostering good relations with white explorers and trading were the keys to their survival. The Spanish built a fort nearby and traded regularly with the Omaha during this period.(2007) \\"History at a glance\\" , Douglas County Historical Society. Retrieved 2/2/08. After the United States made the Louisiana Purchase and exerted pressure on the trading in this area, there was a proliferation of different kinds of goods among the Omaha: tools and clothing became prevalent, such as scissors, axes, top hats and buttons. Women took on more manufacturing of goods for trade, as well as hand farming, perhaps because of evolving technology. Those women buried after 1800 had shorter, more strenuous lives; none lived past the age of 30. But they also had larger roles in the tribe's economy. Researchers have found through archeological excavations that the later women's skeletons were buried with more silver artifacts as grave goods than those of the men, or of women before 1800. After the research was completed, the tribe buried these ancestral remains in 1991. When Lewis and Clark visited Ton-wa-tonga in 1804, most of the inhabitants were gone on a seasonal buffalo hunt. The expedition met with the Oto people, who were also Siouan speaking. The explorers were led to the gravesite of Chief Blackbird before continuing on their expedition west. In 1815 the Omaha made their first treaty with the United States, one called a \\"treaty of friendship and peace.\\" No land was relinquished by the tribe. Semi-permanent Omaha villages lasted from 8 to 15 years. They created sod houses for winter dwellings, which were arranged in a large circle in the order of the five clans or gentes of each moitie, to keep the balance between the Sky and Earth parts of the tribe. Eventually, disease and Sioux aggression from the north forced the tribe to move south. Between 1819 and 1856, they established villages near what is now Bellevue, Nebraska and along Papillion Creek. =Loss of lands= Little Snake, an Omaha interpreter. By the Fourth Treaty of Prairie du Chien in 1831, the Omaha ceded their lands in Iowa to the United States, east of the Missouri River, with the understanding that they still had hunting rights there. In 1836 a treaty with the US took their remaining hunting lands in northwestern Missouri. During the 1840s, the Omaha continued to suffer from Sioux aggression. European-American settlers pressed the US government to make more land available west of the Mississippi River for white development. In 1846 Big Elk made an illegal treaty allowing a large group of Mormons to settle on Omaha land for a period; he hoped to gain some protection from competing natives by their guns, but the new settlers cut deeply into the game and wood resources of the area during the two years they were there.Boughter, Betraying the Omaha, pp. 49‚Äì50 For nearly 15 years in the 19th century, Logan Fontenelle was the interpreter at the Bellevue Agency, serving different US Indian agents. The mixed-race Omaha-French man was trilingual and also worked as a trader. His mother was Omaha; his father French Canadian. In January 1854 he acted as interpreter during the agent James M. Gatewood's negotiations for land cessions with 60 Omaha leaders and elders, who sat in council at Bellevue. Gatewood had been under pressure by Washington headquarters to achieve a land sale. The Omaha elders refused to delegate the negotiations to their gens chiefs, but came to an agreement to sell most of their remaining lands west of the Missouri to the United States. Competing interests may be shown by the draft treaty containing provisions for payment of tribal debts to the traders Fontenelle, Peter Sarpy, and Louis Saunsouci.Judith A. Boughter, Betraying the Omaha Nation, 1790‚Äì1916, University of Oklahoma Press, 1998, pp. 61‚Äì62 The chiefs at council agreed to move from the Bellevue Agency further north, finally choosing the Blackbird Hills, essentially the current reservation in Thurston County, Nebraska. The 60 men designated seven chiefs to go to Washington, DC for final negotiations along with Gatewood, with Fontenelle to serve as their interpreter.Melvin Randolph Gilmore, \\"The True Logan Fontenelle\\", Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, p. 64, at GenNet, accessed 25 August 2011 The chief Iron Eye (Joseph LaFlesche) was among the seven who went to Washington and is considered the last chief of the Omaha under their traditional system. Logan Fontenelle served as their interpreter, and whites mistakenly believed he was a chief. Because his father was white, the Omaha never accepted him as a member of the tribe, but considered him white. Although the draft treaty authorized the seven chiefs to make only \\"slight alterations,\\" the government officials forced major changes when they met. It took out the payments to the traders. It reduced the total value of annuities from $1,200,000 to $84,000, spread over years until 1895. It reserved the right to decide on distribution between cash and goods for the annuities. Last Omaha tribal hunt, December 1876 to March 1877. After 34 camp moves, the hunters found bison 400 miles outside the Omaha Reservation.Gilmore, Melvin R.: \\"Methods of Indian Buffalo Hunts, with the Itinerary of the Last Tribal Hunt of the Omaha\\". Papers of the Michigan Academy of Science, Arts and Letters. Vol.XVI, (1931), pp. 17-32. The tribe finally removed to the Blackbird Hills about 1856, and they first built a village in its traditional pattern. By the 1870s, bison were quickly disappearing from the plains, and the Omaha had to rely increasingly for survival upon their cash annuities and supplies from the United States Government and adaptation to subsistence agriculture. Jacob Vore was a Quaker appointed as US Indian agent to the Omaha Reservation under President Ulysses S. Grant. He started in September 1876, succeeding T.S. Gillingham, also a Quaker. Vore distributed a reduced annuity that year, just before the Omaha left on their annual buffalo hunt; according to his later account, he intended to \\"encourage\\" the Omaha to work at more agriculture.Jacob Vore, \\"The Omaha of Forty Years Ago\\", in Publications of the Nebraska State Historical Society, Vol. 19, edited by Albert Watkins, Nebraska State Historical Society, 1919, pp. 115‚Äì117, accessed 25 August 2011 They suffered a poor hunting season and severe winter, so that some were starving before late spring. Vore gained a supplement to the annuities which he had distributed, but for the remaining years of his tenure through 1879, distributed no cash annuities of the $20,000/year which was part of the treaty. Instead, he supplied goods: harrows, wagons, harnesses and various kinds of plows and implements to support the agricultural work. He told the tribe that Washington, DC officials had disapproved the annuity. The people had no recourse, and struggled to raise more produce, increasing the harvest to 20,000 bushels. The Omaha never took up arms against the U.S. Several members of the tribe fought for the Union during the American Civil War, as well as each subsequent war through today. Beginning in the 1960s, the Omaha began to reclaim lands east of the Missouri River, in an area called Blackbird Bend. After lengthy court battles and several standoffs, much of the area has been recognized as part Omaha tribal lands.Scherer, Mark R. (1998) \\"Imperfect Victory: The Legal Struggle for Blackbird Bend, 1966‚Äì1995\\", Annals of Iowa 57:38‚Äì71. The Omaha established their Blackbird Bend Casino on this reclaimed territory.About Blackbird Bend, = Archaeology = In 1989, the Omaha reclaimed more than 100 ancestral skeletons from Ton-wo-tonga, which had been held by museums. They had been excavated during archaeological work of the 1930s and 1940s, from grave sites with burials before and after 1800. Before having ceremonial reburial of the remains on Omaha lands, the tribe's representatives arranged for research at the University of Nebraska to see what could be learned from their ancestors.Paulette W. Campbell, \\"Ancestral Bones: Reinterpreting the Past of the Omaha\\" , Humanities, November/December 2002, Volume 23/Number 6, accessed 26 August 2011 Researchers found considerable differences in the community before and after 1800, as revealed in their bones and artifacts. Most significantly, they discovered that the Omaha were an equestrian Plains culture and buffalo hunters by 1770, making them the \\"first documented equestrian culture on the Northern Plains.\\" They also found that before 1800, the Omaha traded mostly in arms and ornaments. Men had many more roles in the patrilineal culture than did women: as \\"archers, warriors, gunsmiths, and merchants,\\" including the major ceremonial roles. Sacred bundles from religious ceremonies were found buried only with men. Culture In pre- settlement times, the Omaha had an intricately developed social structure that was closely tied to the people's concept of an inseparable union between sky (male principle) and earth (female); it was part of their creation story and their view of the cosmos. This union was viewed as critical to perpetuation of all living forms and pervaded Omaha culture. The tribe was divided into two moieties or half-tribes, the Sky People (Insta'shunda) and the Earth People (Hon'gashenu), each led by a different hereditary chief, who inherited power from his father's line. Sky people were responsible for the tribe's spiritual needs and Earth people for the tribe's physical welfare. Each moiety was composed of five clans or gente, which also had differing responsibilities. Each gens had a hereditary chief, through the male lines, as the tribe had a patrilineal kinship system of descent and inheritance. Children were considered to be born to their father's clan. Individuals married persons from another gens, not within their own. The hereditary chiefs and clan structures still existed at the time the elders and chiefs negotiated with the United States to cede most of their land in Nebraska in exchange for protection and cash annuities. Only men born into hereditary lines through their fathers, or formally adopted by a male into the tribe, as Joseph LaFlesche (Iron Eye) was by the chief Big Elk in the 1840s, could become chiefs. Big Elk designated LaFlesche as his son and successor chief of the Weszinste. LaFlesche, a man of mixed race, was the last recognized head chief selected by the traditional ways, and he was the only chief with any European ancestry.\\"Joseph La Flesche: Sketch of the Life of the Head Chief of the Omaha\\", first published in the (Bancroft, Nebraska) Journal; reprinted in The Friend, 1889, accessed 23 August 2011 He served for decades from 1853. Although whites considered Logan Fontenelle a chief, the Omaha did not. They used him as an interpreter; he was of mixed-race with a white father, so was considered white, as he had not been adopted by a man of the tribe. Today the Omaha host an annual pow wow. At the celebration, a committee elects the Omaha Pow Wow Princess. She serves as a representative in the community and a role model for younger children. =Dwellings= Omaha tipi. The Omaha earth lodge was substituted with a moveable tipi during hunts on the open plains. As the tribe migrated westward from the Ohio River region in the 17th century, they adapted to the Plains environment. They replaced the Woodland custom of bark lodges with tipis (borrowed from the Sioux) for the buffalo hunting and summer season, and built earth lodges (borrowed from the Arikara,Fletcher, Alice C. and Francis La Flesche: The Omaha Tribe. Lincoln and London, 1992. P. 112. called Sand Pawnee,Fletcher, Alice C. and Francis La Flesche: The Omaha Tribe. Lincoln and London, 1992. P. 102.) for the winter. Tipis were used primarily during buffalo hunts and when they relocated from one village area to another. They used earth lodges as dwellings during the winter. Omaha beliefs were symbolized in their dwelling structures. During most of the year, the Omaha lived in earth or sod lodges, ingenious structures with a timber frame and a thick sod covering. At the center of the lodge was a fireplace that recalled their creation myth. The earthlodge entrance was built to face east, to catch the rising sun and remind the people of their origin and migration upriver from the east. The Huthuga, the circular layout of tribal villages, reflected the tribe's beliefs. Sky people lived in the northern half-circle of the village, the area that symbolized the heavens. Earth people lived in the southern half, which represented the earth. The circle opened to the east. Within each half of the village, the clans or gentes were located based on their members' tribal duties and relationship to other clans. Earth lodges were as large as in diameter and might hold several families, even their horses. When the tribe removed to the Omaha Reservation about 1856, they initially built their village and earth lodges in the traditional patterns, with the half-tribes and clans in their traditional places in the layout. =Religion= The Omaha revere an ancient Sacred Pole, from before the time of their migration to the Missouri, made of cottonwood. It is called Umo‚Åø'ho‚Åø'ti (meaning \\"The Real Omaha\\") and considered to be a person.Alice C. Fletcher, and Francis La Flesche, The Omaha Tribe, Washington, D.C.: Twenty- Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, 1911 It was kept in a Sacred Tent in the center of the village, which only men who were members of the Holy Society could enter. An annual renewal ceremony was related to the Sacred Pole. In 1888 Francis La Flesche, a young Omaha anthropologist, helped arrange for his colleague Alice Fletcher to have the Sacred Pole taken to the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology at Harvard University, for preservation of it and its stories, at a time when the tribe's continuity seemed threatened by pressure for assimilation. The tribe was considering burying the Pole with its last keeper after his death. The last renewal ceremony for the pole was held in 1875, and the last buffalo hunt in 1876. La Flesche and Fletcher gathered and preserved stories about the Sacred Pole by its last keeper, Yellow Smoke, a holy man of the Hong'a gens. In the twentieth century, about 100 years after the Pole had been transferred, the tribe negotiated with the Peabody Museum for its return. The tribe planned to install the Sacred Pole in a cultural center to be built. When the museum returned the Sacred Pole to the tribe in July 1989, the Omaha held an August pow-wow in celebration and as part of their revival.Robin Ridington, \\"A Sacred Object as Text: Reclaiming the Sacred Pole of the Omaha Tribe\\", American Indian Quarterly 17(1): 83 ‚Äì 99, 1993, reprinted at Umo‚Åø'ho‚Åø Heritage, Omaha Tribe Website The Sacred Pole is said to represent the body of a man. The name by which it is known, a-kon-da-bpa, is the word used to designate the leather bracer worn upon the wrist for protection from the bow string (of the weapon of bow and arrow). This name demonstrates that the pole was intended to symbolize a man, as no other creature could wear a bracer. It also indicated that the man thus symbolized was one who was both a provider for and a protector of his people. Films *1990 ‚Äì The Return of the Sacred Pole.

This tanager is a resident breeder from Honduras to Panama, South America south to Ecuador and southern Brazil, and on Trinidad. It occurs in forests and cocoa plantations. The bulky cup nest is built in low vegetation, and the female lays three brown-blotched cream eggs. White-shouldered tanagers are 14 cm long and weigh 14 g. They are long-tailed and with a mostly black stout pointed bill. The adult male is glossy black, apart from white underwing coverts and a conspicuous white shoulder patch. The shoulder patch is the most obvious difference from the similar but larger white-lined tanager, in which the smaller white area is rarely visible except in flight. Females and immatures have olive upperparts, yellow underparts and a grey head and neck. These are restless birds which eat mainly insects, including stick insects, but will occasionally take fruit. They often associate with other insectivorous birds in wandering feeding flocks. The white-shouldered tanager's song is a fast repetitive tchirrup.

He was also one of the primary theorists of Buddhist atomism. His works influenced the scholars of Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ, Nyaya and Shaivism schools of Hindu philosophy as well as scholars of Jainism. Dharmakƒ´rti's PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika, his largest and most important work, was very influential in India and Tibet as a central text on pramana ('valid knowledge instruments') and was widely commented on by various Indian and Tibetan scholars. His texts remain part of studies in the monasteries of Tibetan Buddhism. History Little is known for certain about the life of Dharmakirti. Tibetan hagiographies suggest he was a Brahmin born in South India and was the nephew of the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ scholar KumƒÅrila Bha·π≠·π≠a. When he was young, KumƒÅrila spoke abusively towards Dharmakirti as he was taking his brahminical garments. This led Dharmakirti to take the robes of the Buddhist order instead, resolving to \\"vanquish all the heretics.\\" As a student of Buddhism, he first studied under Isvarasena, and later moved to Nalanda where he interacted with 6th century Dharmapala. However, the accuracy of the Tibetan hagiographies is uncertain, and scholars place him in the 7th-century instead. This is because of inconsistencies in different Tibetan and Chinese texts, and because it is around the middle of 7th-century, and thereafter, that Indian texts begin discussing his ideas, such as the citation of Dharmakirti verses in the works of Adi Shankara. Dharmakƒ´rti is placed by most scholars to have lived between 600‚Äì660 CE, but a few place him earlier. Dharmakirti is credited with building upon the work of DignƒÅga, the pioneer of Buddhist logic, and Dharmakirti has ever since been influential in the Buddhist tradition. His theories became normative in Tibet and are studied to this day as a part of the basic monastic curriculum. Dharmakirti worked at Nalanda as a lay Buddhist, not as an ordained monk, and his work reflects his belief that no one will understand the value of his work, his efforts soon forgotten. History proved his fears wrong. Philosophy =Historical context= The Buddhist works such as the Yogacarabhumi-sastra and the MahƒÅyƒÅnas≈´trƒÅla·πÖkƒÅra composed before the 6th century, on hetuvidyƒÅ (logic, dialectics) are unsystematic, whose approach and structure are heresiological, proselytical and apologetic. Their aims were to defeat non-Buddhist opponents (Hinduism, Jainism, ƒÄjƒ´vikism, others), defend the ideas of Buddhism, develop a line of arguments that monks can use to convert those who doubt Buddhism and to strengthen the faith of Buddhists who begin to develop doubts. Around the middle of the 6th century, possibly to address the polemics of non-Buddhist traditions with their pramana foundations, the Buddhist scholar DignƒÅga shifted the emphasis from dialectics to more systematic epistemology and logic, retaining the heresiological and apologetic focus. Dharmakƒ´rti followed in DignƒÅga footsteps, and is credited with systematic philosophical doctrines on Buddhist epistemology, which Vincent Eltschinger states, has \\"a full-fledged positive/direct apologetic commitment\\". Dharmakƒ´rti lived during the collapse of the Gupta Empire, a time of great insecurity for Buddhist institutions. The role of Buddhist logic was seen as an intellectual defense against Hindu philosophical arguments formulated by epistemically sophisticated traditions like the Nyaya school. However, Dharmakƒ´rti and his followers also held that the study of reasoning and its application was an important tool for soteriological ends. =Epistemology= Buddhist epistemology holds that perception and inference are the means to correct knowledge. Dharmakƒ´rti's philosophy is based on the need to establish a theory of logical validity and certainty grounded in causality. Following DignƒÅga's PramƒÅ·πáasamuccaya, Dharmakƒ´rti also holds that there are only two instruments of knowledge or 'valid cognition' (pramƒÅ·πáa); \\"perception\\" (pratyaksa) and \\"inference\\" (anumƒÅ·πáa). Perception is a non- conceptual knowing of particulars which is bound by causality, while inference is reasonable, linguistic and conceptual. In the PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika Dharmakƒ´rti defines a pramana as a \\"reliable cognition\\". What it means for a cognition to be reliable has been interpreted in different ways. Following commentators like Dharmottara, who define it as meaning that a cognition is able to lead to the obtaining of one's desired object, some modern scholars such as Jose I. Cabezon have interpreted Dharmakƒ´rti as defending a form of Pragmatism.Cabez√≥n, Jos√© I., 2000, \\"Truth in Buddhist Theology,\\" in R. Jackson and J. Makransky, (eds.), Buddhist Theology, Critical Reflections by Contemporary Buddhist Scholars. London: Curzon, 136‚Äì154. Tillemans sees him as holding to a weak form of correspondence theory, which holds that to \\"confirm causal efficacy\\" (arthakriyƒÅsthiti) is to have a justification that an object of cognition has the causal powers we expected. That justification comes through a certain kind of non-conceptual perception (pratyak·π£a) which is said to be an \\"intrinsical source of knowledge\\" (svata·∏• prƒÅmƒÅ·πáya) which is ultimately reliable. Dharmakƒ´rti sees a cognition as being valid if it has a causal connection with the object of cognition through an intrinsically valid, un-conceptual perception of the object which does not err regarding its functionality. As Dharmakirti says: \\"A pramƒÅ·πáa is a reliable cognition. [As for] reliability, it consists in [this cognition's] compliance with [the object's capacity to] perform a function\\" (PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika 2.1ac). Dharmakƒ´rti also holds that there were certain extraordinary epistemic warrants, such as the words of the Buddha, who was said to be a authoritative/reliable person (pramƒÅ·πáapuru·π£a) as well as the 'inconceivable' perception of a yogi (yogipratyak·π£a). On the role of scriptural authority, Dharmakƒ´rti has a moderate and nuanced position. For Dharmakƒ´rti, scripture (Buddhist or otherwise) is not a genuine and independent mean of valid cognition. He held that one should not use scripture to guide one on matters which can be decided by factual and rational means and that one is not to be faulted for rejecting unreasonable parts of the scriptures of one's school. However scripture is to be relied upon when dealing with \\"radically inaccessible things\\", such as the laws of karma and soteriology. However according to Dharmakƒ´rti scripture is a fallible source of knowledge and has no claim to certainty. =Metaphysics= According to Buddhologist Tom Tillemans, Dharmakƒ´rti's ideas constitute a nominalist philosophy which disagrees with the Madhyamaka philosophy, by asserting that some entities are real. Dharmakƒ´rti states that the real is only the momentarily existing particulars (svalak·π£a·πáa), and any universal (sƒÅmƒÅnyalak·π£a·πáa) is unreal and a fiction. He criticized the Nyaya theory of universals by arguing that since they have no causal efficacy, there is no rational reason to posit them. What is real must have powers (≈õakti), fitness (yogyatƒÅ) or causal properties which is what individuates a real particular as an object of perception. Dharmakƒ´rti writes \\"whatever has causal powers (arthakriyƒÅsamartha), that really exists (paramƒÅrthasat).\\" This theory of causal properties has been interpreted as a form of trope theory. Svalak·π£a·πáa are said to be part-less, undivided and property-less, and yet they impart a causal force which give rise to perceptual cognitions, which are direct reflections of the particulars. Dharmakƒ´rti's ultimately real (paramƒÅrthasat) particulars are contrasted with conventionally real entities (sa·πÉv·πõtisat) as part of his presentation of the Buddhist Two truths doctrine. The conventionally real for him are based on linguistic categories, intellectual constructs and erroneous superimpositions on the flow of reality, such as the idea that universals exist. According to Dharmakƒ´rti, cognitive distortion of the direct perception of particulars occurs during the process of recognition (pratyabhij√±ƒÅna) and perceptual judgment (ni≈õcaya) which arises due to latent tendencies (vƒÅsanƒÅ) in the mind left over from past impressions of similar perceptions. These latent dispositions come together into constructed representations of the previously experienced object at the moment of perception, and hence it is an imposed error on the real, a pseudo-perception (pratyak·π£ƒÅbhƒÅsa) which conceals (sa·πÉv·πõti) reality while at the same time being practically useful for navigating it. Ignorance (avidyƒÅ) for Dharmakƒ´rti is conceptuality, pseudo-perception and superimposition overlaid on the naturally radiant (prabhƒÅsvara) nature of pure perception. By correcting these defilements of perception through mental cultivation as well as using inference to gain \\"insight born of (rational) reflection\\" (cintƒÅmayƒ´ praj√±ƒÅ) a Buddhist yogi is able to better see the true nature of reality until his perception is fully perfected. Dharmakƒ´rti, again following DignƒÅga, also holds that that things as they are in themselves are \\"ineffable\\" (avyapade≈õya). Language is never about the things in themselves, only about conceptual fictions, hence they are nominalists. Due to this theory, the main issue for Dharmakirti becomes how to explain that it is possible for our arbitrary and conventional linguistic schemas to refer to perceptual particulars which are ineffable and non conceptual. To explain this gap between conceptual schema and perceptual content, Dharmakirti takes up Dignaga's theory of \\"exclusion\\" (apoha). DignƒÅga's view is that \\"a word talks about entities only as they are qualified by the negation of other things.\\" Dharmakƒ´rti's unique take on this nominalist theory, which underlies his entire system, is to reinterpret it in terms of causal efficacy‚ÄîarthakriyƒÅ (which can also be translated as 'telic function', 'functionality', and 'fulfillment of purpose'). Dharmakƒ´rti developed his philosophical system to defend Buddhist doctrines, so it is no surprise that he developed a number of arguments for rebirth, the Four Noble Truths, the authority of the Buddha, karma, anatta and compassion as well as attacking Brahminical views such as the authority of the Vedas. Dharmakƒ´rti also defended the Buddhist theory of momentariness (k·π£a·πáikatva), which held that dharmas spontaneously perish the moment they arise. Dharmakƒ´rti came up with an argument for the theory which stated that since anything that really exists has a causal power, the fact that its causal power is in effect proves it is always changing. For Dharmakƒ´rti, nothing could be a cause while remaining the same, and any permanent thing would be causally inert. =Philosophy of mind= Dharmakƒ´rti defends DignƒÅga's theory of consciousness being non-conceptually reflexive (svasamvitti or svasa·πÉvedana). This is the idea that an act of intentional consciousness is also aware of itself as aware. Consciousness is said to illuminate itself like a lamp that illuminates objects in a room as well as itself. Dharmakƒ´rti also defends the YogƒÅcƒÅra theory of \\"awareness-only\\" (vij√±aptimƒÅtratƒÅ), which held that 'external objects' of perception do not exist. According to Dharmakƒ´rti, an object of cognition is not external or separate from the act of cognition itself. This is because the object is \\"necessarily experienced simultaneously with the cognition [itself]\\" (PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika 3.387). The view that there is a duality (dvaya) between an object (grƒÅhya) and a subjective cognition (grƒÅhaka) arises out of ignorance. Dharmakƒ´rti's Substantiation of Other Mindstreams (Sa·πÉtƒÅnƒÅntarasiddhi) is a treatise on the nature of the mindstream and Buddhist response to the problem of other mindsSource: (accessed: Wednesday 28 October 2009). There is an English translation of this work by Gupta (1969: pp.81‚Äì121) which is a rendering of Stcherbatsky's work from the Russian: Gupta, Harish C. (1969). Papers of Th. Stcherbatsky. Calcutta: Indian Studies Past and Present. (translated from Russian by Harish C. Gupta). Dharmakirti held the mindstream to be beginning-less yet also described the mindstream as a temporal sequence, and that as there are no true beginnings, there are no true endings, hence, the \\"beginningless time\\" motif that is frequently used to describe the concept of mindstream. =Affiliation= There is disagreement among Indian and Tibetan doxographers as to how to categorise Dharmakƒ´rti's thought. The Gelug school asserts that he expressed YogƒÅcƒÅra views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators assert that he expressed SautrƒÅntika views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas asserted that he expressed Madhyamaka views.Ngawang Palden in the Sautrantika chapter of his Explanation of the Conventional and the Ultimate in the Four Systems of Tenets (Grub mtha' bzhi'i lugs kyi kun rdzob dang don dam pa'i don rnam par bshad pa legs bshad dpyid kyi dpal mo'i glu dbyangs, New Delhi: Guru Deva, 1972, 39.5‚Äì39.6) says that some such as Praj√±akaragupta, Suryagupta, Shantarakshita, Kamalashila, and Jetari interpret Dharmakirti's Commentary on [Dignaga's] Compendium of Valid Cognition (Tshad ma rnam 'grel, Pramanavarttika) as a Madhyamika treatise. Dependent-Arising and Emptiness: A Tibetan Buddhist Interpretation of Madhyamika Philosophy Emphasizing the Compatibility of Emptiness and Conventional Phenomena Napper, Elizabeth. Boston: Wisdom Publications. p. 685, note 142 Among modern scholars, some like Tillemans argue that Dharmakƒ´rti represented the YogƒÅcƒÅra school, while Amar Singh argues that he was a SautrƒÅntika.Singh, Amar; The Heart of Buddhist Philosophy: Dinnaga and Dharmakƒ´rti, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1984. xvi + 168 pp. Appendices, glossary, bibliography and indices. For Christine Mullikin Keyt, Dharmakƒ´rti represents a \\"synthesis of two schools of Indian Buddhism, the Sautrantika and the Yogacara.\\"Keyt, Christine Mullikin; Dharmakƒ´rti's concept of the Svalak·π£a·πáa, 1980, https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/5723 Likewise, Dan Arnold argues that Dharmakƒ´rti's alternating philosophical perspectives of SautrƒÅntika and YogƒÅcƒÅra views are ultimately compatible and are applied at different levels of his 'sliding scale of analysis.'Arnold, Dan; Buddhist Idealism, Epistemic and Otherwise: Thoughts on the Alternating Perspectives of Dharmakƒ´rti, 2008 There is also a tendency to see DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti as founding a new type of Buddhist school or tradition, which is known in Tibetan as \\"those who follow reasoning\\" () and sometimes is known in modern literature as pramƒÅ·πáavƒÅda. Writings and commentaries Dharmakƒ´rti is credited with the following major works: *Sa·πÉbandhaparik·π£hƒÅvrtti (Analysis of Relations) *PramƒÅ·πáavini≈õcaya (Ascertainment of Valid Cognition) *PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttika-kƒÅrika (Commentary on Dignaga's 'Compendium of Valid Cognition') *PramƒÅ·πáavƒÅrttikasvavrtti (Auto-commentary on the above text) *NyƒÅyabinduprakara·πáa (Drop of Logic) *HetubindunƒÅmaprakara·πáa (Drop of Reason) *Sa·πÉtƒÅnƒÅntarasiddhinƒÅmaprakara·πáa (Proof of Others' Mindstreams) *VƒÅdanyƒÅyanƒÅmaprakara·πáa (Reasoning for Debate) There are various commentaries by later thinkers on Dharmakƒ´rti, the earliest commentators are the Indian scholars Devendrabuddhi (ca. 675 C E.) and Sakyabuddhi (ca. 700 C.E.).

He was considered by Filipinos, particularly the Visayans, as the third head of Panay (an island in Visayas with four provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz and Iloilo). He was a source of fierce Filipino and Visayan pride for decades, until his authenticity was debunked by Historian William Henry Scott in his PhD thesis, Critical Study of the Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History relegating the once legendary historical figure into a mythical Filipino character or an urban legend. History Kalantiaw's name first appeared in print in July 1913 in an article entitled \\"Civilizaci√≥n prehispana\\" published in the Philippine news-magazine Renacimiento Filipino. The article mentioned 16 laws enacted by King Kalantiaw in 1433 and a fort that he built at Gagalangin, Negros, which was destroyed by an earthquake in the year A.D. 435 (not 1435). The article was written by Manuel Artigas who, only a year before, had provided the footnotes to an essay by Jos√© Marco, Rese√±a historica de la Isla de Negros. In 1914, Jos√© Marco donated five manuscripts to Dr. James A. Robertson for the Philippine Library and Museum. Robertson called Marco \\"a good friend to the institution\\" and his earliest contributions, \\"the greatest literary discovery ever made in the archipelago.\\" Among the documents was Las Antiguas leyendes de la Isla de Negros, a two volume leather bound work that was supposedly written by a Friar Jos√© Mar√≠a Pav√≥n in 1838 and 1839. The Code of Kalantiaw, in chapter 9 of part 1, was one of six translated documents that were dated before the arrival of the Spaniards in the Philippines. The original Code was purportedly discovered in the possession of a Panay datu in 1614. At the time of Pav√≥n's writing in 1839 it was supposedly owned by a Don Marcelio Orfila of Zaragoza. On July 20, 1915, Robertson submitted a paper about the Kalantiaw Code to the Panama- Pacific Historical Congress in California and then published an English translation of the Code in 1917. The historian Josue Soncuya published a Spanish translation of the code in 1917, and wrote about it in his book Historia Prehispana de Filipinas (Prehispanic History of the Philippines). Soncuya concluded that the Code had been written for Aklan because of the presence of two Aklanon rather than Hiligaynon words in the text, and the words Aklan, Panay Island were added to later versions of Soncuya's translation (viz. \\"Echo en al a√±o 1433‚ÄìCalantiao‚Äì3¬∞ regulo\\").. In 1949, Gregorio Zaide included the Kalantiaw Code in his Philippine Political and Cultural History with the words \\"Aklan, Panay\\" attached to the title. In 1956, Digno Alba declared in his book Paging Datu Kalantiaw that the Datu had set up his government in Batan and made it the capital of the sakup of Aklan. On June 1, 1956, acting upon the request of the Municipal Council of Batan, the Philippine Historical Committee installed a marker in a tract of land near the bay. This was unveiled on December 8, 1956. On February 11, 1957, President Ramon Magsaysay approved Executive Order No. 234 declaring the site as a national shrine. A former school building in the town was converted into the Kalantiaw Shrine by the Philippine Historical and Cultural Society and the Code of Kalantiaw was later inscribed there in brass. Kalantiaw was honoured by the Philippine Navy in December 1967 when it acquired the World War II destroyer escort USS Booth from the United States and recommissioned it the RPS Datu Kalantiaw. That vessel was the flagship of the Philippine Navy from 1967 to 1981. On March 1, 1971, President Ferdinand Marcos instituted the \\"Order of Kalantiaw\\", an award \\"for services to the country in the areas of law and justice\\" (Executive Order No. 294). Then January 24, 1973, President Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 105 declaring national shrines such as sacred (hallowed) places and prohibiting desecration thereof. On June 19, 1978 a 30-centavo postage stamp was released in honour of \\"Rajah Kalantiaw\\". Debunking the Code In 1965, William Henry Scott was a doctoral candidate at the University of Santo Tomas when the bibliographer Mauro Garcia suggested that for his thesis he examine the history of the Philippines before the arrival of the Spaniards. Garcia had received several fake documents from Jos√© Marco in the past, which made him suspicious of Marco's first discoveries upon which so much early history was based. He only showed a few of these forgeries to Scott so as not to prejudice his research, saving the most blatant fakes until after Scott had formed his own conclusions about Marco's work. Historian William Henry Scott asserted in his PhD thesis, Critical Study of the Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine History that there is no evidence that any Filipino ruler by the name of Kalantiaw ever existed or that the Kalantiaw penal code is any older than 1914. Scott successfully defended the thesis in 1968 before a panel of eminent Filipino historians which included Teodoro Agoncillo, Horacio de la Costa, Marcelino Foronda, Nicolas Zafra, and Gregorio Zaide. The thesis was published by University of Santo Tomas Press Press in 1968.. Aftermath William H. Scott's expos√© did not have an immediate effect on Filipino society. On March 1, 1971, President Ferdinand Marcos instituted the \\"Order of Kalantiaw\\", an award \\"for services to the country in the areas of law and justice\\" (Executive Order No. 294). That same year a beauty pageant winner was crowned \\"Lakambini ni Kalantiaw\\" on the supposed anniversary of the Code (December 8), and the artist Carlos Valino Jr. depicted Kalantiaw issuing his commandments (See painting above). On January 24, 1973, Marcos also issued Presidential Decree No. 105, which declared that the Kalantiaw Shrine, and all national shrines, were sacred. The decree prohibited all forms of desecration including \\"unnecessary noise and committing unbecoming acts.\\" Like Kalantiaw's Code, the penalty was hefty; \\"imprisonment for not less than ten (10) years or a fine not less than ten thousand pesos (P10,000) or both.\\" Gregorio F. Zaide, the author of countless school textbooks and a member of the very dissertation panel that examined Scott's thesis in 1968 remained silent but he continued to endorse the myth and even add his own details to it in books such as Heroes of Philippine History (1970), Pageant of Philippine History (1979), History of the Republic of the Philippines (1983), Philippine History (1984), and in reissues of his older works. Soon after Dr. Zaide's death in 1986 his daughter, Sonia M. Zaide, revised the books that she had co-authored with her father and removed most, but not all, of the material based on the Marco hoaxes. In 1994 the playwright Rene O. Villanueva dramatized the life of Jose E. Marco and the creation of the Kalantiaw hoax in the play Kalantiaw, Kagila- gilalas na Kasinungalingan (The Amazing Lie). Villanueva's intriguing story proposed that Marco's motivation for creating his frauds was his intense admiration for his personal hero, Jose Rizal. Marco's ambition was to better the accomplishments of Rizal by inventing a glorious past to fill the gaps in Filipino history. The NHI admitted that Kalantiaw was a hoax in 1998 when Chief Justice Andres Narvasa, who was about to receive the Kalantiaw Award, asked Malaca√±ang to look into the matter. President Joseph Estrada gave him the award anyway. In 2005, the NHI, under the leadership of Ambeth Ocampo, made their opinion official when they submitted a resolution to President Arroyo to revoke the national shrine status of the Kalantiaw Shrine in Aklan. That resolution, National Historical Institute (NHI) Resolution No. 12 of 2004, declared \\"[...] that Code of Kalantiao/Kalantiaw has no Valid Historical Basis\\". The NHI called for: (1) the official affirmation that the Kalantiaw Code is a twentieth-century fraudulent work by Jose Marco, (2) the President of the Philippines cease to honor retiring Supreme justices and other international dignitaries with the 'Order of Kalantiaw', and (3) the revoking of Executive Order 234, which declared the municipality of Batan, Province of Aklan as a national shrine. This NHI resolution was approved by the Office of the President in 2005 and taken into effect immediately, despite strong protests from the people of the province of Aklan. Some Filipinos, both scholars and non-scholars, continue to believe that the Code of Kalantiaw and the datu/chieftain who supposedly promulgated these laws actually existed. In a 2001 International conference presentation on 'The Philippine Judicial System', Dr. Raul Pangalangan, Dean, College of Law from the University of the Philippines said, \\"[...] all ancient written laws of the Filipinos were lost with the exception of the Code of Maragtas and the Code of Kalantiaw, both from Panay Island.\\" During the Philippine House of Representative 2nd Regular Session in August 2008, Congressman Aurora Cerilles referred to the signing of the Code of Kalantiaw in Panay saying, \\"That is why there is the so-called 'The Code of Kalantiaw,' where a person called Marikudo signed a treaty with Sumakwel\\". Impact in Filipino literature, arts and culture Before and despite of his inauthenticity, Kalantiao has left an indelible mark in the lives of Filipinos, embracing his character as part of their heritage. Inside the National Museum of the Philippines (formerly the Legislative Building), Kalantiao is portrayed alongside 13 other sculptures of renowned historical lawmakers & legislators of the world on the entablature of the Senate Session Hall, which survived the rampant devastation of the Battle of Manila of February 1945, and has been mostly restored to its pre-War state. In 2003, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed executive order 236, consolidating the current Philippine honours system and, in it, the \\"Order of Kalantiao\\" ceased being an honour. However, the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Executive Order did list the Order of Kalantiaw as one of the Honors of the Philippines. The Central Philippine University in Iloilo has its own \\"Order of Kalantiao\\", a fraternity that was at the centre of a serious hazing incident in September 2001. Even the National Historical Institute (NHI) honoured Kalantiaw in 1989 by including him in volume 4 of their five volumes of Filipinos in History. The Gintong Pamana (Golden Heritage) Awards Foundation, a project of Philippine Time USA Magazine, rewards community leadership among Filipino-Americans with the \\"Kalantiaw Award\\". Buildings, streets and banquet halls throughout the Philippines still bear the name of the mythical ruler of Panay and tourists can still visit the Kalantiaw Shrine in Batan, Aklan or even pass by a local high school, Kalantiaw Institute. In the movies, there is Alagad ni Kalantiao starred by Lito Lapid. In television, a fantasy series was aired in 1986 in GMA Network entitled Mga Alagad ni Kalantiao about three people who each has a rod when formed in triangle transforms them into superheroes.

It is extremely technically demanding and considered to be among the most taxing of Liszt's works and in the entire repertoire. For this reason, and perhaps also because of its length and dramatic intensity, it does not appear in concert programmes as often as Liszt's lighter and more popular pieces, such as the Rigoletto Paraphrase. As Ferruccio Busoni says in the preface to his 1918 edition of the work, the R√©miniscences carries \\"an almost symbolic significance as the highest point of pianism.\\" Liszt wrote the work in 1841 and published a two-piano version (S. 656) in 1877. The two-piano version bears a structurally strong resemblance to the original. The piece begins with music sung by the Commendatore, both from the graveyard scene where he threatens Don Giovanni (\\"Di rider finirai pria dell'aurora! Ribaldo audace! Lascia a' morti la pace!\\" -- \\"Your laughter will not last, even till morning. Leave the dead in peace!\\") and from the finale where he condemns Don Giovanni to Hell. The love duet of Don Giovanni and Zerlina follows (\\"L√† ci darem la mano\\"), along with two variations on this theme, then an extended fantasy on the Champagne aria (\\"Fin ch'han dal vino\\"), and finally the work concludes with the Commendatore's threat. In contrast to perhaps the majority of opera fantasies composed during the nineteenth century, Liszt's Don Giovanni paraphrase is a much more tightly controlled and significant work. Where the standard opera transcription is merely a collection of famous tunes, > The finest of [Liszt's] opera fantasies...are much more than that: they > juxtapose different parts of the opera in ways that bring out a new > significance, while the original dramatic sense of the individual number and > its place within the opera is never out of sight. Throughout the work, the R√©miniscences makes a great number of advanced technical demands on the pianist, among them passages in chromatic thirds, numerous tenths, and an instance of rapid leaps in both hands across almost the whole width of the keyboard that, in the words of Heinrich Neuhaus, \\"with the exception of Ginzburg, probably nobody but the pianola played without smudges.\\" It was the final piece for Horowitz's graduation concert at the Kiev's conservatory; at the end all the professors stood up to express their approval. Horowitz, after claiming to Backhaus that the most difficult piano piece he ever played was Liszt's Feux-follets without hesitation, he added that R√©miniscences de Don Juan is not an easy piece either. Horowitz had it in his concert programs, as well as the Liszt Sonata, which was not often played at the time, in his early years in Europe. Alexander Scriabin injured his right hand overpracticing this piece and Balakirev's Islamey, and wrote the funeral march of his First Piano Sonata in memory of his damaged hand. Celebrated recordings of the R√©miniscences include those by Jorge Bolet, Earl Wild, Simon Barere, Grigory Ginzburg, Louis Kentner, Charles Rosen, Leslie Howard and Leo Sirota. More recent versions have been recorded by Marc-Andr√© Hamelin, Valentina Lisitsa, Matthew Cameron, Min Kwon, and Lang Lang.

Reid Sir Robert Gillespie Reid (12 October 1842, Coupar Angus, Perthshire, Scotland - 3 June 1908) was a Scottish railway contractor most famous for building large railway bridges in Canada and the United States. Founder of Reid Newfoundland Company, from 1889 until his death, he built, owned, and operated the Newfoundland Railway. Early career As a young man, Reid spent a few years in Australia mining gold. In 1871, Reid settled in North America, where he began his career as a contractor. He built one section of the Canadian Pacific Railway, and was responsible for the erection of the international bridge over the Niagara River, the international railway bridge over the Rio Grande and the Lachine bridge over the St. Lawrence. Newfoundland Reid brought his business ventures to Newfoundland in 1889. In 1893, he signed a contract with the government of Newfoundland, and as president of the Reid Newfoundland Company he built the railway from Whitbourne to Port aux Basques. The contract specified he work the line for ten years. In return he received a large grant of land. In 1898, he further contracted to work all the railways in Newfoundland for fifty years on condition that at the end of this time they should become his property. This bargain, which included other matters such as steamers, docks and telegraphs, was extraordinarily favourable to Reid, who, by further enormous grants of land, became one of the largest landed proprietors in the world. Public opinion was aroused against the deal, and at first the governor, Herbert Murray, refused to ratify it. After the premier, James Spearman Winter, had been replaced by Robert Bond, the terms of the contract were revised, being made more favourable to Newfoundland, and Reid's interests were transferred to a company, the Reid Newfoundland Company, of which he was the first president. The Reid Newfoundland Company owned and operated the Whitbourne to Port aux Basques railway for 33 years and also ran the coastal boat and telegraph services on the island. Reid was knighted in 1907. Legacy There is a $3,500 Robert Gillespie Reid Memorial Scholarship available for Memorial University of Newfoundland.

Slacklining is similar to slack rope walking and tightrope walking. Slacklines differ from tightwires and tightropes in the type of material used and the amount of tension applied during use. Slacklines are tensioned significantly less than tightropes or tightwires in order to create a dynamic line which will stretch and bounce like a long and narrow trampoline. Tension can be adjusted to suit the user, and different webbing may be used in various circumstances. Styles of slacklining Slacklining on a beach =Urbanlining= Urbanlining or urban slacklining combines all the different styles of slacklining. It is practiced in urban areas, for example in city parks and on the streets. Most urban slackliners prefer wide lines for tricklining on the streets, but some may use narrow () lines for longline purposes or for waterlining. Also see the other sections of slackline styles below. One type of urbanlining is timelining, where one tries to stay on a slackline for as long as possible without falling down. This takes tremendous concentration and focus of will, and is a great endurance training for postural muscles. Slackline handstand Another type of urbanlining is streetlining, which combines street workout power moves with the slackline's dynamic, shaky, bouncy feeling. The main focus are static handstands, super splits‚Äîhands and feet together, planche, front lever, back lever, one arm handstand and other interesting extreme moves that are evolving in street workout culture. =Tricklining= Tricklining has become the most common form of slacklining because of the easy setup of slackline kits. Tricklining is often done low to the ground but can be done on highlines as well. A great number of tricks can be done on the line, and because the sport is fairly new, there is plenty of room for new tricks. Some of the basic tricks done today are walking, walking backwards, turns, drop knee, running and jumping onto the slackline to start walking, and bounce walking. Some intermediate tricks include: Buddha sit, sitting down, lying down, cross-legged knee drop, surfing forward, surfing sideways, and jump turns, or \\"180s\\". Some of the advanced tricks are: jumps, tree plants, jumping from line-to-line, 360s, butt bounces, and chest bounces. With advancements in webbing technology & tensioning systems, the limits for what can be done on a slackline are being pushed constantly. It is not uncommon to see expert slackliners incorporating flips and twists into slackline trick combinations. =Highlining= Man highlining at Taft Point in Yosemite National Park with El Capitan in the background. Highlining is slacklining at elevation above the ground or water. Many slackliners consider highlining to be the pinnacle of the sport. Highlines are commonly set up in locations that have been used or are still used for Tyrolean traverse. When rigging highlines, experienced slackers take measures to ensure that solid, redundant and equalized anchors are used to secure the line into position. Modern highline rigging typically entails a mainline of webbing, backup webbing, and either climbing rope or amsteel rope for redundancy. However, many highlines are rigged with a mainline and backup only, especially if the highline is low tension (less than ), or rigged with high quality webbing like Type 18Type 18 or MKII Spider Silk.MKII Spider Silk It is also common to pad all areas of the rigging which might come in contact with abrasive surfaces. To ensure safety, most highliners wear a climbing harness or swami belt with a leash attached to the slackline itself. Leash- less, or \\"free-solo\\" slacklining ‚Äì a term loosely taken from rockclimbing (\\"free\\" refers to free of aid equipment vs free from the slackline) ‚Äì is not unheard of, however, with proponents such as Dean Potter and Andy Lewis. =Slackline yoga= Slackline yoga takes traditional yoga poses and moves them to the slackline. It has been described as \\"distilling the art of yogic concentration\\". To balance on a piece of webbing lightly tensioned between two trees is not easy, and doing yoga poses on it is even more challenging. The practice simultaneously develops focus, dynamic balance, power, breath, core integration, flexibility, and confidence. Using standing postures, sitting postures, arm balances, kneeling postures, inversions and unique vinyasa, a skilled slackline yogi is able to create a flowing yoga practice without ever falling from the line. Split on a slackline Slackline yoga has been covered in The Wall Street Journal, Yoga Journal and Climbing Magazine. =Rodeo lines= Rodeo slacklining is the art and practice of cultivating balance on a piece of rope or webbing draped slack between two anchor points, typically about apart and off the ground in the center. This type of very \\"slack\\" slackline provides a wide array of opportunities for both swinging and static maneuvers. A rodeo line has no tension in it, while both traditional slacklines and tightropes are tensioned. This slackness in the rope or webbing allows it to swing at large amplitudes and adds a different dynamic. This form of slacklining first came into popularity in 1999, through a group of students from Colby College in Waterville, Maine. It was first written about on a website called the \\"Vultures Peak Center for Freestyle and Rodeo Slackline Research\\" in 2004. The article \\"Old Revolution‚ÄîNew Recognition - 3-10-04\\" describes these early developments in detail. History While rope walking has been around in one manner or another for thousands of years, the origins of modern-day slacklining is generally attributed to a rock climber named Adam Grosowsky from southern Illinois in 1979 when he was sixteen.\\"Above the Lawn, Walking the Line\\". New York Times; Sept. 8, 2006 https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/08/travel/escapes/08slack.html In 2012 a slackline performance by Andy Lewis was featured as part of the half time show by Madonna. It got attention during the 2016 Rio Olympics when slackliner Giovanna Petrucci performed on the beach at Ipanema, attracting the attention of the New York Times. A professional slackliner was credited with climbing a ski lift tower in Colorado and shimmying across a cable to save a man caught by a ski lift in January 2017.http://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/man- dangling-by-neck-from-ski-lift-saved-by-professional-slackliner/ =Highlining history= Highlining was inspired by highwire artists. The first successful highline walk is credited to 20-year-old Scott Balcom and 17-year-old Chris Carpenter who performed the first documented walk on nylon webbing highline. This highline, now referred to as 'The Arches' was approximately long and high located in Pasadena, California.Alpinist, Issue 21, Autumn 2007, \\"The Space Between, a history of funambulism\\" by Dean PotterWalk the Line: The Art of Balance and the Craft of Slackline, by Scott Balcom 2005 On July 13, 1985, Scott Balcom successfully crossed the Lost Arrow Spire highline. In 1995, Darrin Carter performed unprotected crossings of the Lost Arrow Spire in Yosemite and The Fins, in Tucson, AZ on Mt. Lemmon highway. On July 16, 2007, Libby Sauter became the first woman to successfully cross the Lost Arrow Spire,YouTube: First Woman Walks the Lost Arrow Spire Highline. In 2008, Dean Potter became the first person to BASE jump from a highline at Hell Roaring Canyon in Utah. World records =Longest highline= The record was set on July 27, 2019, by Mia Noblet of British Columbia and Lukas Irmler of Germany. Both crossed a slackline suspended more than above the open-pit Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec, during Slackfest, a slackline and highline festival. Noblet completed her crossing in 58 minutes. =Longest free solo highline= The longest free solo highline was walked at the Verdon Gorge in Southern France. At a length of 110m and height of 200m, it was walked by German Slackliner Friedi K√ºhne.https://www.bergsteigen.com/news/neuigkeiten/muenchner-profi-slackliner- bricht-eigenen-free-solo-highline-weltrekord/ The longest free solo highline by a female is held by Faith Dickey, who walked a 28-meter-long highline in Ostrov, Czech Republic in August 2012. The line was 25 meters high. =Highest slackline= The highest slackline on record was walked by Christian Schou on August 3, 2006 at Kjerag in Rogaland, Norway. The slackline was high. The project was repeated by Aleksander Mork in September 2007.http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/74401-highest- slackline-walk The current world record for the highest urban highline is held by Friedi K√ºhne, Mia Noblet, Gennady Skripko, Vladimir Murzaev, Maksim Kagin, Alexander Gribanov, and Nathan Paulin. All seven athletes managed to walk a 220m long, 350m high slackline between Oko Tower and Neva Tower 2 in Moscow, on September 7. =Longest slackline (longline)= The longest slackline walked by a woman, with a length of , was walked in September 2014 in Lausanne (CH) by Laetitia Gonnon = Longest blindfolded slackline walk = On 28 April 2019 in Kislovodsk, Russia, Friedi K√ºhne and Lukas Irmler from Germany walked a 975m long, 200m high slackline entirely with their eyes closed, ensuring this with a blindfold strapped over their eyes. Thus they broke the world record for the longest blindfolded slackline walk.

HKGolden has become an Internet community. The forum is a part of HKGolden.com, a computer information portal named after the Golden Computer Centre ‚Äì a shopping centre of computer products in Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, Hong Kong. Since 2006, it has become a popular and general platform for all Hong Kong netizen. It was the concentration platform of funny and satirical derivative works. However, due to the poor management of the administrators, many users have left in 2016. Access to the website is blocked to users in the Chinese Mainland by the Great Firewall of China. History  In the late 1990s, due to the popularity of the Internet, competition drove stores online. In an effort to protect consumers, the traders' association of the Golden Computer Centre launched the website with information about computer hardware and software prices, thus increasing the transparency of the marketplace. In the early 2000s, a discussion forum was launched to complement the website. It was originally open in structure and without topic demarcation, and destined for computing matters. Very soon, its topics became broader-based, the discussion area segregated into \\"computing\\" and \\"chill\\" areas, each with their own topics or \\"stations\\". On-line discussion groups formed. The community, formed by ordinary citizens as well as computer geeks, would be interested in all manner of local topics. In the course of discussions, slang would be widely employed. Neologisms would often develop, and these would quickly pass virally into colloquial usage. Users are being called \\"Son of Golden\\" (È´òÁôª‰ªî), and the users call the other users \\"brothers\\" (Â∑¥Êâì) and \\"sisters\\" (Áµ≤Êâì). Topics are themed by hobby groups, and include 'Movies', 'Photography', 'Motoring', 'Music', 'Finance', 'Sport', 'Political' , etc. Although the name \\"Hong Kong Golden Forum\\" applies to the whole, this name is now usually synonymous with the \\"Off-topic station\\" within the forum due to its runaway popularity. At one time, forum members formed themselves into registered cliques, the most prominent ones being \\"Big mouth\\" and \\"DIY\\". HKGolden has become an influential media from which topics and exclusive news are frequently being reported on magazine and newspaper. Many people believe that reporters, police and even government may be active in the forum to investigate popular culture and public opinion. In 2003, the website was sold to Fevaworks by the owner. In July 2003, the database was severely corrupted following a hacking incident, and the website had to be closed for maintenance until 25 August of that year, when the forum was once again re-opened. Since the incident, a number of changes were instigated: *membership category simplified to 2 types ‚Äì \\"ordinary\\" and \\"premium\\" *ordinary members are allowed to create only 5 threads per day; no limit for premium members *in exchange for extra privileges, premium members have to submit proofs of identity and address *dismantling of the registered cliques *membership is now free The forum still repeatedly suffers from hacking; the last provoked stoppage occurred on 8 September 2006. On 2009, the forum leaked a six-minute detailed video involving teenage prostitution on a double-decker bus for HK$200 to raise money for designer handbag. This led to local police launching a criminal investigation. In Hong Kong, it was reported that HKGolden was the most visited place for technology brand related discussions with 87,291 posts in a single discussion channel within three months.

In Melbourne, he developed Malvern Star bicycles into a household name in Australia, then retired to the Gold Coast, Queensland, where he developed property, and as Mayor of the Gold Coast, promoted the area to Australia and the world as a family friendly holiday destination through the bikini-clad meter maids in Surfers Paradise. Background Bruce Small was born in Ryde, New South Wales, in 1895. At the age of 24 in 1920 he bought an interest in the Malvern Star shop at 185 Glenferrie Rd, in the Melbourne suburb of Malvern, from Austral Wheel Race winner, Tom Finnigan. His brothers, Frank and Ralph Small, joined Bruce in his sales, building cycles at the rate of 5 per week. The small cycle shop offered prizes in cycle races, resulting in Hubert Opperman winning a prize in 1921, and impressing Small so much that a job was offered to the young cyclist. Thus started a long relationship, as both friend and sponsor of Hubert Opperman. With the Second World War affecting parts supply, Malvern Star bicycles started manufacturing many of its own parts for bicycles. Defence contracts help the growth of the business. At its peak after the Second World War, Malvern Star had 115 stores with 1,000 dealers. After the war, Small's Malvern Star bicycles were ridden by Sid Patterson, who won the World Championship Sprint in Copenhagen in 1949, and several other races including amateur World Championship Pursuit in Liege (1950), professional World Championship Pursuit in Paris (1952), and professional World Championship Pursuit in Zurich (1953). At the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Ian Browne and Tony Marchant won the gold medal in the Tandem on a Malvern Star. Property development From 1945 Bruce Small owned land at Gowanbrae and promoted property development in Strathmore Heights, in Melbourne. In 1956 he bought 40 hectares of flood-prone mangrove land on the Nerang River, on the Gold Coast. He retired from his Malvern Star business in 1958. From 1958 to the mid-1960s, he pioneered canal developments based on 'proven U.S. methods' from the U.S. state of Florida. Bruce Small was also the brainchild behind the development of 100 private \\"own your own\\" flats Edgewater Towers, St Kilda, Victoria which at 13 storeys was the tallest residential apartment building in Victoria at the time it opened 4 March 1961. Bruce Small's long-term friend Sir Hubert Opperman lived in the building from the time it opened until his move to a retirement village in 1985. Gold Coast Mayor and politician In 1967, with the slogan \\"Think Big, Vote Small\\", he was elected Mayor of the Gold Coast, holding office till 1973. He was re-elected from 1976 to 1978. Like many politicians during this period, a time prior to the existence of conflict of interest laws, he saw no conflict between his duties as Mayor and his opportunities as a property developer. After a season of cyclonic storms which battered the Gold Coast in 1967, Small was instrumental in promoting this area as a family holiday destination through widespread appearances and promotions of the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, established in 1965, to attract tourists back to the area. From 1972 to 1977 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Queensland representing the seat of Surfers Paradise for the Country Party (later renamed the National Party of Australia). He was knighted in 1974 for his services to the Gold Coast and Queensland. The Gold Coast City Council has named the Sir Bruce Small Park in Benowa, and Sir Bruce Small Boulevard after him.

Born in Manhattan, Townsend became interested in composition while a student at the Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, in New York City. He taught himself composition, counterpoint and orchestration. In 1941, he began studying composition privately, with Tibor Serly, Stefan Wolpe, Aaron Copland, Otto Luening and Felix Greissle, among others. Townsend taught at Brooklyn College, CUNY (1958‚Äì69), Lehman College, CUNY (1970‚Äì71), the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut; 1973‚Äì5) and Purchase College (also known as SUNY Purchase) (1973‚Äì6). From 1977 to 1980, he was editor of Musical Heritage Review. Townsend‚Äôs research into 18th- and 19th-century music has resulted in editions, recordings and performances, most notably of a Carl Czerny overture and a mass by Sigismund Neukomm. He received research grants from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund (1965) and the New York State Council on the Arts (1975).Lance W. Brunner. The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, edited by Stanley Sadie (1992). and Townsend‚Äôs compositions include several orchestral works, chamber music pieces, choral works, film and television scores, three operettas, and one opera. While still a high school student, he won a nationwide contest for student composers; Bernard Herrmann led the CBS Symphony Orchestra in a radio broadcast performance of the winning composition, Contra Dances. Seven years later, Townsend achieved public notice as a composer when pianist Ray Lev performed the premiere of his Sonatina No. 1 at Carnegie Hall. Townsend's own compositions generally used traditional forms and tonality. Townsend was married twice. His first marriage was to Anne-Marie Findley, and produced three children, Jonathan, Adam, and April. His second wife, Jean, survived him, as do his children from his first marriage.

The Massachusetts Circular Letter was a statement written by Samuel Adams and James Otis Jr., and passed by the Massachusetts House of Representatives (as constituted in the government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, not the current constitution) in February 1768 in response to the Townshend Acts. Reactions to the letter brought heightened tensions between the British Parliament and Massachusetts, and resulted in the military occupation of Boston by the British Army, which contributed to the coming of the American Revolution. Background After the Stamp Act was repealed in 1766,Gordon S. Wood, The American Revolution: A History (New York: Modern Library, 2002), 30. the British Parliament imposed the Townshend Acts in 1767 as another way of generating revenue. The acts placed an import duty on glass, paint, paper, lead, and tea as well as establishing an American Board of Customs.Joseph C. Morton, The American Revolution (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2003), 24. In response, the Massachusetts General Court issued a circular letter. (A circular letter, also known as a circular, is a letter meant to be widely distributed, or \\"circulated\\".) The Massachusetts Circular Letter was sent to the representative bodies of the other colonies. Massachusetts received positive responses from New Jersey, Connecticut, and the Virginia House of Burgesses.Robert Middlekauff, The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789 (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), 161. The letter In the Circular Letter, Samuel Adams argued that the Townshend Acts were unconstitutional because the colony of Massachusetts was not represented in Parliament. Adams maintained that Parliament's status as the supreme legislative body of the British Empire did not permit it to violate the British Constitution and the natural rights of the colonists. Adams made it clear that he was not advocating colonial representation in Parliament: because the American Colonies were \\"separated by an ocean of a thousand leagues\\" from Great Britain, he thought it was impractical for them to be properly represented in Parliament.Middlekauff, Glorious Cause, 160. Instead, Adams argued in favor of the previous arrangement, where the colonies were taxed only by their own provincial assemblies in which they were already represented. Consequences After the Circular Letter had been passed and issued to other colonies, Lord Hillsborough, Secretary of State for the Colonies, ordered the Massachusetts General Court to revoke it. The body voted 92-17 not to do so. In response to the General Court's defiance, Governor Francis Bernard dissolved the assembly. This led to an outbreak of mob violence from colonists who no longer had any legal way to deal with their grievances. They attacked customs officials, making it impossible for them to perform their duties. In response to the deteriorating situation, Lord Hillsborough sent four regiments of British soldiers to Boston. Arriving in October 1768, the soldiers only increased the tensions, as recorded in the anonymously penned \\"Journal of Occurrences\\", which chronicled the occupation. These tensions culminated on March 5, 1770 with the Boston Massacre.Wood, American Revolution, 33-34.

(15 August 1607 ‚Äì 15 January 1648) was a Spanish Dominican friar who went as a missionary to Asia. He died in China as a martyr. He was canonized by Pope John Paul II on 1 October 2000, as one of the 120 Martyrs of China. Capillas is honored by the Holy See as the protomartyr among the missionaries in China, and is considered the glory and pride of the Dominican Order. Biography De Capillas was born in Baquer√≠n de Campos, Palencia, Spain, on 14 August 1607. At the age of 17 he entered the Order of Preachers, receiving the religious habit in the Dominican Priory of St. Paul in Valladolid. While still a deacon he was sent by his Order to do missionary work in the Philippines, landing in Manila during February 1631. Shortly after his arrival he was ordained as a priest.Dominicans of Singapore \\"St. Francis de Capillas\\" De Capillas remained there for the next decade, working alongside his fellow friars. His own field of labor was the district of Tuao, Cagayan Valley, on the island of Luzon, where many converted. De Capillas considered that time spent in the Philippines as a period of preparation for a mission to China. At the Provincial Chapter held by the friars of the Order in Manila in 1641, he was given permission to transfer to the Order's mission there, soon transferring to that island, along with a friend, Friar Francisco D√≠ez, O.P. He was one of the last Spanish missionaries in Taiwan before they were ousted from the island by the Dutch later that same year.Saint Francisco Fernandez de Capillas, Protomartyr of China, January 15 The two friars arrived in the Province of Fujian, on mainland China, in March 1642, where they joined a fellow Dominican who had survived an earlier period of persecution.Dominicans of Singapore They then engaged in evangelization among the Chinese people of the region, especially in the cities of Fu'an, Fogan and Ting-Moyang Ten. They were so successful that they were able to establish a community of the Third Order of Saint Dominic. On 4 November 1644, there was a huge change of fortune for the mission. That day, his friend Fr. Francisco Diez died of natural causes. Later the same day, the Manchurians invaded the city of Fuan, where the missionaries were based, in their conquest of the Ming Dynasty. The new dynasty was hostile to Christianity and immediately began to persecute the Christians.Vatican News Service On 13 November 1647, De Capillas was captured while returning from Fogan, where he had gone to administer the sacraments to a sick person. Enduring many insults, he was taken to the worst local prison, where he suffered the torture of having his ankles crushed while being dragged. He was scourged, repeatedly bloodied, but he endured the tortures without cries of pain, so that judges and torturers were surprised at the end. He was moved, almost dying, to a prison where they locked up those criminals condemned to death.Dominicans of Singapore His conduct was uplifting, and aroused the admiration of others sentenced to death and even the prison guards themselves, who allowed food to be brought to him, that he not die of hunger. While in prison, he wrote On 15 January 1648 De Capillas was sentenced to death on charges of disseminating false doctrines and inciting the people against new Emperor. His death sentence, by decapitation, was carried out at Fogan the same day. He thus became the first martyr within the vast Chinese empire. Veneration De Capillas was beatified by Pope Pius X, 2 May 1909, along with 14 Chinese laypeople who had also died as martyrs. He was canonized as part of a group of 120 martyrs of China on 1 October 2000, by Pope John Paul II. Their collective memory is on remembered 9 July, while the feast day of St. Francis Fern√°ndez de Capillas observed on 15 January. He is considered a protomartyr by the Holy See.

The Council resides in the Fremont, Seattle, Washington, but its members are from throughout the city. The FAC believes that art establishes a bond between people. When people feel connected to their community, the community thrives. It serves the needs of local artists and community members by fostering a cooperative, collaborative environment for the creation and celebration of art. There are three distinct areas of public programming: events, art and workshops. In turn, the community supports the FAC through partnerships with government, local businesses, and schools. It is an established and integral part of the neighborhood's business community and has healthy relationships with the Fremont Chamber of Commerce, Fremont Rotary Club, the local Seattle Public Schools and the Fremont Sunday Market. History The Fremont Arts Council was founded in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, in 1979 with the belief that art establishes a bond between people and their neighborhood. Events The Fremont Arts Council sponsors several annual events including the Summer Solstice Parade and Pageant, May Day, Troll-a-ween, and the Winter Solstice Feast. =Fremont Solstice Parade= The FAC's signature event is the annual Fremont Summer Solstice Parade & Pageant, which has grown over 25 years to become one of the premier outlets for public artistic expression in Seattle. The Solstice Parade is an outpouring of creativity and community during which hundreds of volunteers and tens of thousands of spectators transform the streets of Fremont into a roving theater.

Anyone in the community is invited to the classes, the workshops, and the event itself. Workshops and classes usually require a small fee. =Troll-O- Ween= =Feast of the Winter Solstice= Public Art FAC has been responsible for the installation and maintenance of several public artworks in the Fremont area. These include the Fremont Troll and Waiting for the Interurban. =Fremont Troll= One of Seattle's most popular public artworks, the Fremont Troll, is a mixed-media megalithic statue, located on N. 36th Street at Troll Avenue N., under the north end of the Aurora Bridge. (Troll Avenue was renamed in its honor in 2005.) It is clutching an actual original Volkswagen Beetle, as if it had just swiped it from the roadway above. Somewhat amusingly, in light of Seattle P‚ÄìI columnist Emmett Watson's periodic promotion of the KBO, the vehicle had a California license plate. The piece was commissioned by the Fremont Arts Council in 1989, and built in 1990. The Troll was sculpted by four local artists: Steve Badanes, Will Martin, Donna Walter and Ross Whitehead. The Troll is interactive--visitors are encouraged to clamber on him or try to poke out his one good eye (a hubcap). The Troll is high, weighs two tons, and is made of steel rebar, wire and ferroconcrete. =Waiting for the Interurban= \\"Waiting for the Interurban\\" is a 1979 cast aluminum sculpture collection in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. It is located on the south side of N. 34th Street, just east of the northern end of the Fremont Bridge. It consists of six people, to say nothing of the dog, standing under a shelter and waiting for public transportation‚Äîspecifically, the Seattle-Everett Interurban. (In actuality, the six figures would have waited for a very long time, as the Interurban ran on Fremont Avenue and never turned east on 34th.) The sculptor, local resident Richard Beyer, included several subtleties in the sculpture which reward close viewing. There is also some gentle needling of a local Fremont political leader and pioneer in municipal recycling, Armen Napoleon Stepanian. People living and working in the Fremont neighborhood often dress the characters with apparel appropriate to the season (termed \\"art attacks\\" by some) to the extent that, when those unfamiliar with the sculpture drive by, it is not always immediately obvious as they pass that the characters waiting are actually statues. The most imaginative displays are memorialized at History House. The sculpture is a few blocks west of Troll Avenue N., the location of the Fremont Troll. =BF Day School tile project= =Seating along the Fremont Canal= =Space Project= Community Outreach The FAC regularly schedules events with local and international professional artists who give lectures and teach workshops to the community. In the past five years, the FAC has hosted artists from England, carnival experts from Trinidad, a performer and costume maker from Liberia and a sculptor from New York City. These artists have furthered the technical skills of the community and have significantly improved the quality of art the FAC produces. The FAC understands that involving local and international artists is invaluable in inspiring and empowering the community.

Alternatively, the family may be sunk into a very broadly defined family Cyatheaceae sensu lato as the subfamily Dicksonioideae. Most of the genera in the family are terrestrial ferns or have very short trunks compared to tree ferns of the family Cyatheaceae sensu stricto. However, some of the larger species can reach several metres in height. A number of others are epiphytes. They are found mostly in tropical regions in the Southern Hemisphere, as far south as southern New Zealand. Larger tree ferns in the genus Cibotium were formerly included in Dicksoniaceae, but are now segregated as the family Cibotiaceae. Description Species in the family are generally characterized by large pinnate fronds, 1‚Äì4 m long. The family includes several species of tree ferns, which grow a single trunk, notably the species in Dicksonia. All members of the family have long, tapering hairs composed of cells arranged end to end, unlike the scales characteristic of the Cyatheaceae s.l.

Historically part of Dumfriesshire, its public buildings include Annan Academy, of which the writer Thomas Carlyle was a pupil, and a Georgian building now known as \\"Bridge House\\". The Town Hall was built in Victorian style in 1878, using the local sandstone. Annan also features a Historic Resources Centre. In Port Street, some of the windows remain blocked up to avoid paying the window tax. Each year on the first Saturday in July, Annan celebrates the Royal Charter and the boundaries of the Royal Burgh are confirmed when a mounted cavalcade undertakes the Riding of the Marches. Entertainment includes a procession, sports, field displays and massed pipe bands. Geography Annan stands on the River Annan‚Äîfrom which it is named‚Äînearly from its mouth, accessible to vessels of 60 tons as far as Annan Bridge and 300 tons within of the town. It is from Dumfries by rail, in the region of Dumfries and Galloway on the Solway Firth in the south of Scotland. Eastriggs is about to the east and Gretna is about to the east. History Roman remains exist nearby. The Mote of Annan formed the original home of the de Brus family, later known as the Bruces, lords of Annandale, which most famously produced Robert the Bruce. It was at the Battle of Annan in December 1332 that Bruce supporters overwhelmed Balliol's forces to bring about the end of the first invasion of Scotland in the Second War of Scottish Independence. The Balliols and the Douglases were also more or less closely associated with Annan. Annan Castle once stood in the old churchyard and was originally the church tower. The Battle of Bruce's Acres was fought near Newbie Castle against the English in the 13th century. Bruce's Well is a natural spring that lies on the edge of the River Annan just downstream of the Gala Burn and Glen. It is associated with Robert the Bruce as recorded by Historic Environment Scotland.*Bruce's Well During the period of the Border lawlessness the inhabitants suffered repeatedly at the hands of moss-troopers and through the feuds of rival families, in addition to the losses caused by the Scottish Wars of Independence. During his retreat from Derby, Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed in the High Street at the inn where Back to the Buck now stands. With the river embanked, Annan served as a maritime town whose shipyards built many clippers and other boats. A cairn on the jetty commemorates Robert Burns, who worked as an exciseman here in the 1790s. Although the port is now mainly dry, a few stranded boats remain. Annan Academy has a history that goes back to the 17th century and alumni including Thomas Carlyle. Its current campus on St John's Road primarily dates to the 1960s. After the Acts of Union 1707, Annan, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben and Sanquhar formed the Dumfries district of burghs, returning one member between them to the House of Commons of Great Britain. Annan previously formed a constituency of the Parliament of Scotland and the Convention of Estates. In 1871, the Dumfries Burghs had a population of 3,172 and the royal burgh of Annan had 4,174, governed by a provost and 14 councillors. A Harbour Trust was established in 1897 to improve the port. The small Newbie Harbour lay on the other side of the River Annan near Newbie Mill and served the old Newbie Castle and barony. By 1901, the population was 5,805, living principally in red sandstone buildings. The railway turntable was designed and developed in Annan; it can be seen today at the National Railway Museum, York. Landmarks Just outside the town, the Chapelcross nuclear power station has now shut down and is being decommissioned. The four cooling towers were demolished in 2007. Nearby, John Maxwell, 4th Lord Herries, built Hoddom Castle (‚Äì1565). To the east of the town lies the settlement of Watchill and the similarly named Watchhall.

Added to in 1904 by Charles Walker of Newcastle as the gift of the parish priest the Rev Canon Lord Archibald Douglas. There is also a local interchurch group, known as Annandale Churches Together.. Economy In the 19th century, Annan was connected to the Glasgow & Southwestern Railway, the Caledonian Railway, and the Solway Junction Railway. It exported cured hams, cattle, sheep, and grain to England; it also produced cotton goods, ropes, ships, and salmon. By the First World War, it was also a center of bacon-curing, distilling, tanning, sandstone quarrying, and nursery-gardening. Transportation Annan Bridge, a stone bridge of three arches, built between 1824 and 1827, carries road traffic over the River Annan. It was designed by Robert Stevenson and built by John Lowry. There is also a railway bridge and a nearby pedestrian bridge over the Annan. It is still served by the Annan railway station, the old Solway Junction Railway station Annan Shawhill having closed to passengers in 1931 and freight in 1955.

In Game Six of that series, Sundberg scored the dramatic ninth inning winning run by sliding into home plate, skillfully avoiding the tag of St. Louis Cardinals catcher Darrell Porter. Sundberg reached base when he laid down a bunt that resulted in a force out at third.1985 World Series Game 6 box score at Baseball Reference In 1986, Sundberg helped the Royals pitching staff lead the league in earned run average, however they fell to third place in the American League's Western Division. Sundberg was traded to the Chicago Cubs in 1987, before signing back with Texas where, at the age of 38 he ended his career at the end of the 1989 season. Career statistics In a sixteen-year major league career, Sundberg played in 1,962 games, accumulating 1,493 hits in 6,021 at bats for a .248 career batting average along with 95 home runs, 624 runs batted in and an on- base percentage of .327. His .993 career fielding average was 8 points higher than the league average over the span of his playing career. Sundberg led American League catchers six times in fielding percentage, putouts and assists.2001 Fielding Leaders, Baseball Digest, July 2001, Vol. 60, No. 7, He completed 145 double plays in 1,962 games in his career, and holds the major league record for the best ratio of double plays to errors of any catcher in major league history behind the plate for at least 1,000 games.For Catchers, The Name of the Game is Defense, Baseball Digest, May 2005, Vol. 64, No. 3, Sundberg still holds the American League record for games caught in one season with 155 in 1975. Sundberg was the first catcher to win six American League Gold Gloves, although Bob Boone won five in the American League and two more in the National League. His 1976 Gold Glove was the first by any Rangers player. He caught 130 shutouts in his career, ranking him fifth all-time among catchers. Sundberg played more games as a catcher than any other player in Rangers history (1,512).Most Games Caught for Team at The Encyclopedia of Catchers At the time of his retirement, Sundberg had caught more major league games than any man in history except his contemporary Bob Boone.

The princely branch of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda, with its family seats in Rheda and Hohenlimburg, is one of the two extant lines of the princely House of Bentheim, besides the Princes of Bentheim-Steinfurt who still own the castles of Bentheim and Steinfurt.  History  Bentheim- Tecklenburg-Rheda emerged as a partition of Bentheim-Steinfurt-Tecklenburg- Limburg in 1606, when the older county of Bentheim-Tecklenburg was partitioned off again, after the death of Arnold III, Count of Bentheim-Steinfurt- Tecklenburg-Limburg (1554-1606). The territories of the ruling counts of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Limburg and Rheda then consisted of the counties of Tecklenburg and Limburg and the lordship of Rheda, at times divided between family members again. In 1701, Brandenburgian troops occupied Tecklenburg, as there had been a dispute about the county with the counts of Solms-Braunfels since 1577, and the latter sold their rights to Brandenburg. After the loss of Tecklenburg, the Bentheim-Tecklenburg branch still ruled the county of Limburg and the lordship of Rheda, although about 100 kilometers apart from each other, while the Bentheim-Steinfurt branch continued to rule in Bentheim and Steinfurt. In 1756 the residence was moved from Hohenlimburg to Rheda, which remains the main seat of the family to this day. In 1803 the secularized monasteries of Herzebrock and Clarholz, both located within the territories, were taken over by the counts. However, their sovereignty ended with the mediatisation in 1808 when the county became part of the Grand Duchy of Berg, and after the Congress of Vienna (1815) of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1817, the count was created 1st Prince of Bentheim-Tecklenburg and Rheda by the Prussian king.Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, F√ºrstliche H√§user XIX. \\"Bentheim\\". C.A. Starke Verlag, 2011, pp. 116-119. (German). . In 1854 he received a hereditary seat in the Prussian House of Lords. The castles of Hohenlimburg and Rheda, Bosfeld House and the former abbeys of Herzebrock and Clarholz are still today owned by the House of Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda.

Beale was laid down on 19 December 1941 at Staten Island, N.Y., by the Bethlehem Steel Co.; launched on 24 August 1942; sponsored by Miss Nancy Beale, a great- grandniece of LT Beale; and commissioned on 23 December 1942 at the New York Navy Yard, Commander Joe B. Cochran in command.  World War II  =1943 = Early in January 1943, Beale began shakedown training off the coast of New England. Later that month, she continued that training in the West Indies near Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In mid-February, the destroyer returned north to New York for a month of post-shakedown repairs. She returned to sea on 15 March and headed back to the West Indies where she served as antisubmarine escort and plane guard for the recently commissioned aircraft carrier during her shakedown training near Trinidad. Beale completed another repair period at the New York Navy Yard between 10 and 21 March and then embarked upon the long voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Steaming by way of Norfolk, Virginia, she arrived at Crist√≥bal in the Panama Canal Zone on 22 April and transited the canal on the 28th. The warship paused briefly at Balboa at the Pacific terminus of the canal before heading north toward the California coast that same day. She made an overnight stop at San Diego on 5 and 6 May before arriving in San Francisco on the 7th. Five days later, Beale put to sea on her way to the Hawaiian Islands. She entered Pearl Harbor on 22 May and spent the next six weeks conducting antisubmarine warfare (ASW) and gunnery training in the local operating area. On 6 July, the destroyer departed Oahu on her way back to California. She arrived in San Diego on the 11th and remained there until the 19th when she put to sea to participate in amphibious exercises carried out near Monterey on the 21st. The following day, Beale steamed into San Francisco. After a week's stay, she passed out of the Golden Gate again on 29 July and charted a course to the Aleutian Islands. On 5 August, the destroyer entered Kuluk Bay at Adak. Her tour of duty with the North Pacific Force lasted almost four months, but the only enemy she encountered was the foul climate. In mid-August, Beale's guns joined in the bombardment preparatory to the amphibious assault on Kiska. When the troops landed, however, they discovered that the effort had been in vain. The Japanese had abandoned the island almost three weeks previously. For the remainder of her assignment in the Aleutians, the warship continued to struggle against the elements while carrying out patrol and escort missions. At the end of November, the destroyer departed Dutch Harbor and shaped a course south to Hawaii. She stood into Pearl Harbor about a week later but stayed only three days. When Beale resumed her voyage, she steered a course via Funafuti in the Ellice Islands and Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides to Milne Bay, New Guinea. She reached her destination on 18 December. Beale spent the next seven months supporting General Douglas MacArthur's conquest of the northern coast of New Guinea and consequent isolation of the large Japanese bases in the Bismarck Archipelago at Rabaul on New Britain and Kavieng on New Ireland. She wasted little time before getting into action. Just six days after her arrival, the destroyer was underway in company with an invasion force bound for Cape Gloucester on the western end of New Britain to secure the eastern flank of the vital Dampier Strait and Vitiaz Straits between that island and New Guinea. Her echelon, made up of seven tank landing ships (LSTs) escorted by three destroyers in addition to Beale, arrived off the objective early on the 26th, and the LSTs beached during the afternoon watch. At around 14:30, a large formation of enemy planes attacked the Allied force off Cape Gloucester. Beale escaped damage, and her gunners claimed a kill on an Aichi D3A-1 \\"Val\\" dive bomber. Her good luck, however, eluded several of her colleagues. suffered direct hits from two bombs that touched off a huge explosion, and she sank in less than 20 minutes with a loss of 108 crewmembers. , a battle-scarred veteran of Pearl Harbor, received new wounds when a hail of fragments from several near misses riddled her hull and superstructure and injured over 30 of her crew, four of them fatally. Near misses also caused damage and a few casualties on board . Later that same day while escorting LST-466 in the vicinity of Borgen Bay, Beale encountered a Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" twin engine medium bomber pursued by three Republic P-47 \\"Thunderbolt\\" fighters. Her gunners joined the fracas, and the \\"Betty\\" soon went into the sea about distant on her port bow. = 1944 = After that action, the destroyer retired to the vicinity of Buna Roads and Cape Sudest, on the eastern coast of New Guinea south of the Dampier and Vitiaz Straits, in which neighborhood she remained until the beginning of 1944. On New Year's Day 1944, Beale departed Buna and rendezvoused with an assault force composed of nine high speed transports (APDs), two tank landing ships (LSTs), and several large landing craft (LCIs) with the 126th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) of the U.S. Army's 32d Infantry Division embarked. Seven other destroyers joined Beale in the escort. The force steamed northwest through Vitiaz Strait to Saidor, New Guinea, where the soldiers streamed ashore unopposed on the morning of 2 January to secure the left flank of the straits through which General MacArthur's forces would pass constantly during their leapfrog up the back of the New Guinea hen. Beale and her compatriots in the screen contented themselves with antiair and antisubmarine patrols during the landings. Beale in February 1944. For the next month, the warship divided her time between support for the Saidor operation and general patrol and escort missions along the New Guinea coast from Milne Bay to Saidor. On 5 February, Beale stood out of Milne Bay and set course for Sydney, Australia, where she carried out repairs from 9 to 23 February. Returning to Milne Bay on 27 February, she reported for duty with Task Force 74 (TF 74), a mixed force made up of American and Australian cruisers screened by American destroyers and commanded by Rear Admiral Victor A. C. Crutchley, VC, RN. With both sides of the straits between New Guinea and New Britain free of Japanese interference, General MacArthur looked north to the Admiralty Islands whose capture would further shield his right flank during the advance and provide an alternative base to heavily defended Rabaul. Accordingly, on 27 February, Beale and her colleagues in TF 74 stood out to sea from Cape Sudest, New Guinea, just ahead of a task force composed of fast transports (APDs) and destroyers with elements of the Army's 1st Cavalry Division embarked. The troops were to serve either as the initial invasion force if resistance in the Admiralties was sufficiently light or as a reconnaissance in force to be withdrawn if opposition proved too heavy. Arriving off Los Negros Island about two hours into the morning watch of 29 February, Beale accompanied and to a station north of Seeadler Harbor off Ndrilo Island to provide gunfire support for the landing force. At 07:40, she and her consorts opened fire on the island and continued to pound suspected enemy positions for about 15 minutes. The landing force's initial successes obviated the need for a second drubbing of the targets scheduled for the beginning of the forenoon watch. With all apparently going well ashore, the warship cleared the area in company with the rest of the task force, less two destroyers that remained behind to provide call fire, and steamed back to Cape Sudest. On 4 March, she returned to the vicinity of the Admiralties with TF 74\\\\. After bombarding an enemy gun emplacement on Hauwei Island, her task force took up a patrol station about 30 miles (55 km) to the north of Manus. Beale remained on station with TF 74 for three days guarding the approaches to the Admiralty Islands while the troops ashore consolidated their hold on Los Negros Island and moved over to Manus. On the 7th, she made a visit to Hyane Harbor on Los Negros with Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey embarked and then bombarded an enemy position on Moakareng Peninsula before rejoining the task force for the voyage back to Cape Sudest. Following a week of gunnery drills and tactical exercises, Beale joined , , , and in an anti-shipping sweep along the northern coast of New Guinea that was highlighted by a bombardment of Japanese installations at Wewak on 19 March. She patrolled off Oro Bay, New Guinea, on the 20th before carrying out repairs there between 21 and 27 March. The destroyer conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and more gunnery drills during the period 29 March to 8 April and then began another availability on 9 April at Milne Bay, New Guinea, that occupied her until the middle of the month. Beale's return to combat came in mid-April during the three-pronged occupation of a portion of New Guinea's northern coast bounded by Tanamerah Bay in the west and Aitape in the east. The destroyer was assigned to Rear Admiral Russell S. Berkey's TF 75, built around light cruisers , , and and designated Covering Force \\"B\\" for the Hollandia mission. Her unit parted company with the main force about midnight on 21 April and reached its objective, Humboldt Bay, at about 05:00 on the 22d. At around 06:00 Beale and her consorts commenced a 15-minute preliminary bombardment. Those efforts, as well as the contributions added by TF 58 aircraft, prompted most of the supposed defenders to abandon their assignment and head for safer surroundings. As a consequence of the enemy's headlong flight, the assault troops enjoyed a landing that in amphibious circles might be regarded as a walkover, and Japanese resistance never really materialized. With the landing's success assured, Beale cleared the area with Task Group 77.2 (TG 77.2) and arrived in Seeadler Harbor, Manus, the next day. After taking on fuel and provisions, the destroyer returned to sea on 26 April bound for the northern coast of New Guinea to resume support for the occupation of the region around Hollandia. She took up patrol station off Humboldt Bay on the morning of 27 April and, for the next several days, alternated between patrol duty, shore bombardment missions, and screening assignments with the aircraft carriers also supporting the troops ashore. Early in May, the warship returned to Seeadler Harbor to prepare for the next hop in the leapfrog up the back of the New Guinea hen. Before embarking on that phase of the huge island's conquest, however, she joined and Bache to conduct a subsidiary mission in the vicinity of the bypassed Japanese base at Wewak where enemy shore batteries were hampering the work of Aitape-based PT boats. On 9 May, the three destroyers departed Manus for Aitape where, on the 11th, they embarked four PT boat officers to help them locate the targets. Beale and her colleagues carried out their bombardment on the 12th, returned the impromptu spotters to Aitape, and headed back to Manus. Beale reentered Seeadler Harbor in time to complete preparations for the Wakde-Sarmi step of the climb up the New Guinea ladder and sortie with the covering forces on 15 May. The destroyer and her colleagues took station off the objectives early on the morning of the 17th. After participating in the preinvasion bombardment, she and conducted a fruitless search for enemy barges reported to be in the vicinity of Sarmi. At the conclusion of that mission, Beale shaped a course for Humboldt Bay, where she arrived on the 18th. She returned to the Wakde-Sarmi area on 21 May and patrolled to the north and west with TF 75 while the troops ashore consolidated their beachhead and prepared to move inland against a much more resolute defense than had been encountered at Hollandia. The fact that the defense was confined entirely to enemy ground forces allowed the Army to proceed on its own once the beachhead was fully secured and to release most of its naval support to participate in the next amphibious operation on the New Guinea timetable, the seizure of Biak, one of the Schouten Islands located just to the east of the peninsula that constitutes the head of the New Guinea bird. Accordingly, Beale left the Wakde-Sarmi area and arrived back in Humboldt Bay on 24 May to join the Biak assault force. The following day, she returned to sea with that force to carry out the mission. Arriving off Biak on the 27th, the destroyer provided antisubmarine protection for the cruisers during their prelanding bombardment. After the landing, she moved in to bring her own guns to bear on enemy positions to assist the troops' movement inland. Beale patrolled off Biak until the end of May guarding the assembled warships against the submarine threat and supplying occasional gunfire support. After the invasion, the Japanese reversed their decision to leave Biak to its own devices and launched Operation \\"Kon\\" to reinforce the island's garrison. Beale returned to Humboldt Bay with TF 75 on 31 May to fuel and provision in preparation for the expected onslaught. On 7 June, the destroyer sortied from Humboldt Bay with TF 75 and shaped a course back to Biak. The cruiser- destroyer force took up station to the northeast of the island early in the evening of the 8th. An American patrol plane spotted the Japanese surface force attempting to bring reinforcements to Biak at about 22:00, and Beale's force picked it up on radar about 80 minutes later. Not long thereafter, the enemy made visual contact on the Allied surface force, let go the barges they were towing to Biak, and launched torpedoes before retiring at high speed. The Allied lead destroyers, Beale among them, charged toward the retreating enemy at flank speed and began firing at extreme range in the hope of closing the distance by forcing the Japanese to maneuver to avoid their salvoes. The enemy destroyers returned the fire and even launched another torpedo attack. The only damage ‚Äì other than fragments from near misses ‚Äì sustained by either side in the running duel, however, came at about 02:10 on the 9th when suffered a direct hit from one of the salvoes from Destroyer Division 47 (DesDiv 47). The enemy destroyer slowed briefly but picked up speed again soon thereafter. About 15 minutes later just before 02:30, the Allied force broke off the stern chase in compliance with orders issued to protect its ships from attack by friendly aircraft. Task Force 75 rendezvoused with TF 74 later that morning, and then Beale headed for Manus in the Admiralty Islands, where she spent the period 10 to 28 June carrying out maintenance work and conducting combat training. On 29 June, the destroyer stood out of Seeadler Harbor on her way to participate in the last two major amphibious operations of the New Guinea campaign. Before invading the Vogelkop peninsula proper on its northwestern coast at Cape Sansapor, General MacArthur concluded that his forces needed airfields farther west than those the Allies already possessed, and the island of Noemfoor, though relatively well defended, met his requirements perfectly. Beale and her colleagues in the cruiser-destroyer force arrived off the invasion beaches at Kamiri on Noemfoor's northwestern coast early on the morning of 2 July, and they pummelled the objective with a preliminary bombardment that pounded the defenders into what historian Samuel Eliot Morison described as \\"...that desirable state known to pugilists as 'punch drunk'.\\" That happy result allowed the assault troops to storm ashore and capture all their initial objectives against a resistance that scarcely deserved the name. It also obviated the immediate need for Beale and her consorts to provide gunfire support for the troops' initial movement inland from the beaches. Accordingly, she headed for Humboldt Bay that same day and arrived there on the 3d. After maintenance and overhaul work at Hollandia and Manus she returned to the northern coast of New Guinea in mid-July to help defend the eastern flank of the Allied enclave at Hollandia against pressure from the bypassed enemy garrison at Wewak. Her part in that endeavor consisted of patrols along the coast to interdict Japanese barge and truck traffic carrying reinforcements and supplies to their forces trying to breach the Aitape roadblock and contest Allied possession of the Hollandia region. Training exercises and further patrols along New Guinea's northern coast occupied Beale's time until the end of the month when she helped cover the unopposed landing at Cape Sansapor on the Vogelkop peninsula, the last rung on the New Guinea ladder. At the beginning of August, she left New Guinea for a voyage to Australia and spent the period, 11 to 25 August, receiving major maintenance work at Sydney. Revitalized, the destroyer returned to the northern shores of New Guinea at the end of the month to resume patrols along stretches of the coast still held by isolated enemy forces and to prepare for the Allies' next move on the southwestern Pacific chessboard, the jump from the head of the New Guinea bird into the Molucca Islands at Morotai. Beale departed Humboldt Bay on 13 September and headed for the point near the Vogelkop where the warships covering the seizure came together for the approach. Reunited there with many of her colleagues from the long series of operations from the Bismarcks to the Vogelkop, the destroyer set off with them on the latest quest. The force arrived off Cape Gila on the southwestern coast of Morotai early on the morning of D-Day, 15 September, and the cruiser- destroyer force to which Beale belonged parted company with the main group to cross the strait between Morotai and Halmahera to bombard a Japanese strongpoint reported to be located at Galela. After pounding the target for more than an hour without reply, the destroyer accompanied her consorts back across the strait to provide gunfire support for the landing itself. Her guns, however, remained silent because an absent enemy allowed the assault troops to occupy the objective unmolested. Since her gunfire support proved unnecessary, Beale retired from Morotai and rendezvoused with TG 77.1 near Mios Woendi on the 16th. For almost a month, she occupied her time with training exercises in the vicinity of the Admiralty Islands, evolutions punctuated by repair periods in Seeadler Harbor at Manus. By 12 October, the destroyer was back at Humboldt Bay readying herself for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. On the 13th, Beale's Close Covering Group, TG 77.3, stood out of the bay in company with the Northern LST Group whose landings on Leyte near Tacloban at the head of San Pedro Bay it was to support. The warship and her colleagues escorted the Northern Attack Force into Leyte Gulf during the night of 19‚Äì20 October, and together they made their way toward the northwestern corner of the gulf. While the amphibious forces approached their stations and took up their positions, the battleships of the Fire Support Unit, North, subjected the target area to a withering barrage. At the conclusion of that overture, Beale and her compatriots in TG 77.3 moved in to play their supporting roles in the opening act of the performance. Her cruiser-destroyer force opened fire at about 09:00, and, about 30 minutes later when the assault craft started their runs toward shore, Beale and her mates shifted their attention inland. The destroyer remained \\"on call\\" in San Pedro Bay for four days to provide gunfire support for the troops ashore whenever they requested it. During that space of time, she fought to repel frequent enemy air raids. Those attacks exacted a toll from Beale's neighbors. On the 20th, a torpedo bomber scored a hit on that forced her return to the United States for repairs which occupied her for the remainder of the war. The next day, she fired upon a suicide plane but failed to prevent him from crashing . On the 22d, another kamikaze crossed her sights, but again her efforts to thwart him succeeded only partially. Though diverted from Beale, he struck LCI-105 in nearby waters. At that point, danger loomed from a different quarter. By midday on the 23d, vague fears of a surface threat to the amphibious units assembled in Leyte Gulf began to take more tangible form as contact reports from submarines and aircraft confirmed the approach of at least three separate Japanese naval forces. The following afternoon, Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid organized his warships in the gulf to bar entry to the enemy. Beale's unit headed south to await the forces of Vice Admiral Shoji Nishimura and Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima in Surigao Strait, the passage between Leyte and Dinagat Islands. Posted on the right flank forward of the battle line, she participated in the second torpedo attack by destroyers on Nishimura's advancing warships just before 03:30 in the morning of 25 October. Though her own torpedoes failed to score on the enemy, several of those from her colleagues achieved their purpose. One hit battleship and slowed her briefly while another delivered the coup de gr√¢ce to destroyer , damaged almost an hour earlier by DesRon 54 in the first destroyer torpedo attack. Beale and her consorts then retired to give the cruisers and battleships a clear field of fire. Once the left flank destroyers executed the third torpedo attack and cleared the area, the battle line and the cruisers completed the destruction so ably initiated by the destroyers. Of Nishimura's two battleships, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, only the cruiser and a destroyer, both heavily damaged, escaped that encounter. The cruiser, , did not last long for the Japanese sank her later in the day after she suffered further pounding from both surface gunfire and aerial attacks. Vice Admiral Shima's foray into Surigao Strait was a very desultory affair, and Beale and her colleagues, having already yielded the field to the heavy units after launching torpedoes at Nishimura's approach, never came in contact with the enemy's second, halfhearted attempt to force the strait. Upon confirming to his own satisfaction that Nishimura's force was effectively destroyed, Shima displayed surprising prudence for a Japanese commander by retreating with his own vastly inferior force. The magnitude of the American victory increased as word of the successes won in the actions fought farther north off Samar and off Cape Enga√±o filtered into the gulf during the few days that Beale remained there guarding the amphibious force against submarine and air attack. On 29 October, the destroyer embarked upon a voyage that soon brought even more joy to her crewmen when they learned that their destination was the United States. Steaming by way of Ulithi Atoll and Pearl Harbor, she ended her transpacific journey at Seattle, Washington, on 27 November. From there, the warship headed south to San Francisco, where she began an extended repair period. She completed those repairs on 17 January 1945 and departed San Francisco the next day, bound for San Diego and two weeks of post-overhaul refresher training. On the last of day January, Beale stood out of San Diego on her way to rejoin the Pacific Fleet in prosecuting the final stages of the war against Japan. = 1945 = USS Beale (DD-471) Plan view forward, taken at the Hunters Point Naval Drydocks, San Francisco, California, 13 January 1945. White outlines mark recent alterations to the ship. Beale arrived in Hawaii on 8 February and, the following day, commenced gunnery and antisubmarine warfare training in the local operating area. She remained so engaged for nearly a month and, as a consequence, missed out on the assault on Iwo Jima carried out on 19 February; but she put to sea for the western Pacific in plenty of time to be on hand for the invasion of Okinawa. The destroyer sailed from Pearl Harbor on 5 March and, after a voyage that took her back via Ulithi Atoll, arrived at Leyte once again on St. Patrick's Day 1945 to be incorporated into the fleet gathering there for the assault on the Ryukyu Islands. After 10 days of preparations, she stood out of Leyte Gulf on 27 March in the screen of a fast echelon of TF 55, the Southern Attack Force, and set a course for Okinawa. Beale and her companions caught up with the slower echelons of the task force along the way, and together they arrived off the objective early in the morning of 1 April ‚Äî Easter Sunday, April Fool's Day, and L-Day for Okinawa all rolled into one. Later that morning, 5th Fleet staged its own version of an Easter parade when the vast amphibious force there assembled landed soldiers of the XXIV Army Corps and Marines of the III Amphibious Corps on the island's western coast at beaches to either side of the mouth of the Bisha River. At that point, the destroyers in the screen received other assignments, and Beale joined TF 54, the Gunfire and Covering Force, to serve as a seaborne artillery battery for the Army and Marine Corps while they consolidated their beachheads and started their advance inland. Both the troops ashore and their brethren supporting them in the warships afloat marveled at the enemy's feeble responses to the initial assault. The relative ease of that first thrust, however, only masked the gathering storm; and the calm lasted but a few days. On shore, the soldiers began to run into stiffer opposition as the first week drew to a close; and, by the opening of the second week, so had the marines. The land campaign became a ponderous slugfest that dragged on until early July. At sea, the \\"Divine Wind\\" blew on the fleet surrounding Okinawa for the first time on 6 and 7 April. During that first of eight major aerial assaults that the Japanese launched upon the ships at Okinawa, Beale's guns contributed to the antiaircraft barrage with which those ships tried to defend themselves. In spite of that collective effort, some of the intruders succeeded in their missions. In one such instance on the afternoon of the 6th, her sister ship suffered crashes by four kamikazes in the space of an hour while on station some 10 miles (18 km) north of Zampa Misaki. Another sister, nearby , went to Newcomb's aid immediately while more distant Beale rushed to offer her help as well. When the fourth suicide plane to hit Newcomb slid across to Leutze's fantail before exploding, the damage he caused forced her to pull away from Newcomb's side and leave Beale to succor Newcomb alone. As a result of the prompt assistance Beale and Leutze rendered, Newcomb's crew quelled the raging inferno on board their ship within half an hour, and busy towed her into the anchorage at Kerama Retto the following day. After seeing Newcomb and Tekesta safely into Kerama Retto, Beale resumed duty with TF 54 providing gunfire support for the troops on Okinawa. Though call fire remained one of the warship's primary missions during her 12 weeks of service in the Ry≈´ky≈´s, the frequency and intensity of the Japanese aerial counterstrokes diverted her attention incessantly from that assignment to air defense. Antiair warfare also intruded upon her other major role at Okinawa, service in the ubiquitous antisubmarine screen. In providing protection from both submarines and aircraft, Beale divided her time between the gunfire support units and the ships that retired each night to safer waters some distance from the shores of Okinawa. The desperate, aerial tactics that the Japanese relied upon as their response to the Okinawa invasion, however, made antiair warfare the predominate form of combat carried out by Navy units in the campaign. Beale, therefore, continued to cross swords with enemy aviators throughout her participation in the island's subjugation. On 16 April, while she screened the fire support ships of TG 51.5 near Ie Shima, three enemy planes attempted attacks on Beale. Her gunfire damaged the first intruder ‚Äì misidentified as a German Focke-Wulf Fw 190 ‚Äî when he tried a suicide dive, and he splashed into the sea well clear of the ship. Almost immediately, though, two \\"Val\\" dive bombers pushed over into conventional bombing attacks, coming in on Beale's starboard side abeam. Her guns opened up on them at a distance of about and continued to fire until a Marine Corps F4U \\"Corsair\\" flew into her field of fire in his attempt to intercept the two \\"Vals.\\" The destroyer ceased fire quickly, but all three planes, the two enemies and one friend, splashed into the ocean at some distance from Beale. Fortunately, the \\"Corsair\\" pilot managed to bail out, and a destroyer escort rescued him. During the month of May, the warship experienced two more close calls with Japan's airborne fanatics. After dark on the 4th, a single engine plane, unrecognizable in the darkness, tried to crash Beale; but again her gunners rose to the challenge and sent the interloper tumbling into the sea a scant away on the port beam. On 28 May, another \\"Val\\" sought to make Beale his funeral pyre; but he, too, succumbed to her antiaircraft barrage and fell into the sea close aboard. By the beginning of June, enemy resistance at Okinawa was on the ebb, both in the air and on the ground. Few planes penetrated the cordon of radar pickets stationed around the island with any regularity or frequency, and the land defense found itself bottled up in several relatively isolated pockets. On 3 June, Beale helped to eradicate of one of those pockets when she supported the landings on Iheya Retto, one of Okinawa's satellite island groups located about 11 miles (20 km) north of the Motobu Peninsula. Organized resistance in the Ry≈´ky≈´s ended at the start of the last week in June, and the campaign for Okinawa closed officially on 2 July. In the meantime on 24 June, Beale shaped a course for Leyte in the Philippines, where she conducted some minor repairs and took on supplies. The destroyer returned to Okinawa on 16 July and joined TF 95, the unit with which she spent the next three weeks of carrying out antishipping sweeps along the China coast, in the Yellow Sea, and in the Sea of Japan. She returned to Okinawa on 8 August, and the war ended during the four weeks that she remained there. Japan agreed to capitulate on 15 August, and her representatives signed the surrender document on 2 September. Beale departed Buckner Bay on 6 September and laid in a course for Japan. She arrived in Nagasaki on the 15th and began duty in support of the Allied occupation. During the next two months, she visited several Japanese ports while engaged in courier duty, demilitarization inspections, and escort missions. On 15 November, the destroyer stood out of Sasebo for the voyage back to the United States. Beale steamed by way of Pearl Harbor and arrived in San Diego on 6 December. Four days later, she returned to sea bound for the East Coast. The warship transited the Panama Canal on the 18th and entered port at Charleston, South Carolina, two days before Christmas 1945. Following a three-month inactivation overhaul, Beale was decommissioned at the Charleston Navy Yard on 11 April 1946. She remained in reserve for almost six years.  1951 ‚Äì 1962  While still part of the inactive fleet, the warship was moved to the Boston Naval Shipyard for conversion to an escort destroyer. Redesignated an escort destroyer, DDE-471, Beale was recommissioned at Boston on 1 November 1951, CDR Frank H. Price, Jr., in command. She remained at Boston finishing her conversion until the second week of 1952. On 8 January, she embarked upon her shakedown cruise which, after a short visit to Norfolk, Virginia, she conducted in the West Indies. After post-shakedown availability at Boston between late March and early May, she reported for duty with the Atlantic Fleet at Norfolk on 5 May. Near the end of the month, the destroyer headed for the Gulf of Mexico where she spent the month of June operating as planeguard for during training operations out of Pensacola, Florida She returned to Norfolk on Independence Day 1952 and resumed normal operations from that port. Training duty in the Virginia Capes operating area and upkeep at Norfolk occupied her time for the remainder of 1952. Late in January 1953, Beale moved south on her way to the large annual fleet exercise called \\"Springboard.\\" After preliminary drills with off the Florida coast near Mayport, she continued on to the vicinity of Puerto Rico where the maneuvers were carried out in late February and early March. The warship arrived back in Norfolk on 13 March and stayed there for a little more than a month. On 17 April, she stood out of Chesapeake Bay bound for exercises in the waters around the British Isles, followed by a short cruise in the Mediterranean. During that deployment, she visited Londonderry in Northern Ireland and Plymouth, England, before transiting the Strait of Gibraltar to call at Golfe Juan, France, and Naples, Italy. The destroyer departed Naples on 13 June, plotted a course back to the United States, and reentered Norfolk on the 26th. She conducted local operations during July and the first part of August and then sailed north to the coast of Nova Scotia where she spent the rest of August serving as planeguard for . Beale arrived back at Norfolk on 4 September and took up the usual routine of local operations and upkeep until the beginning of October. On 2 and 3 October, she made the short voyage to New York where she began a three-month overhaul, her first since rejoining the active fleet. After refresher training off the Cuban coast near Guantanamo Bay early in 1954, the destroyer returned to Norfolk in March to prepare for an assignment overseas. On 11 May, she embarked on a tour of duty in the Mediterranean Sea. Service with the 6th Fleet kept her busy until early that fall when she headed back to the United States. Beale reached Norfolk again on 10 October 1954. The warship spent the rest of the year in port. In January 1955, she took up East Coast operations once again, ranging from Newport, Rhode Island in the north to Puerto Rico and Key West in the south. Beale remained so engaged until late May when she began six weeks of upkeep at Norfolk. At the end of the first week in July, she departed Norfolk and headed back to Newport whence she conducted exercises with carriers briefly before proceeding to the vicinity of Bermuda where she carried out operations with recently commissioned . After assisting in the evaluation of the capabilities of the first nuclear-powered submarine, Beale stood into Norfolk once more on 6 August. A month later, she returned to sea for an abbreviated deployment overseas to participate in two NATO exercises, Operation \\"Centerboard\\" and Operation \\"New Broom IV\\", both of which were carried out in the Atlantic off Portugal. Leaving Lisbon on 10 October, the destroyer reentered Norfolk on the 23d. Following an upkeep and repair period that lasted through the end of the year, Beale resumed local operations off the Virginia Capes early in January 1956. In mid-February, the warship headed south to participate in the annual \\"Springboard\\" fleet exercise carried out in the waters between Cuba and Puerto Rico. Back in Norfolk on 22 March, she conducted type training and similar evolutions in the immediate vicinity through the end of May. On the 31st, Beale left Hampton Roads bound for the Gulf of Mexico where she engaged in further training missions punctuated by visits to Pensacola, New Orleans, and Galveston. The destroyer departed the latter port on 5 July and headed home, arriving back in Norfolk on the 9th. Regular overhaul at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard occupied her time from the middle of July until early November. On 10 November, Beale put to sea for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and a month of post- overhaul refresher training. Back in Norfolk a week before Christmas, she drilled in the local operating area through the first 11 weeks of 1957. On 18 March, she embarked upon a voyage in the course of which she circumnavigated the African continent. Unable to use the Suez Canal, closed as a result of the hostilities between Israel and Egypt that followed in the wake of Nasser's nationalization of the canal the preceding summer, the warship deployed to the Indian Ocean via the long route around southern Africa. Steaming by way of the Azores, Beale reached the African coast at Freetown, Sierra Leone, on 30 March. She visited Simonstown, Union of South Africa, from 10 to 12 April before rounding Cape Agulhas, Africa's southernmost point, on her way to Mombassa, Kenya. After leaving Mombassa, the destroyer sailed to the Persian Gulf where she called at Qeshm, Iran, and Bahrain. From the Persian Gulf, she headed for the reopened Suez Canal via Massawa, Eritrea (now a province of Ethiopia). Beale transited the canal at the beginning of June and arrived at Piraeus, Greece, on the 4th. Between 5 and 14 June, she crossed the Mediterranean Sea to Spain where she spent the ensuing four weeks making calls at the ports of Valencia, Cartagena, and Barcelona. Following a two-day stop at Gibraltar, she embarked upon the voyage across the Atlantic on 14 July and stood into Norfolk again on 26 July. Beale's homecoming lasted less than six weeks, however, for she put to sea again on 3 September bound for the British Isles. She arrived in Plymouth, England, on the 14th and spent the rest of the month engaged in NATO Exercise \\"Stand Firm.\\" At the conclusion of the exercise, the destroyer paid a 10-day visit to Cherbourg. On 10 October, she left the French port to return to the United States. Beale entered Chesapeake Bay once more on 22 October and resumed normal operations along the East Coast. Near the end of March 1958, Beale received word of the cancellation of her scheduled deployment to the Mediterranean in favor of an assignment with Task Group Alfa, an experimental group formed to develop and teach new and advanced antisubmarine defense techniques and procedures. For more than five years, her work with the ASW developmental group kept her tied fairly closely to the East Coast and precluded any tours of duty farther away from the United States than the West Indies.  1962 ‚Äì 1968  That extended assignment did not prevent her from participating in internationally significant events, however, for, after Fidel Castro's insurgents succeeded in overthrowing the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in Cuba in 1959, ships of the Navy performed almost constant patrols off that troubled island. Beale carried out her first such mission between 13 and 26 April 1961, and her second tour of duty in Cuban waters lasted from the end of June until mid-August 1962. On 30 June 1962, she resumed her former destroyer classification and the designation, DD-471. Later that year, after reconnaissance flights over the island revealed the presence of offensive nuclear missiles, President John F. Kennedy declared a \\"quarantine\\" of Cuba to prevent the importation of additional missiles and to secure the removal of those already in place. Beale served on the Cuban Missile Crisis \\"blockade\\" from 25 October to 5 November 1962. During these operations, on Saturday, 27 October, the Beale dropped practice depth charges on Soviet submarine B-59 (Foxtrot) class, after which the submarine surfaced, upon which the Beale closed to within 500 yards on a parallel course, illuminating the Soviet vessel with its 24-inch searchlight (deck log excerpts of USS Beale, available at National Security Archives, \\"National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 75\\", Section II, item 13). It was later revealed from Soviet sources that the depth-charging by the Beale had caused the commander of the Soviet submarine, Savitsky, who was unable to establish radio contact with base, to consider firing a 15-kiloton nuclear torpedo, and had asked two other senior officers to vote, with the dissenting vote of Vasili Arkhipov preventing the launch. After an additional year of service along the East Coast and in the West Indies, Beale completed preparations in November 1963 to embark upon her first major overseas deployment in more than half a decade. On the 29th, she stood out of Norfolk on her way across the Atlantic Ocean. The warship arrived in Pollensa Bay, Majorca, on 11 December and relieved McCaffrey (DD-860) the following afternoon. During her first eight weeks with the 6th Fleet, normal activities such as exercises and port visits occupied her time. Early in February 1964, however, orders sent her to the eastern Mediterranean where she joined a contingency force brought together in response to trouble on the island of Cyprus. Service with the contingency force received her undivided attention until the first week in March. Afterwards, Beale made a six-day liberty call at Istanbul, Turkey, and then returned to sea for further duty in the eastern Mediterranean, an assignment that included NATO exercises in the Ionian Sea. Late in March, she returned to the western portion of the \\"middle sea\\", where she spent the remaining six weeks of her deployment. Completing turnover formalities at Pollensa Bay near the end of the second week in May, Beale transited the Strait of Gibraltar on the 14th and shaped a course for Hampton Roads. Ten days later, she arrived at Norfolk and commenced post-deployment standdown. The destroyer remained in port for over a month, getting underway again early in July for an Independence Day visit to Baltimore, Maryland Following the celebration, she embarked upon the familiar routine of training missions along the East Coast and in the West Indies. That employment took up her time for the remainder of 1964, while a regular overhaul at Norfolk occupied her during the first few months of 1965. After refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay in the summer of 1965, Beale resumed normal operations from Norfolk. After nearly a year of training duty out of her home port, she departed Norfolk on 1 June 1966 bound for the Far East and her first combat assignment in more than two decades. On the outward voyage, she traveled by way of the Panama Canal, Hawaii, and Guam before arriving at the 7th Fleet's base at Subic Bay in the Philippines near the end of the second week in July. Following a tour of duty as station ship at Hong Kong, Beale entered the combat zone in the waters adjacent to Vietnam on 24 July. The next day, she began service as a gunfire support ship on the \\"gunline\\" just off the Vietnamese coast. At the end of two weeks as a floating artillery battery, the warship returned to Subic Bay to replenish and perform maintenance. Late in August, Beale resumed duty on the \\"gunline.\\" In September and October, she served in the screen of the carrier, . Early in November, the destroyer concluded her final tour in the combat zone and began the voyage home. Steaming via the Indian Ocean, the Suez Canal, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean, she completed a circumnavigation of the globe when she pulled into Norfolk on 17 December. The extended standdown period that Beale began upon her return lasted well into 1967. The destroyer did not put to sea again until March, two weeks of which she spent carrying out type training in the Virginia Capes operating area. On 10 April, the warship stood out of Chesapeake Bay for Key West and nearly a month of duty as a school ship for the Fleet Sonar School located there. Back in Norfolk on 8 May, Beale remained relatively inactive until June when she participated in Exercise \\"New Look\\", a 36-ship ASW training effort that involved units of four NATO navies. In July, a board of inspection and survey looked her over and mandated a restricted availability, which she carried out at Baltimore, Maryland, in August. She resumed normal operations out of Norfolk in September, and those evolutions occupied her until the middle of October when she started preparations for her final deployment overseas. On 14 November, the warship passed between Capes Henry and Charles and laid in a course for the Mediterranean Sea. Steaming in company with a quartet of DesRon 32 destroyers that included Beale's sister ship and frequent colleague , she arrived in Pollensa Bay, Majorca, on the 24th. She spent the bulk of her last deployment in the western Mediterranean, sailing east of the Italian \\"boot\\" only once when she entered the Adriatc in late January 1968 to call at Split, Yugoslavia. Her activities in the western basin consisted of a mix of exercises ‚Äì unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral in composition ‚Äì and visits to a variety of French and Italian ports, as well as one brief call at Malta. After being relieved by at M√°laga, Spain, Beale got underway for Norfolk on Easter Sunday 1968. A note of sadness, however, intruded upon the satisfaction usually associated with a homeward bound voyage. Of the four DesRon 32 ships that had accompanied her to the Mediterranean the previous fall, only three joined her in the return trip. A storm at Rhodes early in February had reduced Bache, her frequent comrade over the years, to an unsalvageable wreck. Beale and her depleted complement of traveling companions arrived back in Hampton Roads on 23 April. Following post-deployment leave and upkeep, Beale commenced her last weeks of operations with the Navy late in May. She steamed north to Newport, Rhode Island, where she served as a training platform for the Destroyer School until the latter part of June. On 25 June, the warship returned to Norfolk and began preparations for another review by a board of inspection and survey. The inspection, carried out at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard early in August, resulted in a recommendation that Beale be retired. She was decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia on 30 September 1968, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 October 1968. The former warship performed her last service to the Navy on 24 June 1969 when she was sunk as a target about 250 miles (460 km) east of the mouth of Chesapeake Bay.  Awards  Beale earned six battle stars for World War II service and one battle star during the Vietnam War.

The name was changed to the Wheeling and Lake Erie \\"Railway\\" in May, before operations began. At its formation, trackage rights on Norfolk Southern were extended to the new organization to serve several limestone quarries in the Bellevue, Ohio area, and trackage rights with CSX Transportation from Connellsville, Pennsylvania to Hagerstown, Maryland, this being a remnant of the 1950s Alphabet Route of which the original W&LE; was a part.

Tarasov is considered \\"the father of Russian ice hockey\\" and established the Soviet Union national team as \\"the dominant force in international competition\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Article \\"Anatoly Tarasov\\" He was one of the first Russians to be inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1974 in the builders category. Tarasov also played and managed in the sport of football, but is best known for his work in developing the USSR's ice hockey program. Ice hockey builder After World War II, Tarasov was asked by the Ministry of Sports of the USSR to put together a hockey program from scratch. He helped found a hockey department at the Red Army's sports club, CSKA Moscow with little more than several old hockey rule books. Before then, the most popular ice sport in Russia and the Soviet Union was bandy, a sport similar to field hockey, but played on ice. The Russian style of hockey, with its emphasis on skating skill, offense and passing, is still heavily influenced by bandy. Tarasov served either as coach or co-coach of CSKA Moscow from 1946 to 1975, except for three short breaks in 1960, 1964 and 1972. He was named coach of the Soviet national team in 1958, a post he held until 1960. He was then an assistant coach of Soviet national team to Arkady Chernyshev from 1963 until 1972. When hockey was introduced in the USSR, Tarasov, like the rest of the nation, fell in love with the game. It was his ideals and philosophies that shaped the Russian game into what it is today - fast, graceful, non- individualistic, and patriotic. To him, real teamwork was based on a common aim - comradeship and caring for each team member. This is why he introduced a rule that, in order to make the line-up, the team had to approve of each player.Menz, Kevin. Russia's underachievement in men's Olympic Hockey. The Sheaf, 3/3/2010. http://thesheaf.com/2010/03/03/russia's-underachievement-in- men's-olympic-hockey Tarasov devised many new training techniques. Most of them centered on passing, for he felt passing was the key to their success, \\"after all, the ultimate aim of a pass was to get a free player. So if our opponents make 150 passes in a game against our 270, this means we had 120 more playing opportunities.\\" His practices included the use of pylons and simple drills that would have looked silly to Canadians, but to the Russians they had great meaning as they looked to perfect each skill. While performing these, he had his players in constant motion. He called this the assembly method. Tarasov was a player-coach for HC CSKA Moscow in the late 1940s and early 1950s, and coached notable players which included, Boris Afanasiev, Aleksandr Komarov, Grigory Mkrtychan, Nikolai Sologubov, Andrey Starovoytov, and Dmitry Ukolov. Many great players developed under his system in the 1960s. Among these were heroes like: Vitaly Davydov, Anatoli Firsov, Vyacheslav Starshinov, Veniamin Alexandrov, Alexander Ragulin, Alexander Yakushev, Konstantin Loktev, and goalie, Viktor Konovalenko. Then these were followed by other greats who would represent the Soviet Union in the 1972 Summit Series against Canada. These included: Boris Mikhailov, Vladimir Petrov, Valeri Vasiliev, Alexander Maltsev, Valeri Kharlamov, Viacheslav Fetisov, and a brilliant young goaltender named Vladislav Tretiak. Tarasov was a big factor in the development of Tretiak, who was destined to become one of the most skillful and cherished goalies in international history. In the earliest days of his career, Tarasov had him doing three practices a day as hard as possible while using the maximum consumption of oxygen (MCO). In one instance a Swedish player came to practice in the USSR with Tarasov, but he couldn't last. He reportedly said, \\"We Swedes don't grow up to practice like this. I don't want to die.\\" According to Tretiak, \\"If I let in just one puck, Tarasov would ask me the next day \\"What's the matter?\\" If it was my fault (and it usually appears to be the goalkeeper's fault), my punishment would follow immediately. After everybody else had gone home I had to do hundreds of lunges and somersaults. I could have cheated and not done them at all, since nobody was watching me‚Äîthe coaches had gone home too! But I wouldn't even have considered doing one less lunge or somersault. I trusted Tarasov, trusted his every word, even when he criticized me for letting the pucks in my net during practice.\\" At CSKA Moscow, he won 19 Soviet titles, including all but five from 1955 to 1975 and three instances of winning four titles in a row. He helped lead the Soviet national team to 9 straight world championships, including 3 Olympic gold medals (for most of his tenure, the Olympic championship was considered the world championship). After the 1972 Winter Olympics, Tarasov was fired. Tarasov was known for his ruthless training methods, tough discipline among his players and innovative, instinctive decisions. Many of his methods are continued by his daughter Tatiana Tarasova. He died in 1995 after a long illness.Anatoly Tarasov, 76, Innovative Coach of Hockey in Soviet Union Legacy Having helped to build the Soviet hockey program from scratch, Tarasov became the first Soviet to be enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, being enshrined as a builder. He posthumously received the Wayne Gretzky International Award in 2008. American coach Lou Vairo attended a clinic by Tarasov in 1972 and stated, \\"He told me you don't coach with your feet, you coach with your heart and your brain, and you have to have leadership qualities, drive the boys, work them hard, but do everything you can to support them\\". Today, the Kontinental Hockey League has a division bearing his name, recognizing his role in the development of ice hockey in the USSR and eventually Russia. When referencing Canada, the Soviet Union's long- time rival, Tarasov famously said \\"the Canadians battled with the ferocity and intensity of a cornered animal\\". \\"Our players were better conditioned physically and stronger in skills than the Canadian professionals. But we could not match them in heart and desire, always the strongest part of the Canadian game\\". On December 10, 2019, Google celebrated his 101st birthday with a Google Doodle.

The school is divided into lower (kindergarten ‚Äì grade 4), middle (grades 5‚Äì8) and upper (grades 9‚Äì12) schools, with approximately 50 to 60 students per grade. In addition to being a member of the New York Interschool Association, Brearley is considered a sister school of the all-boys Collegiate School, the all-girls Spence School and the nearby all-girls Chapin School, with which it shares an after-school program and some classes.  History  Samuel A. Brearley founded The Brearley School in 1884, and remained the head of school until 1886, when he died of typhoid fever. James G. Croswell was the next head until his death in 1915. Since 1926, Brearley has been headed by women, first by Millicent Carey McIntosh. In June 2011, headmistress Stephanie J. Hull resigned for undisclosed reasons. In the early 1900s, Brearley moved from East 45th Street to West 44th Street and then in 1912 to Park Avenue and East 61st Street, where the primary program was added. The school then moved to a new building in 1929 on East 83rd Street. Brearley opened a new building at 590 East 83rd Street in Fall 2019, one block away from its existing building at 610 East 83rd street. Brearley plans to renovate 610 during the summers. For the most part, the lower school will reside in 590 and the middle and upper schools will be in 610, although older students may go from building to building for different classes.  Academics  The school's curriculum is based on the liberal arts. The student-to-faculty ratio is 6:1. Language instruction is offered in Ancient Greek, Latin, French, Spanish, and Mandarin Chinese. Students have access to two computer laboratories ‚Äî one serving the Lower School, the other the Middle and Upper Schools. In addition, there are three smaller computer workrooms, one for middle schoolers and two for upper schoolers, as well as the science-projects room and laptops for use in the library and classrooms. Students in grades 7 and 8 are given iPads for the school year to aid with work in classes and assignments at home. In high school, students are expected to bring their own device, such as a laptop or iPad.  Rankings and college attendance  In 2008, Brearley was ranked number two in the country by The Wall Street Journal based on its ranking of students matriculating to eight selected colleges and universities. It was ranked second-best prep school in the United States and best all-girls school by Forbes in 2013. A 2019-20 survey concluded that Brearley was the second- best girls school in the country and the fifth-best private K-12 school in the country.  Student body  As of 2019, Brearley enrolled 724 students in K-12. Students of color represented approximately half of the student body. The 2018-19 tuition was $49,680. Approximately 20% of the students received the $6.1 million that was available for financial assistance.  Sports facilities  A separate building, the \\"Field House\\" on East 87th Street, has facilities for physical education and athletics including track, soccer, basketball, tennis, badminton, volleyball, lacrosse and field hockey. Brearley fields varsity teams in 13 sports. The school's team colors are maroon and white, and its mascot is a beaver.

He was born in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, but is now based in Beverly Hills, California, and Paris, France, with his wife. He is an ex-collegian of English College Johore Bahru.  Background  Shake came from a big family of four brothers and five sisters, in which he was the third youngest. As a small boy Shake dreamed of making music and distant shores. He spent his teenage years singing at his hometown's nightclub where he performed cover versions of songs by Rolling Stone, Tom Jones, Stevie Wonder, Elvis Presley and The Beatles . European artists in Malaysia encouraged him to try his luck in Europe, so he went there in the mid-1970s and Paris, France and then London, England was his first stop, where he studied for a year with classical vocal coach John Dolby .  Career  He went to Paris, France in 1973. In 1976 he had secured a label and his first single was released, titled, \\"Tu sais je t'aime\\" (You know I love you). Shake's new single climbed the charts, followed by half a dozen other gold and platinum singles and albums in France . This made him the first notable Asian singer to sing in French , concert appearances and television specials followed and Shake became known in many French speaking countries. He wanted to bring others to his homeland and the forefront of the music business, and started campaigns to fight against uncontrolled music piracy in South East Asia which he found disappointing. For five consecutive years, Shake toured France and Belgium for 70 days each summer . He also performed concerts in Switzerland, Greece, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Brunei. Shake was invited to do Royal Performances for the King of Malaysia and The Sultan of Brunei, and performed at the Shrine Auditorium Los Angeles USA for Valentine's Day for an audience of 6,000 . Recorded music sales have surpassed 60 million worldwide in all French speaking countries, including Canada, Pacific Islands, North Africa and Asia. Albums have been recorded in Malay, French, Italian and English. Performing at many prestigious festivals, including the Paris World Music Festival; Tokyo songs festival; Festival de Venice, Festival de Cortina and Verona in Italy;Festival of Artist in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, Indonesia and Malaysia Songs Festival. In Hollywood, Shake worked on his album with producer/artist Michael Sembello, the guitarist / producer from the group Cars Elliot Easton and Dayrell Ross producer / songwriter . He is working on his own unique sound and style, which comes from his music experienced in Europe and Asia mixed with American pop rock. Shake has recorded his album with sound engineers and studios in Los Angeles and Paris for his recent English album .  Awards  Shake was conferred the title of Dato DPMJ in 1979 by the late Sultan Ismail ibni Sultan Ibrahim of Johore on the latter's request, in grateful appreciation for \\"bringing Malaysia to the attention of the world\\". He was also given the medal of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres type Chevalier from the government of France for his contributions promoting the French language and culture in Asia, where English is the more predominant European language used. Shake has performed on more than 30 television shows, variety appearances in Europe, Canada and Asia. In 1976, he was deemed as the first Asian singer to make an international career in Europe singing in French, Italian and English.  Personal life  Shake currently lives in Beverly Hills and Paris, France . He is the father of 4 children, namely Nic Shake, Amaro Shake, Mina and Natacha Shake. Nic works as an actor while Amaro is a film director.

The diamond cubic crystal structure is a repeating pattern of 8 atoms that certain materials may adopt as they solidify. While the first known example was diamond, other elements in group 14 also adopt this structure, including Œ±-tin, the semiconductors silicon and germanium, and silicon/germanium alloys in any proportion. Although often called the diamond lattice, this structure is not a lattice in the technical sense of this word used in mathematics. Crystallographic structure Visualisation of a diamond cubic unit cell: 1. Components of a unit cell, 2. One unit cell, 3. A lattice of unit cells Diamond's cubic structure is in the Fdm space group, which follows the face- centered cubic Bravais lattice. The lattice describes the repeat pattern; for diamond cubic crystals this lattice is \\"decorated\\" with a motif of two tetrahedrally bonded atoms in each primitive cell, separated by of the width of the unit cell in each dimension.. The diamond lattice can be viewed as a pair of intersecting face-centered cubic lattices, with each separated by of the width of the unit cell in each dimension. Many compound semiconductors such as gallium arsenide, Œ≤-silicon carbide, and indium antimonide adopt the analogous zincblende structure, where each atom has nearest neighbors of an unlike element. Zincblende's space group is F3m, but many of its structural properties are quite similar to the diamond structure.. The atomic packing factor of the diamond cubic structure (the proportion of space that would be filled by spheres that are centered on the vertices of the structure and are as large as possible without overlapping) is ‚âà 0.34,. significantly smaller (indicating a less dense structure) than the packing factors for the face- centered and body-centered cubic lattices.. Zincblende structures have higher packing factors than 0.34 depending on the relative sizes of their two component atoms. The first-, second-, third-, fourth- and fifth-nearest- neighbor distances in units of the cubic lattice constant are , , , 1 and , respectively. Mathematical structure Mathematically, the points of the diamond cubic structure can be given coordinates as a subset of a three- dimensional integer lattice by using a cubic unit cell four units across. With these coordinates, the points of the structure have coordinates (x, y, z) satisfying the equations :x = y = z (mod 2), and :x + y + z = 0 or 1 (mod 4).. There are eight points (modulo 4) that satisfy these conditions: :(0,0,0), (0,2,2), (2,0,2), (2,2,0), :(3,3,3), (3,1,1), (1,3,1), (1,1,3) All of the other points in the structure may be obtained by adding multiples of four to the x, y, and z coordinates of these eight points. Adjacent points in this structure are at distance apart in the integer lattice; the edges of the diamond structure lie along the body diagonals of the integer grid cubes. This structure may be scaled to a cubical unit cell that is some number a of units across by multiplying all coordinates by . Alternatively, each point of the diamond cubic structure may be given by four-dimensional integer coordinates whose sum is either zero or one. Two points are adjacent in the diamond structure if and only if their four-dimensional coordinates differ by one in a single coordinate. The total difference in coordinate values between any two points (their four-dimensional Manhattan distance) gives the number of edges in the shortest path between them in the diamond structure. The four nearest neighbors of each point may be obtained, in this coordinate system, by adding one to each of the four coordinates, or by subtracting one from each of the four coordinates, accordingly as the coordinate sum is zero or one. These four-dimensional coordinates may be transformed into three-dimensional coordinates by the formula :(a, b, c, d) ‚Üí (a + b ‚àí c ‚àí d, a ‚àí b + c ‚àí d, ‚àía + b + c ‚àí d).. Because the diamond structure forms a distance-preserving subset of the four-dimensional integer lattice, it is a partial cube. Yet another coordinatization of the diamond cubic involves the removal of some of the edges from a three-dimensional grid graph. In this coordinatization, which has a distorted geometry from the standard diamond cubic structure but has the same topological structure, the vertices of the diamond cubic are represented by all possible 3d grid points and the edges of the diamond cubic are represented by a subset of the 3d grid edges.. The diamond cubic is sometimes called the \\"diamond lattice\\" but it is not, mathematically, a lattice: there is no translational symmetry that takes the point (0,0,0) into the point (3,3,3), for instance. However, it is still a highly symmetric structure: any incident pair of a vertex and edge can be transformed into any other incident pair by a congruence of Euclidean space. Moreover, the diamond crystal as a network in space has a strong isotropic property. Namely, for any two vertices x and y of the crystal net, and for any ordering of the edges adjacent to x and any ordering of the edges adjacent to y, there is a net-preserving congruence taking x to y and each x-edge to the similarly ordered y-edge. Another (hypothetical) crystal with this property is the Laves graph (also called the K4 crystal, (10,3)-a, or the diamond twin).

Flexible response was a defense strategy implemented by John F. Kennedy in 1961 to address the Kennedy administration's skepticism of Dwight Eisenhower's New Look and its policy of massive retaliation. Flexible response calls for mutual deterrence at strategic, tactical, and conventional levels, giving the United States the capability to respond to aggression across the spectrum of war, not limited only to nuclear arms. History The New Look policy, though initially useful, quickly became obsolete with the introduction of inter-continental delivery systems that undermined the credibility of a deterrence threat. The cornerstone of U.S. and European defense strategy was then threatened as the U.S. could no longer rely on nuclear threats to provide security for it and its allies. John F. Kennedy won the presidency by claiming that the Republican Party had allowed the U.S. to fall behind the Soviets into a missile gap. Upon entering office Kennedy cited General Maxwell Taylor's book The Uncertain Trumpet to Congress for its conclusion that massive retaliation left the U.S. with only two choices: defeat on the ground or the resort to the use of nuclear weapons. Technology had improved since massive retaliation was adopted. Improvements in communication and transportation meant U.S. forces could be deployed more effectively, quickly, and flexibly than before. Advisers persuaded Kennedy that having multiple options would allow the president to apply the appropriate amount of force at the right place without risking escalation or losing alternatives. This would improve credibility for deterrence as the U.S. would now have low-intensity options and therefore would be more likely to use them, rather than massive retaliation's all-or-nothing options. Flexible Response was implemented to develop several options across the spectrum of warfare, other than the nuclear option, for quickly dealing with enemy aggression. In addition, the survivability of the retaliatory capability was stressed, leading to the diversification of the strategic force, development of the strategic triad, and half the Strategic Air Command force being put on permanent alert status. The Kennedy doctrine did not include the ability to fight nuclear wars because of the idea that it would undermine deterrence, was technologically unworkable, would fuel the arms race, and was not politically feasible. Importance was also placed on counterinsurgency and the development of unconventional military forces, unconventional tactics, and \\"civic action\\" programs. Stages A staged plan was devised to counter any Soviet military action other than a first strike. It consisted of three stages: Direct defense: In case of a conventional Soviet attack (meaning non-nuclear therefore not considered a first strike) initial efforts would be to try and stop the Soviet advance with conventional weapons. This meant that the foreseen Soviet attack on West-Germany would be tried to be forced to a halt by NATO's European forces, Allied Command Europe. Deliberate Escalation: This phase would be entered when conventional NATO forces were succumbing under the Soviet attack. This was actually expected as intelligence indicated Soviet divisions outnumbered NATO divisions by far. In this phase NATO forces would switch to a limited use of nuclear weapons, such as recently developed tactical nuclear weapons (like nuclear artillery). General Nuclear Response: This was the last phase or stage which more or less corresponded to the mutual assured destruction scenario, meaning the total nuclear attack on the Communist world likely resulting in a Soviet response in kind, if they had not already done so. Development of the strategic triad By 1960, the United States had three means of strategic forces: ICBMs, SLBMs, and strategic bombers. This triad made it possible for the United States to impose unacceptable damage to the Soviet Union with one strategic force independent of the other two forces. These different forces had their advantages and disadvantages. Bombers could deliver large payloads and strike with great accuracy, but were slow, vulnerable while on the ground, and could be shot down. ICBMs are safe in their underground silos while on the ground, but were less accurate than bombers and could not be called back when launched. Submarines were least vulnerable but were also least accurate and communication could be poor at times. Each of these forces provided the United States with different options to tailor their response to the situation. Two-and-a-half war doctrine Part of Flexible response was the strategy of being able to fight over the entire spectrum of violence by developing diverse forces for different types of warfare. This meant being able to fight multiple wars simultaneously; specifically, the US should have the peacetime capability to fight two large regional wars and a small brushfire war at the same time. The consequence of this was to increase recruiting, investment, and research for the US force posture. Assured destruction The strategic doctrine for Kennedy's Flexible response was Assured Destruction. Flexible response made second strike capability its guiding principle of deterrence. In the event of Soviet nuclear aggression, the Soviets would know that enough U.S. nuclear capability would survive their strike to destroy their cities and industry. Robert McNamara argued for the definition of what was \\"unacceptable\\" to the enemy as the destruction of 50% of industry and 25% of the population. Deterrence depended on influence to show that violence and aggression did not pay, and being explicit about the level of destruction the US was willing to inflict on the enemy was one way to illustrate this point. Assured Destruction relied on deterrence by punishment, precision, and credibility. =No-cities doctrine= Defense Secretary McNamara sought to limit damage to the U.S. by developing a separate strategy for offense and defense. The offensive strategy was one of Counterforce, seeking to destroy Soviet military installations and hardware and thus disable this hardware before it could be used. In a 1962 speech to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, McNamara announced that the U.S. would refrain from striking countervalue targets (cities) early in nuclear war, reserving such force later in war should the Soviets not show similar restraint. This would not only induce the Soviets to spare American cities, but would secure the United States bargaining advantage by holding hostage something that the Soviets might want to keep. The defensive strategy involved developing a system to intercept incoming Soviet missiles. Bombers could be easily shot down, but missiles still remained a credible threat. As a result, the United States began developing an anti-ballistic missile program, modifying its Nike missiles to intercept incoming missiles. Ultimately, however, this program was abandoned by the adoption of the anti-ballistic missile treaty.

Columbia Brewery began brewing Kokanee lager in 1959 and was purchased by the Labatt Brewing Company in 1974. Labatt Brewing is now part of the new company, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, which is trading as BUD on the New York Stock Exchange; (ABI:BB in Brussels.) The Beer right Kokanee is a Pilsner Style Lager with 5.0% alcohol. Kokanee beer is aged naturally and has a relatively mild taste. A light beer, it is most-commonly found in the Western provinces of Canada and the Pacific Northwest states of the USA, with sparse distribution in Eastern provinces and states. The Columbia Brewery also brews Kokanee Gold, with a fuller body and 5.3% alcohol content, Kokanee Light, and Kootenay True Ale. =Marketing= The company's \\"Glacier Fresh\\" marketing slogan for the beer originates from the usage of mountain stream water in its brewing. It uses three varieties of malt and a blend of western grown North American hops. Marketing the brand Kokanee started life as a niche brand by attempting to appeal with only radio ads to the residents of the interior of British Columbia with the slogan, \\"Brewed right in the Kootenays\\". After Labatt bought the Columbia Brewery in 1974, they hired the advertising agency WestCan later to be known as Scali McCabe Sloves whose Vancouver office produced a number of humorous radio and then international award-winning TV campaigns introducing \\"The Sasquatch\\", including, for instance,(and still under the name WestCan at the time) 2 IBA's for TV. Two International Broadcast Awards and both introducing the legendary Sasquatch trademark and this success in TV to then take the brand to market domination and peak with a 30% plus brand share in 1986. These Sasquatch ads also were featured on the NBC \\"Tonight Show\\" as samples of the \\"World's Best\\". Other later efforts included a mock documentary showing Kokanee bottles migrating up a stream like salmon. These helped the brand become the market leader with a share of 17% in 1992. The Sasquatch 25 years later still a critical trademark for this effective branding. In 1992, Labatt hired Beakbane Marketing, Toronto, to revitalize the packaging. Unusual for the time, they changed the icon of the Kokanee Glacier to a photo montage that was shot from a helicopter by nature photographer Alec Pytlowany. The image of the glacier was used on all packaging materials including bottle labels, cans and cartons. At that time a small sasquatch icon was developed and hidden in each design. The brand was introduced to Ontario in 1996, but to save on shipping the beer was brewed at Labatt's facility in London, Ontario. Molson Breweries launched a preemptive advertising campaign questioning the beers legitimacy, with the slogan \\"B.C. or B.S.?\\". In 2001, Labatt re-launched Kokanee, trucking it in from the brewery in Creston. Kokanee's current marketing slogans are \\"It's The Beer Out Here\\" and \\"Glacier Fresh\\". Kokanee advertisements are frequently shown on Canadian television stations and center around the beer's official mascot the Sasquatch. Later the ad campaign follows the storyline of the \\"Kokanee Ranger\\", played by John Novak; and his unsuccessful attempts to hunt and catch the Sasquatch who is stealing Kokanee beer. These commercials parody the real life Sasquatch hunter Ren√© Dahinden, who appeared in the first Kokanee commercial of its kind. According to the ad campaign, the Ranger eventually recruited three Glacier Girls to join the search to catch the elusive Sasquatch. These girls were originally introduced first in 1985 as \\"The Kokettes\\". In 2008, a new campaign encouraged customers to visit a website (RangerLiveOrDie.ca) and vote on whether the Kokanee Ranger should live or die. The campaign concluded on August 17, with the Kokanee Ranger ultimately being killed off in a commercial that spoofed the last few minutes of the final episode of The Sopranos. It is still unknown who, or what, will replace the Ranger as Kokanee's new spokesperson. Kokanee also sponsored the annual Crankworx mountain biking festival in Whistler, British Columbia. In 2011, Kokanee launched a Facebook campaign that encouraged Kokanee drinkers to vote for a new Ranger as Sasq's raids on Kokanee residents' beer in the absence of the Ranger grew bolder. A TV ad showed the late Ranger as a ghost resuming his post and duties, discovering he's dead as his hand passes through a bottle of Kokanee, remembering \\"you killed me off!\\" indignantly, and sourly wished the viewers \\"good luck\\" in finding his replacement. Voters chose from a varied choice of candidates: \\"Ma Ranger\\", the mother of the Kokanee Ranger; \\"Micheal Baystreet\\" a Gordon Gekko-like TSX day trader; \\"Cory\\", a Ski instructor who has skied the Rockies since the '80s and needs some responsibility; \\"Beer Fridge 2.0\\", a beer cooler with a lock; \\"Glacier and Fresh\\", a Starsky and Hutchesque buddy duo eager to make their mark by stopping Sasq's crime wave; and \\"Glacier Goat\\" a foul mouthed cantankerous goat. http://www.marketingmag.ca/news/marketer-news/kokanee-restarts-its- ranger-advertising-34786 The candidates also had individual Facebook pages as fictional characters, posting articles, videos, and responding to fans posts on their pages campaigning, and unveiling story lines to their own niche dynamics. Micheal Baystreet, seeks to redevelop the Kootenays with condo high rise apartments, Ma wants to satisfy her widow lusts.http://apps.facebook.com/kokanee_nextranger/?ref=bookmarks&count;=0&fb;_source=bookmarks_apps&fb;_bmpos=4_0 Kokanee drinkers voted for \\"Glacier and Fresh\\" after a narrow election victory over runner up \\"Goat\\". In May 2012, Kokanee and Alliance Films announced that it would be producing a feature-length film for release in 2013. Known as The Movie Out Here, the film (which was also co-produced by Grip Limited, the agency behind some of Kokanee's recent campaigns) was promoted by Kokanee using a social media and crowdsourcing-oriented marketing campaign of its own, and serves as Labatt's first experiment with feature-length branded content. The name Kokanee is also a name for landlocked Sockeye salmon. The beer is named after the Kokanee Glacier in the Kootenays region in which Creston is situated. The label The picture on the label consists of a mountain known as Grays Peak in Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, British Columbia, named after Lt. Robert Hampton Gray, VC, RCNVR, and his brother, Flt Sgt John Balfour Gray, RCAF, both of whom were killed in World War II. It shows a man or Sasquatch standing on top of one of the peaks. The entity is not in the pictures on Kokanee's box packaging. He appears only on the cans or bottles themselves, and is located in one of five various spots on bottles, and in different positions on different cans.

MapInfo Corporation, initially incorporated as Navigational Technologies Incorporated, was a company that developed location intelligence software. It was headquartered in North Greenbush, New York. Its products included a desktop mapping application, various map and demographic data products, and some web-based applications. It acquired several other companies in order to market their software, data, or services directly. It was acquired on April 19, 2007 by Pitney Bowes. History MapInfo was founded in 1986 by Laszlo Bardos, Andrew Dressel, John Haller, and Sean O‚ÄôSullivan. The four were students at nearby Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who wanted to develop an inexpensive mapping tool for the PC. They got a contract to develop bus routes for a local school district, and used the money to develop their first product. They contacted Michael Marvin early in the company's history for advice on how to form the company. Marvin helped to set up the business and used his community contacts to raise seed capital.MapInfo Company Profile The company originated as a Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute incubator project. The first intended product was for in-car navigation, but this was abandoned when inertial navigation proved impractical. Early competition for MapInfo software came from Strategic Mapping, which had been founded by Steve Poizner around the same time. Later, Strategic Mapping was sold to Claritas Worldwide in May 1996. Its other competitor was ESRI, which primarily sold expensive GIS software for engineering workstations. MapInfo appeared at number 23 in Inc. Magazine's annual list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. in 1992. MapInfo held an initial public offering (IPO) on February 1, 1994. In the years prior to the IPO, Marvin served as Chairman of the Board, hiring the CEO and making sure he was comfortable with how the company was being managed. Marvin insisted that the company be run on a cash flow break- even basis, but did raise a rainy-day fund of $2 million from Greylock Partners in 1989. MapInfo hired Brian D. Owen to be the CEO in 1991, who brought in Matthew Szulik as VP of Sales and Doug Finlay as CFO. Robertson Stephens was the lead investment bank that managed the IPO. On April 19, 2007 Pitney Bowes entered into a merger agreement to acquire MapInfo Corporation for approximately $408 million in cash. Following the acquisition, MapInfo changed its name to Pitney Bowes MapInfo Corporation. On December 18, 2007 Pitney Bowes also acquired Encom Technology whose products include Encom Discover and Encom Engage which are the major plugins for MapInfo Professional. As of January 28, 2009, MapInfo and Group 1 Software were operating as one division called Pitney Bowes Business Insight. On August 26, 2019, Pitney Bowes sold its software division (which includes MapInfo Professional) to Syncsort for $700 million in cash Product history MapInfo developed the first desktop GIS in 1986 . Originally, the intention was to create an easy-to-use software package that did not require exceedingly large amounts of computing power. MapInfo provided the first tools to Microsoft that allowed them to include mapping functionality in their products, specifically the mapping add-on branded as Microsoft Map for Microsoft Excel as part of MS Office 95. The add-on was subsequently included in Microsoft Office 97, and Microsoft Office 2000. This provided the inspiration for the Microsoft MapPoint program, which became a separate product from Microsoft, and since then Microsoft Map was dropped. MapInfo developed a spatial datablade for Informix and collaborated with Oracle Corporation to develop the original spatial cartridge for the Oracle 8i database. In 2000, MapInfo partnered with Lucent to \\"develop location-based services for mobile communications devices.\\" Acquisition history *2007: Encom Technology, a supplier of specialist software, data and services to the global mineral exploration and petroleum industries. *2007: Graphical Data Capture, a developer of applications and offerer of consulting services primarily to local and regional UK govt authorities, in addition to utilities, financial services and insurance cos. *2005: MarkeTech Systems, Inc., a Raleigh, North Carolina-based provider of software, data and services for use by retail banks to enhance branch network sales and profitability. *2005: GeoBusiness Solutions Limited (location-based analytical and modeling services and software in the UK) *2004: Southbank Systems, a supplier of Asset Management systems and services to local government, civil engineering companies and utilities, primarily within the UK but also within New Zealand, Australia and the Asia pacific markets *2003: Thompson Associates, one of the top providers of retail site selection consulting. *2000: Compusearch Inc., a provider of micro-marketing segmentation and market analysis software in Canada. *1998: On Target Mapping, telecommunications mapping provider in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania *1997: The Data Consultancy (formerly The Unit for Retail Planning Information (URPI)), a MapInfo partner with products and expertise in market analysis and data products in the UK.

Note the use of a map, photographs, and text to explain the subject, sited at a relevant location. Heritage interpretation refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods. Some international authorities in museology prefer the term mediation for the same concept, following usage in other European languages. Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated interpretation centres or at museums, historic sites, parks, art galleries, nature centres, zoos, aquaria, botanical gardens, nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include guided walks, talks, drama, staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called interpretive planning. The thematic approach to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the National Association for Interpretation, the US National Park Service, and others, is considered best practice. Those who practice this form of interpretation may include rangers, guides, naturalists, actors (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, docents, educators, visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles. The interpretive process is often assisted by new technologies such as visualizing techniques.Sideris A., 2008. \\"Re-contextualized Antiquity: Interpretative VR Visualisation of Ancient Art and Architecture\\" in Mikropoulos T. A. and Papachristos N. M. (eds.), Proceedings: International Symposium on ‚ÄúInformation and Communication Technologies in Cultural Heritage‚Äù October 16‚Äì18, 2008, University of Ioannina 2008, , pp. 159-176.  Purpose  Biscayne National Park ranger shows a hermit crab to children The goal of interpretation is to improve and enrich the visitor experience by helping site visitors understand the significance of the place they are visiting, and connecting those meanings to visitors' own personal lives. By weaving compelling, thematic stories about environmental phenomena and historical events, interpreters aim to provoke visitors to learn and think about their experiences. Effective interpretation enables the visitors to make associations between the information given and their previous perceptions.Moscardo, G.(1996) Mindful Visitors: Heritage and Tourism , Elsevier According to Moscardo interpretation can produce 'Mindful Visitors' who are carefully processing information and negotiating the meanings of the observed object or intangible element. Interpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote environmental stewardship of the lands they manage.  Definitions of heritage interpretation   \\"Tilden's principles\\" of interpretation  In his 1957 book, \\"Interpreting Our Heritage\\", Freeman Tilden defined six principles of interpretation: For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published \\"Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture\\", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in \\"The Gift of Interpretation\\".Beck, L, Cable,T.

It employed 456 active duty personnel, 1,663 Army reservist, and 1,667 civilians. In 1973, its were annexed by Forest Park. The fort was named in the memory of Lieutenant General Alvan Cullom Gillem, Jr.. History The US Army established Fort Gillem in 1940 with the simultaneous construction of the Atlanta Quartermaster Depot and the Atlanta Ordnance Depot, which were mostly completed by December 1942. The two installations operated separately until April 1, 1948, when consolidated physically and operationally as the 'Atlanta Army Depot', a subcommand of the Army Materiel Command. The Atlanta Army Depot was deactivated on June 28, 1974. Environmental contamination Buried landfills have contaminated ground water under neighborhoods north and south of Gillem, and inspectors sampled indoor air early summer 2014 for vapor intrusion. , 40 homes had been tested and 26 homes were found to have elevated levels of benzene and trichlorethylene. The chemicals, which entered the homes through groundwater, are those commonly used to strip metal\\" per the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. The Army plans to install air ventilation systems in these homes to \\"eliminate or greatly reduce any risk\\". If higher levels are found in any other homes, larger mitigation efforts will be undertaken during which residents would relocate. Base closure and redevelopment On May 13, 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure commission recommended that Fort Gillem, along with Fort McPherson and the Navy Supply Corps School be closed.Fort Gillem, New Georgia Encyclopedia. An exit ceremony was held at Fort Gillem on June 3, 2011, and First Army troops stationed there were transferred to the Rock Island Arsenal in Rock Island, Illinois. In 2012, after five years of negotiations with the Army, the City of Forest Park purchased 1,170 acres comprising most of the former Fort Gillem for $30 million, and ownership was transferred to the Forest Park/Fort Gillem Implementation Local Redevelopment Authority (ILRA).Kathy Jefcoats, City officials wanted mixed-use development on the property, but following the housing crash turned their focus to industrial, manufacturing, warehouse and business park development. The only private residences are a 125-unit development owned by The Park, which has a lease with the Army until 2025. There are around 165 acres of contaminated groundwater on the site the cleanup of which the Army is responsible for. The clean up of the land was expected to take ten years. The Criminal Investigations Division Crime Lab, a forensic crime laboratory, remains open on a 250-acre enclave retained by the Army. It was decided to list Fort Gillem on the National Priorities List (NPL) of superfunds. On June 3, the Director of Georgia Department of Natural Resources Environmental Protection Division, 2013, Judson Turner, requested from USEPA Region IV that the decision be postponed. On May 2, 2014 officials from the city and the Department of Defense under exclusion of the public held a ceremony at Fort Gillem to commemorate the impending move. The city is partnering with developer Weeks Robinson Properties and hopes it will be booming again, when land re-enters the city and county‚Äôs tax digest and \\"companies such as Porsche North America [are] moving their headquarters to the Forest Park and Hapeville area\\".

It includes development of the Piltun-Astokhskoye oil field and the Lunskoye natural gas field offshore Sakhalin Island in the Okhotsk Sea, and associated infrastructure onshore. The project is managed and operated by Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. (Sakhalin Energy). Sakhalin-2 includes the first liquefied natural gas plant in Russia. The development is situated in areas previously little touched by human activity, causing various groups to criticize the development activities and the impact they have on the local environment. History The original consortium, was a joint venture between Marathon Oil, Mc Dermott, and Mitsubishi. They won a tender from the Russian Government in 1992. Later that year Royal Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi joined the joint venture. In 1994 the JV incorporated in Bermuda to form Sakhalin Energy Investment Company Ltd. Sakhalin Energy, led by Marathon, negotiated the first PSA directly with representatives of the Russian government. The Russian Party maintained project planning and budget approval. The initial investment decision was to proceed with the oil field development led by Marathon. McDermott sold its share to the other partners in 1997 and Marathon traded its shares to Shell for an interest in other properties (the BP operated Foinaven field, near the Shetland Islands, and an eight block area in the Gulf of Mexico‚Äîincluding the Ursa field) in 2000. The decision to proceed with the gas project investment was made in 2003. The expected budget increased dramatically by 2005‚Äì2006. The pipeline portion of the gas project was heavily criticized due to environmental issues. Legal proceeding on perceived violation of the Russian environmental regulations were initiated. In the result, The Russian government ordered to terminate the project on September 2006. Under legal and political pressure, the consortium was forced to sell a majority stake to Gazprom. On 21 December, Gazprom took control over a 50%-plus-one-share stake in the project by signing an agreement with Royal Dutch Shell. Russian President Vladimir Putin attended the signing ceremony in Moscow and indicated that environmental issues had been resolved. The LNG plant was inaugurated on 18 February 2009. The first cargo was loaded to the LNG carrier Grand Aniva at the end of March 2009. Technical features Dmitry Medvedev, Taro Aso, Prince Andrew, Duke of York and Maria van der Hoeven visit the Sakhalin-II project on 18 February 2009. The two fields contain an estimated of crude oil and 500 billion cubic meters (18 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas; 9.6 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas per year and about of oil will be produced. The total project cost until 2014 was originally estimated by Royal Dutch Shell to be between US$9 and $11 billion. However, the costs turned out to be substantially underestimated and in July 2005 Shell revised the estimate upwards to $20 billion. Sakhalin-2 project includes: *Piltun-Astokhskoye-A platform (the Molikpaq, the PA-A) *Lunskoye-A platform (the Lun-A) *Piltun-Astokhskoye-B platform (the PA-B) *Onshore processing facility *TransSakhalin pipelines *Oil export terminal *LNG plant *Plans for an additional platform (the PA-C) =Piltun-Astokhskoye-A platform= The Molikpaq drilling and oil production platform (Piltun- Astokhskoye-A platform) is an ice-resistant structure, originally built to explore for oil in the Canadian Beaufort Sea. It had been mothballed in 1990, and was installed in the Astokh area of the Piltun-Astokhskoye field, offshore, on September 1998. The Molikpaq has production capacity of of oil and 1.7 million cubic meters of associated gas. =Lunskoye-A platform= Lunskoye platform under construction Offshore Lun-A platform The Lunskoye field platform was installed in June 2006 at the Lunskoye gas field offshore. It has production capacity over 50 million cubic meters of natural gas, around of peak liquids (associated water and condensate), and of oil.Lunskoye Platform (LUN-A) www.sakhalinenergy.ru =Piltun-Astokhskoye-B platform= The PA-B platform was installed in July 2007 in the Piltun area of the Piltun- Astokhskoye oil field, offshore. The PA-B has production capacity of of oil and 2.8 million cubic meters of associated gas.PA-B Platform www.sakhalinenergy.ru =Onshore processing facility= The onshore processing facility is located in the north-east of Sakhalin Island, inland in Nogliki district. It is designed to process natural gas, condensate, and oil from the Lunskoye and the Piltun-Astokhskoye fields prior to pipeline transportation to the oil export terminal and the liquefied natural gas plant in Aniva Bay in the south of Sakhalin Island.Onshore Processing Facility www.sakhalinenergy.ru =TransSakhalin pipelines= The TransSakhalin pipeline system is designed for transportation of hydrocarbons from the Piltun-Astokhskoye and Lunskoye fields in the North of Sakhalin Island to the onshore processing facility in the Nogliki district and to the LNG plant and the oil export terminal in Aniva Bay.Onshore Pipeline www.sakhalinenergy.ru =Oil export terminal= The oil export terminal is located in Aniva Bay to the east of the LNG plant. It includes the export pipeline and the tanker loading unit, where oil-loading to tankers is performed.Oil Export Terminal www.sakhalinenergy.ru =LNG plant= The Sakhalin-2 LNG plant is the first of its kind in Russia. It is located in Prigorodnoye in Aniva Bay, east of Korsakov. Construction of the LNG plant was carried out by OAO Nipigaspererabothka (Nipigas) and the KhimEnergo consortium, together with two Japanese companies Chiyoda Corporation and Toyo Engineering Corporation. The plant has been designed to prevent major loss of containment in the event of an earthquake and to ensure the structural integrity of critical elements such as emergency shut down valves and the control room of the plant. The LNG plant includes: *Two LNG storage tanks *An LNG jetty *Two LNG processing trains, each with capacity of 4.8 million tons of LNG per year *Two refrigerant storage spheres, each (gross capacity) for propane and ethane storage *A diesel fuel system *A heat transfer fluid system for the supply of heat to various process consumers *Five gas turbine driven generators with a total capacity of around 129 MW electrical power *Utility systems including instrument air and nitrogen plants and diesel fuel systems *A waste water treatment plant to treat both sewage water and coil-containing water. The LNG plant production capacity is 9.6 million tons of LNG per year. The consortium is examining the possibility of adding another train. A special gas liquefaction process was developed by Shell for use in cold climates such as Sakhalin, based on the use of a double mixed refrigerant. The LNG plant has two LNG double-walled, storage tanks with a capacity of each. LNG is exported via an jetty in Aniva Bay. The jetty is fitted with four arms ‚Äì two loading arms, one dual purpose arm and one vapour return arm. The upper deck is designed for a road bed and electric cables. The lower deck is used for the LNG pipeline, communication lines and a footpath. LNG is pumped from the storage tanks into the parallel loading lines which are brought to the LNG jetty. At the jetty head, the pipelines are connected with the jetty's four loading arms. The water depth at the tail of the jetty is . The jetty will serve LNG tankers which have capacities of between . Loading operations are estimated to take from six to 16 hours, depending on vessel capacity. The jetty will be able to handle loading of around 160 LNG carriers per year. =Plans for Piltun-Astokhskoye-C platform= At the 9th meeting of the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel (December 2010) Sakhalin Energy provided some preliminary information on its plans for a major new development project in the Piltun-Astokh field, called South Piltun. This is likely to include construction and installation of a new platform, called PA-C, approximately halfway between the existing PA-A (Molikpaq) and PA-B platforms. Supply contracts Contracts for the supply of LNG have been signed with: *Ky≈´sh≈´ Electric Power Company: 0.5 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 24 years (June 2004) *Shell Eastern Trading Ltd: 37 million tonnes over a 20-year period (October 2004) *Tokyo Gas: 1.1 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 24 years (February 2005) *Toho Gas: 0.5 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 24 years (June 2005) *Korea Gas Corporation: 1.5 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 20 years (July 2005) *Hiroshima Gas Co. Ltd: 0.21 million tonnes per year ‚àí20 years (April 2006) *T≈çhoku Electric Power Company: 0.42 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 20 years (May 2006) *Osaka Gas: 0.20 million tonnes per annum ‚Äì 20 years (February 2007) *Ch≈´bu Electric Power Company: 0.5 million tonnes per year ‚Äì 15 years (August 2007) Consortium The projects is owned and operated by Sakhalin Energy. Shareholders of Sakhalin Energy are: * Gazprom Sakhalin Holdings B.V. (subsidiary of Gazprom) ‚Äì 50% plus 1 share * Shell Sakhalin Holdings B.V. (subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell) ‚Äì 27.5% minus 1 share * Mitsui Sakhalin Holdings B.V. (subsidiary of Mitsui)- 12.5% * Diamond Gas Sakhalin (subsidiary of Mitsubishi) ‚Äì 10% Financing Sakhalin Energy looked for finances from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. However, on 11 January 2007 EBRD withdrew its consideration of financing for Sakhalin-2, claiming that Gazprom's acquisition of the controlling stake of Sakhalin-2 resulted in a to the project making it is unfeasible for the EBRD to pursue the current project. Meanwhile, environmental organizations contend that Sakhalin II had \\"chronically and substantially violated EBRD's environmental policy\\". The consortium applied for nearly a billion dollars in financing from the public export credit agencies of the United States and the United Kingdom, but in early March 2008 these applications were withdrawn due to the drawn-out and uncertain decision making process] by these banks. However, environmental groups contend that the drawn-out process was due to the fact that the company failed to demonstrate compliance with these public banks' environmental policies. In June 2008 Sakhalin Energy signed Russia's largest project finance deal, securing a loan of US$5.3 billion from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation and a consortium of international banks. Japan Bank for International Cooperation provided $3.7 billion of the funds. In October 2009 Sakhalin Energy secured an additional $1.4 billion in project financing, bringing the total Phase 2 project financing up to $6.7 billion. The additional debt was provided by a consortium of international commercial banks and insured by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI), an Export Credit Agency owned by the Japanese government. Environmental impact In July 2005, a Russian court upheld the appeal of environmentalists who claimed in a petition that Sakhalin Energy's environmental impact assessment, was inadequate. Sakhalin Energy denied the claims and stated them as vague and inaccurate. The environmental and social concerns came to a head at the end of November 2005 when the chief executive of WWF, Robert Napier, said that it would have a \\"negative impact on Sakhalin's people and environment\\". The WWF asserted that Sakhalin-2 threatens marine life as well as potentially damaging the local communities in the region. Sakhalin Energy responded to the WWF's assertion by saying that the project meets lenders' policies and that environmental and social issues have been met. In September 2006, Sakhalin Energy briefly suspended construction work on its pipelines. Oleg Mitvol, the deputy chief of the Russian Federal Service for Natural Resources, had announced in early August 2006 that, according to his data, Sakhalin Energy failed to take all actions required to eliminate the danger of the mud flow. This was supported by President Vladimir Putin. For more than 20 years of operation Sakhalin Energy exercises industrial environmental control of its assets to ensure the compliance with legislation on environmental protection, to observe established environmental regulations, and to provide the rational use of natural resources and fulfilment of the plans for minimising the environmental impact. The company exercises industrial environmental control in the following areas: ‚Äì air emissions; ‚Äì water use and discharge; ‚Äì waste management. The company has developed and implements the Air Emissions and Energy Management Standard, Water Use Standard and Waste Management Standard. For more details see Sustainable Development Report =Gray whales= Western gray whale on Sakhalin One key concern from environmental groups is that the Sakhalin-2 project will harm the western gray whale population. The whales summer feeding grounds are close to the project's offshore platforms in the Sea of Okhotsk. In 2006, the International Union for Conservation of Nature set up the Western Gray Whale Advisory Panel (WGWAP). Its members are marine scientists who give independent advice to Sakhalin Energy about managing any potential risks to the western gray whales. The Russian Academy of Sciences has identified an increasing population of western gray whales in the Sea of Okhotsk during a photo identification research programme. However, in February 2009 the WGWAP issued an urgent warning that the number of western gray whales observed in the primary (near shore) feeding area had decreased and the panel called for a \\"...moratorium on all industrial activities, both maritime and terrestrial, that have the potential to disturb gray whales in summer and autumn on and near their main feeding areas.\\" In a meeting in April 2009, the WGWAP reiterated its urgent plea for a moratorium. Sakhalin Energy then agreed to suspend its planned summer 2009 seismic testing. The Far Eastern Regional Hydrometeorological Research Institute is involved in regular monitoring of the western gray whales near the oil and gas developments on the Sakhalin Shelf. In December 2008, Sakhalin Energy won the Environmental Project of the Year award. The company's protection of the western gray whale population was recognised in the Environmental Efficiency of Economics category. The award was presented by Yuri Trutnev, the Russian Federation's Natural Resources Minister. The population assessment in 2008 resulted in an estimate of 130 individuals in the western population. No new reproductive females were recorded in 2010, resulting in a minimum of 26 reproductive females being observed since 1995. Multiple seismic surveys were conducted near Sakhalin in 2010, carried out separately by Rosneft, Sakhalin Energy and Gazprom. The surveys conducted by Sakhalin Energy and Rosneft apparently had corresponding monitoring and mitigation plans. The monitoring data, including acoustic and visual information on whale distribution and behavior, is yet to be analyzed. Two of those seismic surveys occurred later in the year when more gray whales were present and temporally overlapped. Critically endangered North Pacific right whales are also present in the region.Shipulin 2012 –ê –¥–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ —è –≤–∞–º –∫–∏—Ç–æ–≤ –ø–æ–∫–∞–∂—É, –∞? . LiveJournal. retrieved on 9 June 2014 Sakhalin Energy in cooperation with Sakhalin-1 operator implementsthe integrated monitoring programme near the north-eastern coast of Sakhalin Island. It shows that the distribution of whales in feeding areas did not vary significantly during the whole period of the study; the number of individuals in the aggregation is increasing, and its reproduction rate is stable. A study was conducted to research the composition, distribution and variability of the communities of gray whale food organisms. =Salmon fishing= Other concerns are that the project will threaten the livelihood of tens of thousands of fishermen, destroy the key salmon fishing area off the island by dumping one million tons of dredging spoil waste into the sea, and imply a long-time threat of a large oil spill in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. Dredging of Aniva Bay was completed in 2005. In 2005 the salmon harvest was recorded as an all-time high of more than 134,000 tonnes. In 2007 this record was overturned with a salmon catch of 144,181 tonnes. Sakhalin Energy paid compensation of $110,000 to the Russian Federation to cover potential fish impacts from the Sakhalin-2 project. This compensation was paid regardless of whether any impact was recorded on the fishing industry or not. Part of these funds was used to set up thriving salmon hatcheries on Sakhalin Island. In 2007, the company started a programme to identify the taimen (a rare protected species of salmon) habitats in the river systems along the pipeline to ensure that production activity will not put the existence of this species at risk. At the first stage, the distribution and the number of young taimen in several rivers were studied. In 2011, a new phase was launched under the programme, based on the basin-oriented approach to the study of ichthyofauna, including the Sakhalin taimen. In 2017, ichthyological studies were carried out in the Val River basin. In the course of the work, 29 stations were completed in the main channel, eight ‚Äî in the tributaries of the river, and two ‚Äî in the adjoining lakes. In total, 19 species of fish from nine families were identified in the Val River, watercourses and reservoirs in its basin. The family of salmonids was represented by the largest number of species: all four species of the Pacific salmon (genus Oncorhynchus) reproducing in the rivers of Sakhalin, three species of the Arctic salmon of the genus Salvelinus, and the Sakhalin taimen. The family of cyprinids was represented by four species; the remaining families were represented by one species each. =Impacts on rivers and streams= According to the Sakhalin Environment Watch, the following environmental changes have occurred: *Pilenga River: Erosion control is visible on one bank but not on the other bank as of April 2006. *Mereya River: Active slope erosion and water pollution as of July 2005. *Woskresenkovka River: The clear river is threatened by the creation of a junction of two pipeline trenches filled with mud as of December 2005. *Golubichnaya River: Normally this river would not be frozen solid in winter but the digging of the trench has provoked the complete lack of river flow as of December 2005. *Bystraya River: The river ice is covered by soil as a result of the river crossing, which will result in additional contamination when the ice melts as of December 2005. *Stolichnyi stream: Ploughed-up channel of spawning stream and active erosion and silted processes as of August 2005. Nevertheless, these concerns were doubted. While preparing for work execution and during the construction, Sakhalin Energy conducted baseline studies and operational monitoring of all crossing areas of water bodies. For the operations phase, a comprehensive observation programme was developed to monitor the most environmentally significant and hydrographically complex water bodies, which allows the company to monitor any changes, to identify critical areas, to develop and take timely corrective measures. In 2017, the monitoring of hydrological and hydrochemical characteristics and condition of bottom sediments was implemented at 24 water bodies crossed by the pipelines, as well as in the area of potential impact from OPF at the Vatung River, and in the area of the Prigorodnoye production complex at the Mereya River and the Goluboy Brook. In the course of work under the special programme, at the request of oversight bodies, a study was conducted of the Nabil River (with a nameless tributary) and the Nayba River, whose under-river crossings were performed using the horizontal directional drilling (HDD) method. Monitoring was performed during three hydrological seasons: spring floods, summer low water and autumn high water. Sampling was carried out at two cross sections ‚Äî the upstream baseline (with no impact from the company's infrastructure assets) and downstream monitoring sections. On most investigated river- crossing sites (from the upstream to the downstream cross sections) no significant horizontal or vertical deformations of river beds were found. The crossings are in satisfactory condition, and no damage to utility lines was found. In 2017 the River Ecosystems Monitoring did not reveal surface water contamination with oil products. All measurement values were insignificant and in line with MAC standards.

These efforts may occur at the individual, relationship, community, and society level. Suicide is often preventable. Beyond direct interventions to stop an impending suicide, methods may include: * treating mental illness * improving coping strategies of people who are at risk * reducing risk factors for suicide, such as poverty and social vulnerability * giving people hope for a better life after current problems are resolved General efforts include measures within the realms of medicine, mental health, and public health. Because protective factors such as social support and social engagement‚Äîas well as environmental risk factors such as access to lethal means‚Äî play a role in suicide, suicide is not solely a medical or mental-health issue.Compare: Interventions Many methods have been developed to prevent suicide. The general methods include: direct talks, screening for risks, lethal means reduction and social intervention. Individuals with access to proper mental health care, a sense of belonging, good problem-solving skills, and a system of beliefs that discourages suicide are less likely to attempt suicide. =Lethal means reduction= Troms√∏ Bridge suicide prevention fence Means reduction ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†reducing the odds that a suicide attempter will use highly lethal means ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†is an important component of suicide prevention. This practice is also called \\"means restriction\\". It has been demonstrated that restricting lethal means can help reduce suicide rates, as delaying action until the desire to die has passed. In general, strong evidence supports the effectiveness of means restriction in preventing suicides. There is also strong evidence that restricted access at so-called suicide hotspots, such as bridges and cliffs, reduces suicides, whereas other interventions such as placing signs or increasing surveillance at these sites appears less effective. One of the most famous historical examples of means reduction is that of coal gas in the United Kingdom. Until the 1950s, the most common means of suicide in the UK was poisoning by gas inhalation. In 1958, natural gas (virtually free of carbon monoxide) was introduced, and over the next decade, comprised over 50% of gas used. As carbon monoxide in gas decreased, suicides also decreased. The decrease was driven entirely by dramatic decreases in the number of suicides by carbon monoxide poisoning. A 2020 Cochrane review on means restrictions for jumping found tentative evidence of reductions in frequency. In the United States, firearm access is associated with increased suicide completion. About 85% of attempts with a gun result in death while most other widely used suicide attempt methods result in death less than 5% of the time. Although restrictions on access to firearms have reduced firearm suicide rates in other countries, such restrictions are difficult in the United States because the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution limits restrictions on weapons. =Crises hotline= Crisis hotlines connect a person in distress to either a volunteer or staff member. This may occur via telephone, text messaging, online chat, or in person. Even though crisis hotlines are common, they have not been well studied. One study found a decrease in psychological pain, hopelessness, and desire to die from the beginning of the call through the next few weeks; however, the desire to die did not decrease long term. =Social intervention= In the United States, the 2012 National Strategy for Suicide Prevention promotes various specific suicide prevention efforts including: * Developing groups led by professionally trained individuals for broad-based support for suicide prevention. * Promoting community-based suicide prevention programs. * Screening and reducing at-risk behavior through psychological resilience programs that promotes optimism and connectedness. * Education about suicide, including risk factors, warning signs, stigma related issues and the availability of help through social campaigns. * Increasing the proficiency of health and welfare services at responding to people in need. e.g., Sponsored training for helping professionals, Increased access to community linkages, employing crisis counseling organizations. * Reducing domestic violence and substance abuse through legal and empowerment means are long-term strategies. * Reducing access to convenient means of suicide and methods of self-harm. e.g., toxic substances, poisons, handguns. * Reducing the quantity of dosages supplied in packages of non-prescription medicines e.g., aspirin. * School-based competency promoting and skill enhancing programs. * Interventions and usage of ethical surveillance systems targeted at high-risk groups. * Improving reporting and portrayals of negative behavior, suicidal behavior, mental illness and substance abuse in the entertainment and news media. * Research on protective factors & development of effective clinical and professional practices. =Media guidelines= Recommendations around media reporting of suicide include not sensationalizing the event or attributing it to a single cause. It is also recommended that media messages include suicide prevention messages such as stories of hope and links to further resources. Particular care is recommended when the person who died is famous. Specific details of the method or the location are not recommended. There; however, is little evidence regarding the benefit of providing resources for those looking for help and the evidence for media guidelines generally is mixed at best. TV shows and news media may also be able to help prevent suicide by linking suicide with negative outcomes such as pain for the person who has attempted suicide and their survivors, conveying that the majority of people choose something other than suicide in order to solve their problems, avoiding mentioning suicide epidemics, and avoiding presenting authorities or sympathetic, ordinary people as spokespersons for the reasonableness of suicide. =Medication= The medication lithium may be useful in certain situations to reduce the risk of suicide. Specifically it is effective at lowering the risk of suicide in those with bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder. =Counseling= There are multiple talk therapies that reduce suicidal thoughts and behaviors including dialectical behavior therapy (DBT).Canadian Agency for Drugs and technology in Health: \\"Dialectical Behaviour Therapy in Adolescents for Suicide Prevention: Systematic Review of Clinical-Effectiveness,\\" CADTH Technology Overviews, Volume 1, Issue 1, March 2010 National Institute of Mental Health: Suicide in the U.S.: Statistics and Prevention Cognitive behavior therapy for suicide prevention (CBT-SP) is a form of DBT adapted for adolescents at high risk for repeated suicide attempts. The brief intervention and contact technique developed by the World Health Organization also has shown benefit. The World Health Organization recommends \\"specific skills should be available in the education system to prevent bullying and violence in and around the school\\". =Coping planning= Coping planning is an strengths-based intervention that aims to meet the needs of people who ask for help, including those experiencing suicidal ideation. By addressing why someone asks for help, the risk assessment and management stays on what the person needs, and the needs assessment focuses on the individual needs of each person. The coping planning approach to suicide prevention draws on the health-focused theory of coping. Coping is normalized as a normal and universal human response to unpleasant emotions and interventions are considered a change continuum of low intensity (e.g. self-soothing) to high intensity support (e.g. professional help). By planning for coping, it supports people who are distressed and provides a sense of belongingness and resilience in treatment of illness. The proactive coping planning approach overcomes implications of ironic process theory.Wegner, Daniel M. (1989). White Bears and Other Unwanted Thoughts: Suppression, Obsession, and the Psychology of Mental Control. Viking Adult. The biopsychosocial strategy of training people in healthy coping improves emotional regulation and decreases memories of unpleasant emotions. A good coping planning strategically reduces the inattentional blindness for a person while developing resilience and regulation strengths. =Strategies= A United States Army suicide prevention poster The traditional approach has been to identify the risk factors that increase suicide or self-harm, though meta-analysis studies suggest that suicide risk assessment might not be useful and recommend immediate hospitalization of the person with suicidal feelings as the healthy choice. In 2001, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, published the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention, establishing a framework for suicide prevention in the U.S. The document, and its 2012 revision, calls for a public health approach to suicide prevention, focusing on identifying patterns of suicide and suicidal ideation throughout a group or population (as opposed to exploring the history and health conditions that could lead to suicide in a single individual). The ability to recognize warning signs of suicide allows individuals who may be concerned about someone they know to direct them to help. Suicide gesture and suicidal desire (a vague wish for death without any actual intent to kill oneself) are potentially self-injurious behaviors that a person may use to attain some other ends, like to seek help, punish others, or to receive attention. This behavior has the potential to aid an individual's capability for suicide and can be considered as a suicide warning, when the person shows intent through verbal and behavioral signs. Specific strategies Suicide prevention strategies focus on reducing the risk factors and intervening strategically to reduce the level of risk. Risk and protective factors, unique to the individual can be assessed by a qualified mental health professional. Some of the specific strategies used to address are: * Crisis intervention. * Structured counseling and psychotherapy. * Hospitalization for those with low adherence to collaboration for help and those who require monitoring & secondary symptom treatment. * Supportive therapy like substance abuse treatment, Psychotropic medication, Family psychoeducation and Access to emergency phone call care with emergency rooms, suicide prevention hotlines, etc. * Restricting access to lethality of suicide means through policies and laws. * Creating & using crisis cards, an uncluttered card formatted readably that describes a list of activities one should follow in crisis until the positive behavior responses settles in the personality. * Person-centered life skills training. e.g., Problem solving. * Registering with support groups like Alcoholics Anonymous, Suicide Bereavement Support Group, a religious group with flow rituals, etc. * Therapeutic recreational therapy that improves mood. * Motivating self-care activities like physical exercise's and meditative relaxation. Psychotherapies that have shown most successful or evidence based are dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which has shown to be helpful in reducing suicide attempts and reducing hospitalizations for suicidal ideationLinehan et al., 2006 and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which has shown to improve problem-solving and coping abilities.Stellrecht et al., 2006 =After a suicide= Postvention is for people affected by an individual's suicide. This intervention facilitates grieving, guides to reduce guilt, anxiety, and depression and to decrease the effects of trauma. Bereavement is ruled out and promoted for catharsis and supporting their adaptive capacities before intervening depression and any psychiatric disorders. Postvention is also provided to minimize the risk of imitative or copycat suicides, but there is a lack of evidence based standard protocol. But the general goal of the mental health practitioner is to decrease the likelihood of others identifying with the suicidal behavior of the deceased as a coping strategy in dealing with adversity.  Risk assessment  A photo illustration produced by the Defense Media Agency on suicide prevention Warning signs of suicide can allow individuals to direct people who may be considering suicide to get help. Behaviors that may be warning signs include: # Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill themselves # Suicidal ideation: thinking, talking, or writing about suicide, planning for suicide # Substance abuse # Feelings of purposelessness # Anxiety, agitation, being unable to sleep, or sleeping all the time # Feelings of being trapped # Feelings of hopelessness # Social withdrawal # Displaying extreme mood swings, suddenly changing from sad to very calm or happy # Recklessness or impulsiveness, taking risks that could lead to death, such as driving extremely fast # Mood changes including depression # Feelings of uselessness # Settling outstanding affairs, giving away prized or valuable possessions, or making amends when they are otherwise not expected to die (as an example, this behavior would be typical in a terminal cancer patient but not a healthy young adult) # strong feelings of pain, either emotional or physical considering oneself burdensome # increased use of drugs or alcohol Additionally, the National Institute for Mental Health includes feeling burdensome, and strong feelings of pain‚Äîeither emotional or physical‚Äîas warning signs that someone may attempt suicide. = Direct talks = An effective way to assess suicidal thoughts is to talk with the person directly, to ask about depression, and assess suicide plans as to how and when it might be attempted.\\"Preventing Suicide ‚Äì A Resource for Primary Health Care Workers\\" (PDF), World Health Organization, Geneva, 2000, p. 13. Contrary to popular misconceptions, talking with people about suicide does not plant the idea in their heads. However, such discussions and questions should be asked with care, concern and compassion. The tactic is to reduce sadness and provide assurance that other people care. The WHO advises to not say everything will be all right nor make the problem seem trivial, nor give false assurances about serious issues. The discussions should be gradual and specifically executed when the person is comfortable about discussing their feelings. ICARE (Identify the thought, Connect with it, Assess evidences for it, Restructure the thought in positive light, Express or provide room for expressing feelings from the restructured thought) is a model of approach used here. = Screening = The U.S. Surgeon General has suggested that screening to detect those at risk of suicide may be one of the most effective means of preventing suicide in children and adolescents.Office of the Surgeon General:The Surgeon General's Call To Action To Prevent Suicide 1999 There are various screening tools in the form of self-report questionnaires to help identify those at risk such as the Beck Hopelessness Scale and Is Path Warm?. A number of these self- report questionnaires have been tested and found to be effective for use among adolescents and young adults.Rory C. O'Connor, Stephen Platt, Jacki Gordon: International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy and Practice, p. 510 There is however a high rate of false-positive identification and those deemed to be at risk should ideally have a follow-up clinical interview.Rory C. O'Connor, Stephen Platt, Jacki Gordon, International Handbook of Suicide Prevention: Research, Policy and Practice, p.361; Wiley- Blackwell (2011), The predictive quality of these screening questionnaires has not been conclusively validated so it is not possible to determine if those identified at risk of suicide will actually die by suicide.Alan F. Schatzberg: The American Psychiatric Publishing textbook of mood disorders, p. 503: American Psychiatric Publishing; (2005) Asking about or screening for suicide does not create or increase the risk. In approximately 75 percent of completed suicides, the individuals had seen a physician within the year before their death, including 45 to 66 percent within the prior month. Approximately 33 to 41 percent of those who completed suicide had contact with mental health services in the prior year, including 20 percent within the prior month. These studies suggest an increased need for effective screening. Many suicide risk assessment measures are not sufficiently validated, and do not include all three core suicidality attributes (i.e., suicidal affect, behavior, and cognition). A study published by the University of New South Wales has concluded that asking about suicidal thoughts cannot be used as a reliable predictor of suicide risk. = Underlying condition = The conservative estimate is that 10% of individuals with psychiatric disorders may have an undiagnosed medical condition causing their symptoms, with some estimates stating that upwards of 50% may have an undiagnosed medical condition which if not causing is exacerbating their psychiatric symptoms.Chuang L., Mental Disorders Secondary to General Medical Conditions; Medscape;2011 Illegal drugs and prescribed medications may also produce psychiatric symptoms. Effective diagnosis and if necessary medical testing which may include neuroimagingAndreas P. Otte, Kurt Audenaert, Kathelijne Peremans, Nuclear Medicine in Psychiatry: Functional Imaging of Suicidal Behavior, pp.475‚Äì483, Springer (2004); to diagnose and treat any such medical conditions or medication side effects may reduce the risk of suicidal ideation as a result of psychiatric symptoms, most often including depression, which are present in up to 90‚Äì95% of cases.Patricia D. Barry, Suzette Farmer; Mental health & mental illness, p. 282, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins;(2002) =Risk factors= All people can be at risk of suicide. Risk factors that contribute to someone feeling suicidal or making a suicide attempt may include: *Depression, other mental disorders, or substance abuse disorder *Certain medical conditions *Chronic pain *A prior suicide attempt *Family history of a mental disorder or substance abuse *Family history of suicide *Family violence, including physical or sexual abuse *Having guns or other firearms in the home *Having recently been released from prison or jail *Being exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as that of family members, peers, or celebrities Support organizations Sign promoting Samaritans near a payphone in the United Kingdom A sign at a railroad crossing in the Netherlands promoting a suicide crisis line (113) Many non-profit organizations exist, such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in the United States, which serve as crisis hotlines; it has benefited from at least one crowd-sourced campaign. The first documented program aimed at preventing suicide was initiated in 1906 in both New York, the National Save- A-Life League and in London, the Suicide Prevention Department of the Salvation Army.Bertolote, 2004 Suicide prevention interventions fall into two broad categories: prevention targeted at the level of the individual and prevention targeted at the level of the population. To identify, review, and disseminate information about best practices to address specific objectives of the National Strategy Best Practices Registry (BPR) was initiated. The Best Practices Registry of Suicide Prevention Resource Center is a registry of various suicide intervention programs maintained by the American Association of Suicide Prevention. The programs are divided, with those in Section I listing evidence-based programs: interventions which have been subjected to in depth review and for which evidence has demonstrated positive outcomes. Section III programs have been subjected to review.Best Practices Registry (BPR) For Suicide Prevention If you or someone you know displays sign or symptoms of suicidal thoughts or actions these prevention organizations are available: *Befrienders Worldwide * American Foundation for Suicide Prevention * Campaign Against Living Miserably * Crisis Text Line * International Association for Suicide Prevention * Jed Foundation * National Suicide Prevention Lifeline * Samaritans (charity) * SOSAD Ireland * Suicide Prevention Action Network USA * The Trevor Project * Trans Lifeline Economics In the United States it is estimated that an episode of suicide results in costs of about $1.3 million. Money spending on appropriated interventions is estimated to result in a decrease in economic losses that are 2.5 fold greater than the amount spent.

Personal life  While no date of birth survives for Torroja; he was very old at his death, being in excess of 70 years when he was elected as Grand Master. He had served in the order for many years and was the Templar Master in both Crown of Aragon and Provence.  Biography  Arnau de Torroja, brother of the Archbishop of Tarragona Guillem de Torroja, is Grand Master of the crown of Aragon and Provence when he is elected head of the Order in late 1180, to succeed Eudes de Saint-Amand, who died in captivity in Damascus. At that time Arnau de Torroja is over 58 years old, therefore he is a seasoned man in the discipline and in the operation of the Order. Essentially dedicated to the Reconquest of Spain, Arnaldo de Torroja does not know, or does not know it well, the political situation of the Latin States of the East. His stage of government is marked by the quarrels that are fought between Templars and Hospitallers, since the latter do not cease to increase their influence and their political power. Arnau de Torroja accepts the mediation of Pope Lucio III and Balduino IV to end these fratricidal struggles. In 1184, the political situation degenerated further, when Reinaldo de Ch√¢tillon aided by the Templars and Hospitallers, devastated the Muslim territories of Transjordan on his own. Arnaldo de Torroja will give evidence of a great political sagacity when negotiating a truce with Saladino, who is determined to avenge the incursions of Renaud de Ch√¢tillon.http://www.armand.cat/templers/2018/11/09/trobades-les-possibles- restes-de-fra-arnau-de-torroja-el-gran-mestre-catala-del-temple/  Military Record  = Reconquista = Torroja's military career had mainly been focused on the Reconquista, fighting Muslims for the Crown of Aragon and for Portugal but was principally active in Catalonia and Aragon. His appointment as Grand Master was likely due to his image as an outsider i.e. an experienced Templar whose power base was outside the Holy Land. This appealed to the order as the previous Grand Master Odo de St Amand had become embroiled in Jerusalem's politics but it did mean that Torroja was inexperienced in the \\"political situation of the Latin States\\". He became the order's new leader in 1181. = Conflict with the Hospitallers = During the Grand Master's reign the Knights Hospitaller reached a new peak in their influence. There had been rivalry between orders previously but factionalism in the face of renewed Muslim pressure was unacceptable. The two Grand Masters met for mediation with Pope Lucius III and King Baldwin IV and the problems were resolved. In fact Torroja is recorded as a skilled diplomat himself acting as a mediator between several political groups in the East. He also conducted successful peace negotiations with Saladin after raids by Raynald of Ch√¢tillon in Transjordan. = Embassy to Europe = In 1184, Torroja set out with Patriarch Heraclius and Grand Master Roger de Moulins of the Knights Hospitaller to gather European support for the Kingdom of Jerusalem. They planned to visit Italy, England and France, but he fell ill and died at Verona on September 30, 1184. He was succeeded as Grand Master by G√©rard de Ridefort. = Tomb = In February 2018 was announced the discovery of a tomb in the San Fermo Maggiore church in Verona, which almost certainly is Arnold's final resting place. The tomb contained a stone sarcophagus with a cross patt√©e carved on it, itself containing a human body, and several analysis conducted by researchers of the Universities of Verona, Bologna and Nottingham together would confirm the identity of the deceased; it would be the first known tomb of a Templar Grand Master. From preliminary analysis, the remains are those of a man in his fifties who lived around seven centuries ago, and who suffered from back pain and toothache. Along with the bones, remains of a dress of fine silk datable to the 12th century, as well as what looks like a shroud, further support the identification. The DNA from the bones will be compared with that of Arnold's brother, the then archbishop of Tarragona, Guillermo de Torroja.

Purushothaman left The NewsMarket operating team in New York in September 2009 upon the completion of its acquisition of NASDAQ-listed Medialink. The company was subsequently re- branded as Synaptic Digital and was acquired in 2012. Purushothaman served on its Board until its 2012 acquisition. Since 2012, Purushothaman has worked on entrepreneurial ventures which seek to disrupt the corporate training sector with technology-led learning focused on behavioral skill development. Purushothaman and her co-founder Anthony Hayward are targeting the fact that 66% of the world's labor pool today is in emerging markets. This 2.1B large workforce provides opportunities for skills training that leverages technology to scale. In 2013, Purushothaman was chosen as one of 15 fellows globally for the inaugural \\"On the Board\\" fellow by George Washington University. The fellowship, offered in conjunction with the International Women's Forum, trains women to serve on the boards of major corporations. In 2016, Purushothaman co-founded Hardskills with Anthony Hayward and Krish Menon to translate their early vision of a technology-led solution to training behavioral skills such as critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and decision-making. Hardskills operates out of the twin hubs of Singapore and Berlin. In 2019, Hardskills and Purushothaman were selected to participate in SAP.io's No Boundaries start-up accelerator in Berlin that aims to help business-to-business start-ups to scale.

The lake's salinity levels have increased dramatically as the lake level has dropped in recent decades. It is Australia's largest permanent saline lake, covering approximately with a circumference of . It forms part of the Ramsar-listed Western District Lakes wetland site. The indigenous name of the lake is recorded as Kronimite.Native names of hills, rivers, lakes, and other natural features in Victoria Physical features and hydrology The waterbody is surrounded to the south and east by rocky outcrops (known locally as the stony rises) which were formed by lava flows from Mount Porndon to the south-west and Mount Warrion to the east. The Red Rock volcanic complex overlooks the south east shore at Alvie. The Mount Warrion flows caused the lake to form by blocking drainage to the east. As is typical of lakes in the area, the eastern flanks of the lake consist of lunettes formed by wind borne sediments blown from the lake during periods with dry climates. Flow into the lake is extremely variable and negligible in the driest years. Currently it is endorheic (there is no outflow) but during the wet decade of the 1950s the lake flooded and became connected via a series of wetlands and lakes to Lake Murdeduke and the Barwon River. It has never been completely dry since European settlement, and there it is evidence it was an open lake for centuries prior to the 1840s when rainfall and runoff were similar to those of the 1950s. The main inflows are from Pirron Yaloak Creek flowing from the Otway plains to the south, the Woady Yaloak River flowing from the flanks of the Victorian Midlands to the north, and Salt Creek flowing from the plains to the north-west. The Pirron Yaloak has high nutrient loads due to dairy farming in its catchment. In response to the floods of the 1950s, the Woady Yaloak was diverted away from Lake Corangamite and into the Barwon River. The diversion is managed on the basis of a trigger level for the lake, above which the diversion is enacted. This has not occurred in recent years. Levels have been dropping for decades and it is possible that it will dry completely. In 1980 the salinity was approximately that of seawater and has since risen at least four times that of seawater. Fauna =Fish= Aquatic fauna once included fish species such as short-finned eel, common galaxias, flat-headed gudgeon and small-mouth hardyhead. These may still survive in refuges such as Pirron Yaloak creek and various freshwater springs flowing from the stony rises on the south west side of the lake. Springs on the south east side have dried - possibly due to over exploitation of the Warrion Aquifer for irrigation. More recently the fauna included brine shrimp and a species of isopod. =Birds= In the past the lake has supported internationally significant numbers of banded stilts. The lake was previously an important breeding site for waterbirds. Most recently pelican colonies occurred at Wool Wool rocks and Vaughan Island. However, as water levels have dropped, prey have disappeared and foxes have gained access to the colonies, which have now been abandoned. After receiving substantial grants from the government to undertake conservation works, the owner of Vaugn Island used earth moving equipment to remove habitat such as rocks and remnant vegetation. The lake forms part of the Lake Corangamite Complex Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because it sometimes supports globally important numbers of waterbirds.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Lake Corangamite Complex. Downloaded from http://www.birdlife.org on 2011-07-19. World War II aircraft A crashed World War II RAAF Wirraway was discovered in June 2005 in Lake Corangamite. Heritage Victoria protects all aircraft crash sites over 50 years old as historic archaeological sites, and the RAAF was briefed on the find. The site was recently exposed by receding water levels in the lake and reported by Parks Victoria officers to Heritage Victoria. The site appears intact and remains mostly submerged. The plane is believed to be Wirraway A20-406, which crashed into Lake Corangamite, from shore, on 17 March 1943.

She lived much of her later life in the bohemian area of Kings Cross, Sydney, leading her to be termed the \\"Witch of Kings Cross\\" in some of the tabloids,Drury 2009. p. 07. and from where she led her own coven of Witches. Her paintings, which have been compared to those of British occult artist Austin Osman Spare,Drury 2009. p. 207. often depicted images of supernatural entities such as pagan gods and demons, sometimes involved in sexual acts. These caused particular controversy in Australia during the 1940s and 50s, when the country \\"was both socially and politically conservative\\" with Christianity as the dominant faith and at a time when the government \\"promoted a harsh stance on censorship.\\"Drury 2009. p. 07. For this reason the authorities dealt with her work harshly, with the police removing some of her work from exhibitions, confiscating books that contained her images, and attempting to prosecute her for public obscenity on a number of occasions. According to her later biographer, Nevill Drury, \\"Norton's esoteric beliefs, cosmology and visionary art are all closely intertwined ‚Äì and reflect her unique approach to the magical universe.\\" She was inspired by \\"the 'night' side of magic\\", emphasising darkness and studying the Qliphoth, alongside forms of sex magic which she had learned from the writings of English occultist Aleister Crowley.Drury 2009. p. 08. Biography =Early life: 1917‚Äì1934= Norton was born in Dunedin, during a thunderstorm at about 4:30 in the morning, to an English middle class, Anglican family who had moved to the country a number of years before. She was the third of three sisters and her siblings, CecilyDrury. 1988, p. vii. and Phyllis, were each over a decade older than her. In later life, she would claim that she had been born a Witch, with certain biological features to mark her out as such, including pointed ears, blue markings on her left knee and a strand of flesh that hung on her body.Drury 2009. pp. 9-13. When she herself was eight, in June 1925, her family emigrated to Sydney. There they settled in Wolseley Street, in the wealthy northern suburb of Lindfield. As a child, Rosaleen never liked being conventional, and disliked most other children, as well as authority figures, including her mother Beena, with whom her relationship was very strained. Her father Albert, who was a sailor, was regularly away from home, although provided enough of an income so that the Nortons were able to live comfortably.Drury 2009. pp. 13-14. Nonetheless, she would later describe her life at this time as being \\"a generally wearisome period of senseless shibboleths, prying adults, detestable or depressing children whom I was supposed to like, and parental reproaches.\\"Drury 2009. pp. 14-15. Due to this, she kept herself to herself, sleeping not in the house, but in a tent which she pitched in the garden for three years, and kept a pet spider at the entrance which she named Horatius, as well as other pets including cats, lizards, tortoises, toads, dogs and a goat.Drury 2009. p. 15. Norton was enrolled at a Church of England girls' school, where she was eventually expelled for being disruptive and drawing images of demons, vampires and other such beings which the teachers claimed had a corrupting influence on other pupils. She subsequently began attending East Sydney Technical College, studying art under the sculptor Rayner Hoff, a man who encouraged her artistic talent and whom she greatly admired.Drury 2009. pp. 15-16. =Early career: 1935‚Äì1948= Norton, quoted in Drury 2009. p. 157. Following her art college studies, Norton set herself up to become a professional writer, with the newspaper Smith's Weekly publishing a number of her horror stories in 1934, when she was sixteen, after which they gave her the job as a cadet journalist and then as an illustrator. However, her graphic illustrations were deemed too controversial, and she lost her job at the paper.Drury 2009. pp. 16-18. Leaving Smith's Weekly, Norton moved out of her family home following the death of her mother, and sought employment as an artists' model, working for such painters as Norman Lindsay. To supplement this income, she also took up other forms of work, including as a hospital's kitchen maid, a waitress and a toy designer. Meanwhile, she had taken up a room in the Ship and Mermaid Inn, which overlooked Circular Quay, Sydney, where she began reading various books on the subject of the Western Esoteric Tradition, including those on demonology, the Qabalah and comparative religion.Drury 2009. pp. 18-19. In 1935, Rosaleen met a man named Beresford Lionel Conroy and they married on 14 December 1940, before going on a hitch- hiking trip across Australia, from Sydney to Melbourne, and on through to Brisbane and Cairns. Returning to Sydney, Conroy enlisted as a commando and went off to serve in New Guinea during the Second World War, and upon his return, Norton, who had been forced to live in a stable during this period, demanded a divorce, which was finally settled in 1951. During their marriage, the couple lived at 46 Bayswater Road, Kings Cross in 1943.Australian Electoral Roll electorate of East Sydney. Now single once more, Norton took up residence in a boarding house known as the Merangaroo in the Rocks area, which she enjoyed for its \\"eccentric, communal living.\\"Drury 2009. p. 19. She began looking for illustration work once more, being employed by a monthly free- thinking magazine known as Pertinent, which had been founded in 1940 and which was edited by the poet Leon Batt. Batt admired Norton's work, which was being increasingly influenced by pagan themes, describing her as \\"an artist worthy of comparison with some of the best Continental, American and English contemporaries.\\"Batt, quoted in Drury 2009. pp. 19-21. Norton contributed poetry and a cover illustration to Batt's anthology Not for Fools: A Collection of Pertinent Verse (1941). =Gavin Greenlees and the Melbourne exhibition: 1949‚Äì1950= It was at Pertinent that she met a younger man named Gavin Greenlees (1930‚Äì1983). Greenlees had grown up in a middle-class family where he had developed an early interest in surrealism, and had become a relatively successful poet, having his work published in such newspapers as ABC Weekly and Australia Monthly. By mid-1949, the two had become good friends, and hitchhiked together to Melbourne, searching for a venue where Norton could hold an exhibition of her art. They settled on the University of Melbourne's Rowden White Library, where forty-six of her paintings, including Timeless Worlds, Merlin, Lucifer and The Initiate were put on public exhibition.Drury 2009. pp. 21-23. However, the exhibition did not go well, and only two days after it had opened, police officers had surveyed the gallery and removed four paintings ‚Äì Witches' Sabbath, Lucifer, Triumph and Individuation ‚Äì which they deemed to be obscene. Norton was subsequently charged under the Police Offences Act of 1928. At the court case, held in Melbourne's Carlton Court, she was defended by A.L. Abrahams, who argued that the images in the recently published The History of Sexual Magic, a book that the Australian censors permitted, were of a far more obscene nature than Norton's paintings. She won the case, and was awarded ¬£4/4/- in compensation from the police department.Drury 2009. pp. 23-24. =Kings Cross and Walter Glover: 1951‚Äì1954= With the legal hassle in Melbourne over, Norton and Greenlees (who had become lovers), returned to Sydney, where they moved into the house at 179 Brougham Street. This was in the area known as Kings Cross, which at the time was renowned for being a red light district and for housing many of those living bohemian lifestyles, particularly artists, writers and poets. Here Norton associated with many of the locals, including Dulcie Deamer, the \\"Queen of Bohemia\\", whose book of poetry, The Silver Branch, included one of Norton's pictures. Several of the local cafes in the area, such as the Arabian, the Apollyon and the Kashmir, displayed some of her artworks, and she became a relatively well known figure in Kings Cross.Drury 2009. pp. 24-25. Norton's The Seance. Increasingly, many curious visitors came to see Norton and Greenlees at their home, which she had decorated with her own occult murals and a placard on the door stating \\"Welcome to the house of ghosts, goblins, werewolves, vampires, witches, wizards and poltergeists.\\" The couple, widely seen as local eccentrics, even befriended several sympathetic police officers, although nonetheless, many in the police force disapproved of their activities, and searched for criminal charges that could be levelled at them. In September 1951, they arrested Norton and Greenlees, accusing them of vagrancy (an accusation that could be levelled at anyone without a steady job, whether or not they were actually committing vagrancy). However, a publisher, Walter Glover (1911‚Äì) came to their aid, offering them employment as his assistants. After seeing examples of the pair's work, he then decided to publish a book containing a combination of Norton's artwork and Greenlees' poetry.Drury 2009. pp. 26-28. The result was published as The Art of Rosaleen Norton in 1952, and contained such paintings as Black Magic, Rites of Baron Samedi and an image depicting the horned demon Fohat, with a snake for his phallus, whilst Greenlees' poems featured in the work included The Angel of Twizzari and Esoteric Study.Drury 2009. p. 29. Restricted to a limited edition of 500 copies, The Art of Rosaleen Norton had been produced to a high quality, with each edition being bound in red leather with gold blocking, illustrated endpapers, and ribbon marker. It contained thirty-one black and white reproductions of artworks by Norton (twenty-nine of which were full-page or near full-page plates). This work was banned in N.S.W. (Australia) on the grounds of obscenity, and subsequently its import into the USA was forbidden. The publisher, Walter Glover, had intended an edition of 1000 copies (so stated in the book), six hundred and fifty to be bound in cloth (ordinary edition) and three-hundred and fifty in leather (the edition deluxe), with the first twenty copies of the leather edition to include a colour artwork by Norton. Only a small number - probably less than 20 - were issued in leather due to the prohibitive cost and it is also certain that far fewer than the intended 650 copies were bound in cloth, although the exact number that were distributed is unknown. Copies numbered up to 505 are known to exist. The book caused a great deal of controversy upon its release, and Glover was charged by police with the production of an obscene publication, with Norton being called into court to explain the nature of her works. The judge ruled that two of the images in the book, The Adversary and Fohat, did qualify as being obscene under Australian law, and that they had to be removed from all existing copies of the book. Glover \\"blacked out\\" the two \\"obscene\\" plates in a few copies, but most were unaltered. The authorities in the United States were even stricter, and customs actively destroyed any copies of the book that were imported into their country. The controversy had helped gain publicity for Norton's work, although the whole affair had bankrupted Glover, and the book's binder Alan Cross, realising that he would never get paid, was instead given his pick of Norton's work, for which he chose Fohat.Drury 2009. pp. 34-38. =Tabloid sensationalism and Sir Eugene Goossens: 1955‚Äì1959= In 1955, a mentally ill adolescent vagrant named Anna Karina Hoffman swore at a police officer, and was subsequently charged, but at her trial claimed that her life had fallen apart after taking part in a Satanic Black Mass run by Rosaleen Norton, a claim which was picked up in by the sensationalist tabloids. Norton, who did not consider herself to be a Satanist but a pagan, denied these claims, and indeed Hoffman later admitted that she had made them up. However, by this time, the press had picked up on the idea of Norton as a devil worshipper, and spun stories around the idea, for instance claiming that she committed animal sacrifice, a practice which in reality Norton abhorred.Drury 2009. pp. 38-40. With this public outcry against her work, the police once more began to act against her and those who supported her. In 1955, they successfully took the proprietor of a local restaurant, the Kashmir, to court, for displaying some of her works publicly. That same year, the police raided Norton and Greenlees' home, and accused them of performing \\"an unnatural sexual act\\", evidence for which they had obtained in a photograph displaying Greenlees in ritual garb flagellating Norton's buttocks. It was subsequently revealed that the photos had been taken at Norton's birthday party, and stolen by two members of their coven, Francis Honer and Raymond Ager, who planned to sell it to The Sun newspaper for ¬£200.Drury 2009. pp. 40-41. Meanwhile, the successful English classical music composer and conductor Sir Eugene Goossens (1893‚Äì1962), who was then in Australia and who had an interest in the occult, read a copy of The Art of Rosaleen Norton and decided to write to the artist herself. She invited him to meet her, and the two, alongside Gavin Greenlees, became friends and lovers. In March 1956, Goossens was arrested attempting to bring 800 erotic photographs, some film and ritual masks into Australia from London, and was charged under Section 233 of the Customs Act. In court, he pleaded guilty to bringing \\"blasphemous, indecent or obscene works\\" into the country and was fined ¬£100. He resigned his positions at both the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and New South Wales Conservatorium of Music and returned to Britain, his international career ending in disgrace. Norton's relationship with Goossens ended. Soon the life that Norton had held with Greenlees also collapsed, as he was admitted to Callan Park Hospital in 1955. In 1957 he was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Norton would continue to visit and support him, and in 1964 he was let off on temporary release, but suffered a schizophrenic attack and attempted to kill Norton with a knife before being re-admitted. He would only be discharged permanently in 1983, approximately four years after her death.Drury 2009. pp. 41-44. =Later life: 1960‚Äì1979= Rosaleen Norton plaque, Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross The tabloid attention surrounding Norton had intensified in the late 1950s, leading tourists to come into the area in search of her. Despite the fact that at the time witchcraft was still illegal in New South Wales (the British Witchcraft Act of 1735 had been repealed in England in 1951, but would only be repealed in New South Wales in 1971), Norton openly declared herself to be a Witch. She tried to explain her beliefs to interviewers, emphasising her faith in pantheism. Along with selling her paintings, she was also making charms and casting hexes for people, using witchcraft to supplement her income.Drury 2009. pp. 43-44. For a short period, Norton moved in to live with her sister Cecily, one of the few family members whom she got on well with, at her flat in Kirribilli, although in 1967 moved back to Kings Cross, taking up residence in a derelict house in Bourke Street, Darlinghurst. She later moved into a block of flats in Roslyn Gardens, Elizabeth Bay, accompanied by her pets. Here she began to live a more reclusive and private existence, avoiding the media attention of previous decades.Drury 2009. pp. 45-48. Norton died in 1979 from colon cancer at the Sacred Heart Hospice for the Dying, in Darlinghurst, Sydney, still worshipping Pan; a pagan until her death. Shortly before she died she is reported as saying: \\"I came into the world bravely; I'll go out bravely.\\" A plaque dedicated to her has since been installed in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross. Legacy Following her death, Norton's many paintings, which were owned by Don Deaton, a local printer and pub owner, were sold at auction to a single collector, Jack Parker, for ¬£5000, who displayed them at his Southern Cross Hotel in St Peters, Sydney. Meanwhile, Walter Glover gained the rights to republish The Art of Rosaleen Norton, re-releasing it in a facsimile edition in 1982 with a new introduction by Nevill Drury and four colour plates that did not appear in the first edition. There was an 'edition deluxe' of the 1982 reprint, housed in an ivory slipcase and signed by the publisher; approximately 50 copies of this were printed. Following this, in 1984, he published A Supplement to the Art of Rosaleen Norton, which contained colour prints of nineteen of the works which had been featured in her 1949 Melbourne exhibition.Drury 2009. p. 50-51. In December 1982, a play opened at the Tom Mann Theatre in Sydney entitled Rosaleen ‚Äì Wicked Witch of the Cross, by Barry Lowe. It starred Jane Parker as Norton, Peter Laurence as Glover, Christopher Lyons as Greenlees and Alan Archer as Pan, and was attended by both Wally Glover and Gavin Greenlees themselves. However, according to Nevill Drury, who was invited to the show by Glover, \\"the play itself had most of the weaknesses of an amateur production ‚Äì it was unconvincingly acted and was not acclaimed a critical success.\\"Drury 2009. p. 52. In 1988, the anthropologist Nevill Drury, who had published a number of books on the subject of witchcraft and magic, released a biography of Norton entitled Pan's Daughter: The Strange World of Rosaleen Norton. This volume was subsequently re-released under the title The Witch of Kings Cross. He later \\"substantially expanded and reworked\\" this into a new book titled Homage to Pan: The Life, Art and Sex-Magic of Rosaleen Norton, which was published in 2009.Drury 2009. p. 04. Drury had himself met her only on one occasion, at her apartment in 1977, at a time when she had become somewhat of a recluse.Drury 2009. p. 08. In 2000, an exhibition of Norton's paintings was held in Kings Cross, Sydney, organised by various enthusiasts including Keith Richmond, and Barry William Hale of the Australian Ordo Templi Orientis. A full-colour catalogue, The Occult Visions of Rosaleen Norton was published to accompany this exhibition. In 2009, Teitan Press published Thorn in the Flesh: A Grim-memoir by Norton, with an introduction by Australian Norton scholar Keith Richmond. The volume comprises poetry (often humorous), reminiscences, and various occult jottings by Rosaleen Norton, with reproductions of two stunning photographs of Norton, as well as some half-a- dozen examples of her art (mainly in color).THORN IN THE FLESH ‚Äì A GRIM- MEMOIRE In 2012 Norton's work was including in the major exhibition, \\"Windows to the Sacred\\" curated by Robert Buratti, which toured a number of Australian museums until 2016. The exhibition drew together drawings and paintings alongside work by Aleister Crowley, Austin Osman Spare, surrealist James Gleeson and many others. In 2013 the Teitan Press issued the first US edition of The Art of Rosaleen Norton, an edition which includes a 40-page introduction by Norton scholar Keith Richmond. Richmond is working on a full- length biography of Norton. In 2017 an exhibition of Norton's artwork was exhibited as part of \\"Occulture: The Dark Arts\\" at City Gallery Wellington, New Zealand curated by Robert Buratti and Aaron Lister. This was the first major showing of the artist in her country of birth. Several filmmakers have expressed interest in making films about Norton's life. In a 1993 interview given to Black and White magazine, Kenneth Anger said that he was putting finishing touches to a film treatment he had written about Norton's life.\\"The Compleat Anger,\\" Black and White No 2 (August 1993), 34-37, 110 This project was unrealised. More recently, Australian filmmaker Sonia Bible has been working for several years on a documentary about Norton, which will feature interviews with many living people who knew the artist. Personal life Although her two main sexual relationships in her life were with men (Gavin Greenlees and Sir Eugene Goossens respectively), Norton was bisexual, and allegedly enjoyed all forms of sexual activity with both men and women, including bondage and sado-masochism. She was also known to enjoy sexual intercourse with gay men, believing that in such situations she could play the active role. She also actively engaged in sex magic amongst her coven, having learned much about it from the writings of Aleister Crowley and from Goossens, who himself had been very much interested in Crowley's work.Drury 2009. p. 157-166. =Religious beliefs= Norton devised her own variety of neopagan witchcraft, establishing a Wicca tradition that according to English witch Doreen Valiente became known as \\"The Goat Fold\\".Valiente 1989. p. 156.

Personal life St Amand was born to a family from Limousin, France. He was Marshal of Jerusalem and later Viscount. He was a headstrong leader of the order, which earned him praise and resentment in equal measure. An example of this can be found 1172. When a Templar knight, Gauthier du Maisnil, was accused of murdering an Assassin dignitary to king Amalric I of Jerusalem, St. Amand refused to hand him over. He cited the Papal Bull which stipulated the only power over the Templars was Rome. Military career St. Amand took part in several expeditions during his time as Grand Master. He spearheaded military action in Naplouse, Jericho and Djerach, scoring considerable victories with the Templars. Perhaps his finest hour was at the battle of Montgisard, where his knights convincingly defeated a superior detachment of Saladin's army. In March 1179, St Amand oversaw the construction of the Chastellet fortress. Its position and impregnability made it a thorn in Saladin's side and he offered considerable amounts of money to have it destroyed. It was so effective that Saladin's May assault on Jerusalem in 1179 was defeated. His forces broke on the fortress's thick walls, and the fierce fighting of the Templars stationed there scored heavy losses on the Muslims. Trying to capitalize on the victory, an assault on the Islamic forces was organized at the Battle of Marj Ayun in 1179. It was spearheaded by King Baldwin IV, Raymond III of Tripoli, Odo de St Amand and Roger de Moulins. However, Saladin had regrouped and decimated the Christian forces. Baldwin IV escaped the carnage, taking with him the True Cross, but St. Amand was captured and taken hostage. In August 1179, the new Templar fortress was captured and the knights stationed there were beheaded by the Muslim forces. St Amand died in one of Saladin's jails sometime during 1180, although no exact date survives. His release was proposed, in exchange for one Saladin's captive nephews, but negotiations came too late. Gathering support Not only were St. Amand's victories important from a military standpoint, but they were vital in gaining fresh pledges of money and resources from homeland countries in Europe. Inspired by the Templars' sensational victory at Montgisard, Renaud, Lord of Margat, donated half of the income from several of his cities to the order's cause.The Masters of the Templar Order : Pierre de Montaigu References Sources * Category:1110 births Category:1179 deaths Category:Grand Masters of the Knights Templar Category:12th-century French people ","title":"Odo de St Amand"},{"id":"1894108","text":"Dunnite, also known as Explosive D or systematically as ammonium picrate, is an explosive developed in 1906 by US Army Major Beverly W.

Bentheim-Steinfurt was a partition of Bentheim-Bentheim, itself a partition of the County of Bentheim. Bentheim-Steinfurt was partitioned: between itself and Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda in 1606; and between itself and Bentheim-Bentheim in 1643. History Bentheim Castle Steinfurt Castle Bentheim-Steinfurt and its territories were converted to Lutheranism in 1544 by Count Arnold II. He was succeeded by his less-religious son, Eberwin III. After the latter's early death at age 26, he was succeeded by his infant child, Arnold III, under the regency of Anna of Tecklenburg. Arnold III married Magdalena of Neuenahr in 1576, and he began attempts to properly convert the county to Protestantism. In the autumn of 1587, Lutheran preachers from across Germany were invited to help reform the Counties of Bentheim, Steinfurt, Lingen and Tecklenburg. The new laws were largely modelled on those of M√∂rs, and were introduced in Bentheim and Tecklenburg, in the following year, and finally Steinfurt in 1591. Arnold also founded a successful school in Sch√ºttorf during 1588, which was relocated to Steinfurt in 1591 and taught Latin, law, theology, philosophy and (from 1607) medicine. Arnold died in 1606, and was succeeded by his sons Arnold Jobst, William Henry, Frederick Liudolph and Conrad Gumbert. Arnold Jobst created the Higher Church Council 1613 in the Bentheim territory as the supreme spiritual authority below the counts, and also in that year the Reformed Church of Bentheim was created, comprising also the Twelve Articles. In 1643, Arnold Jobst died and was succeeded by his son Ernest William. He was greatly influenced by Bernhard von Galen, the Prince-Bishop of M√ºnster, and in 1688 he converted to Roman Catholicism. A fierce crisis ensued in which the Protestant preachers were expelled. Ernest William died in 1693, and it was left to his son and heir, Count Ernest, to resolve the troubles, doing so by converting to Lutheranism in 1701. A new reformed Church constitution was released, modelled on the 1678 Church Constitution of Lingen (it would continue in use until 1971). Bentheim-Steinfurt obtained the Castle Batenburg in 1700, although by that time it had ceased to be permanently garrisoned, and it was destroyed by the French in 1795. Count Louis obtained the County of Bentheim-Bentheim in 1803. Bentheim-Steinfurt was mediatised to Prussia in 1806, ceded to Berg in 1809, restored to Prussia in 1813 and ceded to the Kingdom of Hanover in 1815. Today, the still existing branches of the House of Bentheim are the Princes of Bentheim-Steinfurt with their seat at Steinfurt Castle (also still owners of the ancestral seat Burg Bentheim) and the Princes of Bentheim-Tecklenburg- Rheda with their seat at Rheda Castle (also still owners of Hohenlimburg Castle) and the Counts Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda.

St-Laurent sometimes operates in the Gulf of St. Lawrence to aid ships in transiting to Montreal, Quebec, although she usually only serves this assignment during particularly heavy ice years. History Louis S. St-Laurent alongside the pier at her (then) homeport, CCG Base Dartmouth, in June 2007. MV Fundy Paradise, Louis S. St- Laurent, and RV Farley Mowat at Sydport in Point Edward, Nova Scotia, March 2009. Louis S. St. Laurent was launched 3 December 1966 by Canadian Vickers Limited at Montreal, Quebec and commissioned in October 1969. From 8‚Äì22 September 1969 Louis S. St-Laurent sailed on the expedition in the Northwest Passage. She was assisted by and the United States Coast Guard vessels and . During 1976 Louis S. St-Laurent, Captain Paul M. Fournier in command, made a partial transit of the Northwest Passage traveling from east to west, through Lancaster Sound, Peel Sound, and Victoria Strait. In 1979 Louis S. St-Laurent, Captain George Burdock in command, made a full east to west transit of the Northwest Passage. She assisted CCGS Franklin, and circumnavigated North America. Louis S. St-Laurent underwent an extensive and costly modernization at Halifax Shipyard Ltd. in Halifax, Nova Scotia between 1988‚Äì1993 which saw her hull lengthened as well as new propulsion and navigation equipment installed. The modernization program was controversial as the government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney had initially proposed building a class of mega icebreakers (the Polar 8 Project) for promoting Canadian sovereignty in territorial waters claimed by Canada; had made an unauthorized transit of Canada's Northwest Passage in 1985 early in Mulroney's administration, provoking a strong nationalist out-cry across the country. However, budget cuts in the late 1980s saw proposed expansions of the coast guard and armed forces scrapped. In compensation to the coast guard, the government opted to modernize the largest icebreaker in its fleet, Louis S. St-Laurent. On 22 August 1994 Louis S. St-Laurent and USCGC Polar Sea became the first North American surface vessels to reach the North Pole. In the summer of 2006, CBC TV's The National broadcast from Louis S. St-Laurent in a special series focused on climate change. The vessel was originally scheduled to be decommissioned in 2000 however a refit extended the decommissioning date to 2017. In the 26 February 2008 federal budget, the Government of Canada announced it was funding a $721 million \\"Polar Class Icebreaker\\" (named ) as a replacement vessel for Louis S. St-Laurent. However, this mooted replacement vessel has been continually delayed compelling the life of Louis St. Laurent to be significantly extended. In 2014, with , Louis S. St-Laurent performed a cruise to the Arctic to map the undersea continental shelf. The two vessels were slowed by thick ice conditions. At 1:30 a.m. on 2 April 2015, Louis S. St-Laurent, arrived near Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador to take the damaged Canadian Coast Guard vessel under tow. Ann Harvey, which had run aground near Burgeo, was already being towed by the lifeboat CCGS W.G. George when the icebreaker arrived. Louis S. St-Laurent took over the tow and brought Ann Harvey into Connoire Bay where Royal Canadian Navy divers could inspect the ship. In 2016 Louis S. St-Laurent was deployed to the Arctic carrying an international team of scientists mapping the sea floor. The first leg of the mission was a voyage to Norway mapping the Atlantic. This was to be followed by a 47-day leg to the North Pole. Travelling with the Swedish icebreaker Oden, Louis S. St-Laurents mission to the Arctic was the last of three performed in order to define Canada's claim to the Arctic continental shelf. While mapping during transit to the north, the scientists aboard the ship discovered a chain of 25‚Äì30 undersea volcanoes off the coast of Greenland. On 22 March 2019, and Louis S. St-Laurent were dispatched to aid the tanker which had damaged a rudder in heavy ice and lost steering southwest of Port-aux- Basques, Newfoundland. Captain Molly Kool towed the vessel further out to sea to await the arrival of a tugboat, which would take the tanker to Sydney, Nova Scotia for repairs.

Christian country music is a form of Christian music and a subgenre of both Gospel music and Country music. Like other forms of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of Christian country music varies according to culture and social context. It is composed and performed for many purposes, ranging from aesthetic pleasure, religious or ceremonial purposes with a positive message, or as an entertainment product for the marketplace. However, a common theme as with most Christian music is praise, worship or thanks to God and/or Christ. Organizations Many Christian country organizations have been around for a great number of years. The oldest of all of these organizations is the International Country Gospel Music Association which was founded in 1957.ICGMA as Oldest Organization for Christian Country Music These organizations were founded to further artists careers much in the same manner as the GMA, NARAS or CMA. Many of these organizations have yearly conventions which hosts music showcases and awards shows. The CCMA was sued by the CMA for award name right infringement. The CCMA renamed their awards show after a federal judge ruled that they could no longer use the name.

That is a positive move for this genre, however, because there are few terrestrial radio stations that play a strictly Christian country format. Many mainstream country stations only have a weekly Sunday Country Gospel show.Bob Wilson KNGR Radio Christian country has several syndicated programs.

Artists Many secular country music artists have recorded country gospel songs or have performed them on their radio and television programs. From 1956-1960, two network shows usually concluded with a gospel number, which was popular with viewers: The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show and Red Foley's Ozark Jubilee. Other shows like Hee Haw, the Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters Show, and the Statler Brothers implemented the same programming style. For instance, Hee Haw featured a gospel song at the end of each of its shows; series stars Roy Clark, Buck Owens, Grandpa Jones and Kenny Price would sing either a traditional hymn or a newer one well known by mainstream country and Christian country audiences, and the segment itself served as a balance to the show's loony, corn-style humor. The Grand Ole Opry, the longest running radio show and one of the most popular country music shows, has always included gospel music as a part of its program. In the past, most Christian country music was recorded by groups with southern gospel flair like the Oak Ridge Boys, Mercy River Boys, The Cook Family Singers, Red Sovine, The Louvin Brothers and The Carter Family. Eventually, more mainstream country artists‚Äîranging from Loretta Lynn and Dolly Parton to Alabama and Alan Jackson‚Äîrecorded gospel albums while continuing to record secular music. Johnny Cash, a devout Christian despite living a troubled life, recorded several best-selling gospel albums and always included a Christian song in his concerts. Ray Stevens, a musician known primarily for his comedy and novelty recordings, also recorded an album of Christian music and mixed Christian themes in his serious (\\"Everything is Beautiful,\\" stressing unity) and novelty (for instance, \\"Mississippi Squirrel Revival,\\" which had a theme of repentance) mainstream releases. Although The Oak Ridge Boys began releasing secular country songs in the late 1970s, they always maintained their gospel roots by recording religious material and performing gospel songs in their concerts, as well as releasing songs stressing Christian values and family unity. The Mercy River Boys released their debut album, Breakout (Canaan Records) in 1979, firmly establishing the new Christian Country genre. Don Cusic (Billboard Magazine, Vol. 90, No 31), credits Canaan Records for creating a band to crossover into country music, improving ‚Äúwhat is essentially a good product (gospel) and made it become commercially viable.‚Äù The Mercy River Boys charted hits in Country, Southern Gospel and on traditional Gospel formats. Other gospel groups followed the Oak Ridge Boys and the Mercy River Boys into Christian Country music. At times, gospel and Christian-themed songs earned mass mainstream appeal. Among the most popular of these songs included \\"Why Me\\" by Kris Kristofferson (1973, a plea for God's guidance and forgiveness), \\"The Seeker\\" by Dolly Parton (1975, a spiritual), \\"One Day at a Time\\" by Cristy Lane (1980, co-written by Kristofferson), \\"Three Wooden Crosses\\" by Randy Travis (2003, where a prostitute gives birth to a man who eventually becomes a preacher), \\"Long Black Train\\" by Josh Turner (2003, about resisting temptation from Satan and following the Lord instead); \\"Jesus Take the Wheel\\" by Carrie Underwood (2005, where a woman turns to Christ) and \\"When I Get Where I'm Going\\" by Brad Paisley (2006, about the afterlife).

The master clock, controlled by a temperature-compensated mercury pendulum, is wired to slave clocks throughout the building. In addition to wall clocks, it also controls time stamps that are used to stamp documents with the time, and a turret clock that is installed in a clock tower. The \\"program clock\\" is a timer that can be programmed with punched paper tape to ring bells or turn machines on and off at preprogrammed times. \`A\` clock network or clock system is a set of synchronized clocks designed to always show exactly the same time by communicating with each other. Clock networks usually consist of a central master clock kept in sync with an official time source, and one or more slave clocks which receive and display the time from the master.  Synchronization sources  The master clock in a clock network can receive accurate time in a number of ways: through the United States GPS satellite constellation, a Network Time Protocol server, the CDMA cellular phone network, a modem connection to a time source, or by listening to radio transmissions from WWV or WWVH, or a special signal from an upstream broadcast network. Some master clocks don't determine the time automatically. Instead, they rely on an operator to manually set them. Clock networks in critical applications often include a backup source to receive the time, or provisions to allow the master clock to maintain the time even if it loses access to its primary time source. For example, many master clocks can use the reliable frequency of the alternating current line they are connected to.  Slave clocks  Slave clocks come in many shapes and sizes. They can connect to the master clock through either a cable or a short-range wireless signal. In the 19th century Paris used a series of pneumatic tubes to transmit the signal. Some slave clocks will run independently if they lose the master signal, often with a warning light lit. Others will freeze until the connection is restored.  Clock synchronization  Many master clocks include the capability to synchronize devices like computers to the master clock signal. Common features include the transmission of the time via RS-232, a Network Time Protocol, or a Pulse Per Second (PPS) contact. Others provide SMPTE time code outputs, which are often used in television settings to synchronize the video from multiple sources. Master Clocks often come equipped with programmable relay outputs to synchronize other devices such as lights, doors, etc.  Applications  One of the driving factors in developing clock networks was the broadcast industry. Television, in particular, operates on a very strict schedule, where each second of airtime is planned ahead of time and must be executed precisely. A central clock system allows a television station's master control and production personnel to work within that schedule. A clock network synchronized to the standard UTC time also allows different television facilities to coordinate their activities without complicated out-of-band signaling. It also provides accurate timing to equipment in stations that are becoming increasingly automated. While television broadcasters were some of the first users of clock networks, the equipment is becoming increasingly useful in other industries. For example, the National Emergency Number Association issued directive NENA-04-002, offering standards in timekeeping for 911 dispatch centers throughout the United States. Other common clock network users include airports and schools.  History  One of the first clock networks was installed by Charles Shepherd for the Great Exhibition, held in London in 1851. Shepherd's technology was then installed at the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and a replica of his Shepherd Gate Clock outside the gate is still working, the original being severely damaged in a WWII air raid. In the period before the universal availability of A.C. mains or atomic clocks, many clock networks were installed using a highly accurate pendulum clock as a master clock. This clock resembled a longcase clock, but had a very robust mechanism and a less ornate case. Electrical contacts attached to the mechanism generated minute, half minute and sometimes one second electrical pulses which were fed to the slave clocks on pairs of wires. The devices driven could be wall clocks, employee time clocks, tower clocks and occasionally clock chiming mechanisms. Some master clocks were set up to control the frequency of a generating authority's mains output; others, in the UK, were arranged to synchronise themselves with the Greenwich Time Signal pips.

He was one of the last pupils of Franz Liszt. The Jos√© Vianna da Motta Music Competition was founded in 1957 in his honor. Life Jos√© Vianna da Motta was born on S√£o Tom√© Island, a Portuguese territory at the time where his father, also a great amateur musician, had opened a pharmacy. Moving with his family to Continental Portugal, he settled in Colares, near Sintra, where he soon showed his unusual skills in music, and in playing and composing works for the piano. In Berlin he had lessons from Xaver Scharwenka and Philipp Scharwenka before studying with Franz Liszt at Weimar in 1885 and with Hans von B√ºlow two years later. In the following years he undertook many concert tours all round the world. Although he was renowned for his virtuosity he was also dedicated to the music of J. S. Bach and Beethoven - playing all of the latter's 32 piano sonatas in a series of concerts in Lisbon in 1927. He also included lesser known composers in his recitals, playing, for example, works by Charles-Valentin Alkan at the Wigmore Hall in London in 1903.MacRae (2001), 37-8 He also made a number of transcriptions of Alkan's pedalier pieces into two hand versions.Smith (2000),II 223, 228-9 Vianna da Motta was also close to his fellow virtuoso Ferruccio Busoni, and wrote the programme notes for Busoni's major series of piano concerto concerts in Berlin.Hamilton (2008), 66 Vianna da Motta was also a composer in his own right, including orchestral works (one of them a symphony) as well as piano pieces. On 25 October 1906, Motta recorded ten piano rolls for Welte-Mignon including three of his own compositions. He was Director of the Lisbon Conservatory from 1919 to 1938.

He was the conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra from 1935 to 1937. Biography  He was born in Belvidere, New Jersey on July 26, 1876. Schelling was a child prodigy. His first teacher was his father. He made his debut at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at age 4. At age 7, Schelling traveled to Europe to study. He was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire. While in Europe he worked with many great masters including Percy Goetschius, Hans Huber, Richard Barth, Moritz Moszkowski and Theodor Leschetizky. At the age of 20 in 1896, he began studying with Ignace Paderewski and was his only pupil for three years. He toured Europe and North and South America, gaining a reputation as a remarkable pianist. His first wife was Lucie Howe Draper, whom he married on May 3, 1905 in Manhattan, New York City. She died on February 4, 1938 at their summer home in Lausanne, Switzerland. He married his second wife, Helen Huntington \\"Peggy\\" Marshall, on August 11, 1939, when she was 21 and he was 63. She was the stepdaughter of the philanthropist Brooke Astor, and a niece of Vincent Astor. He died of a cerebral embolism at his home in Manhattan, New York City on December 8, 1939. His bride of four months was at his deathbed side. Composer  Schelling wrote numerous works for piano, orchestra and chamber groups which were often performed during his lifetime, but have since fallen from the repertoire. His most popular work was A Victory Ball, a symphonic poem for orchestra based on an anti-war poem by Alfred Noyes. Willem Mengelberg and the New York Philharmonic Orchestra made an early electrical recording of the music for the Victor Talking Machine Company. Honours  He was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music, in 1917 by the fraternity's Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. Schelling was the first conductor of the Young People's Concerts of the New York Philharmonic. The first concert was held March 27, 1924. The concerts were designed to encourage the love of music in children. They combined the orchestra's performance with a lecture about one aspect or another of the orchestra or the music itself with a picture or demonstration, so that children were exposed to a variety of stimuli. The concerts were highly appreciated by children, as well as their parents. Schelling held these concerts in New York, and also took them on the road. Such cities as Philadelphia, London, Rotterdam and Los Angeles hosted them.

He held a Research Fellowship in the Mathematical Sciences at the IBM Watson Research Center, where he organised the \\"ADJ\\" group.Goguen, J.A., \\"Memories of ADJ: Computer Science and Engineering\\", Bulletin of the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science 36: 96‚Äì102 (1989). He also visited the University of Edinburgh in Scotland on three Senior Visiting Fellowships. From 1979 to 1988, Goguen worked at SRI International in Menlo Park, California. From 1988 to 1996, he was a professor at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford) in England and a Fellow at St Anne's College, Oxford. In 1996 he became professor of Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. Research areas Goguen's research interests included category theory (a branch of mathematics), software engineering, fuzzy logic, algebraic semantics, user interface design, algebraic semiotics, and the social and ethical aspects of science and technology. Lotfi Zadeh viewed Goguen's 1968 approach to \\"The Logic of Inexact Concepts\\" as seminal in the field of fuzzy logic. Goguen's PhD dissertation \\"Categories of fuzzy sets\\"J. A. Goguen, \\"Categories of fuzzy sets: Applications of non-Cantorian set theory\\", PhD Thesis, University of California, Berkeley (1968). was the first work to apply category theory to fuzzy logic, and led to Goguen categories being named after him. Goguen's research in the 1970s was one of the earliest approaches to the characterisation of computational automata from a categorical perspective.Bart Jacobs, \\"A Bialgebraic Review of Regular Expressions, Deterministic Automata and Languages\\", in Algebra, Meaning, and Computation, Springer, pp. 375 (2006). . Goguen's research with Thatcher, Wagner and Wright (also in the 1970s) was one of the earliest works to formalise the algebraic basis for data abstraction.V. S. Alagar, \\"Specification of Software Systems\\", Springer, pp. 216 (1999). . In the early 1990s Goguen and Rod Burstall developed the theory of institutions, a category-theoretic description of logical systems in computer science.J. A. Goguen and R. M. Burstall, \\"Institutions: Abstract Model Theory for Specification and Programming\\", Journal of the ACM 39: 95‚Äì146 (1992). Institution theory impacted the development of universal logic and became one of its most studied aspects.RƒÉzvan Diaconesc, \\"From Universal Logic to Computer Science, and Back\\" in Theoretical Aspects of Computing (ICTAC '14), Lecture Notes in Computer Science 8687, Springer, pp. 1‚Äì16 (2014). The term \\"Carnapian Goguenism\\" is used to refer to the application of institutions to ontologies.Oliver Kutz, Till Mossakowski, and Dominik L√ºcke, \\"Carnap, Goguen, and the Hyperontologies\\" Logica Universalis 4 (2): 255‚Äì333 (2010). Goguen also studied the philosophy of computation and information, formal methods (especially hidden algebra and theorem proving), and relational and functional programming. He wrote a retrospective of his work and its context, Tossing Algebraic Flowers Down the Great Divide.Goguen, J. A., \\"Tossing Algebraic Flowers Down the Great Divide\\", University of California, San Diego. Personal views Goguen was a practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism. Specifically, since the early 1970s he was a student of Ch√∂gyam Trungpa and, after his death in 1986, of his son Sakyong Mipham. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a faculty member of the science program at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, Colorado.

Today, Clair-Soleil Park is situated where the mill was located. After the fire, Cabano had several years of economic uncertainty and the city was in an economic decline. In 1970, after many years of hardships, a new industry was constructed under the name of \\"Cascades\\" in 1976‚Äì77. In May 1972, the parish church was burnt down by a pyromaniac. A community center was constructed in its place in 1974. In 1973, the Sacred Heart College burnt as well at the hands of the same pyromaniac. A primary school was constructed in its place, G√©rard-Collin school. The secondary school was constructed at the end of the 1960s. It opened its doors in September 1970. TransForce Inc., Canada's largest trucking company started in Cabano and its name reflected that (Cabano until 1992 then Cabano-Kingsway) until 1999 when it was renamed TransForce Inc. The company's headquarters eventually moved to Montreal.

UML tool is used broadly here to include application programs which are not exclusively focused on UML, but which support some functions of the Unified Modeling Language, either as an add-on, as a component or as a part of their overall functionality. Kinds of Functionality UML tools support the following kinds of functionality: =Diagramming= Diagramming in this context means creating and editing UML diagrams; that is diagrams that follow the graphical notation of the Unified Modeling Language. The use of UML diagrams as a means to draw diagrams of ‚Äì mostly ‚Äì object-oriented software is generally agreed upon by software developers. When developers draw diagrams of object-oriented software, they usually follow the UML notation. On the other hand, it is often debated whether those diagrams are needed at all, during what stages of the software development process they should be used, and how (if at all) they should be kept up to date. The primacy of software code often leads to the diagrams being deprecated. =Round-trip engineering= Round- trip engineering refers to the ability of a UML tool to perform code generation from models, and model generation from code (a.k.a., reverse engineering), while keeping both the model and the code semantically consistent with each other. Code generation and reverse engineering are explained in more detail below. Code generation Code generation in this context means that the user creates UML diagrams, which have some connected model data, and the UML tool derives from the diagrams part or all of the source code for the software system. In some tools the user can provide a skeleton of the program source code, in the form of a source code template, where predefined tokens are then replaced with program source code parts during the code generation process. There is some debate among software developers about how useful code generation as such is . It certainly depends on the specific problem domain and how far code generation should be applied. There are well known areas where code generation is an established practice, not limited to the field of UML. The idea of completely leaving the \\"code level\\" and starting to do \\"programming\\" directly from the UML diagram level (i.e., design level) is quite debated among developers . That is the vision for Model-driven architecture (MDA). This idea is not in such widespread use compared to other software development tools like compilers or software configuration management systems. An often cited criticism is that the UML diagrams lack the detail that is needed to contain the same information as is covered with the program source: Jack W. Reeves states that the final embodiment of the design lies in the source code. (His often quoted statement that \\"the Code is the design\\" http://www.developerdotstar.com/mag/articles/reeves_design_main.html by Jack W. Reeves has been misinterpreted to mean that there is no need for intermediate- and high-level software-design artifacts, such as UML diagrams or software-requirements documents). Reverse engineering Reverse engineering in this context means, that the UML tool reads program source code as input and derives model data and corresponding graphical UML diagrams from it (as opposed to the somewhat broader meaning described in the article \\"Reverse engineering\\"). Some of the challenges of reverse engineering are: * The source code often has much more detailed information than one would want to see in design diagrams. This problem is addressed by software architecture reconstruction. * Diagram data is normally not contained with the program source, such that the UML tool, at least in the initial step, has to create some random layout of the graphical symbols of the UML notation or use some automatic layout algorithm to place the symbols in a way that the user can understand the diagram. For example, the symbols should be placed at such locations on the drawing pane that they don't overlap. Usually, the user of such a functionality of a UML tool has to manually edit those automatically generated diagrams to attain some meaningfulness. It also often doesn't make sense to draw diagrams of the whole program source, as that represents just too much detail to be of interest at the level of the UML diagrams. * There are language features of some programming languages, like class- or function templates of the C++ programming language, which are notoriously hard to convert automatically to UML diagrams in their full complexity. =Model and diagram interchange= XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) is the format for UML model interchange. XMI does not support UML Diagram Interchange, which allows the importation of UML diagrams from one model to another. =Model transformation= A key concept associated with the model-driven architecture initiative is the capacity to transform a model into another model. For example, one might want to transform a platform-independent domain model into a Java platform-specific model for implementation. It is also possible to refactor UML models to produce more concise and well-formed UML models. It is possible to generate UML models from other modeling notations, such as BPMN, which is itself a UML profile. The standard that supports this is called QVT for Queries/Views/Transformations. One example of an open-source QVT-solution is the ATL language built by INRIA.

Young Jr. (born January 10, 1977) is an American former POW in the 2003 Gulf military action against Iraq who later became a contestant in the reality show The Amazing Race 7. Young is also an Eagle Scout. Biography Young grew up in Lithia Springs, Georgia and lives in Villa Rica, Georgia. He graduated from Douglas County High School in Douglasville, Georgia, studied mechanical engineering at Southern Polytechnic State University in Marietta, Georgia, before joining the Army. At the time of his becoming a POW in Iraq his father was living in Lithia Springs, Georgia. Iraqi POW Young was among seven POWs who were taken prisoner by Iraqi forces in the 2003 invasion. Back then, he was a Chief Warrant Officer whose Apache Longbow helicopter crashed in Karbala on March 24, 2003. Fellow pilot and Chief Warrant Officer David Williams, 31 from the 1-227 Helicopter Attack Battalion tried to elude capture, but they were taken prisoner by an Iraqi group who took them to Samarra, about south of Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown. The Iraqi forces kept the two with the members of the 507th Maintenance Company who were earlier captured along with their comrade Jessica Lynch. The 507th POWs included Patrick Miller, Joseph Hudson, Shoshana Johnson, James Riley, and Edgar Hernandez. They were rescued soon after on April 13, 2003. The Amazing Race 7 Over a year later, he competed in The Amazing Race 7 together with his then girlfriend, beauty queen Kelly McCorkle. They were billed as the \\"Former POW/Beauty Queen couple\\" and his back story about his POW days were mentioned in the show. Young, like almost all contestants who competed there (except for well-known Survivor contestants Rob Mariano and Amber Brkich), was identified only by his first name. Ron & Kelly's relationship was strained during the competition and they broke up after the show but they still have remained friends. They eventually finished third when in San Juan, Puerto Rico they \\"went to the regional airport instead of the international airport,\\" Young said, going to the wrong airport caused them to miss their flight. Later life Young became part of an urban legend when a viral email claiming that the Red Lobster in the town Young's unit was based refused to donate money to the Young family. Even though the Army \\"highly discourages spouses soliciting businesses on behalf of families,\\" and that \\"no business should feel strong-armed into donating\\" Red Lobster had actually wanted to give money but had run out of gift certificates. Young works for the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, as a motivational speaker and a cable news special contributor.

Often, large dictionaries, such as the Oxford English Dictionary and Webster's, will contain some etymological information, without aspiring to focus on etymology. Etymological dictionaries are the product of research in historical linguistics. For many words in any language, the etymology will be uncertain, disputed, or simply unknown. In such cases, depending on the space available, an etymological dictionary will present various suggestions and perhaps make a judgement on their likelihood, and provide references to a full discussion in specialist literature. The tradition of compiling \\"derivations\\" of words is pre-modern, found for example in Indian (nirukta), Arabic (al-i≈°tiqƒÅq) and also in Western tradition (in works such as the Etymologicum Magnum). Etymological dictionaries in the modern sense, however, appear only in the late 18th century (with 17th-century predecessors such as Vossius' 1662 Etymologicum linguae Latinae or Stephen Skinner's 1671 Etymologicon Linguae Anglicanae), with the understanding of sound laws and language change and their production was an important task of the \\"golden age of philology\\" in the 19th century.

A Field Guide to the Reptiles and Amphibian of East Africa. Academic Press. pp. 227-228. Global Invasive Species Database. (2010). Chamaeleo jacksonii (reptile). Retrieved 16 November 2014.California Herps: A Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of California. . Retrieved 20 April 2017. Taxonomy Jackson's chameleon was described by Belgian-British zoologist George Albert Boulenger in 1896. (Chamaeleon jacksonii, new species). Etymology The generic name, Trioceros, is derived from the Greek œÑœÅŒØ- (tri-) meaning \\"three\\" and Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (k√©ras) meaning \\"horns\\". This is in reference to the three horns found on the heads of males. The specific name, jacksonii, is a Latinized form of English explorer and ornithologist Frederick John Jackson's last name, who was serving as the first Governor of Kenya at the time.Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Chamaeleo jacksonii, p. 132). The English word chameleon (also chamaeleon) derives from Latin chamaele≈ç, a borrowing of the Ancient Greek œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒπŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ (khamail√©≈çn), a compound of œáŒ±ŒºŒ±ŒØ (khama√≠) \\"on the ground\\" and ŒªŒ≠œâŒΩ (l√©≈çn) \\"lion\\". The Greek word is a calque translating the Akkadian nƒì≈° qaqqari, \\"ground lion\\".Dictionary.com entry for \\"chameleon\\" Subspecies The three subspecies, including the nominate, are: * T. j. jacksonii ‚Äì Jackson's chameleon * T. j. merumontanus ‚Äì dwarf Jackson's chameleon * T. j. xantholophus ‚Äì yellow-crested Jackson's chameleon Habitat and geographic range Wild T. j. xantholophus from Hilo, Hawaii Jackson's chameleons are native to woodlands and forests at altitudes of in south- central Kenya and northern Tanzania.Waring GH (1996) Preliminary Study of the Behavior and Ecology of Jackson's Chameleon of Maui, Hawaii.

In Tanzania, it is known only from Mount Meru in the Arusha Region, which is the home of the relatively small endemic subspecies T. j. merumontanus. Jackson's chameleon is more widespread in Kenya, where it is even found in wooded areas of some Nairobi suburbs. The subspecies T. j. xantholophus (native to the Mount Kenya region) was introduced to Hawaii in 1972 and has since established populations on all main islands and became invasive species there.Holland BS, Montgomery SL, Costello V (2010). \\"A reptilian smoking gun: first record of invasive Jackson‚Äôs chameleon (Chamaeleo jacksonii ) predation on native Hawaiian species\\".

Pacific Science 66: 397-404. PDF. This subspecies has also been introduced to Florida. In Hawaii, they are found mainly at altitudes of in wet, shady places. Historically this population was the primary source of Jackson's chameleons for the exotic pet trade in the United States, but exports from Hawaii are now illegal. This has been done to prevent opportunists from willfully establishing further feral animal populations to capture and sell them. Description A Jackson's chameleon at the Wellington Zoo Jackson's chameleons are sometimes called three-horned chameleons because males possess three brown horns: one on the nose (the rostral horn) and one above each superior orbital ridge above the eyes (preocular horns), somewhat reminiscent of the ceratopsid dinosaur genus Triceratops. The females generally have no horns, or instead have traces of the rostral horn (in the subspecies T. j. jacksonii and T. j. merumontanus). The coloring is usually bright green, with some individual animals having traces of blue and yellow, but like all chameleons, they change color quickly depending on mood, health, and temperature. These are small to medium-sized chameleons. Adult males reach a total length (including tail) of up to and females up to , but more typical lengths are . They have a saw-tooth shaped dorsal ridge and no gular crest. They attain sexual maturity after five months. The lifespan is variable, with males generally living longer than females. The largest subspecies of Jackson's chameleon is T. j. xantholophus, which has been captively bred since the 1980s. Ecology =Feeding habits= Jackson's chameleons live primarily on a diet of small insects. They also prey on centipedes, isopods, millipedes, spiders, lizards, small birds, and snails in their native habitat. =Invasive species= There is a threat of devastating impact of introduced invasive Jackson's chameleons to native ecosystems in Hawaii. They were found with mainly insects in their stomachs: planthoppers Oliarus, grasshoppers Banza, casebearing caterpillars Hyposmocoma, beetles Oodemas, dragonflies Pantala and others. Holland et al. (2010) proved that they also prey on snails in Hawaii. Their prey includes land snails Achatinella, Auriculella, Lamellidea, Philonesia, Oxychilus alliarius. They are swallowing whole snails (including shells). Jackson's chameleons introduced to Hawaii are a substantial threat to native biodiversity of invertebrates and a serious threat especially to endemic species, such as critically endangered O'ahu tree snails (genus Achatinella). =Territoriality= T. jacksonii are less territorial than most species of chameleons. Males will generally assert dominance over each other through color displays and posturing in an attempt to secure mating rights, but usually not to the point of physical fights. Reproduction Most chameleons are oviparous, but Jackson's chameleon gives birth to offspring soon before they are ready to hatch from their egg sac; eight to thirty live young are born after a five- to six-month gestation. The subspecies T. j. merumontanus gives birth to five to ten live young. In captivity In captivity, Jackson's chameleons require high humidity, and are in general very needy of colder temperatures during the night. Too much heat, or excessive humidity, can cause eye infections and upper respiratory infections in these animals. In captivity, the Jackson's chameleon can be expected to live between five and ten years.Exotic Pets section of About.com References External links Jackson's Chameleon Care Information at Caresheets.net * Chamaeleo jacksonii information from HEAR * Preliminary study of the behavior and ecology of Jackson's chameleons of Maui, Hawaii (Dr. George H.

Career Newman signed for Bristol City as an apprentice in October 1981, later serving as club captain and eventually playing 483 games for the club, leaving him seventh on Bristol City's all-time appearances chart.http://www.bcfc.co.uk/news/article/all-time-appearances-406533.aspx After three consecutive relegations Bristol City were in financial turmoil in 1982. Eight of the club's top-earning players - known as the 'Ashton Gate Eight' - saved the club by ripping up their contracts and taking redundancy.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8500609.stm On 6 February 1982 Bristol City played Fulham at Ashton Gate in the first match following the departure of the eight senior players. The team was populated with several young reserve team players, including an 18-year-old Newman. Having been with the club at this low point, Newman was a key figure in improving the club's fortunes. Playing predominantly in central midfield and defence, he helped the club win promotion to Division 3 in 1984,http://www.theleaguepaper.com/latest- news/football-league-division-one/1050/where-are-they-now-bristol- city-1983-84-division-four-promotion-winners/ win the Associate Members' Cup in 1986 and achieve a further promotion, to Division 2, in 1990. After a decade at Ashton Gate, Newman was sold to Norwich City for ¬£600,000 in the summer of 1991. He was a member of the Norwich team that finished a club record third in the FA Premier League in 1992‚Äì93 and went on to play a part in the defeat of Bayern Munich in the following season's UEFA Cup. He had also helped them reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup in his first season at Carrow Road. During his time with Norwich, Newman was initially used in 1991‚Äì92 as a central midfielder, where he managed to score several important goals. He even deputised as a forward covering for injuries. He was ultimately primarily played in central defence in the majority of games for Norwich, particularly later on in his career. Newman was noted for his determination, versatility and a very hard (if not always accurate) shot. During a dead ball competition at Wembley in 1994, it was found that Newman had the hardest shot in the league at the time.http://www.shrimper.org.uk/players/newman.php He stayed at Norwich until the end of the 1997-98, when new manager Bruce Rioch decided not to renew his contract. He then signed for Southend United, and later worked on the coaching staff at Roots Hall, as well as having a spell as assistant manager. Towards the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, Newman signed as cover for Chelmsford City. In July 2003, Newman signed for Gorleston. In October 2004, Newman was appointed caretaker manager of Gorleston. After his playing days, Newman became a manager in the lower leagues of English football. He had a short time spell at Southend United before being appointed assistant manager to Steve Thompson at Cambridge United in December 2004. Following Thompson's departure from an unsuccessful spell which led to Cambridge's relegation from the Football League, Newman was appointed manager in May 2005. Newman built a squad with very little money and showed his abilities in scouting little-known players. He also gained the support of the majority of Cambridge fans, earning him the nickname of 'Buzz Lightyear', owing to his facial likeness to the character from the motion-picture Toy Story. Some fans even set up a fan site (see below), and wore Buzz Lightyear masks in homage to him. However, he was sacked following United's 3‚Äì1 defeat by Exeter City on 1 September 2006 that left the club second-bottom of the Conference. The following month, the new Bournemouth manager Kevin Bond appointed Newman as his assistant. Newman also played for the Bournemouth reserves team. Most of the time, it was when Reserve Team Manager Eddie Howe played a youthful side to help stabilise the defence. Occasionally, he was included in Bournemouth first team, being named a sub in the match against Carlisle after the team had only 14 fit first team players. He made his Bournemouth d√©but away to Bristol Rovers in a Football League Trophy South Section Area Second Round match, appearing as a substitute. Bournemouth went on to win the match 1‚Äì0. Newman was sacked along with Kevin Bond and Eddie Howe in September 2008. Newman is currently head of Manchester City's Spanish scouting team.

It runs from Kinross to M-129 near Donaldson. The highway serves the site of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base and the current Chippewa County International Airport. The designation has been used twice before on roads in the Lower Peninsula in the 1910s through 1930s while the current usage dates back to the mid-1990s. Route description M-80 starts at exit 378 along Interstate 75 (I-75) near Kinross. A short section of it runs concurrently with H-63 (Mackinac Trail) to connect to ramps in the interchange. This section runs northeast‚Äìsouthwest across the freeway from Mud Lake before the M-80 designation turns southeasterly along Tone Road running past Kinross Lake in a forested area. Tone Road curves sharply northeasterly and then southeasterly to run around the north end of the runway complex at the Chippewa County International Airport. The highway runs due east past the airport terminal area to the south and a prison and the residential area of the former Kincheloe Air Force Base to the north. Near Dukes Lake, M-80 crosses Gaines Highway and leaves the former base and runs through forest to the intersection with M-129 where M-80 terminates. The roadway continues eastward as 17 Mile Road in Pickford Township. M-80 has not been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). The NHS is a network of highways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. MDOT's annual surveys of the traffic counts are used to compute a value called the annual average daily traffic (AADT), which is a measurement of the number of vehicles on a road for any given day of the year. The survey from 2009 showed that 2,803 vehicles used the western section between I-75 and Gaines Highway, with 61 trucks included in the count. The eastern section was used by 1,657 vehicles and 61 trucks. History On July 1, 1919, M-80 existed as a highway in the Lower Peninsula connecting Adrian with Somerset. The highway was included in the route of US Highway 127 in 1926. The M-80 designation was then shifted to a section of highway that was previously part of M-18 near Beaverton The M-80 designation was decommissioned in 1939 when the roadway was transferred back to local control. The current designation of M-80 was created in 1994‚Äì95 when Tone Road through Kinross and the former Kincheloe Air Force Base were transferred to MDOT. The department assigned the roadway its designation and included it on the 1995 map.

Captain Jacob Gronow, Harbour Master of Port Jackson (Sydney), proposed the flag in 1831 in The NSW Calendar and Post Office Gazette; Gronow also designed the flag, which was based on the Colonial Flag of 1823. Like the Colonial Flag, the Federation Flag features a combination of the Union Flag and the Southern Cross, but the cross is blue, not red, and there are five stars, not four. The flag's appearance varied greatly depending on where it was made: different manufacturers produced Federation Flags with darker or lighter shades of blue for the cross background; using five-pointed stars instead of eight; or positioning the stars in different places. The Eureka Flag, flown by rebels at the Eureka Stockade in 1854, was reportedly influenced by designs such as the Federation flag. While the Federation Flag proved popular and was widely used on the East Coast of Australia for over 70 years, it was never officially adopted. It was especially popular among proponents of Australian Federation and was also used as an unofficial ensign by the merchant marine. In 1884 Lord Derby of the Colonial Office banned the use of the Flag at sea, possibly because of its similarity to the White Ensign. A ribbon produced in Sydney In the 1880s and early 1890s it was used as a symbol of the political movement towards Federation, with groups like the Australian Natives' Association and the Australian Federation League using it to promote national consciousness of their push for Federation, under the slogan \\"One People, One Destiny, One Flag\\". The flag was a favourite of Australia's first Prime Minister, Sir Edmund Barton, who asked that a variant be considered for approval along with the competition-winning Blue Ensign. The Colonial Office rejected the Federation Flag, issuing Barton a mild rebuke. The Australian government received approval to fly the Blue Ensign in 1903, but the Australian Federation Flag was still being flown by Australian citizens as late as the 1920s. It is still used in Sydney Central Railway Station main hall. The Australian nationalist Fraser Anning's Conservative National Party uses the Australian Federation Flag as a shield in its logo.

In 1968 Almagro won another title and promoted to Primera. Almagro was founded on January 6, 1911, in the Almagro neighbourhood of Buenos Aires. The club still has its sports facilities there for its members, but the football stadium (with a capacity of 19,000) is located in Jos√© Ingenieros, in the Tres de Febrero Partido of Greater Buenos Aires. In 1919 there was a new splitting in Argentine football, so both leagues were played at the same time: official Asociaci√≥n Argentina de Football (with one of Almagro predecessors, Columbian, as one of its teams) and dissident \\"Asociaci√≥n Amateurs de Football\\". During that season, Columbian was going through a severe economic crisis, disputing its last game v. Boca Juniors in the 6th fixture. Some executives of recently promoted Club Almagro, leadered by Miguel de Z√°rate made Columbial a merger proposal, which was accepted. Therefore, Almagro renamed \\"Sportivo Almagro\\" and continued playing in Primera Divisi√≥n (debuting in the 7th fixture vs Platense) under its new denomination, which avoided the club to be disaffiliated.Argentina 1919 at RSSSF.comHistoria del club Almagro\\"Una historia en tres colores\\", Clar√≠n, 24 Jul 2000\\"Or√≠genes del Club Almagro\\", Almagro Mi Pasi√≥n (Archivo, 23 Abr 2009)\\"Tigre Campe√≥n Intermedia 1912 ‚Äì F.A.F.\\" (Archivo, 2011)1919 en El Sitio de Almagro F√∫tbol extinto: Columbian Almagro played one year in first division in 1938 after winning the first second division tournament that awarded a promotion.

Waddell's signs may indicate non-organic or psychological component to chronic low back pain. Historically they have also been used to detect malingering in patients with back pain. While testing takes less than one minute, it has been described as time-consuming and alternatives have been proposed. Use of Waddell's signs Waddell, et al. (1980) described five categories of signs: * Tenderness tests: superficial and diffuse tenderness and/or nonanatomic tenderness * Simulation tests: these are based on movements which produce pain, without actually causing that movement, such as axial loading and pain on simulated rotation * Distraction tests: positive tests are rechecked when the patient's attention is distracted, such as a straight leg raise test * Regional disturbances: regional weakness or sensory changes which deviate from accepted neuroanatomy * Overreaction: subjective signs regarding the patient's demeanor and reaction to testing Any individual sign marks its category as positive. When three or more categories were positive, the finding was considered clinically significant. However, assessing the patient on the basis of overreaction has raised concerns regarding observer bias and idiosyncrasies related to the patient's culture. Consequently, a practitioner may assess the patient on the remaining four categories, with two or more positive categories being considered clinically significant. One or two Waddell's signs can often be found even when there is not a strong non-organic component to pain. Three or more are positively correlated with high scores for depression, hysteria and hypochondriasis on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory.  Criticism  Although Waddell's signs can detect a non-organic component to pain, they do not exclude an organic cause. Clinically significant Waddell scores are considered indicative only of symptom magnification or pain behavior, and have been misused in medical and medico-legal contexts. Waddell's signs are not considered a de facto indicator of deception for the purpose of financial gain. In a 2003 review, Fishbain, et al. stated that Waddell's signs do not reliably distinguish organic from psychological pain but instead tend to underestimate the amount of pain that is actually experienced. In a 2004 review, Fishbain, et al. concluded, \\"there was little evidence for the claims of an association between Waddell signs and secondary gain and malingering. The preponderance of the evidence points to the opposite: no association\\". In 2010, a neuroanatomical basis of Waddell's signs has been proposed which argues that since the brain is organic, and even society is composed of a group of organic beings, the term \\"nonorganic\\" should be replaced by a term put forward by Chris Spanswick in 1997, \\"behavioral responses to physical examination.\\" With the possible exception of cogwheel rigidity, these are best understood as neuroanatomical maladaptations to long- continued pain and, as Waddell and colleagues have stressed, do not indicate faking or malingering but rather that there are psychosocial issues that mitigate against successfully treating low back pain by lumbar discectomy, and which in themselves require other treatment.Ranney, DA.

Turn of the century, in its broadest sense, refers to the transition from one century to another. The term is most often used to indicate a distinctive time period either before or after the beginning of a century or both before and after. Where no specific century is stated, the term usually refers to the most recent transition of centuries. In British English the phrase 'the turn of the nineteenth century' refers to the years immediately preceding and immediately following 1801, 'the turn of the twentieth century' to the years surrounding 1901, and so on. In American English it isn't so clear cut. According to the Chicago Manual of Style online Q&A;, there is no common agreement as to the meaning of the phrase \\"turn of the n-th century.\\" For instance, if a statement describes an event as taking place \\"at the turn of the 18th century,\\" it could refer to a period around the year 1701 or around 1800, that is, the beginning or end of that century. As a result, they recommend either using only \\"turn of the century,\\" and only in a context that makes clear which transition is meant, or alternatively to use a different expression that is unambiguous. \\"Turn of the century\\" commonly meant the transition from the 19th century to the 20th century; however, as the generations living at the end of the 20th century survived into the 21st century, the specific number of the referenced century became necessary to avoid confusion.

It most often includes the extinct groups Temnospondyli and Lepospondyli. The first tetrapods were all amphibians in the physiological sense that they laid their eggs in water, and are colloquially sometimes referred to as labyrinthodonts or stegocephalians. In this scheme, batrachomorphs composed one branch of these early amphibians, while the reptiliomorphs composed the other. While the actual phylogeny of the modern amphibians is not well understood, their ancestors are descended from one line of batrachomorphs.Laurin, M. (1996): Phylogeny of Stegocephalians, from the Tree of Life Web Project All other living tetrapods (reptiles, birds and mammals) are descended from one branch of reptiliomorphs, the amniotes. Amniotes achieved dominance, while all other reptiliomorphs and most batrachomorphs have gone extinct. Classification =Origin of the term= The name Batrachomorpha was coined by the Swedish palaeontologist Gunnar S√§ve- S√∂derbergh in 1934 to refer to ichthyostegids, temnospondyls, anthracosaurs, and the frogs. S√§ve-S√∂derbergh held the view that salamanders and caecilians are not related to the other tetrapods, but had developed independently from a different group of lobe-finned fish, the porolepiformes.S√§ve-S√∂derbergh, G. (1934). Some points of view concerning the evolution of the vertebrates and the classification of this group. Arkiv f√∂r Zoologi 26A: pp 1-20 In this view amphibians would be a biphyletic group, and Batrachomorpha was erected to form a natural group consisting of the \\"true amphibians\\" (i.e. frogs in S√§ve- S√∂derberghs view) and their fossil relatives. The salamanders and the Lepospondyli was consigned to \\"Urodelomorpha\\". Friedrich von Huene adopted it as a superorder of his subclass \\"Eutetrapoda\\" (the lower tetrapods exclusive of the urodeles) and included the orders Stegocephalia (here including a number of Labyrinthodonts and anurans).von Huene, F. (1956): Pal√§ontologie und Phylogenie der niederen Tetrapoden, G. Fischer, Jena Erik Jarvik, who took over S√§ve-S√∂derberghs work and shared his view of the origin of salamanders, used the term more informally, but in a wider sense, to include the ancestral osteolepiform fishes.Jarvik, E. (1980). Basic structure and evolution of vertebrates. Vol. 2. London: Academic Press. Though never a majority view, the notion that tetrapods had evolved twice, together with the usage of the term batrachomorpha, lingered until genetic analysis started confirming the monophyly of living amphibians in the 1990s.San Mauro & al (2005): Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea. American Naturalist no 165: pp 590‚Äì599 Jarviks classification is no longer followed, all living amphibians and their fossil relatives now being classified together in the group Lissamphibia. =Phylogenetics= The short, broad skull of Eryops is typical of the batrachomorphans Michael Benton adopted the term Batrachomorpha to include all living amphibians and extinct relatives more closely related to amphibians than to reptiles. In his scheme, Batrachomorpha is a subclass of Amphibia, containing the following orders: * Subclass Batrachomorpha ** Order Temnospondyli ‚Ä† ** Order A√Østopoda ‚Ä† ** Order Nectridea ‚Ä† ** Order Microsauria ‚Ä† ** Order Gymnophiona (extant) ** Order Urodela (extant) ** Order Anura (extant) The other groups of tetrapods considered more closely related to amniotes are put in the subclass Reptiliomorpha. The phylogenetic relationships of Paleozoic tetrapods have not yet been worked out with certainty, and the validity of Batrachomorpha as a clade depends on where other amphibians and early amniotes fit on the evolutionary tree. The actual content of Batrachomorpha as cladistically defined is therefore uncertain, and in some phylogenies the clade is redundant (e.g. Laurin 1996).Anderson & al. (2008): A stem batrachian from the Early Permian of Texas and the origin of frogs and salamanders. Nature 453: 515-518. Laurin, M. (1996): Terrestrial Vertebrates - Stegocephalians: Tetrapods and other digit-bearing vertebrates Anatomy Batrachomorphs are distinguished by a number of features in the skeleton, including a flat or shallow skull, a fused skull roof with no cranial kinesis, exoccipital-postparietal contact on the occiput, and four or fewer fingers on the hand.Benton, M. J. (2000), Vertebrate Paleontology, 2nd Ed. Blackwell Science Ltd 3rd ed, pp.98-99 Benton contrasts Batrachomorphs with Reptiliomorphs; both are stem-based clades; the former constitutes the \\"amphibian\\" evolutionary radiation, the latter the contemporary proto-reptilian and early amniote evolution. In the appendix to Vertebrate Palaeontology, which combines cladistic and linnaean rankings, Benton has given Batrachomorpha the rank of Subclass in his 2001 edition and Class in the 2004 edition.

During the 19th century, Irish immigrants were quarantined at nearby Grosse Isle, now a National Historic site. Geology A strip of rather interesting underlying sedimentary bedrock maintains a relatively straight shoreline through which a natural harbour, quite round in shape, has been eroded. The bedrock is set at about a 60 to 80¬∞ angle and is composed of hundreds of very thin layers of red shale interspersed every meter or so with 5 to 10 cm layers of what appears to be limestone. It is quite dramatic in places where it hasn't been worn down by human activities.

It was developed when there were concerns as to performance of the Churchill tank.  Development  After the Dieppe Raid in August 1942, there was concern that the Churchill infantry tank was slow and too unreliable and it was suggested that production of the Churchill stop in 1943 in order to manufacture more of the A27 (Cromwell) design which was performing well in trials.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) p80 While two lines of tanks were still policy, there was interest in a \\"universal tank chassis\\" from which infantry tanks, cruiser tanks, and other vehicles could be built. Until then an interim design based on the A27 to replace the Churchill as an infantry tank was considered. Rolls- Royce proposed an up-armoured A27M (Cromwell): A31 was a Cromwell with more armour and A32 was a more thorough redesign of the A27 with stronger suspension and armour equivalent to the Churchill. English Electric, contracted to build Cromwells, proposed using the A27 hull and turret with extra armourThe armour on the Cromwell was bolted to the outside of the turret and the track and suspension of the 50-ton US M6 Heavy Tank which had been developed for both US and British use. This scheme received the General Staff number A33. English Electric built two prototypes on a Cromwell tank hull the first with the suspension and T1 track of the M6 tank in 1943 though with a 6-pounder gun. The second was built with a widened Cromwell track and suspension by LMS and different armoured skirts. The design included extra armour and an Ordnance QF 75 mm gun. When the problems of the early Churchill models were worked out, the A33 was no longer required and the project was dropped.

At the 2010 census, its population in the built-up (or metro) area was 779,412, up from 722,523 in the 2000 census. Shangyu is roughly fifty kilometers from north to south and about thirty kilometers from east to west. It makes up about one-fourth of the area of Shaoxing prefecture. Shangyu District is not part of the Hangzhou-Shaoxing built-up area as some countryside still prevent the city from being conurbated until now.

This river, and the Cao E Temple () next to it, are named after a fourteen-year-old girl who became famous in 143 AD for her filial devotion. She died in the river trying to retrieve the body of her father (Cao Xu) who drowned while officiating at a ceremony in honor of Wu Zixu who himself was famous for his filial piety. Baiguan is about east of Shaoxing's urban center. The railroad from Hangzhou to Ningbo passes through Baiguan, and the new superhighway between Hangzhou and Ningbo skirts Baiguan. Within Shangyu, just northwest of Baiguan, the Hangzhou-Ningbo highway (mostly east-west) intersects with a superhighway that goes south to the seacoast and then down the coast, through Wenzhou and Fuzhou, all the way to Guangzhou. In the name \\"Baiguan\\" () ‚Äúbai‚Äù means ‚Äúhundred‚Äù and ‚Äúguan‚Äù means an imperial civil service official. The city came to be called this when it became famous for producing many scholars who became officials by passing the imperial civil service examination.Shangyu Museum Girl in Shangyu Culture In the tragic legend of the Butterfly Lovers, the young lady was from Shangyu and the young gentleman was from Shaoxing. Two books by Zhang Jinhuan () published by the Zhejiang University Press deal with porcelain (mostly celadon) produced in the Cao'e River Valley in Shangyu starting in the Eastern Han dynasty: Shangyu Yue Kilns () (2007) , and Yue Porcelain Gems () (2009) . Language 280x280px Wu language, also known as Jiang Nan, Wu Yue, Jiang Dong language. Three thousand years of history from the Zhou Dynasty. In China, Wu language are distributing in Zhejiang, southern part of Jiangsu, Shanghai, southern part of Anhui and Fujian province. The population who use this language is about ninety million. People in Shangyu are use Wu language as major communication way in daily life. This language retains many ancient tones and words, culture value of research Chinese development is very high. It is a vivid expression of the thinking way and life style of the people who live in the south of the Yangtze River. More than one hundred cities led by Shanghai, make up Wu city group and Jiangnan culture circle that have similar value recognition, creating huge treasure through unity and mutual aid. Yangtze river delta region became the richest area in the whole China, Shangyu district is one of important part in it. Putonghua (Standard mandarin) is the general language of China, it takes Beijing pronunciation as the standard pronunciation, northern dialect as the basic dialect. Shangyu is located in the south of China, so these two languages are very different, but to enhance communication among all ethnic groups and promote the cohesion of the Chinese nation, the government started popularizing Putonghua on a national scale from 2005. Therefore, people in Shangyu using Wu language as daily communication and using Putonghua in schools or travel to other places.

In addition, Gong mountain with important scientific and ecological value of study the change and development of geologic structures. The Famen Temple () Faning Temple, renowned for storing the veritable finger bone of the Shakyamuni Buddha, is located in Shangyu of Zhejiang province. Faning Temple was established in the Eastern Han Dynasty (25‚Äì220) for spreading Buddhism. The most representative structures in the temple are the Faning Temple Pagoda and Faning Temple Museum. Many royal treasures and jewelry were found here because Buddhism was supported by dominators in ancient China. Faning Temple was the royal temple during the Sui and Tang Dynasty. Emperors in Sui and Tang believed that enshrining and worshiping the bone of Shakyamuni would bring richness and peace to the land and people. So, the finger bone was stored carefully, which was housed in the underground palace.

A common purpose of modern brain implants and the focus of much current research is establishing a biomedical prosthesis circumventing areas in the brain that have become dysfunctional after a stroke or other head injuries. This includes sensory substitution, e.g., in vision. Other brain implants are used in animal experiments simply to record brain activity for scientific reasons. Some brain implants involve creating interfaces between neural systems and computer chips. This work is part of a wider research field called brain-computer interfaces. (Brain-computer interface research also includes technology such as EEG arrays that allow interface between mind and machine but do not require direct implantation of a device.) Neural implants such as deep brain stimulation and Vagus nerve stimulation are increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease and clinical depression, respectively. Purpose Brain implants electrically stimulate, block or record (or both record and stimulate simultaneously) signals from single neurons or groups of neurons (biological neural networks) in the brain. The blocking technique is called intra-abdominal vagal blocking. This can only be done where the functional associations of these neurons are approximately known. Because of the complexity of neural processing and the lack of access to action potential related signals using neuroimaging techniques, the application of brain implants has been seriously limited until recent advances in neurophysiology and computer processing power. Much research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants in effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant. Researchers are also exploring a range of delivery systems, such as using veins, to deliver these implants without brain surgery; by leaving the skull sealed shut, patients could receive their neural implants without running as great a risk of seizures, strokes, or permanent neural impairments, all of which can be caused by open- brain surgery. Research and applications Research in sensory substitution has made significant progress since 1970. Especially in vision, due to the knowledge of the working of the visual system, eye implants (often involving some brain implants or monitoring) have been applied with demonstrated success. For hearing, cochlear implants are used to stimulate the auditory nerve directly. The vestibulocochlear nerve is part of the peripheral nervous system, but the interface is similar to that of true brain implants. Multiple projects have demonstrated success at recording from the brains of animals for long periods of time. As early as 1976, researchers at the NIH led by Edward Schmidt made action potential recordings of signals from rhesus monkey motor cortexes using immovable \\"hatpin\\" electrodes, including recording from single neurons for over 30 days, and consistent recordings for greater than three years from the best electrodes. The \\"hatpin\\" electrodes were made of pure iridium and insulated with Parylene, materials that are currently used in the Cyberkinetics implementation of the Utah array. These same electrodes, or derivations thereof using the same biocompatible electrode materials, are currently used in visual prosthetics laboratories, laboratories studying the neural basis of learning, and motor prosthetics approaches other than the Cyberkinetics probes. Schematic of the \\"Utah\\" Electrode Array Other laboratory groups produce their own implants to provide unique capabilities not available from the commercial products. Breakthroughs include: studies of the process of functional brain re-wiring throughout the learning of a sensory discrimination, control of physical devices by rat brains, monkeys over robotic arms, remote control of mechanical devices by monkeys and humans, remote control over the movements of roaches, the first reported use of the Utah Array in a human for bidirectional signalling. Currently a number of groups are conducting preliminary motor prosthetic implants in humans. These studies are presently limited to several months by the longevity of the implants. The array now forms the sensor component of the Braingate. Much research is also being done on the surface chemistry of neural implants in effort to design products which minimize all negative effects that an active implant can have on the brain, and that the body can have on the function of the implant. Another type of neural implant that is being experimented on is Prosthetic Neuronal Memory Silicon Chips, which imitate the signal processing done by functioning neurons that allows peoples' brains to create long-term memories. In 2016, scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign announced development of tiny brain sensors for use postoperative monitoring, which melt away when they are no longer needed. In 2016, scientists out of the University of Melbourne published proof-of-concept data related to a discovery for Stentrode, a device implanted via the jugular vein, demonstrated the potential for a neural recording device to be engineered onto a stent and implanted into a blood vessel in the brain, without the need for open brain surgery. The technology platform is being developed for patients with paralysis to facilitate control of external devices such as robotic limbs, computers and exoskeletons by translating brain activity. It may ultimately help diagnose and treat a range of brain pathologies, such as epilepsy and Parkinson‚Äôs disease. =Military= DARPA has announced its interest in developing \\"cyborg insects\\" to transmit data from sensors implanted into the insect during the pupal stage.

The initial success of the techniques has resulted in increased research and the creation of a program called Hybrid-Insect-MEMS, HI-MEMS. Its goal, according to DARPA's Microsystems Technology Office, is to develop \\"tightly coupled machine-insect interfaces by placing micro-mechanical systems inside the insects during the early stages of metamorphosis\\". The use of neural implants has recently been attempted, with success, on cockroaches. Surgically applied electrodes were put on the insect, which were remotely controlled by a human. The results, although sometimes different, basically showed that the cockroach could be controlled by the impulses it received through the electrodes. DARPA is now funding this research because of its obvious beneficial applications to the military and other areas In 2009 at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Micro-electronic mechanical systems (MEMS) conference in Italy, researchers demonstrated the first \\"wireless\\" flying-beetle cyborg.Ornes, Stephen. \\"THE PENTAGON'S BEETLE BORGS.\\" Discover 30.5 (2009): 14.

IEEE Spectrum, 17 Feb 2009. Web. 1 Mar 2010.. For the HI-MEMS cybernetic bug to be considered a success, it must fly from a starting point, guided via computer into a controlled landing within of a specific end point. Once landed, the cybernetic bug must remain in place. In 2012, DARPA provided seed funding to Dr. Thomas Oxley, a neurointerventionist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, for a technology that became known as Stentrode. Oxley‚Äôs group in Australia was the only non-US-based funded by DARPA as part of the Reliable Neural Interface Technology (RE-NET) program. This technology is the first to attempt to provide neural implants through a minimally invasive surgical procedure that does not require cutting into the skull. That is, an electrode array built onto a self-expanding stent, implanted into the brain via cerebral angiography. This pathway can provide safe, easy access and capture a strong signal for a number of indications beyond addressing paralysis, and is currently in clinical trials in patients with severe paralysis seeking to regain the ability to communicate. In 2015 it was reported that scientists from the Perception and Recognition Neuro-technologies Laboratory at the Southern Federal University in Rostov-on-Don suggested using rats with microchips planted in their brains to detect explosive devices. In 2016 it was reported that American engineers are developing a system that would transform locusts into \\"remote controlled explosive detectors\\" with electrodes in their brains beaming information about dangerous substances back to their operators. Rehabilitation Neurostimulators have been in use since 1997 to ease the symptoms of such diseases as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, dystonia and recently depression. Current brain implants are made from a variety of materials such as tungsten, silicon, platinum-iridium, or even stainless steel. Future brain implants may make use of more exotic materials such as nanoscale carbon fibers (nanotubes), and polycarbonate urethane. Brain implants are also being explored by DARPA as part of the Reliable Neural- Interface Technology (RE-NET) program launched in 2010 to directly address the need for high-performance neural interfaces to control the dexterous functions made possible by DARPA‚Äôs advanced prosthetic limbs. The goal is to provide high-bandwidth, intuitive control interface for these limbs, in order to achieve their full potential to improve quality of life for wounded troops. Historical research In 1870, Eduard Hitzig and Gustav Fritsch demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the brains of dogs could produce movements. Robert Bartholow showed the same to be true for humans in 1874. By the start of the 20th century, Fedor Krause began to systematically map human brain areas, using patients that had undergone brain surgery. Prominent research was conducted in the 1950s. Robert G. Heath experimented with aggressive mental patients, aiming to influence his subjects' moods through electrical stimulation. Yale University physiologist Jose Delgado demonstrated limited control of animal and human subjects' behaviours using electronic stimulation. He invented the stimoceiver or transdermal stimulator, a device implanted in the brain to transmit electrical impulses that modify basic behaviours such as aggression or sensations of pleasure. Delgado was later to write a popular book on mind control, called Physical Control of the Mind, where he stated: \\"the feasibility of remote control of activities in several species of animals has been demonstrated [...] The ultimate objective of this research is to provide an understanding of the mechanisms involved in the directional control of animals and to provide practical systems suitable for human application.\\" In the 1950s, the CIA also funded research into mind control techniques, through programs such as MKULTRA. Perhaps because he received funding for some research through the US Office of Naval Research, it has been suggested (but not proven) that Delgado also received backing through the CIA. He denied this claim in a 2005 article in Scientific American describing it only as a speculation by conspiracy-theorists. He stated that his research was only progressively scientifically motivated to understand how the brain works. Recent advances in neurotechnologies and neuroimaging, along with an increased understanding of neurocircuitry, are factors contributing to the rapid rise in the use of neurostimulation therapies to treat an increasingly wide range of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Electrical stimulation technologies are evolving after remaining fairly stagnant for the past 30 years, moving toward potential closed-loop therapeutic control systems with the ability to deliver stimulation with higher spatial resolution to provide continuous customized neuromodulation for optimal clinical outcomes. Concerns and ethical considerations Ethical questions raised include who are good candidates to receive neural implants and what are good and bad uses of neural implants. Whilst deep brain stimulation is increasingly becoming routine for patients with Parkinson's disease, there may be some behavioural side effects. Reports in the literature describe the possibility of apathy, hallucinations, compulsive gambling, hypersexuality, cognitive dysfunction, and depression. However, these may be temporary and related to correct placement and calibration of the stimulator and so are potentially reversible. Some transhumanists, such as Raymond Kurzweil and Kevin Warwick, see brain implants as part of a next step for humans in progress and evolution, whereas others, especially bioconservatives, view them as unnatural, with humankind losing essential human qualities. It raises controversy similar to other forms of human enhancement. For instance, it is argued that implants would technically change people into cybernetic organisms (cyborgs). It's also expected that all research will comply to the Declaration of Helsinki. Yet further, the usual legal duties apply such as information to the person wearing implants and that the implants are voluntary, with (very) few exceptions. Other concerns involve vulnerabilities of neural implants to cybercrime or intrusive surveillance as neural implants could be hacked, misused or misdesigned. Sadja states that \\"one's private thoughts are important to protect\\" and doesn't consider it a good idea to just charge the government or any company with protecting them. Walter Glannon, a neuroethicist of the University of Calgary notes that \\"there is a risk of the microchips being hacked by third parties\\" and that \\"this could interfere with the user's intention to perform actions, violate privacy by extracting information from the chip\\". In fiction and philosophy Brain implants are now part of modern culture but there were early philosophical references of relevance as far back as Ren√© Descartes. In his 1641 Meditations, Descartes argued that it would be impossible to tell if all one's apparently real experiences were in fact being produced by an evil demon intent on deception. A modern twist on Descartes' argument is provided by the \\"brain in a vat\\" thought experiment, which imagines a brain, sustained apart from its body in a vat of nutrients, and hooked up to a computer which is capable of stimulating it in such a way as to produce the illusion that everything is normal. Popular science fiction discussing brain implants and mind control became widespread in the 20th century, often with a dystopian outlook. Literature in the 1970s delved into the topic, including The Terminal Man by Michael Crichton, where a man suffering from brain damage receives an experimental surgical brain implant designed to prevent seizures, which he abuses by triggering for pleasure. Another example is Larry Niven's science fiction writing of wire-heads in his \\"Known Space\\" stories. A somewhat more positive view of brain implants used to communicate with a computer as a form of augmented intelligence is seen in Algis Budrys 1976 novel Michaelmas. Fear that the technology will be misused by the government and military is an early theme. In the 1981 BBC serial The Nightmare Man the pilot of a high-tech mini submarine is linked to his craft via a brain implant but becomes a savage killer after ripping out the implant. Perhaps the most influential novel exploring the world of brain implants was William Gibson's 1984 novel Neuromancer. This was the first novel in a genre that came to be known as \\"cyberpunk\\". It follows a computer hacker through a world where mercenaries are augmented with brain implants to enhance strength, vision, memory, etc. Gibson coins the term \\"matrix\\" and introduces the concept of \\"jacking in\\" with head electrodes or direct implants. He also explores possible entertainment applications of brain implants such as the \\"simstim\\" (simulated stimulation) which is a device used to record and playback experiences. Gibson's work led to an explosion in popular culture references to brain implants. Its influences are felt, for example, in the 1989 roleplaying game Shadowrun, which borrowed his term \\"datajack\\" to describe a brain-computer interface. The implants in Gibson's novels and short stories formed the template for the 1995 film Johnny Mnemonic and later, The Matrix Trilogy. Pulp fiction with implants or brain implants include the novel series Typers, film Spider-Man 2, the TV series Earth: Final Conflict, and numerous computer/video games. * The Gap Cycle (The Gap into): In Stephen R. Donaldson's series of novels, the use (and misuse) of \\"zone implant\\" technology is key to several plotlines. * Ghost in the Shell anime and manga franchise: Cyberbrain neural augmentation technology is the focus. Implants of powerful computers provide vastly increased memory capacity, total recall, as well as the ability to view his or her own memories on an external viewing device.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution, set in 2027, details the impact on society of human augmentation and the controversy it could generate. Several characters in the game have implanted neurochips to aid their professions (or their whims). Examples are of a helicopter pilot with implanted chips to better pilot her aircraft and analyse flight paths, velocity and spatial awareness, a CEO getting an artificial arm to throw a baseball better, as well as a hacker with a brain-computer interface that allows direct access to computer networks and also to act as a 'human proxy' to allow an individual in a remote location to control his actions. :The game raises the question of the downsides of this kind of augmentation as those who cannot afford the enhancements (or object to getting them) rapidly find themselves at a serious disadvantage against people with artificial enhancement of their abilities. The spectre of being forced to have mechanical or electronic enhancements just to get a job is explored as well. The storyline addresses the effect of implant rejection by use of the fictional drug 'Neuropozyne' which breaks down glial tissue and is also fiercely addictive, leaving people who have augmentations little choice but to continue buying the drug from a single biotech corporation who controls the price of it. Without the drug augmented people experience rejection of implants (along with ensuing loss of implant functionality), crippling pain, and possible death.

Othervise, placement and piercing tends to be relatively easy.  Placement  The fourchette piercing is most similar in location to the male guiche piercing. It requires a pinchable flap of skin at the rear rim of the vulva. Piercers should not pierce into the vaginal tissue or vaginal canal as the vaginal tissue often rejects the piercing.  Piercers  Many piercers are not willing to do this piercing. The fourchette is a rare piercing which requires the proper anatomy. Many women do not have the pinchable flap of skin, making the fourchette impossible.  Healing and aftercare  Healing time is relatively quick, as with all piercings in the genital area. Healing time is usually around four to six weeks. Hygiene is usually a concern; with the piercing's proximity to the anus, the wearer must ensure the area is well cleaned following defecation.  Wear  Many wearers have reported that this piercing is prone to stretching on its own. Discomfort with intercourse has been reported by some wearers , whereas some may find it quite pleasurable.

Today it is a commercial port, a famous sea beach, a tourist destination and Maa Khambeswari 9D Cinema(Virtual Reality Show) is most attractive. Gopalpur is around 15 km from Berhampur. The reconstruction of an all weather port including new berths is under development. Demographics As of 2001 India census, Gopalpur had a population of 6663. Males constitute 50% of the population and females 50%. Gopalpur has an average literacy rate of 59%, lower than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 59%, and female literacy is 42%. In Gopalpur, 12% of the population is under 6 years of age. History Gopalpur also has an ancient, commercial port, now lying in ruins. Under the ownership of the Soraine family the village grew in wealth, from an obscure little fishing village, Gopalpur became a prominent trading port. The family built the port, the lighthouse and the Albert Hotel and established both a local fishing industry and a trade route with Burma. They also established the bylaw allowing any villagers who could build a house, with a perimeter and light a fire in the fireplace overnight, could then keep the land and house (on the backwaters) as their own. During the British rule family squabbles and disputes resulted in much being transferred to British missionaries. The Albert Hotel now locked in ownership battles and lying derelict is the last remnant of those squabbles. During the days of British East India Company The East India Company built large warehouses and godowns because the trade with Burma had picked up and it had become a trading point for rice from Rangoon. Victor Soraine returned to India from England and built BetVic house where he retired, surrounded by memories of childhood and his family legacy. His final wish was granted when he was buried in his ancestral lands just a few years ago. Gopalpur has reverted to being a quiet, relaxed place but with one major difference ‚Äî it is one of India's most sought after beaches, with a distinct charm of its own. Beach Panorama view of Gopalpur Sea Beach Barely 16 km away from Brahmapur, the commercial hub of southern Odisha and close to the border of Andhra Pradesh, is the tiny town of Gopalpur on the Bay of Bengal. This languorous beach with coconut groves, casuarinas and gentle sand dunes is deserted for miles. =Development= Entrance to Gopalpur Beach Renovated in the 1970s at the initiative of the Odisha government, the jetties were supposed to revive the trading activities of Gopalpur port. The old jetty in Gopalpur is tourist attraction point, which was a major point for trade and commerce in medieval times. The sailors of those time started their journey from this jetty to Indonesia and Rangoon across the Indian Sea. Once the renovation of new jetty completed it will become an important port of south Odisha. It's a wonderful drive-in for the people and from the beach, a vast expanse of deep blue sea and the horizon can be seen. Another thrilling sight is the long stretch of cashew nut trees. Cashew nuts are processed here and exported. A major landmark of Gopalpur-on-Sea is its lighthouse. The view from the top is splendid and one can see at a glance the entire town of Gopalpur. Gopalour-on-sea is also famous for its 'beach festival' organized annually. A nearby beach is Dhabaleshwar, which also houses temple of the same name. =Beach festival and other attractions near Gopalpur= Gopalpur Beach Festival: The first Gopalpur beach festival was started in the year 1996 by Ganjam District Hotel Association to promote tourism and culture. The concept of Gopalpur Beach Festival was conceived by Mr V.Santosh Kumar and Mr Sayed Rahim Members of Ganjam district Hotel Association, Brahmapur. the Ganjam District Hotel Association and Government of Odisha have been jointly organizing the festival since 1996 in the month of December. Aqua Sports: Renowned Scuba Diver Shabbir Bux has been instrumental in establishing a Training cum fun ride facility on the backwaters of Gopalpur sea. Wind Surfing, Rowing, Scuba Diving, Swimming, Paddle Boat, Water Scooter are some of the major sports and fun rides being provided for tourists as well as professionals. Geography and climate Gopalpur is located at on the coast of Bay of Bengal, around 160 km south of Paradip and 260 km north of Visakhapatnam. It is a natural, deep sea port on the east coast of India. Gopalpur lies on a 4 km stretch of barren coast line, with no mangrove or tropical forests. The coast line falls in the rain-shadow of the region. The climate in the region is tropical wet and dry. Temperatures range from 32 degrees in summer to 17 degrees in winter. The region receives rainfall in both advance and retreat of the Southwest monsoon. Gopalpur has witnessed notable and strong tropical storms in history, including the Super cyclone of 1999 and Cyclone Phailin of 2013, the latter hitting the town directly.

Funding for the TECL programme was sourced by the International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) of the International Labour Organization (ILO), from the US Department of Labor. The first phase of the programme (referred to as TECL I) ran from 2004 to June 2008. The second phase (TECL II) started in March 2009 and run for three years.  South Africa  In South Africa the TECL I was essentially an executing agency for key elements of the national Child Labour Programme of Action, as partner to relevant government Departments, and in collaboration with organised employers, organised labour and NGOs. TECL II involves more limited programme activities with a limited set of government departments and other stakeholder. =Pilot projects= Key projects of TECL I in South Africa were four sets of pilot projects aimed at addressing work-related activities of children that are likely to affect their development detrimentally. The pilot projects address the following three issues or groups of issues, one of which is addressed in this report: *Commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC), Child trafficking and educational rehabilitation of children found in Worst Forms of Child Labour (WFCL). *Children Used By Adults in the Commission of crime (CUBAC). *Delivery of water to households far from sources of safe water. By delivering water to such households, the extremely long periods spent by some children in collecting water could be reduced, thereby making more time available for schooling and other activities. It should also reduce the hazards they are exposed to. The implementation of these pilot projects commenced in late 2005, and they were all concluded in 2007 or 2008. =Other projects= Education policy and child labour Researching child labour in commercial agriculture BLNS Countries: Formulating Action Programmes on the Elimination of Child labour Recent studies have shown that Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland (referred to as the BLNS Countries) all have cases of child labour, although the nature and incidence differ between the countries. See in this regard: *Child labour in Botswana *Child labour in Lesotho *Child labour in Namibia *Child labour in Swaziland. All these countries have ratified the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999, which identifies worst forms of child labour, including the commercial sexual exploitation of children, forced labour, children used by adults in the commission of crime, child trafficking and other forms of very hazardous work. The Convention requires of states that ratify the convention to take immediate ‚Äòtime-bound measures‚Äô to secure the prohibition and elimination of the worst forms of child labour. The countries have some policies and programmes in place to help eliminate child labour, but none of them as yet have comprehensive strategies to address these issues specifically. In 2006-2008 the BLNS countries plan to put in place national Action Programmes on the Elimination of Child Labour (APECs). The process is expected to involve extensive consultation with stakeholders at national level and also in the regions or districts, and is described in more detail below. It is led by the various Ministries responsible for labour and is assisted by the programme Towards the Elimination of the worst forms of Child Labour (TECL). Programme Advisory Committees on Child Labour, representing government departments, organised labour and business, and civil society guide the development and implementation of the programme. =Analysing existing policies= The second phase of the programme will involve the publication of a discussion document on child labour in these countries. It will consolidate information available on child labour in these countries and include an analysis of existing policy and identification of any possible policy gaps. =Consulting stakeholders= The discussion document will form the basis of a detailed consultation process, the third phase of the programme. This will be on what action steps should be put in place in a concerted effort to eliminate child labour, focusing on worst forms of child labour. After having obtained input on suggested actions that should be taken, these proposals will be negotiated directly with the suggested implementing department. The aim will be to draw up a list of actions that will be taken, which implementing agencies have agreed to. =Adopting APECs= All these activities culminated in early 2008 in the national endorsement of Action Programmes on the Elimination of Child Labour (APEC) in Botswana, Namibia and Swaziland. Although endorsed by national forums of stakeholders, including representatives of key government ministries, these programmes are expected to be tabled at cabinet level during 2008. Adoption of the Lesotho APEC is also expected during 2008. Implementation of the action programmes will follow their adoption.

K. Stead, directed by Roger Donaldson, and produced by Donaldson and Larry Parr. Featuring Sam Neill, Clyde Scott and Warren Oates it is notable for being the first feature-length 35mm film produced entirely in New Zealand. The film was a major success critically and commercially and launched the career of Sam Neill, who later went on to do international works such as Jurassic Park, The Piano, Hunt for The Wilderpeople, and Peaky Blinders. A political thriller with action film elements, it follows the lead character \\"Smith\\" (Neill) as New Zealand plunges into a police state as a fascist government institutes martial law after industrial disputes flare into violence. Smith gets caught between the special police and a growing resistance movement and reluctantly becomes involved. Often named one of the best New Zealand films of all time, it is considered a classic and a landmark in the new wave of cinema in the country, helping to change New Zealand cinema from small, melodramatic, derivative films to the modern reels that make the country known in the industry today. Plot Following the break-up of his marriage caused by his wife's affair with another man named Bullen, Smith arranges to live on the Coromandel Peninsula on an island owned by a Maori tribe. Meanwhile, political tension escalates as an oil embargo leaves the country in an energy crisis. Tension boils over into a civil war and guerrilla activity. However, Smith and his dog enjoy peaceful island life, having little interaction with the rest of society. Smith's idyllic life is shattered when a bomb is exploded in a nearby town, and police arrive on his island to arrest him and search for illegal weapons. After they find a cache of explosives that Smith had been unaware of, he is taken to a police station where he is imprisoned, interrogated and tortured. The dog is last seen swimming after the boat that Smith is being taken away in. Smith recognizes one policeman as a former schoolmate, Jesperson, who then takes over the interrogation. Jesperson reveals that the Government regard Smith as a key leader of the guerillas and offers expulsion from New Zealand in return for a confession, or alternatively trial by a military tribunal with a likely death sentence. During a prison transfer, Smith deliberately forces himself to vomit to confuse his captors and escapes. He then flees the city, finding work at a small campground and love with a local girl. Happy to be outside the civil war again, Smith blends in until a US Army unit arrives and takes over the campground. Smith clashes with Willoughby, the commander of the US forces, who suspects Smith of being a rebel sympathiser. The arrival of Bullen, who is now a senior leader of the underground guerrilla movement, complicates matters further. As the US forces capture and kill more rebels, Smith is unwillingly drawn into participating in an attack on the military unit by Bullen. Fleeing the scene of the successful attack, Smith and Bullen are pursued by Government forces and cornered in a nearby forest. After Government forces surround the guerrillas and bomb their encampment, Smith and Bullen escape, only to be cornered by Jesperson and his elite squad. After Bullen is fatally wounded, Smithwishing an end to what is happeningdeliberately provokes Jesperson into shooting him.

When Neill's stunt double ran from the van, an off-duty police officer tackled him, mistaking the stuntman for a real criminal attempting to escape custody. The stuntman had to point out the camera crew to get the officer to release him. In the scene where Warren Oates steps out of his jeep and meets \\"Smith\\", he is actually holding a page of the script, fearing that he'd forget the lines. Oates acted as if the paper was a list of directions to the motel. The riot scenes in which police with batons and shields beat back protestors closely mirrored actions of police and protestors four years later during the 1981 South African National Rugby team ‚Äì the Springboks' ‚Äì tour in New Zealand, which sparked anti-apartheid protests. RNZAF A-4 Skyhawks also featured in the film courtesy of the permission obtained through AVM Siegert.

It was held on July 4, 1923, in the town of Shelby, Montana, USA. Before the fight In 1922, oil was discovered in Shelby, making it the only city in northern Montana to have the material. Because of the California economy and the influence of the Hollywood film industry, many people traveled west with dreams of becoming rich and famous. Shelby had a train service, and the town's officials thought it would be wise to try to make the city an economic and tourist center. The money would be provided by revenues that the oil found in the area would bring. Multiple bank branches had opened there since the discovery, and many families would move in, or, at least, pass by and spend their money as tourists, according to plans. The first stage on this plan, which failed in great part because of the Dempsey vs. Gibbons fight, was to bring a fight for the world heavyweight boxing title to town. Dempsey was a member of the Big Five, alongside Red Grange, Bobby Jones, Bill Tilden and Babe Ruth. Being an idol all over the United States made Dempsey an attraction. The fact that his manager, Jack Kearns, and his promoter, Tex Rickard, to whom many refer today as the Don King of his era, were also famous, made city officials even more convinced that a large crowd would visit Shelby for the fight, in hopes of seeing Kearns and Rickard as well as the fight. Shelby also figured people would be attracted to running into Dempsey in town, or maybe another member of the Big Five, should they make it to Montana to see the fight. There were no television networks so whoever wanted to see the fight live would have to go to Shelby. Officials chose Tommy Gibbons, whose brother Mike was better known as a former world champion, to challenge Dempsey. But Gibbons proved the plan's first failure, as he was unknown except to boxing fans. Gibbons was strong, but not in Dempsey's level. Thinking patriotism would play a part in the promotion, the city chose July 4, the United States' independence day. A large arena was built over a farm. The area is now known as Champion's Field. Kearns asked Shelby officials to guarantee him and the champion an advance for their traveling costs, as airplanes were available at the time but not safe, and train travel to Montana from the more populated areas of the United States took up to a week (it is said that Dempsey and Kearns took a week to get there by train). He also asked for the champion to have a guaranteed purse. So Kearns convinced Shelby to commit money or lose the fight to somewhere else. Gibbons, while not a champion, was a professional and he needed money as well. He reportedly took 150,000 dollars to fight Dempsey. Shelby officials, again believing they would be the beneficiaries, agreed to every demand by both boxers and their management and promotional teams. Area banks were to provide the money to stage the event. Dempsey was received at the train station by thousands of residents, which gave the city officials even more hope that the fight would be a success. The fight The fight was scheduled for the then almost regular distance of 15 rounds. Dempsey was considered an aggressor: He had dropped Jess Willard seven times in the first round before winning the title from Willard by stopping him in round three, retaining the title with knockouts over Bill Brennan and Georges Carpentier, among others. Because of this, the fight was thought to be a possible action bout, but instead it was quite strategic. Dempsey constantly threw punches to Gibbons' head, with Gibbons trying to attack Dempsey's body. As a consequence, Gibbons was able to duck many of Dempsey's shots. Dempsey's mobility, however, made it hard for Gibbons to punch Dempsey's stomach and ribs. There were some isolated moments of action: Dempsey is said to have had Gibbons hurt in round seven, but he could not score a knockout. Gibbons landed hard punches to Dempsey's chin once in a while, but Dempsey shrugged the punches off. In the end, Dempsey retained the title with a 15-round unanimous decision. Aftermath The aftermath was worse than the fight for Shelby: a large arena, the size of a football field, had been built. Since most of Shelby's residents and those of nearby cities could not afford ticket prices set so that the city could come up with the money guaranteed to the participants, only 7,702 paying fans showed up, making the fight one of the biggest economical disasters in boxing history. An estimated 13,000 people got to see the fight free. Four banks in Shelby went bankrupt in the months following the fight. The town's dreams of prosperity went away with them. Stampede Taking advantage of the crowds brought to town for the boxing match, two rodeos were held. One rodeo was produced by the Knight and Day Stampede Company out of Alberta, as the Shelby Stampede and was staged in the world's largest rodeo arena. This rodeo arena was built in a circular design that had seating for 20,000 people. The Knight and Day Stampede Company was a partnership between millionaire ranchers Raymond Knight of Raymond, Alberta and Addison Day of Medicine Hat, Alberta. Another rodeo, the Marias Fair and Rodeo was held at the same time but on the other side of town. These rodeos, like the boxing match, were not financially successful. The world's largest rodeo arena was torn down after the crowds went home. Shelby Town Hall A town hall building for Shelby was built in just two months in 1923 to serve as headquarters for media for the fight. The building survives and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

He played for Australia in three Summer Olympics qualification tournaments, between 1960 and 1968, and was the head coach of the senior Australian basketball team at four Summer Olympics, between 1972 and 1984. Gaze also coached the Melbourne Tigers for 35 years, including 22 seasons in the National Basketball League (NBL), winning two league championships, in 1993 and 1997. He was the NBL Coach of the Year in 1989, 1997 and 1999, and is second all-time in the number of coaching wins in that league. Gaze is a member of the Australian Basketball Hall of Fame, as both a player and coach, and is an associate member of the Sport Australia Hall of Fame. He has also been inducted into both the FIBA Hall of Fame and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as a coach. Personal life Gaze is the son of Albert J. Gaze and Avis M. Gaze. He has two older brothers, Barry and Tony, who is a former coach of the Australian national women's basketball team, the Opals. He married Margaret in 1962, with the couple having a daughter, Janet Gaze-Daniels (born 8 July 1964), who works in recreation management, and a son, Australian basketball legend Andrew Gaze (born 24 July 1965). As the GM of the Victorian Basketball Association (until his retirement), the Gaze family lived in the official GM's residence, which was attached to the back of the Albert Park Basketball Stadium. Gaze's nephew, Mark (Tony's son), played for Australia, under Lindsay's coaching, at the 1982 FIBA World Championship and went on to play in 182 NBL, games from 1983 to 1991. He is also the great-uncle of Mark Gaze's daughter, Kate Gaze, who played for the Canberra Capitals, in Australia's Women's National Basketball League. Lindsay Gaze and his brothers were raised by his mother, after his parents separated soon after moving from Adelaide to Melbourne, in the early 1940s. As a youth, he played tennis, basketball and Australian rules football and was his school captain in tennis and football. Lindsay and Barry Gaze played in the Victorian Football Association for Prahran, and they were both selected as members of an Australian rules team that played an exhibition match during the 1956 Melbourne Summer Olympics, although Lindsay didn't take the field. Olympic career It was in basketball that Gaze would make his mark in the Summer Olympic Games. In 1958, he chose to pursue a career in basketball, rather than football (and a promising engineering career) and although still playing, became the first full-time basketball administrator of the Victorian Basketball Association, accepting the position of General Manager. Lindsay Gaze held the position until his retirement in 2005, during which time the number of registered players in Victoria rose from around 2,000 in 1958 to over 200,000. He was selected for the senior Australian basketball team for the 1960 Bologna Pre-Olympic Tournament, which was the first Australian basketball team to travel overseas to compete for a place at the Summer Olympics. Gaze soon established himself as one of Australia's leading basketball players, establishing an international reputation, when he was selected as a member of the All-Star Five at the 1962 Philippines Invitational Basketball Tournament. Gaze represented Australia during the 1960 Bologna, 1964 Yokohama, and 1968 Monterrey Summer Olympics world qualification tournaments, but Australia only qualified to compete at the 1964 Games. He developed a reputation as a fanatical trainer, training two or three times a week with his club and at home. Gaze also coached the Australian national under-16 and under-18 squads, during his playing career. His reputation for training led to his appointment as a coach of the Melbourne Tigers (MBA) in 1970, and also of the senior men's Australian basketball side in 1971, which he went on to coach at four Summer Olympic Games, in 1972, 1976, 1980 and 1984. His son, Andrew, was a part of the team that he coached in 1984. Lindsay Gaze would write his first book, Better Basketball, in 1977. Lindsay was a part of every Australian Boomers' Olympics team as a player or coach, from 1960 to 1984. He covered each of the campaigns, year by year, on the Aussie Hoopla podcast.Lindsay Gaze on the history of the Australian Boomers. NBL coaching career 1983‚Äì2005 Gaze was the inaugural head coach of the Melbourne Tigers, at the start of the NBL, in 1984. He retired in May 2005, after coaching the team for 22 seasons. He coached in a total of 651 games, and recorded 339 victories. The Melbourne Tigers won two NBL championships, in 1993 and 1997, with Gaze as the club's head coach. He was a widely respected coach in the NBL, winning the league's Coach of the Year award three times during his career. He announced his retirement from coaching basketball, on the same day that his son, Andrew Gaze, announced his retirement from playing basketball, after having played in 612 NBL games. Lindsay Gaze had coached Andrew Gaze during his son's entire career as an NBL player, with the pair forming the longest standing father-son partnership in the history of world sport. The pair would also author a book titled, Winning Basketball, in 1992. Lindsay Gaze was also a member of the NBL Board. In 2004, he became a part owner of the Melbourne Tigers, along with Andrew Gaze. At his retirement, journalist Stephen Howell of the Melbourne Age, wrote that history would judge him as, the most influential figure in Australian basketball. CBA coaching career Gaze was announced as the head coach of the Tianjin Ronggang, of the Chinese CBA, for the 2008‚Äì09 season.

The game uses the graphical style and various story elements from Metroid Prime. It was developed by Fuse Games for the Nintendo DS handheld game console, and released by Nintendo in North America and Australia in 2005, in Japan in 2006, and in Europe in 2007. Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, along with typical pinball items. New mechanics are introduced, such as wall jumping and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be nudged with a finger to alter the pinball's trajectory while in motion. The initial idea for a video game that presented the Metroid series in a pinball setting came to Kensuke Tanabe after he learned that Fuse Games had previously worked on Mario Pinball Land, another pinball video game. Recalling that the series' protagonist, Samus, can morph into a ball, Tanabe was convinced that the Metroid universe could be adapted to a pinball setting. The game was sold with a Rumble Pak accessory for the Nintendo DS, marking the first time the accessory was available for the Nintendo DS. Metroid Prime Pinball received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's transposition of the Metroid series into a pinball video game, but criticized its lack of variety. Metroid Prime Pinball sold 6,228 copies during its debut month of October 2005 in the United States, and over 15,000 units in Japan as of May 2008. Gameplay alt=Two screens, one above the other. A pinball machine is split between the two; a scoreboard is in the bottom screen. Metroid Prime Pinball uses the basic mechanics of pinball, complete with an assortment of typical pinball items including flippers, spinners, bumpers, and ramps. In addition, new mechanics are introduced, such as enemies that wander around the table, wall jumping, and the ability to fire weapons. The Nintendo DS's touchscreen can be used to nudge the pinball table and alter the ball's trajectory. The game consists of six pinball tables, each inspired by a different area of Metroid Prime. Each table is shown across both screens of the Nintendo DS. Only two tables are initially available for play: Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld. After playing either of the first two tables, the player unlocks two more tables: Phendrana Drifts and Phazon Mines. In either table, the player must battle a boss to complete it. During the course of the game, the player must acquire twelve Artifacts, which are prizes that are awarded after completing objectives such as winning minigames or beating bosses. Once having acquired twelve Artifacts, the player is granted access to a table called the Artifact Temple, which places six balls on the table at the same time. To complete the table, twelve different targets must be hit with the balls while they are bombarded by attacks from Meta Ridley, one of the antagonists of the Metroid Prime series. If all of the balls are lost, the table ends; the player does not lose any of the twelve Artifacts already collected but is forced to revisit another table and complete it before being allowed a second attempt at the Artifact Temple. Upon completing the Artifact Temple, access is granted to the final table, Impact Crater. After the player defeats the Metroid Prime creature on the Impact Crater table, the game unlocks a higher difficulty level, Expert mode. The game also features a \\"Single Mission\\" mode which confines players to a single board. The Pirate Frigate and Tallon Overworld boards challenge players to earn a high point score, as in real pinball; on the other tables players are ranked by the time taken to complete a mission. In addition to the single-player mode, the game features a multiplayer mode, which requires only one copy of the game and allows up to eight players to compete in a race to reach a target score. The mode uses a seventh table, Magmoor Caverns, that does not appear in the single-player mode. Development alt=A portrait of Kensuke Tanabe. While making Metroid Prime Hunters, a Metroid first-person shooter video game for the Nintendo DS, Nintendo producer Kensuke Tanabe came up with the idea to make a pinball game based on the Metroid series as Fuse Games finished Mario Pinball Land, another pinball simulator based on a Nintendo property. Tanabe felt like the Metroid universe fit into such a setting due to series protagonist Samus being able to morph into a ball, and Fuse agreed that the license was \\"a great fit for pinball\\", accepting to work on the game. Fuse Games then received some assets from Metroid Prime developers Retro Studios, and collaborated with the Hunters team at Nintendo Software Technology to elaborate on specific aspects of Metroid Prime Pinball, such as Samus's wall climbing and shooting abilities. Head of development Adrian Barritt said that in Metroid Prime Pinball the team tried to fix criticisms raised about the difficulty of Mario Pinball Land, creating a \\"more beginner friendly\\" game. Named Project Code: Metroid Pinball while in development, the first gameplay footage from the game was released on May 17, 2005 at the E3 convention. Nintendo of America revealed on August 22, 2005 that the game, by then titled Metroid Prime Pinball, would be sold with the Rumble Pak accessory, which can be plugged into the Game Boy Advance slot of the Nintendo DS. When the Rumble Pak is installed, the Nintendo DS shakes whenever the pinball in the game hits an object. This was the first time that the Nintendo DS version of the Rumble Pak was introduced. It was first sold exclusively with Metroid Prime Pinball before becoming available as a standalone product from Nintendo. Nintendo DS games that use the device's top and bottom screens as one continuous screen are harder to control because of a gap in the middle, sometimes called a visual \\"dead zone\\"; objects in this area are not visible. The developers of Metroid Prime Pinball, a game which takes advantage of both screens, resolved this problem by placing a second set of pinball flippers at the bottom of the upper screen to give players a reference to work with. The tabletops in the game use pre-rendered artwork for graphical effects, including Samus's Morph Ball, which uses renderings of images at several different angles to provide a smooth animation. To simulate the appearance of a real pinball game from a player's point of view, the tabletop in Metroid Prime Pinball was tipped back. The game offers players the ability to nudge the table, a technique used in pinball games to influence the ball's movement. This is achieved by touching the Nintendo DS's bottom touchscreen with a finger and pushing it in the direction that the player wants to nudge the tabletop. The game's soundtrack was composed by Kenji Yamamoto and Masaru Tajima, with audio effects from the Metroid Prime series are borrowed by the game to provide a \\"CD-like\\" music experience. The voice of the Power Suit was provided by Lorelei King. Reception Metroid Prime Pinball was released by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in North America on October 24, 2005, in Australia on December 1, in Japan on January 19, 2006, and in Europe on June 22, 2007. 6,228 copies were sold during its debut month of October 2005 in the United States, and over 15,000 units were sold in Japan as of May 2008. It was given \\"generally favorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregator website Metacritic. Despite early skepticism over the quality of a pinball video game themed after the Metroid series, reviews praised the integration of the two in Metroid Prime Pinball. Nintendo Power called the game a \\"fully realized and well-tuned hybrid of pinball play and Metroid Prime atmosphere\\", and the Official Nintendo Magazine named it one of the better recently released pinball games. GameZone believed that the game appeals to anyone who is a fan of pinball games or the Metroid Prime franchise, to which Play magazine attested, adding that the game embodies the Metroid Prime series well. Appreciating the game's pinball gameplay, 1UP.com thought that its Metroid motif did not add much more to the game. Nintendo World Report felt differently; they were impressed with the game's \\"top-notch graphics and sound that believably invoke the Metroid series\\". They also appreciated the pinball innovations introduced in the game that incorporate features from the series, concluding, \\"This game really does feel like a seamless, if unlikely, merging between classic arcade pinball and the creepy-cool Metroid Prime series.\\" The sentiment was shared by GameSpot's Greg Kasavin, who was convinced that pinball was an excellent medium to simulate the challenging struggles found in the Metroid series, noting that the game \\"pulls it off very well\\" by being faithful to the main series. Bryn Williams of GameSpy was impressed after playing the game; he noted that it was one of the more interesting gaming sessions that anyone can have on the Nintendo DS. Metroid Prime Pinballs gameplay was lauded by reviewers. Craig Harris of IGN appreciated Fuse Games' work on the game, praising the graphics, audio, and gameplay, along with its \\"pick-up-and-play\\" element that made it easy for people with varying levels of skill to play. X-Play felt the same way, noting that the simple controls and \\"short bursts of gameplay\\" make Metroid Prime Pinball a perfect handheld video game. In addition, they asserted that the game has great value because of the included wireless multiplayer mode, which allows up to eight players to play the game with just one game card. A few critics were negative about Metroid Prime Pinball. The reviewer from the Electronic Gaming Monthly video game magazine found it hard to see the pinball while playing the game, especially when it was in the area between the top and bottom Nintendo DS screens. With a limited selection of game modes, GamePros Rice Burner was disappointed with the game, and concluded that because every game mode features the same tabletops, Metroid Prime Pinball lacked variety, which Game Informers reviewer agreed with, noting that he would have had more fun with the game if he \\"had access to a little more content\\". The minigames were criticized by Game Revolution, which claimed that there were too many minigames that were only of average quality. Furthermore, it asked the game's developer, Fuse Games, to spend more time making a great pinball game rather than several minor minigames, requesting \\"a character- based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none\\". Eurogamer had a different experience, finding that the minigames provided more entertainment than the main game, which they remarked was a \\"cardinal sin in pinball\\". They also criticized the tilt feature for being unintuitive and difficult to use. The reviewer for GamesMaster felt that Metroid Prime Pinball was directed more towards Metroid fans than pinball aficionados, calling it a \\"flashy but insipid\\" game.

The real and imaginary parts of permittivity are shown, and various processes are depicted: ionic and dipolar relaxation, and atomic and electronic resonances at higher energies.From the Dielectric spectroscopy page of the research group of Dr. Kenneth A. Mauritz. Dielectric spectroscopy (which falls in a subcategory of impedance spectroscopy) measures the dielectric properties of a medium as a function of frequency.Kremer F., Schonhals A., Luck W. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy. ‚Äì Springer-Verlag, 2002.Sidorovich A. M., Dielectric Spectrum of Water. ‚Äì Ukrainian Physical Journal, 1984, vol. 29, No 8, p. 1175-1181 (In Russian).Hippel A.

S., Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy of Solids. ‚Äì Radiophysics and Quantum Electronics, 2003, vol. 46, Issue 8, p. 657‚Äì665. It is based on the interaction of an external field with the electric dipole moment of the sample, often expressed by permittivity. It is also an experimental method of characterizing electrochemical systems. This technique measures the impedance of a system over a range of frequencies, and therefore the frequency response of the system, including the energy storage and dissipation properties, is revealed. Often, data obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is expressed graphically in a Bode plot or a Nyquist plot. Impedance is the opposition to the flow of alternating current (AC) in a complex system. A passive complex electrical system comprises both energy dissipater (resistor) and energy storage (capacitor) elements. If the system is purely resistive, then the opposition to AC or direct current (DC) is simply resistance. Materials or systems exhibiting multiple phases (such as composites or heterogeneous materials) commonly show a universal dielectric response, whereby dielectric spectroscopy reveals a power law relationship between the impedance (or the inverse term, admittance) and the frequency, œâ, of the applied AC field. Almost any physico- chemical system, such as electrochemical cells, mass-beam oscillators, and even biological tissue possesses energy storage and dissipation properties. EIS examines them. This technique has grown tremendously in stature over the past few years and is now being widely employed in a wide variety of scientific fields such as fuel cell testing, biomolecular interaction, and microstructural characterization. Often, EIS reveals information about the reaction mechanism of an electrochemical process: different reaction steps will dominate at certain frequencies, and the frequency response shown by EIS can help identify the rate limiting step. Dielectric mechanisms Dielectrics spectroscopy machine There are a number of different dielectric mechanisms, connected to the way a studied medium reacts to the applied field (see the figure illustration). Each dielectric mechanism is centered around its characteristic frequency, which is the reciprocal of the characteristic time of the process. In general, dielectric mechanisms can be divided into relaxation and resonance processes. The most common, starting from high frequencies, are: =Electronic polarization= This resonant process occurs in a neutral atom when the electric field displaces the electron density relative to the nucleus it surrounds. This displacement occurs due to the equilibrium between restoration and electric forces. Electronic polarization may be understood by assuming an atom as a point nucleus surrounded by spherical electron cloud of uniform charge density. =Atomic polarization= Atomic polarization is observed when the nucleus of the atom reorients in response to the electric field. This is a resonant process. Atomic polarization is intrinsic to the nature of the atom and is a consequence of an applied field. Electronic polarization refers to the electron density and is a consequence of an applied field. Atomic polarization is usually small compared to electronic polarization. =Dipole relaxation= This originates from permanent and induced dipoles aligning to an electric field. Their orientation polarisation is disturbed by thermal noise (which mis-aligns the dipole vectors from the direction of the field), and the time needed for dipoles to relax is determined by the local viscosity. These two facts make dipole relaxation heavily dependent on temperature, pressure,Floudas G., Paluch, M., Grzybowski A., Ngai K. L. Molecular Dynamics of Glass-Forming Systems - Effects of Pressure. Springer-Verlag, 2011. and chemical surrounding. =Ionic relaxation= Ionic relaxation comprises ionic conductivity and interfacial and space charge relaxation. Ionic conductivity predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. Interfacial relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) lead to a separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the dielectric loss that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations. =Dielectric relaxation= Dielectric relaxation as a whole is the result of the movement of dipoles (dipole relaxation) and electric charges (ionic relaxation) due to an applied alternating field, and is usually observed in the frequency range 102-1010 Hz. Relaxation mechanisms are relatively slow compared to resonant electronic transitions or molecular vibrations, which usually have frequencies above 1012 Hz. Principles =Steady-state= For a redox reaction R \\\\leftrightarrow O + e, without mass-transfer limitation, the relationship between the current density and the electrode overpotential is given by the Butler‚ÄìVolmer equation: : j_{\\\\text{t}}=j_0\\\\left(\\\\exp(\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}}\\\\,f\\\\, \\\\eta)-\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}}\\\\,f\\\\,\\\\eta)\\\\right) with : \\\\eta=E-E_{\\\\text{eq}} ,\\\\;f=F/(R\\\\,T),\\\\;\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}}+\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}}=1. :j_0 is the exchange current density and \\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}} and \\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}} are the symmetry factors. Fig. 1: Steady-state current density vs. overpotential for a redox reaction The curve j_{\\\\text{t}}\\\\; vs.\\\\; E is not a straight line (Fig. 1), therefore a redox reaction is not a linear system.Linear vs. non-linear systems in impedance measurements = Dynamic behavior = Faradaic impedance In an electrochemical cell the faradaic impedance of an electrolyte-electrode interface is the joint electrical resistance and capacitance at that interface. Let us suppose that the Butler-Volmer relationship correctly describes the dynamic behavior of the redox reaction: : j_{\\\\text{t}}(t)=j_{\\\\text{t}}(\\\\eta(t))=j_0\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\exp(\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}}\\\\,f\\\\, \\\\eta(t))-\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}}\\\\,f\\\\,\\\\eta(t))\\\\right) Dynamic behavior of the redox reaction is characterized by the so-called charge transfer resistance defined by: : R_{\\\\text{ct}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\partial j_{\\\\text{t}}/\\\\partial \\\\eta }= \\\\frac{1}{f\\\\,j_0\\\\,\\\\left(\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}}\\\\,\\\\exp(\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{o}}\\\\,f\\\\, \\\\eta)+\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}}\\\\,\\\\exp(-\\\\alpha_{\\\\text{r}}\\\\,f\\\\, \\\\eta) \\\\right)} The value of the charge transfer resistance changes with the overpotential. For this simplest example the faradaic impedance is reduced to a resistance. It is worthwhile to notice that: : R_{\\\\text{ct}} = \\\\frac{1}{f\\\\,j_0} for \\\\eta = 0.  Double layer capacitance  An electrode  electrolyte interface behaves like a capacitance called electrochemical double-layer capacitance C_{\\\\text{dl}}. The equivalent circuit for the redox reaction in Fig. 2 includes the double-layer capacitance as well as the charge transfer resistance. Another analog circuit commonly used to model the electrochemical double-layer is called a constant phase element. Fig. 2: Equivalent circuit for a redoxin reaction without mass-transfer limitation The electrical impedance of this circuit is easily obtained remembering the impedance of a capacitance which is given by: :Z_{\\\\text{dl}}(\\\\omega) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{i}\\\\,\\\\omega\\\\, C_{\\\\text{dl}}} where \\\\omega is the angular frequency of a sinusoidal signal (rad/s), and \\\\scriptstyle{ \\\\text{i}^2=-1}. It is obtained: :Z(\\\\omega)=\\\\frac{R_{\\\\text{t}}}{1+R_{\\\\text{t}}\\\\,C_{\\\\text{dl}}\\\\,\\\\text{i} \\\\,\\\\omega} Nyquist diagram of the impedance of the circuit shown in Fig. 3 is a semicircle with a diameter \\\\scriptstyle{R_{\\\\text{t}}} and an angular frequency at the apex equal to \\\\scriptstyle{1/(R_{\\\\text{t}}\\\\,C_{\\\\text{dc}})} (Fig. 3). Other representations, Bode plots, or Black plans can be used. Fig. 3: Electrochemists Nyquist diagram of a RC parallel circuit. The arrow indicates increasing angular frequencies.  Ohmic resistance  The ohmic resistance R_\\\\Omega appears in series with the electrode impedance of the reaction and the Nyquist diagram is translated to the right. =Universal dielectric response= Under AC conditions with varying frequency œâ, heterogeneous systems and composite materials exhibit a universal dielectric response, in which overall admittance exhibits a region of power law scaling with frequency. Y\\\\propto\\\\omega^{\\\\alpha} . Measurement of the impedance parameters Plotting the Nyquist diagram with a potentiostatImpedance, admittance, Nyquist, Bode, Black, etc. and an impedance analyzer, most often included in modern potentiostats, allows the user to determine charge transfer resistance, double layer capacitance and ohmic resistance. The exchange current density j_0 can be easily determined measuring the impedance of a redox reaction for \\\\eta=0. Nyquist diagrams are made of several arcs for reactions more complex than redox reactions and with mass-transfer limitations. Applications Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is used in a wide range of applications. In the paint and coatings industry, it is a useful tool to investigate the quality of coatings and to detect the presence of corrosion. It is used in many biosensor systems as a label-free technique to measure bacterial concentration and to detect dangerous pathogens such as Escherichia Coli O157:H7 and Salmonella, and yeast cells. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy is also used to analyze and characterize different food products. Some examples are the assessment of food‚Äìpackage interactions, the analysis of milk composition, the characterization and the determination of the freezing end-point of ice-cream mixes, the measure of meat ageing, the investigation of ripeness and quality in fruits and the determination of free acidity in olive oil. In the field of human health monitoring is better known as bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) and is used to estimate body composition as well as different parameters such as total body water and free fat mass. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy can be used to obtain the frequency response of batteries. Biomedical sensors working in the microwave range relies on dielectric spectroscopy to detect changes in the dielectric properties over a frequency range. The IFAC database can be used as a resource to get the dielectric properties for human body tissues. For heterogenous mixtures like suspensions impedance spectroscopy can be used to monitor the particle sedimentation process.

Therefore, the rules of the road in China are understood to mean both the codified and uncodified practices, procedures and norms of behavior generally followed by motorists, cyclists and pedestrians in the mainland of China. Legal Background The first traffic regulations for China went into effect on August 6, 1955. 59 articles formed the City Traffic Regulations (), promulgated by the Ministry of Public Security of the People's Republic of China. It was vague and terse, however, and punishments for violators were relatively light. In 1988 the regulations were revisited, but the result was still a traffic administrative regulation (‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÈÅìË∑Ø‰∫§ÈÄöÁÆ°ÁêÜÊù°‰æã). There still was no law to control traffic. The first expressway traffic regulations surfaced on March 26, 1990, under the title Interim Regulations for Expressways. These were strengthened later on in the 1990s, when a new regulation (albeit temporary) took effect, banning \\"new drivers\\" (PRC licence holders for less than a year) from the expressways. The Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China represented a huge breakthrough. It instituted higher fines, compulsory vehicle insurance, and a point system for penalties, among other reforms. The bill was passed with Hu Jintao in power in late October 2003 and took effect on all of mainland China on May 1, 2004. Drive on the Right Except for a brief period during the Cultural Revolution (1966‚Äì1976) when the government encouraged people to drive on the left (for symbolic/ideological reasons), the convention has been to drive on the right. In practice, however, driving to the left into oncoming traffic is not uncommon in China, nor is it as stigmatized and penalized as it is in other countries. This is especially true of bicyclists, electric bicycles, and motorcycles who--unless physically prevented by barriers--are almost equally likely to be found riding on the right, left or straight down the middle of lanes of traffic. Right-of-way Right-of-way (Simplified Chinese: ÂÖàË°åÊùÉ, Pinyin: xiƒÅnx√≠ngqu√°n, Lit: ‚Äúfirst go rights‚Äù) is defined as such in all Chinese dictionaries, however, most Chinese drivers‚Äô understanding of this concept is markedly different from those in societies with a strong tradition of the rule of law. Compared to the western understanding of right- of-way, which refers to the legal right to proceed forward in a vehicle without fear of being found at fault for causing a collision, right-of-way in China means, for all intents and purposes, that the person who is in the way (first) has the right unless road signs otherwise dictate. In practice, this translates into motorists and cyclists turning or merging straight into the path of other traffic believing that the onus is on the other person to avoid a collision. When the right-of-way is unclear (such as at unmarked intersections) it is common practice for drivers in many parts of the world to make eye contact with each other and use nods or hand gestures to either exert or defer right-of-way. The opposite applies in China, where people actively avoid eye contact, and in fact turn away from the person whose progress they are impeding so as to communicate their intention to proceed regardless. Stop and go Given the relatively recent introduction of a law technically requiring motorists to stop at a red light, it is not surprising that drivers frequently disregard traffic lights and proceed on red. The frequency of this occurrence varies according to time and place. A crowded intersection at midday with police presence results in drivers diligently observing the law, while a desolate intersection at 1 A.M. is sure to witness cars and trucks speeding through red lights without pause. Pedestrians are especially in a difficult situation. In cities such as Beijing, new \\"self-service\\" traffic lights provide pedestrians with easy access across the road‚Äîjust push a button, wait, and go when the light changes. Unfortunately, unless these traffic lights come with supervising cameras connected to the police, some drivers are likely to pass through these as well, making the pedestrian buttons rather pointless. Crossings with no camera of any kind are likely to have chaotic traffic, as neither police nor technology are present to enforce the law. A substantial change in the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China is a new requirement which forces drivers to stop at red lights even if there is a crossing only to the left (no crossing to the right), thereby outlawing straight-ahead at red lights that was permitted at an intersection with no crossing to the right. Drivers, however, still can turn right at red lights, unless signs prohibit this. Finally, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, some battalions of Red Guards would gather at traffic lights, forcing drivers to stop at the green light and go once it had turned red ‚Äì supposedly because red was the colour of Communism. Due to some traffic light systems being unmanned, drivers at these crossings would often go at the green light ‚Äì causing collisions where a neighboring lights system was hijacked and all the drivers were going at red. Officially, the idea of \\"Red lights mean go\\" was never adopted by the regime. Pedestrians and bicyclists A long-standing tenet has been for the larger vehicle involved in a collision to assume responsibility, e.g., if a car collides with a bicycle the car driver is at fault. If a bicycle and pedestrian collide it is the bicyclist's fault. Practically, this understanding emboldens pedestrians and cyclists to take liberties with cars and trucks, impeding their progress by moving into the flow of traffic under the assumption that larger vehicles will give way. This notwithstanding, the incidence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions is on the decline, despite the fact that the new Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China allows for only one case in which drivers are not at fault for hitting a pedestrian‚Äîthat is, if the pedestrian purposely violates traffic laws. In highly regulated cities, that employ thousands of traffic cameras and facial recognition technology, drivers are highly considerate to pedestrians. In crosswalks without traffic lights, drivers will come to a stop for pedestrians. Besides government-led enforcement measures, a report-for-reward program exists whereby persons reporting traffic offences will receive a reward upon successful conviction (often 20-100 CNY). Given high proliferation of smartphones, reporting rates are high. In most towns and cities without much oversight, very few drivers will slow down when approaching a pedestrian crossing. Even fewer will actually stop for pedestrians waiting to pass by. Road rage in China Road rage is uncommon in China. This is possibly because Chinese motorists have fewer expectations that other drivers will offer to \\"give way\\" and have a less legalistic/absolute view of traffic procedures. Road rage is not completely absent, however. A few cases have been witnessed in Beijing: they include assault with golf clubs, car chases and the like. Sometimes the police will intervene; those who commit extreme physical assault can often expect to be prosecuted criminally. In compliance with the Chinese criminal code, a case of road rage resulting in death will often see the offender receive the death penalty. A recent example was the Yao Jiaxin murder case. Traffic collisions and conflict resolution Officially, all traffic collisions must be reported to the police. Exempt are cases where only minor damage was done to the vehicle, with nobody hurt, injured or killed. Cases of self-damage (e.g., driving into a tree) officially need to be reported to the police, but in reality, few people bother. This, however, indicates a waiver of responsibility for the insurance company. When a collision occurs between two vehicles it is almost always resolved by the payment of money by one party to the other on the spot, with or without any admission of fault. After initial indignation or recalcitrance, one or both parties will demand financial compensation. It is supposed that either party considers the socio-economic status and occupation of the other, and the desirability of saving face. Eventually one party will relent, and they will bargain down to an agreeable amount of compensation. Another feature of a traffic collision in China is that in many cases, neither party will move their vehicle from the position that it came to rest following the collision, regardless of its effect on the flow of traffic. It is a justifiable fear of many Chinese motorists not to move their vehicle from the scene of a collision because recent traffic law changes have provided for hefty penalties in the event of a hit-and-run. A driver found guilty of hit-and-run forfeits his or her license for life, and any party to a collision who flees the scene is subject to severe sanctions. Military vehicles A vehicle with a government or military plate are not subject to the Road Traffic Safety Law of the People's Republic of China (‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩÈÅìË∑Ø‰∫§ÈÄöÂÆâÂÖ®Ê≥ï); they may run red lights, drive in the wrong direction or weave in and out of traffic.Fauna, 1 December 2009, Caught: Fake Chinese Military Vehicle License Plates, ChinaSMACK Communist party officials and People's Liberation Army members are also exempt from paying road tolls and adhering to parking regulations.Wu Zhong, 21 November 2007, Drivers with a license to kill in China, Asia Times12 April 2008, Bogus Military Vehicles And Plates Seized, Sky News According to Xinhua News Agency, \\"police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law\\",2008-04-11, Military Cracks Down on Fake License Plates, Xinhua which is the reason behind an emerging trend where individuals purchase counterfeit military registration plates to avoid being pulled over by police.

It is one of the most prestigious streets in Paris, and one of the most expensive addresses in the world, home to many grand palaces, including ones belonging to the Onassis and Rothschild families. The Rothschilds once owned numbers 19-21. The avenue runs from the Arc de Triomphe southwest to the Porte Dauphine at the edge of the Bois de Boulogne city park. It is the widest avenue in Paris and is lined with chestnut trees along its full length. History The Avenue was constructed during the reign of Emperor Napoleon III, as part of the grand plan for the reconstruction of Paris conducted by Napoleon's Prefect of the Seine, Baron Haussmann. It was designed to connect the Place d'Etoile with another important part of Haussmann's plan, the Bois de Boulogne, the new public park on the west end of the city. The original plan, by Jacques Hittorff, who had designed the Place de la Concorde decades earlier, called for an avenue forty meters wide between the modern Avenue Victor Hugo and the modern Avenue de la Grand Arm√©e. Haussmann scrapped this plan and instead called for an avenue at least one hundred meters wide, wider than the Champs-Elys√©es between the Arc de Triomphe and the new Bois de Boulogne. Its purpose was to provide an impressive grand approach for fashionable Parisians to promenade from the center of the city to the Park in their carriages, to see and be seen. It was to be called the Avenue de l'Imp√©ratrice, the Avenue of the Empress, for the Empress Eugenie, the wife of Napoleon III. The Avenue was built by Jean-Charles Adolphe Alphand, the chief engineer of the Service of Promenades and Plantations of Paris, who also designed the Bois de Boulogne, the Bois de Vincennes, Parc Monceau, the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, and other parks and squares built by Napoleon III. The iron fences and lamps were designed by the architect Gabriel Davioud, who designed all the distinctive ornamental park architecture of Paris during the period, from fountains and temples to gates and fences. The final design consisted of a central avenue one hundred twenty meters wide and 1300 meters long, flanked by sidewalks for pedestrians, riding paths for horsemen, and crisscrossing alleys, shaded by rows of chestnut trees and decorated along its full length by ornamental lawns and gardens with exotic flowers and plants. It was, in fact, an extension of the Bois de Boulogne, and connected directly with the avenues and paths of the park.Patrice de Moncan, Paris- Les jardins du Baron Haussmann. pp. 118-120. It opened in 1854, was immediately popular with Parisians, but it did not keep its name for long. After the downfall of Napoleon III in 1870, the name was changed from Avenue de l'Imp√©ratrice to Avenue du G√©n√©ral-Uhrich, and then in 1875 to Avenue du Bois de Boulogne. It was changed again in 1929 to Avenue Foch, after the hero of the First World War, who died in that year. During the Second World War, the street was nicknamed ¬´ avenue Boche ¬ª by the Parisians (\\"Boche\\" being a slang word for \\"German\\").Larry Collins, Fortitude, Robert Laffont, Paris, 1985, p. 84. The headquarters of the Gestapo was located for a time at number 72, and the office of Section IV B4 of the Gestapo, the Juden Referat, which was responsible for the arrest and deportation of French Jews to the concentration camps, had its office at 31 bis Avenue Foch. Guide to the Gestapo in Paris (in French) British agent Peter Churchill was tortured on the fifth floor of number 84. He survived the war. The Gardens The gardens of Avenue Foch occupy a space of 6.62 hectares, in the space 1200 meters long and 140 meters wide. In addition to the four thousand trees that line that avenue, the garden was originally planted with 2,400 different species of trees and plants, making it, as Alphand wrote, \\"a kind of arboretum.\\" Many of the original trees can still be found in the gardens, including a chestnut tree from India, 4.7 meters in circumference; from 1852, an elm tree from Siberia, 3.8 meters in circumference (1852); and a giant Catalpa tree 3.5 meters in circumference (1852).Jarrass√©, Dominique, Grammaire des jardins Parisiens, p. 159-161. The gardens contain a monument to Alphand, designed by architect Jules Formig√©, with sculpture by Jules Dalou. The monument was dedicated 14 December 1899.

His mother was Maren Falch (1629‚Äì1709https://www.geni.com/people/Maren-Pernille- Falch/6000000003645712977) whose father had been the local bailiff, a large land owner in Helgeland and manager for the D√∏nnes estate of Henrik Rantzau. His father died in 1653, when Petter was 6, and the children were cared for by relatives and friends. His mother remarried, but Petter remained with his mother's sister, Anna Falck, who was married to the priest at N√¶r√∏y. At 13, Petter began attending school in Bergen, and later studied theology at the University of Copenhagen. He was lonely during his years in Copenhagen, but intellectually stimulated. After his years in Copenhagen, he returned to Norway and became a tutor in Vefsn. He fathered a child out of wedlock, and had to travel to Copenhagen and seek pardon from the Danish king. In 1689, he was appointed parish priest at Alstahaug Church. His parish was quite large covering an area which included the villages of Hattfjelldal, Vevelstad, Leirfjord, Vefsn, Her√∏y, D√∏nna, Nesna, Hemnes and Rana.

The opening of the new museum building took place during Autumn 2007, 300 years after the death of Petter Dass. The facility inspires the teaching, research, artistic creative work, study and contemplation, and dialogue about culture and values. Since 1983, Petter Dass has also been honored with the traditional Petter Dass days at Alstahaug.Om Museet (Petter Dass Museum) Modern cultural influence Noted Norwegian Classical songwriter Edvard Grieg included the words of Petter Dass in his composition Fisherman's Song (Fiskervise. 1894) from 7 Barnlige Sange, Op.61. More recently Norwegian folk singer, Jack Berntsen has written songs based on poems by Petter Dass and Norwegian playwright Lars Berg wrote the play Petter Dass (1967). Mit navn er Petter Dass, a music album published in 2008 with lyrics by Petter Dass, was written by Kari Bremnes with her brothers Lars and Ola.

The show returned for a second series in 1998. 1998-1999 The duo moved to a more prime-time evening slot and the show was renamed Late Lunch.BFI - Films, TV and People In 1999, Mel and Sue were signed by ITV and hosted a comedy panel game for the network called Casting Couch, in a prime late evening slot, but it fared poorly in the ratings and was not recommissioned after its initial 6-episode run. ITV created Casting Couch as a vehicle to showcase Mel and Sue's comedic talents as a duo. In each episode, the pair form two teams under the guidance of team captains Chris Moyles and Tamara Beckwith, with regular guest celebrities Marcus Brigstocke and Kevin Day, and two guest celebrities. =2000s= Mel and Sue were announced as new co- presenters on Channel 4's RI:SE breakfast TV show in January 2003. The pair appeared together again with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders in a French & Saunders Mamma Mia comedy sketch for Comic Relief in 2009. The double-act was less active in this period, while Mel had children.The Mirror - Sue Perkins thought Mel having a baby could 'destroy' friendship after brain tumour left her unable to have kids =2010s= Perkins confirmed on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross that the duo would be working together on something new in 2010. Their new show, a baking competition series, The Great British Bake Off, ran for six years on the BBC. It began on BBC Two in August 2010, and after four series it was moved to BBC One for its fifth series in 2014 and a sixth in 2015. On Richard Herring's Leicester Square Theatre Podcast in 2015, Perkins said she had been reluctant to work on Bake Off, but agreed on the condition that the BBC offered Mel the chance to share the presenting role.British Comedy Guide - Podcasts In January 2015, Mel and Sue launched a new ITV daytime chat show called Mel and Sue, the show features appearances from celebrity guests, audience interaction and cookery, this time with members of the public being nominated to appear as the guest chef. In September 2016, when it was announced that The Great British Bake Off would be moving to Channel 4 in 2017, Mel and Sue said that they would not be a part of the channel move and be stepping down as hosts of the show after the 7th edition. In October 2016, it was confirmed that Mel and Sue would become the presenters of Let's Sing and Dance for Comic Relief for BBC One in March 2017. On 23 July 2017, it was confirmed that Mel and Sue would host a new version of The Generation Game for BBC One. In 2020 Mel and Sue costarred as contract killers in Sky comedy Hitmen. Radio Mel and Sue's paired radio credits began with appearances by Mel on Sue's BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show series The 99p Challenge in 2000BBC Comedy, then in 2002 they made a show for BBC Radio 2 titled Mel And Sue's Comedy Breakdown, a six-part series exploring the best of comedy, and BBC Radio 4's, The Mel and Sue Thing, a six-part series that also aired in 2002 and was later released on BBC CD. Live shows Their first show at Edinburgh Fringe was in 1993 and it was called Naked Brunch according to the Telegraph and Naked Lunch according to the Independent.The Telegraph - HomeThe Independent In 1994 Mel and Sue performed a show at Edinburgh called Kittens Go Grrrrr and in 1996 their show was called Planet Pussycat.The Independent - CultureThe Telegraph - Innocent Charms and Demonic Dummies Their style was noted by The Independent as character comedy. As well as performing live as a duo in their early stand-up days, Mel and Sue embarked on a UK national tour from 1995 - 1996. When they appeared on Room 101 together, one of their choices was one of their dates from this tour - in Leighton Buzzard. They chose this because of the fact that they had a such a bad audience there. Once their television career was in full swing, in April and May 1999 they toured the country again with their show, Mel & Sue: Back to Our Routes which was \\"a hilarious stage show that captures the submersive brilliance of their smash-hit TV show\\" according to the show's promotional material. One reviewer remarked: \\"Mel and Sue on stage is virtually the same as the TV incarnation, except they don't have any guests.\\" References External links *Official Mel & Sue Website - Official website has not been updated since 1999.

Murders Succo was born in Mestre. On 3 April 1981 he fatally stabbed his mother Maria 32 times, and his father, a police officer, who had refused to lend him their car. He hid their bodies in the bathtub covered in water and lime to delay the discovery of the murders and fled with his father's service pistol. He then fled from Mestre, but an investigation into the murders of the Succo couple immediately connected them to the son, who was arrested two days later at the exit of a pizzeria in San Pietro al Natisone, not far from the border with Yugoslavia, after he had briefly returned to the crime scene. After Succo was caught, he was judged mentally ill and sentenced to ten years in a psychiatric prison in Reggio Emilia. While serving his sentence, he was a model prisoner who studied geology at the University of Parma. After serving five years of his sentence, on May 15, 1986 while on freedom privileges, Succo escaped from the psychiatric hospital. He evaded police and escaped to France by rail, using fake documents and changing his surname to \\"Kurt\\". In the next few years, he committed numerous crimes, including burglary, rape and murder. In France, he killed two women, a physician, and two police officers.The Italian is sought fter N.1 in France, La Repubblica, February 12, 1988 He kidnapped, hijacked, and terrorized people in three European countries. He was considered Public Enemy number one by France, Italy, and Switzerland. After being recognized by a student in Aix-les-Bains on April 6, Succo returned to Italy. On 28 February 1988 he was caught in Mestre, his hometown.

Basically, a patent application can relate only to one invention or a group of closely related inventions. The purpose of this requirement is administrative, as well as financial. That is, the requirement serves to preclude the option of filing one patent application for several inventions, while paying only one set of fees (filing fee, search fee, examination fee, renewal fees, and so on). Unity of invention also makes the classification of patent documents easier. When a patent application is objected to on the ground of a lack of unity, it may be still considered for patent protection, unlike in the case where the invention is found to be lacking novelty. A divisional application can usually be filed for the second invention, and for the further inventions, if any. Alternatively, a patent prosecutor may make a technical argument that there is unity of invention.  Jurisdictions  = European Patent Convention = Under European patent practice and case law, lack of unity (of invention) can appear either \\"a priori\\", before the prior art was examined, or \\"a posteriori\\", after the prior art was examined. An a posteriori lack of unity usually results from a lack of novelty or inventive step of the subject- matter of one independent claim. = Patent Cooperation Treaty = Under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), an international application, which is also called PCT application, \\"shall relate to one invention only or to a group of inventions so linked as to form a single general inventive concept\\". If the requirement of unity of invention is not met, the International Searching Authority (i.e., the patent office in charge of carrying out the international search) \\"is entitled to request the applicant to pay an additional search fee for each invention beyond the first which is to be searched\\". Practical Advice, The consequences of a finding by the ISA of lack of unity of invention, PCT Newsletter, August 2008, p. 6. , In reaction to such a request from the International Searching Authority (ISA), the applicant may pay all or some of the requested additional search fees, and the International Searching Authority (ISA) then establishes the international search for all or some of the inventions or groups of inventions, respectively. The applicant may also decide not to pay any of the additional search fees, and, in such case, the ISA does not carry out a search for the inventions or groups of inventions for which no search fees have been paid. The international search report (ISR) is then established only for the first claimed invention. If the applicant disagrees with the ISA‚Äôs finding of lack of unity of invention, the additional fees may be paid under protest. In the protest procedure, the applicant files a reasoned statement explaining why it considers that the requirement of unity of invention has been complied with, or that the number of additional fees required is excessive. After payment of the additional search fees and, if required, of a protest fee, the protest is examined by a review body. If the review body finds the protest justified, it orders the total or partial reimbursement of the additional search fees, and, if applicable, the protest fee, to the applicant. When, for instance, the European Patent Office acts as ISA, the review body in charge of examining the protest consists of three members: \\"the head of a directorate, normally the head of the directorate by which the invitation to pay additional fees was issued, an examiner with special expertise in unity of invention and, normally, the examiner who issued the invitation.\\" Decision of the President of the European Patent Office dated 24 June 2007 providing for review panels for the implementation of the protest procedure under the PCT, Special edition No. 3 OJ EPO, p. 140. This decision is also referred to as: \\"Decision concerning the PCT protest procedure\\". = United States = In U.S. patent law, applications that claim more than one distinct invention may be subject to restriction to a single invention, and the applicant may prosecute the remaining invention(s) by filing a divisional application(s). A \\"restriction requirement\\" will typically present the different inventions based on the claims within the application, and the applicant may elect which invention he would prosecute.

It is located north of Lijiang City, Yunnan in southwestern China. It is part of the Three Parallel Rivers of Yunnan Protected Areas World Heritage Site. Legend says the name comes from a hunted tiger escaping by jumping across the river at the narrowest point (still wide), using the rock in the middle. At a maximum depth of approximately 3,790 meters (12,434 feet) from river to mountain peak, Tiger Leaping Gorge is one of the deepest and most spectacular river canyons in the world. The inhabitants of the gorge are primarily the indigenous Naxi people, who live in a handful of small hamlets. Their primary subsistence comes from grain production and hikers. Geography Around in length, the gorge is located where the river passes between the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain and the Haba Snow Mountain in a series of rapids under steep cliffs. Administratively, the river in this area forms the border between Yulong Naxi Autonomous County of Lijiang City (right bank) and Shangri-La County of Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (left bank). The gorge is not considered navigable. In the early 1980s, four rafters attempted to go down the gorge and were never seen again. In 1986, the first known successful attempt to sail through the gorge was made by the first expedition to float down the entire length of the Yangtze, starting at the river's high source at the Gelandandong glacier lake. The area was officially opened to foreign tourists in 1993,Frank Langfitt, \\"China tourism: mixed blessing\\", Baltimore Sun, July 2, 2000. but had attracted adventurous backpackers already in the 1980s. Officials plan to improve the existing trails and roads, bringing tour buses and more development. These plans arouse highly varied reactions among the local population, from strong opposition to strong support. Natural crystals are mined from areas in and surrounding the Tiger Leaping Gorge. Climate Tiger Leaping Gorge weather is generally mild, with abundant rainfall and plenty of sunshine. It has an average annual temperature between 13¬∞C (55 F) and 20¬∞C (68 F), without too much change from spring to winter. In summer, the temperature just falls between 10 - 26¬∞C (50 - 79 F) low because of the continuous rain. Coming to winter, the high mountains block the cold air from northern China, so it is still as warm as spring for most of the days. Spring: March and April are best months to hike in Tiger Leaping Gorge for comfortable weather with temperatures up to 20¬∞C. Take a light jacket. May is even more warmer than April and there are more blooming flora. Summer: It's the rainy season of Tiger Leaping Gorge from June to September. The heavy rain may result in the gorge being closed on certain days. Autumn: The scenery from mid-autumn to November is also excellent. Usually dry and sunny, bring a long- sleeve, light sweater and a coat. Winter: A good time to hike the gorge for the sunny weather, dry and clear. It's cold at night and chilly at morning. Best time to visit Tiger Leaping Gorge hike can be undertaken at any time around the year as it enjoys a mild climate even in winter (5-15 degrees Celsius), but the temperature difference of a day is great. Most of the days are sunny and dry; however, it rains a lot during the rainy season from July to September and there is some risk that paths could be blocked due to landslides. Check the Tiger Leaping Gorge Weather Forecast before you visit. Roads and trails Hiking the length of the gorge is possible. The hiking path (\\"the high road\\") is well-maintained and marked, although sometimes narrow, and at times impassable due to heavy rains, and is used by the Naxi as part of everyday life. This trail is longer than the lower road, approximately , but is more varied. It features a variety of micro-ecosystems, waterfalls, and a fair number of guesthouses for trekkers. These guesthouses are not well heated, which combined with the unpredictable nature of high mountain weather makes this trek unadvisable during the rainy season. The lower road, stretching about from Qiaotou through the Gorge, is a stretch of pavement (until recently a simple mule track) crossed by several waterfalls, and frequently beset by rockslides. Some portions of the road have been known to disappear into the river below. The road follows the Yangtze, so there are more views of the river, and a stronger sense of being in a gorge than on the upper trail. Where the high road descends to meet the lower road, one can climb down to the river near the Tiger Leaping Stone, the point at which the tiger is said to have leaped.Tiger Leaping Gorge: Day 3. Tiger Leaping Stone, the Middle Rapids, and the Sky Ladder. In July 2010, the Chinese government closed the gorge to visitors because a new lower road was being built. Consequently, there were no government officials to charge the 50 yuan fee to enter the trail. Locals requested a 10 yuan fee to enter the trail. Many trekkers still hiked the high road in spite of its closure. Some buses continued to travel the low road, although landslides frequently caused travel delays.Tiger Leaping Gorge: Day 1.

The project was abandoned in December 2007. This project was also related to the Three Gorges Dam and the South- North Water Transfer Project, which would cause massive environmental damage and the destruction of thousands of cultural sites.

While having a history of civil vessel construction, Kockums' most renowned activity is the fabrication of military corvettes and submarines. Kockums worked with Northrop Grumman and Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW) to offer a Visby-class corvette derivative in the American Focused Mission Vessel Study, a precursor to the Littoral Combat Ship program. It competed with several other concepts, including Norway's Skjold class (part of a Raytheon led group). History The G√§ngtappen (sv; formerly Kockumshuset) building in Malm√∂, used as Kockums' HQ from 1958‚Äì2015. Since 2019 owned by L√§nsf√∂rs√§kringar. =The submarine conflict= As a result of the Swedish shipyard crisis (sv) which heavily affected the industry during 1969‚Äì1985, due to heavy competition from the Far East and the 1973 oil crisis, Kockums was placed under the control of the Swedish state through the state-owned company Svenska Varv and its successor company Celsius AB (sv) from 1979 until 1999. Having implemented a highly advanced variety of the Stirling engine for low noise submarine propulsion, Kockums was considered to have strategic value for the Swedish Navy. During the period of state ownership, Kockums acquired Karlskronavarvet (sv), the operator of the Karlskrona shipyards, in 1989. In 1999, following the acquisition of Celsius AB by Saab, Kockums was sold to the German shipbuilding company HDW. In 2005, HDW was bought by the German industrial conglomerate Thyssen Krupp. The time after 1999 was rife with conflicts between Kockums' only Swedish customer, the Defence Materiel Administration (FMV), and Kockums' German owners. The Swedish view was that the technical advancements made in collaboration between Kockums and FMV ought to be used to create a new generation of submarine for lucrative export: the A26 submarine. On the German side, the A26 project was said to be regarded as a high-risk project that could lead to uncontrollably growing costs. Superficially, the major source of conflict seemed to be that neither ThyssenKrupp nor FMV would accept carrying unforeseen development costs. As several technical innovations to be implemented in the A26 were kept in classified status at the FMV, ThyssenKrupp argued that the implied costs were too difficult to predict. This deadlock persisted for months until the FMV decided to cancel the order of the A26 submarines. Globally, the conflict also concerned the general business strategy. ThyssenKrupp insisted that Kockums ought to discontinue large submarine construction and to focus on the development of small submarines. Meanwhile, anonymous sources from inside Kockums claimed that ThyssenKrupp's goal in acquiring Kockums was never to reach synergies with HDW, but only to eliminate its main competitor. When the Crimea crisis erupted in March 2014, Sweden's defence interests in the future of Kockums came under closer scrutiny. The turning point was described by the chairman of the Swedish parliament's Standing Committee on Defense (SCD), Peter Hultquist: In the search for a partner to develop the next generation of submarines, the FMV approached the SAAB Group. During autumn 2013, Saab tried to reach an agreement to buy Kockums from ThyssenKrupp. ThyssenKrupp demanded to keep its monopoly position in the A26 deal, which Saab refused to accept, causing the negotiations to fail. Saab responded by approaching Kockums' engineers, offering them employment at Saab Naval Systems. Thyssen Krupp tried in vain to keep its engineers at Kockums, proposing an extra month's salary. The hostility towards ThyssenKrupp reached a new level during the Kockums equipment repossession incident on 8 April 2014. As per protocol, two military trucks accompanied by armed soldiers entered the Kockums shipyard in Malm√∂ to reclaim all materiel and equipment belonging to the Defence Materiel Administration (Sweden), FMV, as well as all secret blueprints and images. By orders from a manager, Kockums staff tried to sabotage the repossession by locking the gates with the repossession crew and escort still inside. According to a spokesperson from FMV this is the first time they have had to forcefully repossess equipment. Shortly after, ThyssenKrupp initiated discussions to sell Kockums to Saab. The deal was finalized on 22 July 2014, making Saab the new owner of Kockums.  Exports  Australia: In November 2014 Saab formally made a bid in SEA 1000, the Royal Australian Navy's replacement program for the six Collins-class submarines still in service. Defence Minister David Johnston stated that \\"We need to decide quickly and whatever we do decide will be in the best interests of the entire nation\\". The Australian Government had been ready to buy the more expensive S≈çry≈´-class submarine offered by the Japanese Maritime Self Defence Force; however, internal opposition had forced the government to have an open tender for the multi-billion-dollar program. Australia subsequently selected Naval Group (formerly DCNS) France and their Shortfin Barracuda submarines to replace the Australian Collins class. In December 2014 it was announced that leading global Dutch shipbuilder Damen Shipyards entered into an agreement with Saab to develop, offer, and build next-generation submarines, initially focusing on the planned replacement of 4 Walrus Class submarines currently used by The Royal Netherlands Navy. The Kockums Crane The crane in February 2000. The shipyard formerly possessed a 138-metre high crane, known as the Kockums Crane, built in 1973/74 and capable of lifting 1500 tons, making it the largest crane in the world when it was installed in 1974. The crane was not used much because of the Swedish shipyard crisis of the late 1970s and 1980s. It was used the last time in 1997 for lifting the foundations of the high pillars of the Oresund Bridge. The crane was sold the first time in the early 1990s to the Danish company Burmeister & Wain, but the company went bankrupt shortly thereafter. It was later sold to a Korean company, Hyundai Heavy Industries. The crane was a landmark of Malm√∂ from its time of construction until its dismantling before being shipped to Ulsan in South Korea in the summer of 2002.

He was born in Rakvere, Estonia. Vaska was educated at the Baltic University in Hamburg, Germany (1946) and subsequently at the University of G√∂ttingen (1946‚Äì1949), where he received his Vordiplom (equivalent to the American B.S. degree). He pursued his Ph.D. in inorganic chemistry at the University of Texas in the United States (1952‚Äì1956). He was a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University (1956‚Äì1957) where he conducted research on magnetochemistry. In 1957 he took a position as Fellow at the Mellon Institute in Pittsburgh, where he remained until 1964. During that time, the Mellon Institute housed a number of future chemical luminaries, including Paul Lauterbur and R. Bruce King. Vaska moved as an associate professor to Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York, where, from 1990 to his death, he was professor emeritus of chemistry. His brother Vootele Vaska is a philosopher. He died in Basking Ridge, New Jersey in 2015, aged 90.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/dailyrecord/obituary.aspx?n=lauri- vaska&pid;=176541866&fhid;=17074 \\"Vaska's complex.\\" Research Vaska published ca. eighty journal articles on the coordination chemistry of transition metals, homogeneous catalysis, and both organometallic and bioinorganic chemistry. His years at Mellon were especially productive. With J.W. Di Luzio in 1962 he first described the iridium compound which became known as Vaska's complex, trans-IrCl(CO)[P(C6H5)3]2 Working with a series of coworkers, he demonstrated that this iridium(I) complex undergoes a variety of reactions with small molecules. For example, it oxidatively adds H2 to give a dihydride. He subsequently discovered that his complex reversibly bound O2, which was then a startling achievement. He discovered the main reactions of oxidative addition, a process that is central to homogeneous catalysis in organometallic chemistry. He demonstrated a number of important substituent effects on the oxidative addition, such as the greater reactivity of Ir(I) vs. Rh(I) and the stabilization of oxidative adducts by iodide vs. chloride. Recognition Among his awards are the Boris Pregel Award for Research in Chemical Physics (New York Academy of Sciences) in 1971 and election in 1981 as a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science for \\"pioneering work in transition metal organometallic chemistry and synthetic oxygen carriers\\".

The advances in technology allow the Sanger Institute to carry out sequencing of the genomes of individual humans, vertebrate species and pathogens, at an ever-increasing pace and reducing cost. The Institute has more than 100 ongoing pathogen sequencing projects. The output of the Sanger Institute is around 10 billion bases of raw sequence data per day. =Scientific resources= Bioinformatic databases resources are one of the outcomes of research programmes that the Sanger Institute is involved in. Those hosted by the Sanger Institute include: * COSMIC, a catalogue of somatic mutations in cancer * DECIPHER, a database of chromosomal imbalance and phenotype in humans, using Ensembl resources * Ensembl, a genome browser co- hosted by the European Bioinformatics Institute. * GeneDB, a pathogen sequence database * Mouse Genetics Project, including a database of standardised phenotypic analysis for many hundreds of mutant mice. * Vega, a vertebrate genome annotation resource Several databases were initiated at the Sanger Institute but are now hosted elsewhere: * MEROPS, a peptidase database * Pfam, a protein family database * Rfam, an RNA family database * TreeFam, a database of phylogenetic trees for animal genes * WormBase, a database on the biology and sequence of the model organism C. elegans and other related Nematodes. * WormBase ParaSite, a database for the genomics for parasitic helminths (both Nematodes and Platyhelminthes). Research The Morgan Building (right), part of the Sanger Institute Scientific research at the Sanger Institute is organised into five Scientific Programmes, each defining a major area of research with a particular biological, disease or analytic focus. The current Programmes at the Sanger Institute are Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation, Cellular Genetics, Human Genetics, Parasites and Microbes and Tree of Life. Studies from all programmes provide insights into human, pathogen, cellular evolution, the phenotypic and hence biological consequences of genome variation and the processes which cause mutations. =Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme= Provides leadership in data aggregation and informatics innovation, develops high-throughput cellular models of cancer for genome-wide functional screens and drug testing, and explores somatic mutation's role in clonal evolution, ageing and development. This Programme includes the Cancer Genome Project. =Cellular Genetics Programme= Explores human gene function by studying the impact of genome variation on cell biology. Large-scale systematic screens are used to discover the impact of naturally occurring and engineered genome mutations in human induced pluripotent cells (hIPSCs), their differentiated derivatives and other cell types. It is one of the founder programmes driving the creation and organisation of the international Human Cell Atlas initiative. =Human Genetics Programme= The Institute's research in human genetics focuses on the characterisation of human genetic variation in health and disease. Aside from the Institute's contribution to the Human Genome Project, researchers at the Sanger Institute have made contributions in various research areas relating to disease, population comparative and evolutionary genetics. In January 2008, the launch of the 1000 Genomes Project, a collaboration with scientists around the globe, signalled an effort to sequence the genomes of 1000 individuals in order to create the \\"most detailed map of human genetic variation to support disease studies\\". The data from the pilot projects was made freely available in public databases in June 2010. In 2010, the Sanger Institute announced its participation in the UK10K project, which will sequence the genomes of 10,000 individuals to identify rare genetic variants and their effects on human health. The Sanger Institute is also part of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, an international effort to describe different cancer tumour types. It is also part of the GENCODE and ENCODE research programmes to create an encyclopaedia of DNA elements. The Programme applies genomics to population-scale studies to identify the causal variants and pathways involved in human disease and their effects on cell biology. It also models developmental disorders to explore which physical aspects might be reversible. =Pathogens and Microbes Programme= Investigates the common underpinning mechanisms of evolution, infection and resistance to therapy into bolster understanding of bacteria, viruses and parasites, with a particular interest in malaria. It also explores the effects of genome variation on the biology of host-pathogen interactions, in particular host response to infection and the role of microiotia in health and disease. All the genomes after sequencing are made available at the web-based onsite-maintained database, GeneDB. = Tree of Life Programme = The Tree of Life Programme was created in 2019 to investigate the diversity of complex organisms found in the UK through sequencing and cellular technologies. It also compares and contrasts species' genome sequences to unlock insights into evolution and conservation. This Programme will play a leading role in the Darwin Tree of Life Project, a UK-wide initiative to sequence the genomes of all 66,000 complex species (eukaryotes) in the British Isles. =Collaborations= Much of the Sanger Institute's research is carried out in partnership with the wider scientific community; over 90 percent of the Institute's research papers involve collaborations with other organisations.Figure based on data for 2008 retrieved from SCOPUS website Significant collaborations include: * 1000 Genomes Project * GENCODE and ENCODE (ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) * International Cancer Genome Consortium * International HapMap Project * International Knockout Mouse Consortium * International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium * SNP (Single nucleotide polymorphism) Consortium * The Copy Number Variation Project * The genome sequencing of S. pombe, C. elegans, mouse and the Malaria parasite. * The Human Genome Project * The UK 10,000 Genomes Project (UK10K)UK10K (the UK 10,000 Genomes Project) * Wellcome Trust - Department of Biotechnology, India Alliancehttp://www.wellcomedbt.org/Mini_symposium_final_poster_schedule.pdf =Public engagement= Children at a public outreach event thread bracelets in four colours to spell out a DNA sequence. The Sanger Institute has a programme of public engagement activity. The programme aims to make complex biomedical research accessible to a range of audiences including school students and their teachers, and local community members. The Communication and Public Engagement programme aims to \\"encourage informed discussion about issues relevant to Sanger Institute research\\" and \\"foster a community of researchers who can engage effectively with different audiences\\". The Institute hosts visits for more than 1,500 students, teachers and community groups per year. Visitors may meet scientific staff, tour the Institute and its facilities, and participate in ethical debates and activities. The programme also offers professional development sessions for teachers of GCSE and post 16 science through the national network of Science Learning Centres, and by hosting visits for groups interested in updating their knowledge in contemporary genetics. Videoconferencing into the Sanger Institute is also offered for Science Learning Centres, Science Centres and schools. Scientific and public engagement staff also collaborate on and contribute to national projects such as the UK's InsideDNA traveling exhibition and the Who am I? gallery at The Science Museum. They also participate in public events such as the Cambridge Science Festival. =Graduate training= The Institute operates two PhD training programmes: a four-year course for basic science graduates, and a three-year course for clinicians. The four-year course requires students to rotate around three different laboratories in order to broaden their scientific horizons before choosing a PhD project. Each student is required to choose at least one experimental and one informatics-based rotation project. Institute houses approximately 50 pre-doctoral students, all of whom are registered at the University of Cambridge. Officers According to Companies House the five officers of the parent company Genome Research Limited are Henry Parkinson, Kay Elizabeth Davies, Rolf Dieter Heuer, James Cuthbert Smith, David Lindsay Willetts. According to the Sanger website Henry Parkinson is head of legal. Staff the Sanger employs around 900 people, and is led by Michael Stratton. Notable scientific staff, faculty and alumni are listed below: =Academic faculty= a faculty of 32 scientists lead hypothesis- driven research, seeking answers to biomedical questions. Among others, these include Dominic Kwiatkowski, Nicole Soranzo, Michael Stratton, Sarah Teichmann and Matthew Hurles. The institute also has a number of Associate Faculty members, International Fellows and Honorary Faculty. These include Adrian Bird, Ewan Birney, Chris Ponting, Fiona Powrie, Stephen O'Rahilly and Wolf Reik, among others. =Scientific advisory board= The Sanger Board of Management are guided by the scientific advisory board whose members include Professor David Altshuler, Professor Anton Berns, Professor David J. Lipman, Professor Kevin Marsh and Professor Sir Paul Nurse. =Alumni= Previous faculty members at the Sanger include: *Alex Bateman, EMBL-EBI * Tim Hubbard, Professor at King's College London * Leena Peltonen-Palotie (1952 ‚Äì 2010) * Julian Rayner * Eleftheria Zeggini * Richard Durbin FRS History The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute was established in 1992, funded by the Wellcome Trust and the UK's Medical Research Council =Management = John E. Sulston was the founding Director of the Sanger Institute. Sulston was instrumental in the choice of the Hinxton site for the Institute and remained there as Director until the announcement of the completion of the draft human genome in 2000. Sulston graduated from the University of Cambridge in 1963 and completed his PhD on the chemical synthesis of DNA in 1966. He shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Robert Horvitz and Sydney Brenner, two years after standing down as Director of the Institute. In 2000, Allan Bradley left his appointment as Professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, in the US, to take up the position as Director of the Sanger Institute. Bradley wanted to build on the achievements made by the Sanger Institute in the Human Genome Project by \\"concentrating on gene function, cancer genomics, and the genomes of model organisms such as the mouse and the zebrafish\\". Bradley received his BA, MA and PhD in Genetics from the University of Cambridge. In 2010, Bradley stepped down from his leadership role to form a startup company, but remains on the faculty of the Institute as Director Emeritus. Mike Stratton, who is a leader of the Cancer Genome Project and the International Cancer Genome Consortium, was appointed Director of the Sanger Institute in May of that year. =Human Genome Project= The Sanger Institute was opened in 1993, three years after the inception of the Human Genome Project, and went on to make the largest single contribution to the gold standard sequence of the human genome, published in 2004. The Institute was engaged in collaborations to sequence 8 of the 23 human pairs of chromosomes (1, 6, 9, 10, 13, 20, 22, and X). Since the publishing of the human genome, research carried out at the Institute has developed beyond sequencing of organisms into various biomedical research areas, including studies into diseases such as cancer, malaria and diabetes. Controversy In August 2018 it was reported that an investigation was under way into allegations of bullying of staff and gender discrimination made against senior management of the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, including the director. The investigation, carried out by the barrister Thomas Kibling from Matrix Chambers, concluded in October 2018 and cleared Stratton of any wrongdoing, while listing areas for improvement in the workings of the Sanger Institute. The findings and the independence of the investigation were disputed. In October 2019 it was reported that the institute had manufactured a medical tool with the intent of monetising it despite not having ethical nor legal approval to do so and having been made aware by Stellenbosch University and internal whistleblowers.

Measuring 4 Œºm wide to 8 Œºm high, an enamel rod is a tightly packed, highly organized mass of hydroxyapatite crystals, which are hexagonal in shape and provide rigidity to the rods and strengthen the enamel. In cross section, it is best compared to a keyhole with the top, or head, oriented toward the crown of the tooth and the bottom, or tail, oriented toward the root of the tooth. They range from 5 million to 12 million in number. (5 million in mandibular lateral incisor and 12 million in maxillary first molars). Enamel rods are found in rows along the tooth. Within each row, the long axis of the enamel rod generally is perpendicular to the underlying enamel-dentine junction. In permanent teeth, the enamel rods near the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) tilt slightly more toward the root of the tooth than would be expected. Knowing the orientation of enamel is very important in restorative dentistry because enamel unsupported by underlying dentin is prone to fracture and usually is avoided. The arrangement of crystals within each enamel rod is highly complex. For the most part, the enamel crystals are oriented parallel to the long axis of the rod. The further away the crystals are from the central axis, the more their own orientation diverges. The area around the enamel rod is known as interrod enamel. Interrod enamel has the same composition as the enamel rods. Nonetheless, a histologic distinction is made between the two because crystal orientation is different in each. The crystals lie nearly perpendicular to the enamel rod.

Not all pitches are the same size, though the preferred size for many professional teams' stadiums is with an area of . A football pitch (also known as a football field) For example, is the playing surface for the game of association football. Its dimensions and markings are defined by Law 1 of the Laws of the Game, \\"The Field of Play\\". The pitch is typically made of natural turf or artificial turf, although amateur and recreational teams often play on dirt fields. Artificial surfaces must be green in colour. All line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on or above the touchline is still on the field of play, and a foul committed over the line bounding the penalty area results in a penalty. Therefore, a ball must completely cross the touchline to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line (between the goal posts) before a goal is scored; if any part of the ball is still on or above the line, the ball is still in play. The field descriptions that apply to adult matches are described below. Because of the role of the British football associations in the history of the game, the dimensions of the field of play were originally formulated and expressed in imperial units. Since 1997, the Laws of the Game have preferred metric units, with imperial equivalents given only in brackets. Because the actual values have, in general, not changed since the early twentieth century, they tend to be round numbers in imperial units (for example the width of the goal, unchanged since 1863, is 8 yards or 7.32 metres). Use of the imperial values remains common, especially in the United Kingdom. Pitch boundary The goal line at the Stretford End of Old Trafford in Manchester (1992) The pitch is rectangular in shape. The longer sides are called touchlines. The other opposing sides are called the goal lines. The two goal lines must be between wide, and be the same length. The two touchlines must be between long, and be the same length. All lines on the ground must be equally wide, not to exceed . The corners of the pitch are marked by corner flags. For international matches the field dimensions are more tightly constrained; the goal lines must be between 64 and 75m wide (70 and 82yds), and the touchlines must be between long. Although the term goal line is often taken to mean only that part of the line between the goalposts, in fact it refers to the complete line at either end of the pitch, from one corner flag to the other. In contrast, the term byline (or by-line) is often used to refer to that portion of the goal line outside the goalposts. This term is commonly used in football commentaries and match descriptions, such as this example from a BBC match report: \\"Udeze gets to the left byline and his looping cross is cleared...\\"Match report BBC  Goals  A football goal Goals are placed at the centre of each goal-line. These consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the corner flagposts, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be above the ground. ie the area that players have to shoot at is 17.86 sq. metres (192 sq. feet) . Nets are usually placed behind the goal, though are not required by the Laws. Goalposts and crossbars must be white, and made of wood, metal or other approved material. Rules regarding the shape of goalposts and crossbars are somewhat more lenient, but they must conform to a shape that does not pose a threat to players. Since the beginning of football there have always been goalposts, but the crossbar was not invented until 1875, before which a string between the goalposts was used. A goal is scored when the ball crosses the goal line between the goal-posts, even if a defending player last touched the ball before it crossed the goal line (see own goal). A goal may, however, be ruled illegal (and void by the referee) if the player who scored or a member of their team commits an offence under any of the laws between the time the ball was previously out of play and the goal being scored. It is also deemed void if a player on the opposing team commits an offence before the ball has passed the line, as in the case of fouls being committed, a penalty awarded but the ball continued on a path that caused it to cross the goal line. The football goal size for a junior match goal is approximately half the size of an adult sized match goal. =History of football goals and nets= Football goals were first described in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to \\"goals\\" in Cornish hurling. Carew described how goals were made: \\"they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales\\". The first reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659). Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to \\"when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe\\". Solid crossbars were first introduced by the Sheffield Rules. Football nets were invented by Liverpool engineer John Brodie in 1891, and they were a necessary help for discussions about whether or not a goal had been scored. Penalty and goal areas The penalty area is the large marked rectangular area. The smaller rectangle within it is the goal area (here, the yellow-shirted goalkeeper is the only player in the goal area). The penalty arc is the curved line adjoining the \\"top\\" of the penalty area (here, the red-shirted referee is standing near the arc). Two rectangular boxes are marked out on the pitch in front of each goal. The goal area (colloquially the \\"six-yard box\\"), consists of the rectangle formed by the goal-line, two lines starting on the goal-line from the goalposts and extending into the pitch from the goal-line, and the line joining these, ie they are a rectangle 6yds by 20yds. Goal kicks and any free kick by the defending team may be taken from anywhere in this area. Indirect free kicks awarded to the attacking team within the goal area are taken from the point on the line parallel to the goal line (the \\"six-yard line\\") nearest where the infringement occurred; they cannot be taken any closer to the goal line. Similarly drop-balls that would otherwise occur closer to the goal line are taken on this line. The penalty area (colloquially \\"the 18-yard box\\" or just \\"the box\\") is similarly formed by the goal-line and lines extending from it, but its lines start from the goalposts and extend into the field. ie this is a rectangle 44yds by 18 yds. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to denote where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a foul by a defender, usually punished by a direct free kick, becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Both the goal and penalty areas were formed as semicircles until 1902. The penalty mark (colloquially \\"the penalty spot\\" or just \\"the spot\\") is in front of the very centre of the goal: this is the point from where penalty kicks are taken. The penalty arc (colloquially \\"the D\\") is marked from the outside edge of the penalty area, from the penalty mark; this, along with the penalty area, marks an exclusion zone for all players other than the penalty kicker and defending goalkeeper during a penalty kick. Other markings The centre circle is marked at from the centre mark. Similar to the penalty arc, this indicates the minimum distance that opposing players must keep at kick-off; the ball itself is placed on the centre mark. During penalty shootouts all players other than the two goalkeepers and the current kicker are required to remain within this circle. The half-way line divides the pitch in two. The half which a team defends is commonly referred to as being their half. Players must be within their own half at a kick-off and may not be penalised as being offside in their own half. The intersections between the half-way line and the touchline can be indicated with flags like those marking the corners ‚Äì the laws consider this as an optional feature. The arcs in the corners denote the area (within 1 yard of the corner) in which the ball has to be placed for corner kicks; opposition players have to be away during a corner, and there may be optional lines off-pitch 9.15 metres (10 yards) away from the corner arc on the goal- and touch-lines to help gauge these distances. Turf Grass is the normal surface of play, although artificial turf may sometimes be used especially in locations where maintenance of grass may be difficult due to inclement weather. This may include areas where it is very wet, causing the grass to deteriorate rapidly; where it is very dry, causing the grass to die; and where the turf is under heavy use. Artificial turf pitches are also increasingly common on the Scandinavian Peninsula, due to the amount of snow during the winter months. The strain put on grass pitches by the cold climate and subsequent snow clearing has necessitated the installation of artificial turf in the stadia of many top-tier clubs in Norway, Sweden and Finland. The latest artificial surfaces use rubber crumbs, as opposed to the previous system of sand infill. Some leagues and football associations have specifically prohibited artificial surfaces due to injury concerns and require teams' home stadia to have grass pitches. All artificial turf must be green and also meet the requirements specified in the FIFA Quality Concept for Football Turf. Football can also be played on a dirt field. In most parts of the world, dirt is only used for casual recreational play.

They represent the incremental pattern of enamel, the successive apposition of different layers of enamel during crown formation. Appearance The terminations of Striae of Retzius in a canine, called perikymata. (Visible in the picture's high resolution) When viewed microscopically in cross-section, they appear as concentric rings. In a longitudinal section, they appear as a series of dark bands. The presence of the dark lines is similar to the annual rings on a tree. They are named after Swedish anatomist Anders Retzius. In the longitudinal section of a tooth. these lines appear near the dentin. They bend obliquely near the cervical region. They curve occlusally near the cuspal regions or the incisal regions. Produced during the second stage of enamel calcification, also known as the maturation stage, ameloblasts produce matrix and enamel at the rate of 4 micrometers per day; however every fourth day there is a change in development. Brownish lines, the striae of Retzius, develop as a result of a change in the growth process. Macroscopically, these lines can be seen on the labial surface or lip side of anterior or front teeth as horizontal lines on the tooth crown, also known as perikymata or \\"imbrication lines\\" . Evenly spaced Retzius lines indicate a 6- to 11-day cycle of enamel formation. Causes Occasional darker striae or grooves of Retzius result from systemic disturbances in the human body. For example, a fever can cause some lines to appear darker than those surrounding them. Normally, amelogenesis involves a period of enamel matrix formation and a rest period. In case of any disturbance, the rest periods are prolonged and occur close to one another. Consequently, the line of Retzius appears broader and much more prominent, often presenting a brownish colour under the microscope. The neonatal line is the darkest band, which represents the disrupted enamel formation due to the stress of being born. It is also said to occur due to periodic bending of enamel rods. The formation of the striae of Retzius results from a constriction of Tomes' processes when the activity of ameloblasts ‚Äì cells only present in laying down enamel ‚Äì is narrowed in conjunction with an increasing process of interrod enamel development.

The name Eidophor is derived from the Greek word-roots eido and phor meaning 'image' and 'bearer' (carrier). Its basic technology was the use of electrostatic charges to deform an oil surface. Origins and use The idea for the original Eidophor was conceived in 1939 in Zurich by Swiss physicist Fritz Fischer, professor at the Labor f√ºr technische Physik of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, with the first prototype being unveiled in 1943.Winston, Brian, Media Technology and Society, 1998 Routledge, p. 23.

Retrieved 26 September 2019 and granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office (patent no. 2,391,451) to Friederich Ernst Fischer for the Process and appliance for projecting television pictures on 25 December 1945. During the Second World War, Edgar Gretener worked together with Fischer at the Institute of Technical Physics to develop a prototype. When Gretener launched his own company Dr. Edgar Gretener AG in 1941 to develop enciphering equipment for the Swiss army, he stopped working on Eidophor. Hugo Thiemann took over this responsibility at the ETH.Hugo Thiemann: Fernsehbilder im Kino ‚Äì Mit dem Eidophor beeindruckt die GRETAG Hollywoodgr√∂ssen. In: Franz Betschon et al.

After six years of work on this project at the ETH, Thiemann moved together with the project to the company Dr. Edgar Gretener AG, which was licensed by the ETH to further develop Eidophor, following Fischer‚Äôs death in 1947. An original August 1952 magazine article in the Radio and Television News credits the development of the Eidophor to Edgar Gretener. Following the Second World War, a first demonstration of an Eidophor system as a cinema video projector was organized in the Cinema Theater REX in Zurich to show successfully a TV broadcast on April 1958. An even more promising perspective was the interest of Paramount Pictureshttp://issuu.com/boxoffice/docs/boxoffice_071048http://www.terramedia.co.uk/media/cinema- television/cinema_television_chronology.htm and 20th Century FoxIlias Chrissochoidis (ed.), Spyros P.

Over 100 cinemas were set up for the project, which failed because of financial losses and the refusal of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to grant theatre owners their own UHF bands for presentation.Winston, Brian, Misunderstanding Media, 1986 Taylor & Francis, p. 81. Eidophors used an optical system somewhat similar to a conventional movie projector, but substituted a slowly rotating mirrored disk or dish for the film. The disk was covered with a thin film of transparent high-viscosity oil, and through the use of a scanned electron beam, electrostatic charges could be deposited onto the oil, causing its surface to deform. Light was shone on the disc by a striped mirror consisting of strips of reflective material alternating with transparent non-reflective areas. Areas of the oil unaffected by the electron beam would allow the light to be reflected directly back to the mirror and towards the light source, whereas light passing through deformed areas would be displaced and would pass through the adjacent transparent areas and onwards through the projection system. As the disk rotated, a doctor blade discharged and smoothed the ripples in the oil, readying it for re-use on another television frame.Ernst Baumann: DER EIDOPHOR - EINE SCHWEIZERISCHE ENTWICKLUNG DER FERNSEH- GROSSPROJEKTION. Neujahrsblatt, Naturforschende Gesellschaft in Z√ºrich, Jahr 1961. Gebr. Fretz AG, Z√ºrich. Retrieved 26 September 2019 The Mission Control room in Houston featured Eidophor projection systems. The Eidophor was a large and cumbersome device and not commonly used until there was a need for good- quality large-screen projection. This opportunity arose as part of the NASA space program, where the technology was deployed in mission control. Eidophors were also used in stadiums by touring music groups for live event visual amplification. Simple Eidophors produced black-and-white images. Later units used a color wheel (equivalent to the color television standard CBS tried to bring to the market against RCA/NBC's FCC-approved NTSC system, and today's DLP projection system) to produce red, green, and blue fields. The last models produced used separate red, green, and blue units in a single case. The Eidophor was 80 times brighter than CRT projectors of the time. The last Eidophors were able to project colour images of up to 18 metres in width. Advances in projection television technology in the 1990s brought about the end of the Eidophor. An early prototype of a new type of projector with limited resolution using a passive matrix-addressed Liquid Crystal Display was shown at a conference in San Francisco by Swiss engineer Peter J. Wild already in 1972.P. J. Wild: Matrix-addressed Liquid Crystal Projection Display. Digest of Technical Papers, International Symposium, Society for Information Display, June 1972, pp. 62‚Äì63 The new devices, using active matrix addressing of LCDs were smaller and cheaper and produced results comparable with Eidophor. Current technologies include liquid-crystal display (LCD) and digital light processing (DLP) projectors, both of which produce superior results from easily portable devices.

Education and teaching A native Oklahoman and graduate of Deep Springs College, Dodge first traveled to the USSR in 1955, ostensibly to study tractors as part of his research for a PhD from Harvard University. He completed his doctorate in 1960, with the thesis Trends in Labor Productivity in the Soviet Tractor Industry: a Case Study in Industrial Development. Johns Hopkins University Press published his research on women's roles in the Soviet economy in 1966 as Women in the Soviet Economy : Their Role in Economic, Scientific, and Technical Development. Dodge was a professor of economics at the University of Maryland, College Park for over twenty years until 1980 when he took a post at St. Mary's College in southern Maryland. He retired from St. Mary's in 1989. Art collection A Sovietologist who did pioneering work on the role of women under Joseph Stalin, Dodge smuggled into the West the works of dissident artists, painters and sculptors in the former Soviet Union. He continued to acquire art and meet clandestinely with artists, often at great personal risk, till the death of dissident artist Evgeny Rukhin and the coming of perestroika. He managed to smuggle nearly 10,000 works of art from the USSR to the United States during the height of the Cold War. Dodge's role in the preservation and patronage of art disallowed by the government led to Elena Kornetchuk calling him \\"the Lorenzo de' Medici of Russian art.\\" Dodge's work is detailed at length in John McPhee's The Ransom of Russian Art (1994). Dodge appears in an Andrei Zagdansky documentary Vasya (2002) about a Russian Nonconformist artist Vasily Sitnikov. The latest award- winning documentary about Norton Dodge and his unique art collection \\"The Russian Concept: Reflections on Russian Non-Conformist Art\\" was produced in 2009 by Igor Sopronenko. The Norton and Nancy Dodge Collection of Soviet Nonconformist Art, which contains roughly 20,000 works of art, was donated to Rutgers University in the mid-1990s, where it is on permanent display at the University's Jane Voorhees Zimmerli Art Museum. The Dodge Collection includes work by Russian painter Irina Nakhova, who in 2015 was selected as the first female artist to represent Russia in a solo show in its pavilion at the Venice Biennale.Irina Nakhova to Represent Russia in 2015 Venice Biennale Dodge is one of the founding board members of the Kolodzei Art Foundation, a US-based group dedicated to advancing the study of Russian non-conformist art.

First Baptist Church at night The first permanent home for the Church was at Third and Nicollet, and was the largest meeting hall in Minneapolis. With the rapid growth of the city a larger building was built at 5th and Hennepin in 1857 serving the congregation until the present structure was built in 1885 at 10th street and Hennepin avenue. The building was designed by the firm of Kees and Fisk, which later became the firm of Long and Kees. It is built of Kasota limestone in a blend of the Romanesque and Gothic revival styles. The original steeples were blown down in a 1967 windstorm. William Bell Riley, known as \\"The Grand Old Man of Fundamentalism,\\" served as pastor of the church for forty-five years (1897-1942) and another five as pastor emeritus until his death in 1947. He also founded the Northwestern Bible Training School along with an Evangelical Seminary, now known as University of Northwestern - St. Paul. Today, First Baptist Church is part of the Conservative Baptist Association of America. In 1871 a group of Swedish attendees at First Baptist Church formed Bethlehem Baptist Church (Minneapolis).

History  Commonly known as Skaramaga Shipyards (Greek: ŒùŒ±œÖœÄŒ∑Œ≥ŒµŒØŒ± Œ£Œ∫Œ±œÅŒ±ŒºŒ±Œ≥Œ∫Œ¨), from the area where they are located, its origins are connected with the Royal Hellenic Naval Shipyard created in 1937 in order to build warships. Despite heavy investment and an order of 12 destroyers and a number of submarines (of which 2 destroyers were in initial stages of construction), development ceased due to the Second World War while in 1944 the facilities were virtually destroyed by Allied bombing. Operation started in 1957 when Greek business tycoon Stavros Niarchos purchased the ruined shipyard and rebuilt and expanded its facilities; since then the company has built many civilian and military ships. Military constructions include Greek-designed fast patrol boats and gunboats, as well as frigates, fast attack crafts, submarines, etc. based on French or German designs. A company division is involved in metal and machinery constructions, including specialized constructions for the Greek industry, structures and platforms for offshore drilling, cranes, etc. A special branch has also been created since 1986, for the mass production of various types of railcars (diesel and electric) and railroad cars (passenger and freight), mostly on German designs. The company was bought in 2002 by a group of German investors under the industrial leadership of the German shipyard Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW), later a subsidiary of the German ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. However, sector problems have led to a progressive decline of the shipyard. The number of employees was reduced to 1,300 in 2009 (from about 6,200 in 1975) after serious economic problems.L.S.

The vessel was ordered on 23 June 2000 and constructed by Navantia in Spain. The ship was launched on 23 November 2007 and commissioned on 29 November 2009. Named for Helge Ingstad, a Norwegian explorer, the Fridjtof Nansen class are capable of anti-air, anti-submarine and surface warfare. On 8 November 2018, HNoMS Helge Ingstad collided with the tanker in Norwegian waters just outside Sture Terminal. Helge Ingstad was severely damaged in the collision and beached. On 13 November 2018, the ship sank where she had run aground and became a constructive total loss. She was raised in a salvage operation from 27 February 2019 to 3 March 2019. In June 2019 after it was deemed uneconomical to repair her, it was decided that she would be scrapped. Design and description The design of the s began in 1997. Based on the design, Izar (later Navantia) of Spain and Lockheed Martin were chosen to construct the vessel. The class is designed for operational flexibility with each ship capable of anti-air, anti-submarine and surface warfare. This was done to allow vessels of the class to operate with more ease in international operations. The Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates measure long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The frigates have a standard displacement of . The frigates are propelled by one bow thruster and two controllable pitch propellers powered by a CODAG system with one GE LM2500 gas turbine rated at and two Baz√°n Bravo 12V diesel engines rated at . This gives the frigates a maximum speed of and a range of at . The ships are fitted with a landing pad for one NH90 helicopter. The class are armed with an octuple launcher for Kongsberg Naval Strike Missiles for surface warfare. The launcher is located amidships, behind the forward superstructure. For anti-air warfare, the Fridjtof Nansens are equipped with an octuple American Mk 41 vertical launch system for 32 RIM-162 ESSM surface-to-air missiles located ahead of the forward superstructure and aft the single-mounted OTO Melara Super Rapid gun. The ships also mount two twin-mounted torpedo tubes for Sting Ray torpedoes, each mount slotted amidships on either side of the aft superstructure. The frigates also mount depth charges, four Browning M2HB heavy machine guns, four Protector (RWS) (Sea PROTECTOR) and two Long Range Acoustic Devices. For sensors, the frigates are equipped with a Lockheed Martin AN/SPY-1F 3-D multi- function radar, Reutech RSR 210N air/sea surveillance radar, Sagem VIGY 20 electro-optical director, MRS 2000 hull-mounted sonar, Captas MK II V1 active/passive towed sonar and two Mark 82 fire-control radar. The Fridjtof Nansen class use the Aegis combat system and Link 11 and is fitted for Link 16/22 combat data systems. For signal defence, the class operates the Terma DL-12T decoy launcher and Loki torpedo countermeasure systems. The vessels have a complement of over 120 personnel. Construction and service The ship was ordered for construction on 23 June 2000 by Norway and built by the Spanish shipbuilders Navantia at Ferrol, Spain. The vessel was the fourth of the Fridtjof Nansen class to be constructed, and was laid down on 28 April 2006. Construction had been delayed by disputes over quality control. The frigate was launched on 23 November 2007 and named for the Norwegian explorer Helge Ingstad. Helge Ingstad was commissioned in the Royal Norwegian Navy on 29 September 2009. From December 2013 to May 2014, Helge Ingstad was one of the escort ships for merchant vessels carrying chemical weapons from Syria to be destroyed. Helge Ingstad in Norway's S√∏rfjord in June 2018 Collision with oil tanker On 8 November 2018, while returning from a NATO exercise, she was navigating inshore waters north of Bergen at speeds of up to . Starting from around 03:40 there was a watch handover on board Helge Ingstad, during which three oncoming vessels were noted. After radio communication was established, and upon being asked to alter course to starboard, to avoid the , 112,939 t, Maltese-flagged oil tanker Sola TS, escorted by VSP Tenax, which had just left its berth, Helge Ingstad believed the vessel calling them to be one of the oncoming vessels they were tracking on radar. Assuming the tanker, slow moving and with its bright deck lights obscuring its navigation lights, to be part of the shore installation, the frigate intended passing it before altering course moving near her starboard channel margin. By the time they realised their error they were within of Sola TS and it was too late to avoid a collision. Preben Ottesen, the ship's commanding officer, stated that he was asleep in his cabin when the collision happened, and was in fact woken by the collision. The collision caused severe damage to Helge Ingstad, which lost control of engine and steering, with a large breach along her side from the starboard torpedo launchers to the stern. The vessel grounded and continued to take on water, through the propeller shaft and stuffing boxes. Seven sailors were injured in the incident. By late morning she had developed a severe list to starboard with most of the stern submerged. Despite damage control efforts the vessel sank in the early hours of 13 November, with only small sections of the superstructure remaining above water. The failure of the vessel's watertight integrity led to an immediate safety alert to designers Navantia, calling on them to advise operators of similar vessels on any necessary measures to address safety. This is the first incident of such scale in the Royal Norwegian Navy since 1994, when was lost after it ran aground. Unlike Helge Ingstad, Sola TS only suffered minor damages in its front and was never in danger of sinking. She was able to continue to her destination after the incident. The tanker subsequently sailed to a shipyard in Gda≈Ñsk for repairs and was back in regular service by late December 2018. Following the frigate's sinking, a local fish farming company, which had had to move fish from the area due to spill of diesel oil from the vessel, claimed one million kroner (US$ 116,000) in damages from the Ministry of Defence. =Salvage operations= The Norwegian Navy inspected Helge Ingstad by the Norwegian Blueye Pioneer underwater drone. Poor weather hampered salvage operations through December 2018; with the planned date to raise the ship being delayed until late January 2019. The lifting operation began on 26 February 2019. On 27 February 2019, due to weather concerns, the partially raised ship was moved to a location which is better protected from the elements, where further salvage work took place. The ship and the two heavy lift vessels (Rambiz and Gulliver) reached the Semco Maritime yard at Han√∏ytangen on 28 February 2019. Boarding parties consisting of some 300 people, including around 100 members of Helge Ingstads original crew, assisted in pumping out the remaining water so that the ship could be placed on a barge and fully salvaged. Helge Ingstad was successfully placed on a barge on 2 March 2019 Boa barge 33 carrying Helge Ingstad arrived at the Haakonsvern naval base on 3 March 2019. In May 2019 the cost of repairing the frigate was estimated at 12 billion NOK (approximately EUR 1.2 billion), implying that it would be cheaper to build a new ship. However, restarting production for just one ship could result in a disproportionally high per-ship cost. =Investigation= The Accident Investigation Board Norway (AIBN) and the Defence Accident Investigation Board Norway (DAIBN) immediately began a joint investigation, with the involvement of the Marine Safety Investigation Unit of Malta. On 29 November 2018 the AIBN published their preliminary accident report together with two interim safety recommendations. It recommended that the Norwegian military authorities investigate the findings of the preliminary report with a view to implementing any necessary safety measures, and that the shipbuilder Navantia investigate relevant aspects of the design of the frigate and whether other ships might be similarly affected. The watertight condition of the ship was supposedly guaranteed by the 13 watertight bulkheads. Seven compartments were damaged as a result of the collision but initially the ship remained afloat. No one intervened to break the chain of errors. If the commander had observed COLREGS the collision would not have occurred. On 14 May 2019 it was reported the cost of repairing Helge Ingstad would exceed US$1.4 billion, according to the Forsvaret, nearly three times the original cost to build her.

Professional wrestling career  Madril began his wrestling career in 1970. During the first half of the decade, he competed in Pacific Northwest Wrestling, the Portland, Oregon-based division of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). While there, he formed a tag team known as The Compadres with Jos√© Gonz√°lez and won the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship on July 2, 1973. Wrestling under the ring name Leo Madril, he also competed in the Vancouver, British Columbia-based NWA All-Star Wrestling. He held the Vancouver version of the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship twice, teaming with Flash Gordon for the first win, and Dan Kroffat for the second. Competing once again under his real name, Madril then moved to Texas to continue his career. In 1975, he won the NWA Texas Heavyweight Championship on three occasions, defeating El Gran Marcus for the first and John Tolos for the others. He also teamed with Jose Lothario that year to win the NWA Texas Tag Team Championship twice. Late in his career, Madril was a traveling partner of Shawn Michaels, who was trained by his former tag team partner Lothario. Michaels credits Madril with helping him develop an appreciation for the music of Elvis Presley. After adopting his \\"Heartbreak Kid\\" gimmick in the early 1990s, Michaels went on to host an interview segment in the World Wrestling Federation named the Heartbreak Hotel, after one of Presley's songs. Madril was involved in a rather high-profile feud with the Von Erich family in late 1986 and much of 1987, when he formed a tag team sometimes referred to as the \\"Duo of Doom\\" with Brian Adias, who turned heel after accusing the Von Erichs of holding him back and preventing him from succeeding on his own merits. During one especially memorable incident, Kerry Von Erich, who was Brian's high school classmate in real life, confronted him regarding his actions. Still on crutches following his June 1986 motorcycle accident, Kerry was attacked by Madril, with Adias standing aside and allowing Madril to hit Kerry with one of the crutches several times before referee Marc Lowrance finally managed to get Kerry out of the ring. Afterwards, Kevin Von Erich ran in and launched an attack on Madril.

Summary The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, Cytowic describes his chance encounter during a dinner party on February 10, 1980 with MW, the \\"Man Who Tasted Shapes.\\" Cytowic describes how his host reported that \\"There aren't enough points on the chicken!\\"p. 3 and how this chance comment led to Cytowic's investigations of the neurological phenomenon of synesthesia. Early chapters include background information on how the brain is organized, drawn mainly from Paul D. MacLean's Triune Brain theory. Cytowic describes MW's synesthesia, noting the consistency of his reports, that such experiences are \\"generic\\" and consistent over time.see also: Chapters dealing with more scientific theories, data and experimentation are alternated with autobiographical and more personal chapters describing the historical details of Cytowic's investigations into synesthesia. In order to explore the biological basis of synesthesia, Cytowic describes experiments in which he tested how MW's synesthesia was reduced by MW's daily routine of stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine and depressants such as alcohol.p.139 In more intensive investigations of the effects of different psychoactive substances, Cytowic notes that stimulants, including a dose of amphetamine decreased the strength of MW's synesthesia, while amyl nitrite increased the strength of MW's synesthesia.p. 122 and p. 139-145 For example, MW reports that mint feels like a cool glass column, but that amyl nitrite led him to feel as if he were placing his hand among many glass columns.p. 122 Cytowic also summarizes work done with functional neuroimaging which showed unusually low cortical activation in MW. Based on these results, Cytowic proposes a theory in which synesthesia is a result of unusual processing in the limbic system and an overall decrease in cortical activation.see also: In later chapters, Cytowic reports on his efforts to make synesthesia more widely known, on the experiences of many other synesthetes who have contacted him, and how synesthesia affects their lives. Cytowic describes how an article about his work on synesthesia in the tabloid The National Enquirer, a publication which is \\"not known to help one's career\\"p.111 led to his first contacts with synesthetes beyond MWChapter 14: p. 111-117 These personal accounts of synesthesia, described here in more autobiographical style, also form the basis of Cytowic's more detailed scientific book, Synesthesia: A Union of the Senses. Additionally, Cytowic discusses the links between synesthesia and memory, as first noted in Alexander Luria's book The Mind of Mnemonist about Solomon Shereshevskii, a Russian mnemonist who also experienced fivefold synesthesia.p. 32-34 In the second part of the book, entitled \\"Essays on the Primacy of Emotion\\", Cytowic presents a number of his reflections on what the phenomenon of synesthesia means for traditional neuroscientific and neurological practice, how anomalous findings can lead to major scientific discoveries, and the role that emotion plays in our understanding of the world around us.

After the 1967 SCL merger, these cars were fitted with rotary couplers and used in Bone Valley phosphate service. A covered hopper is a self-clearing enclosed railroad freight car with fixed roof, sides, and ends with openings for loading through the roof and bottom openings for unloading. Covered hopper cars are designed for carrying dry bulk loads, varying from grain to products such as sand and clay. The cover protects the loads from the weather. Dry cement would be very hard to unload if mixed with water in transit, while grain would be likely to rot if exposed to rain.  History  While hopper cars had long been used to carry mined products like coal, ore, and gravel; boxcars were used for granular materials requiring protection from moisture until waterproof covers were devised for hopper cars. Gravity flow through the bottom of the hopper car simplifies unloading granular bulk commodities. Although removable canvas covers are sometimes used to protect moisture sensitive commodities in open hopper cars, a metal top with waterproof loading hatches provides superior protection. These loading hatches along the top of the covered hopper may be a single long opening along the centerline or a pattern of multiple round or square openings positioned to allow uniform weight distribution when loading the car. Some covered hoppers have two to four separated bays. Each of these can be loaded and emptied individually, with access at the top to load the materials and visible chutes at the bottom for unloading. Early production emphasized two-bay cars very similar to open coal hoppers and suitable for materials of similar density, like Portland cement or rock-salt. Some cars were available in the 1910s, and became more common by the 1940s. These early cars were volume-limited for less dense commodities like grain or sugar, so later designs include longer covered hopper cars with higher sides and three or more bottom bays. Increasing axle load limits have allowed some of the heavier loads formerly assigned to two- bay hoppers to be assigned to larger, more efficient three-bay hoppers. This two-bay Centerflow CSX Hopper being switched in Knoxville, Tennessee shows off the new \\"How tomorrow moves\\" slogan. Some covered hopper cars retain the conventional centersill as a strength member transmitting compression and tension forces from one car to the next. Beginning in the 1960s, designs distributing these forces along the sides of the car eliminated the centersill beam to simplify bulk material handling with wider hopper openings reducing the tendency for bridging to restrict gravity flow when unloading the car. Large unit trains of various grain crops are a common sight in North America, reaching up to 125 cars long. These predominantly haul grain from the large farming areas of the Great Plains to various markets, but a number of unit trains originate from other major farming areas, such as Illinois and Indiana. These trains may originate from a single grain elevator, or may be marshaled in a yard from various locals (short trains which serve nearby industries). The destinations tend to be large flour mills or ports (for export), or they may be split up and delivered to multiple locations. The empty cars may return as a whole train, or may be sent back in smaller quantities on manifest trains (trains which carry just about any type of freight). These trains are used primarily for hauling products such as corn, wheat and barley.

As is custom among the Inhumans, Gorgon was exposed to the Terrigen Mists as a teenager, gaining increased strength, while his feet were transformed to hooves, capable of generating highly destructive seismic waves. As an adult, Gorgon became Black Bolt's personal bodyguard and is responsible for training youths recently exposed to the Terrigen Mists in the use of their newly acquired powers and abilities. Gorgon first leaves the Inhuman city of Attilan to rescue Medusa (suffering from amnesia at the time), who became lost in the outside world. This leads to a battle with the Fantastic Four, who rescued Medusa from the supervillain team the Frightful Four.Fantastic Four #44 (Nov. 1965) After making contact with the outside world, Gorgon and the rest of the Royal Family have several encounters with the Fantastic Four over the years, seeking their aid against foes such as Black Bolt's brother Maximus,Fantastic Four #45-47 (Dec. 1965 ‚Äì Feb. 1966); #82-83 (Jan. ‚Äì Feb. 1969) Psycho- Man,Fantastic Four King-Size Special #5 (Nov. 1967) and the Sphinx.Fantastic Four Annual #12 (1977) With several other Inhumans, Gorgon also battles the master villain Mandarin,Amazing Adventures #3-4 (Dec. 1970, Feb. 1971) helps free Maximus,Amazing Adventures #5 (Apr. 1971) journeys to America to search for the missing Black Bolt,Amazing Adventures #7 (Aug. 1971) and battles Magneto.Amazing Adventures #9-10 (Dec. 1971, Feb. 1972) Over the years, and with continued exposure to the outside world, Gorgon has many adventures, usually taking place in the company of fellow members of the Royal Family.Inhumans #1-12 (Oct. 1975 ‚Äì Aug. 1977); Inhumans vol. 2, #1-12 (1998 ‚Äì 1999); Inhumans vol. 3, #1-4 (2000); Inhumans vol. 4, #1-12 (2003‚Äì2004) Significant moments for Gorgon include defying the Attilan Genetics Council and helping to hide the pregnant Medusa (with Black Bolt's child) on Earth;Marvel Graphic Novel: The Inhumans (1988) and arguing with Black Bolt over the use of Alpha Primitives as slaves.Black Panther #20 (2005) He leads an Inhuman force down to Earth to gain the return of the Terrigen Mists. This goes badly as many human captives are slain by an impatient Inhuman named Jolen. This sparks a war between Earth and the Inhumans, and Gorgon is captured. He is subjected to the Terrigen Mists again. This amplifies Gorgon's powers and change him into a true beast with a lion-like head, claws, and uncontrollable rages.Silent War #1-6 (2006‚Äì2007) As with the other Inhumans, he leaves the Moon to assist them in taking over the Kree empire.War of Kings #1-4 (2009) He is later seen with his more humanoid appearance.The Thanos Imperative #1 (2010) In the Inhuman storyline, he is shot in the spine by NuHuman named Lineage, he is paralyzed waist down and cannot use his powers.Inhuman #13 As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel, Gorgon joined the diplomatic mission created by Medusa to oversee the diplomatic relations and handle the recovery efforts of the newly transformed Inhumans. During this time, Gorgon rode around in a special wheelchair. His paralysis is later cured by NuHuman Panacea.All-New Inhumans #1-11 During the Inhumans vs. X-Men storyline, Gorgon and Crystal are ambushed by Magneto.IVX #2 Powers and abilities Gorgon's superhuman powers are a result of exposure to the mutagenic Terrigen Mist. Gorgon now has bull's legs and hooves and can create intense shockwaves equivalent to a powerful earthquake. He also possesses enhanced strength and durability, although like all Inhumans he has a weaker immune system than that of an average human. Gorgon was exposed to Terrigen Mists a second time by Pentagon officials. He then appeared larger and stronger and behaved more brutishly. These changes gradually faded.

Eye movement includes the voluntary or involuntary movement of the eyes, helping in acquiring, fixating and tracking visual stimuli. A special type of eye movement, rapid eye movement, occurs during REM sleep. The eyes are the visual organs of the human body, and move using a system of six muscles. The retina, a specialised type of tissue containing photoreceptors, senses light. These specialised cells convert light into electrochemical signals. These signals travel along the optic nerve fibers to the brain, where they are interpreted as vision in the visual cortex. Primates and many other vertebrates use three types of voluntary eye movement to track objects of interest: smooth pursuit, vergence shifts and saccades. These types of movements appear to be initiated by a small cortical region in the brain's frontal lobe. This is corroborated by removal of the frontal lobe. In this case, the reflexes (such as reflex shifting the eyes to a moving light) are intact, though the voluntary control is obliterated.\\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1987  Anatomy  = Muscles = Six extraocular muscles facilitate eye movement. These muscles arise from the common tendinous ring in the orbit, the eye cavity, and attach to the eyeball. The six muscles are the lateral, medial, inferior and superior rectus muscles, and the inferior and superior oblique muscles. The muscles, when contracting, cause movement of the eyeball, by pulling the eyeball towards the muscle. For example, the lateral rectus is on the lateral side of the eyeball. When it contracts, the eyeball moves so that the pupil looks outwards. The medial rectus causes the eyeball to look inwards; the inferior rectus downwards and the superior rectus upwards. The superior oblique muscle and inferior oblique muscle attach at angles to the eyeball. Most muscles not only move the eye in a cardinal direction, but also slightly rotate the pupil. Schematic demonstrating the actions and cranial nerve innervation (in subscript) of extraocular muscles. Three antagonistic pairs of muscles control eye movement: the lateral and medial rectus muscles, the superior and inferior rectus muscles, and the superior and inferior oblique muscles. These muscles are responsible for movement of the eye along three different axes: horizontal, either toward the nose (adduction) or away from the nose (abduction); vertical, either elevation or depression; and torsional, movements that bring the top of the eye toward the nose (intorsion) or away from the nose (extorsion). Horizontal movement is controlled entirely by the medial and lateral rectus muscles; the medial rectus muscle is responsible for adduction, the lateral rectus muscle for abduction. Vertical movement requires the coordinated action of the superior and inferior rectus muscles, as well as the oblique muscles. The relative contribution of the rectus and oblique groups depends on the horizontal position of the eye. In the primary position (eyes straight ahead), both of these groups contribute to vertical movement. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus and inferior oblique muscles, while depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles. When the eye is abducted, the rectus muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the superior rectus, and depression is due to the action of the inferior rectus. When the eye is adducted, the oblique muscles are the prime vertical movers. Elevation is due to the action of the inferior oblique muscle, while depression is due to the action of the superior oblique muscle. The oblique muscles are also primarily responsible for torsional movement. The muscles are supplied by the oculomotor nerve, with the exception of the superior oblique, which is supplied by the trochlear nerve, and the lateral rectus, supplied by the abducens nerve.Purves D, Augustine GJ, Fitzpatrick D, et al., editors. Neuroscience. 2nd edition. Sunderland (MA): Sinauer Associates; 2001. The Actions and Innervation of Extraocular Muscles. Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10793/ = Neuroanatomy = The brain exerts ultimate control over both voluntary and involuntary eye movement. Three cranial nerves carry signals from the brain to control the extraocular muscles. These are the oculomotor nerve, which controls the majority of the muscles, the trochlear nerve, which controls the superior oblique muscle, and the abducens nerve, which controls the lateral rectus muscle. In addition to the movement of muscles, numerous areas in the brain contribute to involuntary and voluntary eye movement. These include providing the conscious perception of vision, as well as areas that facilitate tracking. * Brain ** Cerebral cortex *** Frontal lobe ‚Äì frontal eye fields (FEF), medial eye fields (MEF), supplementary eye fields (SEF), dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) *** Parietal lobe ‚Äì Lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP), middle temporal area (MT), medial superior temporal area (MST) *** Occipital lobe **** Visual cortex ** Cerebellum * Midbrain ** Pretectal area ‚Äì Pretectal nuclei ** Superior colliculus (SC) ** Premotor nuclei in the reticular formation (PMN) ***riMLF ** III, IV cranial nerve nuclei * Pons ** Paramedian pontine reticular formation (PMRF) ** Nucleus prepositus hypoglossi ** Vestibular nuclei ** VI cranial nerve nuclei * Medial longitudinal fasciculus  Physiology  Eye movement can be classified according to several systems: * It may be classified according to the involvement of one or both eyes; involving one eye they may be classified as duction, and both eyes either version, if moving in the same direction, or vergence, if moving in opposite directions.Kanski, JJ.

EyeWeb.org. * it may be classified as fixational, gaze-stabilizing, or gaze-shifting. Gaze- stabilising movement may include the vestibulo-ocular reflex and optokinetic reflex, and gaze-shifting mechanisms as saccades and pursuit movements. Vergence movement or convergence is the movement of both eyes to make sure that the image of the object being looked at falls on the corresponding spot on both retinas. This type of movement helps in the depth perception of objectsCarlson and Heth (2010). Psychology the Science of Behaviour 4e. Pearson Education Canada. Page 140 Pursuit movement or smooth pursuit is the movement the eyes make while tracking an object's movement, so that its moving image can remain maintained on fovea. =Saccades= The eyes are never completely at rest: they make frequent fixational eye movement even when fixated at one point. The reason for this movement is related to the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells. It appears that a constant visual stimulus can make the photoreceptors or the ganglion cells become unresponsive; on the other hand a changing stimulus will not. So the eye movement constantly changes the stimuli that fall on the photoreceptors and the ganglion cells, making the image clearer. Saccades are the rapid movement of eyes that is used while scanning a visual scene. In our subjective impression, the eyes do not move smoothly across the printed page during reading. Instead, they make short and rapid movements called saccades.Wayne S. Murray. Behavioral and Brain Sciences(2003)26, page 446 During each saccade the eyes move as fast as they can and the speed cannot be consciously controlled in between the fixations. Each movement is worth a few minutes of arc, at regular intervals about three to four per second. One of the main uses for saccades is to scan a greater area with the high-resolution fovea of the eye.John Findlay Saccadic eye movement programming: sensory and attentional factors, Psychological Research (March 2009), 73 (2), pg. 127‚Äì135 Research conducted by the University of South Australia in partnership with the University of Stuttgart has revealed the relationship between eye moment and personality traits that AI can read. =Vestibulo-ocular system= The visual system in the brain is too slow to process that information if the images are slipping across the retina at more than a few degrees per second. Thus, to be able to see while we are moving, the brain must compensate for the motion of the head by turning the eyes. Another specialisation of visual system in many vertebrate animals is the development of a small area of the retina with a very high visual acuity. This area is called the fovea, and covers about 2 degrees of visual angle in people. To get a clear view of the world, the brain must turn the eyes so that the image of the object of regard falls on the fovea. Eye movement is thus very important for visual perception, and any failure can lead to serious visual disabilities. To see a quick demonstration of this fact, try the following experiment: hold your hand up, about one foot (30 cm) in front of your nose. Keep your head still, and shake your hand from side to side, slowly at first, and then faster and faster. At first you will be able to see your fingers quite clearly. But as the frequency of shaking passes about 1 Hz, the fingers will become a blur. Now, keep your hand still, and shake your head (up and down or left and right). No matter how fast you shake your head, the image of your fingers remains clear. This demonstrates that the brain can move the eyes opposite to head motion much better than it can follow, or pursue, a hand movement. When your pursuit system fails to keep up with the moving hand, images slip on the retina and you see a blurred hand. The brain must point both eyes accurately enough that the object of regard falls on corresponding points of the two retinas to avoid the perception of double vision. In most vertebrates (humans, mammals, reptiles, birds), the movement of different body parts is controlled by striated muscles acting around joints. The movement of the eye is slightly different in that the eyes are not rigidly attached to anything, but are held in the orbit by six extraocular muscles. * Hering's law of equal innervation * Sherrington's law of reciprocal innervation Reading When reading, the eye moves continuously along a line of text, but makes short rapid movements (saccades) intermingled with short stops (fixations). There is considerable variability in fixations (the point at which a saccade jumps to) and saccades between readers and even for the same person reading a single passage of text. =Music reading= Eye movement in music reading is the scanning of a musical score by a musician's eyes. This usually occurs as the music is read during performance, although musicians sometimes scan music silently to study it, and sometimes perform from memory without score. Eye movement in music reading may at first appear to be similar to that in language reading, since in both activities the eyes move over the page in fixations and saccades, picking up and processing coded meanings. However, music is nonlinguistic and involves a strict and continuous time constraint on an output that is generated by a continuous stream of coded instructions. Scene viewing Eye movement in scene viewing refers to the visual processing of information presented in scenes. A core aspect of studies in this area is the division of eye movements into the rapid movement of the eyes (saccades), and the focus of the eyes on a point (fixations). Several factors can influence eye movement in scene viewing, including the task and knowledge of the viewer (top-down factors), and the properties of the image being viewed (bottom-up factors). Typically, when presented with a scene, viewers demonstrate short fixation durations and long saccade amplitudes in the earlier phases of viewing an image. This is followed by longer fixations and shorter saccades in the latter phases of scene viewing processing. It has also been found that eye movement behaviour in scene viewing differs with levels of cognitive development - fixation durations are thought to shorten and saccade amplitudes lengthen with an increase in age. =Spatial variation= Where eye movements fixate is affected by both bottom-up and top- down factors. Even an initial glimpse of a scene has an influence on subsequent eye movements. In bottom-up factors, the local contrast or prominence of features in an image, such as a large contrast in luminance or a greater density of edges, can affect the guidance of eye movements. However, the top-down factors of scenes have a greater impact in where eyes fixate. Areas containing more meaningful features, or areas where colour aids the discrimination of objects, can influence eye movements. Images which are related to previous images shown can also have an effect. Eye movements can also be guided towards items when they are heard verbally at the same time as seeing them. Cross-culturally, it has been found that Westerners have an inclination to concentrate on focal objects in a scene, whereas East Asians attend more to contextual information. =Temporal variation= Average fixation durations last for about 330 ms, although there is a large variability in this approximation. This variability is mostly due to the properties of an image and in the task being carried out, which impact both bottom-up and top-down processing. The masking of an image and other degradations, such as a decrease in luminance, during fixations (factors which affect bottom-up processing), have been found to increase the length of fixation durations. However, an enhancement of the image with these factors also increases fixation durations. Factors which affect top-down processing (e.g. blurring) have been found to both increase and decrease fixation durations.

The superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve). Incyclotorsion may also be used to describe one part of the condition of the eye when a patient has an oculomotor nerve palsy. The oculomotor nerve (cranial nerve III) supplies the inferior oblique muscle (along with four other eye muscles ‚Äì superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus and the striated muscle of levator palpebrae superioris), and when this muscle is non-functional (as in oculomotor palsy) the eye incyclotorts; i.e. twists/rotates inward. * Excyclotorsion is a term applied to the outward, torsional (rotational) movement of the eye, mediated by the inferior oblique muscle of the eye. The inferior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve). Excyclotorsion may also be used to describe the condition or state of the eye when a patient has a cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) palsy. The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle, and when this muscle is non-functional (as in trochlear palsy) the eye excyclotorts; i.e. twists/rotates outward. This excyclotorsion may be corrected through surgery using the Harada-Ito procedure.1\\\\. http://www.utdol.com/online/content/topic.do?topicKey=neuro_op/2892&selectedTitle;=1~150&source;=search_result * A version is an eye movement involving both eyes moving synchronously and symmetrically in the same direction.

The road begins at the Schuylkill Expressway in Fairmount Park, running as a freeway also known as the Roosevelt Boulevard Extension or the Roosevelt Expressway through North Philadelphia, then transitioning into a twelve-lane divided highway that forms the spine of Northeast Philadelphia to its end at the city line. Historically, Roosevelt Boulevard is a part of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America, which ran for from Times Square in New York City to Lincoln Park on the Pacific Ocean in San Francisco, California. Today, Roosevelt Boulevard is designated as US 1 (north of the Roosevelt Expressway), US 13 (between Hunting Park Avenue and Robbins Street), and Pennsylvania Route 63 (between Red Lion and Woodhaven Roads). The road is notorious for two intersections which have been designated the second and third most dangerous intersections in the country by State Farm Insurance, at Red Lion Road and Grant Avenue respectively. The dangerous reputation of the road led to installation of the first red light cameras in Philadelphia in 2004. The road has been the scene of numerous pedestrian casualties and studies are underway to allow pedestrian traffic to be separated from vehicular traffic. Route description Roosevelt Boulevard at Rhawn Street, looking north toward Pennypack Circle =Roosevelt Expressway= The Roosevelt Boulevard Extension, also known as the Roosevelt Expressway, begins at the Schuylkill Expressway in Fairmount Park adjacent to the Philadelphia city line, as an expressway also known as the Roosevelt Boulevard Expressway U.S. Route 1. It crosses the Schuylkill River via the Twin Bridges and runs eastward through the neighborhoods of East Falls and Hunting Park. The Roosevelt Expressway interchanges with Broad Street (Pennsylvania Route 611) and ends at an interchange with US 13 (Roosevelt Boulevard), at which point US 1 merges onto the Roosevelt Boulevard and continues northeast along with US 13. =Roosevelt Boulevard= The Roosevelt Boulevard begins at an intersection with Hunting Park Avenue, continuing northeast as a part of US 13. The road crosses Broad Street (PA 611) before US 1 (Roosevelt Expressway) merges in at an interchange and Roosevelt Boulevard becomes a 12-lane surface arterial with local and express lanes and at-grade intersections, carrying US 1 and US 13. The road continues east through Hunting Park and Feltonville, where it curves and starts running in a northeasterly direction. It meets Oxford Avenue (Pennsylvania Route 232) at a large traffic circle known as Oxford Circle (the express lanes pass through the circle via an underpass). The road carries northbound U.S. Route 13 one more mile until it splits off onto Robbins Street and Levick Street (both one-way streets). The road continues to a large interchange with Cottman Avenue (Pennsylvania Route 73) and the Roosevelt Mall. The traffic circle with Holme and Solly Avenues known as the Pennypack Circle was rebuilt and no longer exists. There is access to both Solly and Holme Avenues from the local lanes both north and south bound. It continues past Pennypack Park and Northeast Philadelphia Airport, passing through two notoriously dangerous intersections with Grant Avenue and Red Lion Road. The road continues northeast, interchanging with Woodhaven Road (Pennsylvania Route 63), then narrowing as it approaches its end at an intersection on the Philadelphia-Bucks County border. After 2 traffic light intersections in Trevose in Bensalem Township, U.S. 1 continues as a freeway to the north. Public transportation The Boulevard Direct, a limited-stop bus route that operates along a portion of Roosevelt Boulevard Several SEPTA City Bus routes operate along portions of Roosevelt Boulevard, with routes , and following the boulevard for a significant distance. The Route 1 bus runs along the entire length of Roosevelt Boulevard as part of its route between 54th Street and City Avenue in West Philadelphia and Parx Casino and Racing in Bensalem. The Route 14 bus follows Roosevelt Boulevard north of Bustleton Avenue as part of its route between the Frankford Transportation Center to the south and the Neshaminy Mall and Oxford Valley Mall to the north. The Route R bus follows Roosevelt Boulevard south of Pratt Street as part of its route between the Wissahickon Transportation Center and the Frankford Transportation Center. The portion of Roosevelt Boulevard north of Bustleton Avenue is also served by the Boulevard Direct, a limited-stop bus route between the Frankford Transportation Center and the Neshaminy Mall. The Boulevard Direct offers improved travel times compared to traditional bus service along Route 14, with more frequent service and several bus stops located on the far side of intersections to improve performance. =Proposed subway= The Roosevelt Boulevard Subway is a proposed SEPTA subway line that would run along Roosevelt Boulevard. The route was first proposed in 1913 as part of the Broad Street Subway line from Adams Avenue. Its construction has been considered at a variety of points in Philadelphia's history. Last studied in detail in 2003, a plethora of alignments and construction options were considered; including within the median of a highway that would replace the Boulevard, an alternate route that would follow and replace the current Fox Chase Line of SEPTA Regional Rail, and an at grade route that would function similarly to the city's subway-surface network. A largely underground alignment under the Boulevard was chosen that would have left the current Broad Street Line at Erie, using an already extant flying junction with the express tracks. It would have then tunneled to Roosevelt Boulevard and been constructed cut and cover until Blue Grass road near the northern edge of Philadelphia. From there its would have been on an elevated structure until almost reaching the county line. Additionally a cut and cover extension of the Market-Frankford Line was to be constructed under Bustleton Avenue until intersecting with the Boulevard. Cost estimates ranged between $2.5 and $3.4 billion in year 2000 dollars. Largely dependent on if constructing all stations in open cuts, rather than strictly underground, was feasible. It was estimated to draw 124,523 daily boardings, approximately the current ridership of the Broad Street Line, and divert 83,300 daily automobile trips.https://web.archive.org/web/20040604184318/http://www.libertynet.org/netis/ The project however did not move forward due to lack of local financing. Alternatively, an enhanced bus route similar to Pittsburgh's Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway (a BRT system) could also be implemented in its place. History Roosevelt Boulevard (US 1) northbound past Welsh Road Proposed in 1903 by Mayor Samuel H. Ashbridge as part of the City Beautiful movement, the 300-foot-wide thoroughfare originally extended from Broad Street to the Torresdale neighborhood, and was first named Torresdale Boulevard, then Northeast Boulevard in 1914 when the road was completed. On its extension to Pennypack Creek in 1918, it was finally renamed to Roosevelt Boulevard, in honor of Theodore Roosevelt. The road was designated U.S. 1 in 1926, and was extended through Philadelphia to neighboring Bucks County in the post-World War II years. The Roosevelt Expressway was built to connect the boulevard with the nearby Schuylkill Expressway (I-76). In 1998 a series of gang-related criminal rock throwing attacks on cars driving near Ridge Avenue, Henry Avenue and Fox Street \\"terrorized\\" Philadelphia drivers. In 2000, by act of the state legislature, the Boulevard was designated the \\"Police Officer Daniel Faulkner Memorial Highway\\" in memory of Daniel Faulkner, a Philadelphia police officer whom Mumia Abu-Jamal was convicted of having slain in the line of duty in 1981. The designation is alongside the roadway's official name of Roosevelt Boulevard. There have been several plans to change the boulevard into an expressway-like artery, like the Roosevelt Expressway itself, and construct a subway underneath the boulevard, but no such plans have been acted upon. Today, Roosevelt Boulevard is among the most congested arteries in the country. According to a 2001 report by State Farm Insurance, the second- and third-worst intersections in the country are both found on the Boulevard, at Red Lion Road and Grant Avenue, respectively, only a mile apart from each other. Red light cameras have been installed at these intersections, as well as Cottman Avenue, and have been operational since June 1, 2005. New cameras installed at the intersections with 9th Street, Mascher Street, Levick Street, Rhawn Street, Welsh Road, and Southampton Road became operational in summer 2007. Additional plans include adding cameras at Devereaux Avenue and Tyson Avenue. On June 1, 2020, speed cameras were activated along Roosevelt Boulevard, with a 60-day warning period before fines are issued.

History The history of the family is written in the H≈çj≈ç Godaiki. The clan is traditionally reckoned to be started by Ise Shinkur≈ç, who came from a branch of the prestigious Ise clan, descendants of Taira no Toshitsugu, a family in the direct service of the Ashikaga sh≈çguns, as close advisors and Shugo (Governor) of Yamashiro province (Ise Sadamichi since 1493). During the Imagawa clan succession crisis in 1476, Shinkur≈ç whose sister was married to Imagawa Yoshitada, Shugo (Governor) of Suruga province, became associated with the Imagawa clan. At the death of Yoshitada in battle, Shinkur≈ç went down to Suruga province to support his nephew Imagawa Ujichika. Through this relationship Shinkur≈ç quickly established a base of power in Kant≈ç. His son wanted his lineage to have a more illustrious name, and chose H≈çj≈ç, after the line of regents of the Kamakura shogunate, to which his wife also belonged. So he became H≈çj≈ç Ujitsuna, and his father, Ise Shinkur≈ç, was posthumously renamed H≈çj≈ç S≈çun. The Late H≈çj≈ç, sometimes known as the Odawara H≈çj≈ç after their home castle of Odawara in Sagami Province, were not related to the earlier H≈çj≈ç clan. Their power rivaled that of the Tokugawa clan, but eventually Toyotomi Hideyoshi eradicated the power of the H≈çj≈ç in the Siege of Odawara (1590), banishing H≈çj≈ç Ujinao and his wife Toku Hime (a daughter of Tokugawa Ieyasu) to Mount K≈çya, where Ujinao died in 1591.

(standing for Helicopter Emergency Rescue Operation) is a video game written by John Van Ryzin and published by Activision for the Atari 2600 in March 1984. It was ported to the Apple II, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, MSX, and ZX Spectrum. The player uses a helicopter backpack and other tools to rescue victims trapped deep in a mine. The mine is made up of multiple screens using a flip screen style. Sega released a version of the game for its SG-1000 console in Japan in 1985. While the gameplay was identical, Sega changed the backpack from a helicopter to a jetpack. Gameplay About to blow up a cave-in (Atari 8-bit) C64 screenshot The player assumes control of Roderick Hero (sometimes styled as \\"R. Hero\\"), a one-man rescue team. Miners working in Mount Leone are trapped, and it's up to Roderick to reach them. The player is equipped with a backpack-mounted helicopter unit, which allows him to hover and fly, along with a helmet- mounted laser and a limited supply of dynamite. Each level consists of a maze of mine shafts that Roderick must safely navigate in order to reach the miner trapped at the bottom. The backpack has a limited amount of power, so the player must reach the miner before the power supply is exhausted, in which the player restarts the level from the beginning if that happens. Mine shafts may be blocked by cave-ins or magma, which require dynamite to clear. The helmet laser can also destroy cave-ins, but far more slowly than dynamite. Unlike a cave-in, magma is lethal when touched. Later levels include walls of magma with openings that alternate between open and closed requiring skillful navigation. The mine shafts are populated by spiders, bats and other unknown creatures that are deadly to the touch; these creatures can be destroyed using the laser or dynamite. Some deep mines are flooded, forcing players to hover safely above the water. In later levels, monsters strike out from below the water. Some mine sections are illuminated by lanterns. If the lantern is somehow destroyed, the layout of that section becomes invisible. Exploding dynamite lights up the mine for a brief time. Points are scored for each cave- in cleared and each creature destroyed. When the player reaches the miner, points are awarded for the rescue, along with the amount of power remaining in the backpack and for each remaining stick of dynamite. Extra lives are awarded for every 20,000 points scored.

Rod Dreher, writing in The American Conservative, has referred to Chute as \\"a Maine novelist and gun enthusiast who, along with her husband, lives an aggressively unorthodox life in the Yankee backwoods.\\"Dreher, Rod (2006-06-05) All-American Anarchists , The American Conservative She is a recipient of the PEN New England Award. Life and work Chute's first, and best known, novel, The Beans of Egypt, Maine, was published in 1985 and made into a 1994 film of the same name, directed by Jennifer Warren. Chute's next two books, Letourneau's Used Auto Parts (1988) and Merry Men (1994), are also set in the town of Egypt, Maine, as are the books in the \\"Heart's Content\\" series (The School on Heart's Content Road [2008], Treat Us Like Dogs and We Will Become Wolves [2014], and The Recipe for Revolution [2020]). Her 1999 novel Snow Man deals with the underground militia movement, something that Chute has devoted more of her time to in recent years. She was the leader of a group which was known as the Second Maine Militia and is a fierce defender of the Second Amendment, keeping an AK-47 and a small cannon at her home in Maine. \\"A Writer in a Living Novel\\". New York Times. Retrieved on August 9, 2009. Chute also speaks out publicly about class issues in America and publishes \\"The Fringe,\\" a monthly collection of in-depth political journalism, short stories, and intellectual commentary on current events. She once ran a satiric campaign for governor of Maine. In 2008, she published The School on Heart's Content Road, which deals with a polygamist compound in Maine under scrutiny after an article on them goes national. The project was originally a novel of more than 2,000 pages, which has since been broken up into a projected five-part cycle. This was followed up by Treat Us Like Dogs and We Will Become Wolves (2014) and The Recipe for Revolution (2020). Her jobs have included waitress, chicken factory worker, hospital floor scrubber, shoe factory worker, potato farm worker, tutor, canvasser, teacher, social worker, and school bus driver, 1970s-1980s; part- time suburban correspondent, Portland Evening Express, Portland, Maine, 1976‚Äì81; instructor in creative writing, University of Southern Maine, Portland, 1985. Biography Encyclopedia Chute is closely associated with the New England Literature Program, an alternative education program run by the University of Michigan's English department during the University's spring term. NELP students transcribed her 2008 novel The School on Heart's Content Road into an electronic format. Chute was born in 1947 in Portland, Maine. She now lives in Parsonsfield, Maine, near the New Hampshire border, in a home with no telephone, no computer, and no fax machine, and an outhouse in lieu of a working bathroom. She is married to Michael Chute, a local handyman who never learned to read. She has a daughter from a previous marriage, Joannah, and 3 grandchildren. Use of politics in fiction In Chute's 2019 The Recipe for Revolution, she portrays certain white American men who have taken up \\"heavy-duty\\" white identity, describing this political orientation as a form of extreme societal grief, and associates it with being conspiracy-minded.

It is named after the Uzboy dry channel, now in Turkmenistan, which repeatedly served as the main channel of the Amu Darya river. The valley begins on the northern rim of the Argyre basin, and cuts through several craters, before ending at Holden crater. Mapbondcrater.jpgPart of Uzboi Vallis along with nearby craters. Colors relate to elevation. Uzboi Vallis is believed to have been formed by running water. It is believed that layers were formed on the floor of Uzboi Vallis (as shown in the HiRISE image below) when drainage was blocked by the impact that formed Holden Crater to the north. Eventually the lake in the area of Uzboi Vallis went high enough to overtop the rim of Holden.http://www.uahirise.org/epo/nuggets/lake-uzboi-vallis.pdf The water then eroded the deposits to expose the layers as they are today. The sediments that make up the layers appear to be coarse in size, suggesting they were probably formed by a rapid flow.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008338_1525http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_003077_1530Grant, J., T.

It has been suggested that Uzboi, Ladon, Margaritifer and Ares Valles, although now separated by large craters, once comprised a single outflow channel flowing north into Chryse Planitia.Grant, J. et al. 2010.

Argyre Planitia and the Mars global hydrologic cycle. LPSC XXXI, Abstract 2033. The source of this outflow has been suggested as overflow from the Argyre crater, formerly filled to the brim as a lake by channels (Surius, Dzigai, and Palacopus Valles) draining down from the south pole. If real, the full length of this drainage system would be over 8000 km, the longest known drainage path in the solar system. This system has been called the Uzboi-Landon-Morava (ULM) system.

Biography = Early life = Andersson began working in his teens in the Royal Mint. When he realised his passions lay with drawing, he enrolled in Technology school and passed with good qualifications. Design, however, did not interest him. His teacher, Kaleb Althin, encouraged him to take up caricaturing. = Turn to cartooning = At the age of twenty, Andersson debuted with his cartoons in the S√∂ndags-Nisse magazine, where he soon got employed. Inspired by the early comic artists from the United States and England in the late 19th century, Andersson created Sweden's first recurring comic strips: Br√∂derna Napoleon och Bartholomeus Lunds fr√•n Gr√∂nk√∂ping Resa Jorden Runt (about two brothers on a world tour), Mannen Som G√∂r Vad Som Faller Honom In (about a strange man who does whatever comes to his mind) and Urhunden (about a prehistoric dog and its owner), all around the turn of the century.Lambiek Comiclopedia entry Andersson was apparently friends with Swedish sculptor Carl Milles. = Suicide = In 1906, Oskar, who apparently suffered from long depressions and obsessive-compulsive disorder, committed suicide by shooting himself. The reasons for this are not entirely known, but Andersson was also known for his social anxiety, as well as incidents during his work as a reportage cartoonist, as he was exposed to severe mistreatment of military horses, which as an animal lover worsened his depression. Andersson is buried at Eker√∂ church cemetery.  Career  Andersson's best known strip, \\"Mannen som g√∂r vad som faller honom in\\" (The Man Who Does Whatever Comes To His Mind) was one of the first recurring comic strips in Swedish history. It was a 20-episode serial chronicling the misadventures of an anarchistic man who does whatever he wants, no matter how amoral it may be.A 1902 instalment of \\"Mannen som g√∂r vad som faller honom in\\", a cartoon by Oskar Andersson. = Other strips = Other cartooning works by Oskar Andersson include Urhunden, a strip about a prehistoric man and his pet dinosaur, and countless political satire cartoons. Among his contemporaries, Andersson was primarily known for his caricatures, which were published in Swedish newspapers S√∂ndags-Nisse and Strix, between 1897‚Äì1906.

Description It was the BBC's first attempt at a rock and roll programme, an innovation and much imitated, even today. It was called Six-Five Special because of the time it was broadcast ‚Äì it went out live at five past six on Saturday evening. It began immediately after the abolition of the Toddlers' Truce, which had seen television close between 6pm and 7pm so children could be put to bed. Jack Good was the original producer. Josephine Douglas and (initially) disc jockey Pete Murray were its presenters, with Murray using the catchphrase \\"Time to jive on the old six five\\". Its resident band was Don Lang and his Frantic Five. The show opened with film of a steam train accompanied by the programme's theme song, played and sung by the Bob Cort Skiffle Group, which began with the words \\"The Six-Five Special's comin' down the line, The Six-Five Special's right on time ...\\" BBC executives originally wanted a magazine format; however, Good wanted a show with music and much movement. The original sets were dispensed with and the empty studio space filled with the milling audience and performers. Television at that time was completely live as recording technology was limited, so once the programme started everything ran in an impromptu way. The running order was sketched out on Friday morning, and then only one complete run-through happened immediately before transmission on Saturday evening. The show was originally scheduled to last just six weeks but, as a result of its popularity, the series became open- ended. The BBC interfered with Good's vision of the show by including educational and information elements, which Good wanted to drop, as they diluted the music. The relationship between Good and the BBC became strained, and he resigned in early 1958.BFI article on Oh Boy! by Anthony Clark retrieved 9 December 2008 Good joined the ITV company ABC to create Oh Boy!, the show he'd wanted to make. It featured non-stop music and lost the public- service-inspired elements as part of its more frenzied pace, trouncing Six- Five Special in the ratings. The BBC, never keen on the show, took this as vindication and pulled it from the schedules. It was to be half a decade before Top of the Pops restored BBC coverage of contemporary popular music in general and \\"pop\\" in particular. Artists Among the artists on the show were Petula Clark, Jim Dale, Johnny Dankworth, Terry Dene, Lonnie Donegan, Russ Hamilton, Cleo Laine, Joan Regan, Finlay Currie, boxer Freddie Mills, Wee Willie Harris, Jimmy Lloyd, Marty Wilde, the Dallas Boys and Tommy Steele. Comedy performers included Trevor Peacock, who was also a script writer for the show, Spike Milligan and Bernie Winters. Film A spin-off film was released in 1958, scripted by Norman Hudis and directed by Alfred Shaughnessy. It centred around a young woman's quest for stardom - she was played by up- and-coming musical star Diane Todd. It featured performances from Lonnie Donegan, Dickie Valentine, Jim Dale, Petula Clark, Russ Hamilton and Joan Regan, among others, and featured comic relief from Mike and Bernie Winters.https://networkonair.com/all-products/2155-5-special-six-five-special- blu-ray-  See also  *American Bandstand, US show from same era *Juke Box Jury *Ready Steady Go! *The Tube *Later with Jools Holland References External links * Six Five Special at Whirligig TV. * (TV series) * (1958 Film) * Six-Five Special (1957‚Äì58) British Film Institute history * Six-Five Special MSN Movies entry * Billy Fury.com has a section on Jack Good and the making of the Six Five Special.

It is wide at the top and the base is . It lies in about of water. Around 4 million tons of rock were used in its construction in 1812 at the then-colossal cost of ¬£1.5 million (equivalent to ¬£ today). History In 1806, as the Napoleonic Wars impended, Lord St. Vincent commissioned John Rennie and Joseph Whidbey to plan a means of making Plymouth Bay a safe anchorage for the Channel Fleet. In 1811 came the order to begin construction; Whidbey was appointed Acting Superintending Engineer. This task required great engineering, organizational and political skills, as the many strictly technical challenges were complicated by the significant resources devoted to the project, from which various parties evidenced a desire for advantage. Nearly 4,000,000 (four million) tons of stone were quarried and transported, using about a dozen ships innovatively designed by the two engineers. A paper to the Royal Society suggests that Whidbey found many fossils as a result of the quarrying necessary to the breakwater. The foundation stone was laid on Shovel Rock on August 8, 1812. It followed a line over Panther Rock, Shovel and St. Carlos Rocks, and was sufficiently completed by 1814 to shelter ships of the line. Napoleon was reported as commenting that the breakwater was a grand thing, as he passed by it on the way to exile on St. Helena in 1815. Severe storm damage in 1817 and 1824 prompted a change in the profile and height. John Rennie died in 1821; his last work in connection with the breakwater was to draw up proposals for a lighthouse. Whidbey continued to work on the breakwater and other engineering projects, including the breakwater's lighthouse, until retirement around 1830; the work was completed by Rennie's sons, George and Sir John. =Plymouth Breakwater Lighthouse= Plymouth Breakwater Lighthouse stands on the western tip of the breakwater. Designed for the Admiralty by Walker & Burgess, construction of the granite tower began on 22 February 1841 and was completed on November 9th 1843; William Stuart was superintendent of the works. The light became operational in June 1844; soon afterwards a horse-drawn omnibus was driven along the breakwater from end to end, with a full complement of passengers accompanied by a military band.Plymouth Times, 27 July 1844 On completion, management of the light was transferred to Trinity House. A beacon was placed at the eastern end of the breakwater, consisting of a spherical cage on a pole; the cage was designed as a refuge for six shipwrecked sailors. The lighthouse had been provided with a second-order catadioptric lens array by Henry Lepaute of Paris; it showed a fixed red light with a white sector indicating an anchorage to the north-east (later the colours were reversed). Since 1854 a second white light has also been displayed, from a window lower down in the tower, indicating a channel between two hazards: the Draystone and the Knap; it used a small, sixth-order dioptric lens. By 1867 a 7 cwt bell had been installed at the lighthouse to serve as a fog signal. In 1879 a larger (32 cwt) bell was installed, and the old bell was transferred to Gunfleet Lighthouse. (The new bell had previously been in use at Start Point lighthouse, where a fog siren had replaced it two years earlier). The bell sounded four strokes every minute in foggy weather. The following year, the light was made occulting (being eclipsed for three seconds every half minute).London Gazette, Issue 24871, Page 4322, 6 August 1880 In 1920 the lighthouse was converted to run automatically on acetylene gas. Following departure of the resident keepers, the light was monitored from the Trinity House fog signal station at nearby Penlee Point. Oversight of the lighthouse was passed from Trinity House to the Ministry of Defence in 1993. The bell remained in use until 1994, when it was replaced by an electronic fog horn. The main light currently flashes once every ten seconds, white with a red sector to the north-east; the subsidiary white light has an isophase characteristic, two seconds on, two seconds off. = Plymouth Breakwater Fort = Plymouth Breakwater Fort from inside the Sound In 1860, a Royal Commission, established by Lord Palmerston, produced a plan for the defence of Plymouth and other Royal Dockyards. The Breakwater Fort was designed to defend the entrances to Plymouth Sound in conjunction with forts and batteries on either shore. Designed by Captain Siborne, work on the oval masonry sea fort started in 1861 and the main structure was completed in 1865. It has its foundations on Shovel Rock and is 35 yards inside the Breakwater. After several changes in plan, the fort was finally armed in 1879 with fourteen 12.5-inch and four 10-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns in armoured casemates. Although the fort had been disarmed before World War I, it served as a signal station, and from 1937, an anti-aircraft training school. It was finally released by the military in 1976.

He ranks amongst the top 6% of SSRN Top Economics authors. With a wide range of interests focused around exchange rates through to macroeconomics and international finance, he has published over 130 articles in peer-reviewed journals and authored or edited over 15 books. He has over 18,000 citations to his work recorded on Google Scholar  Fellowships and grants  MacDonald is an International Fellow at the Kiel Institute of Economics, and Research Fellow of the CESifo Research Network Munich and was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 2002 to 2014. Since 1996 he has been involved in successful Research Grant applications totalling over ¬£2,000,000.  Academic research  = Current research = MacDonald's current research interests span a range of topics in Macroeconomics (i.e. optimal monetary policy and the monetary transmission process; the role of FDIs, exchange rate misalignment, capital flows and corruption on economic growth; the sustainability of fiscal policy), International Finance (i.e. the determination of exchange rates and exchange rate forecasting; equilibrium exchange rate issues) and Finance (i.e. the determination of stock and bond prices and the term structure of interest rates). = The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate Model = MacDonald's research on exchange rate modelling has been highly influential with many implications for policy-markers. The Behavioural Equilibrium Exchange Rate (BEER), developed jointly with Peter Clark at the International Monetary Fund, has been widely applied by central banks and financial researchers to assess the extent of mis-alignment between major world currencies. In terms of policy-based research, he has proposed phasing out the Barnett Formula in favour of fiscal autonomy in the Scottish Parliament.  Non-academic positions  As a prominent figure in economic academia, MacDonald has held posts as Consultant Researcher and Visiting Scholar at the International Monetary Fund on fourteen separate occasions, and has presented five-day courses on the 'Economics of Exchange Rates' at the International Monetary Fund Institute. He has furthermore acted as consultant to a wide range of Central Banks, International Banks, and other financial institutions and private sector industry, including European Commission and the European Central Bank. MacDonald has also served as a member of the executive committee of the Scottish Doctoral Programme, Member of Council of the Scottish Economic Society, and was one of the founding directors (in macroeconomics) of the Scottish Institute for Research in Economics (SIRE), which resulted in a significant funding uplift for economics in Scotland from the Scottish Funding Council. He has acted as an expert witness to various committees of the Scottish Parliament, the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee and the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee.

Professional wrestling career Tomko started out as a wrestler in his hometown of Winnipeg on July 9, 1954, with the Madison Wrestling Club, losing his debut match to John DePaulo. During that same period, he ran his own promotion in Winnipeg, the Olympia Wrestling Club. After he shut down the Olympia Club to pursue non- wrestling ventures, but he rejoined the larger Madison Club in the 1960s to become one of that promotion's top heels. He bought the Madison Club in 1967 and merged it with the American Wrestling Association in 1968. Tomko acted as the AWA's Winnipeg promoter from 1966 through to the mid-1970s, and he was credited with launching the career of Roddy Piper. He also competed sometimes in Stampede Wrestling under a mask as Cosmo #1, and later wrestled without the mask in Stampede and in Vancouver's NWA All Star Wrestling as \\"Crazy Legs\\" Leroy Hirsch. In 1972, he started up another independent promotion called Central Canadian Championship Wrestling, which he ran in Manitoba cities and towns outside Winnipeg. He made use of mostly local talent, although he occasionally also brought in big-name stars for special appearances. Tomko later left Winnipeg and headed to Vancouver, where he bought Sandor Kovacs' ownership stake in NWA All Star in 1977. While promoting the Vancouver territory, he began pushing himself as All Star's top star under the ring name Master Sergeant Tomko in the early-1980s (despite his age, being physically past his prime, and lacking wrestling skills) and gave himself almost all of All Star's championships (including the Vancouver version of the NWA Canadian Heavyweight title) at various points. Under Tomko's leadership, All Star went into decline (with co-owner Gene Kiniski selling his share of the company in 1985) and went out of business by 1989. Personal life His two sons were Todd (who wrestled under the ring name Rick Davis) and Terry (who competed as The Frog, first while wearing a mask, and later unmasked). On August 5, 2009, Tomko died, aged 77, after a two-month bout with pancreatic cancer.

The ergastulum was usually built as a deep, roofed pit below ground level, large enough to allow the slaves to work within it, and containing narrow spaces in which they slept. Ergastula were common structures on all slave-using farms (latifundia). The etymology is disputed between two possible Greek roots: ergasterios \\"workshop\\" and ergastylos \\"pillar to which slaves are tethered.\\" The ergastulum was made illegal during the reign of Hadrian as part of a series of reforms to improve conditions for slaves. Columella in his Res Rustica states that an underground ergastulum should be as healthful as possible and lit by windows with narrow bars, which are far enough from the ground that it is not possible to reach them by hand. In the Loeb Classical Library 1941 edition H. B. Ash translates a later section in Book 1, Chapter 8 of the Res Rustica as: \\"Again, it is the established custom of all men of caution to inspect the inmates of the workhouse [ergastuli], to find out whether they are carefully chained, whether the places of confinement are quite safe and properly guarded, whether the overseer has put anyone in fetters or removed his shackles without the master's knowledge.\\" Ash translates the term ergastulis as \\"chain-gangs\\" upon its first appearance in the Res Rustica in Book 1, Chapter 3.

The historical Parit Sulong Bridge constructed during World War II is a main feature in that town. The first large massacre of 161 Australian troops by Japanese forces occurred at Parit Sulong on the west coast of Malaya on 22 January 1942. Wounded survivors from the battle of Muar who could not travel on foot were left at Parit Sulong when the remnants of the greatly outnumbered force of Australians and Indians escaped from the Japanese who surrounded them. The Japanese soldiers are said to have kicked and hit the prisoners with rifle butts. They forced them into an overcrowded shed and denied them food, water and medical attention. At sunset, those able to walk were roped or wired together and were led away. The Japanese collected petrol from the Allied vehicles which had been left stranded, shot and bayoneted their prisoners, threw petrol upon them and ignited it.

Lear wrote the poem for a three-year-old girl, Janet Symonds, the daughter of Lear's friend poet John Addington Symonds and his wife Catherine Symonds. The term \\"runcible\\", used for the phrase \\"runcible spoon\\", was invented for the poem.  Synopsis  \\"The Owl and the Pussy-cat\\" features four anthropomorphic animals ‚Äì an owl, a cat, a pig, and a turkey ‚Äì and tells the story of the love between the title characters who marry in the land \\"where the Bong-tree grows\\". The Owl and the Pussy-cat set out to sea in a pea green boat with honey and \\"plenty of money\\" wrapped in a five-pound note. The Owl serenades the Pussy-cat while gazing at the stars and strumming on a small guitar. The Owl describes the Pussy-cat as beautiful. The Pussy-cat responds by describing the Owl as an \\"elegant fowl\\" and compliments the bird's singing. The Pussy-cat urges that they marry; however, they do not have a ring. They sail away for a year and a day to a land where bong trees grow and discover a pig with a ring in his nose in a wood. They buy the ring for a shilling and are married the next day by a turkey. They dine on mince and quince using a \\"runcible spoon\\", then dance hand-in-hand on the sand in the moonlight. Unfinished sequel Portions of an unfinished sequel, \\"The Children of the Owl and the Pussy-cat\\" were published first posthumously, during 1938. The children are part fowl and part cat, and love to eat mice. The family live by places with strange names. The Cat dies, falling from a tall tree, making the Owl become a single parent. The death causes the Owl great sadness. The money is all spent, but the Owl still sings to the original guitar.  Media  The \\"piggy-wig\\" in the land of Bong- trees * Beatrix Potter wrote a prequel, The Tale of Little Pig Robinson, telling the background story of the pig character. *The story has been set to music and animated many times, such as by: **Igor Stravinsky in 1966, using twelve-tone technique; a recording was made under the composer's supervision for Columbia Records **Victor Hely-Hutchinson **Burl Ives **Hugh \\"Lumpy\\" Brannum, aka Mr. Greenjeans; which appeared on a special anthology of children's songs put out by Columbia Records, entitled: Greatest Hits For the Children You Love **Humphrey Searle in 1951, using twelve-tone technique for the accompanying flute, guitar, and cello, but sprechgesang for the vocal part. **Laurie Anderson composed \\"Beautiful Pea Green Boat\\" and recorded it on her 1994 album Bright Red. **Terrytoons adapted the poem in animation twice with a black-and-white version in 1934 and a color version in 1939. The 1939 version had the first appearance of Sourpuss who was later paired with Gandy Goose. **John Rutter set the lyrics for choir a cappella in the collection Five Childhood Lyrics, first performed in 1973. ** Elton Hayes made a recording of the Hely-Hutchinson setting for Parlophone. during 1953. It became a regular item on the radio programme Children's Favourites and was one of six Edward Lear recordings he made. ** Dave Benson Phillips sang the first verse of the poem set to music, accompanied with the words being signed in Makaton sign language on the video Makaton Nursery Rhymes * In the book Explorers on the Moon, the seventeenth volume of The Adventures of Tintin, first published in 1959, Captain Haddock is shown to be singing a slightly modified version of the last line of this poem, replacing Moon with Earth (sic: \\"And they danced by the light of the Earth\\"). * The 1965 film Fun in Balloon Land contains references to the poem, and refers to the Turkey as \\"The Marrying Turkey\\". * It was the main topic of The Owl and the Pussycat Went to See..., a 1968 children's musical play about Lear's nonsense poems. The play was written by Sheila Ruskin and David Wood. * The title was borrowed for an unrelated stage play written by Bill Manhoff, first produced on Broadway in 1964, and the subsequent 1970 movie, featuring Barbra Streisand and George Segal. * During 1971, a cartoon based on the poem was made by Weston Woods. * In Walt Disney's 1968 animated featurette Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day, later a part of 1977's The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, the character Owl mentions a relative of his who supposedly \\"went to sea in a pea- green boat\\" with a Pussy-cat. * In the Amazing Animals episode Nighttime Animals, Henry the Lizard mentions this poem in his report. * In 1998, Roscoe Lee Browne performed a recording of this poem on Creative Records. * In 1998, Naxos Records produced album \\"Seven Ages: An Anthology of Poetry with Music\\" which contains a recording of John Cleese reading The Owl and the Pussycat on track 15. * Composer Deborah Kavasch of the Extended Vocal Techniques Ensemble (established at the University of California, San Diego, 1972) composed The Owl and the Pussycat, a setting of the poem, for the ensemble. It was published in 1980 by Edition Reimers. * In Part One of the 1993 movie Dandelion Dead, the poem is recited by the children before they go to bed. * Eric Idle, a former member of Monty Python, wrote a children's book The Quite Remarkable Adventures of the Owl and the Pussycat based on the poem. In this extended story, the pair are attacked by a band of ruthless rats who were trying to steal pies. The book was illustrated by Wesla Weller and was first published during 1996 with an audio version which included some songs by Idle himself. * In The Roald Dahl Treasury has an alternate version of the poem in which the Pussycat rejects the Owl after he offers her gin and caviar, instead wishing for a nice Tomcat. * Between 2001 and 2003, Stewart Lee wrote and performed a show, Pea Green Boat, which includes an extended version of the story of \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\" as well as the original poem. A 21-minute version of the show has been made available commercially. * In 2004, the folk duo Sandwich (Buddy Freebury and Andrea Hallier) recorded a musical version of the poem to a tune written by band member Andrea (Hallier) Freebury. It was recorded on their third album, Crystal Ball. * Sananda Maitreya's sixth album, Angels & Vampires ‚Äì Volume II, includes a track, \\"The Owl and the Pussycat\\". * A deleted scene intended for the episode \\"Quagmire's Baby\\" of the animated comedy TV show Family Guy involves Glenn Quagmire reading the poem to his daughter, but he becomes aroused by the sexual nature of the story. *In 2013, Julia Donaldson and Charlotte Voake published The Further Adventures of the Owl and the Pussycat, a sequel to Lear's poem. *In 2015, Kate Ceberano performed the poem as a song on her album, Lullaby.

The sea breeze occurs because of the major temperature difference between the land and sea. The name was in use as early as the 1870s and was similar to equivalent terms for winds that occurred in South Africa and the West Indies.Christensen, Joseph (2009)Fremantle Doctor page 389 of General trend During summer months, the Fremantle Doctor consistently blows from the southwest along the southern half of the west coast, starting between 10 am and 3 pm. It can penetrate as far inland as , reaching York in the early evening. In Perth, the capital city of Western Australia, the wind is named the Fremantle Doctor because it appears to come from the nearby coastal city of Fremantle, and it brings welcome relief from the summertime high temperatures. The Fremantle Doctor often cools the Perth suburbs by several degrees, whilst nearer the coast the wind can be quite strong, often blowing between 15 and 20 knots and making afternoon beach visits unpleasant. On days when the wind fails, the afternoon temperatures of Perth suburbs are considerably higher, often exceeding , although this is also attributable to the influence of a strong easterly wind blowing in hot desert air from the arid interior of the state. Further analysis The Fremantle Doctor is strongest in December and January, when the temperature differential between the land and ocean is greatest. In February and March the breeze is not as strong, because the ocean is a bit warmer. Though October and November are not as warm, the ocean is cooler, resulting in the sea breeze in these months. Other months have a weak or non-existent Fremantle Doctor. In the winter months, the land is usually cooler than the ocean, and this sometimes results in the weaker land breeze in the early morning. When the Fremantle Doctor first arrives it is from the west-south-west direction. Later when it is at maximum strength, the direction is usually from the southwest or south-south- west. By the early evening, the direction is from the south. This change in wind direction is due to the Coriolis Effect. Other factors, like the prevailing wind of a particular day, can also have an effect on the direction.

They were formed in 1991 under the name Nembrionic Hammerdeath as a black metal band; they changed their name to Nembrionic in 1993. The band released three albums on Displeased Records and another together with Osdorp Posse. They split up in 1999. Biography The band started in April 1991, influenced by Venom, Possessed, and Terrorizer, and recorded a demo in that same year. Their 1992 EP sold 1800 copies and garnered the band a record deal with Dutch metal label Displeased Records. They moved toward grindcore and death metal on Tempter, a split with Consolation. The band played about 30 shows to promote the album and went on tour with At the Gates and Consolation. Hammerdeath was dropped from the name in 1995, and their next album, Psycho One Hundred, led to shows at open air festivals such as Liberation Day, Mundial, and Lowlands, and even a show in Rotterdam Ahoy. In 1996, they joined with Osdorp Posse to record Briljant, Hard en Geslepen, which charted in the Netherlands. Nembrionic played at Dynamo Open Air and Pinkpop Festival, and even opened for Slayer in Paradiso, June 1996.

Aryaman is commonly invoked together with Varuna-Mitra, Bhaga, B·πõhaspati, and other Adityas and Asuras.

He was a Labor Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1996 to 2006, representing the rural electorate of Stuart. He served as Attorney-General under Chief Minister Clare Martin, and for some years was occasionally tipped as a potential successor to Martin. He resigned from the ministry and from parliament in August 2006, citing health reasons. Toyne was born and raised in Victoria. He initially spent time as a professional athlete, twice coming third in the Stawell Gift, winning five Victorian championships over 400 and 800 metres, and breaking world records over 550 metres and 600 yards. However, he later studied science and education at the University of Melbourne with the intent of becoming a teacher. He graduated in 1972, and spent several years teaching at Flemington High School. In 1975, Toyne founded the Kensington Community School, and spent four years working on the project. Toyne left the Melbourne school in 1980, and not long after, relocated across the country to the Northern Territory. He took a particular interest in community education projects aimed at the indigenous community of the Territory, developing several programs and serving stints as both a teacher and an administrator. Toyne also worked as a consultant to the Perron government from 1990 to 1994. Toyne began to take an interest in a political career, and when Labor Party Opposition Leader Brian Ede resigned from parliament in mid-1996, Toyne nominated to replace him as the ALP candidate for Stuart at the subsequent by-election. The campaign was a particularly close one, but Toyne was ultimately successful, defeating Country Liberal Party candidate Tony Bohning by only 72 votes. Having been elected, Toyne began serving as an opposition backbencher, and managed to survive another challenge from Bohning at the 1997 election, which was won by only 70 votes. Two years later, Toyne was appointed as the party whip when Clare Martin's ascendancy to the leadership sparked a cabinet reshuffle. By this point, Toyne was becoming an increasingly prominent figure in Northern Territory politics, and at the 2001 election, was easily re-elected, winning more than 70% of the vote. When that same election saw the ALP win their first victory in the history of the Assembly, new Chief Minister Clare Martin appointed Toyne to the ministry, most notably as Attorney-General. Toyne received a further promotion when unpopular Health Minister Jane Aagaard was dumped in October 2003, and he was called upon as her replacement. Though he had publicly speculated about resigning at the 2005 election, he later announced that he would indeed re-contest the seat after being rebuked by Martin, and was easily re-elected for a third full term. Barely a year after being re-elected, on 29 August 2006, Toyne suddenly resigned from both the ministry and from parliament, citing an unspecified medical condition. A by-election was held, with Labor candidate Karl Hampton successful.

There are five design elements, three hearts which also form the bowl and the ring of the spoon. Between these are a wheel and a padlock. A lovespoon is a wooden spoon decoratively carved that was traditionally presented as a gift of romantic intent. The spoon is normally decorated with symbols of love, and was intended to reflect the skill of the carver. Due to the intricate designs, lovespoons are no longer used as functioning spoons and are now decorative craft items. Origins The lovespoon is a traditional craft that dates back to the seventeenth century. Over generations, decorative carvings were added to the spoon and it lost its original practical use and became a treasured decorative item to be hung on a wall. The earliest known dated lovespoon from Wales, displayed in the St Fagans National History Museum near Cardiff, is from 1667, although the tradition is believed to date back long before that. The earliest dated lovespoon worldwide originates from Germany, and is dated as 1664. Symbols The lovespoon was given to a young woman by her suitor. It was important for the girl's father to see that the young man was capable of providing for the family and woodworking. Sailors would often carve lovespoons during their long journeys, which is why anchors would often be incorporated into the carvings. Certain symbols came to have specific meanings: a horseshoe for luck, a cross for faith, bells for marriage, hearts for love, a wheel supporting a loved one and a lock for security, among others. Caged balls indicated the number of children hoped for. Other difficult carvings, such as chains, were as much a demonstration of the carver's skill as a symbolic meaning.Symbols & Meanings of Welsh love Spoons Although the Welsh lovespoon is the most famous there are also traditions of lovespoons in ScandinaviaSwedish Courting Spoons and some parts of Eastern Europe, which have their own unique styles and techniques when it comes to the Lovespoon. Today lovespoons are given as wedding and anniversary gifts, as well as birthday, baby gifts, Christmas or Valentine's Day gifts. They are now mostly seen as a folk craft.  Wedding spoons  Norwegian carving-style wedding spoons In old times, newly married couples in Norway ate with linked spoons to symbolize the linkage of their marriage. Often the spoons and chain were made from a single piece of wood, emphasizing wood-carving craftsmanship. Similar linked spoons can be found in some ethnographic museums. A design for making linked spoons was published in Popular Science in 1967.  See also  * Wooden spoon * Treen References  Further reading  * H.E.Roese (2017).

Fishbein is vilified in the chiropractic community due to his principal role in founding and propagating the campaign to suppress and end chiropractic as a profession due to its basis in pseudoscientific practices.Donahue, (1996), 16(1):39-49. Biography He was born in St. Louis, Missouri on July 22, 1889, son of an immigrant Jewish peddlar who moved his family to Indianapolis. He studied at Rush Medical College where he graduated in 1913. Fishbein served for 18 months as a resident physician at the Durand Hospital for Infectious Diseases. He joined George H. Simmons, editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), as an assistant and advanced to the editorship in 1924, a position he maintained until 1950. He was on the cover of Time on June 21, 1937. In 1938, along with the AMA, he was indicted for violating the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The AMA was convicted and fined $2,500 but Fishbein was acquitted. In 1961 he became the founding Editor of Medical World News, a magazine for doctors. In 1970 he endowed the Morris Fishbein Center for the study of the history of science and medicine at the University of Chicago. Its first activity was a lecture series taking place in May of that year. Allen G. Debus served as director of the Center from 1971 to 1977. Fishbein also endowed a chair at the university for the same subject, a chair taken up by Debus in 1978. The 7th floor in Shoreland Hall at the University of Chicago was known as Fishbein House, using the Fishbein name as its namesake. He died on September 27, 1976 in Chicago, Illinois. He was survived by two daughters, Barbara Fishbein Friedell and Marjorie Clavey, and his son, Justin M. Fishbein. Quacks He was also notable due to his affinity for exposing quacks, notably the goat-gland surgeon John R. Brinkley, and campaigning for regulation of medical devices. His book Fads and Quackery in Healing debunks homeopathy, osteopathy, chiropractic, Christian Science, radionics and other dubious medical practices.Tobey, James A. (1933). Fads and Quackery in Healing. American Journal of Public Health and the Nation's Health 23 (3): 295‚Äì296. In 1938, Fishbein authored a two-part article \\"Modern Medical Charlatans\\" in the journal Hygeia which criticized the quackery of Brinkley.\\"The Case of Brinkley Vs. Fishbein: Proceedings of a Libel Suit Based on an Article Published in Hygeia\\". JAMA (journal). Brinkley sued Fishbein for libel but lost the case.Lee, Alton R. (2002). The Bizarre Careers of John R. Brinkley. University of Kentucky Press. pp. 211-218. The jury found that Brinkley \\"should be considered a charlatan and a quack in the ordinary, well-understood meaning of those words.\\" Fishbein responded that \\"the decision is a great victory for honest scientific medicine, for the standards of education and conduct established by the American Medical Association.\\" Fishbein was critical of the activities of Mary Baker Eddy. He considered her a fraud and plagiarist.Hudson, Robert P. (1983). Disease and Its Control: The Shaping of Modern Thought. Greenwood Press. p. 70.

Traditionally, these objectives have been accomplished either by a party convention, a vote of members of parliament, or some form of electoral college. OMOV backers claim that OMOV enhances the practice of democracy, because ordinary citizens will be able to participate. Detractors counter that allowing those unversed in the issues to help make decisions makes for bad governance.  Canada  The first OMOV leadership selection process in Canada was held by the Parti Qu√©b√©cois, ending on 29 September 1985. In English-speaking Canada, the principle of OMOV has for years been a major commitment of Vaughan L. Baird. Long a proponent of the election process that empowers all members of a party to choose their leaders, Baird was instrumental in having the provincial constituency of Morris, Manitoba successfully put forward the principle of OMOV to the provincial Progressive Conservative Party on 5 November 1985. Immediately after the Morris victory, Baird wrote to every national and provincial party in Canada and urged them to do the same. Soon after, the Manitoba Liberal Party adopted the principle. Alberta PCs used the method in electing Ralph Klein as their new leader in December 1992. The Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba adopted the process in early 1987, but the party hierarchy later had it revoked. Though again adopted by the party in 1994, OMOV was revoked a second time in November 1995. Finally, on November 17, 2001, with only three votes in opposition, OMOV was passed by the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba. Also in 1995, the New Democratic Party moved some way towards OMOV when they developed a series of regional primary elections prior to their convention. In the subsequent contest, the party went further adopting a modified OMOV process for the 2003 NDP leadership election in which the vote was calculated so that ballots cast by labour delegates had 25% weight in the total result, while votes cast by all party members on an OMOV had a weight of 75%. When the federal Liberal government changed the election finances law, soon after Jack Layton won the NDP's leadership in the modified OMOV election on January 23, 2003, the party implemented full OMOV for its next leadership convention. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois first used OMOV in its 1997 leadership election. In 1991, the Alberta Progressive Conservatives changed its rules for selecting a party leader, moving from a traditional delegate-based leadership convention to an OMOV system.Ted Morton, Leadership Selection in Alberta, 1992-2011: A Personal Perspective, Canadian Parliamentary Review Vol. 36, number 2 (2013). Four party leaders were chosen using this system: Ralph Klein (1992); Ed Stelmach (2006); Alison Redford (2011); and Jim Prentice (2014).Barry Cooper, Do Alberta's Progressive Conservatives have a death wish?, Troy Media (November 11, 2016). However, the Alberta PC party ended this system in 2016 after OMOV came under criticism.Michelle Bellefontaine, Alberta PC party ends one member, one vote system to choose leaders, CBC News (May 7, 2016). The Conservative Party of Canada uses a weighted OMOV system in which all ridings are accorded an equal number of points and those points are distributed to candidates proportionately to how party members in that riding vote. The Canadian Alliance used a pure OMOV system but in merger negotiations with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada it was agreed to adopt the weighted system used in the 1998 Progressive Conservative leadership election in order to encourage leadership candidates to seek support across the country. In 2009, the Liberal Party of Canada adopted a weighted membership vote in which each riding counts equally in the final tally. This is not a one-member, one vote system because, by definition, members have a variable number of votes depending on the riding they live in. However, it is similar to one member, one vote in that every party member is entitled to cast a ballot. The 2009 convention was conducted according to the old rules. However, as this convention did not feature a contested race but was a ratification of Michael Ignatieff's leadership, the last example of a full-blown delegated federal leadership convention being the 2006 convention that elected St√©phane Dion.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, the methods of selecting party leaders gradually developed as parliamentary parties took shape and grew more rigid over time, in some cases many decades after their counterparts elsewhere in the Commonwealth ‚Äì for example, the Conservative Party did not adopt a formal method for choosing its leaders until 1965. Traditionally, members of Parliament have usually played a major role in selecting a party leaders, based largely on the belief that since a leader had to work closely with his or her parliamentary party, their views on who the leader should be had to be paramount. In recent years, all major parties have implemented reforms to allow ordinary party members a say in the choosing of a new leader, while still allowing MPs a central role in the leadership selection process.Thomas Quinn, Electing and Ejecting Party Leaders in Britain (Palgrave Macmillan UK, 2012). =Liberal Democrats= The Liberal Democrats are the most longstanding example of a national UK party using the one-member, one-vote voting system. It has been used since the party's foundation in 1988. Rather than having a 'runoff', the Liberal Democrats use the Alternative Vote system of preference voting. Liberal Democrat MPs have no special voting rights when choosing the leader ‚Äì however, a prospective candidate must be a sitting Liberal Democrat MP with the support of at least ten percent of the parliamentary party in order to stand in a leadership election. =Labour= Until 1981, the Labour Party leader was chosen by a secret ballot of Labour MPs. One-member, one-vote for the election of the party's leader was first proposed at Labour's Wembley Special Conference in 1981, but was opposed by Tony Benn, who instead initiated an electoral college comprising different interest groups in the party: a trade union section comprising 40% of the total vote, consisting of block votes cast by union General Secretaries, another section of 30% comprising the Parliamentary Labour Party (Labour MPs) and a further 30% for active party members in Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs). Party leader Neil Kinnock attempted, but failed, to introduce one-member, one-vote in 1984. His successor, John Smith partially introduced a new one-member, one-vote system by abolishing the trade union block vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates, and by giving union members paying the political levy (in the trade union section of Labour's electoral college) a direct vote in the party's leadership elections. He introduced the change at the Labour Party Conference in 1993, and was verbally supported in winning votes for it at the Conference by then-Shadow Cabinet member John Prescott. A complete one- member, one-vote voting system (as originally proposed by both Neil Kinnock and John Smith) was introduced in 2014 by Labour leader Ed Miliband.John Rentoul, Tony Blair: Prime Minister (2001) pp 206-18 All Labour Party members are now entitled to vote for the Leader and Deputy Leader of the party as part of an electoral college which includes MPs, members of the European Parliament and trade unions. =Conservatives= In January 1998, the one member, one vote principle was adopted as part of the series of reforms of the Conservative Party. MPs choose two candidates to go to a vote by all Conservative members. The system was first used by the Conservatives in the 2001 leadership election to replace William Hague. A run off by various candidates led to Iain Duncan Smith and Kenneth Clarke being put forward to a vote of all Conservative members, where 79% of the 328,000 eligible members voted. Duncan Smith became the new Leader of the Conservative Party with 61% of the votes (155,933 votes). Kenneth Clarke obtained 39% of the votes (100,544 votes). In the 2003 leadership election no ballot took place, since Michael Howard was unopposed in standing to replace Duncan Smith. The two candidate run off was employed again two years later, when David Cameron was chosen by the Conservative members as their new leader over David Davis. Cameron had 134,446 votes compared to Davis‚Äô 64,398 votes, making a total number of 198,844 votes.

One man, one vote (or one person, one vote) expresses the principle that individuals should have equal representation in voting. This slogan is used by advocates of political equality to refer to such electoral reforms as universal suffrage, proportional representation, and the elimination of plural voting, malapportionment, or gerrymandering. The British trade unionist George Howell used the phrase \\"one man, one vote\\" in political pamphlets in 1880.George Howell (1880). \\"One man, one vote\\". Manchester Selected Pamphlets. During the 20th-century period of decolonisation and the struggles for national sovereignty, from the late 1940s onwards, this phrase became widely used in developing countries where majority populations sought to gain political power in proportion to their numbers. The slogan was notably used by the anti-apartheid movement during the 1980s, which sought to end white minority rule in South Africa. In the United States, the \\"one person, one vote\\" principle was invoked in a series of cases by the Warren Court in the 1960s, during the height of related civil rights activities.Richard H. Fallon, Jr. (2013). The Dynamic Constitution. Cambridge University Press, 196.Douglas J. Smith (2014). On Democracy's Doorstep: The Inside Story of How the Supreme Court Brought \\"One Person, One Vote\\" to the United States. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.\\"One person, one vote\\", in David Andrew Schultz (2010). Encyclopedia of the United States Constitution. Infobase Publishing, 526. Applying the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court majority opinion (5‚Äì4) led by Chief Justice Earl Warren in Reynolds v. Sims (1964) ruled that state legislatures, unlike the United States Congress, needed to have representation in both houses that was based on districts containing roughly equal populations, with redistricting as needed after censuses. Some had an upper house based on an equal number of representatives to be elected from each county, which gave undue political power to rural counties. Many states had neglected to redistrict for decades during the 20th century, even as population increased in urban, industrialized areas. In addition, the court ruled in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964) that states must also draw federal congressional districts containing roughly equal represented populations. United Kingdom = Historical background = This phrase was traditionally used in the context of demands for suffrage reform. Historically the emphasis within the House of Commons was on representing areas: counties, boroughs and, later on, universities. The entitlement to vote for the Members of Parliament representing the constituencies varied widely, with different qualifications over time, such as owning property of a certain value, holding an apprenticeship, qualifying for paying the local-government rates, or holding a degree from the university in question. Those who qualified for the vote in more than one constituency were entitled to vote in each constituency, while many adults did not qualify for the vote at all. Plural voting was also present in local government, whereby the owners of business property qualified for votes in the relevant wards. Reformers argued that Members of Parliament and other elected officials should represent citizens equally, and that each voter should be entitled to exercise the vote once in an election. Successive Reform Acts by 1950 had both extended the franchise eventually to almost all adult citizens (barring convicts, lunatics and members of the House of Lords), and also reduced and finally eliminated plural voting for Westminster elections. Plural voting for local-government elections outside the City of London was not abolished until the Representation of the People Act 1969. But, there were two significant exceptions: =City of London= The City of London had never expanded its boundaries. Following the replacement of many residential dwellings by businesses, and the destruction of The Blitz, after the Second World War, the financial district had barely five thousand residents. The system of plural voting was retained for electing the City of London Corporation, with some modifications. =Northern Ireland= When Northern Ireland was established in 1921, it adopted the same political system then in place for the Westminster Parliament and British local government. But the Parliament of Northern Ireland did not follow Westminster in changes to the franchise from 1945. As a result, into the 1960s, plural voting was still allowed not only for local government (as it was for local government in Great Britain), but also for the Parliament of Northern Ireland. This meant that in local council elections (as in Great Britain), ratepayers and their spouses, whether renting or owning the property, could vote. Company directors had an extra vote by virtue of their company's status. However, unlike the situation in Great Britain, non-ratepayers did not have a vote in local government elections. The franchise for elections to the Parliament of Northern Ireland had been extended in 1928 to all adult citizens who were not disqualified, at the same time as the franchise for elections to Westminster. But, university representation and the business vote continued for elections to the Assembly until 1969. They were abolished in 1948 for elections to Parliament (including Parliament seats in Northern Ireland). Historians and political scholars have debated the extent to which the franchise for local government contributed to unionist electoral success in controlling councils in nationalist-majority areas. Based on a number of inequities, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association was founded in 1967. It had five primary demands, and added the demand that each citizen in Northern Ireland be afforded the same number of votes for local government elections (as stated above, this was not yet the case anywhere in the United Kingdom). The slogan \\"one man, one vote\\" became a rallying cry for this campaign. The Parliament of Northern Ireland voted to update the voting rules for elections to the Assembly, which were implemented for the 1969 Northern Ireland general election, and for local government elections, which was done by the Electoral Law Act (Northern Ireland) 1969, passed on 25 November 1969. United States =Historical background= \\"One man, one vote\\" emblem (Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC - New Jersey) The United States Constitution requires a decennial census for the purpose of assuring fair apportionment of seats in the United States House of Representatives among the states, based on their population. Reapportionment has generally been conducted without incident with the exception of the reapportionment that should have followed the 1920 Census, which was effectively skipped pending resolution by the Reapportionment Act of 1929. State legislatures, however, initially established election of congressional representatives from districts that were often based on traditional counties or parishes that had preceded founding of the new government. The question then arose as to whether the legislatures were required to ensure that House districts were roughly equal in population and to draw new districts to accommodate demographic changes. Some U.S. states redrew their House districts every ten years to reflect changes in population patterns; many did not. Some never redrew them, except when it was mandated by reapportionment of Congress and a resulting change in the number of seats to which that state was entitled in the House of Representatives. In many states, both North and South, this inaction resulted in a skewing of influence for voters in some districts over those in others, generally with a bias toward rural districts. For example, if the 2nd congressional district eventually had a population of 1.5 million, but the 3rd had only 500,000, then, in effect ‚Äì since each district elected the same number of representatives ‚Äì a voter in the 3rd district had three times the voting \\"power\\" of a 2nd-district voter. Alabama's state legislature resisted redistricting from 1910 to 1972 (when forced by federal court order). As a result, rural residents retained a wildly disproportionate amount of power in a time when other areas of the state became urbanized and industrialized, attracting greater populations. Such urban areas were under- represented in the state legislature and underserved; their residents had difficulty getting needed funding for infrastructure and services. Such areas paid far more in taxes to the state than they received in benefits in relation to the population.Charlie B. Tyler, \\"County Government in the Palmetto State\\", University of South Carolina, 1998, p. 221 The Constitution incorporates the result of the Great Compromise, which established representation for the U.S. Senate. Each state was equally represented in the Senate with two representatives, without regard to population. The Founding Fathers considered this principle of such importance that they included a clause in the Constitution to prohibit any state from being deprived of equal representation in the Senate without its permission; see Article V of the United States Constitution. For this reason, \\"one person, one vote\\" has never been implemented in the U.S. Senate, in terms of representation by states. When states established their legislatures, they often adopted a bicameral model based on colonial governments or the federal government. Many copied the Senate principle, establishing an upper house based on geography - for instance, a state senate with one representative drawn from each county. By the 20th century, this often resulted in state senators having widely varying amounts of political power, with ones from rural areas having votes equal in power to those of senators representing much greater urban populations. Activism in the Civil Rights Movement to restore the ability of African Americans in the South to register and vote highlighted other voting inequities across the country. In 1964‚Äì1965, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 were passed, in part to enforce the constitutional voting rights of African Americans. Numerous court challenges were raised, including in Alabama, due to the lack of reapportionment for decades. = Court cases = In the United States Supreme Court held in a 4-3 plurality decision that Article I, Section 4 left to the legislature of each state the authority to establish the time, place, and manner of holding elections for representatives. However, in the United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren overturned the previous decision in Colegrove holding that malapportionment claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment were not exempt from judicial review under Article IV, Section 4, as the equal protection issue in this case was separate from any political questions.Stephen Ansolabehere, James M. Snyder (2008). The End of Inequality: One Person, One Vote and the Transformation of American Politics. Norton. The \\"one person, one vote\\" doctrine, which requires electoral districts to be apportioned according to population, thus making each district roughly equal in population, was further affirmed by the Warren Court in the landmark cases that followed Baker, including , which concerned the County Unit System in Georgia; which concerned state legislature districts; , which concerned U.S. Congressional districts; and which concerned local government districts. The Warren Court's decision, which was upheld in . , said states may use total population in drawing districts. = Other uses = * In Alaska, when an initiative for instant runoff voting (IRV) was put on the ballot in 2002, League of Women Voters President Cheryl Jebe said, \\"It appears to compromise the well-established principle of one person, one vote, established by the United States Supreme Court.\\"Alaska Voters Mull Instant Runoff However, the Leagues of Women Voters in at least ten other states have endorsed the use of IRV, recognizing that \\"while their vote may switch from one candidate to another between rounds, no voter is given more influence than any other in determining the final winner\\". * In 1975, a Michigan court ruling declared that \\"majority preferential voting,\\" as IRV was then known, did not violate the one-man, one-vote rule:Stephenson v Ann Arbor Board of Canvassers, fairvote.org, accessed 6 November 2013. > Under the 'M.P.V.

Because all tribal governments related to the two in question exist within present-day state boundaries, it has been suggested that such an arrangement could potentially violate the \\"one man, one vote\\" principle by granting a \\"super-vote\\"; a Cherokee or Choctaw voter would have two House representatives (state and tribal), whereas any other American would only have one.

It was founded in 1847 and conducted under the tradition of the Franciscan Friars of the Third Order Regular. The university is situated on in the forests and farmland of Loretto. History Saint Francis College was established in 1847 by six Franciscan teaching Brothers from Mountbellew, Ireland, who had been given land in Loretto by Michael O'Connor, the first Bishop of Pittsburgh, to establish a school. The university was one of the first Catholic universities in the United States and the first Franciscan college in the nation. Although it originally only admitted males, it became one of the first Catholic Universities to become co- educational. Loretto is the site of the first English-language Roman Catholic settlement established west of the Allegheny Front, in what is now the United States, by Demetrius Augustine Gallitzin in 1799. In 2001 Saint Francis College was approved to change to become a university by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and renamed to Saint Francis University.  Academics  Saint Francis University enrolls approximately 1,658 undergraduate students (of whom 1,392 are traditional students and 266 are continuing education students) and 527 graduate students. The university offers 25 undergraduate majors and 7 graduate fields of study (including Physical Therapy, in which the university awards a doctorate) to its students.History of Saint Francis University The university maintains an average graduation rate of 70.3%. Campus The main building for the Southern Alleghenies Museum of Art, which also has a number of smaller facilities across the local region, is located on campus. Also on the campus are The DiSepio Institute for Rural Health and Wellness, the Center for the Study of Occupational Regulation (CSOR), Center for Watershed Research & Service, and The Institute for Contemporary Franciscan Life. Immergr√ºn Golf Course is a semi-private, nine-hole, regulation-length 3,234-yard, par-36 course on rye grass located on the campus of Saint Francis University at 105 Saint Elizabeth Street. Immergr√ºn has not been altered since Donald Ross built it for the steel magnate Charles M. Schwab in 1917. Saint Francis University also runs a campus at Ambialet France in the Midi-Pyr√©n√©es. All classes are in English. Athletics Athletically, Saint Francis competes in the NCAA's Northeast Conference. Their nickname is the Red Flash. The University has a total of 22 varsity sports teams, with nine men's teams and 13 women's programs all competing in NCAA Division I. Men's sports include basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, tennis, and track & field competing in the Northeast Conference and volleyball, which competes in the Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA); while women's sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track & field and volleyball which compete in the Northeast Conference and field hockey which competes in the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10). Saint Francis University will be adding Women's Water Polo in 2016-2017 school year as its 23 varsity sport at the Division 1 level. In addition to this, there are also two club sport teams, ice hockey and baseball.

The Cresta was introduced in 1954 as an upmarket version of the Vauxhall Velox, itself a six-cylinder version of the Vauxhall Wyvern. The Cresta models were the E (1954‚Äì1957), PA (1957‚Äì1962), PB (1962‚Äì1965) and PC (1965‚Äì1972). The Viscount (1966‚Äì1972) was an upmarket Cresta PC. __TOC__ Cresta E The Vauxhall Velox had been introduced in 1948, with a new version in 1951. The Cresta E version, launched in 1954, had the same 2262 cc six cylinder engine in the same state of tune but scored over the Velox in having a choice of leather or fabric upholstery, optional two tone paintwork, a heater as standard, a small electric fascia mounted clock, a cigar lighter, a lamp automatically illuminating the boot when opened and a vanity mirror on the inside of the front passenger's sun visor along with a special ornamental badge above the V (for Vauxhall) badge on the nose of the car. A radio was optional. In October 1955 a facelift model with deeper front and rear screens was introduced. The balanced drop windows were replaced by ones with proper winding mechanisms, there were interior trim improvements, separate amber rear flasher lights and windscreen washers became standard. A new chrome plated grille with fewer vertical slats replaced the earlier diecast version. This model was assembled in New Zealand, alongside the Wyvern and Velox, with 840 being built in 1956, according to a local owners' group with access to copies of the GM Petone plant ledgers. More changes were made in October 1956, with a new grille with horizontal bars, higher compression ratio engine, electrically operated windscreen wipers (replacing the camshaft driven system) and changes to the body trim and two tone colour scheme. In June 1957 the Cresta received a redesigned engine of the same capacity based on the deeper block design introduced in four-cylinder form in the Victor F series in March of that year. A Cresta tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 20.2 seconds. A petrol consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£931 including taxes.

It mimicked the American fashion for tail-fins, wrap-around windows and white-wall tyres, taking its cues from the 1957 model Buick Special announced twelve months before the Cresta, though understated compared to the Cadillacs and Buicks of the time. All factory-built PAs were four-door saloons: the estate cars were converted by Friary of Basingstoke, Hampshire and are rare today. The PA Cresta had independent front suspension using coil springs and an anti-roll bar with a rigid axle and semi-elliptic leaf springs at the rear. The Lockheed brakes used drums all round. Carried over from the last of the E series cars, the 2,262 cc six-cylinder engine had pushrod-operated overhead valves and a compression ratio of 7.8:1 (a low compression 6.8:1 version was available); it produced at 4,400 rpm. A single Zenith carburettor was used. The transmission had three forward speeds. It was well equipped with leather and nylon upholstery for its bench front and rear seats and woven pile carpet. A heater was fitted as standard. The radio remained an option on the home market. Other options included fog lamps, reversing light, locking filler cap and external mirrors. In order to keep the front floor clear to seat six people the handbrake lever was mounted under the dashboard and the gearchange lever was column mounted. The car could be ordered painted in either single or two tone colours. A PA tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1958 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 16.8 seconds. A petrol consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£1073 including taxes of ¬£358. They tested the 2.6 Litre version with overdrive in 1960 and found the top speed had increased to , acceleration from 0- to 15.2 seconds and fuel consumption improved to . The test car cost ¬£1077 including taxes of ¬£317. The car without overdrive cost ¬£1014. 1957 Vauxhall Cresta Saloon.jpgPA S saloon 1957 1957 Vauxhall Cresta Saloon rear.jpgPA S saloon 1957 rear Vauxhall PA Cresta Friary Estate 1966 - Flickr - mick - Lumix.jpgPA SY Friary estate 1962 Blue Vauxhall Cresta in Tel Aviv ISRAEL October 2011.jpgPA saloon in Israel Australian assembly of the PA Cresta began in May 1958 by General Motors Holden. Subsequent models were assembled up until 1965.https://www.shannons.com.au/club/news/1958-62-vauxhall-pa-veloxcresta- did-australians-still-need-holden/ In August 1959 the Cresta was given a facelift, with a new, larger, grille and the replacement of the three piece rear window with a single wrap around screen. The previous ribbed roof panel was replaced with a smoothly contoured version (with structural revisions to the C pillars and rear parcel shelf area to retain structural strength). The Vauxhall flutes on the front wings finally disappeared, replaced by a straight chrome side moulding which was also the division point for the two tone colour scheme. Further changes came in August 1960 with the introduction of a new engine of square dimensions (bore and stroke were both 82.55mm) with a redesigned, longer, cylinder block and a capacity of 2651cc. A further increase in compression ratio to 8.0:1 and larger valves in wedge shaped combustion chambers contributed to a power output of 95bhp at 4,600rpm. Increased diameter wheels allowed larger brakes to be fitted, but these were still of the drum type (Ford had introduced front disc brakes as an option on the rival Zephyr/Zodiac models in September 1960 and would make them standard in June 1961). Externally, there was a redesign of the rear lights, with shallower units replacing the elongated oval ones of the previous versions. The direction indicators, previously in the rear tail fins were now incorporated in the main lamp unit and the fins were now solid with a V for Vauxhall badge. The rear bumper was now a higher mounted straight topped design. The front sidelights and direction indicators, previously separate were now in a combined housing and there were redesigned wheel trims and hub caps. Inside, a redesigned fascia with a padded top and a horizontal speedometer was featured. In October 1961 the final updates to the PA series were made. Front disc brakes became an optional extra (four months after Ford had made them standard on the Zephyr/Zodiac). Separate front seats became an option to the standard bench and there was now wood trim to the fascia and door cappings. The PA Cresta continued in production in this form until replaced by the PB series in October 1962. During the 1970s many PA Crestas were modified and customised. The model was very popular with fifties revivalists; many were driven by teddy boys and were very much seen as part of the rock 'n' roll image. A 1960 PA Cresta features in the 1981 video for \\"Ghost Town\\" by The Specials, in which the band are wearing '50s-style clothing.The Specials Ghost Town Car can now be seen in The Coventry Music Museum. Today the PA Cresta is a recognised classic, with the other variants perhaps less appreciated but gaining recognition. One famous PA owner in the late 1950s was Don Lang. Cresta PB The PB was a major styling revision, completely eliminating the tailfins, with a flat bonnet and generally more conservative styling taking its cues from the Victor FB introduced the previous year and with which it shared its doors. The engine was the same straight six as the last of the PA series and although the compression ratio was increased to 8.5:1, power output remained at 95 bhp. Front disc brakes were now fitted as standard. In October 1963 an estate conversion was made available, the work carried out by Martin Walter Ltd. of Bedford Dormobile fame and fully approved by Vauxhall. The conversion featured a steel-framed glass fibre roof extension and tailgate. The rear doors with squared-off window frames were straight from the factory-built Victor estate. In October 1964 the engine was increased in capacity to 3293 cc by virtue of a larger, 92 mm, bore in combination with the original 82.55 mm stroke. Power increased to 115 bhp at 4,200 rpm. The model received a new full-width chrome grille incorporating the headlights and there was a full-length chrome strip along the body sides. The gearbox was still three-speed with column change but an overdrive was available. As standard, the 3.3-litre cars had a three-speed column-change gearbox, with a four-speed floor-change unit as an option. Three-speed hydramatic automatic transmission was available with both engines but this was changed to the two-speed Powerglide unit towards the end of the 3.3-litre PB run. Servo-assisted brakes, with discs at the front, were fitted. Minor changes to gearing and the option of power steering were introduced early in 1965 and the PB series continued until replaced by the PC models in October of that year. Australia continued to locally assemble the PB Cresta. New Zealand fully imported the PB Cresta from Britain.

No longer offered as a lower specification Velox version, it was designated PCS (standard), PCD (Deluxe) and PCE (Executive), this last having its own name, 'Viscount'. It was a different car, larger and styled with the coke-bottle look that would also be seen in the FD Victor series: it now resembled a slightly smaller Chevrolet Impala. It was similar to the Australian Holden HR, but larger and better trimmed, and featured the 123 DIN/142 SAE hp 3.3-litre straight-six engine for its entire seven-year production run. Though a small-block V8 would have dropped straight in, this option was never offered in Europe. Initially, the three-speed column-shift manual transmission was standard with optional overdrive; four-speed manual and two-speed Powerglide were also optional. Later cars, from about 1971, came with four-speed manual or three-speed automatic, both having floor shift and bucket seats. The De-Luxe version had four headlamps instead of the two fitted on the (much rarer) base models. General Motors Holden assembly of the Cresta ended in 1965, therefore the PC Cresta was not sold in Australia. General Motors New Zealand ran its own assembly line in Petone (1966-67) and Trentham, near Wellington, to 1971. Up until 1966 the Cresta was fully imported from Britain. From 1966 the Petone plant began locally assembly of the Cresta. The one 'base' Cresta model built changed very little during that time and did not receive the facelift that appeared on the UK market late in 1970 as the 1971 model. The only option was the 2 speed Powerglide. However, at some point in production (1970) the brake system was upgraded to a tandem master cylinder to improve the braking, and this upgrade became a standard fitment on the New Zealand models. A few twin-headlamp Cresta Deluxe, Viscount and estate car versions were also imported, built-up, from the UK. The facelifted model, never offered in New Zealand, had twin headlamps as standard and a more integrated dash panel. Floor shift, rather than column change, was also standard. Vauxhall Cresta PC from behind) In January 1967 domestic market deliveries began of the Vauxhall Cresta estate car. This vehicle resulted from a conversion by Martin Walter of Folkestone, a firm better known for their (primarily Bedford based) Dormobile motorhome conversions. The estate version was higher than the saloon due to a combination of heavy-duty rear suspension, an increase in the outer diameter of the tyres (to 7.00-14 in from 5.90-14in) and the modified roof line. The Cresta estate was initially offered in the UK at ¬£1,507, which represented a price premium of around 40% over the equivalent saloon. The long established Humber Hawk estate and recently introduced Ford Zephyr estate carried UK sales prices of ¬£1,342 and ¬£1,379 respectively. The Cresta estate offered a load platform length of which increased to an impressive when the back seat was folded down, but Vauxhall's contender was never priced to be a big seller and the last estate cars were made in 1968. Viscount Introduced early in June 1966, with the same engine and mechanical components as the Cresta PC, the Viscount was the super de-luxe version of it. It was supplied as standard with power steering, electric windows, reclining seats, a vinyl roof, walnut dashboard, inertia reel seat belts front, and even a heated rear window. Areas of the grille and headlamp surrounds were blacked out to give a classier look and the tail-lights had a chrome overlay. The dark green, blue or maroon paintwork featured simulated, hand painted coachlines, along each flank, to give the car a coachpainted appearance. The outer pair of the quad, five inch, sealed beam headlamps were twin filament, giving the car four main beams. The Viscount also came with wider tyres and rims than the Cresta (7.00-14in on 5\\" rims rather than 5.90-14in on 4.5\\" rims). All PC 3.3 had twin tail-pipes. The standard transmission option was GM's Powerglide 2-speed automatic system, but a four speed manual gearbox was available, initially on the UK market at a saving of ¬£85: elsewhere the manual gear box was a no-cost option. In the third quarter of 1970 the two-speed Powerglide automatic was replaced with a GM 3-speed automatic transmission. Some South African versions were fitted with a Chrysler V8 as an option - one of the rare times a General Motors product used a direct rival's engine. The British version of the Vauxhall Viscount automatic with the 2-speed Powerglide transmission was road tested by Motor ref.33/66 on 3 September 1966. A maximum (best) top speed of 100mph was recorded with 0-60 mph in 14.5secs, Standing quarter mile in 20.3secs. Overall mpg was 15.6. The later automatic Viscount model, with the 3 speed Strasbourg GM transmission, ought to have improved on these acceleration figures, especially at the lower speeds. Motor magazine dated 03/09/1966 road test ref. 33/66. Use by British Royalty In the 1950s and 60s Queen Elizabeth II used a bespoke PA Friary Estate, and later a PC version of the Cresta as personal transport. The Queen's PA Friary estate forms part of The Royal Car Collection at the Sandringham Exhibition & Transport Museum.

In other words, it does not actively initiate, or is not actively responsible for, the action of the verb. An unaccusative verb's subject is semantically similar to the direct object of a transitive verb or to the subject of a verb in the passive voice. Examples in English are \\"the tree fell\\"; \\"the window broke\\". In those sentences, the action (falling, breaking) can be considered as something that happened to the subject, rather than being initiated by it. Semantically, the word \\"tree\\" in the sentence \\"the tree fell\\" plays a similar role as it does in a transitive sentence, such as \\"they cut down the tree\\", or its passive transformation \\"the tree was cut down\\". Unaccusative verbs thus contrast with unergative verbs, such as run or resign, which describe actions voluntarily initiated by the subject. They are called unaccusative because although the subject has the semantic role of a patient, it is not assigned accusative case. In nominative‚Äìaccusative languages, the accusative case, which marks the direct object of transitive verbs, usually represents the non-volitional argument (often the patient). However, for unaccusative verbs, although the subject is non-volitional, it is not marked by the accusative. As Perlmutter points out, the same verb such as \\"slide\\" can be either unaccusative or unergative, depending on whether the action was involuntary or voluntary.Perlmutter (1978), p. 163. The term \\"unaccusative verb\\" was first used in a 1978 paper by David M. Perlmutter of the University of California, San Diego.Google ngrams. According to Perlmutter himself, the terms \\"unaccusative\\" and \\"unergative\\" were both invented by the linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum.Perlmutter (1978) p.186.  Tests for unaccusativity  As mentioned above, the unaccusative/unergative split in intransitive verbs can be characterized semantically. Unaccusative verbs tend to express a telic and dynamic change of state or location, while unergative verbs tend to express an agentive activity (not involving directed movement). While these properties define the \\"core\\" classes of unaccusatives and unergatives, there are intermediate classes of verbs whose status is less clear (for example, verbs of existence, appearance, or continuation, verbs denoting uncontrolled processes, or motion verbs). A number of syntactic criteria for unaccusativity have also been identified. The most well-known test is auxiliary selection in languages that use two different temporal auxiliaries (have and be) for analytic past/perfect verb forms (e.g. German, Dutch, French, Italian; even Early Modern English). In these languages, unaccusative verbs combine with be, while unergative verbs combine with have. : French: : unaccusative: ' lit. \\"I am fallen.\\" (= \\"I have fallen.\\") : unergative: ' \\"I have worked.\\" : Italian: : unaccusative: ' lit. \\"[He] is arrived.\\" (= \\"He has arrived.\\") : unergative: ' \\"[He] has phoned.\\" From one language to another, however, synonymous verbs do not always select the same auxiliary, and even within one language, a single verb may combine with either auxiliary (either depending on the meaning/context, or with no observable semantic motivation, sometimes depending on regional variation of the language). The auxiliary selection criterion therefore also identifies core classes of unaccusative and unergatives (which show the least variation within and across languages) and more peripheral classes (where variation and context effects are observed). Other tests that have been studied involve passivization (see Impersonal passive voice), ne/en cliticization in Italian and French, and impersonal, participial, and resultative constructions in a wide range of languages. For example, in Dutch and Turkish, unergative verbs can be used in impersonal passive constructions, but unaccusative verbs cannot.Perlmutter (1978), p. 168‚Äì9. In the following example from Dutch, the verb is unergative, describing a voluntary action, and can be made passive: :Er wordt hier veel geskied. :\\"A lot of skiing is done here.\\" (lit. \\"it is skied much here\\") But a sentence with an unaccusative verb, such as \\"The concert lasted a long time\\", cannot be made passive. In Japanese, the grammaticality of sentences that appear to violate syntactic rules may signal the presence of an unaccusative verb. According to transformational models of grammar, such sentences contain a trace located in the direct object position that helps to satisfy the mutual c-command condition between numeral quantifiers and the noun phrases they modify (Tsujimura, 2007).  Unaccusativity in English  Modern English only uses one perfect auxiliary (have), although archaic examples like \\"He is fallen/come\\" reflect the use of be with unaccusative verbs in earlier stages of the language. The identification of unaccusative verbs in English is therefore based on other criteria. For example, many unaccusatives alternate with a corresponding transitive construction where the unaccusative subject appears in direct object position: : melted. ‚âà melted . : broke. ‚âà broke . Unaccusative past participles can be used as nominal modifiers with active meaning, while unergative past participles cannot: : unaccusative: the melted snow, the departed guests, the fallen soldiers : unergative: *the shouted victim, *the slept child, *the hesitated leader Finally, unaccusative subjects can generally be modified by a resultative adjunct. This is a property shared by direct objects and passive subjects, but not shared by the subjects of unergative and transitive verbs. : unaccusative subject: broke into pieces. : direct object: broke into pieces. : passive subject: was broken into pieces. : unergative subject: * dined full/to death/two pounds heavier. : subject of transitive verb: * ate full/to death/two pounds heavier. While \\"to die\\" has been classiffied as an unaccusative verb, like \\"to fall\\" and \\"to arrive\\".

DOI: 10.18290/rh.2016.64.11-2 noted that \\"to die\\" is an example of Unaccusative Mismatch, because \\"to die\\" behaves: : unaccusatively in some tests, e.g. (!)There laughed in the room (unergative) vs. There appeared on the scene (unaccusative) vs. There died ; : yet unergatively in others, e.g. died vs. (!) died . Examples Perlmutter (1978) gives examples of various types of unaccusative verbs. He emphasises that the following categories are not definitive, but that alternative classifications are possible.Perlmutter (1978), pp. 162-3. (a) The verb \\"be\\" with adjectives: :be heavy, be red, etc. (b) Those where the grammatical subject is semantically a Patient: :(i) burn, fall, sink, float, flow, slip, slide, shake, stumble, succumb, boil, dry, sway, wave, lie (involuntary), bend (involuntary) :(ii) melt, freeze, evaporate, solidify, darken, rot, wither, collapse, break, increase, germinate, die, suffocate, crack, split, disappear, disperse, explode (c) Predicates of existing and happening: :exist, happen, occur, arise, ensue, turn up (d) Non-voluntary verbs of appearance, sound, smell, etc.: :shine, sparkle, clink, snap (involuntary), pop, smell (bad), stink (e) Aspectual predicates: :begin, start, stop, continue, end (f) Duratives: :last, remain, stay, survive He points out that some verbs can be used in either unaccusative or unergative clauses. If the action is deliberate or willed, the clause is unergative: :The figurine stood on this table. ‚Äì (unaccusative) :The children stood on this table. ‚Äì (unergative)  Recent developments  The derivation of the core properties of unaccusative constructions from a set of principles is one of the topmost issues of the agenda of modern syntax since the seminal work by Perlmutter 1978 (cf. Burzio 1986 and Hale-Keyser 2003 for landmark proposals). More specifically, the first approach arrived at an important consequence constituting an analogy between English passive voice constructions and unaccusative constructions whereas in the second approach a more radical theory was proposed based on the analysis of expletive there stemming from the sentences with the copula suggested in Moro 1997.

For example, in some Romance languages, such verbs use different auxiliaries when in compound tenses. Besides the above, unergative verbs differ from unaccusative verbs in that in some languages, they can occasionally use the passive voice. In Dutch, for example, unergatives take (to have) in the perfect tenses: : :\\"I call (by phone). ‚Äì I have called.\\" In such cases, a transition to an impersonal passive construction is possible by using the adverb er, which functions as a dummy subject and the passive auxiliary : : :\\"*There is by Jan telephoned.\\" (literally \\"A telephone call by Jan is going on.\\") By contrast, Dutch ergative verbs take (\\"to be\\") in the perfect tenses: : :\\"The grease solidifies ‚Äì The grease has solidified.\\" In that case, no passive construction with is possible.

When his arrow hit the ground, water poured out (translates to Thirtha) and quenched her thirst. Because the river, according to the legend, originated with this event, the river is called \\"Sharavati\\" as \\"Shara\\" translates to arrow.A brief description of Ambutheertha is provided by The total length of the river is around and it joins the Arabian Sea at Honnavar in Uttara Kannada district.A detailed study on the Sharavati river is made by On its way, the Sharavati forms the Jog Falls where the river falls from a height of 253 m. The river is dammed at Linganamakki; the portion of the river above the dam is upstream and the remaining is downstream. The major tributaries of the river are Nandihole, Haridravathi, Mavinahole, Hilkunji, Yennehole, Hurlihole, and Nagodihole. Sharavati river basin falls into two districts of Karnataka namely Uttara Kannada and Shimoga. The upstream river basin is extended to two taluks i.e, Hosanagar and Sagar. The entire basin has an area of with upstream being and the downstream being . Geology The river basin mainly consists of Pre- Cambrian rocks. The two major groups of rocks found in the Sharavati river basin are the Dharwar system and the peninsular gneiss. * The Dharwar system: This system contains metamorphic rocks that are considered to be among the oldest in India. These rocks are derived from ancient sediments like conglomerates, ferruginous quartzites, greywackes, schists and limestones. They are rich in iron and manganese. * Peninsular gneiss: These are crystalline rocks and are made up of granite, granodiorite, granito-gneiss, migmatite etc. Soils in the Sharavati basin are mainly lateritic in origin and tend to be acidic and reddish to brownish in colour. The various type of soil found here are clay loamy, clayey, clayey-skeletal, and loamy.A detailed description of the Sharavati river basin is provided by Four soil orders are found in the upstream river basin: ultisols, alfisols, inceptisols and entisols. Climate River Sharavati =Rainfall= With a major part of the river lying in the Western Ghats, the Sharavati river basin receives a large amount of rainfall. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 6000 mm in the western side to 1700 mm in the eastern side of the basin. About 95% of the rainfall is received during the month of June to September (July being the rainiest) when the southwest monsoon is at its peak. There is some rainfall in the post monsoon season in the form of thundershowers mostly during October and some rainfall also occurs during the summer months of April and May. =Temperature= April is usually the hottest month with the mean daily maximum temperature at 35.8 ¬∞C and the mean daily minimum at 22.2 ¬∞C. =Humidity= During the morning, the relative humidity exceeds 75% for most times of the year. During the months of monsoon, the relative humidity during the afternoons is approximately 60%. During the driest months (January to March), the relative humidity in the afternoon is less than 35%. Dams =Linganamakki dam= The Linganamakki dam located in the Sagar taluk has a length of and was constructed across the Sharavati river in 1964. It was designed to impound 4368 million cubic meter of water in an area of around , submerging of wetland and of dry land, the remaining being forest land and wasteland. The dam's height is above sea level. The total capacity of the reservoir is 152 TMC (Thousand Million Cubicfeet). It has a catchment area of nearly . It receives water mainly from rainfall and also from the Chakra and Savahaklu reservoirs, which are linked through Linganamakki through a canal. The water from Linganamakki dam flows to Talakalale Balancing Reservoir through a trapezoidal canal with a discharge capacity of 175.56 cubic metres per second. The length of this channel is about 4318.40 m with a submersion of . It has a catchment area of about . The gross capacity of the reservoir is 129.60 cu meters. =Gerusoppa dam= The Gerusoppa dam project was completed in 2002 with the main purpose of generation of electricity. It was constructed near the Gerusoppa village in the Uttara Kannada district. It has a height of 56 metres and a length of 545 metres. The Power House on the right bank of the Gerusoppa dam consists of four Francis-type turbines coupled to the generating units of 60 MW each. The units are configured to operate at a design head of 47.5 m. An outdoor switchyard is located between the toe of the dam and the power house. Power from the outdoor yard is evacuated through a 220 kV double circuit transmission line connected to the state grid at Talaguppa. The Gerusoppa Project is a KPC project and the Civil Chief Engineer at the time of completion of the project was K L Krishnamurthy. This is one of the projects constructed by R. N. Shetty under the name Naveen Mechanised Construction Company Private Limited. The Present Chief Engineer (Electrical) is Shivaji . The main power house was constructed by Mr.Chinna Nachimuthu. Waterfalls =Jog Falls= Jog Falls is the highest waterfall in India if the single drop water fall and the volume of water are considered for height. Otherwise, it is the third highest waterfall in India (after Kunchikal Falls and Barkana Falls); all three are located in Shivamogga district. The Sharavati river plunges 253 meters (830 ft) into a deep gorge here in four different segments called as Raja, Roarer, Rocket and Rani. The volume of water that reaches Jog Falls is controlled upstream by the Linganamakki dam, and the falls are at their mightiest when water is released from the dam. Flora and fauna The endangered lion-tailed macaque found in the Sharavati Valley wildlife sanctuary The Sharavati river basin is rich in biodiversity. In a survey conducted in the basin, 23 amphibians belonging to the families of Bufonidae, Ichthyophiidae, Microhylidae, Ranidae and Rhacophoridae were recorded. Of these, 15 species are endemic to the Western Ghats. The river lends its name to the following species of fish that have been discovered in its waters: * Batasio sharavatiensis: A bagrid catfish discovered near Jog Falls, Uttara Kannada district.Discovery of Batasio sharavatiensis has been mentioned by * Schistura sharavatiensis: A fish species discovered in Sharavati river near Algod, Shimoga district.Details regarding new fishes of genus Schistura found in Sharavati river is provided by Recently two new species of diatoms were discovered from Hirebhaskeri Dam of Sharavati River. = Sharavati Valley Wildlife Sanctuary = View of Sharavati Valley A part of the Sharavati river basin was declared as a wildlife sanctuary on 20 April 1972.A Walk on the Wild Side, An Information Guide to National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries of Karnataka, Compiled and Edited by Dr. Nima Manjrekar, Karnataka Forest Department, Wildlife Wing, October 2000 Spread over an area of , it has dense evergreen and semi-evergreen forests. Linganamakki reservoir, with an area of , is a part of this sanctuary. The remaining area has been divided into core zone (74.33 km2.), buffer zone (170.67 km2) and tourism zone (57.53 km2). The altitude in the sanctuary varies from 94 m to 1102 m, the highest point being Devarakonda on the southern edge of the sanctuary. Temperatures range from 15¬∞ to 38 ¬∞C and the mean annual rainfall is 4500 mm. ;Flora The sanctuary has mainly evergreen, semi-green and some moist deciduous forests. Trees in the evergreen forest include species such as Dipterocarpus indicus, Calophyllum tomentosum, Machilus macrantha, Caryota urens and Aporosa lindleyana. In the semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests, common species include Lagerstroemia lanceolata, Hopea parviflora, Dalbergia latifolia, Dillenia pentagyna, Careya arborea, Emblica officinalis, Randia sp., Terminalia sp. and Vitex altissima. ;Fauna The sanctuary is a refuge of the endangered lion- tailed macaque.

Pitting corrosion, or pitting, is a form of extremely localized corrosion that leads to the creation of small holes in the metal. The driving power for pitting corrosion is the depassivation of a small area, which becomes anodic (oxidation reaction) while an unknown but potentially vast area becomes cathodic (reduction reaction), leading to very localized galvanic corrosion. The corrosion penetrates the mass of the metal, with a limited diffusion of ions. The mechanism of pitting corrosion is probably the same as crevice corrosion. Mechanism Diagram showing a mechanism of localized corrosion developing on metal in a solution containing oxygen The more conventional explanation for pitting corrosion is that it is an autocatalytic process. Metal oxidation results in localized acidity that is maintained by the spatial separation of the cathodic and anodic half- reactions, which creates a potential gradient and electromigration of aggressive anions into the pit.ASM Handbook, Volume 13, \\"Corrosion\\", , ASM International, 1987 For example, when a metal is present in an oxygenated sodium-chloride electrolyte, the pit acts as anode and the metal surface acts as cathode. The localized production of positive metal ions in the pit gives a local excess of positive charge which attracts the negative chlorine ions from the electrolyte to produce charge neutrality. The pit contains a high concentration of metal (Me) chloride (MeCln) which hydrolyzes with water to produce the corresponding metal hydroxide (Me(OH)n), and n H+ and n Cl‚Äì ions, accelerating the corrosion process. In the pit, the oxygen concentration is essentially zero and all of the cathodic oxygen reactions take place on the metal surface outside the pit. The pit is anodic and the locus of rapid dissolution of the metal.princeton.edu, pitcorrosion. The metal corrosion initiation is autocatalytic in nature however its propagation is not. This kind of corrosion is often difficult to detect and so is extremely insidious, as it causes little loss of material with the small effect on its surface, while it damages the deep structures of the metal. The pits on the surface are often obscured by corrosion products. Pitting can be initiated by a small surface defect, being a scratch or a local change in the alloy composition (or local impurities, e.g. metallic sulfide inclusions such as MnS or NiS), or a damage to the protective coating. Polished surfaces display a higher resistance to pitting. Susceptible alloys and environment combinations Pitting corrosion is defined by localized attack, ranging from microns to millimeters in diameter, in an otherwise passive surface and only occurs for specific alloy and environmental combinations. Thus, this type of corrosion typically occurs in alloys that are protected by a tenacious (passivating) oxide film such as stainless steels, nickel alloys, aluminum alloys in environments that contain an aggressive species such as chlorides (Cl‚Äì) or thiosulfates (S2O32‚Äì). In contrast, alloy/environment combinations where the passive film is not very protective usually will not produce pitting corrosion. A good example of the importance of alloy/environment combinations is carbon steel. In environments where the pH value is lower than 10, carbon steel does not form a passivating oxide film and the addition of chloride results in uniform attack over the entire surface. However, at pH greater than 10 (alkaline) the oxide is protective and the addition of chloride results in pitting corrosion. Besides chlorides, other anions implicated in pitting include thiosulfates (S2O32‚àí), fluorides and iodides. Stagnant water conditions favor pitting. Thiosulfates are particularly aggressive species and are formed by partial oxidation of pyrite, or partial reduction of sulfate. Thiosulfates are a concern for corrosion in many industries handling sulfur- derived compounds: sulfide ores processing, oil wells and pipelines transporting soured oils, kraft paper production plants, photographic industry, methionine and lysine factories. Corrosion inhibitors, when present in sufficient amount, will provide protection against pitting. However, too low level of them can aggravate pitting by forming local anodes. Engineering failures due to pitting corrosion pipeline at a coating defect before and after abrasive blasting. The Silver Bridge collapsed into the Ohio River as a result of stress corrosion cracking. A single pit in a critical point can cause a great deal of damage. One example is the explosion in Guadalajara, Mexico on 22 April 1992, when gasoline fumes accumulated in sewers destroyed kilometers of streets. The vapors originated from a leak of gasoline through a single hole formed by corrosion between a steel gasoline pipe and a zinc- plated water pipe. Firearms can also suffer from pitting, most notably in the bore of the barrel when corrosive ammunition is used and the barrel is not cleaned soon afterwards. Deformities in the bore caused by pitting can greatly reduce the firearm's accuracy. To prevent pitting in firearm bores, most modern firearms have a bore lined with chromium. Pitting corrosion can also help initiate stress corrosion cracking, as happened when a single eyebar on the Silver Bridge in West Virginia, United States failed and killed 46 people on the bridge in December 1967.Silver Bridge Collapse, Corrosion Doctors, read May 13, 2016 See also *Corrosion *Crevice corrosion *Micro pitting *Panel edge staining *Stress corrosion cracking  References  Category:Corrosion Category:Fouling ","title":"Pitting corrosion"},{"id":"1895069","text":"\\"There's No Business Like Show Business\\" is an Irving Berlin song, written for the 1946 musical Annie Get Your Gun and orchestrated by Ted Royal. The song, a slightly tongue-in-cheek salute to the glamour and excitement of a life in show business, is sung in the musical by members of Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show in an attempt to persuade Annie Oakley to join the production. It is reprised three times in the musical. In 1953, Ethel Merman sang the song before a live television audience of 60 million persons, broadcast live over the NBC and CBS networks, as part of The Ford 50th Anniversary Show. The song is also featured in the 1954 movie of the same name, where it is notably sung by Ethel Merman as the main musical number. The movie, directed by Walter Lang, is essentially a catalog of various Berlin's pieces, in the same way that Singin' in the Rain‚Äîwhich starred Donald O'Connor as well‚Äîwas a collection of Arthur Freed songs. There was also a disco version of the song made during the 1970s, with Merman reprising her singing role in The Ethel Merman Disco Album. The song became one of Ethel Merman's standards and was often performed by her at concerts and on television. Other singers to have recorded the song include Judy Garland, The Andrews Sisters (with Bing Crosby and Dick Haymes), Frank Sinatra, Harry Connick Jr. (from Come by Me, 1999), Susannah McCorkle, Mary Hopkin, and Bernadette Peters. The Andrews Sisters version with Bing Crosby and Dick Haymes was recorded on March 19, 1947 and was the only version to reach the Billboard charts, albeit briefly at No. 25. In his liner notes for Susannah McCorkle's version of the song on her Ballad Essentials album Scott Yanow writes \\"usually performed as a corny razzle- dazzle romp, that piece was drastically slowed down by Susannah who performed all of its known lyrics, including stanzas that show Irving Berlin's lyrics were actually quite touching and meaningful\\". Tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins did a rendition of the tune on his 1956 Prestige album, Work Time. Popular culture * Borscht Belt entertainer Allan Sherman parodied the song as \\"There‚Äôs No Governor Like Our New Governor\\" to poke fun at California's election of Hollywood actor Ronald Reagan. * The Canadian band Sweeney Todd included part of the lyrics in their song \\"Say Hello Say Goodbye\\" from their album If Wishes Were Horses. * The Ethel Merman recording is featured in the film All That Jazz (1979). * From 1976 to 2007 the rock band Genesis played the Ethel Merman recording at the end of gigs‚Äîit can be heard at the end of their 1977 live album Seconds Out. * The song is featured during the epilogue of the HBO film The Late Shift. * During the credits of Noises Off, Niki Haris sings a form of the song. * In the 2000 musical film version of Love's Labour's Lost, Nathan Lane sings a version of the song. * Liza Minnelli performed a portion of the song on her 1992 album \\"Live From Radio City Music Hall.\\" * In RuPaul's Drag Race: All Stars, contestants Latrice Royale and Tammie Brown performed a lip-sync to the Ethel Merman version for the episode \\"RuPaul's Gaff-In.\\" * British comedian and impressionist Bobby Davro included a sketch \\"The Kidnapping of Bonnie Langford\\" on his 1980s ITV show, which concluded with Langford (played by Jessica Martin) loudly performing the song in order to nauseate her kidnappers into releasing her. * The song is sampled in Taco's cover of another Irving Berlin song, \\"Puttin' On the Ritz\\", released in 1982. * The song's opening line forms the basis for a dialog between R.K. Maroon and Eddie Valiant in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). * An instrumental version of the song is used as part of the score in the Australian variety show Hey Hey It's Saturday. * Mary Hopkin's version is used in season 2 of \\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\".

The village lies about north of Cherhill and east of the town of Calne.  Parish church  St Swithin's Church The Church of England parish church of St Swithin, in the southwest of the village, is from the late 12th century, when it belonged to Bicester priory. Work from the 12th and 13th centuries survives in the nave while the tower and clerestory are from the 15th. The finely-carved stone screen is also 15th-century and is described by Pevsner as \\"what remains in one's memory\\". In 1865 Henry Woodyer added the north porch and rebuilt the chancel with its side-chapels; the east window by Hardman is from the same time. The church was designated as Grade I listed in 1960. Today it forms part of the Oldbury Benefice, a group of five rural parishes. The rectory built c. 1840 was sold in 1968. =Midge Mather incident= In 1997, Compton Bassett church gained notoriety when a local resident, 65-year-old Midge Mather, broke into the church and cut through the bell ropes because she could not stand the noise of the bells. It took her upwards of two hours after breaking down the doors to cut the ropes and when she got home she rang the police and told them what she had done. She was given a Conditional Discharge for her actions.  Compton Bassett House  A manor house stood at Compton Bassett in 1553. A later house with a courtyard, standing in 1659, was later called Compton Bassett House. In 1672 the courtyard was built over to form a rectangular house with corner towers, having white stone walls. The house was encased in brick in the 19th century, probably by George Heneage Walker-Heneage, Member of Parliament for Devizes 1838-1857. Its parkland extended south and west into Cherhill parish, and in 1830 a half-timbered lodge was built at the western entrance. The house was demolished in the early 1930s, and in 1935 its stable block was converted to a house, also called Compton Bassett House. Former RAF station RAF Compton Bassett was opened as a communications training station in 1940, on farmland between Compton Bassett and Calne. Like nearby RAF Yatesbury, it continued in the post-war years before closing in 1964. The housing around the station continued to be used by RAF staff working at RAF Lyneham and other westcountry RAF bases, and in the 1980s by American service personnel stationed at US airbases such as Fairford and Greenham Common. The housing has now been sold to private buyers. The former site of RAF Compton Bassett is now known as Lower Compton, after the petitioning by residents for a separate name, since it lies two miles from the village of Compton Bassett.  Amenities  The village has a pub, the White Horse Inn. There is no school; the small school of 1854, later a National School, closed in 1964 owing to the low number of pupils. Notable residents The travel writer Henry Maundrell was born in Compton Bassett in 1665. Major Clement Walker Heneage, awarded the Victoria Cross, was born here in 1831. Architect Sir Norman Foster owned Compton Bassett House until 1992, and in 2008 it was bought by pop star Robbie Williams. In May 2013, the comedian Michael McIntyre purchased a property in the village.

The company operates 19 development studios worldwide, and publishes games with a special focus on the mobile games market. Formerly a public company traded at the Paris Bourse, Gameloft was acquired by media conglomerate Vivendi in 2016.  History  = Game development strategy = Gameloft was founded by Michel Guillemot, one of the five founders of Ubisoft, on 14 December 1999. By February 2009, Gameloft had shipped over 200 million copies of its games since its IPO, as well as 2 million daily downloads of its games via the App Store for iOS. Gameloft's chief financial officer (CFO), Alexandre de Rochefort, noted that the company's games generated about 400 times more revenue on iOS than on Android, partially because Google did not develop its Google Play storefront to \\"entice customers to actually buy products\\"; as a result of which Gameloft heavily cut its investments in Android games development in November 2009. In July 2010, Gameloft instead attempted to sell Android games directly through its website, avoiding the use of Google Play. In a May 2011 keynote, de Rochefort stated that he wanted to avoid moving the company to the NASDAQ stock exchange, as the U.S. games market appeared to be nothing more than a large economic bubble, especially when seeing Zynga's present total stock value. Gameloft's games have often been accused of being clones of other properties; when asked about it at the November 2011 Consumer Electronics Show, chief executive officer (CEO) Michel Guillemot stated \\"The videogame industry has always played around a limited number of themes. There is maybe one new idea a year.\\" In response to many users commenting on Guillemot's remarks, Levi Buchanan of IGN defended Gameloft, stating that its games were usually well-polished, in contrary to the original concepts' games. By July 2014, Gameloft announced that they would focus more strongly on quality than on quantity, as was stated to have previously been the case. In April 2013, Texan company Lodsys filed a lawsuit against Gameloft, among other mobile game developers, for infringing its patent on in-app purchases. Similar lawsuits were previously intervened by Apple Inc., who claim to have licensed the technology from Lodsys for usage in its App Store. In February 2012 and February 2016, Gameloft penned publishing contracts with GREE, Inc. and GungHo Online Entertainment, respectively, to facilitate its presence in the Asian market. = Vivendi subsidiary = In October 2015, French media conglomerate Vivendi announced that they had acquired a 6.2% stake in Gameloft's stock, which was quickly raised to 10.2% a few days later. By February 2016, Vivendi had acquired 30% in the company, and launched a hostile takeover bid. In accordance with French law, Vivendi started a tender offer to acquire further shares. Following the announcement, Gameloft's board of directors strongly advised shareholders against selling stock to Vivendi to avoid the hostile takeover. By May 2016, Vivendi had won over the majority of shareholders, enabling them to move forward in the takeover. The acquisition was completed on 1 June 2016, with Vivendi having acquired 56%, an absolute majority over Gameloft's ownership. Employees of Gameloft were presented with an open letter welcoming them to the new parent company's family. Analysts believed that the takeover was just the first step towards also purchasing Ubisoft, another video game venture founded by Guillemot and his brothers, although Vivendi only held a 17.7% minority in that company at the time. In response to Vivendi's actions, Guillemot announced that he would step down from his company and join his brother Yves Guillemot at Ubisoft to prevent it from also being taken over. Guillemot later clarified that his stepping-down would take effect on 29 June. On 8 June, the Guillemot brothers announced that they were regretfully selling their ownership in Gameloft to Vivendi. The transaction awarded Vivendi another 21.7% in Gameloft's capital. After Guillemot departed from Gameloft on 29 June, Vivendi set up a new board of directors for the company, with Vivendi's present chief operating officer (COO), St√©phane Roussel, appointed Gameloft's chairman and CEO, and Gameloft's previous CFO, de Rochefort, additionally taking over the management of the company's 39 subsidiaries. At that point, Vivendi owned 95.94% of Gameloft's share capital.  Corporate affairs  Gameloft is headquartered at 14 rue Auber, in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. = Studios = Gameloft operates 19 video game development studios worldwide. In July 2011, Glenn Watson, lead programmer of Gameloft's Auckland offshoot, stated that the company's management created a \\"constant sense of urgency\\" at its studio, having employees regularly work 12- to 14-hour days. A new studio in New Orleans was opened in August 2011, taking of advantage of tax breaks granted by the government of Louisiana in July 2009 to establish 150 new jobs. On 29 January 2013, Gameloft's India studio in Hyderabad was closed midway through the workday, leaving 250 people unemployed. Between June and August 2015, Gameloft's Tokyo location made roughly 80 people, effectively being closed. Additionally, on 8 July 2015, all operations at the company's New York City office were halted, and as many as 100 employees were laid off. Shortly after, in September 2015, Gameloft's Seattle studio was closed down and its 15 employees were let go. The studio was opened just a year prior to its closure. Seven studios were closed in total in 2015. Guillemot stated that these actions were taken to accommodate its \\"ambitious cost reduction program\\", instantiated after the company saw a net loss of in the fiscal year that ended on 30 June 2015. In January 2016, Gameloft opened a Nigerian marketing office for regional expansions, however, shut down its Auckland studio, firing roughly 160 employees. At the time, Gameloft Auckland was New Zealand's largest video game studio. Gameloft's Valencia, Spain location was shuttered in April 2016. In July 2017, Gameloft appointed John-Paul Burke as country manager for its subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Gameloft UK later closed in December 2019. = Services = In October 2019, Gameloft announced a partnership with mobile operator Telecom Italia to open TIM I Love Games, a games subscription service for Android and iOS, exclusive to Italy and TIM Italy customers.

The church is located a few kilometres north of the centre of the village of Rollag. Rollag stavkirke (Riksantikvarens Stavkirke) History Rollag Stave Church was probably originally built in second half of the 12th century. It was first mentioned in written sources in 1425. Rollag Stave Church is decorated with a mixture of artistic expressions from a series of periods from the early Middle Ages. The church has been remodeled several times with not much left of the original building. Originally, the church had been a simple church with a rectangular nave. It was rebuilt around 1660 into a cruciform church. A new apse was added in 1666. This choir was replaced and enlarged in 1670. The transept was constructed in 1697‚Äì1698. A gallery was added in 1702. The sacristy was rebuilt in 1739. Around 1760, an additional lining wall was placed on top of the structure and the church was extended to the west. A Baroque pulpit was added in 1763. Architect and art historian Herman Major Schirmer conducted surveys of Rollag Stave Church in 1911 while he chaired the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments. Rollag Stave Church underwent restoration work in 1932.

Drescher is a scientist in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), and author of multiple books on AI, including Made-Up Minds: A Constructivist Approach to Artificial Intelligence. His book describes a theory of how a computer program might be implemented to learn and use new concepts that have not been programmed into it. It introduces the Schema Mechanism, a general learning and concept-building mechanism inspired by Jean Piaget's account of human cognitive development. The Schema Mechanism is intended to replicate key aspects of cognitive development during infancy. It takes Piaget's theory of human development as source of inspiration for an artificial learning mechanism; and it extends and tests Piaget's theory by seeing whether a specific mechanism that works according to Piagetian themes actually exhibits Piagetian abilities. In 2001 and 2002, Drescher was a Visiting Fellow at the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University, which is directed by the American philosopher Daniel Dennett. Following his work at Tufts, he wrote the 2006 book Good and Real: Demystifying Paradoxes from Physics to Ethics, in which he defends a rigorously mechanistic materialism. In this book, he discusses quantum mechanics, defending the Everett or Multiple Worlds Interpretation, against the dominant Copenhagen Interpretation. Among other things, he argues that the Everett Interpretation of quantum mechanics, allows for a completely determinist outlook, and it undermines the views of those (like Roger Penrose) who hold that quantum mechanics can give us some special insights into the nature of consciousness. In this book, Drescher also provides treatments of the Prisoner's Dilemma and Newcomb's Problem in order to build a defense of the golden rule and Kant's categorical imperative which does not require that we posit anything beyond the physical world as understood by the natural sciences.

The firm is involved in the modern form of hawala, an informal value transfer system and remittance method. By 2001, Al-Barakat had outlets in 40 countries, and was the country's largest private employer. It handled about $140 million USD a year from the Somali diaspora, and also offered phone and internet services. After the 9/11 attacks in United States, the US government listed Al-Barakat as a terrorist entity, seized its assets, and detained several people associated with the company. The firm's shut down placed an enormous strain on Somalia's economy, as a majority of residents were dependent on remittances sent by relatives based abroad. In 2006, the US and UN officially removed Al-Barakat from their blacklists, finding that there was no evidence of the company's involvement in funding of any terrorist activities. In 2014, a ceremony was held to mark the relaunching of the firm. As of 20 October 2018 the Al-Barakat group of companies is sanctioned by the US Office of Foreign Assets Controls, and remains on the US watchlists. https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=379 On 12th February 2020, Barakaat Group of companies were entirely removed from the sanctions list by U.S Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). This deletion completes a long process of delistings that spanned two decades and begun at the UN Sanctions Committee to finally conclude in early 2020 at OFAC for owners, executives, and member companies of the group. Establishment Somali women at a social event for the relaunched Al-Barakaat, 2014. Al-Barakat first began operations in 1986. It rose to prominence after the start of the civil war in Somalia in 1991, when money transfer business, known as hawalas, had become the only way for expat Somalis to send funds to their relatives in the absence of a formal banking system. Hawalas is an ancient money transfer system, which uses gold, fuel, foodstuffs and electronics as a way of balancing the books between operators (hawaladas) in different nations. Migrant workers can send money home to relatives by depositing money with a local hawalada, who then instructs an agent to hand over the money in the recipient's country of residence. Post 9/11 shutdown After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the effects of anti-terrorist financing measures of the US government and other participating countries were disastrous for Al-Barakat. The Al-Barakat network subsequently came under attack,https://www.un.org/sc/committees/1267/NSQIJ4101E.shtml as the US government claimed that hawala brokers may have helped fund terrorist activities by funneling millions of dollars from the United States to the terrorist organizations, including Al-Qaeda. Shortly afterwards in 2001, the US authorities shut down Al-Barakat Bank's overseas money remittance channel, labeled the bank \\"the quartermasters of terror\\", and listed it as a terrorist entity. However, despite numerous investigations, nothing was found to link Al-Barakat to terrorist activities as was outlined by the 9/11 Commission. By early 2003, only four criminal prosecutions had been filed and none involved charges of aiding terrorists. The 9/11 Commission Report later confirmed that the bulk of the funds used to finance the assault on the Twin Towers were not sent through the hawala system, but rather by inter-bank wire transfer to the SunTrust Bank in Florida. Nevertheless, the Al-Barakat network was severely impacted, and millions of Somalis were still cut off from funds transferred to their relatives that remained frozen pending conversion of the UN blacklisting. Additionally, several captives that were housed in extrajudicial detention in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camps in Cuba were held because Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO) intelligence analysts asserted that they had some kind of connection to Al-Barakat. Among these captives were Mohammed Sulaymon Barre and Ilkham Turdbyavich Batayev. Removal from the terror lists Weaknesses in the case attempting to associate Al-Barakat with terrorist groups emerged early on, after thorough investigations were carried out in the firm's headquarters and branches. The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission, which was set up on November 27, 2002, \\"to prepare a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks\\", including preparedness for and the immediate response to the attacks, cited no direct evidence that Al-Barakat was involved in terrorist funding. Additionally, the FBI agent who had led the second U.S. delegation said diligent investigation in the UAE revealed no \\"smoking gun\\" evidence ‚Äî either testimonial or documentary ‚Äî showing that Al-Barakat was funding AIAI or al-Qaeda. In fact, the U.S. team could find no direct evidence at all of any real link between Al-Barakat and terrorism of any type. The two major claims, that Bin Ladin was an early investor in Al-Barakat and that the firm diverted a certain portion of its money through its system to AIAI or Al-Qaeda, could not be verified. Jumale and all the Al-Barakat witnesses denied any ties to al-Qaeda or AIAI, and none of the financial evidence the investigators examined directly contradicted these claims. Moreover, some of the claims made by the early intelligence, such as the assertion that Jumale and Bin Ladin were in Afghanistan together, proved to be wrong.http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/staff_statements/911_TerrFin_Ch5.pdf In October 2009, Al-Barakat's Swedish branch was removed from the United Nations' list of terrorist organizations. The company had been on the list for the past eight years, and had had its bank account funds frozen. According to the Swedish Public Radio broadcaster SR, the UN did not explain why it had elected to remove Al-Barakat from its terror list. However, it has been suggested that the change in the European Union's position regarding the many organizations that were included on the UN terror list on weak grounds might have influenced the UN's position. Al-Barakat was subsequently able again to access its bank account funds.al-Barakat has been removed from terror list Stockholm News, October 26, 2009 On 17th Feb 2012, all of the Al-Barakat companies were finally removed entirely. The case against the firm was also closed, as it was delisted by the UN Security Council al-Qaida Sanctions Committee. The delisting included Al-Barakat group of companies owner and CEO Mr. Ahmed Nur Jim'ale, along with all of the 17 listed entities associated with Al-Barakat Group of Companies. Among the latter were Barakat Bank of Somalia, Al-Barakat Exchange and Barakat Telecommunications Company. On 30 June 2016, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) completely removed Mr. Ahmed Nur Jim'ale from its listing and this completes the cycle of delisting process of Al Barakaat Group owner from International Sanctioning bodies. Further, on 12th February 2020, OFAC delisted All Barakaat related companies as well as the last listed executive from this group of companies Mr. KAHIE, Abdullahi Hussein. https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/OFAC- Enforcement/Pages/20200212.aspx Relaunch In 2014, a ceremony was held to mark the relaunching of the Al-Barakat firm.

It was probably written between 1587 and 1593, and was first published in 1594. The story focuses on the classical figure of Dido, the Queen of Carthage. It tells an intense dramatic tale of Dido and her fanatical love for Aeneas (induced by Cupid), Aeneas' betrayal of her and her eventual suicide on his departure for Italy. The playwrights relied on Books 1, 2, and 4 of Virgil's Aeneid as primary source. Characters *Dido ‚Äì Queen of Carthage *Aeneas ‚Äì a Trojan royal hero, son of Anchises and the goddess Venus *Ascanius ‚Äì son of Aeneas *Iarbas ‚Äì King of Gaetulia who is in love with Dido *Achates ‚Äì friend of Aeneas *Ilioneus - Greek Slave *Cloanthus *Sergestus - Commander of the Five armies *Anna ‚Äì Dido's sister *Jupiter *Ganymede *Cupid *Mercury *Venus *Juno *A Lord *A Nurse - Dido's widowed elderly nurse *other Trojans and Carthaginians *servants and attendants  Source  Dido is based on books 1, 2 and 4 of The Aeneid, but the author makes several deviations from this material. Pigman draws attention to how imitators 'exploit... the historical distance between a text and its model', leading to 'crucial departures from, sometimes criticisms of, the model'. Stump suggests that these changes in Dido, Queen of Carthage make a mockery of Aeneas. They notably include: * Dido steals Aeneas's oars, preventing him from leaving. * Aeneas dresses like a beggar, and is unrecognisable when he first arrives. * Aeneas reacts violently to recollections of Troy, and is mad with grief over its loss. * Aeneas is forced to beg Iarbus for help to space. * Anna and Iarbus commit suicide. Plot Jupiter is fondling Ganymede, who says that Jupiter's wife Juno has been mistreating him because of her jealousy. Venus enters, and complains that Jupiter is neglecting her son Aeneas, who has left Troy with survivors of the defeated city. Aeneas was on his way to Italy, but is now lost in a storm. Jupiter tells her not to worry; he will quiet the storm. Venus travels to Libya, where she disguises herself as a mortal and meets Aeneas, who has arrived, lost, on the coast. He and a few followers have become separated from their comrades. He recognises her, but she denies her identity. She helps him meet up with Illioneus, Sergestus and Cloanthes, other surviving Trojans who have already received generous hospitality from the local ruler Dido, Queen of Carthage. Dido meets Aeneas and promises to supply his ships. She asks him to give her the true story of the fall of Troy, which he does in detail, describing the death of Priam, the loss of his own wife and his escape with his son Ascanius and other survivors. Dido's suitor, Iarbas, presses her to agree to marry him. She seems to favour him, but Venus has other plans. She disguises Cupid as Aeneas's son Ascanius, so that he can get close to Dido and touch her with his arrow. He does so; Dido immediately falls in love with Aeneas and rejects Iarbas out of hand, to his horror and confusion. Dido's sister Anna, who is in love with Iarbas, encourages Dido to pursue Aeneas. Dido and Aeneas meet at a cave, where Dido declares her love. They enter the cave to make love. Iarbas swears he will get revenge. Venus and Juno appear, arguing over Aeneas. Venus believes that Juno wants to harm her son, but Juno denies it, saying she has important plans for him. Aeneas's followers say they must leave Libya, to fulfil their destiny in Italy. Aeneas seems to agree, and prepares to depart. Dido sends Anna to find out what is happening. She brings Aeneas back, who denies he intended to leave. Dido forgives him, but as a precaution removes all the sails and tackle from his ships. She also places Ascanius in the custody of the Nurse, believing that Aeneas will not leave without him. However, \\"Ascanius\\" is really the disguised Cupid. Dido says that Aeneas will be king of Carthage and anyone who objects will be executed. Aeneas agrees and plans to build a new city to rival Troy and strike back at the Greeks. Mercury appears with the real Ascanius (a.k.a. Cupid) and informs Aeneas that his destiny is in Italy and that he must leave on the orders of Jupiter. Aeneas reluctantly accepts the divine command. Iarbas sees the opportunity to be rid of his rival and agrees to supply Aeneas with the missing tackle. Aeneas tells Dido he must leave. She pleads with him to ignore Jupiter's command, but he refuses to do so. He departs, leaving Dido in despair. The Nurse says that \\"Ascanius\\" has disappeared. Dido orders her to be imprisoned. She tells Iarbas and Anna that she intends to make a funeral pyre on which she will burn everything that reminds her of Aeneas. After cursing Aeneas' progeny, she throws herself into the fire. Iarbas, horrified, kills himself too. Anna, seeing Iarbas dead, kills herself. Publication The play was first published in 1594, a year after Marlowe's untimely death in Deptford, by the widow Orwin for the bookseller Thomas Woodcock, in Paul's Churchyard. The title page attributes the play to Marlowe and Nashe, and also states that the play was acted by the Children of the Chapel. That company of boy actors stopped regular dramatic performance in 1584, but appears to have engaged in at least sporadic performances in the late 1580s and early 1590s, so that scholars give a range of 1587‚Äì93 for the first performance of Dido.Logan and Smith, pp. 24‚Äì6. Authorship The nineteenth-century scholar Frederick Gard Fleay attempted to delineate the collaborators' respective shares in the text, and assigned to Nashe these portions ‚Äì Act I, scene i (second part, after line 122); Act III, scenes i, ii, and iv; Act IV, scenes i, ii, and v; ‚Äî and the rest to Marlowe.Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 426. However, subsequent critics have not concurred in this assessment, most notably the investigations of Knutowski, R.B. McKerrow, and Tucker Brooke found very little that they felt could be credited to Nashe. While Frederick S. Boas admitted a few details had parallels in Nashe's published works and some words or meanings are found in Nashe's works but not otherwise used by Marlowe, \\"the scenes in which these passages and phrases appear have, as a whole, the stamp of Marlowe.\\"Boas, Christopher Marlowe: A biographical and critical study (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1940), p.51 Some critics have virtually ignored the participation of Nashe ‚Äî yet the presence of a collaborator may help to explain the play's divergences from Marlowe's standard dramaturgy. No other play by Marlowe has such a strong female lead character, and in no other \\"is heteroerotic passion the centripetal force of the drama's momentum.\\"Sara Munson Deats, in Cheney, p. 194. Adaptations The 18th-century English composer Stephen Storace wrote an opera titled Dido, Queen of Carthage (1794) ‚Äî alleged, by his sister Anna (Nancy) Storace, for whom the title role was written, to have been his greatest work ‚Äì which largely set Marlowe's play to music. It was also the only one of Storace's works to have been completely sung throughout, with no spoken dialogue. However, the work was never published, as Storace's impresario Richard Brinsley Sheridan wished to retain control over productions of it. A single copy was kept at the Drury Lane Theatre, to prevent pirated versions appearing elsewhere ‚Äì and the opera is presumed to have been lost in the 1809 Drury Lane Theatre fire, since nothing of it has survived. An adaptation of the play was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 30 May 1993, the 400th anniversary of Marlowe's death, along with The Massacre at Paris, directed by Alan Drury and Michael Earley and featuring Sally Dexter as Dido, Timothy Walker as Aeneas, Jeremy Blake as Iarbas, Ben Thomas as Achates, Teresa Gallagher as Anna/Juno and Andrew Wincott as Cupid.http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/06efc8ab1f3f4967adf6dccd16294dcc Notes References * Chambers, E.

The university is ranked by Times Higher Education among the best in Turkey. World University Rankings  History  Anadolu University was created in 1982 from the union of four existing higher education institutes in Eski≈üehir: the Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences of Eski≈üehir, the State Academy of Architecture and Engineering, the Institute of Education, and a medical school. As the Academy of Economics and Commercial Sciences was founded earliest (in 1958), Anadolu University has adopted that year as their date of establishment.  Campus  Most of Anadolu University's faculties and schools, including the Open Education Faculty, are located at the Yunusemre Campus in the centre of Eski≈üehir. The Yunusemre Campus also contains student housing, Anadolu's university hospital, and most of the university's administration buildings. Ikieylul Campus, just outside Eski≈üehir's city centre, houses the School of Physical Education and Sports, the Faculty of Engineering and Architecture, and the School of Civil Aviation, along with the associated Anadolu University Airport. In addition to these two campuses, the Porsuk Vocational School is located separately in Eski≈üehir, the Bilecik Vocational School in Bilecik, the Boz√ºy√ºk Vocational School in Boz√ºy√ºk. To serve its distance education students, Anadolu University operates 88 administrative centres, or bureaus, in urban areas throughout Turkey, many of which offer academic counselling and optional evening classes. Distance Education The Higher Education Act of 1981 nominated Anadolu University as the national provider of distance education, upon which it has placed strong emphasis since its creation in 1982. The university's goal is to educate Turks who live in rural areas and others \\"who do not have the time or resources to enroll in conventional schools.\\" This effort has been largely successful, as enrollment in open education programs has increased from under 30,000 in 1982-83 to over 870,000 in 2005-06 and is now also available to Turkish communities in Northern Cyprus and the European Union. Programs offered via distance education include 4-year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees in Economics and in Business Administration and nineteen 2-year associate degrees in a variety of fields. Anadolu University has received a mandate from the Turkish Ministry of National Education to educate Turkey's preschool and English language teachers and does so by distance education, though students in the latter program are also required to take two years of in-person classes. Anadolu University and SUNY Empire State College offered distance education eMBA degree from 2005 to 2010. Courses are delivered by a variety of methods, including pre-recorded television and radio broadcasts, videoconferences, and via internet. Students can also access academic counseling or attend optional evening classes at some of the Anadolu University bureaus located throughout Turkey.

individuals dedicated to preserving the ecologically sensitive Oak Ridges Moraine in Ontario, Canada. Formed in 1989, its primary goal has been to lobby the Government of Ontario to create legislation to protect the moraine. The coalition was founded when two groups (one from Peterborough that was supporting a group in Durham Region, and one in King Township) discovered that they had the same name (STORM), and networked with other local groups to organize a first coalition meeting. The brief that the Peterborough group prepared had a significant impact on the Environmental Assessment Advisory Committee who held a hearing to hear perspectives on the disputed land use proposal near Kendall in Durham. STORM has played an important role in triggering political action to preserve the Oak Ridges Moraine. Soon after its formation, it raised the profile of the Moraine at both the local and provincial levels, causing the provincial government to declare an \\"expression of provincial interest\\" in the Moraine in 1990. STORM was appointed as a member of the government-sponsored Oak Ridges Moraine Technical Working Committee. In addition to STORM, membership on the committee included: Regional Municipalities of Durham, Peel and York, MNR, MMAH, MOE, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (TRCA), Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority (GRCA), Conservation Council of Ontario (CCO), Urban Development Institute (UDI), Aggregate Producers Association of Ontario (APAO), and Federation of Ontario Naturalists (FON). The committee operated from 19911994. Its task was to develop a long-term preservation strategy for the moraine. The committee's final report, submitted to the province in 1994, was never implemented. Instead, the province expanded the powers of the municipalities in administration of the lands that were the subject of the committee's report.Hunter Geographic Information Systems (November 30, 2001).

It is a modern adaptation of freighting, in which dogs were used as freight animals to move cargo. Many breeds participate in this sport, with dogs being separated into classes by weight. Sled dog and bull breeds excel within their respective weight classes, having been historically bred to pull sleds and carts as working dogs, respectively. The dog is hitched to the cart or sled with a specially constructed harness designed to spread the weight and minimize the chance of injury. Since IWPA's organization in 1984, no dogs have been hurt in competition. Dog weight pulling competitions are sanctioned by various non-profit organizations. In North America the International Sled Dog Racing Association has sanctioned contests in association with their races. The International Weight Pulling Association was organized in 1984 to promote the heritage of the working dog. IWPA operates in North America. Since 2000, the American Pulling Alliance has also offered sanctioned competitions in North America as well as Europe. The United Kennel Club also includes Weight Pull as one of their dog sports. Alaskan Malamute Clubs in the UK, and Australia offer sanctioned weight pull competitions based on the Alaskan Malamute Club of America's weight pull rules. Other breed clubs also offer weight pull, such as American Dog Breeders Association. In the 2010s other organizations started offering sanctioned competitions, such as National Working Dog Association. In 2012, GPA (Global Pulling Alliance) was formed to focus on educating the general public about the sport of weight pulling as a positive outlet for active canines across the globe. GPA holds competitions in 6 countries; United Kingdom, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Philippines, Ireland, and the United States, and continues to add to their list as the sport grows in popularity. Other organizations are springing up in Europe and Asia as the sport becomes increasingly more popular. Bulgaria also has started to promote the sport by a club called Weight Pulling & Sporting Dogs Bulgaria. Since 2014 Lithuania has a dog weight pulling club called \\"Weight Pulling Lithuania\\".

A flatulist, fartist, or professional farter is an entertainer often associated with a specific type of humor, whose routine consists solely or primarily of passing gas in a creative, musical, or amusing manner.Le P√©tomane:The Strange Life of a \\"Fartiste\\" History There are a number of scattered references to ancient and medieval flatulists, who could produce various rhythms and pitches with their intestinal wind. Saint Augustine in City of God (De Civitate Dei) (14.24) mentions some performers who did have \\"such command of their bowels, that they can break wind continuously at will, so as to produce the effect of singing.\\" Juan Luis Vives, in his 1522 commentary to Augustine's work, testifies to having himself witnessed such a feat, a remark referenced by Michel de Montaigne in an essay. The professional farters of medieval Ireland were called braigeto√≠r. They are listed together with other performers and musicians in the 12th century Tech Midch√∫arda, a diagram of the banqueting hall of Tara. As entertainers, these braigetoir ranked at the lower end of a scale headed by bards, fili, and harpers. One late medieval flatulist is mentioned in an entry in the 13th-century English Liber Feodorum or Book of Fees. It lists one Roland the Farter, who held Hemingstone manor in the county of Suffolk, for which he was obliged to perform \\"Unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum\\" (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) annually at the court of King Henry II every Christmas. The Activa Vita character in the 14th century allegorical poem Piers Plowman appears to number farting among the abilities desirable in a good entertainer in general, alongside storytelling, fiddling, or playing the harp.Peter Meredith, \\"The professional travelling players of the fifteenth century: myth or reality?\\" European Medieval Drama 2 (1998) 21-34. DOI 10.1484/J.EMD.2.300900 This poem translates to \\"As for me, I can neither drum nor trumpet, nor tell jokes, nor fart amusingly at parties, nor play the harp.\\" In Japan, during the Edo period, flatulists were known as \\"heppiri otoko\\" (ÊîæÂ±ÅÁî∑), lit. \\"farting men.\\" Also see He-gassen (Â±ÅÂêàÊà¶) for Edo-period art scrolls depicting \\"farting competitions\\".

One of the most prominent of these was the 1994‚Äì1995 pilgrimage from Auschwitz to Hiroshima by way of Bosnia, Iraq, Cambodia and other countries then experiencing the effects of war. That pilgrimage was known as The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life. A more recent walk was the 2010 Walk for a Nuclear Free Future, a walk across the United States in support of a nuclear-free future. Many argue that the order shows a certain political stance with its active opposition to the nuclear industry in Japan and U.S involvement in Okinawa.

He was one of the most radical and colourful figures in the politics of colonial Victoria, and made the most determined efforts to break the power of the Victorian Legislative Council, the stronghold of the landowning class. Early years Berry was born in Twickenham, near London, where his father, Benjamin Berry, was a licensed victualler. He had a primary education until 11 years old, then became an apprentice draper. In 1848 he married Harriet Ann Blencowe, with whom he had eleven children. Migration In 1852 he migrated to Victoria, and went into business as a grocer in Prahran, then as a general storekeeper in South Yarra. His business skills and Victoria's booming economy soon made him a wealthy man. After his first wife's death he married Rebekah Evans in 1871; the couple had seven children of their own. At his death, Berry was survived by eight of the children from his first marriage and all seven of the children from his second marriage. In Victoria, Berry, by voracious reading, acquired the education he had missed in England, and taught himself economics, literature and philosophy. But all his life he retained a broad London accent, which many Victorian conservatives found offensive or amusing. In Parliament he once asked the Speaker: \\"What is now before the 'Ouse?\\" To which the Leader of the Opposition interjected: \\"An H!\\" He developed a powerful rhetorical style modelled on that of his hero Gladstone, equally effective in the rough-house of the colonial Parliament or on the hustings. The conservative newspaper The Argus conceded: \\"His oratory might not be polished: it certainly was not--but it was passionate, and it told.\\" Noted for his humour, Berry was nevertheless a tough and determined politician. Political career Berry was elected to the Legislative Assembly for East Melbourne at a by-election in 1861, as what The Argus called \\"an extreme liberal.\\" At the general election later in the same year he switched to Collingwood, then famously the most radical electorate in the colony. He was re-elected in 1864, but his criticism of James McCulloch's government during the tariff crisis of 1865 led to his defeat in that year's snap election. In 1866 Berry moved to Geelong, where he started a newspaper, the Geelong Register, as a rival to the established Geelong Advertiser. Using the paper as a platform, he was elected for Geelong West in February 1869. In 1877 he switched to Geelong, which he represented until February 1886. He was briefly Treasurer in John MacPherson's government in 1870. When Charles Gavan Duffy formed a strong liberal government in June 1871, Berry again became Treasurer. He was a convinced protectionist, and steered a bill for increased tariffs through the Parliament. = Premier = After the conservative interlude of the Francis and Kerferd governments, Berry assumed leadership of the liberals and became Premier and Treasurer in August 1875. But the liberal majority in the Assembly was unreliable, and in October the government's budget was defeated and Berry resigned. He asked the Governor, Sir George Bowen, for a dissolution, but was refused. He then campaigned across the colony in opposition to the third McCulloch government. At the May 1877 election, with the powerful backing of the Melbourne Age under David Syme, he won a huge liberal majority in the Assembly and returned to office at the head of a radical ministry. Berry's election manifesto proposed a punitive land tax designed to break up the squatter class's great pastoral properties ‚Äì about 800 men at this time owned most of Victoria's grazing lands. He also advocated a high tariff to foster local manufacturing, which threatened to harm the importing and banking interests. He promised that if the Council, which was elected on a limited property-based franchise, blocked his program, it would be \\"dealt with according to its deserts.\\" He described the Council as \\"a chamber which robs the people of the gold in the soil and the land God gave them.\\" Given that there was no mechanism in the Victorian Constitution to override the Council, this was taken by conservatives to be a threat of revolutionary violence. Berry was a devoted constitutional liberal and had no plans for illegal measures. But the Councillors were sufficiently alarmed to pass a modified version of Berry's land tax bill, despite the urgings of the ultra-conservative former Premier Sir Charles Sladen to reject it outright. Berry, emboldened, next introduced a bill for the payment of members of the Assembly, which the trade unions were demanding so that working class candidates could be elected. Berry \\"tacked\\" the bill to the Appropriation Bill so that Council could not reject it without paralysing the Colony's finances. The Council resented this blackmail and at Sladen's urging declined to pass the bill, laying it aside. At Trove With the two Houses deadlocked, Berry embarked on a public campaign of \\"coercion\\" against the Council. \\"We coerce madmen\\", he said, \\"We put them into lunatic asylums, and never was anything more the act of madmen than the rejection of the Appropriation Bill.\\" To bring matters to a head, on 8 January 1878 (\\"Black Wednesday\\") Berry's government began to dismiss public servants, starting with police and judges, arguing that without an Appropriation Bill they could not be paid. Berry next brought in a bill to strip the Council of its powers, which the Council of course rejected. For the next two years Berry clung to office while the colony was gripped with class conflict, including huge torchlit processions through Melbourne sponsored by The Age (pro-Berry) and The Argus (anti-Berry) ‚Äì although, remarkably, there was almost no violence. Almost no legislation was passed and the administration ground to a halt as funds ran out. Berry's next tactic was to pass a bill through the Assembly stating that finance bills did not need to be passed by the Council, but would become law when passed by the Assembly. Bowen thought this bill unconstitutional, but signed it on Berry's advice. When the Colonial Office learned of this, Bowen was recalled and the bill overturned. An obituary illustration of Sir Graham Berry Finally a compromise was reached, the payment of members bill was passed, and the sacked public servants were reinstated. Berry then introduced another bill to reduce the powers of the Council. When this was rejected, he decided to appeal directly to London. In 1879 Berry and another leading liberal, Charles Pearson, travelled to London to try to persuade the British Government to amend the Victorian Constitution in such a way as to reduce the power of the Council. Unfortunately for them, the Conservatives under Benjamin Disraeli were in power, and the Colonial Secretary, Sir Michael Hicks-Beach, refused to agree to Berry's requests. Returning to Melbourne empty-handed, Berry was welcomed by huge crowds, but the popularity of his government was declining and his majority in the Assembly was crumbling under the strain of the crisis. He tried to pass another bill to amend the Constitution, but in December 1879 it failed by one vote to gain the necessary two-thirds in the Assembly. Berry then resigned, and at the subsequent election he was very narrowly defeated. The conservatives under James Service formed a weak government, which resigned in June 1880, leading to another election, which the liberals won, though not as convincingly as they had done in 1877. Berry returned as Premier, and formed a much more moderate ministry than the one which had fallen in 1879. Both sides were exhausted by the struggle, and in July 1881 a modest reform bill was passed, including some reforms of Council elections, but no concessions on the essential powers of the Council. Berry, feeling he could do no more, resigned, and Bryan O'Loghlen formed another weak conservative government. Later Berry accepted office as Chief Secretary and Postmaster-General in a coalition government led by Service, from 1883 to 1886. Later years In 1886 Berry resigned from Parliament and was appointed Victorian Agent-General in London, then an important and prestigious post. He was also appointed Executive Commissioner to the Colonial and Indian Exhibition, for his services in connection with which he was created K.C.M.G., becoming Sir Graham Berry. He was lionised as a liberal hero in London. Berry was one of the representatives of Victoria at the Colonial Conference held in London in 1887, and took a prominent part in its proceedings. For his services in connection with the Paris Exhibition of 1889 he was appointed a Commander of the Legion of Honour by the French Government. Berry was also awarded the Order of the Crown of Italy. Although he was now 70, he was not yet done with politics. Returning to Melbourne in 1892, just as the great post-gold rush economic boom was collapsing and the colony entering a severe depression, he was elected for East Bourke Boroughs at the May 1892 elections. He was Treasurer in William Shiels's Liberal government, but the days of reforming liberalism in Victoria were over for the time being and he resigned in January 1893. In October 1894 he was elected Speaker, a post he held until September 1897, when he finally retired. Berry at the 1898 Australasian Federal Convention. Berry was granted a pension by Parliament, and devoted the remainder of his life to supporting the cause of Australian Federation. In 1897 he was elected a Victorian delegate to the Constitutional Convention which drafted the Australian Constitution, mainly because of the support of The Age. At 75, however, he was too frail to contribute much except his prestige as one of the country's liberal heroes. He retired to the seaside with his enormous family, and died at St Kilda in 1904. He was given a state funeral and eulogised by Prime Minister Alfred Deakin. The Age editorialised on Berry's death: \\"Sir Graham Berry had ten years of such storms as might well have daunted one less resolute. But he lived to see the triumph of almost all the great reforms he had fought for.\\" This was not strictly true, since the conservative domination of the Legislative Council lasted unbroken for nearly a century after his death, but Berry certainly deserved to be remembered as the most determined radical politician in 19th century Victoria. Portrayals on screen Berry appears as a minor character in the 2003 film Ned Kelly, played by Australian actor Charles Tingwell.\\"Films on Ned Kelly\\" by Justin Corfield, 2003 Berry is portrayed as receiving Kelly's now famous Jerilderie Letter and reading it out loud to the officers in charge of the hunt, though in reality, Berry was never sent the letter, nor was it ever intended to be sent to him.

The awards have had several previous names, owners and sponsors since being launched in 1990, including the National Book Awards from 2010 to 2014. Book award history The British Book Awards or Nibbies ran from 1990‚Äì2009 and founded by the editor of Publishing News. The award was then acquired by Agile Marketing which renamed it the National Book Awards with headline sponsors Galaxy National Book Awards (2010‚Äì11) (sponsored by Galaxy) and Specsavers National Book Awards (2012‚Äì2014) (sponsored by Specsavers). There were no National Book Awards after 2014. In 2017 the award was acquired by The Bookseller and renamed to the original British Book Awards or Nibbies. In 2005, The Bookseller launched a separate scheme, The Bookseller Retail Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2010, running parallel to the National Book Awards, The Bookseller combined The Nibbies with its retail awards to produce The Bookseller Industry Awards (winners not listed in this article). In 2017 The British Book Industry Awards were renamed as The British Book Awards after it acquired the National Book Awards from Agile Marketing. It is known as the Nibbies because of the golden nib-shaped trophy given to winners.

All of these are variations on the patronym \\"Son of Bartholomew\\": his father's full name was Bartholomeus, a name often shortened to the last part, pronounced \\"Meeuwis\\". Kortenaer was born in 1604 in Groningen of humble origins. In 1626, he was made boatswain, in 1636, second mate. In the First Anglo-Dutch War, he served as first mate in 1652 on the Dutch flagship, Brederode.Kortenaer, Egbert Meeuwszoon in the NNBW In the Battle of Dungeness, he lost his right hand and eye. On 10 April 1653, he was made commandeur to replace flag captain Abel Roelants when Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp used Brederode as his flagship. In the Battle of Scheveningen, Tromp was killed. Kortenaer kept Tromp's standard raised to keep up morale (this was habitual for the Dutch on such occasions) and took command of his squadron. On 21 October 1653, Kortenaer was promoted to captain. In the years after the war, he often commanded squadrons as commodore when flag officers were absent. In the Battle of the Sound (8 November 1658), serving as flag captain on Eendragt, he beat off every Swedish attack while his commanding officer, Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam, was debilitated by gout. After this heroic conduct against the Swedish, Kortenaer was promoted to vice- admiral on 8 May 1659 and knighted by Frederick III of Denmark in the Order of the Elephant. On 29 January 1665, shortly before the Second Anglo-Dutch War, he was made lieutenant-admiral of the Admiralty of de Maze. He wasn't given command of the confederate Dutch fleet because he was a supporter of the House of Orange. A British intelligence report stated, \\"He is the best man they have\\". During the Battle of Lowestoft on 13 June 1665, Kortenaer commanded the van and was second in overall command behind Van Wassenaer. He was fatally wounded early in the battle on Groot Hollandia by a cannonball hitting his hip and buried in Rotterdam in a marble grave memorial engraved with a poem by Gerard Brandt: Kortenaer's grave memorial :The Hero of the Maas, bereft of eye ::and his right hand :Yet of the Wheel the Eye, Fist of ::the Fatherland :KORTENAER the Great, the terror ::of foe's fleets :the forcer of the Sound by this grave ::his country greets Portraits File:Wouter Muller - Egbert Kortenaer, luitenant-admiraal van Holland en West-Friesland, gevallen in de slag bij Lowestoft, 1665 NG-VG-1-969.jpgCommemorative medal by Wouter Muller, 1665 File:Helst, Egbert Kortenaer.jpgLieutenant-Admiral Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, anonymous copy of the Van der Helst portrait, hiding his blind eye File:Admiral Egbert Meeuwisz Kortenaer (1604-1665), after Isaac Mijtens.jpgLieutenant-Admiral Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer (after a painting by Isaac Mijtens) HNLMS Kortenaer Several ships of the Dutch navy have been named Kortenaer after the admiral, * A late-19th century coastal defence ship * The World War II destroyer . * An ex-British S-class destroyer, formerly HMS Scorpion, transferred in 1945 * The lead ship of the s References External links * Category:1604 births Category:1665 deaths Category:17th-century Dutch military personnel Category:Admirals of the navy of the Dutch Republic Category:Dutch military personnel killed in action Category:People from Groningen (city) ","title":"Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer"},{"id":"1895206","text":"Dra≈æen Budi≈°a (; born 25 July 1948) is a retired Croatian politician who used to be leading opposition figure in the 1990s and a two-time presidential candidate. As leader of the Croatian Social Liberal Party through the 1990s he remains to date the only Leader of the Opposition not to have been from either the Croatian Democratic Union or the Social Democratic Party. Biography =During Yugoslavia= Budi≈°a was born in Drni≈°, Croatia, Yugoslavia. He was one of the radical student leaders during the Croatian Spring in the 1970s. For his activities he was later sent to Lepoglava prison by Communist authorities. Before the arrival of democracy he worked as a librarian. In 1989 he was one of the founders of Croatian Social Liberal Party and later its leader. During the 1990 elections his party joined Coalition of People's Accord and fared badly, including Budi≈°a who failed to win a seat. =As leader of opposition= In August 1991, during the war, Budi≈°a became a minister in war-time cabinet of Franjo Greguriƒá. In February 1992, he was the first ministers to break ranks, being opposed to the constitutional laws guaranteeing political autonomy of ethnic Serbs in exchange for their formal recognition of Croatian sovereignty. He announced his decision to resign during televised session of the Croatian Parliament, and thus became rallying point for many Croatians dissatisfied with the policies of Franjo Tuƒëman. Although he lost the presidential election of 1992 to Tuƒëman, he confirmed his status of opposition leader, beating many other, presumably more charismatic leaders like Savka Dabƒçeviƒá-Kuƒçar and Dobroslav Paraga. His HSLS party also fared relatively well at those elections and later had even better results few months later on Chamber of Counties, regional and local elections, when HSLS reached its zenith. In 1995, the united opposition won local elections for Zagreb and HSLS suggested a mayor. However, Franjo Tuƒëman abused his powers - starting the Zagreb Crisis - and blocked four HSLS mayors suggested, including Budi≈°a. This rise of HSLS proved to be short-lived. On the 1995 parliamentary elections many of its voters switched to rejuvenated Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) and a centrist coalition. Still, HSLS remained the strongest opposition party in the lower house of the parliament. Two years later, the dissipation continued on local elections. Budi≈°a reacted by floating plans for coalition government with Tuƒëman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), hoping to attract their voters. This led to a split with Vladimir Gotovac and creation of Liberal Party who opposed the HDZ's right politics. =Coalition with SDP and the new government= After that Budi≈°a finally realised that the only way to get power lies in a broad coalition of all opposition parties, including SDP. He and Ivica Raƒçan signed the coalition agreement in 1998 and convincingly won at the 2000 parliamentary election. This triumph was marred by Budi≈°a losing to Stjepan Mesiƒá on the presidential elections held two weeks later. Budi≈°a, who tried to woo followers of Franjo Tuƒëman during the second round, was embittered by this defeat and this led to his party turning increasingly right-wing and later squabbles with his government coalition partners. This resulted with him resigning from the post of president of HSLS on 12 July 2001 over dispute with SDP about whether to send Croatian generals to ICTY.Veƒçernji list: Budi≈°a dao ostavku! Jozo Rado≈° was chosen to act instead of him.vjesnik.hr: Jozo Rado≈° izabran za vr≈°itelja du≈ænosti predsjednika HSLS-a Budi≈°a was resentful of having no post in the new government and publicly forced Raƒçan to dismiss Goran Graniƒá, the deputy prime minister and HSLS party member in order to put Budi≈°a at that position, at which he remained for only a short time. One of the points on which Budi≈°a clashed with Mesiƒá (and later Raƒçan) was cooperation with ICTY. All this escalated in 2002 when Budi≈°a and his party left the government in an unsuccessful bid to force new elections. The ultimate result was yet another fragmentation of his party and the formation of the Party of Liberal Democrats who supported the government. =Fall from politics= Back in opposition, Budi≈°a first quit his party, and dramatically returned a year later - which was seen as a staged event - and then tried to return to power by forming a centre-right bloc together with the new Democratic Centre of Mate Graniƒá. On 2003 parliamentary elections, this bloc fared badly, winning only three seats, with neither for the two party leaders. Although those three seats later proved crucial in helping Ivo Sanader to form a parliamentary majority, Budi≈°a, like Graniƒá, took responsibility for the disaster and on 17 December 2003 resigned party leadership.index.hr: Budi≈°a podnio neopozivu ostavku na mjesto predsjednika hslsa In 2009 after Darinko Kosor became the HSLS president, Budi≈°a made a short comeback to politics and in the 2011 parliamentary elections he led the HSLS election list as number one in the IX. electoral district but in the elections HSLS didn't manage to win any seats in the parliament for the first time In Croatian parliamentary history. Soon after he left the party and retired from politics.

He is Distinguished Teaching Professor of Philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin, and is currently on phased retirement. He is the author of Free Will and Values (1985), Through the Moral Maze (1994), and The Significance of Free Will (1996: awarded the 1996 Robert W. Hamilton Faculty Book Award). He also edited the Oxford Handbook of Free Will (2004) and has published many articles in the philosophy of mind and action, ethics, the theory of values and philosophy of religion. Education Kane studied philosophy from 1956 to 1960 at Holy Cross College (B.A. 1960), from 1958 to 1959 at the University of Vienna, and from 1960 to 1964 at Yale University (M.A. 1962, Ph.D. 1964).Robert Kane, Curriculum Vitae . University of Texas at Austin. Work =Causal indeterminism= Kane is one of the leading contemporary philosophers on free will.Kane, R. (ed.) Oxford Handbook of Free WillInformation Philosophers \\"Robert Kane is the acknowledged dean of the libertarian philosophers writing actively on the free will problem.\\" Advocating what is termed within philosophical circles \\"libertarian freedom\\", Kane argues that \\"(1) the existence of alternative possibilities (or the agent's power to do otherwise) is a necessary condition for acting freely, and (2) determinism is not compatible with alternative possibilities (it precludes the power to do otherwise)\\".Kane (ed.): Oxford Handbook of Free Will, p. 11. It is important to note that the crux of Kane's position is grounded not in a defense of alternative possibilities (AP) but in the notion of what Kane refers to as ultimate responsibility (UR). Thus, AP is a necessary but insufficient criterion for free will. It is necessary that there be (metaphysically) real alternatives for our actions, but that is not enough; our actions could be random without being in our control. The control is found in \\"ultimate responsibility\\". Ultimate responsibility entails that agents must be the ultimate creators (or originators) and sustainers of their own ends and purposes. There must be more than one way for a person's life to turn out (AP). More importantly, whichever way it turns out must be based in the person's willing actions. As Kane defines it, In short, \\"an agent must be responsible for anything that is a sufficient and necessary reason (condition, cause or motive) for the action's occurring.\\"Kane: \\"Free Will\\" in Free Will, p. 224. What allows for ultimacy of creation in Kane's picture are what he refers to as \\"self-forming actions\\" or SFAs ‚Äî those moments of indecision during which people experience conflicting wills. These SFAs are the undetermined, regress-stopping voluntary actions or refrainings in the life histories of agents that are required for UR. UR does not require that every act done of our own free will be undetermined and thus that, for every act or choice, we could have done otherwise; it requires only that certain of our choices and actions be undetermined (and thus that we could have done otherwise), namely SFAs. These form our character or nature; they inform our future choices, reasons and motivations in action. If a person has had the opportunity to make a character-forming decision (SFA), he is responsible for the actions that are a result of his character. Critique Randolph Clarke objects that Kane's depiction of free will is not truly libertarian but rather a form of compatibilism. The objection asserts that although the outcome of an SFA is not determined, one's history up to the event is; so the fact that an SFA will occur is also determined. The outcome of the SFA is based on chance, and from that point on one's life is determined. This kind of freedom, says Clarke, is no different than the kind of freedom argued for by compatibilists, who assert that even though our actions are determined, they are free because they are in accordance with our own wills, much like the outcome of an SFA. Kane responds that the difference between causal indeterminism and compatibilism is \\"ultimate control ‚Äî the originative control exercised by agents when it is 'up to them' which of a set of possible choices or actions will now occur, and up to no one and nothing else over which the agents themselves do not also have control\\".Kane: \\"Free Will\\" in Free Will, p. 243. UR assures that the sufficient conditions for one's actions do not lie before one's own birth. In his book defending compatibilism, Freedom Evolves, Daniel Dennett spends a chapter criticising Kane's theory.Dennett, D. Freedom Evolves.Viking Books, February, 2003 Kane believes freedom is based on certain rare and exceptional events, which he calls self-forming actions or SFA's. Dennett notes that there is no guarantee such an event will occur in an individual's life. If it does not, the individual does not in fact have free will at all, according to Kane. Yet they will seem the same as anyone else. Dennett finds an essentially indetectable notion of free will to be incredible. =Radical libertarianism= Kane is one of several philosophers and scientists to propose a two-stage model of free will. The American philosopher William James was the first (in 1884). Others include the French mathematician and scientist Henri Poincar√© (about 1906), the physicist Arthur Holly Compton (1931, 1955), the philosopher Karl Popper (1965, 1977), the physicist and philosopher Henry Margenau (1968, 1982), the philosopher Daniel Dennett (1978), the classicists A. A. Long and David Sedley (1987), the philosopher Alfred Mele (1995), and most recently, the neurogeneticist and biologist Martin Heisenberg (2009), son of the physicist Werner Heisenberg, whose quantum indeterminacy principle lies at the foundation of indeterministic physics.Two-stage models of free will Kane's model goes beyond Daniel Dennett's by trying to keep indeterminism as late as possible in the process of deliberation, indeed as late as the decision itself in the SFAs (Self-Forming Actions). Kane's followers, Laura Waddell Ekstrom, Richard Double, and Mark Balaguer, as well as the philosopher Peter van Inwagen, agree that chance must be the direct cause of action. This makes them all radical libertarians, as opposed to those who limit chance to the early deliberative stages of the decision process, such as James, Popper, Margenau, Doyle and Martin Heisenberg, who are conservative or modest libertarians, following the two-stage models proposed by Dennett and Mele. In his 1985 book Free Will and Values, aware of earlier proposals by neurobiologist John Eccles, Popper, and Dennett, but working independently, Kane proposed an ambitious amplifier model for a quantum randomizer in the brain - a spinning wheel of fortune with probability bubbles corresponding to alternative possibilities, in the massive switch amplifier (MSA) tradition of Compton. He says > What I would like to do then, is to show how an MSA model, using Eccles' > notion of critically poised neurons as a working hypothesis, might be > adapted to the theory of practical, moral and prudential decision > making.Free Will and Values, p.169 But Kane was not satisfied with his solution. In the end he did not endorse it. He said it did not go far enough because it does not fully capture the notion of ultimate responsibility (UR) during rare \\"self-forming actions (SFAs). It is merely a \\"significant piece in the overall puzzle of a libertarian freedom.\\" Free Will and Values, p.104 He explains that the main reason for failure is > \\"locating the master switch and the mechanism of amplification ... We do not > know if something similar goes on in the brains of cortically developed > creatures like ourselves, but I suspect it must if libertarian theories are > to succeed.\\" ibid, p.168Where and When is Randomness Located? on Information > Philosopher Kane admits his basic failure is his location of indeterminism in the decision process itself. This makes chance the direct cause of action. He was actually quite bleak about the possibilities for a satisfactory libertarian model. He felt > \\"that any construction which escaped confusion and emptiness was likely to > fall short of some libertarian aspirations - aspirations that I believe > cannot ultimately be fulfilled.\\" ibid, p.165 But Kane claims that the major criticism of all indeterminist libertarian models is explaining the power to choose or do otherwise in \\"exactly the same conditions,\\" something he calls \\"dual rational self-control.\\" Given that A was the rational choice, how can one defend doing B under exactly the same circumstances?\\" ibid, p. 59 Kane is concerned that such a \\"dual power\\" is arbitrary, capricious, and irrational. Kane's latest suggestion for his occasional self-forming actions argues that the tension and uncertainty in our minds stirs up \\"chaos\\" that is sensitive to micro-indeterminacies at the neuronal level. > All free acts do not have to be undetermined on the libertarian view, but > only those acts by which we made ourselves into the kinds of persons we are, > namely the \\"will-setting\\" or \\"self-forming actions\\" (SFAs) that are required > for ultimate responsibility. Four Views on Free Will, p. 26 > Now I believe these undetermined self-forming actions or SFAs occur at those > difficult times of life when we are torn between competing visions of what > we should do or become. Perhaps we are torn between doing the moral thing or > acting from ambition, or between powerful present desires and long-term > goals, or we are faced with difficult tasks for which we have > aversions.ibid, p. 26 Since he is primarily interested in cases of \\"liberty of indifference,\\" the strong indeterminism he introduces raise the objection of loss of agent control, but Kane says the agent can beforehand decide to assume responsibility whichever way she randomly chose. This seems more like rationalization than reason, but Kane defends it. > \\"Suppose we were to say to such persons: 'But look, you didn't have > sufficient or conclusive prior reasons for choosing as you did since you > also had viable reasons for choosing the other way.' They might reply. 'True > enough. But I did have good reasons for choosing as I did, which I'm willing > to stand by and take responsibility for.

It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes in Egypt. The area was used as the sixth nome of Upper Egypt, south of Abydos. Description The compound's massive mudbrick walls, as seen from the temple roof The whole complex covers some 40,000 square meters and is surrounded by a hefty mudbrick enclosed wall. Dendera was inhabited in prehistory, a useful oasis on the banks of the Nile. It seems that pharaoh Pepi I (ca. 2250 BC) built on this site and evidence exists of a temple in the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca 1500 BC). The earliest extant building in the compound today is the mammisi raised by Nectanebo II ‚Äì last of the native pharaohs (360‚Äì343 BC). The features in the complex include: * Hathor temple (the main temple) * Temple of the birth of Isis * Sacred Lake * Sanatorium * Mammisi of Nectanebo II * Christian Basilica * Roman Mammisi * a Barque shrine * Gateways of Domitian and Trajan * the Roman Kiosk Nearby is the Dendera necropolis, a series of mastaba tombs. The necropolis dates from the Early Dynastic Period of the Old Kingdom to the First Intermediate Period of Egypt. The necropolis runs the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain. Hathor temple Plan of Hathor Temple \\"Gate of Domitian and Trajan\\" northern entrance of the Temple of Hathor, in Dendera, Egypt. Roman Emperor Trajan as a Pharaoh making an offering to the Gods, in Dendera, Egypt. The dominant building in the complex is the Temple of Hathor. The temple has been modified on the same site starting as far back as the Middle Kingdom, and continuing right up until the time of the Roman emperor Trajan. The existing structure began construction in the late Ptolemaic period at the time of Ptolemy Auletes in July 54 BCE. and the hypostyle hall was built in the Roman period under Tiberius. In Egypt, Trajan was quite active in constructing buildings and decorating them. He appears, together with Domitian, in offering scenes on the propylon of the Temple of Hathor. His cartouche also appears in the column shafts of the Temple of Khnum at Esna.\\"Trajan was, in fact, quite active in Egypt. Separate scenes of Domitian and Trajan making offerings to the gods appear on reliefs on the propylon of the Temple of Hathor at Dendera. There are cartouches of Domitian and Trajan on the column shafts of the Temple of Knum at Esna, and on the exterior a frieze text mentions Domitian, Trajan, and Hadrian\\" Layout elements of the temple are: * Large Hypostyle Hall * Small Hypostyle Hall * Laboratory * Storage magazine * Offering entry * Treasury * Exit to well * Access to stairwell * Offering hall * Hall of the Ennead * Great Seat and main sanctuary * Shrine of the Nome of Dendera * Shrine of Isis * Shrine of Sokar * Shrine of Harsomtus * Shrine of Hathor's Sistrum * Shrine of gods of Lower Egypt * Shrine of Hathor * Shrine of the throne of R√™ * Shrine of R√™ * Shrine of Menat collar * Shrine of Ihy * The Pure Place * Court of the First Feast * Passage * Staircase to roof Depictions of Cleopatra VI which appear on temple walls are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art. On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popularly well known Cleopatra) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar (Caesarion), who was fathered by Julius Caesar.Mahaffy, p. 251. =Dendera zodiac= The Denderah zodiac The sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of Taurus (the bull) and the Libra (the balance). A sketch was made of it during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by French colonizers and replaced with a fake. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. The real one is now in the Louvre. Champollion's guess that it was Ptolemaic proved to be correct, and Egyptologists now date it to the first century BC. =Crypts= The subterranean Hathor temple tombs total twelve chambers. Some reliefs are dated to as late as the reign of Ptolemy XII Auletes. The crypts reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the \\"Flame Room\\" floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I offering a statuette of the god Ihy to four images of Hathor. In the crypt, reached from the \\"throne room\\", Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods. =The Dendera light= Dendera light, showing the single representation on the left wall of the right wing in one of the crypts The Hathor Temple has a relief sometimes known as the Dendera light because of a controversial fringe thesis about its nature. The Dendera light images comprise five stone reliefs (two of which contain a pair of what fringe authors refer to as lights) in the Hathor temple at the Dendera Temple complex located in Egypt. The view of Egyptologists is that the relief is a mythological depiction of a djed pillar and a lotus flower, spawning a snake within, representing aspects of Egyptian mythology. In contrast to this interpretation, there is a fringe science suggestion that it is actually a representation of an Ancient Egyptian lightbulb. =Ceiling cleaning= The ceiling of the Hathor Temple was cleaned in a careful way that removed hundreds of years of black soot without harming the ancient paint underneath. Spectacular ceiling painting was exposed in the main hall, and some of the most vibrant and colourful paintings dating from antiquity are now visible. Roman mammisi The Roman mammisi The Roman mammisi is a subsidiary building dating to the reigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Numerous reliefs of Trajan making offerings to Egyptian deities can be seen.

Tourism The Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It used to be possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof. However, the highest part of the roof of Hathor temple has been closed since 2003. The second stage of the roof was closed in November 2004, after a tourist got too close to the edge and fell to her death on the bedrock below.

He was on the board of directors of Bertelsmann from 1990‚Äì2002, being CEO from 1998. From 2004 to March 2009, Middelhoff was chairman of the supervisory board of Arcandor (previously KarstadtQuelle), and CEO of the company. Background Thomas Middelhoff was born in D√ºsseldorf, Germany, the son of a textile businessman. He studied business at the University of M√ºnster and received his doctorate at the Institute for Marketing under the supervision of Heribert Meffert. While at university, he was already working in his father's textile business. After graduating he was given a high post in the company. Bertelsmann (1986 - 2002) In 1986 he moved to Bertelsmann, a multinational media corporation based in Germany, as assistant manager of the graphic firm in G√ºtersloh. In 1990, he became a member of the board of directors of Bertelsmann. Middelhoff recognized the potential of the new digital media early. He made small investments into Firma Pixelpark in Berlin among others, on Bertelsmann's behalf. As an early believer in the rapid development of the Internet, he suggested a large financial participation of Bertelsmann in America Online (AOL) when it was still a young company, and created the joint venture AOL Europe, with a financial holding of $50 million for a 5% stake. This investment was extremely successful and would later influence Middelhoff's ascent in the company to chairman of the board. In May 1995, he became a member of the governing board of AOL, and during his time in this position Middelhoff became a \\"close friend\\" of AOL's founder, Steve Case. In 1995, Bertelsmann and AOL started the joint venture AOL Germany. From November 1998 to July 2002, Middelhoff was the CEO of Bertelsmann. During this time it increased its internet activities by starting the online media portal BOL (Bertelsmann Online), which was sold to in 2002. But Bertelsmann soon stepped back from these online engagements, selling its shares of AOL-Europe back to Time Warner, which had merged with AOL in 2001. In January 2000 Middelhoff declined a directorship at AOL and resigned from the supervisory board of the corporation. Besides his position at the Bertelsmann group, Middelhoff has been a member of the Board of Trustees of the non-profit Bertelsmann Stiftung, too (2000‚Äì2002). Subsequent career and life Beginning in 2003, Middelhoff coordinated the European affairs of the holding company Investcorp. The German businesses of the corporation included and Callahan. After APCOA Parking was taken over by Investcorp in 2004, he was appointed to its supervisory board. Since 2003 Middelhoff has also been a member of the board of The New York Times Company responsible for the compensation committee. As a confidant of Madeleine Schickedanz, he became the chairman of KarstadtQuelle AG's supervisory board in June 2004 and its CEO in May 2005. KarstadtQuelle was renamed Arcandor in 2007. Middelhoff was removed from his position as CEO of Arcandor and Thomas Cook Group in March 2009, following a significant decrease in Arcandor's share prices since he had taken the position in 2005. Three months later, German justice minister Brigitte Zypries announced an investigation into alleged fraud on Middelhoff's part, following allegations of inflated prices for lease agreements involving a firm in which he and his wife were shareholders.Der Spiegel, 6 June 2009, (in German) Immobiliendeals bringen Ex-Arcandor-Chef in Bedr√§ngnis Arcandor declared bankruptcy in the following week. In 2014, Middelhoff was convicted on criminal charges related to his activities while head of Arcandor; he was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Middlehoff served 3 years in prison for Arcandor-related crimes. He separated from his wife, with whom he had five children.

He is named for his great-great-great-granduncle, Quartermaster General Montgomery C. Meigs, the father of Arlington National Cemetery, and for his father Lieutenant Colonel Montgomery Meigs, a World War II tank commander who was killed in action one month before Meigs was born. Early life and education Meigs graduated from the Holderness School in Holderness, New Hampshire in 1965 and went on to United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, where he graduated in 1967. He served as a cavalry troop commander in the Vietnam War with the 9th Infantry Division. After study at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and a year at the Army's Command and General Staff College, he taught in the History Department at West Point and spent the 1981‚Äì82 academic year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an International Affairs Fellow of the Council on Foreign Relations. Military career Meigs visiting a coalition basecamp in Bosnia and Herzegovina Meigs received his PhD in history from Wisconsin in 1982 before reporting to 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment as its executive officer. In 1984, Meigs commanded the 1st Squadron, 1st Armored Cavalry Regiment. Following a stint at the National War College as an Army Fellow, he worked as a strategic planner on the Joint Staff in Washington, D.C. for three years. Returning to Germany, he assumed command of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Armored Division on September 26, 1990 and commanded it through Operation Desert Storm.

Active in radio, stage, television and film, he was best known for his role in the BBC Television drama series Lovejoy.  Early life  Dudley Sutton was born in Kingston upon Thames Dudley Sutton obituary, The Guardian, 16 September 2018. Retrieved 16 September 2018. , and educated at a boys' boarding school at Lifton Park, Devon. He served in the Royal Air Force as a mechanic before enrolling in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, from which he was later expelled for responding to rock-and-roll.  Career  Sutton became known after unusual roles in two films directed by Sidney J. Furie. He played a frustrated teenager accused with his friends of murder in The Boys (1962) and a gay biker in The Leather Boys (1964), both parts showing his potential for offbeat screen personae. At a reunion of the three surviving stars of the earlier film in London on 17 September 2017, Sutton related that he felt himself privileged that these movies had dealt with two matters close to his heart: the iniquity of the death penalty, and gay rights. On stage, he played the title role in the first production of Joe Orton's Entertaining Mr Sloane (1964). From 25 May 1966, he appeared in Tango, a play by Slawomir Mrozek at the Aldwych Theatre alongside Patience Collier, Peter Jeffrey, Mike Pratt, and Ursula Mohan under director Trevor Nunn.\\"Lively Choice of Plays for Aldwych.\\" The Times (London, England) 22 April 1966: p.17.

Among his many television appearances were his roles as Tinker Dill in Lovejoy (1986 and 1991‚Äì94) ‚Äì whose friendship with Lovejoy, the title character, and expertise in the antique trade was the backbone of the show ‚Äì as Mr Carter in the Beiderbecke Trilogy and as Oleg Kirov in Smiley's People (1982). He also featured in The Sweeney episode \\"Golden Boy\\" and in a Christmas special episode of Porridge (1976) as the somewhat-unstable, prison trustee-turned-hostage-taker Reg Urwin, with Ronnie Barker and Richard Beckinsale. In 1999, he appeared in the BBC Radio play Cosmos the Mystic Dog. In 2004, he made an appearance in the soap opera EastEnders for sixteen episodes, playing Wilfred Atkins, a conman. In 2003, Sutton found inspiration from the internet \\"where apparently people say that every time you masturbate God kills a kitten\\". From that statement, he developed a comic piece about \\"a young man's emotions and feelings, from the moment he's a baby tugging at his cock onwards.\\" In August 2003, he performed the one-man Killing Kittens show at Edinburgh's Underbelly. Sutton followed up Killing Kittens with a second autobiographical show Pandora's Lunchbox in 2006. Following a performance as William Blake in Peter Ackroyd's BBC television series The Romantics, Sutton joined the cast of Albion Rising at St Giles in the Fields Church, London, in April 2007. He reprised the role in the film of the same name in 2009. Sutton had a small role in the British teenage drama Skins as Freddie's granddad. He also appeared in the episode of Holby City broadcast on 15 March 2011 as a patient who fell down an escalator in a shopping centre. In 2012, he featured in the video \\"Once And For All\\" by Clock Opera. Sutton also appeared in episode three of the BBC comedy series Family Tree (\\"The Austerity Games\\"), which was first broadcast in July 2013, and was a guest star in episode three of the BBC series Boomers in 2014.

In November 2017 he played the lead role in a video for the Tom Chaplin song \\"Midnight Mass.\\" Personal life He married American actress Marjorie Steele in 1961; she had previously been married to the millionaire producer Huntington Hartford. Sutton and Steele had one child together, but divorced in 1965. He married a further 3 times.  Death  Sutton died of cancer on 15 September 2018 at the age of 85.

The airborne operation was personally ordered by Adolf Hitler, approved by General Kurt Student, and planned and executed by Major Harald Mors.  Overview  On the night between 24 and 25 July 1943, a few weeks after the Allied invasion of Sicily and bombing of Rome, the Grand Council of Fascism voted a motion of no confidence against Mussolini. On the same day, the king replaced him with Marshal Pietro Badoglio and had him arrested. Hitler's common procedure was to give similar orders to competing German military organizations. He ordered the Hauptsturmf√ºhrer Otto Skorzeny to track Mussolini, and simultaneously ordered the paratroop General Kurt Student to execute the liberation. Mussolini was being secluded around Tyrrhenian Sea islands by his captors ‚Äì first to Ponza, then to La Maddalena, where Skorzeny's men were almost attempting an operation. Intercepting a coded Italian radio message, Skorzeny used the reconnaissance provided by the agents and informants (counterfeit notes with a face value of ¬£100,000 forged under Operation Bernhard were used to help obtain information) of SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer Herbert Kappler to determine that Mussolini was being imprisoned in Gran Sasso massif, a remote and defendable mountain plateau, on which was built a hotel linked with a cable car. Hotel Campo Imperatore in 1943 On 12 September 1943, Skorzeny and 16 SS troopers joined the Fallschirmj√§ger to rescue Mussolini in a high-risk glider mission. Ten DFS 230 gliders, each carrying nine soldiers and a pilot, towed by Henschel Hs 126 planes started between 13:05 and 13:10 from the Pratica di Mare Air Base near Rome. The leader of the airborne operation, paratrooper-Oberleutnant Georg Freiherr von Berlepsch, entered the first glider, while Skorzeny and his SS troopers sat in the fourth and fifth glider. To gain height before crossing the close-by Alban Hills, the leading three glider-towing plane units flew an additional loop. All following units considered this manoeuvre unnecessary and preferred not to endanger the given time of arrival at the target. This led to the situation that Skorzeny's two units arrived first over the target. Meanwhile, the valley station of the funicular railway leading to the Campo Imperatore was captured at 14:00 in a ground attack by two paratrooper companies led by Major Harald Mors, who was commander-in-chief of the whole raid. They also cut all telephone lines. At 14:05, the airborne commandos landed their ten DFS 230 gliders on the mountain near the hotel; one crashed, causing injuries. Fieseler Fi 156 used to rescue Mussolini The Fallschirmj√§ger and Skorzeny's special troopers overwhelmed Mussolini's captors‚Äî200 well- equipped Carabinieri guards‚Äîwithout a single shot being fired; this was also due to the fact that General Fernando Soleti of the Italian African Police, who flew in with Skorzeny, told them to stand down. Skorzeny attacked the radio operator and his equipment and stormed into the hotel, followed by his SS troopers and the paratroopers. Ten minutes after the beginning of the raid, Mussolini left the hotel, accompanied by the German soldiers. At 14:45, Major Mors accessed the Hotel via the funicular railway and introduced himself to Mussolini. Subsequently, Mussolini was to be flown out by a Fieseler Fi 156 STOL plane that had arrived in the meanwhile. Although under the given circumstances the small plane was overloaded, Skorzeny insisted on accompanying Mussolini, thus endangering the success of the mission. After an extremely dangerous but successful take-off, they flew to Pratica di Mare. There they continued immediately, flying in a Heinkel He 111 to Vienna, where Mussolini stayed overnight at the Hotel Imperial. The next day he was flown to Munich and on September 14, he met Hitler at F√ºhrer Headquarters Wolf's Lair in near Rastenburg.Erich Kuby: Verrat auf deutsch. Wie das Dritte Reich Italien ruinierte. Hoffmann und Campe, Hamburg 1982, .  Aftermath  Mussolini leaving the Hotel The operation granted a rare late-war public relations opportunity to Hermann G√∂ring, with German propaganda hailing the operation for months afterward. The landing at Campo Imperatore was in fact led by First Lieutenant von Berlepsch, commanded by Major Mors and under orders from General Student, all Fallschirmj√§ger officers; but Skorzeny stewarded the Italian leader right in front of the cameras. After a pro-SS propaganda coup at the behest of Reichsf√ºhrer-SS Heinrich Himmler and propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Skorzeny and his special forces of the Waffen-SS were granted the majority of the credit for the operation. Skorzeny gained a large amount of success from this mission; he received a promotion to Sturmbannf√ºhrer, the award of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross and fame that led to his \\"most dangerous man in Europe\\" image. Winston Churchill himself described the mission as \\"one of great daring\\".

As a wrestler, Munn was a World Heavyweight Champion. His world title win is historic as it was the first time that a pure performer (as opposed to a legitimately skilled wrestler) had won a world championship in professional wrestling. Wrestling career His fame from playing football attracted the attention of wrestling star, Ed Lewis and promoters Toots Mondt and Billy Sandow, who prematurely pushed Munn as the next big star in the sport. Munn won the World title from Lewis in 1925, despite his limited wrestling and shooting (out of ring performing) ability. This backfired on Lewis and his camp, as Munn subsequently lost the title to Stanislaus Zbyszko in a famous double-cross (shoot), as Zbyszko legitimately pinned Munn, despite agreeing to lose to him prior to the match. Munn, unable to defend himself against Zbyszko's holds, was beaten decisively. Munn held the title for a little over three months. Munn went into retirement shortly afterwards, and spent some years in the oil business, before his death from kidney problems at the Fort Sam Houston base hospital in San Antonio, Texas on January 9, 1931. He was survived by his wife and a daughter, Mary Ann Munn. Munn had also served as an infantry first lieutenant during World War I.

Plot summary Unmarried fifty-four-year-old Virginia Miner (Vinnie), a professor at Corinth University who specializes in children's literature, is off to London for another research trip. She loves England and likes to feel that she fits in well there. She is hoping to produce an important new book about playground rhymes. However, she finds that her work has been trashed by a critic, L. D. Zimmern of Columbia, for whom she imagines monstrous dooms. The author makes a point of telling us that Vinnie is not beautiful -- perhaps rather homely -- but that she has had her share of affairs nevertheless, and a brief marriage. Although she enjoys these flings, she has stopped believing that falling or being in love is a good thing. A 'pro' at long flights, her serenity is ruffled by her seatmate, a garrulous married man from Tulsa, Chuck Mumpson. She puts him off by giving him Little Lord Fauntleroy to read. But smoking, drinking, loudly American Chuck is persistent, and ends up contacting her in London. He has been inspired by Little Lord Fauntleroy to want to trace his own family history. Vinnie slowly becomes involved with his project, and then with him. Meanwhile, her young colleague Fred Turner has left his wife, Roo, at home for his own sabbatical in London, where he is researching John Gay. Fred and Roo have quarreled and he fears the marriage is over. He consoles himself with the affections of a beautiful TV actress, Lady Rosemary Radley, who gives him the entree into London high life. The exquisite but not so young Rosemary has never managed to have a really successful love relationship‚Äîthough she is not resigned to this, as Vinnie is. Although Fred is very much in love with her, he cannot give her the commitment she wants, since he must return to Corinth to teach summer school. Rosemary also has a concealed side to her personality that her friends wish to keep hidden from the public, and from journalists including contributors to Private Eye, who lampoon her as \\"Rosalie Raddled\\". When Fred encounters this side of her, the friends close ranks and shut him out. Quite by accident and with the encouragement of Chuck, Vinnie becomes an emissary for Fred's estranged wife in an improbable midnight walk on Hampstead Heath. What makes this favor more challenging for Vinnie is that Roo's father is the nefarious critic L. D. Zimmern. Just as she begins to think Chuck's affections have cooled, because of his silence of several days duration, Vinnie is visited by his daughter who describes his sudden death while climbing the stairs of a small town hall. When an English friend speaks condescendingly of Chuck, Vinnie realizes with surprise that he loved her and she loved him. She returns to her life in Corinth, solitary and unloved, but altered for having loved and been loved.

Courtesy NASA. The Pila Nguru, often referred to in English as the Spinifex people, are an Aboriginal Australian people of Western Australia, whose lands extend to the border with South Australia and to the north of the Nullarbor Plain. The centre of their homeland is in the Great Victoria Desert, at Tjuntjunjarra, some east of Kalgoorlie, perhaps the remotest community in Australia. The Pila Nguru were the last Australian people to have dropped the complete trappings of their traditional lifestyle. They maintain in large part their traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle within the territory, over which their claims to Native title and associated collective rights were recognised by a 28 November 2000 Federal Court decision. In 1997, an art project was started in which indigenous paintings became part of the title claim. In 2005, a major exhibit of their works in London brought the artists widespread attention. Language Spinifex people speak south western dialects of the Wati language division of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages. The name Pila Nguru is an abbreviation of Ana·πâgu tjuta pila nguru (\\"people-land-spinifex-from\\", or people from the land of the spinifex) and reflects an identity rooted in a sense of tenure of territory rather than a strictly linguistic classification. Ecology and lifestyle The contemporary centre is found on the southern edge of the Spinifex homelands. The arid desert which forms the environment where the Pila Nguru live has tree varieties like mulga, western myall and casuarina as well as varieties of cassia, sandalwood and spinifex. Spinifex grasses (porcupine/hummock grasses) dominated communities over 22% of the traditional Australian landmass, and the arid desert areas contain some 35 species. The variety called \\"soft spinifex\\" or, in pidgin English bush araldite is Triodia pungens, prized for its cementing qualities. The general term in Western desert languages for the plant is tjanpi, the plain where it grows is pila, the plant itself, in the Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara languages was tjapura, while the Spinifex resin extracted from it is called kiti. Spinifex grasses were worked to produce cakes of resin that had four basic uses: (a) as a waterproofer, by caulking any wooden object employed for carry around water; (b) as a putty to fill holes or fissures in work materials; (c) as an adhesive to bind materials when making tools, weaponry and ceremonial objects; and (d) as a basic stuff for moulding beads, figurines and other assorted objects. These resin products are commodities also, used as gifts and as important tradewares between tribes. The grasses were cut with stone halfway down the stem. The gathered grass was flailed with a stick to obtain spinifex dust, which then was winnowed and \\"yandied\\", yandi referring to a luandja, a softwood winnowing dish for grass seed: the cleaned seeds were then tipped into another type of dish, called ivirra, worked further with a particular rocking movement and shaking and then heated over stone to yield around 8 cubic metres yielding 600 grams. The resin, thus extracted from varieties of triodia was a key ingredient for binding the stone blades to native hafted adzes, which were of two types, tula and burren, the former, the type used by spinifex people, using the distal edge, the other the lateral edge, for working materials. The materials for the tula adze were obtained by knapping tula flakes to form \\"slugs\\" or blades, the tool being then employed for woodwork, to hollow out yandis or fashion boomerangs and spears. The only artificial dwelling was a wiltja or windbreak. History In evaluating the Pila Nguru claim to native title in 2001, the Federal Court of Australia's Chief Justice Michael Black stated that archaeological evidence indicated a nomadic presence in the Western desert dating back some 20,000 years. There was rapid demographic expansion over most of Australia during the Holocene climatic optimum (9,000-6,000, extending through much of the arid zones. According to Scott Cane the residual debris of artifact use peppering the desert landscape is extremely dense, attesting to a very long period of habitation. =History of contact with whites: 1900‚Äì1952= White incursions into the Pila Nguru homelands started around the 1910s, with the granting of options on pastoral leases, which however failed to be realized. By the 1930s, profiting from the proximity of the Trans-Australian Railway (T.A.R), which had been completed just over a decade earlier, missionaries strove to undertake evangelistic pastoral work in the area, establishing a mission in Warburton but the extremities of trying to live there rendered their activities difficult, and the native lifestyle managed to survive, with the retention of many customary ways. In times of drought during the 1920s down to 1942, itinerant Anangu sought out provisions from the Karonie T.A.R on the Cowarna Downs, where the government had established a rations depot, with food distributed on a monthly basis. It was gradually overtaken by the depot at Cundeelee from 1939, which was closed in 1942. Two other depots distributing rations to those in need existed: one at Zanthus T.A.R, the other halfway between Cundeelee and Queen Victoria Springs. By the 1950s, so little was known about these people that the British chose the Nullarbor for nuclear weapons testing, as they believed it to be devoid of people. Atomic testing, 1953‚Äì1957 When graded roads were built for the Giles Weather Station (part of the Weapons Research Establishment) during 1952‚Äì1955, officials learned that indigenous people - probably then around 150 - lived west of the sites. Scouting just east of this area to find suitable locations for radiation sensors that would measure the fallout, Len Beadell records stumbling on an \\"Aboriginal Stonehenge\\", a geometrical pattern of upturned shale slabs extending for a distance of 60 metres. An officer, the expert bushman Walter MacDougall was sent to warn them of the impending tests. A total of nine small hydrogen bombs ranging up to 25 kilotons were tested at Emu Junction (2 tests, 1953) and Maralinga (7 tests, 1956‚Äì1957). Given that only one officer and an assistant were assigned to warn the Spinifex people who lived across an enormous area far to the west of the test sites, many of the Spinifex were never informed, nor did they leave the area. Officially, all were forced to leave their lands and were not allowed within 200 km of ground zero. Officials made a leaflet drop, but the Spinifex could not read the leaflets and were wary and afraid of the aircraft. In the later stages of the bomb trials, MacDougall discovered that up to 40 Spinifex people may have been hunting over the eastern portion of the prohibited Maralinga area while the tests were being conducted, moving as far east as Vokes Hill and Waldana. One family of twelve were the nearest people, living at Nurrari Lakes less than 200 km west from Maralinga. Although close enough to hear the larger bombs explode, they were healthy several years after the tests. The Australian Royal Commission was unable to determine if Maralinga Tjarutja or Pila Nguru people had been exposed to damaging levels of radiation from fallout, due to the lack of medical records and medical centres. Maralinga bomb plume maps show prevailing northerly winds during tests, whereas the Spinifex lands are 300 km to the west of Maralinga. The closest group was at Nurrari Lakes about 180 km west. Scott Cane's otherwise definitive native title study, Pila Nguru (2000), contained almost no details as to how bomb testing radiation affected the Spinifex people. Native title In 1997 the Spinifex Arts Project was begun to help document the Native Title claims. Both Native Title paintings, the Men's Combined and the Women's Combined, document the entire Spinifex area; they show the claimants' birthplaces and express the important traditional stories that cross and give shape to the area. The Spinifex people were the second tribe in Western Australia to receive recognition of their Native Title land rights in 2000,Spinifex Government of Western Australia, Office of Native Title. Retrieved 2007-04-21. in accordance with Section 87 (agreement) of the Commonwealth Native Title Act 1993. The ruling, by the Federal Court of Australia, in a case brought by a third party on behalf of the Spinifex People, found that agreement had been reached between the applicants and the two named respondents: the State Government of Western Australia and the Shire of Laverton, over a sector of land encompassing around 55,000 km2. This territory - which was designated as either unallocated land or park reserve, and contained no pastoral leases - lies to the north of the lands of the Nullarbor peoples, to the east of the people in the Pilki area and to the south of the Ngaanyatjarra Lands, the eastern boundary being formed by the South Australian border. Apart from the area of two Nature Reserves, the only specific \\"other interests\\" identified within the territory was for public right-of-way along an existing road which traversed some of the territory. The Native Title claim was made by twenty-one families constituting the current Spinifex people. Some People of the Spinifex had begun returning to their land from around 1980. From 2001 many of those who left to live at the Christian missions have since returned to their homelands and the Unnamed Conservation Park Biosphere Reserve (now Mamungari Conservation Park). In 2004 the government turned over the pristine wilderness area of 21,000 sq/km jointly to the Pila Nguru and the Maralinga Tjarutja. Artworks Spinifex art began as what Philip Batty called \\"intercultural debris\\", reflecting their experience of the impact of the outside world. The genre of what the Pila Nguru call \\"government paintings\\" were visual documents created to furnish evidence of their land title, to be produced in court. A theatrical performance, Career Highlights of the Mamu, covering the tribal experience during the period of the atomic tests was performed by Roy Underwood and several other Spinifex people in Hamburg in 2002. In early 2005, the Spinifex people became famous for their solo and group artworks, due to the effect of a major art exhibition of their work in London. Their boldly-coloured \\"dot paintings\\" are not the usual polished commodities produced by many northern tribes for sale to a non- Aboriginal art market, but are authentic works that the Spinifex People have made for their own purposes.

(1973), L-R: Kevin Tighe, Robert Fuller, Julie London, Bobby Troup and Randolph Mantooth Randolph Mantooth (born Randy DeRoy Mantooth, September 19, 1945) is an American actor who has worked in television, documentaries, theater, and film for more than 40 years. A graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, he was discovered in New York by a Universal Studios talent agent while performing the lead in the play Philadelphia, Here I Come. After signing with Universal and moving to California, he slowly built up his resume with work on such dramatic series as Adam-12 (1968), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969), McCloud (1970) and Alias Smith and Jones (1971). He was chosen to play a lead role as paramedic John Gage in the 1970s medical drama, Emergency! (opposite Robert Fuller as Dr. Kelly Brackett, Julie London as Nurse Dixie McCall, Bobby Troup as Dr. Joe Early and Kevin Tighe as Roy DeSoto). The show aired six seasons (129 episodes) and six two- hour television movie specials. Randolph Mantooth has spoken regularly at Firefighter and EMS conferences and symposia across the United States while maintaining an active acting career. He is a spokesperson for both the International Association of Firefighters [IAFF] and the International Association of Fire Chiefs [IAFC] for firefighter health and safety, and honored over the years with numerous awards and recognition. Mantooth has appeared in numerous films and television series in lead and supportive roles including miniseries adaptations of Testimony of Two Men (1977) and a starring role as Abraham Kent in The Seekers (1979). Through the 1990s and 2000s, he appeared in daytime soap operas, earning him four Soap Opera Digest Award nominations. He frequently returns to performing in theatrical productions. He serves as an associate artist at Jeff Daniels' Purple Rose Theatre. His performances includes Mark Kaufman's Evil Little Thoughts, Black Elk Speaks, Carey Crim's Morning after Grace, Lanford Wilson's Rain Dance, and innumerable works by Native American playwrights including William S. Yellow Robe, Jr. History Mantooth, the oldest of four children, was born as Randy DeRoy Mantooth in Sacramento, California in 1945, to Sadie (n√©e Neddenreip) and Donald \\"Buck\\" Mantooth. He is of Seminole, Cherokee, Potawatomi, Scottish, and German descent. His siblings are Don, Nancy and Tonya. Mantooth attended San Marcos High School and participated in school plays. Following his studies at Santa Barbara City College, he received a scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. It was there that he chose to change his first name from \\"Randy\\" to stage name \\"Randolph\\", keeping his last name. His performance as \\"Gar\\" in the play Philadelphia Here I Come earned him the Charles Jehlenger Award for Best Actor, an honor he shared with fellow actor Brad Davis. Mantooth's earlier jobs included work as an elevator operator at the Madison Avenue Baptist Church and as a page at NBC Studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City. His very first paying job in life was as a newspaper boy for the local paper, the Coatesville Record, in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. On April 2, 2013, Mantooth's mother, Sadie Mantooth, died at age 90 at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara, California. The Los Angeles County Fire Museum received a special donation from him to dedicate the memory of his mother. In 2015, he revealed that he was diagnosed with cancer earlier that year and had completed treatment, heading towards a recovery. Career =Early work (1970s)= Mantooth was discovered in New York City by Universal Studios' talent agent Eleanor Kilgallen (sister of Dorothy Kilgallen) while playing the lead in the play Philadelphia Here I Come. After signing with Universal and moving back to California, he slowly built up his resume with work on such dramatic series as Adam-12 (1968), Marcus Welby, M.D. (1969), McCloud (1970) and Alias Smith and Jones (1971). This led to television stardom on the popular Emergency! series in 1972 which aired on NBC for six seasons. He earned further roles in two series. Mantooth portrayed Lt. Mike Bender on Operation Petticoat (1977) and as Eddie Dawkins on Detective School (1979). He was featured as a guest performer on episodic television. He appeared on several programs including Sierra, Cos, The Love Boat, Battlestar Galactica and Vega$. =Emergency! (1972‚Äì1979)= Producer Robert A. Cinader saw Randolph Mantooth in a small role on The Bold Ones opposite Hal Holbrook that led to his decision to cast him as paramedic John Gage on Emergency! Randolph Mantooth and Kevin Tighe were part of a paramedic team assigned to Squad 51 of the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Responding to accidents or dangerous rescues in an \\"emergency room on wheels\\" with directions via biophone from medical personnel back at the hospital, the paramedics performed Advanced Life Support (ALS) techniques to stabilize injured, ill, and dying patients before transporting them to a medical facility. To train for their parts, the actors, Randolph Mantooth along with Kevin Tighe, \\"...sat in on paramedic classes\\" (although they never took any written exams) \\"and rode out on extensive ride- a-longs with LACoFD\\". In an interview with Tom Blixa of WTVN, Mantooth said that the producer wanted them to train so that they would at least know the fundamentals and look like they knew what they were doing on camera. Mantooth mentioned that unless you take the written course you are not a paramedic and that \\"if anyone has a heart attack, I'll call 911 with the best of them\\". According to authors Richard Yokley and Roxane Sutherland who wrote the book, Emergency! Behind the Scenes, the show Emergency! is an important chapter in television history. At the time of the series' world premiere in 1972, there were only 12 paramedical units in North America located in four municipalities. Ten years later, more than half of all Americans were within ten minutes of a paramedic rescue or ambulance unit, due to the influence of the show. The program introduced audiences from all over the world to the concept of pre-hospital care, along with fire prevention and CPR. The show ran six seasons (129 episodes) with seven two-hour television movie specials including the pilot film (The Wedsworth-Townsend Act). with a national audience that averaged 30 million viewers each week. Mantooth directed two episodes of Emergency!; \\"The Nuisance\\" (1976) and \\"Insanity Epidemic\\" (1977), and also directed the television movie Greatest Rescues of Emergency (1978). Mantooth and Tighe did many of their own stunts in the early years with the rule of thumb, \\"if you could see our faces, it was us doing the stunts; if you couldn't, it was our stunt doubles.\\" He was offered an opportunity after Emergency! went off the air to be an actual firefighter, but decided to continue with acting. Nearly 30 years after Emergency! debuted, the Smithsonian Institution accepted Emergency! memorabilia into its American History Museum in the public service division and not entertainment on May 16, 2000. Items inducted at the Smithsonian included their uniforms, scripts, helmets, turnouts, biophone, and defibrillator. In conjunction to the induction of the equipment from Emergency! at the Smithsonian, Project 51 was created in an effort to raise funds for a children's burn charity, and exhibit the restored squad around the country. Mantooth, along with Marco Lopez, Tim Donnelly, Ron Pinkard and Mike Stoker embarked on a 10-city tour with the squad to raise funds for charity on their way to Washington, D.C. with their final destination being the Smithsonian. Project 51 folded after the equipment was inducted into the Smithsonian and the funds were distributed to burn centers, fire education projects, and museums. In 2012, Mantooth and Tighe were presented with the traditional white leather cairns helmets by the Los Angeles County Fire Department as Honorary Fire Chiefs of the department. The honor was bestowed on the men for their contributions to the fire service and emergency medicine through educating and inspiring kids and adults to be firefighters, EMTs, or paramedics. The series contributed to the revolution in emergency medicine and mobile health across the country. The series was placed into syndication in 1977 as Emergency! One to some local stations in the late 1970s. It was called Emergency! One because the show was still filming new episodes in the United States. After the show ended, the name reverted to Emergency! The show was sold overseas and aired in a number of countries, including Germany where it was renamed Notruf California, in addition to being dubbed in Spanish in the United States. In the late 1990s and 2000s, Emergency! began airing on cable and digital sub-channels networks that included TV Land, RTV, MeTV, and Cozi TV. Emergency! spun off an animated version called Emergency +4 aired on NBC Saturday mornings from 1973 to 1976, with Mantooth and Kevin Tighe voicing the animated characters of John Gage and Roy DeSoto. Starship Rescue aired in 1973 to promote NBC's fall lineup of Saturday morning programs focusing on Emergency! and Star Trek: The Animated Series and it was hosted by Mantooth and Tighe. Tighe and Mantooth also presented the work of firefighters and paramedics from the Los Angeles County Fire Department on the NBC Saturday morning children's series Go!. Mantooth's and Tighe's likeness were used for games, puzzles, lunch boxes, action figures, and comic books connected to the series. The comic books for Emergency focused on the primary actors from Rampart Hospital, along with Johnny and Roy. The four comic books, and four magazines, were issued by Charlton Comics in 1976. Some of the issues were drawn by John Byrne and Neal Adams. Emergency! +4 and Emergency! both had coloring books that were created to promote the series to young viewers using the likenesses of the five principal characters. Viewmaster released a series of reels that had film stills of the show arranged in a story or photo montage. Mantooth and Kevin Tighe's characters John Gage and Roy DeSoto appeared on another Robert A. Cinader created series, Sierra. The series focused on National Park Service Rangers stationed in the Sierras. Mantooth and Tighe appeared in the episode, \\"Urban Rangers\\". Mantooth's character appeared on a crossover episode of Adam-12 called \\"Lost and Found\\". The on-screen camaraderie between Mantooth and Tighe, as well as their friendship with both London and Troup, carried over to real life as well. Before London's and Troup's deaths, all four remained close friends after the series came to a close, and Tighe served as best man at Mantooth's second wedding in 2002. While talking with Tom Blixa of WTVN, Mantooth said that at first it was a little intimidating working with Robert Fuller, Bobby Troup and Julie London, because they were all big stars but after doing a series with them for seven years they all became like family. In the same interview while discussing happenings behind the scenes and blooper reels, Mantooth said there was \\"a lot of salty language though\\"...\\"and we learned every bad word from Julie London\\"...‚ÄùI love her to death but she herself said 'I'm a broad'\\". In a 2013 interview with the Tolucan Times, Mantooth said of his decades-long colleague, \\"Julie London was a mentor to all of us. She let the words work for her, rather than emoting; that‚Äôs all anybody needed.\\" Firefighter/EMS advocate and spokesperson In addition to Mantooth working as an actor for over forty years, he has remained an advocate of firefighters, paramedics, EMTs, and other emergency medical services providers. He does speeches and personal appearances each year at events across the country, discussing the \\"inside story of the development of the television series Emergency! and its impact on the EMS system development\\". Having worked closely with the nation's first certified firefighter/paramedics, who served as technical advisors on the set of Emergency!. Mantooth brings a perspective and insight into the startup and history of pre-hospital treatment in the field. He worked alongside influential men who made a difference ... men he greatly admired ... the late Robert A. Cinader, creator and executive producer of Emergency!, and the man known as the Father of Modern Emergency Medical Services, close friend and mentor, the late James O. Page. According to A.J. Heightman, Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Emergency Medical Services (JEMS), \\"Randy Mantooth is one of the strongest reminders of how America turned the dedicated delivery of basic emergency care into a systematic approach to EMS and Advanced Life Support\\". Mantooth's dedication to promoting and advocating for the fire service and EMS is shown through personal reasons, \\"I owe an incredible debt to firefighters, EMTs, and paramedics... so that's a debt that no one can really payback, but you can try. That's why it's so important for me to do what I do.\\" Mantooth references his own life being saved from carbon monoxide poisoning at home during the run of Emergency!, in addition to paramedics and a flight nurse saving his sister's life after she was involved in a car accident. Mantooth also advocates for the health and safety of firefighters and education them on the dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning and secondary effects of low level CO poisoning. In association with Masimo Corporation, he speaks on carbon monoxide poisoning nationwide. Masimo Corporation funded a video, narrated by Mantooth, regarding the dangers of carbon monoxide to educate firefighters. He serves as a spokesperson for the International Association of Firefighters (IAFF) on Health and Safety. He has been honored over the years with numerous awards and recognition, most recently the James O. Page Award of Excellence from the International Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), EMS section. He is a lifetime member of the National Association of Emergency Medical Technicians (NAEMT) and a lifetime member of the Washington D.C.-based Advocates for EMS. He \\"accepts the accolades with gracious deference to those he considers our true heroes\\". Mantooth serves as honorary chairman and spokesperson for the non-profit County of Los Angeles Fire Museum Association. Mantooth's work as an advocate for firefighters and EMT also extended to the Native peoples. In May 2012, he filmed an Emergency Preparedness video to be distributed to tribal leaders with Monte Fronk in Minnesota at the Mille Lacs Ojibwe Reservation. The project was funded through a public health education grant through the University of Minnesota. Mantooth served as a moderator recently in a project done in conjunction with the Los Angeles County Fire Museum, Pioneers of Paramedicine, and is an effort to document and record the history of the paramedicine program. Originally filmed in 2001, with additional scenes filmed in 2013, this features discussions with four doctors: Eugene Nagel, M.D. from Miami; Leonard Cobb, M.D., Seattle; J. Michael Criley, M.D., Los Angeles; and Walter Graf, M.D., in Los Angeles. These doctors pioneered the idea of mobile medicine and paramedics based on early ideas in Northern Ireland and Russia. =1980s to present= Mantooth appeared in the miniseries adaptations of Taylor Caldwell's 1968 novel Testimony of Two Men (1977) and John Jakes' novel The Seekers (1979‚Äì80).

It is the fourth and final novel in a tetralogy, succeeding Rabbit, Run; Rabbit Redux; and Rabbit Is Rich. A related novella, Rabbit Remembered, was published in 2001. Rabbit at Rest won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1991, the second \\"Rabbit\\" novel to garner that award. Plot summary This novel is part of the series that follows the life of Harry \\"Rabbit\\" Angstrom from 1960 to 1990. Rabbit at Rest focuses on the years 1988‚Äì89. Harry, nearly 40 years after his glory days as a high school basketball star in a mid-sized Pennsylvania city, has retired with Janice, his wife of 33 years, to sunny Florida during the cold months, where Harry is depressed, dangerously overweight and desperate for reasons to keep on living. Unable to stop nibbling corn chips, macadamia nuts and other junk food, Rabbit nearly dies after a heart attack while sunfishing with his nine- year-old granddaughter, Judy. In a \\"redemption\\" of the drowning death of his infant daughter Rebecca in the earlier novel Rabbit, Run, he saves Judy from drowning during their sunfishing afternoon. He is distracted from his own existential worries by the acts of his drug-addicted son, Nelson, to whom Janice (the actual owner of the Angstroms' wealth) has given control of the family's thriving business, a Pennsylvania Toyota dealership. The discovery that Nelson has been stealing from the company to support his drug habit causes Harry to lose the family business. Despite his multiplying difficulties, Rabbit manages to take solace in the presence of Judy, who has matured into a beautiful and charming young lady, reminding him of his high- school glory days. He is less attached to his four-year-old grandson Roy, who seems wary and fearful of Rabbit, much like Nelson. While recuperating from heart surgery, Rabbit recognizes a nurse, Annabelle Byer, as his illegitimate daughter by his old girlfriend, Ruth. He spends time with her without identifying himself as her likely father. Then, his long-term mistress, Thelma Harrison (wife of his high-school nemesis Ron), dies of lupus. Ron confronts Harry at Thelma's funeral, but the men later reconcile over golf. Harry also encounters Cindy Murkett at the funeral, a woman he had once been obsessed with, and is saddened to see she has become an obese and bitter divorcee. After Nelson comes back from a treatment program, and Janice begins work as a real estate agent, the family finds out that Harry has had a one-night stand with Pru, Nelson's wife, on the night after he was released from the hospital. Janice's anger over this betrayal prompts Harry to escape to Florida. While in hiding, Harry has a heart attack shortly after winning a one-on-one basketball game with a local youth (echoing the opening of Rabbit, Run in which Harry impulsively joins a group of teenagers playing basketball). Nelson and Janice reach Harry's bedside while he is still alive. Janice forgives him for his infidelities and he reconciles with his son. His personal business now largely resolved, Rabbit dies. Themes The novel deals with the passage of time, and generational change. Harry's decline mirrors the decline of the United States which, in the period the novel is set, lacks what Harry saw as its animating purpose: the Cold War.

Harry and Janice, his wife of 22 years, live comfortably, having inherited her late father's Toyota dealership. He is indeed rich, but Harry's persistent problems--his wife's drinking, his troubled son's schemes, his libido, and spectres from his past--complicate life. Having achieved an opulent lifestyle that would have embarrassed his working-class parents, Harry is not greedy, but neither is he ever quite satisfied. Harry has grown smitten with a country-club friend's young wife. He worries about Nelson, his indecisive son, a student at Kent State University.

It was more of a series of maneuvers and skirmishes than an actual battle and casualties were negligible. Background In the initial stages of the campaign, Union Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans's Army of the Cumberland induced the Confederate Army of Tennessee under Gen. Braxton Bragg to evacuate the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee. Rosecrans dispatched three corps on three different roads toward northwestern Georgia. The corps on the center road was the XIV Corps under Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas, which moved just across the border to Trenton, Georgia, and prepared to move on to Lafayette in pursuit of Bragg. Lafayette was the present location of Bragg's army. Due to misinformation and poor intelligence, Rosecrans was convinced that Bragg was demoralized and was retreating to Dalton, Georgia, farther to the southeast. But once he realized that the Union forces had separated and were vulnerable, Bragg intended to attack Thomas, halt his advance, and defeat him. Battle thumb310pxSituation, September 11, 1863. Map of Davis' Cross Roads Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Thomas's corps raced forward, seized the important gaps in Missionary Ridge and Pigeon Mountain, and moved out into McLemore Cove. Maj. Gen. James S. Negley's division, supported by Brig. Gen. Absalom Baird's division, was moving across the mouth of the cove on the Dug Gap road when Negley learned that Confederate units were concentrating around Dug Gap. Moving through determined resistance, he closed on the gap, withdrawing to Davis' Cross Roads in the evening of September 10 to await the supporting division. Bragg had ordered Maj. Gen. Thomas C. Hindman with his division to assault Negley in the flank at Davis's Cross Roads, while Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne's division forced its way through Dug Gap to strike Negley in front. Hindman was to receive reinforcements for this movement, but most of them did not arrive. The Confederate officers, therefore, met and decided that they could not attack in their present condition. The next morning, however, fresh troops did arrive, and the Confederates began to move on the Union line. The supporting Union division had by now joined Negley, and, hearing of a Confederate attack, the Union forces determined that a strategic withdrawal to Stevens Gap was in order. Negley first moved his division to the ridge east of West Chickamauga Creek, where it established a defensive line. The other division then moved through them to Stevens Gap and established a defensive line there. Both divisions awaited the rest of Thomas's corps. All of this was accomplished under constant pursuit and fire from the Confederates. Aftermath After his abortive attempt to attack one isolated Union corps, Bragg turned his attention to the corps to his north, the XXI Corps under Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden, setting the stage for the bloody Battle of Chickamauga on September 19.

Spessartine's name is a derivative of Spessart in Bavaria, Germany, the type locality of the mineral. It occurs most often in granite pegmatite and allied rock types and in certain low-grade metamorphic phyllites. Sources include Australia, Myanmar, India, Afghanistan, Israel, Madagascar, Namibia, Nigeria, Mozambique, Tanzania and the United States. Spessartine of an orange-yellow has been called Mandarin garnet and is found in Madagascar. Violet-red spessartines are found in rhyolites in Colorado and Maine. In Madagascar, spessartines are exploited either in their bedrock or in alluvium. The orange garnets result from sodium-rich pegmatites. Spessartines are found in bedrock in the highlands in the Sahatany valley. Those in alluvium are generally found in southern Madagascar or in the Maevatanana region. Spessartine forms a solid solution series with the garnet species almandine. Well-formed crystals from this series, varying in color from very dark-red to bright yellow-orange, were found in Latinka, Rhodope Mountains, Kardzhali Province, Bulgaria. Spessartine, like the other garnets, always occurs as a blend with other species. Gems with high spessartine content tend toward a light orange hue, while almandine prevalence induces red or brownish hues.Spessartite Garnet Gemological Information Images File:Garnet - Spessartine crystal detail.jpgSpessartine crystal from Pakistan File:Garnet, quartz, feldspar 5.jpgSpessartine on smoky quartz: Wushan Spessartine Mine, Tongbei, Fujian Province, China File:Spessartine-t08-49a.jpgReddish-orange spessartine File:Spessartine-spess-23b.jpgTwo \\"frog-eyes\\" of 1.8 cm each sit perched atop a matrix See also * Andradite * Gemstone * Grossular * Mineral collecting * Pyrope * Tsavorite * Uvarovite References External links Category:Manganese(II) minerals Category:Aluminium minerals Category:Garnet group Category:Cubic minerals ","title":"Spessartine"},{"id":"1895412","text":"Grossular is a calcium-aluminium species of the garnet group of minerals. It has the chemical formula of Ca3Al2(SiO4)3 but the calcium may, in part, be replaced by ferrous iron and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular is derived from the botanical name for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia. Other shades include cinnamon brown (cinnamon stone variety), red, and yellow. Grossular is a gemstone. In geological literature, grossular has often been called grossularite. Since 1971, however, use of the term grossularite for the mineral has been discouraged by the International Mineralogical Association. Hessonite Striated crystals of hessonite, a variety of the grossular species Hessonite or \\"cinnamon stone\\" is a common variety of grossular with the general formula: Ca3Al2Si3O12. The name comes from the (hƒìss≈çn), meaning inferior; an allusion to its lower hardness and lower density than most other garnet species varieties. It has a characteristic red color, inclining to orange or yellow, much like that of zircon. It was shown many years ago, by Sir Arthur Herbert Church, that many gemstones, especially engraved gems (commonly regarded as zircon), were actually hessonite. The difference is readily detected by the specific gravity, that of hessonite being 3.64 to 3.69, while that of zircon is about 4.6. Hessonite has a similar hardness to that of quartz (being about 7 on the mohs scale), while the hardness of most garnet species is nearer 7.5. Hessonite comes chiefly from Sri Lanka and India, where it is found generally in placer deposits, though its occurrence in its native matrix is not unknown. It is also found in Brazil and California. Deposits Grossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite. A highly sought after variety of gem garnet is the fine green Grossular garnet from Kenya and Tanzania called tsavorite. This garnet was discovered in the 1960s in the Tsavo area of Kenya, from which the gem takes its name. Viluite is a variety name of grossular, that is not a recognized mineral species.Viluite Mindat database It is usually olive green though sometimes brownish or reddish, brought about by impurities in the crystal. Viluite is found associated with and is similar in appearance to vesuvianite, and there is confusion in terminology as viluite has long been used as a synonym for wiluite, a sorosilicate of the vesuvianite group. This confusion in nomenclature dates back to James Dwight Dana.The System of Mineralogy of James Dwight Dana.

Landmarks of Healing: a Study of House Made of Dawn. Albuquerque: University of New Mexico, 1990. Print.  Background  With 198 pages, House Made of Dawn was conceived first as a series of poems, then replanned as stories, and finally shaped into a novel. It is based largely on Momaday's firsthand knowledge of life at Jemez Pueblo. Like the novel's protagonist, Abel, Momaday lived both inside and outside of mainstream society, growing up on reservations and later attending school and teaching at major universities. In the novel Momaday combines his personal experiences with his imagination ‚Äì something his father, Al Momaday, and his mother taught him to do, according to his memoir The Names. Details in the novel correspond to real-life occurrences. Momaday refers in his memoir The Names to an incident that took place at Jemez on which he based the murder in House Made of Dawn. A native resident killed a New Mexico state trooper, and the incident created great controversy. Native American beliefs and customs, actual geographical locations, and realistic events also inspired elements in House Made of Dawn. According to one of Momaday's letters: > Abel is a composite of the boys I knew at Jemez. I wanted to say something > about them. An appalling number of them are dead; they died young, and they > died violent deaths. One of them was drunk and run over. Another was drunk > and froze to death. (He was the best runner I ever knew.) One man was > murdered, butchered by a kinsman under a telegraph pole just east of San > Isidro. And yet another committed suicide. A good many who have survived > this long are living under the Relocation Program in Los Angeles, Chicago, > Detroit, etc. They're a sad lot of people. According to one historian, the novel is highly accurate in its portrayal of a peyote service, though in southern California such services normally take place in the desert, not the city.Stewart, p. 319. In 1972, an independent feature film based on House Made of Dawn by Richardson Morse was released. Momaday and Morse wrote the script. Larry Littlebird starred. Considered a \\"classic\\", NMAI went to great efforts to preserve the film, now housing all film elements in its film and media archives, which provide study copies.  Plot summary  = Part I: The Longhair = House Made of Dawn begins with the protagonist, Abel, returning to his reservation in New Mexico after fighting in World War II. The war has left him emotionally devastated and he arrives too drunk to recognize his grandfather, Francisco. Now an old man with a lame leg, Francisco had earlier been a respected hunter and participant in the village's religious ceremonies. He raised Abel after the death of Abel's mother and older brother, Vidal. Francisco instilled in Abel a sense of native traditions and values, but the war and other events severed Abel's connections to that world of spiritual and physical wholeness and connectedness to the land and its people, a world known as a \\"house made of dawn.\\" After arriving in the village, Abel attains a job through Father Olguin chopping wood for Angela St. John, a rich white woman who is visiting the area to bathe in the mineral waters. Angela seduces Abel to distract herself from her own unhappiness, but also because she senses an animal-like quality in Abel. She promises to help him leave the reservation to find better means of employment. Possibly as a result of this affair, Abel realizes that his return to the reservation has been unsuccessful. He no longer feels at home and he is confused. His turmoil becomes clearer when he is beaten in a game of horsemanship by a local albino Indian named Juan Reyes, described as \\"the white man.\\" Deciding Juan is a witch, Abel stabs him to death outside of a bar. Abel is then found guilty of murder and sent to jail. = Part II: The Priest of the Sun = Part II takes place in Los Angeles, California six and a half years later. Abel has been released from prison and unites with a local group of Indians. The leader of the group, Reverend John Big Bluff Tosamah, Priest of the Sun, teases Abel as a \\"longhair\\" who is unable to assimilate to the demands of the modern world. However, Abel befriends a man named Ben Benally from a reservation in New Mexico and develops an intimate relationship with Milly, a kind, blonde social worker. However, his overall situation has not improved and Abel ends up drunk on the beach with his hands, head, and upper body beaten and broken. Memories run through his mind of the reservation, the war, jail, and Milly. Abel eventually finds the strength to pick himself up and he stumbles across town to the apartment he shares with Ben. = Part III: The Night Chanter = Ben puts Abel on a train back to the reservation and narrates what has happened to Abel in Los Angeles. Life had not been easy for Abel in the city. First, he was ridiculed by Reverend Tosamah during a poker game with the Indian group. Abel is too drunk to fight back. He remains drunk for the next two days and misses work. When he returns to his job, the boss harasses him and Abel quits. A downward spiral begins and Abel continues to get drunk every day, borrow money from Ben and Milly, and laze around the apartment. Fed up with Abel's behavior, Ben throws him out of the apartment. Abel then seeks revenge on Martinez, a corrupt policeman who robbed Ben one night and hit Abel across the knuckles with his big stick. Abel finds Martinez and is almost beaten to death. While Abel is in the hospital recovering, Ben calls Angela who visits him and revives his spirit, just as he helped revive her spirit years ago, by reciting a story about a bear and a maiden which incidentally matches an old Navajo myth. = Part IV: The Dawn Runner = Abel returns to the reservation in New Mexico to take care of his grandfather, who is dying. His grandfather tells him the stories from his youth and stresses the importance of staying connected to his people's traditions. When the time comes, Abel dresses his grandfather for burial and smears his own body with ashes. As the dawn breaks, Abel begins to run. He is participating in a ritual his grandfather told him about‚Äîthe race of the dead. As he runs, Abel begins to sing for himself and Francisco. He is coming back to his people and his place in the world.  Literary significance and criticism  House Made of Dawn produced no extensive commentary when it was first published‚Äîperhaps, as William James Smith mused in a review of the work in Commonwealth LXXXVIII (20 September 1968), because \\"it seems slightly un- American to criticize an American Indian's novel\\"‚Äîand its subject matter and theme did not seem to conform to the prescription above. Early reviewers such as Marshall Sprague in his \\"Anglos and Indians\\", New York Times Book Review (9 June 1968) complained that the novel contained \\"plenty of haze\\" but suggested that perhaps this was inevitable in rendering \\"the mysteries of cultures different from our own\\" and then goes on to describe this as \\"one reason why [the story] rings so true.\\" Sprague also discussed the seeming contradiction of writing about a native oral culture‚Äîespecially in English, the language of the so-called oppressor. He continues, \\"The mysteries of cultures different from our own cannot be explained in a short novel, even by an artist as talented as Mr. Momaday\\".(Sprague in Samudio, p. 940) The many critics‚Äîsuch as Carole Oleson in her \\"The Remembered Earth: Momaday's House Made of Dawn\\", South Dakota Review II (Spring 1973)‚Äîwho have given the novel extended analysis acknowledge that much more explanation is needed \\"before outsiders can fully appreciate all the subtleties of House Made of Dawn.\\" Baine Kerr has elaborated this point to suggest that Momaday has used \\"the modern Anglo novel [as] a vehicle for a sacred text,\\" that in it he is \\"attempting to transliterate Indian culture, myth, and sensibility into an alien art form, without loss.\\" However, some commentators have been more critical. In reviewing the \\"disappointing\\" novel for Commonweal (September 20, 1968), William James Smith chastised Momaday for his mannered style: \\"[He] writes in a lyric vein that borrows heavily from some of the slacker rhythms of the King James Bible ... It makes you itch for a blue pencil to knock out all the intensified words that maintain the soporific flow\\" [link added]. Other critics said it was nothing but \\"an interesting variation of the old alienation theme\\"; \\"a social statement rather than ... a substantial artistic achievement\\"; \\"a memorable failure,\\" \\"a reflection, not a novel in the comprehensive sense of the word\\" with \\"awkward dialogue and affected description\\"; \\"a batch of dazzling fragments\\". Overall, the book has come to be seen as a success. Sprague concluded in his article that the novel was superb. And Momaday was widely praised for the novel's rich description of Indian life. Now there is a greater recognition of Momaday's fictional art, and critics have come to recognise its unique achievement as a novel. Despite a qualified reception the novel had succeeded in making its impact even on earlier critics though they were not sure of their own responses. They found it \\"a story of considerable power and beauty,\\" \\"strong in imaginative imagery,\\" creating a \\"world of wonder and exhilarating vastness.\\" In more recent criticism there are signs of greater clarity of understanding of Momaday's achievement. In his review (which appeared in Western American Literature 5 (Spring 1970)), John Z. Bennett had pointed out how through \\"a remarkable synthesis of poetic mode and profound emotional and intellectual insight into the Indians' perduring human status[\\"] Momaday's novel becomes at last the very act it is dramatizing, an artistic act, a \\"creation hymn.\\"  Awards  * Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, 1969  Influence  Critic Kenneth Lincoln identified the Pulitzer for House Made of Dawn as the moment that sparked the Native American Renaissance. Many major American Indian novelists (e.g. Paula Gunn Allen, Leslie Marmon Silko, Gerald Vizenor, James Welch, Sherman Alexie and Louise Erdrich) have cited the novel as a significant inspiration for their own work.

Vaginal lubrication can be removed by using herbal aphrodisiacs, household detergents, antiseptics, by wiping out the vagina, or by placing leaves in the vagina besides other methods.International Family Planning Perspectives, Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998, Vaginal Drying Agents and HIV Transmission by Karen E.

Removing or preventing vaginal lubrication through practices associated with dry sex increases friction during intercourse, which may be perceived as increased vaginal tightness, and enhanced sexual pleasure for the male partner.

Dry sex is common in Sub-Saharan Africa and it has also been reported in Suriname among Afro-Surinamese women. Health risks The practice has been linked to the high incidence of HIV/AIDS infection in South Africa. The practice is regarded as increasing the risk of transmitting sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) for both partners, including HIV in a number of ways. Increased friction during intercourse can cause lacerations in vaginal tissue. Drying the vagina also removes the natural antiseptic lactobacilli which combat sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, dry sex increases the risk that a condom will break because of the increased friction. It may also result in vaginal inflammation and/or traumatic lesions which in turn may increase the transmission of STDs in other ways.

First licensed on March 18, 1922, it was one of the United States' first broadcasting stations.As of March 10, 1922, 8 days before WBT was licensed, the Department of Commerce reported that there were 67 authorized broadcasting stations, including, in the South, WGH in Montgomery, Alabama. (\\"List of stations broadcasting market or weather reports (485 meters) and music, concerts, lectures, etc. (360 meters), (March 10, 1922)\\" Radio Service Bulletin, March 1, 1922, pages 13-14.) The station airs a news/talk radio format that is simulcast on WBT-FM 99.3 and the HD2 digital sub-channel of co-owned 107.9 WLNK. WBT is owned by Entercom, one of the largest radio stations operators in America. Studios and offices are at One Julian Price Place on West Morehead Street, just west of Uptown Charlotte, co- located with the city's CBS television affiliate, WBTV, which is currently owned by Gray Television but at one time had common ownership with WBT Radio.\\"Contact Us\\" (wbt.radio.com) WBT broadcasts full-time with 50,000-watts at 1110 kHz, as a Class A clear-channel station. Its transmitter is located in the southern part of the city off Nations Ford Road.\\"Predicted Daytime Coverage Area for WBT 1110 AM, Charlotte, NC\\" (radio-locator.com) During daylight hours it uses a non-directional antenna and is audible in a significant portion of the Carolinas, including cities as far away as Greensboro and Winston-Salem, North Carolina and Spartanburg and Columbia, South Carolina. At night it uses a directional antenna that limits its signal toward the west, in order to avoid interfering with KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, the other Class A station on the frequency. Even with this restriction, its nighttime signal reaches most of the eastern half of North America. For many years, WBT boasted that it could be heard \\"from Maine to Miami\\" at night. Programming On weekdays, WBT airs mostly locally produced talk shows and offer podcasts of these shows on its official website. News, weather, and traffic reports are heard each half-hour. WBT begins each weekday with a four- hour morning drive time newscast hosted by Bo Thompson called \\"WBT's Morning News\\". Thompson and former North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory host a one-hour talk show immediately following the morning news. Vince Coakley, former WSOC- TV news anchor and North Carolina Congressional candidate, hosts from 10 am to noon. Brett Winterble hosts the late afternoon show and a one-hour newsmagazine called \\"Charlotte at Six\\" is anchored by Mark Garrison. The rest of the weekday schedule is made up of nationally syndicated hosts including Rush Limbaugh, Dave Ramsey, Mark Levin and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, technology, cars and home repair, some of which are paid brokered programming.\\"Daily Schedule\\" (wbt.com) Syndicated shows include \\"The Tech Guy with Leo Laporte\\" and \\"Cigar Dave\\". Some hours begin with ABC Radio News. =Sports= Since 2005, WBT has been the flagship station of the Carolina Panthers football team. It also was the Panthers' radio flagship from the team's 1995 inception until 1999. WBT was the flagship of the Charlotte Hornets from the team's debut in 1988 until the team moved to New Orleans in 2002. From 1991 to 1995, WBT was the Charlotte-area home of the Duke Blue Devils. It was also the Charlotte home of the University of North Carolina Tar Heels from 1977 to 1991 and again from 1995 to 2006. The Tar Heels returned to WBT in 2012. History =Formation= As with many early radio stations, there is a limited amount of information about WBT's origins. Wesley Wallace's 1962 review of the history of North Carolina radio reported being frustrated \\"by the absence or inaccessibility\\" of information, noting that \\"Broadcasters have been too busy acting in the present tense to take much thought of the past; hence they have discarded much of the memorabilia of broadcasting's earlier days.\\"The Development of Broadcasting in North Carolina, 1922-1948 (PhD dissertation) by Wesley Herndon Wallace, Department of History, Duke University, 1962, page ii. WBT was first licensed as a broadcasting station on March 18, 1922. However, the station traces its history to earlier broadcasts made in a joint effort by Fred Laxton, associated with General Electric, Earle J. Gluck,Gluck was later a partner in competitor WSOC, and was the first president of WSOC-TV when it launched in 1957. a Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company engineer and Frank Bunker, a Southern Bell Telephone Company employee. During World War I a ban was in place that suspended amateur radio transmissions. In late 1919 the ban was lifted, and all three became licensed radio amateurs. Most amateurs at this time used spark transmitters that could only transmit the dots-and-dashes of Morse code, however, Laxton managed to acquire a scarce vacuum tube from General Electric, which made audio transmissions possible.\\"WBT Third Broadcasting Station to be Licensed\\", Charlotte Observer, March 20, 1927, Section 3, page 6. The three decided to set up a transmitterSome newspaper accounts state that the call sign for Laxton's home amateur station was either 4BX (\\"Mayor Gets Wireless Message From Harding\\", Charlotte Observer, February 22, 1921, page 4) or 4CL (\\"WBT Third Broadcasting Station to be Licensed\\", Charlotte Observer, March 20, 1927, Section 3, page 6). However, official government station lists report that these call signs were actually assigned to individuals in other communities. As of June 30, 1920, Laxton's station is listed in the annual government report as 4DD, located at 905 Realty Building in Charlotte, with Frank L. Bunker assigned 4CE at 734 East 4th Street, and Earle J. Gluck assigned 4CQ at 1418 East 7th Street. (\\"Amateur Stations: Fourth District\\", Amateur Radio Stations of the United States (Edition June 30, 1920), page 59.) The November 1920 issue of QST magazine also stated that Laxton's call sign was 4DD. (\\"The Operating Department\\", (Roanoke Division), QST, November 1920, page 30). in an abandoned chicken coup located behind Laxton's home at 2462 Mecklenburg Avenue, with a microphone line running to the home's living room.Wallace (1962) page 60. Laxton's daughter later remembered being drafted as a child to repeatedly count into the microphone for the early test transmissions.\\"First Broadcast Recalled\\" by Dick Banks, Charlotte Observer, April 9, 1967, page 5-A. These initial transmissions eventually were expanded into the playing of phonograph records, which resulted in enough interest from local amateurs, as well as technically advanced members of the general public, that a regular schedule of broadcasts was established. In late 1920 the station was issued an Experimental radio station license to Fred Laxton, located at his home address, with the call sign 4XD.\\"QST's Directory of Calls\\" (Fourth District), QST, January 1921, page 53.\\"New Stations: Special Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, June 1, 1921, page 3. The \\"4\\" in 4XD's call sign indicated that the station was located in the 4th Radio Inspection district, while the \\"X\\" signified that it was operating under an experimental station license. The growing interest in radio led to the December 1921 founding of the Southern Radio Corporation, located in the Realty Building, in order to sell radio parts and equipment. The initial officers were Fred Laxton, president, J. B. Marshall, vice president, and Frank Bunker, commercial engineer in charge. It was also announced at this time that the company planned to installed a transmitter and rooftop antenna at the Realty building, to be used for \\"sending out concerts, big speeches and other entertainment to those who own home outfits within a radius of 200 miles from Charlotte\\".\\"Radio 'Phone Station Here\\", Charlotte Observer, December 21, 1921, page 13. =Early years= Little-Long Company advertisement for a crystal radio receiver capable of picking up WBT's programs (October 1922) Initially there were no specific standards in the United States for radio stations making transmissions intended for the general public, and numerous stations under various classifications made entertainment broadcasts. However, effective December 1, 1921, the Department of Commerce, the regulators of radio at this time, adopted a regulation that formally created a broadcasting station category, and stations were now required to hold a Limited Commercial license authorizing operation on wavelengths of 360 meters for \\"entertainment\\" broadcasts or 485 meters for \\"market and weather reports\\" (833 and 619 kHz).\\"Miscellaneous: Amendments to Regulations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, January 3, 1922, page 10. The Southern Radio Corporation was issued a \\"provisional\\" broadcasting station license, with the randomly assigned call letters WBT, on March 18, 1922, which authorized broadcasts on the 360 meter entertainment wavelength.\\"New Stations: Commercial Land Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, April 1, 1922, page 2. Limited Commercial license, serial #341, issued March 18, 1922 to the Southern Radio Corporation for broadcasting on 360 meters (833 kHz) for a three-month period. (A 1927 Charlotte Observer account claimed that \\"the station became duly licensed and authorized in December, 1920, with the call WBT\\" and \\"was the third licensed station in the world\\" (\\"WBT Third Broadcasting Station to be Licensed\\", Charlotte Observer, March 20, 1927, Section 3, page 6), but contemporary accounts do not support either of these claims.) WBT made its first broadcast four days later on March 22. The next day's Charlotte Observer reported that: \\"Erected by the Southern Radio corporation of this city and attached to the Realty building, this station, officially designated as WBT, operating on a 360 meter wavelength, this station will arrange musical concerts, addresses on various subjects and will give nightly programs for the benefit of approximately 20,000 receiving stations within a hearing radius. The first program was given last night and several stations in this section are known to have picked up the Victrola music broadcasted.\\" This article further described the \\"wireless telephone broadcasting station\\" as \\"the first station that has been erected and put in active operating condition in the Carolinas. A station has been erected at State college in West Raleigh, but it did not work properly and it will probably be a few weeks before it will be in a position to do any broadcasting.\\" On April 11, following a successful inspection by the Fourth Radio District inspector, Walter Van Nostrand, Jr on April 4, 1922, the license's \\"provisional\\" qualifier was removed.\\" In October 1925, Fred Laxton sold the Southern Radio Corporation to the Carolina States Electric Company for approximately $50,000, while retaining control of WBT.\\"Southern Radio Sells Out Here\\", Charlotte Observer, August 29, 1925, page 3. However, the next month the station was sold to Charlotte Buick automobile dealer C. C. Coddington,\\"Radio Station Held For City\\", Charlotte Observer, September 16, 1925, page 20. who would promote both the radio station and his auto dealership with the slogan \\"Watch Buicks Travel\\". The station was moved to the top of the Coddington building, although Coddington later moved the transmitter site to farm property he owned on Nations Ford Road in south Charlotte, where it remains today.\\"Phenomenal Growth of Radio Broadcasting in Charlotte\\", Charlotte Observer, August 26, 1928, Section 3, page 7. On November 11, 1928, under the provisions of the Federal Radio Commission's General Order 40, WBT was assigned to a \\"clear channel\\" frequency of 1080 kHz, which gave it exclusive national nighttime use of that frequency. In 1929 C.C. Coddington sold WBT to the two-year-old CBS Radio Network. In subsequent years a series of power increases raised the station's from 5,000 watts to the maximum permitted, 50,000 watts. The 50,000 watt transmitter was dedicated on August 12, 1932. =CBS Radio and Amos & Andy= In 1925, Freeman Gosden and Charlie Correll started a comedy show carried by WBT that was a forerunner to Amos and Andy. Russ Hodges, later famous as the radio voice of the New York/San Francisco Giants, was sports editor of WBT for a time in the late 1930s, leaving in 1941 for Washington, D.C. During the Golden Age of Radio, WBT carried the CBS schedule of dramas, comedies, news, sports, soap operas, game shows and big band broadcasts to listeners in the Carolinas and at night, around the Southern United States. One musical program was \\"Arthur Smith and the Crackerjacks\\". Smith, best known for writing the song that became the Deliverance theme \\"Dueling Banjos\\", went to work at WBT at age 20 at the invitation of station manager Charles Crutchfield. He played guitar and fiddle for musical programs on WBT before getting his own show. Crutchfield believed that Charlotte, not Nashville, could have ended up being the country music capital because of the station's early \\"Briarhoppers\\" and \\"Carolina Hayride\\" shows, which may have inspired The Grand Ole Opry.Tom Minehart, \\"Country's Capital Could Have Been Charlotte\\", Chicago Tribune, November 19, 1985. In March 1941, as part of the implementation of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement, WBT was shifted to 1110 kHz, where it has been ever since. During the previous November 11, 1928 frequency reassignments, two midwestern stations, WBBM in Chicago and KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, were placed on the same frequency, 780 kHz, which meant they had to synchronize their programming during nighttime hours. In order to eliminate this restriction, in 1944 a reassignment plan was announced that moved KFAB to 1110 kHz, which in turn required WBT to start operating with a directional antenna at night, to limit its signal toward KFAB.\\"Controlling Interest in WBT Goes to KFAB in 3-Way Deal\\", Broadcasting, February 7, 1944, page 16. In order to mitigate the nighttime coverage loss, in July 1947 a 1,000 watt \\"booster\\" transmitter, located five miles northeast of Shelby, North Carolina, was authorized \\"for benefit of nighttime listeners west of Charlotte\\". (Use of the booster transmitter ended sometime in the early 1960s.) New FCC regulations forced CBS to sell WBT when the network reached the maximum number of stations it could own. In 1945, it was acquired by the Jefferson Standard Life Insurance Company, forerunner of Jefferson-Pilot, and became its flagship station. After the sale, it remained a CBS affiliate. In 1947, an FM sister station at 99.9 MHz was put on the air.Broadcasting Yearbook (1953 edition) page 220. But that WBT-FM was discontinued in the mid-1950s and is not same as today's WBT-FM 99.3, which first went on the air in 1969 as WCMJ, owned by the York-Clover Broadcasting Company.Broadcasting Yearbook (1971 edition) page B-185. In 1949, Jefferson Standard signed on Charlotte's first television station, WBTV.Kay McFadden, \\"WBT's Been on the Air for 75 Years\\", The Charlotte Observer, April 10, 1997. =Early hosts= Grady Cole was WBT morning host for 32 years, replaced in 1961 by Ty Boyd, who hosted the morning show until 1973, playing such artists as Duke Ellington, Peggy Lee and Petula Clark. Then he moved to WBTV to host television shows. He returned to WBT in 2008 to co-host the morning show while its regular hosts took time off.Mark Washburn, \\"Ty Boyd Will Be Back on the Radio Monday\\", The Charlotte Observer, July 5, 2008. =Changes in the 1970s= WBT was the number one station in Charlotte for many years. Among its employees were Charles Kuralt and Nelson Benton. But by 1970, WBT was down to number nine in the ratings, and national advertisers wanted ratings to improve. Jefferson Standard did not like the idea of change, but the company brought in researchers to show what programming Charlotte wanted. WBT let go 28 staffers and spent $200,000 on changes that included new studios. It also canceled many programs that advertisers supported but which didn't attract enough listeners. On March 15, 1971, WBT switched to adult contemporary music during the day. Rob Hunter and H. A. Thompson were new DJs. Bob Lacey started at WBT in 1972 with a nighttime talk show \\"Lacey Listens\\". Two years later, WBT had reached number one again, reaching the highest Arbitron numbers on record to this day. Around the same time, the station dropped its longtime affiliation with the CBS Radio Network and joined ABC Radio. WBT won Billboard adult contemporary station of the year in 1976 and 1978. In 1979, \\"Hello Henry\\" Boggan began his nighttime talk show. In 1978, Marty Lambert became Jeff Pilot, the traffic reporter for WBT and WBCY. Lambert became assistant program director and music director in 1982.Carol Hazard, \\"Former Jeff Pilot Lands Job As Merchandise Mart Official\\", The Charlotte Observer, June 12, 1989, p. 8D. =Talk shows at night= WBT dropped its ABC affiliation in favor of NBC Radio in 1987. Talk programming continued to increase on WBT through the 1980s, mostly at night. Larry King, on the Mutual Broadcasting System, moved from WSOC and stayed on WBT until 1987, when WBT decided its new NBC affiliation needed to take priority over other networks. Bruce Williams' syndicated financial advice show, part of the NBC Talknet block, replaced King. WBT expanded \\"Hello Henry\\" and its \\"Sports Huddle\\" program.Jeff Borden, \\"Larry King Dethroned by WBT\\", The Charlotte Observer, October 1, 1987. For their entire 14 years in Charlotte, starting with the inaugural 1988‚Äì89 season, WBT aired the games of the original NBA Hornets franchise. =Seeking more women listeners= WBT made changes to its format on December 10, 1990, hoping to attract more women. The station dropped James K. Flynn, Thompson and Tom Desio, generating numerous protests. Don Russell had hosted \\"Russell & Flynn\\" in the morning; the show was renamed \\"Russell & Friends\\". John Hancock became midday host, and WBTV personalities Mike and Barbara McKay began an afternoon program. Boggan, whose show had run in the afternoon, returned to his evening slot, replacing Desio, but was sometimes pre-empted by sports programs. WBT also switched its network affiliation from NBC back to CBS on December 21Tim Funk, \\"WBT Pair Lose Jobs in Shakeup\\", The Charlotte Observer, December 7, 1990.Tim Funk, \\"WBT Radio Lineup Seeks Change of Image\\", The Charlotte Observer, Tuesday, December 11, 1990. =Adding Rush Limbaugh= On September 3, 1991, WBT dropped the McKays and became the 400th station to air The Rush Limbaugh Show, which had already been heard in the Charlotte area on WADA in Shelby, WSIC in Statesville and WHKY in Hickory.Tim Funk, \\"Listen Up: From 'Radio Free Bubba' to 'The Shadow,' Area Radio's Ready to Turn You On\\", The Charlotte Observer, July 12, 1991.Diane Suchetka, \\"Rush Limbaugh's Replacing McKays on WBT Talk Show\\", The Charlotte Observer, September 2, 1991. In 1995, Jefferson-Pilot bought WBZK-FM 99.3 in Chester, South Carolina to provide a simulcast signal that better served the western part of the market at night. At this time the FM station's call letters were changed to WBT-FM.Tim Funk and Blair Skinner, \\"Family Sells Off WBZK FM\\", The Charlotte Observer, February 2, 1995. That same year the station began airing games of the NFL Carolina Panthers inaugural season until 1999, returning as the team's flagship station in 2005. Lincoln Financial Group bought Jefferson-Pilot in 2006. The merged company retained Jefferson- Pilot's broadcasting division, renaming it Lincoln Financial Media. In January 2008, Lincoln Financial sold WBT-AM/FM and WLNK to Greater Media of Braintree, Massachusetts. Lincoln-Financial then sold its three television stations, including WBTV, to Raycom Media‚Äîthus breaking up Charlotte's last heritage radio/television cluster. Greater Media had long wanted to expand into the fast-growing Charlotte market; its owner had wanted to buy WBT after hearing its signal at night on Cape Cod. =North Carolina Tar Heels= Also in 2006, WBT lost the North Carolina Tar Heels to all sports WFNZ. Sales director Steve Sklenar said the games pre-empted John Hancock's show and, during the ACC Tournament, Rush Limbaugh. WBT wanted the games, Sklenar said, but the pre- emptions cost the station advertising revenue. The Tar Heels had aired on WBT from 1977 to 1991, and returned to the station in 1995. According to Cullie Tarleton, who ran the station at that time, putting the Tar Heels on WBT was largely the idea of longtime coach Dean Smith, who wanted to tell recruits from New England that their parents would be able to listen to the games. On May 5, 2012, WBT signed back on with the Tar Heel Sports Network to be Charlotte's main carrier of the Tar Heels. After WRFX carried night basketball games for several years, WNOW-FM took over up until this year. With this switch back, games can now be heard all up and down the Eastern Seaboard at night, as WBT's clear channel signal can be heard from \\"Maine to Miami\\". =Programming changes= On June 8, 2012, WBT announced that The Brad and Britt Show, hosted by Brad Krantz and Britt Whitmire of WPTK in Raleigh, would be taking over the afternoon slot from Vince Coakley effective July 2. Krantz and libertarian Richard Spires had a show on WBT prior to 2003. In June 2013, the show moved to 6pm-9pm; Hancock would take over the 3pm-6pm afternoon drive slot. On November 15, 2013, both WBT and WBTV were dedicated with a North Carolina historic marker at the corner of Tryon Street and Third Street. The Wilder Building, which was demolished in 1983, hosted the WBT's studios from 1924‚Äì1955. The sign reads \\"WBT/WBTV ‚Äì Oldest broadcast stations in North Carolina established 1922. WBT radio long hosted live country music. WBTV sign-on, July 15, 1949. Studios here until 1955.\\" On March 3, 2014, WBT again dropped CBS News and returned to ABC News. In making the move, the station cited the stronger resources ABC's reporters provides to WBT's local programming compared to CBS and Fox News Radio. =Sale to Entercom= On July 19, 2016, Greater Media announced that it would merge with Beasley Media Group. Because Beasley already had the maximum number of stations in the Charlotte market with 5 FM's and 2 AM's, WBT-AM-FM and WLNK were spun off to a divestiture trust, eventually going to a permanent buyer. Beasley Acquires Greater Media On October 18, 2016, Entercom announced that it would purchase WBT AM/FM and WLNK, plus WFNZ. Entercom Acquires Beasley Charlotte Spinoffs Upon the completion of the Greater/Beasley merger on November 1, Entercom began operating the stations via a time brokerage agreement, which lasted until the sale was consummated on January 6, 2017. Broadcasting facilities WBT's diamond-shaped antennas account for three of only eight operational Blaw-Knox towers in the United States. In the morning hours of September 22, 1989, the high winds from Hurricane Hugo severely damaged two of WBT's towers and nearly killed then Chief Engineer, Bob White. The FCC approved WBT to operate at 25,000 watts with a non-directional pattern for the next year while the two damaged towers were rebuilt. Image:WBT-AM_tower_after_hugo.JPG1989 ‚Äì WBT's transmitter towers just after Hurricane Hugo Image:WBT-Towers.jpg2007 ‚Äì WBT's transmitter just south of Uptown Charlotte, North Carolina A single tower radiates the transmitter's full power during the day. The station's daytime coverage area is not as large as that of other 50,000-watt stations due to the area's poor ground conductivity. Even so, it provides grade B coverage as far as the fringes of the Columbia, Upstate and Piedmont Triad areas. Under the right conditions, it can be heard as far east as Fayetteville and as far north as Durham. At night, power is fed to all three towers in a directional pattern to protect KFAB in Omaha, Nebraska, which also operates on 1110 AM and employs a similar directional pattern that protects WBT to the east. Even though WBT must direct its signal north-south as a result, it can still be heard in parts of 22 states (including much of the country east of the Mississippi River) as well as portions of Ontario and Quebec with a good radio. It can also be heard in some Caribbean islands. Despite its clear- channel status, WBT was long plagued by marginal nighttime coverage in some parts of the Charlotte area, especially the western portion, due to the need to adjust its signal at sundown to protect KFAB. To solve this problem, WBT operated a synchronous booster signal in ShelbyFybush, Scott. WBT, Charlotte, North Carolina. 2003-05-15 from 1947 to the early 1960s. In 1995, then-owner Jefferson-Pilot bought WBZK in Chester, South Carolina, located 40 miles southwest of Charlotte, to provide a better signal to the western part of the market at night. WBZK's calls became WBT-FM. In 2012, sister station WLNK added a simulcast of WBT on its HD2 digital subcarrier. Past hosts Past hosts include \\"Hello Henry\\" Boggan, Ty Boyd, Grady Cole, Mike Collins, \\"Rockin'\\" Ray Gooding, Bob Lacey, Jason Lewis and H.A. Thompson. Don Russell is the station's longest-tenured personality, having worked at the station on six separate occasions since the 1970s. He currently hosts the weekend version of Charlotte's Morning News. From 2009 until March 31, 2011, Pete Kaliner hosted a local program in the 9-midnight slot, but was fired in a cost-cutting move by Greater Media. Neal Boortz's syndicated show was heard on tape delay from 9pm-1am; however, this was a temporary move as nationally syndicated host and former WBT personality Jason Lewis began to be heard on the station from 9-midnight (on a three-hour delay from his live broadcast) beginning in May 2011. Nearly two months after Kaliner's departure, Tara Servatius' contract was not renewed; Doug Kellett and Wayne Powers filled the 3-6pm slot on an interim basis while the station searched for a replacement. On June 22, 2011, former WSOC-TV lead anchor Vince Coakley, who had done fill-in work at WBT before, was named Servatius' replacement in the 3-6pm timeslot. Coakley left after a little over a year and was replaced on July 2, 2012 by Brad Krantz (a former WBT host) and Britt Whitmire, formerly of WZTK. Krantz and Whitmire, in turn, were fired by the station on June 11, 2014, and were replaced by John Hancock, who moved up from evenings (6-9pm) and a 6pm local news hour hosted by Mark Garrison and a local show with former WFNZ host Brett Jensen from 7pm-10pm. Coakley, who became the Republican candidate for North Carolina's 12th District U.S. House seat in 2012, returned to the station in 2017. In December 2012, morning co-host Stacey Simms left Charlotte's Morning News to spend more time with her family. On January 14, 2013, Charlotte native Doc Washburn, most recently a morning host at WFLF-FM in Panama City Beach, Florida, debuted in the 9pm-1am slot, bringing local talk to the timeslot for the first time in nearly two years, replacing Lewis and the retired Boortz. The show would be replaced by the nationally syndicated America Now with Andy Dean in May 2013; Washburn remained with the station as a fill-in host. Following Entercom's takeover of WBT via LMA on October 31, 2016, Keith Larson, the station's longtime 9am-noon host, was fired.\\"WBT parts ways with Keith Larson as station changes owners\\" by Mark Washburn, Charlotte Observer, October 31, 2016. The station ran a rotation of fill-in hosts while searching for his replacement before hiring former WPTF Raleigh morning host Scott Fitzgerald for the slot.\\"Media Movers\\" by Mark Washburn, Charolotte Observer, January 25, 2017.

Federal acquisition of land that would become the 1895 national park began on June 7, 1893, with 9 monument tracts of each and a larger 10th lot of from the Association, as well as from Samuel M Bushman. In addition to land purchases, federal eminent domain takings include the Gettysburg Electric Railway right-of-ways in 1917 (cf. 1896 United States v. Gettysburg Electric Ry. Co.).

Memorials and remembrance 1st Massachusetts Monument at Sunset 1st Minnesota Monument, Cemetery Ridge. The Park has been a highly symbolic venue for memorials and remembrance. On November 19, 1963 a parade and ceremony was held in Gettysburg commemorating the centennial of President Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, given less than five months after the Battle of Gettysburg. The actor, Raymond H. Massey, playing the role of President Lincoln arrived by 1860s period steam train at the Gettysburg station. He rode, in the parade as did Lincoln, on horseback to the National cemetery where actor Massey gave the President's famous address (this time for brevity, Edward Everett's preceding two hour speech was not read). The parade followed the same route that President Lincoln and Gov. Andrew G. Curtin took 100 years before. Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower‚Äîwho lived nearby‚Äîwas there accompanied by Gov. William W. Scranton. The attendance at the 1963 commemoration was lower than the 20,000 to 30,000 persons who attended the original address by President Lincoln in 1863. Thousands of photographers attended the 1963 event while U.S. Air Force aircraft passed overhead. Also attending the event were the 28th Division of the Pennsylvania National Guard headed by Maj. Gen. Henry F. Fluck, the U.S. Marine Band, and the 3rd Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard) of the U.S. Army.

There are 77 rock-cut caves at the site. Most have rectangular spaces with rounded arch ceilings often divided into four sections, each with a mural of the Buddha. The effect is of entire ceiling covers with hundreds of Buddha murals. Some murals show a large Buddha surrounded by other figures, including Turks, Indians and Europeans. The quality of the murals vary with some being artistically naive while others are masterpieces of religious art. The murals that best represent the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves are the large-sized murals, which were given the name the \\"Pra·πáidhi Scene\\", paintings depicting Sakyamuni‚Äôs \\"promise\\" or \\"pra·πáidhi\\" from his past life.The Lost Murals of Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves Professor James A. Millward described the original Uyghurs as physically Mongoloid, giving as an example the images in Bezeklik at temple 9 of the Uyghur patrons, until they began to mix with the Tarim Basin's original Indo-European Tocharian inhabitants. Buddhist Uyghurs created the Bezeklik murals. However, Peter B. Golden writes that the Uyghurs not only adopted the writing system and religious faiths of the Indo-European Sogdians, such as Manichaeism, Buddhism, and Christianity, but also looked to the Sogdians as \\"mentors\\" while gradually replacing them in their roles as Silk Road traders and purveyors of culture.Peter B. Golden (2011), Central Asia in World History, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 47, . Indeed, Sogdians wearing silk robes are seen in the pra·πáidhi scenes of Bezeklik murals, particularly Scene 6 from Temple 9 showing Sogdian donors to the Buddha. The paintings of Bezeklik, while having a small amount of Indian influence, is primarily influenced by Chinese and Iranian styles, particularly Sasanian Persian landscape painting.Sims, Eleanor, Boris I. Marshak, Ernst J. Grube, (2002), Peerless Images: Persian Painting and Its Sources, New Haven and London: Yale University Press, p. 154, . Albert von Le Coq was the first to study the murals and published his findings in 1913. He noted how in Scene 14 from Temple 9 one of the Caucasian-looking figures with green eyes, wearing a green fur-trimmed coat and presenting a bowl with what he assumed were bags of gold dust, wore a hat that he found reminiscent of the headgear of Sasanian Persian princes.von Le Coq, Albert.

The Buddhist Uyghurs of the Kingdom of Qocho and Turfan were converted to Islam by conquest during a ghazat (holy war) at the hands of the Muslim Chagatai Khanate ruler Khizr Khoja (r. 1389-1399). After being converted to Islam, the descendants of the previously Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \\"infidel Kalmuks\\" (Dzungars) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area. The murals at Bezeklik have suffered considerable damage. Many of the temples were damaged by local Muslim population whose religion proscribed figurative images of sentient beings; all statues were destroyed, some paintings defaced and others smeared with mud, the eyes and mouths were often gouged out due to the local belief that the figures may otherwise come to life at night. Michael Dillon considered Bezeklik's Thousand Buddha Caves are an example of the religiously motivated iconoclasm against depiction of religious and human figures. Pieces of murals were also broken off for use as fertilizer by the locals. During the late nineteen and early twentieth century, European and Japanese explorers found intact murals buried in sand, and many were removed and dispersed around the world. Some of the best preserved murals were removed by German explorer Albert von Le Coq and sent to Germany. Large pieces such as those showing Pra·πáidhi scene were permanently fixed to walls in the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin. During the Second World War they could not be removed for safekeeping, and were thus destroyed when the museum was caught in the bombing of Berlin by the Allies. Other pieces may now be found in various museums around the world, such as the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Tokyo National Museum in Japan, the British Museum in London, and the national museums of Korea and India. A digital recreation of the Bezeklik murals removed by explorers was shown in Japan.Reconstruction of Bezeklik murals at Ryukoku MuseumRyukoku University Digital Archives Research Center Gallery Image:Turpan- bezeklik-desierto-d03.jpgView of the valley Image:Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves (23367458033).jpgView of caves Image:Bezelik Caves 01.jpgCloser view of caves Image:Turpan-bezeklik-pinturas-d02.jpgFrescoes of Buddhas Image:Turpan-bezeklik-pinturas-d01.jpgFrescoes of Buddhas Image:Uigure- bezeklik-17.jpgAn Uyghur prince Image:Museum f√ºr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 064.jpgUyghur princesses, cave 9, Museum f√ºr Asiatische Kunst Image:Museum f√ºr Indische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 063.jpgUyghur Princes wearing robes and headdresses, cave 9.

It occurs as a secondary mineral in mafic igneous rocks often filling vesicles along with zeolites in basalt. Unlike most localities throughout the world, the occurrence of datolite in the Lake Superior region is usually fine grained in texture and possesses colored banding. Much of the coloration is due to the inclusion of copper or associated minerals in progressive stages of hydrothermal precipitation. Botryolite is a botryoidal form of datolite.

Taliaferro (1880‚Äì1915) Walter Robertson Taliaferro (September 9, 1880 - October 11, 1915) was a pioneer aviator in the U.S. Army who died in a flying accident. After his first and last \\"loop the loop\\" in a Curtiss tractor biplane, the plane suddenly dove into San Diego Bay, killing him instantly. Biography Taliaferro was born on September 9, 1880, in Campbell County, Kentucky. He served as an enlisted man in the artillery for seven years before being commissioned as an officer in the 21st infantry in 1908. He did surveying work in the Philippine Islands and in 1913 was detailed to the Aeronautical Division, U.S. Signal Corps, for pilot training. Taliaferro was married to Leicester Sehon. He died on October 11, 1915, in San Diego. He was buried in San Diego at the Mount Hope Cemetery. Camp Taliaferro in Texas was named in his honor, as was Camp Taliaferro in San Diego. Records Taliaferro made an aviation distance record, flying 220 miles in about 3.5 hours. With Lieutenant Joseph E. Carberry, he set a new American altitude record for a plane carrying two persons of about 7,000 feet, although it was only a month until Carberry and another reached 11,690 feet. Taliaferro also achieved a flight endurance record in September 1915 of 9 hours and 45 minutes, before he ran out of fuel.

The LCI and PRT were both part of the reunified Fourth International. The International recognised the PSR as its Portuguese section. In 1998 Party renamed itself in order to join with some other left-wing parties in founding the Left Bloc (Portuguese: Bloco de Esquerda or BE). The organisation retains the acronym PSR, and has become the association \\"Revolutionary Socialist Politics\\". The historical leader of the PSR is Francisco Lou√ß√£, who would become leader of the Left Bloc. The party had never achieved parliamentary representation before the merger in the Left Bloc, although it may be considered the 3rd or 4th biggest left-wing Party in the country. In the 1970s In 1979, the Party ran in a legislative election for the first time, achieving 0.6% of the voting. In the next year, another legislative election took place and the Party achieved 1.0% of the votes. In the 1980s In 1983, the Party ran in the legislative election in coalition with the People's Democratic Union (Portuguese: Uni√£o Democr√°tica Popular or UDP) in some constituencies, receiving 0.4% in those constituencies and 0.2% in the others In 1985, after some splits, the Party gained a new life, mainly due to its anti-militaristic and anti-racist campaigns and in that year's election, the PSR got 0.6% of the vote. In 1987, the Party contested the first European Election held in Portugal, achieving 0.5%, and in the legislative election, achieving 0.6%. Also in 1987, the Party started publishing of the Combate (Struggle) monthly newspaper. In elections for the European Parliament of 1989, the PSR got 0.8%. In the 1990s In the legislative election of 1991 got 1.12%, the best result in the Party's history. It ran for the last time in an election in 1995, achieving 0.6%. Left Bloc In 1998, the party formed a permanent coalition with the People's Democratic Union, the Politics XXI and the Left Revolutionary Front, creating the Bloco de Esquerda (Left Bloc). In 2005, in the last congress in the party's history, it changed its status from a party to a political association, which became extinct in 2013.

The village is about above sea level. In 1870-72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Shutford like this: \\"SHUTFORD, a chapelry in Swalcliffe parish, Oxford; 5 miles W of Banbury r. station. It has a postal pillar-box under Banbury. Acres, 640. Real property, ¬£2,840. Pop., 386. Houses, 98. The living is annexed to Swalcliffe. The church was repaired in 1841. There are chapels for Wesleyans and Primitive Methodists.\\" Imperial Gazetter Of England, vol. VI, page 808 The name Shutford is derived from Scytta's Ford. In the fourteenth century the village was quite large. 20 people were assessed for tax in 1327. In 1377 there were 86. A fire in 1701 destroyed 24 houses. Some houses were rebuilt and modernised. In 1774 71 houses were recorded. In the Middle Ages there were 3 manors in Shutford. The manor house appears to have been built in the 16th century. In the Civil War, Viscount Saye and Sele supported the Parliamentarians. Plush and shag weaving was established in 1747 and became the village's main claim to fame. Church and chapel The Church of England Parish Church of Saint Martin dates from the 12th century, when it was built in the transitional style between Norman and Early English Gothic. The north aisle, two bays of the arcade between this aisle and the nave, and the lower stage of the bell tower survive from this period.Sherwood & Pevsner, page 766 In the 13th century the north aisle was extended eastwards with an Early English Gothic third bay. In the 13th or 14th century the nave was rebuilt in the Decorated Gothic style. The south windows, porch and doorway, chancel arch and east window all date from this period. The Perpendicular Gothic windows of the north aisle and the upper stage of the bell tower were added later. The church building was restored in 1841. Since 1955 it has been a Grade II* listed building. Shutford had a Methodist chapel. It is now a private house.Oxfordshire Churches website: Shutford History =Early Settlement= Iron Age barrows in the neighbouring villages of Sibford Gower and Swalcliffe, as well as the remains of an extensive Romano-British settlement, suggest that the area was inhabited from an early time. Shutford was not mentioned in the Domesday Book but was recorded as a settlement in the twelfth century under the name schiteford. Nearby Madmarston Hill, a late Iron Age hill camp, is the earliest known settlement in the (Banbury) hundred. It was probably occupied from the 2nd century B.C. until the 1st century A.D. when it appears to have been deserted, except for a brief period in the 4th century. The site was extensively excavated in 1957-58. Shutford also lies close to what is now known as Swalcliffe Lea and was one of the largest Roman occupation sites in the county, covering 50 acres. The site was occupied throughout the Roman period and possibly earlier. The settlement which was quite large in the 1st century A.D. seems to have declined in the second but flourished again in the late third and fourth centuries. From the 14th to the 17th centuries a medieval hamlet called the Lea stood on the site all traces of which have now disappeared. The site was excavated by the Oxford University Archaeological Society in 1958. A villa in the field to the south east of the township site and immediately to the east of Lower Lea farmhouse was excavated in 2000. =The Manor House= The manor house was built in the last quarter of the 16th century and is the main house of the former East Shutford parish. Built by Sir Richard Fiennes, the MP for Banbury, between 1580 and 1600. A distinguishing feature is the tall staircase tower. Although the Fiennes family never lived at the Manor it is said that just before the outbreak of the Civil War the Parliamentarian William Fiennes, Lord Saye and Sele drilled soldiers in the upper storey of the house (then one large room). In 1928 the architect Walter Tapper added a western extension and northwest wing. The manor house was once owned by the Saye and Sele family, whose seat is now from Shutford at Broughton Castle. =Plush Industry= From about 1750 Shutford was part of the Banbury area's plush industry.Emery, 1974, page 177 Banbury was the centre for dyeing, marketing and distributing, but yarn was sent out to surrounding villages where it was woven.Emery, 1974, page 178 In 1841 two thirds of all plush weavers in the country lived in the Banbury area and, of these, about a quarter were in Shutford.http://www.cherwell.gov.uk/shutfordpc/index.cfm?articleid=8204 By 1850 the industry in the rest of the Banbury area was declining under competition from power loom weavers in Coventry. However, Shutford remained in the plush trade by concentrating on the skilled manufacture of high quality plush for liveries, upholstery and furnishings. By 1910 the only handwoven livery plush manufacturer in the world, Wrench's, based in Shutford supplied plush for the coronation of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia in 1896, produced decorations at Windsor Castle for Queen Victoria and specially made liveries for royal courts all over Europe and for the embassies of China, Japan, Persia and the United States. Despite a disastrous fire at the factory in 1913, the industry was revived and enjoyed a degree of prosperity between the wars. After the Second World War, however, with supply, demand and labour problems, the owners decided to reluctantly sell up in 1948. From the collapse of the plush industry to the 1960s Shutford declined, losing its school, its public house, and for a time having no Vicar. Property and street names such as Weavers Row, Weavers Cottage and The Weavers Shop give an indication of the village's illustrious past. Amenities View above Shutford, 15 August 2004 Since this short period of economic decline, all of the derelict buildings have been rebuilt and restored and many new houses added to the village, predominantly built with traditional Hornton stone. One focus of the village is the George and Dragon free house pub and restaurant.The George and Dragon Many successful small businesses now operate from the village. It has a cricket club and thriving community association which organises sports days, carol singing, fetes and concerts in St Martin's Church. Shutford also has a Women's Institute.Oxfordshire Federation of Women's Institutes The small Post Office in Ivy Lane closed in 2005, and Shutford is now served by nearby . Sibford Gower post office.

It operated as a training field for the Air Service, United States Army between 1917 until 1919. It was one of thirty-two Air Service training camps established after the United States entry into World War I in April 1917.William R. Evinger: Directory of Military Bases in the U.S., Oryx Press, Phoenix, Ariz., 1991, p. 147. After the United States' entry into World War I in April 1917, General John J. \\"Blackjack\\" Pershing invited the British Royal Flying Corps to establish training fields in Texas for the training of American and Canadians volunteers because of its mild weather. After looking at sites in Dallas, Fort Worth, Waco, Austin, Wichita Falls and Midland, three sites were established in 1917 in the Fort Worth vicinity (known as the \\"Flying Triangle.\\"), those being Hicks Field (#1), Barron Field (#2), and Benbrook Field (#3). Canadians named the training complex Camp Taliaferro after Walter Taliaferro, a US aviator who had been killed in an accident. Camp Taliaferro was headquartered under the direction of the Air Service, United States Army, which had an administration center near what is now the Will Rodgers Memorial Center in Fort Worth, Texas. History Taliafero Field No. 3 was used by the Royal Flying Corps from October 1917 to April 1918 as a training field for American and Canadian pilots. It was then turned over to the Air Service, United States Army. The Americans renamed the field Carruthers Field after Cadet W. K. Carruthers, who was killed at Hazelhurst Field, New York, when he was struck by a revolving propeller on 18 June 1917.Location of U.S. Aviation Fields, The New York Times, 21 July 1918 At some point after July 1918 it was renamed Benbrook Field by the United States Army. =World War I= The Benbrook Field station area was located south of Mercedes Street in Benbrook. It occupied the area west of Winscott Road, being bordered on the west by Walnut Creek. A railroad spur connected with the Texas & Pacific line across Walnut Creek. Most of the 34 buildings and hangars were located in an area generally bounded by Mercedes Street on the north, Winscott Road on the east, Cozby North Street on the south, and Walnut Creek on the west. Benbrook was used as an aerial gunnery school for American & Canadian students. One particular Canadian aviator, Captain Vernon Castle, was already world-renowned as the famed dance team of Vernon & Irene Castle. Regrettably, he was killed in a plane crash at Benbrook Field during training exercises. Some witnesses believed that he deliberately crashed in order to avoid hitting another plane, and saved their lives. His burial was witnessed by thousands of mourners, who sadly watched the flagged draped casket pass in downtown Fort Worth. Even today, there is a street in Benbrook named in his honor.

Intermixed within the houses are small, broken, isolated concrete slabs, the remainders of wartime buildings and hangars. The last remaining building was an ammunition warehouse west of U.S. 377 that was demolished in 2004 to facilitate future commercial development.

Biography His parents (Stan Cripps and Grace Welch) moved him to 15 Broadwood View, Chester-le-Street: his mother died when Welch was aged 6. Welch grew up with his Aunt Sadie in Chester-le-Street, County Durham. After learning to play the guitar, he formed a Tyneside skiffle band called the Railroaders when he was fourteen. His Rutherford Grammar School friend Brian Rankin (later to be known as Hank Marvin) joined the group and they travelled to London in 1958 for the final of a talent competition. Although they did not win, they joined with members of other entrant bands and formed the Five Chesternuts with Pete Chester (born 1942), son of comedian Charlie Chester, on drums. On moving to London, Bruce and Hank Marvin briefly operated as the Geordie Boys before enlisting in an outfit called the Drifters. In September 1958 Welch and Marvin joined the Drifters, later to become the Shadows, as Cliff Richard's backing band. As well as success with the Shadows, Welch acted as producer for (among others) Richard and songwriter for his ex-fianc√©e, Olivia Newton-John. He also released a solo single, \\"Please Mr. Please\\", which was not commercially successful, though the song has been covered by several recording artists (most notably Newton-John, who would take it into the top 10 of the US pop and country charts in 1975). Welch wrote several number 1 hit singles for Richard and for the Shadows. Among tunes or songs written or co- written by Welch are the Shadows' hits \\"Foot Tapper\\", \\"Theme for Young Lovers\\", and \\"The Rise and Fall of Flingel Bunt\\", Marvin Welch & Farrar's \\"Faithful\\" and \\"My Home Town\\", and Cliff Richard hits \\"Please Don't Tease\\", \\"In the Country\\", \\"Summer Holiday\\", \\"I Love You\\" and \\"I Could Easily Fall (In Love With You)\\". He was the musical consultant for the West End musical Buddy ‚Äì The Buddy Holly Story. After the Shadows disbanded in 1990, with Marvin deciding to tour with his own band, Welch's plans for his own tours did not fully materialise until 1998, when he formed Bruce Welch's Shadows (originally called 'Bruce Welch's Moonlight Shadows' ‚Äì a name that was dropped after 1998). The group featured former Shadows bassist Alan Jones and keyboardist Cliff Hall, with Bob Watkins on drums. Phil Kelly and Barry Gibson (owner of Burns Guitars) shared lead guitar duties until Gibson's departure in 2000. Welch with Hank Marvin during The Shadows 50th Anniversary Tour in 2009 Shadowmania In 1998, he produced Shadowmania, a one-day show comprising various Shadows tribute bands, with his own band topping the bill. Due to the event's success he presented it annually until 2012, missing only 2004 and 2009 due to tours with the reformed Shadows. At Shadowmania 2011 he included a 'Tribute to Jet Harris', his former band member who had died from cancer in March of that year. At Shadowmania 2012, Phil Kelly could not appear because of illness and was replaced by session guitarist-songwriter Daniel Martin, and Justin Daish, leader of The Shadowers (Jet Harris' final backing band). Welch with Cliff Richard and Hank Marvin reunited for Richards 50th Anniversary Tour Honours  He was appointed OBE (Officer of the Order of the British Empire) in the 2004 Birthday Honours list for services to music.

He was the U.S. correspondent for the French political-investigative weekly Bakchich, for which he also wrote a weekly column, and he was also the Contributing Editor for International Affairs of Gay City News. Scott Tucker has called him \\"not only a left-wing critic of sexual and political conformism among sectors of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender movements, but ... also one of the notable public intellectuals of the civil libertarian left.\\" Professional An early member of the Dump Johnson movement, Ireland was recruited for the staff of the presidential campaign of the man who became the anti-war candidate of the Dump Johnson movement, Senator Eugene McCarthy, for whom Ireland coordinated the Mid-Atlantic region of states. Following the 1968 Democratic National Convention (at which he coordinated McCarthy's labor support and helped organize demonstrations by Convention delegates against police brutality targeting anti-war demonstrators) Ireland went to Long Island to help run the successful campaign for Congress by Allard Lowenstein, considered the principal founder of the Dump Johnson movement. After a stint as a journalist on the New York Post, when it was still owned by Dorothy Schiff, and then on the Community News Service (a short-lived wire service providing news of the black, Latino, and other minority racial communities), he resigned to manage the successful 1970 anti-Vietnam war campaign for Congress by Bella Abzug, making her the first left radical to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Vito Marcantonio. He also managed Abzug's 1976 campaign for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, which Abzug narrowly lost by 0.10 per cent of the vote to Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Ireland played a studio executive in Woody Allen's Stardust Memories. =Journalism= Having already worked briefly at the New York Post and Community News Service, Ireland returned full-time to journalism in 1977. In an obituary, Micah Sifry wrote that \\"It was said that he could have been the 'next Jimmy Breslin,' but I think Dougie was too pure about his politics to ingratiate himself with enough people to win that label.\\" Among his notable articles was a 1978 expose, daring for the time, of violence against gay men in the Ramble, known as a cruising area in Central Park in New York City. He lived for ten years in France, writing on European politics and culture for various publications, including English language Paris city magazine, Paris Passion magazine; and he continued to write frequently about French and European politics and foreign affairs. Ireland was an assiduous promoter in the United States of the work of the prolific young French philosopher Michel Onfray. Ireland was a columnist for The Village Voice, the New York Observer New York magazine, and the Paris daily Lib√©ration, among other publications. He was also a contributing editor of POZ, the monthly for the HIV-positive community, of the magazine In These Times, and the French satirical news website Bakchich. In the late 1990s, he was a contributor to The Nation. Sifry, a colleague of his at the time, wrote that \\"I think one of my most trying experiences as a young editor was being in the middle of his push to publish a damning indictment\\" of then-President Bill Clinton, and the editors' \\"discomfort with his ferocity and willingness to infer the worst from a mixed bag of solid facts and not-so-solid surmises.\\" However, Sifry added that Ireland \\"was more right than not ... in the grand sense.\\"'''' Since mid-2005, Ireland was the Contributing Editor for International Affairs of Gay City News, the largest LGBT weekly newspaper in New York City and in the U.S. =Criticism= Ireland's reporting on Iran in the several years after 2005 drew harsh rebuttals from a number of Iranian activists, as well as from Scott Long, director of the LGBT Rights Program at Human Rights Watch. They charged that Ireland and Gay City News generally were uncritical in relying on sources who maintained that two young men hanged in Mashhad, Iran in mid-2005 ‚Äì‚Äì after being convicted of raping an underage boy at a time when they themselves were underage ‚Äì‚Äì had in fact been involved in consensual sex. Long and some other human rights advocates criticized activists and reporters, including Ireland and controversial British campaigner Peter Tatchell, saying they were engaging in unwarranted speculation about the motives for the case. Ireland continued to produce articles claiming a pattern of \\"anti-gay\\" executions in Iran. However, no professional human rights organization ever endorsed these claims, or identified any recent case of persons sentenced to death for consensual homosexual conduct in Iran. Long and others became increasingly critical, charging that Ireland and others were making claims without evidence, and imputing a Western gay identity to Iranians coming from a very different cultural experience. The conflict between Long on one side and Ireland and Tatchell on the other side was at times vitriolic and led to a 2010 episode in which Human Rights Watch and Long apologized in writing to Tatchell. However, Long remained a critic of Ireland to the end, faulting him for relying excessively on single sources in his reporting, for intolerance toward Islam and for failing to understand complex international situations. In particular, Long claimed that Ireland had unduly promoted the career of the flamboyant Russian activist Nikolai Alekseev while ignoring other Russian groups. Alekseev had a record of erratic behavior and supporting far right-wing causes, and later engaged in anti-Semitic outbursts. Scott Tucker writes that \\"In his reports on the Russian gay movement, and especially of gay activist Nikolai Alexeyev, I found [Ireland] less reliable.... When he became increasingly confined by illness, he could not pretend to be a truly investigative journalist.\\" Personal life He was born in Duluth, Minnesota and later lived in Port Hueneme, California, where his father worked in the information office of the Naval Battalion Construction Center. Ireland developed polio as a child as the result of his Christian Scientist parents refusing to allow him to receive the polio vaccine. After nights out drinking with writers like Christopher Hitchens and Gore Vidal, Ireland gave up liquor. In his final years, Ireland suffered from diabetes, kidney disease, severe sciatica, and weakened lungs and progressive muscle deterioration related to childhood polio. He also survived at least two major strokes. He often felt too ill to leave his apartment or have company. Ireland died in his East Village home on October 26, 2013. Ireland's partner was Herv√© Couergou. He died of AIDS in 1996. =Activism= A severe critic from the left of President Bill Clinton's presidency, Ireland for three years wrote a syndicated Clinton Watch column. He wrote extensively in opposition to President George H. W. Bush's Gulf War, as well as President George W. Bush's Iraq War and War in Afghanistan. At an early age, Ireland was part of the early 1960s American New Left. He was a member of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), and was elected to its National Council in 1963 at the age of 17. He also spent a year on the SDS national staff, as Assistant National Secretary, in 1963-64. Ireland dropped out of SDS in 1966 to devote his time to electoral organizing against the Vietnam War. As a staff member of the New Jersey Industrial Union Council AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers Region 9-A, in 1967 he helped to organize the National Labor Leadership Assembly for Peace to oppose the Vietnam War. He was involved in the Gay Activists Alliance (GAA) and Gay Liberation Front (GLF).

Organoboron chemistry or organoborane chemistry is the chemistry of these compounds. Organoboron compounds are important reagents in organic chemistry enabling many chemical transformations, the most important one called hydroboration.  Properties of the B-C bond The C-B bond has low polarity (the difference in electronegativity 2.55 for carbon and 2.04 for boron), and therefore alkyl boron compounds are in general stable though easily oxidized. In part because its lower electronegativity, boron often forms electron-deficient compounds, such as the triorganoboranes. Vinyl groups and aryl groups donate electrons and make boron less electrophilic and the C-B bond gains some double bond character. Like the parent borane, diborane, organoboranes are classified in organic chemistry as strong electrophiles because boron is unable to gain a full octet of electrons. Unlike diborane however, most organoboranes do not form dimers. Synthesis =From Grignard reagents= Simple organoboranes such as triethylborane or tris(pentafluorophenyl)boron can be prepared from trifluoroborane (as the ether complex) and the ethyl or pentafluorophenyl Grignard reagent. The borates (R4B‚àí are generated via addition of R‚àí-equivalents (RMgX, RLi, etc.) to R3B). =From alkenes= Alkenes insert into B-H bonds of boranes in a process called hydroboration. The process involves anti-Markovnikov addition. Hydroboration of alkenes or alkynes with borane (BH3) or borane equivalents leads to the conversion of only 33% of the starting olefin to product after oxidation or protonolysis‚Äîthe remaining olefin is incorporated into boron- containing byproducts. One organoboron reagent that is often employed in synthesis is 9-BBN. Hydroborations take place stereospecifically in a syn mode, that is on the same face of the alkene. In this concerted reaction the transition state is represented as a square with the corners occupied by carbon, carbon, hydrogen and boron with maximum overlap between the two olefin p-orbitals and the empty boron orbital. =By borylation= Metal-catalyzed C-H Borylation reactions are transition metal catalyzed organic reactions that produce an organoboron compound through functionalization of aliphatic and aromatic C-H bonds. A common reagent in this type of reaction is bis(pinacolato)diboron. Reactions Boron‚Äìcarbon bonds are polarized toward carbon. Thus, the carbon attached to boron is nucleophilic. This property is harnessed to transfer one of the R groups to an electrophilic center either inter- or (more often) intramolecularly.Negishi, E.-i.; Idacavage, M. J. Org. React. 1985, 33, 1. In the latter case, the nucleophilic R group is able to undergo 1,2-migration towards an electrophilic carbon attached to boron. The resulting reorganized borane can then be oxidized or subjected to protonolysis to afford organic products: center =Hydroboration-oxidation= In organic synthesis the hydroboration reaction is taken further to generate other functional groups in the place of the boron group. The hydroboration-oxidation reaction offers a route to alcohols by oxidation of the borane with hydrogen peroxide or to the carbonyl group with the stronger oxidizing agent chromium oxide. =Rearrangements= Carbon monoxide is found to react with trialkylboranes. What follows is a 1,2-rearrangement whereby an alkyl substituent migrates from boron to the carbon of the carbonyl group. Homologated primary alcohols result from the treatment of organoboranes with carbon monoxide and a hydride.Rathke, M. W.; Brown, H. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967, 89, 2740. center =Allylboration= Asymmetric allylboration demonstrates another useful application of organoboranes in carbon‚Äìcarbon bond formation. In this example from Nicolaou's synthesis of the epothilones, asymmetric allylboration (using an allylborane derived from chiral alpha- pinene) is used in conjunction with TBS protection and ozonolysis. Overall, this provides a two-carbon homologation sequence that delivers the required acetogenin sequence. :600px =As reducing agent= Borane hydrides such as 9-BBN and L-selectride (lithium tri-sec-butylborohydride) are reducing agents. An example of an asymmetric catalyst for carbonyl reductions is the CBS catalyst. This catalyst is also based on boron, the purpose of which is coordination to the carbonyl oxygen atom. =Borates= Trialkylboranes, BR3, can be oxidized to the corresponding borates, B(OR)3. One method for the determination of the amount of C-B bonds in a compound is by oxidation of R3B with trimethylamine oxide (Me3NO) to B(OR)3. The trimethylamine (Me3N) formed can then be titrated. Boronic acids RB(OH)2 react with potassium bifluoride K[HF2] to form trifluoroborate salts K[RBF3] which are precursors to nucleophilic alkyl and aryl boron difluorides, ArBF2. The salts are more stable than the boronic acids themselves and used for instance in alkylation of certain aldehydes: :Alkyl trifluoroborates Batey 2002 =Suzuki reaction and related reactions= Organoboron compounds also lend themselves to transmetalation reactions, especially with organopalladium compounds. This reaction type is exemplified in the Suzuki reaction, which involves coupling of aryl- or vinyl-boronic acid with an aryl- or vinyl-halide catalyzed by a palladium(0) complex, {{NumBlk:\\\\begin{matrix}{}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\ce{{R1-BY2} + R2-X ->[\\\\underset{\\\\text{catalyst}}{\\\\text{Pd}}][\\\\text{Base}] R1-R2}\\\\\\\\\\\\ {}\\\\end{matrix}}} This reaction is an important method for making carbon- carbon bonds. Classes of organoboron compounds =Organoboranes and hydrides= Among the most studied classes of organoboron compounds have the formula BRnH3‚àín. As discussed above, these compounds are used as catalysts, reagents, and synthetic intermediates. The trialkyl and triaryl derivatives feature trigonal planar boron center that is typically only weakly Lewis acidic. Except for a few very bulky derivatives, the hydrides (BRnH3‚àín for n = 1 or 2) exist as dimers, reminiscent of the structure of diborane itself. Trisubstituted derivatives, e.g. triethylboron are monomers.Brown, H. C. ‚ÄúOrganic Syntheses via Boranes‚Äù John Wiley & Sons, Inc. New York: 1975. . Structure of a rare monomeric boron hydride, R = i-Pr. =Borinic and boronic acids and esters (BRn(OR)3-n)= Compounds of the type BRn(OR)3-n are called borinic esters (n = 2), boronic esters (n = 1), and borates (n = 0). Boronic acids are used in Suzuki reaction. Trimethyl borate, which is debatably not an organoboron compound, is an intermediate in the production of sodium borohydride. =Boron clusters= Boron is renowned for forming cluster compounds, e.g. dodecaborate [B12H12]2-. Many organic derivatives are known for such clusters. One example is [B12(CH3)12]2- and its radical derivative [B12(CH3)12]‚àí. Related cluster compounds with carbon vertices are called carboranes. The best known is orthocarborane, with the formula C2B10H12. Although they have few commercial applications, carboranes have attracted much attention because they are so structurally unusual. Anionic derivatives, dicarbollides, e.g., [C2B9H11]2‚àí are ligands that behave like cyclopentadienide. =Bora-substituted aromatic compounds= In borabenzene, one CH center in benzene is replaced by boron. These compounds are invariably isolated as adducts, e.g., C5H5B-pyridine. The cyclic compound borole, a structural analog of pyrrole, has not been isolated, but substituted derivatives known as boroles are known. The cyclic compound borepin is aromatic. =Boryl compounds= Boryl anions have the formula R2B‚àí. Nucleophilic anionic boryl compounds have long been elusive but a 2006 study described a boryllithium compound, which reacts as a nucleophile: Organometallic compounds with metal to boron bonds, (i.e., M‚ÄìBR2), are known as boryl complexes. Related ligands are borylenes (M‚ÄìB(R)‚ÄìM). :Boryllithium The absence of lithium boryl compounds is notable because in other period 2 elements lithium salts are common e.g. lithium fluoride, lithium hydroxide lithium amide and methyllithium. The gap highlights the very low electronegativity of boron. Reaction of base with a borohydride R2BH does not result in deprotonation to the boryl anion R2B‚àí but to formation of the boryl anion R2B‚àíH(base)+. This reaction product has a complete octet. Instead the boryl compound is prepared by reductive heterolysis of a boron-bromide bond by lithium metal. The new boryl lithium compound is very similar to and isoelectronic with N-heterocyclic carbenes. It is designed to benefit from aromatic stabilization (6-electron system counting the nitrogen lone pairs and an empty boron p-orbital, see structure A) and from kinetic stabilization from the bulky 2,6-diisopropylphenyl groups. X-ray diffraction confirms sp2 hybridization at boron and its nucleophilic addition reaction with benzaldehyde gives further proof of the proposed structure. =Alkylideneboranes = Alkylideneboranes of the type RB=CRR with a boron ‚Äì carbon double bond are rarely encountered. An example is borabenzene. The parent compound is HB=CH2 which can be detected at low temperatures. A fairly stable derivative is CH3B=C(SiMe3)2 but is prone to cyclodimerisation. =NHC adducts of boron= NHCs and boranes form stable NHC borane adducts. Triethylborane adducts can be synthesised directly from the imidazolium salt and lithium triethylborohydride. Members of this compound class are investigated for use as reagent or catalyst. =Diborenes= Chemical compounds with boron to boron double bonds are rare. In 2007 the first neutral diborene (RHB=BHR) was presented by Gregory Robinson of the University of Georgia.Neutral Diborene Is A First Ron Dagani Chemical & Engineering News October 1, 2007 Volume 85, Number 40 p. 10 The boron precursor is boron tribromide and the reducing agent is KC8 which abstracts the required protons from diethyl ether solvent. Each boron atom has a proton attached to it and each boron atom is coordinated to a NHC carbene. The parent structure with the additional carbene ligands is diborane(2). :Diborene synthesis Wang 2007 A reported diboryne is based on similar chemistry. Other uses TEB ‚Äì Triethylborane was used to ignite the JP-7 fuel of the Pratt & Whitney J58 variable cycle engines powering the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.

They consist of a relatively level strip of land, called a ‚Äútread,‚Äù separated from either an adjacent floodplain, other fluvial terraces, or uplands by distinctly steeper strips of land called ‚Äúrisers.‚Äù These terraces lie parallel to and above the river channel and its floodplain. Because of the manner in which they form, fluvial terraces are underlain by fluvial sediments of highly variable thickness.Fairbridge, R. W., 1968, Encyclopedia of Geomorphology. Reinhold Book Company, New York.Blum, M., and T.E. Tonqvist, 2000, Fluvial responses to climate and sea-level change, a review and look forward. Sedimentology. v. 47 suppl. 1, pp. 2-48. Fluvial terraces are the remnants of earlier floodplains that existed at a time when either a stream or river was flowing at a higher elevation before its channel downcut to create a new floodplain at a lower elevation. Changes in elevation can be due to changes in the base level (elevation of the lowest point in the fluvial system, usually the drainage basin) of the fluvial system, which leads to headward erosion along the length of either a stream or river, gradually lowering its elevation. For example, downcutting by a river can lead to increased velocity of a tributary, causing that tributary to erode toward its headwaters. Terraces can also be left behind when the volume of the fluvial flow declines due to changes in climate, typical of areas which were covered by ice during periods of glaciation, and their adjacent drainage basins.Leet, L.D., S. Judson, and M.E. Kauffman, 1982, Physical Geology, 6th Edition. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall. Types There are two basic types of fluvial terraces, fill terraces and strath terraces. Fill terraces sometimes are further subdivided into nested fill terraces and cut terraces. Both fill and strath terraces are, at times, described as being either paired or unpaired terraces based upon the relative elevations of the surface of these terraces.Pazzaglia, Frank J., in press, 9.2.3 Fluvial Terraces, in Wohl, E., ed., Treatise of Geomorphology. New York, NY: Elsevier. Eroded alluvial fill 60 feet (18 m) thick at Kanab Creek, Kane County, Utah. In 1884 the stream ran at top of the terrace. 1939 photo by United States Geological Survey. Fill terraces: Fill terraces are the result of an existing valley being filled with alluvium. The valley may fill with alluvium for many different reasons including: an influx in bed load due to glaciation or change in stream power which causes the valley, that was down cut by either a stream or river, to be filled in with material (Easterbrook). The stream or river will continue to deposit material until an equilibrium is reached and it can transport the material rather than deposit it. This equilibrium may last for a very short period, such as, after glaciation, or for a very long time if the conditions do not change. The fill terrace is created when the conditions change again and either a stream or river starts to incise into the material that it deposited in the valley.Easterbrook, Don J., 1999, Surface Processes and Landforms, 2nd Edition. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall. Once this occurs benches composed completely of alluvium form on the sides of the valley. The upper most benches are the fill terraces. As it continues to cut down through the alluvium the fill terraces are left above the river channel (sometimes 100 m or more). The fill terrace is only the very highest terrace resulting from the depositional episode; if there are multiple terraces below the fill terrace, these are called \\"cut terraces\\". Hypothetical valley cross- section illustrating a complex sequence of aggradational (fill) and degradational (cut and strath) terraces. Note ct = cut terrace, ft = fill terrace, ft(b) = buried fill terrace, fp = active floodplain, and st = strath terrace. Cut terraces: Cut terraces, also called \\"cut-in-fill\\" terraces, are similar to the fill terraces mentioned above, but they are erosional in origin. Once the alluvium deposited in the valley has begun to erode and fill terraces form along the valley walls, cut terraces may also form below the fill terraces. As either a stream or river continues to incise into the material, multiple levels of terraces may form. The uppermost being the fill terraces and the remaining lower terraces are cut terraces. Nested fill terraces: Nested fill terraces are the result of the valley filling with alluvium, the alluvium being incised, and the valley filling again with material but to a lower level than before. The terrace that results for the second filling is a nested terrace because it has been ‚Äúnested‚Äù into the original alluvium and created a terrace. These terraces are depositional in origin and may be able to be identified by a sudden change in alluvium characteristics such as finer material. Strath terraces: Strath terraces are the result of either a stream or river downcutting through bedrock. As the flow continues to downcut, a period of valley widening may occur and expand the valley width. This may occur due to an equilibrium reached in the fluvial system resulting from: slowed or paused uplift, climate change, or a change in the bedrock type. Once downcutting continues the flattened valley bottom composed of bedrock (overlain with a possible thin layer of alluvium) is left above either a stream or river channel. These bedrock terraces are the strath terraces and are erosional in nature.Burbank, D.W., and R.S. Anderson, Robert, 2001, Tectonic Geomorphology, Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Unpaired fluvial terraces on the South Fork of the Shoshone River, Park County, Wyoming, 1923. The river at left has encountered a formation of erosion- resistant volcanic breccia, causing it to downcut more rapidly on the right, leaving terraces of different elevations. Paired and unpaired terraces: Terraces of the same elevation on opposite sides of either a stream or river are called paired terraces. They occur when it downcuts evenly on both sides and terraces on one side of the river correspond in height with those on the other side. Paired terraces are caused by river rejuvenation. Unpaired terraces occur when either a stream or river encounters material on one side that resists erosion, leaving a single terrace with no corresponding terrace on the resistant side. Applications Fluvial terraces can be used to measure the rate at which either a stream or river is downcutting its valley. Using various dating methods, an age can be determined for the deposition of the terrace. Using the resulting date and the elevation above its current level, an approximate average rate of downcutting can be determined.

Career Born in Aston, Birmingham, Henry attended the city's Alderlea Boys School in Shard End with Jeff Lynne. Henry trained at the Birmingham School of Speech and Drama, which was followed by eight years at the Birmingham Rep. Between 1975 and 1988, he played his best-known role of Benny Hawkins, a handyman in Crossroads. British Forces in the Falklands Island called the local islanders Bennys, after Henry's character, as many of them wore Benny-style woolly hats. In 1977, Henry recorded \\"Benny's Theme\\" with the Mayson Glen Orchestra, on Pye Records. It peaked at no. 39 in the UK Singles Chart in January 1978. He was in character as Benny in the song, but spoke rather than sang. Henry made a guest appearance on the Central Television games show Bullseye, presented by Jim Bowen, on 11 February, 1985. He scored 215 and raised ¬£215 for charity. His country-boy style gained him the part of Peter Stevens in The Archers for a time. Henry's post-Crossroads career included minor stage roles and running a nightclub in Whitchurch, Shropshire, but in 1994 he returned to television briefly in a tribute to Crossroads, called 30 Years On. In a 2002 interview, Henry declared that the public still loved Benny and that during a shopping trip, he returned to his car to find someone had left a piece of paper on it saying \\"Benny, we miss you\\".Paul Henry interview for the Crossroads Appreciation Society. Henry appeared in the episode \\"Stoppo Driver\\" in The Sweeney playing a gangster. In 2004, he returned to acting on TV in an episode of the British medical soap opera Doctors. He then played regular character Frank, a baker's delivery man and later attempted rapist, in the seventh and penultimate series of the ITV1 prison drama Bad Girls. Returning to the stage, in 2009, he appeared in a touring version of Run for Your Wife and the following year portrayed Tony Hancock in the play Hancock's Finest Hour. The slang phrase throwing a benny refers to someone having a temper tantrum and may originate from Henry's Crossroads character. Comedian Ronnie Barker revealed in his later years that he had suggested Henry be cast as the character Lennie Godber opposite Barker in the sitcom Porridge, but Richard Beckinsale was chosen instead by the television producer. In October 2017, Henry appeared on Celebrity Pointless alongside Shaun Williamson. They won the jackpot. Personal life Henry and his wife Sheila had a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Justine, who died as a result of a traffic collision at the age of 19.

UNITED was founded in 1992 (officially registered as charitable organisation under Dutch law in 1993) and provides a forum for active solidarity and cooperation between a wide variety of organisations in Europe and their activists across European borders. UNITED defines itself as pan-European tool to strengthen and cross-link grassroots organisations and their actions to improve their socio-political impact. The idea of the UNITED network was born by participants of two anti-racist European youth seminars in Strasbourg in 1992. At these occasions, the need for a European-wide info- and networking system was expressed against the background of the most violent and massive xenophobic riots that took place in Germany after the Second World War: the riot of Rostock-Lichtenhagen August 22‚Äì24, 1992. The work of UNITED mainly focuses on the coordination of European-wide awareness-raising campaigns, organisation of international conferences and the maintenance of an info-system and network structure. UNITED coordinates following annual campaigns: *European Action Week Against Racism *International Refugee Day *International Day Against Fascism and Antisemitism UNITED has participatory status at the Council of Europe, is often an elected member of the Advisory Council on Youth of the Council of Europe and has since 1997 special consultative status with the Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) of the United Nations. Campaigns Campaign logo of the \\"Action Week Against Racism = European Action Week Against Racism ‚Äì 21 March = In 1966, the General Assembly of the United Nations declared March 21 the International Day for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination as a reaction to the murder of 69 anti-apartheid demonstrators in Sharpeville, South Africa, in 1960.see UN Resolution 2142 (XXI) of 26 October; The first European-wide Action Week Against Racism on occasion of 21 March was organised by UNITED in 1993. Since then, UNITED coordinates the European-wide Action Week Against Racism on an annual basis with the aim to create public attention by stimulating and integrating different activities under the umbrella of a common campaign. UNITED doesn't organise campaign activities, but produces and freely provides so-called ‚Äúcampaign tools‚Äù and documents the campaign activities. The campaign activities are organised by independent organisations and groups all over Europe. UNITED collect these activities in an online map available at www.weekagainstracism.eu. In several countries, the idea of the annual Action Week Against Racism successfully developed into self-reinforcing tendencies, whereby local NGOs started to stimulate national action weeks. Since 2001, annual International Weeks Against Racism (German: Internationale Wochen gegen Rassismus) developed in Germany ‚Äì the main organisers of this campaign are the German NGOs Interkultureller Rat in Deutschland and Gesicht Zeigen. Semaine d'Actions Contre le Racisme, a Montreal-based NGO, organises a Canada-wide action week against racism since 2000. Other major groups that followed the idea and promoted the action week against racism around 21 March are the European Network Against Racism (ENAR) or Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE). Despite the fact that different national action weeks developed throughout time, all focus around 21 March and are related in their message. = International Refugee Day ‚Äì 20 June = Campaign logo of the \\"International Refugee Day\\" In 2001, a special UN General Assembly Resolution was adopted to declare the former African Refugee Day as the International Refugee Day as an expression of solidarity with Africa, which hosts the most refugees. The General Assembly noted that 2001 marked the fiftieth anniversary of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and that the Organization of African Unity (OAU) had agreed to have the International Refugee Day coincide with African Refugee Day on 20 June. UNITED coordinates an annual campaign around this date. This campaign aims to highlight the issues of refugees from a non-governmental perspective. The message of the campaign is carried by the monitoring results of the ongoing monitoring project Fatal Realities of Fortress Europe. Campaign logo of the \\"International Day Against Fascism and Antisemitism = International Day against Fascism and Antisemitism ‚Äì 9 November = On 9 November 1938, Nazi Germany started a pogrom against Jewish people. Jewish homes were ransacked, as were shops, towns and villages, as SA stormtroopers and civilians destroyed buildings with sledgehammers, leaving the streets covered in pieces of smashed windows‚Äîthe origin of the name \\"Kristallnacht\\", which freely translated means the Night of Broken Glass. 91 Jews were killed, and 30,000 Jewish men ‚Äì a quarter of all Jewish men in Germany ‚Äì were taken to concentration camps, where they were tortured for months, with over 1,000 of them dying. Around 1,668 synagogues were ransacked, and 267 set on fire. In Vienna alone 95 synagogues or houses of prayer were destroyed. The \\"Kristallnacht\\" pogrom is seen as the symbolic beginning of the systematic eradication of Jewish people which had started with the discrimination and exclusion of the German Jews since 1933 and which eventually led to the murder of millions Jewish people and so-called \\"enemies of the German state\\": homosexuals, criminals and \\"asocial\\" people, members of diverse religious communities, people with mental disabilities, political ‚Äòoffenders‚Äô such as communists and socialists, Spanish republican refugees, and minorities like Roma and Sinti and others. Since 1995, UNITED coordinates an annual pan-European campaign on occasion of the 9 November, called International Day against Fascism and Antisemitism. Hereby, the approach is two-fold: while one part of the campaign aims to commemorate victims of the \\"Kristallnacht\\" pogrom and, more broadly, victims of the Holocaust and of fascism throughout history; another part focuses mostly on contemporary issues of racism, antisemitism, right-wing extremism and neo-fascism. The campaign is joined by many different groups with independent actions which are collected by UNITED in an online map available at www.dayagainstfascism.eu.  Fatal Realities of Fortress Europe  Since 1993 UNITED has been monitoring the deadly results of the building of 'Fortress Europe' by making a list of the refugees and migrants, who have died in their attempt of entering the 'Fortress' or as a result of Europe's immigration policies. UNITED receives this information from newspapers, journalists, organisations working in the field of refugee and migrant issues, private researchers and governmental organisations. The figures given can only be taken as an indication of the true number of deaths. Each case published by UNITED is documented in the UNITED archives and the scientific part of the documentation can be requested by researchers and journalists to use it for their studies. By 2011, more than 15,181 deaths have been documented. The so-called \\"List of Deaths\\" plays an important role in UNITED's annual Refugee Day campaign and is also used as lobby tool. To measure the magnitude of the \\"war on migrants\\", OWNI ‚Äì an online information and news platform ‚Äì built an interactive map as an electronic memorial for these tragedies. The \\"List of Deaths\\" was also used in several art projects.  Publications  The European Address Book Against Racism is an annual publication that holds contact details and working-field information of organisations active within the scope of UNITED. The printed edition 2011 contained addresses of more than 2,480 organisations and magazines and 155 funding institutions. The searchable online version contains over 4,500 entries. The Calendar of Internationalism is published several times a year and holds information on events and trainings related to UNITED's working filed. There is also a weekly updated online version of the Calendar. On a regular basis, UNITED publishes Information Leaflets written by experts and activist within the UNITED working field. I CARE ‚Äì Internet Centre Anti Racism Europe I CARE - Internet Centre Anti Racism Europe is a web-portal featuring discussions and live reports on antiracism activities, mainly within Europe. ICARE is an information disseminator for the European NGO-community working in the fields of anti-discrimination, human rights, antisemitism, diversity and immigration, with a focus on anti-racism. ICARE is a NGO community networking system, an environment where large and small organizations can work on local, national, regional and international issues. The purpose of ICARE is the empowerment of democratic, non-violent Human Rights and antiracism work by offering information and reporting on events taking place, by facilitating communication, advocacy, campaigns and actions and by stimulating intersectional and international co-operation of NGOs. I CARE started on 1 October 1999 as a cooperation project of UNITED for Intercultural Action and the Magenta Foundation. The aim was to create a portal for anti-racism on Internet. Although the Internet opened-up the possibilities for collaboration with organisations worldwide, the decision was to focus on Europe, as both founding organisations basically work within a European context and because specific aspects of racism are still very much related to In \\"Real Life\\" culture, policies and practices. In September 2005 ICARE became a Magenta Foundation-only project. ICARE reported from the 2001 UN World Conference against Racism (WCAR) in Durban, offering critical appraisal of the conference ‚Äì which included the judgment \\"that racism was allowed to run rampant\\" and that \\"[w]hat happened in Durban [in 2000] should never happen again.\\"; the website continued to track developments regarding the Durban Review Conference 2009. In 2010, ICARE set out to establish a new service, the ICARE Hate Crime News. This service contains articles (English only) about hate-motivated incidents and crimes in the 56 Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) participating States and is updated almost every day with items from 'regular' news sources. Next to individual research, ICARE Hate Crime News makes use of crowdsourcing to collect incident reports. I CARE's secretariat states to monitor all contributions in order to be in line with universally recognised human rights standards. Incident reports need to be written in English language and include source and, if available, web location. For the definition of \\"hate crime\\", ICARE points to the working definition that was developed by the OSCE ‚Äì Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR). ICARE Hate Crime News contains articles from 1 January 2010.  UNITED Archives at IISH  UNITED cooperates with the International Institute of Social History (IISH), which is a research institute located in Amsterdam. The UNITED secretariat, also located in Amsterdam, has collectssince 1992 documentation of a wide range of European anti-racist and anti-fascist groups and of organisations in support of migrants and refugees since 1992. The archive was transferred to the IISH in 1998. It consists of correspondence with the connected organizations; questionnaires concerning the start of the network and documents concerning campaigns; documentation on ca. 300 anti-racist and anti-fascist groups and organizations; and documents relating to conferences organised by UNITED, with correspondence, documents concerning preparation, subventions, participants and accommodation.

The regiment traces its origins to the 18th century and has fought in every major campaign of the British Indian Army and the Indian Army, including the two world wars. Ethnicity of troops The Kumaon Regiment, established at Ranikhet in 1917, still gets its recruits from the Kumaon and other mixed recruits from the plains. The troop composition has been predominantly Kumaonis and rest of Ahirs along with various communities from plains. History Indian soldiers from the 6th Battalion, Kumaon Regiment pull security before entering a room while conducting company movement procedures with the United States Army during Ex. Yudh Abhyas 2015 at Joint Base Lewis- McChord, Washington. Soldiering has been an important profession of the Kumaonis and the region has a long history of warfare with neighbours, including the Nepal and Garhwal. The Kumaonis were never fully subjugated by the powerful Muslim dynasties of Delhi. They often offered their martial services as mercenaries, and fought on British side in the Anglo-Nepalese War. The Fierce fighting battalions of the Nizam of Hyderabad made up of Kumaonis and men from this region of the himalyan foothills formed a significant part of the strike force of Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army. Well before the split from royal gurkha rifles, the kumaonis had been enlisted in the five regiments of Gurkhas belonging to the Bengal Infantry and the Punjab Frontier Force. The Third Gorkha Rifles recruited heavily from the then greater kumaon kingdom(which included parts of terai presently in nepal) the large recruitment of Kumaonis led to this being known the Kemaoon Battalion. The Kumaonis were recruited in the military of the East India Company from the early 19th century. They often moved to other states in search of military service, including in the service of the Nizam of Hyderabad. The Nizam's Contingent was formed when Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, became Governor-General of India and formed a plan to rid India of French influence. His first action, on arriving in India in 1798, was to effect the disbandment of the Indian units of the Nizam under the command of Monsieur Raymond and officered by non- British Europeans. These soldiers were formed into the British officered Nizam's Contingent that fought at the Battle of Seringapatam in 1799 against Tippu Sultan in the final battle of the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War. In 1813, Sir Henry Russell, then British Resident in the court of Nizam of Hyderabad, raised the Russell Brigade comprising two battalions. Later, four more battalions were raised and they were known as the Berar Infantry. In addition, two battalions known as the Elichpur Brigade, were raised by Nawab Salabat Khan, Subedar of Berar, as a part of the Nizam's forces. The men of the Russell Brigade were chiefly Hindus, recruited from Oudh and other parts of Uttar Pradesh. Kumaonis, along with other North Indian classes served in the Hyderabad contingent which was raised, trained and led by British officers under Russell, but paid for by the Nizam of Hyderabad. By 1853, at the time of the signing of a treaty between the Nizam and the British, the Nizam's forces consisted of 8 battalions. The force was renamed as the Hyderabad Contingent, and became part of the British Indian Army, subsequently, becoming the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. Over time, the class composition changed to Kumaonis and Ahirs. During World War I, a Kumaon battalion was raised at Ranikhet on 23 October 1917 as 4/39th Kumaon Rifles. In 1918, it was redesignated as 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles and a second battalion was raised. These were merged with the Hyderabad Contingent into the 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1923. The first battalion of the 50th Kumaon Rifles survived to become the 1st Kumaon Rifles, and is today the 3rd Battalion, Kumaon Regiment (Rifles) of the Indian Army. Some units of the Berar and Elichpur infantry were demobilized after World War I. However, the Hyderabad Regiment was again expanded during World War II. On 27 October 1945, after the Second World War, the 19th Hyderabad Regiment was renamed as 19th Kumaon Regiment. Post-independence, it has been known as the Kumaon Regiment. Two state forces battalions, 4th Gwalior Infantry and Indore Infantry were allocated to the Kumaon Regiment becoming 14 Kumaon (Gwalior) and 15 Kumaon (Indore) respectively. The Kumaon Regiment has produced three Indian Army Chiefs: General Satyawant Mallannah Shrinagesh (4 Kumaon), General Kodendera Subayya Thimayya (4 Kumaon) and General Tapishwar Narain Raina (14 Kumaon). Affiliations *The senior battalion, 1 Kumaon, originally raised in March 1813 with \\"pure class composition\\" consisting kumaonis, was converted to the airborne role in 1946. It fought with distinction in the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 as 1 Kumaon (Para). It remained a part of the regiment until April 1952 when it was formally inducted into the Parachute Regiment as 3 Para(Russel‚Äôs vipers). In 2000, the battalion was converted to special forces as part of the expansion of the special operations forces of the Indian Army, and renamed 3rd Battalion para(special forces) or 3 Para (SF). Upon conversion to Para(SF), class composition has been made heterogeneous, consisting of men from all across India. *On 1 November 1970, the Naga Regiment was raised and affiliated with the Kumaon Regiment. The class composition of this regiment comprises Nagas, Kumaonis, Garhwalis and Gurkhas. *A Border Scouts battalion was raised and named as \\"Kumaon Scouts\\". *14 Kumaon (Gwalior), was converted to the mechanised infantry role, and transferred to the Mechanised Infantry Regiment, as its 5th Battalion. Engagements =World War I= During World War I, the first all Kumaoni battalions were raised. The first was formed in 1917 as the 4/39th (Kumaon) Royal Garhwal Rifles and redesignated in 1918 as the 1st Battalion, 50th Kumaon Rifles when it fought in the Battle of Megiddo (1918). A 2nd Battalion was also raised in 1918 but disbanded in 1923. The Hyderabad Contingent, with its mixed Kumaoni, Jats, Ahirs and Deccan Muslims, continued and fought with distinction in the Great War. In 1922, during the Indian Army reorganisation, the six regiments of the Hyderabad Contingent were renamed as the 19th Hyderabad Regiment and infantry companies formed from the Kumaon region replaced many of the Deccan Muslim-based companies. In 1923 the 1/50th Kumaon Rifles joined the 19th Hyderabad Regiment as the 1st Kumaon Rifles. In 1935 the battalion commanders attempted to have the regiment renamed as the 19th Kumaon Regiment, due to the diminishing links to the Deccan and Hyderabad regions. The request was refused. =World War II= The 19th Hyderabad Regiment in 1939 consisted of four regular battalions; the 1st (Russell's), 2nd (Berar), 4th and The Kumaon Rifles. The Hyderabads expanded during the war adding another eight battalions to the 19th Hyderabad Regiment. Two more battalions, the 1st and 2nd Hyderabad Infantry, were raised as part of the Indian State Forces. The battalions of the 19th Hyderabad Regiment fought in the Middle East, North African Campaign, Persia, Battle of Malaya, Battle of Singapore and Burma Campaign. The Kumaon Rifles were based in Hong Kong at the beginning of the Second World War but were transferred to the Middle East as part of the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade. The battalion took part in the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran in 1941 under Major-General William Slim. They remained in Persia as part of the garrison throughout the rest of the war. The 4th Battalion was part of the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade based in Malaya when the Japanese Army invaded in December 1941. The 4/19th Hyderabads were one of the few battalions in Malaya that were relatively well trained in jungle warfare. Although the battalion performed well in the fighting retreat in north-west Malaya, they were practically annihilated at the disastrous Battle of Slim River on 7 January 1942. The few survivors of the 4th Battalion were withdrawn to Singapore where they took part in the brief defence of the island before it surrendered on 15 February 1942. =Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48= 1 Kumaon(airborne) [now 3rd PARA SF] and 4 Kumaon was dispatched to Jammu and Kashmir to participate in the defence of Srinigar. 4 Kumaon elements were decisive in the Battle of Badgam. The valor of kumaonis saved kashmir from pakistani intruders, in recognition of the gallant action in kashmir, 1st and 4th kumaon were hailed as the saviors of kashmir and bestowed with the battle honor \\"Srinagar(badgam)\\". It was for this action that Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously awarded the Param veer chakra. It was a singular honour for the kumaon regiment to be the first to win the highest recognition for gallantry in the face of enemy. =Sino-Indian War of 1962= Battle of Walong (October 21, 1962 to Nov 16, 1962) On 21 October 1962, the Chinese attacked the Dhola sector in Arunachal Pradesh‚Äôs Kameng Division at a post at Kibithu (40 km away from Walong). The battle started by Chinese machine guns and mortars fire from south of Sama, followed by infantry attacks on two platoons with over 300 soldiers. It started at around midnight and went on for three hours. At about 5 am, the Chinese reinforced their assaulting troops and launched another fierce attack. About 60-70 Chinese soldiers died in that attack and four Indian soldiers were killed, including Vir Chakra awardee Naik Bahadur Singh, who took over the light machine gun (LMG) after his LMG detachment was killed, and kept firing till he was hit in the chest. In the days to follow, multiple such skirmishes and change in deployments took place, both from the Indian and the Chinese side. Acknowledging that Kibithu could not be defended, 6 Kumaon was ordered to withdraw to Walong. Ref Kumaoni Nostalgia! by Col N.N. Bhatia (retd) ‚Äú23 October marks a landmark win against the 153 Regt of PLA (Chengdu Sub area) when Delta Company of 6 Kumaon under Lt Bikram Singh Rathore (IC 11867) was ordered to establish screen position on Ashi Hill (NH 5484). Lt. Bikram Singh planned and executed a classic ambush at a small hanging bridge over Namti Nallah (5 km away from Walong). Lt Bikram removed the last few planks of the hanging bridge and positioned his men at various positions adjoining Namti Nullah and sighted the MMGs and Mortars of his men on spots likely to be enemy position and to bring down accurate fire. Lt Bikram Singh briefed his soldiers to hold fire until he fired the first ‚ÄòVery Light‚Äô. At 3 a.m. on October 23rd, the Chinese Army marching towards Walong walked down Ashi hill to reach the hanging bridge on Namti Nullah. The first Chinese soldier of 153 Regiment crossed the bridge and stepped on the last few plank and fell into the nullah. The following Chinese soldiers milled around and Lt. Bikram Singh fired the first Very Light revealing the Chinese in a cramped path of a planned accurate fire of Indian MMG and Mortar fire. About 200 Chinese troops were killed or wounded in this action against nine Indian fatalities. At 4 a.m. the screen by Delta Company of 6 Kumaon was ordered to withdraw.

On 5 November, there were multiple exchanges of fire between the Indian and the Chinese troops when a company under then Captain Ravi Mathur was asked to occupy Green Pimple and rescue an Assam Rifles patrol which was ambushed in the area. On 14 November 1962, 6 Kumaon attacked and captured Chinese defenses in the Walong sector, Arunachal Pradesh, without any artillery or aerial support. This was the only battle of the war in which an Indian unit attacked the Chinese, rather than defending. On November 16th, about 4000 soldiers of Chinese Army launched offensive against 120 soldiers of Delta Company of 6 Kumaon which was holding defence of West Ridge. Lt. Bikram was tasked to hold this defence at all costs till 1100 hours and he promised Brigadier N.C. Rawley that he would never withdraw & hold on till his end. Waves of Chinese attacks came on his post one after the other. However, Kumaonis fought gallantly and repulsed the attack. Then the Chinese fanned out and the next attack came with an overwhelming superiority of numbers from three sides (the forth side was a steep cliff), supported by machine gun fire & heavy artillery bombardment. The tenacity of the troops still prevented Chinese to capture West Ridge, however at a heavy price of precious & brave lives. By now, Lt Bikram Singh had held on to the post well beyond the assigned time of 1100 hrs. He was now left with handful of troops and all their ammunition was exhausted and had no logistical support. They then engaged in hand-to-hand combat, and fought to the last man and bullet. Five times as many Chinese soldiers died in this battle of November 16th on WestRidge. Only 17 Indian soldiers of Delta Company returned from this battle. The Chinese succeeded in retaking the defences when there was no Kumaoni left standing.The Battalion History - 6 Kumaonhttps://arunachaltimes.in/index.php/2018/07/15/heroes-of-1962-war-in- arunachal-6/https://usiofindia.org/publication/usi-journal/1962-war- operations-in-the-walong-sector-a-view-from-the-other-side-of-the-hill/ Five Vir Chakras were awarded to soldiers from 6 Kumaon for their actions in the battle; the battalion celebrates 14 November as Walong Day. Battle of Rezang La 120 men of C Company of 13 Kumaon, commanded by Maj. Shaitan Singh, made a last stand at the Rezang La pass on 18 November 1962. The area assigned to C Company was defended by three platoon positions, but the surrounding terrain isolated 13 Kumaon from the rest of the regiment. The Indian artillery was located behind a hill feature blocking the line of fire so the infantry had to fight the battle without artillery support. The Chinese suffered no such disadvantage and brought heavy artillery fire upon C Company. The Chinese attack, which was expected, came through a dry river bed. It was repulsed with heavy machine gun fire by the Indian soldiers. The Chinese regrouped and attacked persistently with more reinforcements. Maj. Shaitan Singh went from post to post raising the morale of his men and continued to fight even after being seriously wounded. Of C Company's 120 troops, 114 men were martyred, Of the 6 survivors, 5 were severely injured and captured by the Chinese. A memorial in Rewari claims that 1,300 Chinese soldiers were killed in the battle. Maj. Shaitan Singh posthumously won the Param Vir Chakra for his actions, the second for the Kumaon Regiment (the first being won by Maj. Somnath Sharma). Other soldiers defending Rezang La who were awarded Vir Chakras were Nk. Hukum Chand (posthumous), Nk. Gulab Singh Yadav, L/Nk. Ram Singh (posthumous), Sub. Ram Kumar and Sub. Ram Chander. =Indo-Pakistan War of 1965= Battle of Kumaon Hill Two Kumaoni Battalions continued to operate against the guerrillas. One Infantry Brigade was ordered to oust the enemy from the area, own side of a river and destroy the bridges. The enemy was holding the area with a company of 23 Azad Kashmir and one company of the Pakistani special forces unit - Special Service Group . Lt Col Salick decided to attack the feature with two Companies. It was to be a silent attack, though the battalion had adequate artillery support on call. The leading platoon under Jemadar Ram Singh hit an enemy minefield shortly after midnight on 21 September. Despite being wounded, this brave JCO pressed forward to find a way through the mines. At 7.45 AM the assaulting companies resumed the advance. Despite the heavy automatic fire that greeted them, the Kumaonis charged. In the initial assault, Capt (later Maj Gen) Surendra Shah, and his signaller were wounded. The fighting thereafter was fierce and continued for two and a half hours. Capt Shah was wounded a second time but he refused to be evacuated till the battle was over. The Kumaonis tenacity ultimately won the day and the hill was in their hands at 10 AM. For conspicuous gallantry in the action, Capt Surendra Shah received Vir Chakra. Another recipient of this award was Nk Chander Singh. In addition to these awards, one officer and two JCOs were Mentioned in Despatches. To commemorate the Kumaonis victory, the hill was named the KUMAON Hill. It was a significant achievement as a regular infantry battalion's Kumaoni troops ousted re-enforced enemy positions at significant heights occupied by better equip enemy special forces unit. This however was not the last encounter between the kumaoni troops and pakistani commandos as they faced off again on the icy heights of siachen in '84. Battle of Maharajke Another Kumaon Battalion captured \`Maharajke' in West Pakistan with a fierce attack during the night of 6 and 7 September 1965. On 13 September 1965, the Battalion attacked and captured village Pagowal an enemy stronghold which was 13 miles inside Pakistan . Not content with this, by 23 September 1965 (the day cease fire came into effect) the Battalion had made another deep wedge into Pakistani territory. Nk Ganesh Dutt was awarded Vir Chakra for his conspicuous bravery. The Battalion was also awarded four Mentioned in Dispatches and four Chief of the Army Staff Commendation Cards during these operations and was bestowed with the Theatre Honour ‚Äò Punjab ‚Äô. Battle of Chhamb To preempt Pakistani attacks into India, a Kumaon battalion advanced into the Mandiala Heights in West Pakistan at the end of August 1965. Before they had the chance to set up any defenses, the Pakistan Army began a major offensive in the Chhamb sector during the early hours of 1 September, accompanied by massive artillery shelling targeting the Kumaon battalion's positions. There followed an armoured thrust by two Pakistani armoured divisions. Faced with enemy advancing from 3 sides, the battalion held off for a day and a half. On 2 September, the battalion was ordered to withdraw after they had destroyed four Pakistani tanks. One Vir Chakra was awarded for the action. =Indo-Pakistan War of 1971= Kumaon battalions were deployed and fought on both the Eastern and the Western fronts during the war. =Operation Meghdoot= The Indian Army's initiative to hold the Siachen Glacier consisted of units of the Kumaon Regiment and the Ladakh Scouts. It was led by Maj. R.S. Sandhu, who was awarded the Vir Chakra for his leadership. Capt. Sanjay Kulkarni's unit was the first to land on Bilafond La and hoist the Indian tricolour. Kumaon units were instrumental in Indian success in capturing the glacier and repelling Pakistani attempts to retake it. Anticipating a Pakistani attack on the glacier at the start of the spring thaw in 1984, a full Kumaon battalion led by Lt. Col. (later Brigadier) D.K. Khanna, marched on foot with full packs and equipment for weeks in the dead of the winter across Zoji La, through the world's toughest terrain, highest altitudes and most forbidding climate. To their credit they achieved this without suffering a serious casualty or a single fallout en route. They also became the first battalion to operate as a unit in the Nubra Valley and on the Siachen Glacier. 19 Kumaon was the first battalion to hoist the Indian flag on the Saltoro Ridgeline (at Point 5705, an altitude of 18,717 feet) in the face of enemy fire, thus dominating Gyongla (18,655 feet) which was under enemy occupation. On 29 May 1984, 19 Kumaon lost 19 of its best soldiers, including one officer (2Lt. P.S. Poondir), who had volunteered to obey orders which they fully knew could take them to their certain death. During April and May 1984, 19 Kumaon was spread all through the area of Siachen with Capt. Roshan Lal Yadav at the Indira Col, Maj. Shashi Kant Mahajan and Maj. Darshan Lal Julka on the Central Glaciers (Gyongla, Zingrulma Lagongma, and Layogma Glaciers) and Maj. Rajender Singh Hooda in the Urdelop Glacier. 19 Kumaon was thus the first battalion ever to be spread out so much on the glacier (about 100 km), which, perhaps, no other battalion has been subjected to ever since.Gorichen to Siachen, The Untold Saga of Hoisting the Tricolour on Saltoro By Brig DK Khanna, VSM - Publisher Alpha Editions, Chapter 16, Page 116 Nk. (later Subedar/Honorary Captain) Ram Mehar Singh was awarded the Shaurya Chakra for his gallant role during the move. This turned out to be a vital move that enabled Indian victory in Operation Meghdoot. =Operation Pawan= Kumaon units were deployed to Sri Lanka during Operation Pawan. A Kumaon battalion was the first Indian Army unit to land in Jaffna at the Palali airfield. It successfully cleared the Kokuvil area, and moving to Mallakam. A number of LTTE militants were killed or captured. Another battalion was deployed to search and destroy LTTE camps in the Kumurupiddi and Irrakandi areas of the Trincomalee Sector. Among the areas in which Kumaon units were deployed and operated included Kilividdi of Muttur Sector, Sampur, Vellvutturai and Point Pedro. =Kargil War= Kumaon units were deployed during Operation Vijay to oust Pakistan Army regulars who had infiltrated the Kargil sector in Ladakh posing as insurgents. In difficult terrain and hostile weather conditions, they cleared and captured a number of altitude features. The regiment was honored with a number of gallantry awards for the operations.

The craft was the driving force behind the popularization of beachcats and was recently inducted into the Sailing Hall Of Fame. Introduced in 1971, the Hobie 16 is the second largest boat fleet in existence with over 135,000 boats built to date.Hobie 16 2012 class report 2012, International Sailing Foundation The boat is distinctly recognized for its asymmetric \\"banana\\" shaped hulls, designed to work without the need for daggerboards so the catamaran could be run up the beach without worry. The rudders kick up automatically by lifting up on the tiller crossbar. Design A de-rigged Hobie 16 Hobie 16 The Hobie 16 is manufactured in France by the Hobie Cat company, and by the Hobie Cat of America company in the United States. The Hobie 16 normally carries two sails, the mainsail and the jib. There is a kit to allow an H16 to fly a spinnaker but this is only class legal for youth racing. Each hull has two pylons (the forward ones are vented to allow the pressure inside the hull to equalise) and the frame fits onto these pylons. The frame consists of four aluminium alloy beams which slot into four aluminium alloy corner castings and are secured with rivets. The trampoline slots along the inside of the beams and is tensioned by rope or shock cord. Earlier masts were one piece, of aluminium alloy, but were changed to two pieces with a non-conductive composite fiberglass tip (known as \\"comptip\\"), after a few people in the United States of America were electrocuted trying to raise masts under power lines and their families sued Hobie Cat.St. Petersburg Times - Sep 28, 1977, \\"Electrocution Lawsuit is Settled Out of Court\\", Neil Skene, Staff WriterSunday Times-News - Feb 22, 1986, Henderson, NC, \\"Negligence Ruled in Lawsuit\\", Wilmington-AP The mast foot casting forms a ball which steps into a cup-shaped shoe riveted onto the forward crossmember and there is a Teflon disk separating the two. The downward compressive force from the mast is partially carried by the crossmember and partially by a stainless steel compression post and tensioned tie rod assembly called a \\"dolphin striker\\". The H16 may be equipped with two trapeze wires either side to allow both the helm and crew to trapeze. \\"Cat seats\\" can be fitted to allow disabled sailors to sail the H16. The rudder assembly consists of a rudder on each hull fitted to a Hobie-patented automatically releasing stock comprising a casting, a cam, and a spring-loaded plunger. This allows the rudders to spring up when they hit ground, to avoid damage. The rudders are connected to two short tillers which are in turn attached via a ball and socket joint to a connecting rod called the tiller bar. The tiller attaches to the centre of the tiller bar and is typically extendable for operation while trapezing. The mainsheet has a maximum of a 6:1 purchase and has a traveller that allows movement over the entire aft crossmember of the frame. The jib sheets are of a 2:1 purchase and attach on the front beams with their own two travellers. The boat has a 3:1 purchase downhaul (upgradable to 6:1) to tension the mainsail and an outhaul (standard 1:1, upgradable to 2:1) to flatten the mainsail along the boom. Both the mainsail and jib are fully battened.

Swansea () ‚Äì occupying a position at the mouth of the River Tawe and adjacent to an extensive bay at the western end of the Bristol Channel ‚Äì was the main town of its region for much of the Mediaeval period. In the 18th century, local dignitaries attempted to establish it as a tourist resort. The town achieved greater prominence with the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Mirroring similar population explosions in the South Wales Valleys, Swansea's population rose from 6,000 to 17,000 between the Censuses of 1801 and 1851. Industry grew throughout the 19th century, drastically changing the geography of the town and its surroundings. In the 20th century, industry declined but the town continued to grow in population. Swansea officially gained city status in 1969. Early history The oldest known remains on the Gower Peninsula are the Red Lady of Paviland: human bones dating from 22,000 BC.A Guide to Gower, Strawbridge and Thomas (eds), 1999, published by the Gower Society. Later inhabitants also left their mark on the land. Examples include the Bronze Age burial mound at Cillibion and the Iron Age hill fort, Cil Ifor.A History of Wales, John Davies, Penguin, 1990 Isolated prehistoric artifacts have been found in the area the city proper occupies, but there are far more on Gower. The remains of a Roman villa were also excavated on Gower. The Welsh name, Abertawe, translates to mouth of the Tawe. It first appears 1150 as Aper Tyui.See Place-Names in Glamorgan, Gwynedd O. Pierce, p 182. Medieval Swansea By the late 10th century, the region, including the land around the bay and the Gower, was part of the Welsh kingdom of Deheubarth under Maredudd ap Owain. The Vikings arrived sometime between the 9th and 11th centuries, leaving behind their name for a settlement in the area. The precise nature and location of this settlement are still disputed. Spellings such as Swensi, Sweni and Svenshi are found on coins minted around 1140,\\"A hoard of coins found at Rhiwbina in the north of Cardiff in 1980 contained ... minted at Swansea c. 1140 and bore abbreviated forms of the name: SWENSI, SWENS, SVEN, SWENI, SVENSHI.\\" Quoted from Place-names in Glamorgan, Gwynedd O. Pierce, 2002. ; pg. 182 In the wake of the Norman Conquest and Norman invasion of Wales, Gower became a marcher lordship which included not only the peninsula itself but also the land to the east as far north as the Aman river and east to the river Tawe. This included the site of Swansea town, which was designated the capital of the area. Although Kilvey Hill is to the east of the Tawe, the manor of Kilvey was also associated with Gower. The new Norman lords encouraged English immigration into the area. This immigration was largely from the West Country. A turf and timber motte and bailey castle was erected in Swansea in 1106 and was assailed by the local Welsh ten years later (and several more times in the following century). The original castle was subsequently rebuilt in stone. The Braose family--memorialised in local placenames and road names today as de Breos--possessed Gower in the 13th century but preferred to live at Oystermouth Castle. The Gower lordship seems not to have been the main priority of most of the family, who took a full share in the robust politics of the day: see Reginald de Braose, John de Braose, and William de Braose for further details. The port and industrialisation The South Wales Coalfield reaches the coast in this region, and coal was being exported by the year 1550, along with great quantities of limestone, quarried in the Mumbles area and on Gower and in high demand as fertiliser. Swansea was already a significant port, and although it was small (perhaps 1000 people in 1560), it had one of the earliest town charters granted in Wales and a constant influx of migrants from the Welsh countryside: this influx occasioned a protest from the borough of Swansea in 1603 (Davies, p267). The population at this time was concentrated around the castle and river. Despite small-scale coal mining, the bulk of the area beyond the town was still largely farmland. Swansea Bay was considered an attractive region. In the 18th century, some local notables wanted to direct future development into promoting it as a resort. Their plans were frustrated by the rapid development of industry in the area. By weight, more coal than copper ore is needed for the process of smelting copper from the ore, so it is more economical to build the smelter near the coal source. Swansea had very local mines, a navigable river, a nearby supply of limestone (necessary as flux), and trading links across the Bristol Channel to Cornwall and Devon, sources of copper ore. As the Industrial Revolution took off, a series of works were built along the Tawe river from 1720 onwards and a series of mines were opened. Initially, the smelting works concentrated on copper. Coal was brought down to them by waggonways and tramways; copper ore was brought on ships which could sail right up to the works; the resulting copper was exported out again. Swansea had become \\"Copperopolis\\", processing at its peak as much as 70% of the world‚Äôs copper, and the lower Tawe valley became a mass of industry. More and more riverside wharfs were built. Tramways, waggonways and railways proliferated and connected the different works and the collieries supplying them. Today's Hafod was originally the village of Vivianstown (Vivian & Sons owned the Hafod Copper Works); and Morriston was founded c. 1790 (the exact date is unclear) by the Morris family who owned the Cambrian Works among other properties. \\"By 1750, the Swansea district was providing half the copper needs of Britain\\" (Davies, p 316). The Cambrian Works closed down as a smelter but reopened as a pottery in 1764: pottery-making is another industry which requires vast quantities of coal (available locally) and clay and flint (available from the West Country, readily accessible by water). The Glamorgan Pottery was founded in 1813 by the ex-manager of the Cambrian Pottery, right next door to it and in direct competition with it. Not only the managers of the potteries but many of the workers came originally from Staffordshire.A Guide to the Potteries and Decorators Swansea Museum Services Examples of Swansea pottery can be seen today at the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery and at Swansea Museum One of the most well-known pieces of Swansea's history began life at this stage: the Mumbles Railway. This started in the first decade of the 19th century as an industrial tramway: a horse pulling a cart along tram plates. It had a specific branch line into Clyne valley where Sir John Morris, one of the railway's owners, owned coal mines. Despite some early journeys made by tourists, it was not until the 1860s that the railway began to carry passengers regularly, by which time it had acquired rails instead of tram plates. As the town expanded, gates put up by the local turnpike trust were no longer on the outskirts of town but in the town itself. Originally travel between Swansea and other towns or villages had involved paying tolls. Now, travel around the town itself required toll money. This was naturally an unpopular development, and in 1843, Swansea inhabitants made their own contribution to the Rebecca Riots, burning the Ty Coch gate in St Thomas. In the same year, workers from all the copper works in Swansea went on strike after their wages were cut. They returned to work five weeks later, having failed to restore their wages. The strike must have been born of desperation. It was known that John Henry Vivian, one of the owners of the copperworks, was no supporter of workers' rights: he had blacklisted men involved in earlier disturbances. Civil disturbances were a regular feature of the 1840s in Swansea. This was the period of the Rebecca Riots, of Chartism in the valleys to the east with the Merthyr Rising and the Newport Rising, and general discontent. Huge crowds would gather when those suspected of involvement in Rebecca activities were brought to the station house, and the riot was provoked when one suspect was arrested on the Sabbath (Molloy). At this time, Colonel James Frederick Love commanded militia who were billeted in Swansea, and (in 1843): Colonel Love had serious problems in deciding how best to stretch his resources. And stretched they were, because it was equally clear that Swansea needed to be strongly garrisoned to cope with violent incursions by unemployed coal and iron workers and discontented country-people, as would Llanelli when the Gwendraeth Valley troubles reached their climax in the following two months. And all the time the Chartist threat hung over the industrial areas to the east.And They Blessed Rebecca: an account of the Welsh toll-gate riots 1839-1844, Pat Molloy, 1983. . In this early part of the 19th century, the area which is now Brynmill, Sketty, the Uplands and the university campus was where several of the owners of the \\"manufactories\\" lived, in large park-like estates well to the west of the Tawe. The workers were crammed along the banks of the Tawe and lived in poor conditions. The prevailing wind carried the smoke from the copper works to the east, towards St Thomas and Kilvey. A contemporary report written by a doctor describing Swansea Valley speaks of a nightmare landscape, \\"literally burnt\\" where few plants would grow, dotted with lifeless pools, slag heaps, mounds of scoriae and smoke from the works everywhere.The Effects of the Copper-Smoke, Thomas Williams, 1854. George Borrow, later to write and publish his Wild Wales, visited the town in the same year, describing it slightly less emphatically as \\"a large, bustling, dirty, gloomy place\\". He was not convinced that Swansea people were in fact Welsh. \\"The women had much the appearance of Dutch fisherwomen; some of them were carrying huge loads on their heads.\\" The population of the town of Swansea had already increased from 6000 in 1801 to 17,000 in 1851 (Campbell). By 1881, the borough's population was over 65,000. Much of the growth was due to immigration - in 1881 more than a third of the borough's population had been born outside Glamorgan, and just under a quarter outside Wales.Rosser, C. and Harris, C.C. (1998) The Family and Social Change: A Study of Family and Kinship in a South Wales town. Routledge Writing in 1860, John Murray reports To the traveller who crosses the Llandore bridge at night, the livid glare from the numerous chimneys, the rolling, fleecy, white clouds that fill up the valley beneath him, the desolate-looking heaps of slag on either side, might well recalls Dante's line - \\"voi che entrate lasciate ogni speranza\\" and records there are no trees, and instead of grass a yellow sickly growth of chamomile scarcely covers the ground.A handbook for travellers in South Wales, John Murray, 1860. The contrast between the living conditions of workers and their employers the mine-owners and ironmasters was stark, although entertainment interests sometimes overlapped: both workers and employers flocked to the Swansea horse races, for example, held at Crymlyn Burrows. In addition to the racing, this was also the scene of boxing, gambling, cock-fighting, shows and drinking--apparently the temperance movement had not yet taken hold.Terfysg Abertawe, Robin Campbell, Swansea also became a focus for literary and cultural life in South Wales. In 1835 a philosophical and literary society was established, which became the Royal Institution of South Wales in 1841, based in the first purpose-built museum building in Wales. Swansea hosted the annual meetings of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1848 and 1880 (Miskell, 2004). Victorian slums and reform In order to allow boats to dock without running aground at low tide and to remain afloat, the \\"Float\\" was constructed: the Tawe was diverted and a new dock with locks created. Work began in 1852, and the result was New Dock in 1859. Further changes to the docks were proposed, and the town authorities realised the potential grave effect on public health, particular in the riverside St Thomas area.Slums: living conditions in the 19th century Swansea by Bob Dean: published by Swansea Museum Services. Drinking water came from springs locally but clean water sources were increasingly rare. Cholera broke out in 1832; and again in 1849. There was no sewerage system in Swansea until 1857 and the water supply in areas above the reservoir level was \\"in many cases of a questionable character\\" (contemporary report quoted by Dean). The Lliw reservoir of 1863 helped provide clean water, but drainage of dirty water was still a problem. In 1865, Swansea suffered an epidemic of yellow fever, the only outbreak of that disease on the British mainland. A cargo of copper ore from Cuba was landed in exceptionally hot weather in September, and with it a number of infected mosquitoes. In a month, 27 inhabitants were infected and 15 died. Swansea saw yet another outbreak of cholera in 1866 and the local authorities were eventually forced by legislation to act. The only way to improve some areas was wholesale slum clearance, and this was the solution imposed in several regions of Swansea, notably Greenhill (current Dyfatty and Alexandra Road area), an area with massive overcrowding and consequent disproportionate incidence of cholera cases. It was populated largely by Irish immigrants, many of whom had fled the potato famines. Several of the landlords of Greenhill making great profits from their rents, and who required recompense for the loss of their properties, were local dignitaries, including Lewis Llewelyn Dillwyn, MP. (Dean) Sewage and pollution were also part of the cause of the decline of the oyster trade centred on Mumbles, also known as Oystermouth. Kilvert's diary described a thriving and ancient industry in 1872; within five years, it had almost completely collapsed. Industrial decline The construction of the Taff Vale Railway and the Bute West Dock in the 1840s resulted in Cardiff surpassing Swansea as the principal coal port in South Wales, and by 1871 Cardiff's population exceeded that of Swansea. In the late 19th century, Swansea copper smelters faced increased foreign competition, and some of the leading smelters in the region diversified into other non-ferrous metals. In the ferrous sector, rapid growth in demand for tinplate - particularly in the USA - facilitated a local boom; the imposition of the McKinley Tariff in 1891 caused a significant fall in production, but tinplate continued to be a significant local economic activity into the first half of the 20th century,Miskell, L (2004) Swansea Bay 1904, Old Ordnance Survey Maps. England & Wales Sheet 247 with demand buoyant during the two world wars. During the Second World War, Swansea's Queen's Dock was one end of the world's first test of a full-scale submarine oil pipeline, in Operation Pluto. Swansea was a target for Nazi German bombing raids due to its industries, the port, and railways. By the end of the so-called Three Nights' Blitz, three consecutive nights of particularly intensive bombing in February 1941, the town centre was flattened, along with many residential streets. Rebuilding post-war was in typical British nineteen-fifties style and much of the result is regarded with high favour by neither residents nor visitors. One consequence of the bombing and rebuilding is the movement of the town centre by about half a mile. Pre- war, the town centre was on an axis around High Street and Wind Street. Post- war, Oxford Street and the new road the Kingsway took more prominence.Retailing The Mumbles Railway was closed in 1960. By 1960, industry in the valley was in steep decline and the landscape was littered with abandoned metalworks and the waste from them. The Lower Swansea Valley Scheme was started: an attempt to reclaim the polluted land into something usable. The Enterprise Zone at Llansamlet is built on part of this land. Further down the river, the Tawe was diverted--again--and the Parc Tawe development sits on top of the old North Dock. The old South Dock area now holds the Leisure Centre and Marina.

Construction of the stadium began in 1993, and it was complete and ready for the opening ceremony in July 1996, where it hosted track and field events and the closing ceremony.1996 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 1. p. 542.1996 Summer Olympics official report. Volume 3. p. 449. After the Olympics and Paralympics, it was reconstructed into the baseball-specific Turner Field, used by the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball for 20 seasons (1997‚Äì2016). After the Braves departed for Truist Park, the facility was purchased by Georgia State University, which rebuilt the stadium a second time as Center Parc Stadium, designed for American football. History Stadium during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. Seats in the background became the seating behind home plate for Turner Field and subsequently the south end zone for Center Parc Stadium. During the week-long athletics program, the stadium bore witness to Donovan Bailey of Canada winning the 100 m in a world record time of 9.84 s; Michael Johnson winning both the 200 and 400 metres titles, breaking the 200 m world record in the process; and France's Marie-Jos√© P√©rec also winning the 200/400 double. Meanwhile, Carl Lewis won his fourth consecutive Olympic title in the long jump, becoming only the second person, after Al Oerter, to win the same athletics event at four consecutive Games. After the closing ceremony of the 1996 Paralympics, the stadium was officially leased by the Atlanta Braves. Private entities, including NBC and other Olympic sponsors, agreed to pay a large sum of the cost to build Centennial Olympic Stadium (approximately $170 million of the $209 million bill). The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG) sought to build the stadium in a way that it could be converted to a new baseball stadium, and ACOG paid for the conversion. This was considered a good agreement for both the Olympic Committee and the Braves, because there would be no use for a permanent 85,000 seat track and field stadium in Downtown Atlanta since the 71,000 seat Georgia Dome had been completed 4 years earlier by the state of Georgia and became the home of the National Football League's Atlanta Falcons. The Braves had already been exploring opportunities for a new venue to replace Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium. The southwest corner of the Olympic Stadium was built to accommodate the future baseball infield and seating; in the Olympic configuration of the stadium, the seats are not placed next to the oval running track. The southwest part of the stadium also had four tiers of seats, luxury boxes, a facade facing the street, and a roof, whereas the north half of the stadium used a simpler two-tiered seating configuration. During reconstruction, the athletics track was removed and relocated to the field hockey stadium located at Clark Atlanta University, which uses it for athletics and football, and the north half of the stadium was demolished, reducing the capacity to 49,000. Because of the need to fit a track within the stadium in its earlier incarnation, the field of play, particularly foul territory, while not large by historical standards, was nonetheless larger than that of most MLB stadiums built since 1990. Reconstruction was complete in 1997, and the facility was renamed Turner Field. Afterward, Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium, the Braves' previous home and the venue for the Olympics baseball events, was imploded and the site became a parking lot for Turner Field. The Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority owned Turner Field, and the Atlanta Braves occupied the revised stadium until the expiration of their lease in 2016; the Braves moved to Truist Park in Cobb County in the following year. Georgia State University acquired Turner Field and its surrounding parking lots in January 2017 for a mixed use expansion of the Georgia State campus, which includes private and student housing, academic, retail, and office space in addition to the redevelopment of the former ballpark into Center Parc Stadium. The Atlanta Track Club's annual Father's Day four-mile (6.4 km) road race ends inside the stadium near the warning track where the finish line was located for the Olympics.

As not many records exist from the ancient monarchies of Xinjiang the study of its coinage has determined when which rules reigned and the state of the economy based on metallurgical analyses.  Pre-Islamic coins  A Yu Fang (‰∫éÊñπ) cash coin produced by the Kingdom of Khotan, illustrated by Aurel Stein. Among the earliest coins made in the Tarim Basin were the so-called \\"horse coins\\" of the \\"Yu Tian\\" kingdom near modern Hotan, also known as the \\"Sino-Kharosthi coins of Khotan\\".Cribb, Joe, \\"The Sino-Kharosthi Coins of Khotan: Their Attribution and Relevance to Kushan Chronology: Part 1\\", Numismatic Chronicle Vol. 144 (1984), pp. 128‚Äì152; and Cribb, Joe, \\"The Sino-Kharosthi Coins of Khotan: Their Attribution and Relevance to Kushan Chronology: Part 2\\", Numismatic Chronicle Vol. 145 (1985), pp. 136‚Äì149. These were struck around the second and third centuries with a horse image on one side and legends in Han (Chinese) and Kharosthi scripts. Coins with both Chinese and Karoshthi inscriptions have been found in the southern Tarim Basin. Cast coins made in imitation of Chinese coins were also produced in the Tarim Basin. The kingdom of Qiuzi (near modern Kucha) produced coins similar to the Chinese \\"Wu Zhu\\" pieces (see Kucha coinage). In the Chu valley in Central Asia Tang dynasty era Chinese coins continued to be copied and minted after the Chinese left the area. An indelible impression was left on eastern Xinjiang's administration and culture in Turfan by the Chinese Tang rule which consisted of settlements, and military farms in addition to the spread of Chinese influence such as the sancai three colour glaze in Central Asia and Western Eurasia, in Xinjiang there was continued circulation of Chinese coins. The title Malik al-Mashriq wa'l-·π¢ƒ´n was bestowed by the 'AbbƒÅsid Caliph upon the Tamghaj Khan, the Samarqand Khaqan Y≈´suf b. ·∏§asan and after that coins and literature had the title Tamghaj Khan appear on them and were continued to be used by the Qarakhanids and the Transoxania-based Western Qarakhanids and some Eastern Qarakhanid monarchs, so therefore the Kara-Khitan (Western Liao)'s usage of Chinese things such as Chinese coins, the Chinese writing system, tablets, seals, Chinese art products like porcelein, mirrors, jade and other Chinese customs were designed to appearl to the local Central Asian Muslim population since the Muslims in the area regarded Central Asia as former Chinese territories and viewed links with China as prestigious and Western Liao's rule over Muslim Central Asia caused the view that Central Asia was a Chinese territory to reinforce upon the Muslims; \\"Turkestan\\" and Chƒ´n (China) were identified with each other by Fakhr al-Dƒ´n MubƒÅrak ShƒÅh with China being identified as the country where the cities of BalƒÅsƒÅgh≈´n and Kashghar were located. Muslim writers wrote that \\"TamghƒÅjƒ´ silver coins\\" (sawmhƒÅ-yi ·π≠amghƒÅjƒ´) were present in Balkh while tafghƒÅjƒ´ was used by the writer ·∏§abƒ´bƒ´, the QarakhƒÅnid leader B√∂ri Tigin (IbrƒÅhƒ´m TamghƒÅj KhƒÅn) was possibly the one who minted the coins.

Islamic coins  In the Tarim Basin, (in present-day Xinjiang), Islamic, Arabic- language coins were struck under the Kara-Khanid Khanate, Chagatai Khanate, Sayyidiya (Yarkand or Moghul Khanate), and even by the Buddhist Dzungar Khanate.Reference Catalogue of Xinjiang Islamic Coins with photos The Dzungars minted p≈´l (a red copper coin).  Red cash (Qing imperial cast coins)  Guangxu era red cash coin with a nominal value of 10 w√©n. China's Qing (Manchu) dynasty began casting coins in the far-Western region of Xinjiang (Chinese for \\"The New Frontier\\", sometimes transliterated as Sinkiang) in 1760, only one year after the Qianlong Emperor's generals conquered the region's capitols of Kashgar and Yarkand. Not only did this primarily Muslim and Turkic-speaking region represent a distinct cultural landscape for the empire, but also a special economic environment. The many differences between the coinages of Xinjiang and the rest of China reflected the special demands of governing this area. The coins cast in Xinjiang were made from copper, rather than the brass used for the rest of the empire's coinage, leading to the nickname \\"red cash.\\" These copper coins were valued at five of the standard cash, and provided some continuity with the monetary system used under the region's previous rulers, the Dzungar Oirat Mongol Dzungar Khanate. Most of the red cash also displayed mint names in the local Turki language. The coins had writing in Chinese, Manchu, and Turki. Lying far from the empire's center, Xinjiang was somewhat loosely governed by the court, and this is reflected in the great variety of coin types produced, some of them quite innovative. In spite of frequent rebellions and invasions, the coinage of red cash continued on and off through the nineteenth century and into the beginning of the twentieth. The final examples of red cash were cast in 1909 in the name of the Last Emperor, Puyi, using the same casting technology employed by Chinese mints for 2000 years. The red cash of Xinjiang are quite popular among Chinese collectors for their abundance of unusual types, and for their connection to the Silk Road and Western Regions history and mythology. Some of the coins of Qing Xinjiang represent surprising breaks from Chinese coinage traditions. Most types are trilingual, and errors were abundant. Among the numerous types of red cash there are both great rarities and common pieces with strong historical significance.  Machine-made coins  cash produced during the Republic of China. Machine-struck coins were introduced in the late 19th century and at first were produced alongside the cast coins.

The company, distributed by Dwindle Distribution, has, since inception, been known for its humorous and satirical designs and has adopted a stylized panda as its logo. History =2000‚Äì2003: Formation, Hsu and Barletta= The company was founded in 2000 by professional skateboarder Marc Johnson with the support of Rodney Mullen‚Äîboth had previously been teammates in a company founded by Mullen and Steve Rocco (Rocco is the founder of World Industries and co-founded Dwindle Distribution with Mullen), the A-Team (later described by Johnson as \\"a completely fabricated team based on marketing\\";) In an online interview with the independent skateboard website, 48 Blocks, Johnson explained the dissolution of the A-Team: > Let's just say that parts of it were weird, but I already had a good > friendship with Gershon [Mosley], and of course [Dave] Mayhew from Maple, > and Rodney [Mullen] was just awesome in so many different aspects. So the > dynamic was fine. I think the problem was the lack of a solid direction, and > it seemed to me that A-team ended up being an avenue for some of us to later > do projects that felt more natural to us individually. When I called Rodney > to quit, it was actually really funny, because we all quit pretty much the > same week, but no one told anyone else they were going to quit. Johnson later revealed that both the panda image and the name \\"Enjoi\\" were derived from a dream that he experienced. The new company leader proceeded to recruit friends with whom he regularly skated with, including former Maple teammates, Jerry Hsu, Louie Barletta, and Dave Mayhew‚ÄîMayhew had also ridden for the A-Team (Mayhew's \\"D3\\" signature model skate shoe, produced with the Osiris shoe company, is considered the best-selling skate shoe of all time; however, Osiris cofounder/coowner, Tony Magnusson, denied this claim in a 2012 interview) Other professional skateboarders from this era of the company were Bobby Puleo and Chris Cole, who has won the highly regarded \\"Skater of the Year\\" award twice from Thrasher Magazine reflecting on the early stage of his career, Cole stated in a 2009 Thrasher interview: > I really like enjoi. The brand is a breath of fresh air. I was on the East > and detached from any team member so I was kind of a guy who rode the > products, but not on the team. Especially ‚Äôcause they are a group of > friends. I hung out with Marc Johnson a couple times. He was totally cool. I > have always been a huge fan of his, so that was great. Hsu was aged 15 when first met Johnson, who was 19 years old at the time. Hsu explained: \\"he [Johnson] seemed so much older, than, nineteen. I remember meeting him and thinking he was like twenty-eight, or something; like an older guy, just 'cause of the way he acted.\\" Hsu further explained that Johnson became a mentor figure to him and passed on insight that he had gained from being involved in the skateboarding industry. Regarding his time at the helm of the company, Johnson explained: > I had something to say; every month I had something to say. Whether it was, > like, a little weird or dark ... sometimes I would make an ad because I was > pissed off that day. I really like what I was doing at Enjoi, almost, almost > to a point where it became, like, obsessive.

Johnson later explained that the reason for his departure was that double-checking every brand decision \\"got really old, really fast.\\" Johnson also describes in a 2010 episode of the online episodic series, Epicly Later'd, produced by Vice Media, the period leading up to his decision to leave Enjoi permanently: > ... what am I killing myself for, you know?

They don't > give a fuck about anything you do.\\" Hsu has stated, on his behalf, that he did care when Johnson left and explained, \\"I knew he was unhappy, because he basically did all of the art direction, and he was being a pro skater, and he also wanted, it was like his little baby, so he was trying to take care of it, you know? And it was too much for him. He just wanted to skate.\\" Hsu further stated that he seriously considered leaving Enjoi after Johnson's departure and that \\"everyone knew that I wanted to leave\\". Eversole subsequently decided that he would assume Johnson's role and, according to Hsu, Eversole and Barletta met with Hsu in order to convince Hsu to remain with the company. Mullen cofounded the Almost skateboard company in 2004 (with fellow professional skateboarder Daewon Song) following his time with Enjoi. Enjoi released its first full-length video, Bag of Suck, in 2006 and won the Transworld \\"Skate Video of the Year\\" award in 2007‚ÄîJerry Hsu also won the \\"Best Video Part\\" award at the same ceremony. =2008‚Äì2013: Tweak the Beef, Hsu's departure= English skateboarder Ben Raemers was recruited as an amateur team member in September 2009. An introductory video was included in the \\"Fall 09\\" catalog. On December 17, 2012, an eighteen-minute video, entitled Tweak the Beef, was released by the company in conjunction with Thrasher magazine. A trailer was released on the Thrasher website on December 12, 2012, with the following brief: \\"The new enjoi video is shrouded in mystery, and there's rumors of total radness. Even we don't know what we're in for. We've got the exclusive premiere, Monday, December 17.\\" Upon release, the magazine introduced the premiere of the video with the following blurb: \\"If you ain't having fun, then what the hell are you doing? Enjoi these next 18 minutes. They may be your last...\\" The video was directed and edited by Enjoi's long-time brand manager, Matt Eversole, and features music from professional skateboarder, Tony Manfre, and American electronic music duo, Glass Candy. The video featured new amateur riders, Zach Wallin and Ryan Lay, alongside established riders, Ben Raemers, Clark Hassler, Cairo Foster, Caswell Berry, Louie Barletta, Jerry Hsu, Jose Rojo, Nestor Judkins, and Wieger van Wagenengin. Senior team rider, Hsu, is only featured briefly in the video, with his part incorporated into Barletta's section. Leftover footage from Wallin (\\"Zack's Delicious Doggy Bag\\"), Barletta (\\"Louie's Luscious Linguisa\\"), and Foster were also uploaded onto the Thrasher website. The origin of the video's title is alluded to in the introduction of the video, in which Berry is filmed performing a transitional trick known as a \\"Roast Beef Grab\\". Berry enhances the trick by emphasizing his movement while in the air‚Äîreferred to as \\"tweakage\\" by some sections of the skateboarding community. An off-camera voice during the trick can be heard exclaiming \\"Beef tweakage!\\" In a September 2012 interview for the YouTube channel, RIDE, Hsu and Barletta revealed that the company is due to release another video, as filming was occurring at the time of the interview (for the segment, \\"The Weekend Buzz\\", hosted by skateboarding journalists, Erica Yary and Rob Brink). Following the addition of Jimmy Carlin, a former rider for Jamie Thomas's Mystery brand, on September 3, 2013, Hsu announced his departure from the company. Hsu explained in an interview that was published on October 12, 2013 that his decision was spurred by the departure of longtime brand manager Matt Eversole who, according to Hsu, grew tired of protecting the brand from the profit-driven demands of shareholders. Barletta will take Eversole's place as Enjoi's brand manager and Hsu stated: \\"Louie understands what Enjoi is all about, so I think they can still make something really great and I wish them the best.\\" =2014‚Äìpresent: Oververt, New professionals, SOTY nomination, Panda Patrol= In May 2014, Carlin stated that he parted ways with Mystery‚Äîone of the brands within Jamie Thomas's Black Box Distribution company‚Äîwithout any plan on a future deck sponsor. Carlin explained that he found the work ethic at Black Box too intensive and is pleased that he was able to successfully negotiate a place on the Enjoi team, as he is friends with the other riders. In a July 2014 interview with Thrasher magazine, Foster explained that Eversole continues to work on the Tiltmode Army website, while Berry is struggling with a period of serious injuries. Raemers was assigned professional status by the brand in early October 2014. A congratulations video was published by CONS, the skateboarding arm of the Converse shoe company, on October 13, 2014, and features Raemers skateboarding in England. Following the publication of a trailer for Oververt on the brand's YouTube channel on October 8, 2014, the premiere date and location for Enjoi's third full-length video was announced: October 23, 2014, at Montalban Theater in Los Angeles, U.S. Barletta and Raemers appear on the cover of the December 2014 issue of Thrasher Magazine, corresponding with a feature article on the making of the video. At the end of his Oververt part, Wallin was assigned professional status by Barletta, who surprises him with a \\"Wallin\\" skateboard deck at the completion of his trick. The corresponding print advertisement featured the tagline: \\"help put clothes on zacks back buy his sticking debut pro models!\\" A video released on the YouTube channel of Thrasher Magazine revealed that Barletta was one of the contenders for the 2014 Skater Of The Year trophy, alongside Ishod Wair and Bobby Worrest, among others. At the conclusion of the video, Barletta revealed that Australian skateboarder Jack Fardell is newly sponsored by enjoi. The latest work from the Enjoi team comes in the form of a video series titled Panda Patrol. From 2017‚Äìpresent, the Enjoi team has uploaded a total of 10 videos to the Thrasher Magazine website, Thrasher Magazine YouTube channel, and Enjoi's own website as well. The videos feature the Enjoi team traveling to different areas such as, Taiwan, Lisbon, and Seoul, and vary on episode focus. Some episodes will focus more on a specific skater and other's will focus on the entire team. The first episode was uploaded in 2017 and the most recent was in 2020; the series has not confirmed an official number of episodes, and as of right now is still being produced. Criticism The brand was criticized by the Jezebel website in 2004 for a sexist joke written on a clothing label that read: \\"dirty laundry keeps women busy.\\" They have also been criticized on Amazon and other sites for the Jerry Hsu deck graphic depicting a girl with her arm in a sling and tears in her eyes saying, \\"I guess he really loves his enjoi deck more than me.\\" The negative implication being that he beat her because she wanted him to value her over skateboarding.

This colourless solid is used in organic chemistry as a hydroboration reagent. The compound exists as a hydride-bridged dimer, which easily cleaves in the presence of reducible substrates. 9-BBN is also known by its nickname 'banana borane'. This is because rather than drawing out the full structure, chemists often simply draw a banana shape with the bridging boron. Preparation 9-BBN is prepared by the reaction of 1,5-cyclooctadiene and borane usually in ethereal solvents, for example: 450px The compound is commercially available as a solution in tetrahydrofuran and as a solid. 9-BBN is especially useful in Suzuki reactions. Its highly regioselective addition on alkenes allows the preparation of terminal alcohols by subsequent oxidative cleavage with H2O2 in aqueous KOH. The steric demand of 9-BBN greatly suppresses the formation of the 2-substituted isomer compared to the use of borane.

In geology, a resurgent dome is a dome formed by swelling or rising of a caldera floor due to movement in the magma chamber beneath it. Unlike a lava dome, a resurgent dome is not formed by the extrusion of highly viscous lava onto the surface, but rather by the uplift and deformation of the surface itself by magma movement underground. Resurgent domes are typically found near the center of very large open calderas such as Yellowstone Caldera or Valles Caldera, and in turn such calderas are often referred to as \\"resurgent-type\\" calderas to distinguish them from the more common (but much smaller) calderas found on shield volcanoes and stratovolcanoes. The structure that makes a resurgent dome possible is a fracture zone made up of ring faults surrounded by concentric normal faults around the outside of the rings. During initial formation of the caldera these ring faults provide vents for ash-flow eruptions and are the point at which subsidence of the cauldron block occurs. Subsequent magma flows then push the cauldron block back up creating the dome. In the monitoring of volcanic hazards, resurgent domes are often intensively monitored, as an ongoing increase in elevation accompanied by seismic activity is certain evidence for magma rising beneath the surface.

He first toured Europe (Scandinavia) with the International Jazz Band in 1985 at the age of 16. On May 31, 1988, at the Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), Carter was a last-minute addition for guest artist Lester Bowie, which turned into an invitation to play with his new quintet (forerunner of his New York Organ Ensemble) in New York City that following November at the now defunct Carlos 1 jazz club. This was pivotal in Carter's career, putting him in musical contact with the world, and he moved to New York two years later. He has been prominent as a performer and recording artist on the jazz scene since the late 1980s, playing saxophones, flute, and clarinets. On his album Chasin' the Gypsy (2000), he recorded with his cousin Regina Carter, a jazz violinist.

It is located in the Midway Geyser Basin. Grand Prismatic Spring was noted by geologists working in the Hayden Geological Survey of 1871, and named by them for its striking coloration. Its colors match most of those seen in the rainbow dispersion of white light by an optical prism: red, orange, yellow, green, and blue. Grand Prismatic Spring History Aerial view of spring The first records of the spring are from early European explorers and surveyors. In 1839, a group of four trappers from the American Fur Company crossed the Midway Geyser Basin and made note of a \\"boiling lake\\", most likely the Grand Prismatic Spring, with a diameter of . In 1870 the Washburn‚ÄìLangford‚ÄìDoane Expedition visited the spring, noting a geyser nearby (later named Excelsior). Color Microbial mat The bright, vivid colors in the spring are the result of microbial mats around the edges of the mineral-rich water. The mats produce colors ranging from green to red; the amount of color in the microbial mats depends on the ratio of chlorophyll to carotenoids and on the temperature gradient in the runoff. In the summer, the mats tend to be orange and red, whereas in the winter the mats are usually dark green. The center of the pool is sterile due to extreme heat. The deep blue color of the water in the center of the pool results from the intrinsic blue color of water. The effect is strongest in the center of the spring, because of its sterility and depth. Physical structure The spring is approximately in diameter and is deep. The spring discharges an estimated of water per minute.

The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey, Randy Rose, and Norvell Austin, though Austin would soon leave. Condrey would go on to team with Bobby Eaton. It was at this point that Cornette became associated with the team. The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane (still managed by Cornette), compete in JCP and WCW and briefly feuding with \\"The Original Midnight Express\\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) featured Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \\"The New Midnight Express\\". Condrey, Eaton and Lane occasionally compete as the Midnight Express on the independent circuit. History =Dennis Condrey, Randy Rose and Norvell Austin (1980‚Äì1983)= In 1980 a new team was formed in Southeast Championship Wrestling In an attempt to throw Rose and Condrey off, Austin adopted the masked persona of \\"The Shadow\\" and together with Brad Armstrong defeated Condrey and Rose for the title on May 4, 1981. After losing the title back to Condrey and Rose on July 27, 1981, Austin turned on Armstrong and joined up with Condrey and Rose to form a stable (group) known as The Midnight Express. In the book The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams Condrey explains that the name did not stem from the movie Midnight Express (although later versions of the Midnight Express would use the film's theme by Giorgio Moroder as their theme music) but from the fact that they all dressed in black, drove black cars, and were out partying past midnight. Together the three men won the AWA Southern Tag Team title in the CWA and invoked a rule that allowed any two of the three men to defend the titles on a given night, so that their opponents never knew what combination to expect. The Midnight Express lost the AWA Southern tag team title to Bobby Eaton and Sweet Brown Sugar before returning to SECW in the spring of 1982. Upon their return to Southeastern Championship Wrestling the Midnight Express quickly regained the Southeastern Tag Team title from Robert Fuller and Jimmy Golden on September 27, 1982. The Express then became involved in a feud with the Mongolian Stomper and his storyline son \\"Mongolian Stomper Jr.\\", with whom they traded the Southeastern title. The Midnight Express's next challengers were \\"Dizzy Ed\\" Hogan and local wrestler Ken Lucas. The two teams repeatedly traded the title until the Midnight Express, using their 3-on-2 advantage, finally reclaimed the championship by the end of July 1983. The Midnight Express's final feud in the SECW was with the local heroes Jimmy Golden and Robert Fuller who managed to drive the group out of SECW. After dropping the Southeastern Tag Team titles to Brad and Scott Armstrong, Austin, Condrey and Rose went their separate ways. =Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton (1983‚Äì1987)= When Bobby Eaton was sent to Mid-South Wrestling under promoter Bill Watts as part of a talent trade it was decided that he should be part of the new version of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of Jim Cornette to form a new version of the Midnight Express. The Express had up until this point been a group of wrestlers, but once Eaton and Condrey joined together the Midnight Express worked exclusively as a two-man team. To complement \\"Loverboy\\" Dennis Condrey, Eaton was nicknamed \\"Beautiful Bobby\\", a nickname he still uses. The Express was first booked in a storyline with the Mid-South Tag Team champions Magnum T.A. and Mr. Wrestling II. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey tarring and feathering Magnum TA in the middle of the ring. Condrey and Eaton won their first tag team championship when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum TA and attacked him during a match, allowing The Midnight Express to walk away with the titles without much opposition. Collectively Dennis Condrey and Bobby Eaton hold the record for the most Tag Team Titles in all of professional wrestling with 53 together; earning the right to be called the most decorated Tag Team of all time. During the Midnight's Express time in Mid-South, Wendi Richter was made an honorary member by Jim Corrnette.WWE Network Wendi Richter vs Princess Victora See Title History below. With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. This team was The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Ricky Morton and Robert Gibson), with whom they started a long-running series of matches that would run well into the 1990s and span several wrestling promotions. The two Expresses had a series of matches which differed from the way tag team wrestling was presented at the time and drew attention both locally and nationally. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion to work elsewhere. The Midnight Express had a short stay in World Class Championship Wrestling in Texas where they feuded mainly with The Fantastics (Bobby Fulton and Tommy Rogers). When opportunities in WCCW looked to go nowhere the Midnight Express signed with Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) in 1985, giving them national exposure through JCP's television shows that were broadcast on SuperStation TBS. Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express from whom they won the NWA World Tag team titles in February 1986 on Superstars on the Superstation. Eaton and Condrey lost the titles back to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later. Besides feuding with the Rock 'n' Roll Express, Eaton and Condrey also had long-running feuds with The New Breed (Chris Champion and Sean Royal) as well as The Road Warriors (Animal and Hawk). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high-profile Scaffold Match at Starrcade 1986, which the Midnight Express lost. =Reformation with Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane (1987‚Äì1988)= In March 1987, Dennis Condrey suddenly left JCP without giving any reason, leaving Eaton without a partner. Bubba Rogers worked a few dates to fulfill obligations, but Dusty Rhodes made the decision to pick Stan Lane who was a singles star in Florida at the time. Tom Prichard was thought about but never officially suggested. Eaton and Lane reached the semi-finals of the Crockett Cup Tag Team Tournament on April 11, 1987 in Baltimore. On May 16, 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane won the NWA United States Tag team titles for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together. A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels as they won the NWA World Tag Team Titles from the Horsemen Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard on September 10, 1988 (Anderson and Blanchard left NWA to go to World Wrestling Federation). The Midnight Express's title run only lasted a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors (who had recently turned heel on Sting) took the gold from them in a brutal match. =Feud of the Midnight Expresses (1988‚Äì1989)= After leaving JCP in 1987, Condrey reunited with Rose in the AWA, where they won the AWA World Tag Team Championship, and were managed by Paul E. Dangerously and became known as The Original Midnight Express, since Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose first teamed up in 1980. In 1988, they went to Jim Crockett Promotions. Led by longtime Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, Condrey and Rose set out to prove they were better than the new version. Condrey's and Rose's surprise appearance gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but the promising feud was cut short when Dennis Condrey left the promotion once more before a \\"loser leaves town\\" match at Chi-Town Rumble. Rose teamed with Jack Victory and took the pin, leaving the promotion. Cornette contends in a shoot interview that backstage politics and animosity between the Original Midnights, promotion head Jim Crockett and head booker George Scott led to the feud being cooled off and Condrey once again leaving the promotion. =The Midnight Express in NWA (1989‚Äì1990)= Due to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane, and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner purchased the company and it was renamed World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match. The Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for $10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after. After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles. The Express won the titles from the young team in early 1990, but lost them to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. They were then defeated by Halloween Havoc 1990 by Tommy Rich and Ricky Morton. On October 29, 1990, the Express showed up to the next round of TV tapings only to discover they were not on the card for any of the shows. Since they were not told ahead of time, Eaton was unable to take the day off to spend time with his wife and children. Cornette, already frustrated over what he perceived as the burial of Lane and Eaton by WCW President Jim Herd, discovered the next day that the Express was booked for four matches at the October 30 taping session and they were to lose all of them. After confronting Ole Anderson, the booker at the time, over the scheduling, Cornette was told to \\"go home\\" if he disagreed. Calling Anderson's bluff, Cornette walked out of the room and told Lane he was leaving for good. Lane decided that he was going to quit as well, and after they bade goodbye to Eaton (who decided to stay due to his family obligations), both men left and began heading north toward North Carolina; it was not until Anderson came looking for Cornette and Lane later that he realized they had quit. So, for the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express. =New Midnight Express (1998)= The Midnight Express name was resurrected by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the late 1990s when they put a combination of Bob Holly (as \\"Bombastic Bob\\") and Bart Gunn (as \\"Bodacious Bart\\") together as \\"The New Midnight Express\\" with Cornette as their manager ‚Äî all as part of the \\"NWA invasion\\" angle. On March 30, 1998, they won the NWA World Tag Team Championship from The Headbangers, but did not achieve much more success in the WWF. Despite the name \\"Midnight Express\\" and having Cornette in their corner, wrestling fans consider this incarnation of the team as nothing more than a rib by Vince McMahon on Cornette, and in shoot interviews Cornette has indeed indicated that he never considered the team as continuing the lineage of the Midnight Express, since it was not his idea nor his intention to have \\"glorified jobbers\\" like Gunn and Holly take on the moniker (although Gunn and Holly were both former tag team champions prior to being teamed). =Midnight Express reunited (2004‚Äì2011)= In 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Rikki Nelson. This Midnight Express version was short-lived as Eaton soon started touring on select independent wrestling cards with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Lane and Cornette) as the Midnight Express instead. On June 7, 2008, they lost to The Rock 'n' Roll Express (Robert Gibson and Ricky Morton) at the NWA 60th Anniversary Show in Atlanta, Georgia. In August 2011, The Midnight Express wrestled their last match as a team against The Rock 'n' Roll Express at JCW's \\"Legends & Icons\\" show.

The majority of it was built as the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike in the early 19th century. It is the longest street in Boston, and it remains one of the longest streets in the state of Massachusetts.Jamaica Plain Historical Society Washington Street serves as a divide where a number of cross streets in Boston change name. History Washington Street, as it eventually became named, was the first road to connect the small peninsular town of Boston to the mainland, carrying the Boston Post Road to New York City. The name was first given to a section of this road in Boston from the border with Roxbury (which was then a separate town) to the fortification (near present-day East Berkeley Street), in honor of George Washington who rode through it during his tour of New England in October 1789. Washington Street was extended on July 6, 1824 to include the northward continuation of this road to Dock Square. This replaced other names that had been in use along this part of the road since 1706: * Orange Street, from the fortification to Essex Street/Boylston StreetVintage(early 1800s) map of Boston Neck, showing an \\"Orange Street\\" running SW to it from peninsular Boston of the 1770s * Newbury Street, from Essex Street/Boylston Street to Summer Street/Winter Street * Marlborough Street, from Summer Street/Winter Street to School Street * Cornhill, from School Street to Dock Square Then in Roxbury, the name Washington Street was given on May 9, 1825 to the southward continuation of this road (laid out in 1662) from the town line with Boston to the present-day Roxbury Street in Dudley Square. For a period of time afterwards, Washington Street extended westward from Dudley Square to the border with Brookline. Part of this extension (from present-day Columbus Avenue to the Brookline border) was renamed Tremont Street on July 2, 1860. Then the remaining part from Dudley Square was renamed Roxbury Street on June 16, 1874‚Äîand at the same time, Washington Street was extended southwestward from Dudley Square along the Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike to Rhode Island. The only location where Washington Street deviated from the path of the turnpike was south of downtown Dedham, bypassing what is now School Street and Court Street. In Boston, Washington Street was extended northward along a new road to Haymarket Square on November 6, 1872. (This extension would later be overtaken by the redevelopment of Haymarket Square and Scollay Square, which became Government Center.) Charlestown Street, which began in Haymarket Square (where Washington Street ended) and continued northward to the Charlestown Bridge, was renamed North Washington Street on March 1, 1901. The name of the bridge itself was changed to North Washington Street on February 10, 1910. The first state highway in Boston was the part of Washington Street from Dedham to West Roxbury Parkway (at Lagrange Street). It was taken over by the Massachusetts Department of Public Works in 1908.MassHighway state highway layout plan 1166 The short piece in West Roxbury Parkway, to just north of the road through the parkway, was taken over in 1921;MassHighway state highway layout plan 1915 (November 1, 1921) the next state highway in Boston was the Southern Artery in 1926.MassHighway state highway layout plan 2384 (November 3, 1926) =Norfolk and Bristol Turnpike= The turnpike was established in 1803 as a straighter alternative to two roads between Boston and Providence: the Lower Boston Post Road (via Norwood and Foxborough), and the road via Walpole and Wrentham. It ran from Dudley Square to the border of Rhode Island and beyond to downtown Pawtucket. The turnpike was constructed as an entirely new road, except for a part through North Attleborough (which is the only part bypassed today by US 1). The southern half of the turnpike, which had some steep grades and bypassed towns where travelers wanted to stop, saw little use and remained a dirt road until the construction of US 1. The part of the turnpike within the Roxbury limits was laid out as a public road in June 1857 and named Shawmut Avenue, as an extension of the existing Shawmut Avenue from Boston. The adjacent part of the turnpike within West Roxbury was named Shawmut Avenue as well on February 3, 1858. Extent and description the peninsula. The narrowest point was near today's crossing of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Washington Street begins at State and Court Streets as a one-way thoroughfare (for northbound traffic only). Through Downtown Crossing, from Milk Street south to Temple Place, Washington Street is closed to most vehicular traffic (and continues to be one-way northbound for authorized traffic only). South of Temple Place, Washington is, once again, one-way northbound, becoming two-way at Stuart Street and Kneeland Street. From Marginal Street, south to East Berkeley Street, including the bridge over the Massachusetts Turnpike and the adjacent Amtrak/Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) commuter rail tracks, the road is also one-way northbound, with a southbound contra-flowing bus lane for the Silver-Line bus. At Dudley Square in Roxbury, Washington Street is southbound-only for several blocks, between Warren Street and Dudley Street. Northbound traffic bypasses this section to the east using those two streets. Just after passing under the Arborway in Jamaica Plain, Washington Street becomes Hyde Park Avenue, and traffic staying on Washington Street must turn west on Ukraine Way to cross over the Amtrak/MBTA Commuter Rail tracks, and then south at South Street, which becomes Washington Street again. Southbound traffic must use short sections of South Street and Poplar Street at Roslindale Square. South of there, near the border between Roslindale and West Roxbury, Washington Street crosses West Roxbury Parkway and acquires a median strip. This median lasts until just before the Dedham city line, where the road continues as an undivided road. Washington Street continues southwestward, through the center of Dedham, the outskirts of Westwood, the centers of Norwood, and East Walpole and South Walpole. At the Walpole‚ÄìFoxborough line, it no longer crosses the railroad tracks (the old Mansfield and Framingham Railroad), and traffic must detour via Water Street and North Street. North Street connects to the Boston-Providence Turnpike, which carries US Route 1 (and was never actually a turnpike, a toll road). This road merges into the old path of Washington Street south of the railroad. From there to Rhode Island, except through North Attleborough center (which it bypasses using East Washington Street as opposed to North and South Washington Streets), US Route 1 stays with Washington, as it passes through the outskirts of Foxborough (past Gillette Stadium), Wrentham and Plainville, and then through South Attleboro. =Numbered routes= Washington Street currently has the following route numbers: * Route 1A from Elm Street in Dedham south to the split with Walpole Street in Norwood (except in northern Norwood, where 1A uses Upland Road) * US Route 1 from northern Foxborough near Gillette Stadium to Rhode Island, except through North Attleborough center, where US 1 uses East Washington Street When the first numbered highways in Massachusetts, the New England Interstate Highways, were assigned in 1922, NE 1 used Washington Street through North Attleborough center and from Norwood center to Arborway in Boston. By 1927, US 1 (as the road was now known) split in Dedham center onto Court Street, using Ames Street and Bridge Street into Boston, where it used Spring Street and Centre Street to reach Arborway. Soon after 1933, the new road (Boston-Providence Turnpike and Brook Farm Parkway) from Roslindale to Foxborough was finished, and it was around this time that the rest of the current alignment to Rhode Island was finished ‚Äî using Washington Street from Foxborough to the state line, except through North Attleborough center. The old road became Route 1A north from North Attleborough center and through South Attleboro, ending at the rotary just north of Dedham center. For several years in between, the new road was only built south of Dedham, and US 1 once again used Washington Street from Dedham into West Roxbury, where it cut north to Centre Street via West Roxbury Parkway. Between 1949 and 1961, 1A was truncated to end at US 1 via Elm Street south of Dedham center, probably to keep traffic out of Dedham center. US 1 was removed from that alignment in 1989, but 1A still ends at the old route. =Public transportation= As a main road, Washington Street has had its share of streetcar and later bus routes. It also had the Washington Street Elevated from south of downtown to and later . An 1871 map shows horsecar tracks from Boylston Street south to Dudley Street. An 1874 map extends them south from Dudley to just north of Forest Hills, and north to Dock Square. By 1888, tracks also used Washington north to Haymarket Square, and by 1897 all the way to and over the Charlestown Bridge. As the West End Street Railway electrified its lines in the late 19th century, Tremont Street was the first north-south arterial in downtown Boston to run electric streetcars. As the lines on Warren Street (December 28, 1889 ), Blue Hill Avenue (January 18, 1890 ), and Hampden Street (May 10, 1890 ) were electrified, they initially used Shawmut Avenue to reach Tremont Street. On September 2, 1890, the line on Washington Street to began electric operation, again using Shawmut Avenue north of Dudley Square. On November 28, 1891, the downtown Washington Street tracks were electrified, with the five Warren Street, Hampden Street, and Blue Hill Avenue routes rerouted to Washington Street. This relieved congestion on the Tremont Street tracks and allowed increases in service. A later, 1899 map, shows that tracks owned by the West Roxbury and Roslindale Street Railway continued southwest from Forest Hills via Dedham to Norwood. The Norfolk Southern Street Railway left Norfolk on the road to Walpole center, but used Washington Street from Common Street in Walpole to South Walpole. Except for the older section through North Attleborough center, used by the Interstate Consolidated Street Railway, none of the rest had streetcar tracks, due to its avoidance of populated areas. In 1925, yet another map still shows streetcar tracks on Washington Street within Boston, ending downtown at Essex Street. By 1953 they were only in use from Forest Hills to Egleston (by the 40 route, bus substituted December 18, 1955) and from Dudley to Northampton Street (by the 47 route, bustituted September 13, 1953, and the 10 route, bus substituted December 5, 1953). The Washington Street Elevated, later part of the Orange Line, opened from south of downtown Boston to Dudley on June 10, 1901, and south to Forest Hills November 22, 1909. The Washington Street Tunnel downtown opened November 30, 1908. The Elevated closed on April 30, 1987, with the opening of the Southwest Corridor several days later. Other Washington Streets in Boston There are two significant and two minor streets in Boston with the same name. Addresses at these streets need to be distinguished by neighborhood names or ZIP codes. * In the western part of Boston, Washington Street begins in Brookline Village, and crosses Brookline, Allston, Brighton, Newton, and Wellesley, ending at Wellesley's boundary with Natick, a total of almost .

As an example, the series 1 ‚Äì 1 + 1/2 ‚Äì 1/2 + 1/3 ‚Äì 1/3 + ... converges to 0 (for a sufficiently large number of terms, the partial sum gets arbitrarily near to 0); but replacing all terms with their absolute values gives 1 + 1 + 1/2 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/3 + ... , which sums to infinity. Thus the original series is conditionally convergent, and can be rearranged (by taking the first two positive terms followed by the first negative term, followed by the next two positive terms and then the next negative term, etc.) to give a series that converges to a different sum: 1 + 1/2 ‚Äì 1 + 1/3 + 1/4 ‚Äì 1/2 + ... = ln 2. More generally, using this procedure with p positives followed by q negatives gives the sum ln(p/q). Other rearrangements give other finite sums or do not converge to any sum. Definitions A series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n converges if there exists a value \\\\ell such that the sequence of the partial sums :(S_1, S_2, S_3, \\\\ldots), \\\\quad S_n = \\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k, converges to \\\\ell. That is, for any Œµ > 0, there exists an integer N such that if n ‚â• N, then :\\\\left\\\\vert S_n - \\\\ell \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\le \\\\epsilon. A series converges conditionally if the series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n converges but the series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\left\\\\vert a_n \\\\right\\\\vert diverges. A permutation is simply a bijection from the set of positive integers to itself. This means that if \\\\sigma is a permutation, then for any positive integer b, there exists exactly one positive integer a such that \\\\sigma (a) = b. In particular, if x e y, then \\\\sigma (x) e \\\\sigma (y). Statement of the theorem Suppose that (a_1, a_2, a_3, \\\\ldots) is a sequence of real numbers, and that \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n is conditionally convergent. Let M be a real number. Then there exists a permutation \\\\sigma such that :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_{\\\\sigma (n)} = M. There also exists a permutation \\\\sigma such that :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_{\\\\sigma (n)} = \\\\infty. The sum can also be rearranged to diverge to -\\\\infty or to fail to approach any limit, finite or infinite. Alternating harmonic series =Changing the sum= The alternating harmonic series is a classic example of a conditionally convergent series: :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} is convergent, while :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty \\\\bigg \\\\frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n} \\\\bigg is the ordinary harmonic series, which diverges. Although in standard presentation the alternating harmonic series converges to ln(2), its terms can be arranged to converge to any number, or even to diverge. One instance of this is as follows. Begin with the series written in the usual order, :1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\cdots and rearrange the terms: :1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{6} - \\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{1}{5} - \\\\frac{1}{10} - \\\\frac{1}{12} + \\\\cdots where the pattern is: the first two terms are 1 and ‚àí1/2, whose sum is 1/2. The next term is ‚àí1/4. The next two terms are 1/3 and ‚àí1/6, whose sum is 1/6. The next term is ‚àí1/8. The next two terms are 1/5 and ‚àí1/10, whose sum is 1/10. In general, the sum is composed of blocks of three: :\\\\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \\\\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \\\\frac{1}{4k},\\\\quad k = 1, 2, \\\\dots. This is indeed a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series: every odd integer occurs once positively, and the even integers occur once each, negatively (half of them as multiples of 4, the other half as twice odd integers). Since :\\\\frac{1}{2k - 1} - \\\\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} = \\\\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)}, this series can in fact be written: :\\\\frac{1}{2} - \\\\frac{1}{4} + \\\\frac{1}{6} - \\\\frac{1}{8} + \\\\frac{1}{10} + \\\\cdots + \\\\frac{1}{2(2k - 1)} - \\\\frac{1}{2(2k)} + \\\\cdots := \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{2} + \\\\frac{1}{3} - \\\\cdots\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(2) which is half the usual sum. =Getting an arbitrary sum= An efficient way to recover and generalize the result of the previous section is to use the fact that :1 + {1 \\\\over 2} + {1 \\\\over 3} + \\\\cdots + {1 \\\\over n} = \\\\gamma + \\\\ln n + o(1), where Œ≥ is the Euler‚ÄìMascheroni constant, and where the notation o(1) denotes a quantity that depends upon the current variable (here, the variable is n) in such a way that this quantity goes to 0 when the variable tends to infinity. It follows that the sum of q even terms satisfies :{1 \\\\over 2} + {1 \\\\over 4} + {1 \\\\over 6} + \\\\cdots + {1 \\\\over 2 q} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\, \\\\gamma + {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln q + o(1), and by taking the difference, one sees that the sum of p odd terms satisfies :{1} + {1 \\\\over 3} + {1 \\\\over 5} + \\\\cdots + {1 \\\\over 2 p - 1} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\, \\\\gamma + {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln p + \\\\ln 2 + o(1). Suppose that two positive integers a and b are given, and that a rearrangement of the alternating harmonic series is formed by taking, in order, a positive terms from the alternating harmonic series, followed by b negative terms, and repeating this pattern at infinity (the alternating series itself corresponds to , the example in the preceding section corresponds to a = 1, b = 2): :{1} + {1 \\\\over 3} + \\\\cdots + {1 \\\\over 2 a - 1} - {1 \\\\over 2} - {1 \\\\over 4} - \\\\cdots - {1 \\\\over 2 b} + {1 \\\\over 2 a + 1} + \\\\cdots + {1 \\\\over 4 a - 1} - {1 \\\\over 2b + 2} - \\\\cdots Then the partial sum of order (a+b)n of this rearranged series contains positive odd terms and negative even terms, hence :S_{(a+b)n} = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln p + \\\\ln 2 - {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln q + o(1) = {1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln(a/b) + \\\\ln 2 + o(1). It follows that the sum of this rearranged series is :{1 \\\\over 2} \\\\ln(a/b) + \\\\ln 2 = \\\\ln\\\\bigl( 2 \\\\sqrt{a/b} \\\\bigr). Suppose now that, more generally, a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series is organized in such a way that the ratio between the number of positive and negative terms in the partial sum of order n tends to a positive limit r. Then, the sum of such a rearrangement will be :\\\\ln\\\\bigl( 2 \\\\sqrt{r} \\\\bigr), and this explains that any real number x can be obtained as sum of a rearranged series of the alternating harmonic series: it suffices to form a rearrangement for which the limit r is equal . Proof =Existence of a rearrangement that sums to any positive real M= For simplicity, this proof assumes first that an ‚â† 0 for every n. The general case requires a simple modification, given below. Recall that a conditionally convergent series of real terms has both infinitely many negative terms and infinitely many positive terms. First, define two quantities, a_n^+ and a_n^- by: :a_{n}^{+} = \\\\frac{a_n + a_n}{2}, \\\\quad a_{n}^{-} = \\\\frac{a_n - a_n}{2}. That is, the series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n^{+} includes all an positive, with all negative terms replaced by zeroes, and the series \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n^{-} includes all an negative, with all positive terms replaced by zeroes. Since \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_n is conditionally convergent, both the positive and the negative series diverge. Let M be a positive real number. Take, in order, just enough positive terms a_{n}^{+} so that their sum exceeds M. Suppose we require p terms - then the following statement is true: :\\\\sum_{n=1}^{p-1} a_{n}^{+} \\\\leq M < \\\\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+}. This is possible for any M > 0 because the partial sums of a_{n}^{+} tend to +\\\\infty. Discarding the zero terms one may write :\\\\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} = a_{\\\\sigma(1)} + \\\\cdots + a_{\\\\sigma(m_1)}, \\\\quad a_{\\\\sigma(j)} > 0, \\\\ \\\\ \\\\sigma(1) < \\\\ldots < \\\\sigma(m_1) = p. Now we add just enough negative terms a_{n}^{-}, say q of them, so that the resulting sum is less than M. This is always possible because the partial sums of a_{n}^{-} tend to -\\\\infty. Now we have: :\\\\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{q} a_{n}^{-} < M \\\\leq \\\\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{q - 1} a_{n}^{-}. Again, one may write :\\\\sum_{n=1}^{p} a_{n}^{+} + \\\\sum_{n=1}^{q} a_{n}^{-} = a_{\\\\sigma(1)} + \\\\cdots + a_{\\\\sigma(m_1)} + a_{\\\\sigma(m_1+1)} + \\\\cdots + a_{\\\\sigma(n_1)}, with : \\\\sigma(m_1+1) < \\\\ldots < \\\\sigma(n_1) = q. The map œÉ is injective, and 1 belongs to the range of œÉ, either as image of 1 (if a1 > 0), or as image of (if a1 < 0). Now repeat the process of adding just enough positive terms to exceed M, starting with , and then adding just enough negative terms to be less than M, starting with . Extend œÉ in an injective manner, in order to cover all terms selected so far, and observe that must have been selected now or before, thus 2 belongs to the range of this extension. The process will have infinitely many such \\"changes of direction\\". One eventually obtains a rearrangement . After the first change of direction, each partial sum of differs from M by at most the absolute value a_{p_j}^{+} or a_{q_j}^{-} of the term that appeared at the latest change of direction. But converges, so as n tends to infinity, each of an, a_{p_j}^{+} and a_{q_j}^{-} go to 0\\\\. Thus, the partial sums of tend to M, so the following is true: :\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty a_{\\\\sigma(n)} = M. The same method can be used to show convergence to M negative or zero. One can now give a formal inductive definition of the rearrangement œÉ, that works in general. For every integer k ‚â• 0, a finite set Ak of integers and a real number Sk are defined. For every k > 0, the induction defines the value œÉ(k), the set Ak consists of the values œÉ(j) for j ‚â§ k and Sk is the partial sum of the rearranged series. The definition is as follows: * For k = 0, the induction starts with A0 empty and S0 = 0. * For every k ‚â• 0, there are two cases: if Sk ‚â§ M, then œÉ(k+1) is the smallest integer n ‚â• 1 such that n is not in Ak and an ‚â• 0; if Sk > M, then œÉ(k+1) is the smallest integer n ‚â• 1 such that n is not in Ak and an < 0\\\\. In both cases one sets :A_{k+1} = A_k \\\\cup \\\\\\\\{\\\\sigma(k+1)\\\\\\\\} \\\\, ; \\\\quad S_{k+1} = S_k + a_{\\\\sigma(k+1)}. It can be proved, using the reasonings above, that œÉ is a permutation of the integers and that the permuted series converges to the given real number M. =Existence of a rearrangement that diverges to infinity= Let \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty a_i be a conditionally convergent series. The following is a proof that there exists a rearrangement of this series that tends to \\\\infty (a similar argument can be used to show that -\\\\infty can also be attained). Let p_1 < p_2 < p_3 < \\\\cdots be the sequence of indexes such that each a_{p_i} is positive, and define n_1 < n_2 < n_3 < \\\\cdots to be the indexes such that each a_{n_i} is negative (again assuming that a_i is never 0). Each natural number will appear in exactly one of the sequences (p_i) and (n_i). Let b_1 be the smallest natural number such that :\\\\sum_{i=1}^{b_1} a_{p_i} \\\\geq a_{n_1} + 1. Such a value must exist since (a_{p_i}), the subsequence of positive terms of (a_i), diverges. Similarly, let b_2 be the smallest natural number such that: :\\\\sum_{i=b_1+1}^{b_2} a_{p_i} \\\\geq a_{n_2} + 1, and so on. This leads to the permutation :(\\\\sigma(1),\\\\sigma(2),\\\\sigma(3),\\\\ldots) = (p_1, p_2, \\\\ldots, p_{b_1}, n_1, p_{b_1+1}, p_{b_1+2}, \\\\ldots, p_{b_2}, n_2, \\\\ldots). And the rearranged series, \\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty a_{\\\\sigma(i)}, then diverges to \\\\infty. From the way the b_i were chosen, it follows that the sum of the first b_1+1 terms of the rearranged series is at least 1 and that no partial sum in this group is less than 0. Likewise, the sum of the next b_2 - b_1 + 1 terms is also at least 1, and no partial sum in this group is less than 0 either. Continuing, this suffices to prove that this rearranged sum does indeed tend to \\\\infty. = Existence of a rearrangement that fails to approach any limit, finite or infinite = In fact, if {\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum _{n=1}^{\\\\infty }a_{n}} is conditionally convergent, then there is a rearrangement of it such that the partial sums of the rearranged series form a dense subset of \\\\Reals.  Generalizations  = Sierpi≈Ñski theorem = In Riemann's theorem, the permutation used for rearranging a conditionally convergent series to obtain a given value in \\\\mathbf{R}\\\\cup\\\\\\\\{\\\\infty,-\\\\infty\\\\\\\\} may have arbitrarily many non-fixed points, i.e. all the indexes of the terms of the series may be rearranged. One may ask if it is possible to rearrange only the indexes in a smaller set so that a conditionally convergent series converges to an arbitrarily chosen real number or diverges to (positive or negative) infinity. The answer of this question is positive: Sierpi≈Ñski proved that is sufficient to rearrange only some strictly positive terms or only some strictly negative terms. This question has also been explored using the notion of ideals: for instance, Wilczy≈Ñski proved that is sufficient to rearrange only the indexes in the ideal of sets of asymptotic density zero. Filip√≥w and Szuca proved that other ideals also have this property. = Steinitz's theorem = Given a converging series of complex numbers, several cases can occur when considering the set of possible sums for all series obtained by rearranging (permuting) the terms of that series: * the series may converge unconditionally; then, all rearranged series converge, and have the same sum: the set of sums of the rearranged series reduces to one point; * the series may fail to converge unconditionally; if S denotes the set of sums of those rearranged series that converge, then, either the set S is a line L in the complex plane C, of the form ::L = \\\\\\\\{a + t b : t \\\\in \\\\mathbf{R} \\\\\\\\}, \\\\quad a, b \\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}, \\\\ b e 0, :or the set S is the whole complex plane C. More generally, given a converging series of vectors in a finite-dimensional real vector space E, the set of sums of converging rearranged series is an affine subspace of E.

Only two were made. Although preceded by Enzo Ferrari's Auto Avio Costruzioni 815 of 1940, the 125 S was the first vehicle to bear the Ferrari name when it debuted on May 11, 1947 at the Piacenza racing circuit. Like the 815, but unlike its inline-8 predecessor, partly developed from Fiat engine components, the 125 S featured a Ferrari designed and built engine; the Colombo V12 (the \\"125\\"), a trait it shared with most Ferrari cars of the following decades. The 125 S was replaced by the 159 S later in 1947. Overview =Chassis= The 125 S used a steel tube-frame chassis and had a double wishbone suspension with transverse leaf springs in front with a live axle in the rear. Hydraulic power drum brakes were specified front and rear. =Engine= The 125 S was powered by Gioacchino Colombo's 1.5 L (1497 cc/91 in¬≥) 60¬∞ V12 with a bore/stroke of 55 x 52.5 mm . This engine produced 118 bhp (87 kW) at 6,800 rpm with a compression ratio of 9.5:1. It was a single overhead camshaft design with 2 valves per cylinder and three double-choke Weber 30DCF carburettors. =Transmission= A five-speed transmission was used in the 125 S as it was better able to exploit the power curves of the high revving V-12 better than a traditional four-speed gearbox. Examples Both of the 125 S cars built in 1947 were dismantled, and their parts are thought to have been re-used in production of the 159 or 166 models. =Chassis 010I= Recently, the chassis with serial number 010I was used in the restoration of a 125 S. It is rumored that 010I is actually s/n 01C. The story goes that 01C was re-stamped as 010I, and sold to a customer as a new car. Upon taking receipt of the car, the new owner immediately exclaimed, muletto!, which means \\"Test mule\\" in Italian, as he could clearly see that his supposedly new car was in fact a used, well- raced car. Ferrari made a new invoice for the car, including a considerable rebate given the car's second-hand nature. Still in 166 Spyder Corsa configuration, the car was recently sold to Symbolic Motors. Close inspection of the chassis and its serial number led to the discovery of an old stamping that could possibly read 01C. It had been covered by an aluminum plate which bore the serial number 010I. Subsequently, the car was sold to its current owner, who refitted the chassis with a body similar to the factory's 125 S replica, which was built by Michelotto in 1987. The alleged 01C made its public debut at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, and was entered as a \\"Ferrari 125 S\\". The car continues to be the subject of much debate among Ferrari historians and enthusiasts; recent developments indicate that the restamped serial number was in fact a correction and not an alteration. Racing The 125 S debuted at the Circuito di Piacenza, driven by Franco Cortese, but was unable to finish the race, despite a favorable showing against the strong Maserati 6CS 1500s. Two weeks later, the 125 S claimed Ferrari's first victory at the Grand Prix of Rome on the Terme di Caracalla Circuit, where it was also driven by Cortese. The car had spun a bearing in practice, and was repaired in the shop of Tino Martinoli, who later came to America with the Ferrari Indy car team. The 125 S won six of its fourteen races in 1947, though drivers Clemente Biondetti and Giuseppe Navone were unable to win the 1947 Mille Miglia in it.

It is the first book in the Heritage of Shannara series, which takes place three hundred years after the end of the previous Shannara trilogy. The first version was published in 1990. The book follows the lives of the Scions of Shannara, Par Ohmsford, Walker Boh, and Wren (Ohmsford). Plot summary The Scions of Shannara is set in a land ruled by the cruel military order called the Federation. The Elves have vanished, while the dwarves are imprisoned for having fought the Federation in the past. The Dwarves are sent to dig in mines, and will soon be extinct because of the Federation's wickedness. Magic is forbidden. Par Ohmsford and his brother Coll start the story in Varfleet, telling legends and important histories of the past about the adventures of the Ohmsfords and the druids in a tavern through the use of Par's magic, the wishsong. The wishsong is but an illusion seen when Par sings what he wants to create. However, what Par and Coll are doing is illegal under the law of the Federation because magic is supposedly the cause for various problems that are occurring in the Four Lands. On one night, Rimmer Dall, first Seeker for the Federation, bursts into the tavern, having found out about Par and Coll, and tries to arrest them. Par and Coll are rescued by a mysterious man, who claims to be a leader of the rebel group (or the Movement). The man does not give them his name, though he does hand Par a ring with a hawk insignia. He tells them that when they need help they can go to a certain forge, show the ring, and they will be led to the Movement's base. Thus, the two brothers escape and after much debate decide to travel to Leah to meet up with their friend, Morgan Leah. Upon their way, they are attacked by a frightening woods hag who is a Shadowen, a beast of legend and of great power. Yet they are saved by an old man, Cogline, who was once a Druid, and is now a messenger for the Shade of Allanon. He informs them that they must travel to the Hadeshorn in order to meet with the ancient Druid, Allanon. The fate of the Four Lands lies upon them and the other scions of Shannara: Wren in the Westland and Walker Boh who lives somewhere in the Eastland, and to whom Cogline is to deliver the message also. The Shadowen threaten to overcome all the Races. The two brothers, and later Walker Boh and Wren, travel to the Hadeshorn through much peril. All the scions meet at the Valley of Shale and receive tasks from the shade of Allanon. Wren is charged to return the missing Elves, Walker is charged with returning Paranor and the Druids, and Par is charged with finding the lost Sword of Shannara. Both Wren and Walker see their charges as impossible (Walker even goes as far to say that he would rather lose his hand than recover lost Paranor and restore the druid order) and leave, but Par is determined to fulfill his task. Par heads to the forge, hoping that the Movement will know more of the Four Land in order to find the Sword. He comes to the city of Varfleet with his companions, Morgan Leah, Coll Ohmsford, Steff, and Teel to request for help from an outlaw ally. Upon reaching their meeting point, however, they are pursued by Federation. Hirehone, one of the outlaws, hides them in an underground basement before taking them to the Parma Key, base of the Movement. The company meets the mysterious leader who then tells them that he is Padishar Creel. He says he knows where the Sword is, leaving the Dwarves behind, Creel, Morgan, Coll, a group of outlaws, and Par set out for Tyrsis, the last known place of the Sword of Shannara. Once in Tyrsis, Creel leads them to a hiding place. Padishar Creel goes out to show Par about the truth. They meet with a girl, Damson Rhee. The three of them go for a walk and Creel explains that the Bridge of Sendric and People's Park in Tyrsis where the Sword was said to be placed many years before were destroyed. The ancient Bridge and Park were covered up in the Pit, a place guarded and unseen, and that fake ones were built in their place. They devise a plan so that Morgan, Par, Coll, Padishar, and some of the other outlaws venture into the Pit, where the Sword of Shannara was last seen. Then at night, the group go into out to the pit. They lower a ladder into the Pit, but unfortunately the Federation guards see them. The rebels and Par, Coll, and Morgan are captured and are told that one of the outlaws had betrayed them. Par uses the Wishsong to distract the guards so he could escape. He meets with Damson, and together they make a plan to free their companions. They do just that, and after hiding in another place, they make a plan to go into the Pit again. The second time the company, excluding Damson, makes it to the bottom of the Pit safely. There Par finds out that he can use another kind of magic that can find things that he wants, and he sees through this that the Sword is indeed there. However, they are confronted by Shadowen. Creel and Morgan make a stand in order for Par and Coll to escape. Par and Coll flee and are hidden by Damson, thinking that their friends are dead. Par insists on them to venture into the Pit a last time, and Damson knows a creature that might know another way into it. She leads them to the Mole, who agrees to help them, and escorts them through a series of tunnels and into the Pit. Damson and the Mole stay outside, while Par and Coll go in. This time Par does find the Vault, where the Sword is placed, and goes in, leaving Coll to stand guard outside (Coll wanted to). Par finds the Sword, and meets Rimmer Dall there, who shows him that he is a Shadowen and asks Par to join him. Par does not agree, and Rimmer Dall leaves, saying that once Par comes out of the Vault something precious will be lost. Par takes the Sword and runs out of the Vault to find that while he was gone Coll was possessed by Shadowen and that his brother has become one himself. Par kills him to escape and runs away from the Pit. He finds Damson and they hide in the tunnels that The Mole live in. Par, depressed and confused, becomes sick and Damson slowly but surely nurtures him back to health before vowing to get revenge for what happened to his brother. Meanwhile, Padishar and Morgan are actually not dead, and have fled from the city of Tyrsis, having survived using Morgan's magical Sword of Leah. But the Sword of Leah is broken in the act of breaking free from the Pit and Morgan turns ill because of this. The two of them run to Parma Key, and are closely pursued by an army of the Federation who want to put an end to the Movement once and for all, having found out the base of the rebels from a traitor. The companions come to Parma Key and prepare to battle away the Federation with the Movement. A long battle takes place, in which Morgan finds out who the traitor is - it being Teel the Dwarf, who is now a Shadowen, who is on her way to opening a passageway into Parma Key for the Federation to breach. Creel and Morgan fight her, and both are wounded in the act, while Steff, her lover, is killed by Teel. However, the passageway was opened, since they were too late, and so Morgan and Creel head back. The Movement then escapes using another secret tunnel and are free for the time. The battle ends thus, with the escape of the Movement. Walker Boh believes it is impossible for him to recover lost Paranor and the Druids, until Cogline brings him an old Druid History. Then Walker learns that he must first find the Black Elfstone from the Hall of Kings and with it accomplish his task. He goes to the Hall of Kings, which is an ancient place of great evil. There he goes and upon coming there goes to the location of the Black Elfstone. Using the magic he had mastered, he senses where the black elfstone is. He goes to where he feels something and there he encounters an Asphinx, a snake that turns everything it poisons to stone before becoming rock itself, instead of the black elfstone. The Asphinx bites him and Walker finds that his hand has turned to stone, effectively trapping him. Walker also knows that he is doomed because the poison of the Asphinx will spread until he has been completely turned to stone.

For MM it is used after at least one other treatment and generally together with dexamethasone. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, itchiness, joint pain, fever, headache, and trouble sleeping. Severe side effects may include low blood platelets, low white blood cells, and blood clots. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The dose may need to be adjusted in people with kidney problems. It has a chemical structure similar to thalidomide but has a different mechanism of action. How it works is not entirely clear as of 2019. Lenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses =Multiple myeloma= Lenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma. It is a more potent molecular analog of thalidomide, which inhibits tumor angiogenesis, tumor-secreted cytokines, and tumor proliferation through induction of apoptosis. Lenalidomide is effective at inducing a complete or \\"very good partial\\" response and improves progression-free survival. Adverse events more common in people receiving lenalidomide for myeloma include neutropenia, deep vein thrombosis, infections, and an increased risk of other hematological malignancies. The risk of second primary hematological malignancies does not outweigh the benefit of using lenalidomide in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. It may be more difficult to mobilize stem cells for autograft in people who have received lenalidomide. In 2006, lenalidomide received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for use in combination with dexamethasone in people with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy. In 2017, the FDA approved lenalidomide as standalone maintenance therapy (without dexamethasone) for people with multiple myeloma following autologous stem cell transplant. In 2009, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence issued a final appraisal determination approving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone as an option to treat people with multiple myeloma who have received two or more prior therapies in England and Wales. The use of lenalidomide combined with other drugs was evaluated. It was seen that the drug combinations of lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and continuous bortezomib plus lenalidomide plus dexamethasone probably result in an increase of the overall survival . =Myelodysplastic syndromes = Lenalidomide was approved by the FDA on 27 December 2005 for patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have chromosome 5q deletion syndrome (5q- syndrome) with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities. It was approved on 17 June 2013 by the European Medicines Agency for use in patients with low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes who have 5q- deletion syndrome but no other cytogenetic abnormalities and are dependent on red blood cell transfusions, for whom other treatment options have been found to be insufficient or inadequate. = Mantle cell lymphoma = Lenalidomide is approved by FDA as a specialty drug requiring a specialty pharmacy distribution for mantle cell lymphoma in patients whose disease has relapsed or progressed after at least two prior therapies, one of which must have included bortezomib. = Amyloidosis = Although not specifically approved by the FDA for use in treating amyloidosis, Lenalidomide is widely used in the treatment of that condition, often in combination with dexamethasone. Adverse effects In addition to embryo-fetal toxicity, lenalidomide carries black box warnings for hematologic toxicity (including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia) and thromboembolism. Serious potential side effects include thrombosis, pulmonary embolus, hepatotoxicity, and bone marrow toxicity resulting in neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Myelosuppression is the major dose-limiting toxicity, which is not the case with thalidomide. Lenalidomide may be associated with such adverse effects as second primary malignancy, severe cutaneous reactions, hypersensitivity reactions, tumor lysis syndrome, tumor flare reaction, hypothyroidism, and hyperthyroidism. =Teratogenicity= Lenalidomide is related to thalidomide, which is known to be teratogenic. Tests in monkeys suggest that lenalidomide is likewise teratogenic. It cannot be prescribed for women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant during therapy. For this reason, the drug is only available in the United States through a restricted distribution system in conjunction with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy. Females who may become pregnant must use at least two forms of reliable contraception during treatment and for at least four weeks after discontinuing treatment with lenalidomide. =Venous thromboembolism= Lenalidomide, like its parent compound thalidomide, may cause venous thromboembolism (VTE), a potentially serious complication with their use. High rates of VTE have been found in patients with multiple myeloma who received thalidomide or lenalidomide in conjunction with dexamethasone, melphalan, or doxorubicin. =Stevens-Johnson syndrome= In March 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) included lenalidomide on a list of twenty prescription drugs under investigation for potential safety problems. The drug was investigated for possibly increasing the risk of developing Stevens‚ÄìJohnson syndrome, a life-threatening skin condition. =FDA ongoing safety review= In 2011, the FDA initiated an ongoing review of clinical trials that found an increased risk of developing cancers such as acute myelogenous leukemia and B-cell lymphoma, though it did not advise patients to discontinue treatment with lenalidomide. Mechanism of action Lenalidomide has been used to successfully treat both inflammatory disorders and cancers in the past ten years. There are multiple mechanisms of action, and they can be simplified by organizing them as mechanisms of action in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, lenalidomide has three main activities: direct anti-tumor effect, inhibition of angiogenesis, and immunomodulation. In vivo, lenalidomide induces tumor cell apoptosis directly and indirectly by inhibition of bone marrow stromal cell support, by anti-angiogenic and anti-osteoclastogenic effects, and by immunomodulatory activity. Lenalidomide has a broad range of activities that can be exploited to treat many hematologic and solid cancers. On a molecular level, lenalidomide has been shown to interact with the ubiquitin E3 ligase cereblon and target this enzyme to degrade the Ikaros transcription factors IKZF1 and IKZF3. This mechanism was unexpected as it suggests that the major action of lenalidomide is to re-target the activity of an enzyme rather than block the activity of an enzyme or signaling process, and thereby represents a novel mode of drug action. A more specific implication of this mechanism is that the teratogenic and anti-neoplastic properties of lenalidomide, and perhaps other thalidomide derivatives, could be disassociated. History Lenalidomide was approved for medical use in the United States in 2005. = Society and culture = Economics Lenalidomide costs per year for the average person in the United States as of 2012. Lenalidomide made almost $9.7bn for Celgene in 2018. In 2013, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) rejected lenalidomide for \\"use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\\" in England and Scotland, arguing that Celgene \\"did not provide enough evidence to justify the per month () price-tag of lenalidomide for use in the treatment of people with a specific type of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)\\". Research Lenalidomide is undergoing clinical trial as a treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, as well as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and solid tumor cancers, such as carcinoma of the pancreas. One Phase III clinical trial being conducted by Celgene in elderly patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia was halted in July 2013, when a disproportionate number of cancer deaths were observed during treatment with lenalidomide versus patients treated with chlorambucil.

He served as a shepherd alongside his father in his childhood and adolescence, but desired to enter the religious life. He was refused once but later was admitted as a Franciscan lay brother and became noted for his strict austerities, as well as his love for and compassion towards the sick. He was sent to counter the arguments of the Calvinists in France but was chased out and nearly killed by a mob. He was best known for his strong and deep devotion to the Eucharist. His piety drew people from all over seeking his counsel, and at his death caused miracles that were reported at his tomb. The process for his canonization opened and in 1618 he was beatified; Pope Alexander VIII canonized him a saint on 16 October 1690. Early life Paschal Bayl√≥n was born on 16 May 1540 at Torrehermosa, in the Kingdom of Aragon, on the feast of the Pentecost to the poor but pious peasants Martin and Elizabeth Jubera Bayl√≥n. The fact that he was born on the feast of Pentecost led to his parents naming him \\"Pascual\\" (Paschal). He had at least two older siblings. He spent his childhood and adolescence as a shepherd, and as he toiled in the fields remained attentive to the sound of the church bell which rang during the Elevation during the Mass. Paschal was very honest, and once offered to reimburse the owners of crops damaged due to his animals getting loose. He carried a book with him into the fields where he watched the sheep, and ask those that he met to teach him the letters; and so, in a short time, being still quite young, he learned to read. Paschal in his poverty joined alms with his continual prayer; and not having any other means to relieve the poor, always gave them a good part of his own dinner which was sent him into the fields.Butler, Alban. \\"St. Pascal Baylon\\", The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, 1864, D. & J.

Friar Those to whom he first mentioned his inclination to a religious life, recommended several richly endowed monasteries, but he answered,\\"I was born poor and am resolved to die in poverty and penance\\". In 1564 he joined the Reformed Franciscans as a religious brother and commenced his period of novitiate on 2 February before making his profession on 2 February 1565 in Orito at the Saint Joseph convent. He was urged to become an ordained priest but he felt that was not the path for him. But he was once denied the chance to join on the account of his age prompting him to return to his duties as a shepherd before the order had a change of heart and admitted him into their ranks. He had never more than one habit, and that always threadbare. He walked without sandals in the snows, and in the roughest roads. He accommodated himself to all places and seasons, and was always content, cheerful, mild, affable, and full of respect for all. His jobs included serving as a cook and porter as well as the gardener and the official beggar who went around asking for alms. He lived this life in contemplation and silent meditation and often did this as he worked. He was a contemplative and had frequent ecstatic visions. He would spend the night before the altar in silence during some nights to commune with God and to meditate on the faith. But he also shrugged off those notions of him gaining a reputation coming from that pious nature. His superior sent him to France in 1576 to have him defend the Real Presence against the opinions of a Calvinist preacher. But he was despised there and was almost killed after a Huguenot mob chased him out. Those chasing him hurled stones and dirt at him causing him to break his shoulder and become bruised. The humble friar never wasted food. The end of each week saw him eat a few boiled vegetables which had been soaked in water with the terrible smelling weed known as wormwood. He often ate scraps from the kitchen. Other austerities included wearing a coat with steel spikes or a patched habit including one tunic lined with rough pig hair designed to cause discomfort. Sometimes he slept out in the cold. He died on 17 May after being taken ill; this day is also his feast day. Veneration Sepulchre in Villarreal His tomb in Villarreal became an immediate place of pilgrimage and there were soon miracles that were reported at his tomb. Pope Paul V beatified him on 29 October 1618 while Pope Alexander VIII canonized him later on 16 October 1690. In 1730 an indigenous Guatemalan claimed to have had a vision of a sainted Paschal appearing as a robed skeleton. This event became the basis of the heterodox tradition of San Pascualito. He was enlisted in the church's struggle against Modernism part of which was through increasing devotion towards the Eucharist; Pope Leo XIIIIn the Apostolic Brief Providentissimus Deus on 28 November 1897. proclaimed the saint as the \\"seraph of the Eucharist\\" as well as the patron of Eucharistic congresses and affiliated associations. Art often depicts him wearing the Franciscan habit and bearing a monstrance which signifies his devotion to the Holy Eucharist. Pope John XXIII named the saint as the patron for the Segorbe diocese on 12 May 1961. During the Red Terror at the time of the Spanish Civil War his grave was desecrated and anticlerical leftists had his relics burned though some remained. Those that did were later transferred in the presence of King Juan Carlos I on 12 May 1992.

Scranton under Emperor Gojong. It is the first founded university in South Korea. It is currently the world's largest female educational institute. Also, it is one of the prestigious universities in South Korea History Ewha Womans University traces its roots back to Mary F. Scranton's Ewha Haktang () mission school for girls, which opened with one student on May 31, 1886.Lee Jeong-kyu. (2001). The establishment of modern universities in Korea and their implications for Korean education policies. In Education Policy Analysis Archives 9 (27) The name Ewha, which means ‚ÄúPear Blossoms‚Äù, was bestowed by the Emperor Gojong the following year. The image of the pear blossom is incorporated in the school's logo. The school began providing college courses in 1910, and professional courses for women in 1925. The high school section, now known as Ewha Girls' High School (not to be confused with the coeducational Ewha Womans University High School, the university's demonstration school, founded in 1958), separated from the college section and is currently located in Jung-gu, Seoul. Both institutions share the same motto and the \\"pear blossoms\\" image in their logos. Immediately following liberation of Korea on August 15, 1945, the college received government permission to become a university. It was the first South Korean university to be officially organized. Student population According to figures provided by the university in April 2018, there are 21,596 enrolled students at the university. While figures on the student body's gender breakdown are not available, Korea JoongAng Daily reported in 2003 there were 10 male students enrolled at the time. In 2009, Asian Correspondent reported that male students make up 30% of all foreign international students at the university. Collaborations The university collaborates with around 830 partners in 64 countries including Australian National University, Cornell University, Freie University of Berlin, Ghent University, Harvard University, Indiana University, King‚Äôs College London, Nanyang Technological University, Peking University, University of Kuala Lumpur, University of California, Irvine, University of British Columbia, University of Edinburgh, University of Hong Kong, University of South Carolina, Uppsala University, Waseda University, and a direct exchange program with Mills College in Oakland, California. Name The university now explains its peculiar name by saying that while the lack of an apostrophe in \\"Womans University\\" is unconventional, the use of \\"Woman\\" rather than \\"Women\\" was normal in the past.Compare Texas Woman's University, named in 1957, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, named in 1893, as well as Mississippi Woman's College and Woman's College of the University of North Carolina, all of which have since changed their names. It claims the use of \\"Womans\\" carries special meaning in that the early founders of the college thought that every woman is to be respected; to promote this idea, they chose the word \\"woman\\" to avoid lumping students together under the word \\"women\\". The claim has not been substantiated.  Museum  Ewha Womans University Museum opened in April 1935. It has a wide range of artifacts, ranging from paintings, ceramics, crafts, doubles and folk items, and its main collection is the Korean National Treasure No. 107 white porcelain, iron and grape jars. The museum consists of a permanent exhibition hall, a planning exhibition hall, a donation exhibition hall and a Damin Goksik art museum.

She is known to have encouraged young men to enlist in the Japanese army. The statue of Helen Kim and the building named after her on campus has been criticized. Students have protested many times to take down the statue. While Ewha Womans University has been the center of women's rights movements that had positive impacts on Korean society, this feminist feature created controversies in Korea, where misogyny is deep- seated. One example of controversies was men's benefit from military service. Originally, getting extra points on employment and being paid for higher step in the salary class were available to males who had done their mandatory military service. Yet, in 1999, Ewha Womans University students and one male student, who was a disabled student at Yonsei University, protested that this was sexist and discriminatory toward disabled people. This case eventually went to court, and the court ruled that this was, indeed, sexism and discrimination toward the disabled. Ewha Womans University became embroiled in the 2016 South Korean political scandal, because a former student, Chung Yoo- ra, was admitted under a special rule change by virtue of her mother's close connections to South Korean President Park Geun-hye despite not meeting requirements. Students had already been protesting against some of the university's unilateral changes to the degree system and departments before the political scandal blew up. As a result, the university's president, Choi Kyunghee, was ousted and convicted and Chung Yoo-ra's degree was rescinded.

He is the singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter of the Berkeley, California punk rock band The Mr. T Experience, and has remained the only consistent member of the band since its formation in 1985, performing on ten studio albums and five EPs. He has also recorded and performed as a solo artist, releasing the album Show Business is My Life in 1999 and the EP Eight Little Songs in 2003. In recent years he has pursued a writing career in young adult literature, authoring the novels King Dork (2006), Andromeda Klein (2009), and King Dork Approximately (2014). Education Portman attended Mills High School in Millbrae, California in the San Francisco Bay Area. He then moved to nearby Berkeley and attended the University of California, Berkeley. Musical career Portman's musical career began during his high school years in 1979, when he played in a band called the Bent Nails alongside future Mr. T Experience bass player Byron Stamatatos. The group was short-lived but released a song entitled \\"No More Riots\\" on the northern California punk compilation Not So Quiet on the Western Front released by Maximum Rocknroll in 1982. After high school Portman left Millbrae for UC Berkeley but kept in touch with Stamatatos. While a student there he hosted a program on campus radio station KALX which prominently featured local punk rock music, and met fellow DJ Jon Von Zelowitz. While working at the station Portman recorded a rap version of the Dr. Seuss children's poem Green Eggs and Ham. He also met Alex Laipeneiks, who had been a high school friend of Portman's younger brother John Portman. In the Summer of 1985 Portman, Zelowitz, Stamatatos, and Laipeneiks formed The Mr. T Experience. It was at this time that Portman began using the stage name \\"Dr. Frank,\\" which he continues to use in his musical endeavors to this day. The Mr. T Experience recorded their first album Everybody's Entitled to Their Own Opinion in July 1986. They began to build a local following through tours and airplay on college radio stations and quickly became part of the thriving late-1980s Bay Area punk rock movement centered around the 924 Gilman Street venue and the Lookout! Records label. At this time Portman briefly also played drums with the band Sweet Baby, but quickly returned to his main focus The Mr. T Experience, who released their second album Night Shift at the Thrill Factory in 1988. Included on the album was the song \\"The History of the Concept of the Soul,\\" which was essentially Portman's college thesis condensed into an 80-second punk song. In 1990 the band signed to Lookout! Records, a label they remain on to this day and through which Portman has also released all of his other musical output. Portman continues to be the guitarist and vocalist for The Mr. T Experience, also acting as the band's primary songwriter. Zelowitz also contributed significantly to the band's songwriting and served as a second guitarist and occasional singer until his departure from the group in 1992, after which the band essentially became Portman's project. Despite multiple lineup changes over the years, he remains the band's sole songwriter and only remaining original member. The band has released ten full-length albums, several EPs, and numerous singles over the course of their career, with nearly all material written and sung by Portman. After some solo acoustic performances he recorded a solo album entitled Show Business is My Life in 1999 and an EP, Eight Little Songs, in 2003. Many of the songs from this EP were re-recorded with The Mr. T Experience for the 2004 album Yesterday Rules, their most recent and stylistically diverse release. Portman continues to perform occasionally as a solo artist. He also occasionally plays in The Bomb Bassets with his longtime friend Dallas Denery. Portman's musical style is generally characterized as pop punk, heavily influenced by the Ramones and other melodic rock groups. This is the style most generally associated with The Mr. T Experience. His compositions cover a variety of topics but are concerned primarily with personal relationships; he is known to introduce much of his material with the throwaway line \\"This is a song about a girl.\\" Over the years his other musical tastes and interests have pushed the band to explore many styles, branching out from the Bay Area pop punk sound which he helped define. This change is evidenced on a number of solo acoustic songs interspersed between the pop punk standards on most of the band's late-1990s albums. Portman's solo recordings have further explored these other styles and influences, including country, bossa nova, Rock & Roll, and 1960s beat music. Writing career In recent years Portman has published a blog entitled \\"Dr. Frank's What's-It.\\" His young adult novel King Dork was published in April 2006. The film rights to the book were optioned by Gary Sanchez Productions that November. In May 2009 Portman reported that a new deal had been reached with Sony Pictures and that a director had been attached to the film. The Internet Movie Database lists the film as \\"in development\\". Portman's second novel, Andromeda Klein, was published on August 25, 2009. A King Dork sequel entitled King Dork Approximately was published in 2014.

ITSPs are also known as voice service providers (VSP). History In the United States, net2Phone began offering consumer VoIP service in 1995. Usually, ITSPs negotiate agreements for route termination to various parts of the world from multiple VoIP providers. ITSP customers may be able to choose a VoIP provider for their VoIP calls. Customers may be able to do this by specifying the maximum price they are willing to pay per minute for a call and the lowest quality they are willing to tolerate. The ITSP routing software searches for the wholesale VoIP providers who meet the customer specification and attempt to route the customer call to the providers starting with the one have the lowest quoted price. Pricing to different parts of the world depend on several factors, such as the routing via a white route or a black route, wholesaler's margin, and the country's regulations.

He brings awareness to 'Hindu Holocaust' in medieval times and advocates for an Indigenous Aryan narrative. He is also the founder of a private museum which seeks to portray Indian history in a nationalist manner. Gautier has written books on the history and indology; he has established NGO namely Foundation for Advancement of Cultural Ties. Life = Early life = Francois Gautier was born in 1950 in Paris and received an upper-class Catholic education. He was subsequently sent to reputed boarding schools across Europe, from where he was expelled several times. Gautier said that he \\"never really fitted in the system\\". He attended the IDRAC business school in Paris before dropping out to work in a small newspaper. Gautier came to India at the age of 19 in 1969, as part of a trans-world journey, along with the first wave of Auroville- migrants. He was accompanied by the son of Charles Fran√ßois Marie Baron, Pondicherry's last French governor. Deeply impressed with Sri Aurobindo's writings, he chose to reside over Sri Aurobindo Ashram where his encounters with Mirra Alfassa influenced him to further prolong his stay. Gautier went on to stay over there for about seven years. Personal life Fran√ßois Gautier is married to Namrita Bindra Gautier, whose mother was a Hindu and father a Sikh. Gautier primarily resides in Auroville in India, and visits his family in France annually. Career =Journalism= After arriving in India, Gautier stopped writing for many years and focused on other activities. In 1982, he found an article in a French newspaper, that supposedly contained clich√©s about the Indian socio-polity. He wrote a letter to the editor suggesting corrections, wherein he was offered to write an article. He wrote several more articles for the newspaper and went on to work as a writer and photographer for other publications. He served as the South-Asia correspondent of Journal de Geneve, a Geneva-based newspaper before switching to the same post at Le Figaro in 1993. He stayed over there for about 8 years before shifting to Ouest-France and then, La Cha√Æne Info. Gautier used to write a regular column for Rediff.com. Gautier has also written columns for The New Indian Express, DNA India, Outlook India, and others. He is also the editor of La Revue de l'Inde. =Writing= Gautier became interested in Indology when he began to travel outside Auroville. Sita Ram Goel contacted Gautier after reading some of his articles in a magazine called Blitz and asked for permission to reprint the articles in his book. Gautier instead wrote the book The Wonder That Is India. Later, the website Hinduism Today republished it online. Following this, Gautier wrote several other books. Gautier has worked on a book about the martial art Kalaripayattu of South India with photographer Raghu Rai. In 2010, an anonymously authored novel titled Hindutva, Sex and Adventure was published that featured a foreign radio journalist who came to India and became a Hindutva supporter‚Äîit was considered to be a satire of BBC reporter Mark Tully. It was speculated that Gautier may have been the author, but he denied the allegation. =Photography and painting exhibitions= Gautier has established the Foundation for Advancement of Cultural Ties (FACT), a NGO dedicated to portraying Indian history in a \\"correct\\" manner. It has organised multiple painting exhibitions across the country to depict and highlight how a range of events from the insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir to the cruelties of Mughal emperors has affected the life of Hindus. He eventually planned to establish a museum similar to those for the Jew cause. Gautier also planned to tour the world with his museums and aware the foreign community about the systemic extermination of Hindus. The exhibitions have received mixed response and the underlying motives have been questioned. In 2012, the Shivaji Maharaj Museum of Indian History was established by FACT. In 2013, during the visit of the 14th Dalai Lama, Gautier and his wife, organised an exhibition on the origin of Buddhism in India and its spread to Tibet with the help of materials from the Tibet Museum of Dharamsala, to educate the local people about Tibetan culture. Views and opinions Gautier, who is critical of the partition of India, has advocated for Indian reunification, stating \\"as long as Pakistan and India are divided there will be other Kashmirs, other Ayodhyas, other wars with Pakistan‚Äînuclear maybe‚Äîand India will never be at peace with its own Muslim community, which is a permanent danger to herself.\\" Gautier contends that India, through the exercise and spread of Sanatan dharma shall strive to be a global superpower but prior to that shall decentralize the economy and Indianize its social, political and educational systems, even at the cost of democratic principles and the constitution. In abidance with a Hinducentric scholarship, he has criticized the narrative of Indian historiography to be leftist, which have apparently glorified foreign invaders at the cost of the Hindu empires, and thus urges for a complete revisionism. A front-line Hindutva activist, Gautier also deems Hinduism to be under threat from Islam, Christian missionaries, Marxism and westernisation, HE (thus) calls for use-of-force by the oppressed Hindus and opines of the Buddhist-Jain philosophies of Ahimsa to have actually enabled exploitation of India by foreign invaders. One of his most prominent views is about the existence of a Hindu Holocaust, perpetrated by Islamic invaders which (supposedly) exceeded the extents of the Jew Holocaust and all other genocides. Gautier has also rejected the western-oriental scholarship of Max M√ºller, Arthur Llewellyn Basham as ill-portrayals of the history of the nation which birthed the theory of Hindu imperialism. Gautier accepts the Indigenous Aryan hypothesis in favor of the Indo-Aryan migration theory and supports the idea of Jesus Christ having come to India, to be inspired by Hindu and Buddhist esoterism. He also considers Koenraad Elst as one of the most knowledgeable scholars on India and regretted of his' being unable to publish except from Hindu-oriented publishing houses. A staunch opponent of Nehruvian ideologies, he has critiqued Gandhi's policy towards Muslim separatists during the partition of India as Muslim-appeasement. Gautier have also attacked the existence and manifestation of caste privilege in the Indian society and derivatives thereof, instead arguing for a hypothesis wherein the socially and economically privileged and dis-privileged populaces are in a constant flux and which primarily manifests in reverse discrimination in the long run. He has criticized the United Progressive Alliance government (2009-2014) and claimed that terrorism continued unabated whilst Muslim mullahs were allowed to preach freely and Hindu gurus were being targeted by the media and police. He has earlier criticized the usage of the term \\"Godman\\" by Indian media to describe self-proclaimed Hindu gurus proposing that Indian journalists often were not proud of their culture and had called for imparting a more fairer treatment.  Reception  Manisha Basu, writing in The Rhetoric of Hindu India, deems him to be part of a suave derivative of Hindutva and notes of his consistent attacks upon left-liberal commentators‚Äîpeople who have supposedly leveraged their social privilege to dominate the socio-political consciousness of the \\"Anglophone national bourgeoisie\\" for long enough‚Äîin the process of becoming one of the few self-appointed interpreters of the Indian Right. Malini Parthasarathy too notes him to be a prominent voice of Hindutva, others have noted him as an ideologue as well. Basu remarks of his attacks against the constructs of Brahmanic privilege (and other intersectionalities) along with the radical perspectivising of proper historiography to be mere statistical extensions of first-hand-experiences have a high degree of similarity to Jay Dubashi's writings and his broader views about the journalistic model of history. Scholars have rejected his theories of a Hindu- Holocaust and have deemed him to be Islamophobic. He was subject to severe criticism after having objected to the proposed induction of Aamir Khan, a Muslim Bollywood actor over a planned dramatization of Mahabharata, a Hindu epic. He had earlier asked for the boycott of PK, a Bollywood film starring the same actor, due to its depiction of a Hindu-Muslim love affair and accused Ashoka University of teaching an anti-Hindu anti-Brahmin book. In 2017, Gautier claimed over a blog at The Times of India to have come across a hitherto-hidden manuscript of Nostradamus in a trunk, that (successfully) prophesied the statesmanship of Narendra Modi. The claims were reported across multiple news-outlets. Earlier he had asserted of Nostradamus to have established the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, an Indian Hindu nationalist organisation. Other claims included that Nostradamus had successfully prophesied the chances of a possible nuclear war between India and Pakistan, the construction of Ram Mandir and the Hindu domination of world affairs after 2014. He later said in an interview that this had been a \\"spoof\\", but it was taken in earnest by some commentators who accused him of having tampered with the original passages for fulfilling his political agenda. At one case, he used the same passage over his blogs across the course of a few years but changed the name of the subjects to keep up with the political currents. Gautier has been documented to have propagated fake news over other occasions.

He had a career as a university professor, and civil engineer. The structure known as the Vierendeel truss is named after him. Biography He obtained an MSc in construction and mining engineering in 1874 at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain, after which he worked as an engineer for the company Nicaise et Delcuve in La Louvi√®re, Belgium. In 1885 he became Director for the Ministry of Public Works in West Flanders, and four years afterward also achieved the post of Professor of Construction, Material Strength, and Structural Engineering at the Universit√© catholique de Louvain. The idea of a bridge without trusses came to him in 1895; the design later became known as a Vierendeel bridge. For the 1897 World Fair at Brussels he built a 31.5m span bridge at his own expense and loaded to show the correlation between measurement and his numerical analysis. His work, Cours de stabilit√© des constructions (1889) was an important reference during more than half a century. His first bridge was built in Avelgem in 1902, crossing the Scheldt river. The construction of this bridge became famous through the Stijn Streuvels book De Teloorgang van de Waterhoek. He retired as director of public works in West Flanders in 1927, and as Professor at Leuven Catholic University in 1936. He died in 1940. Legacy The Vierendeel truss was used in Belgium, particularly on the Belgian railways. Discussions in the journal Der Eisenbau concerning the pros and cons of the Vierendeel truss led to the development of deformational modelling of structures - necessary for mathematical analysis of Vierendeel trusses. He emphasised an importance of aesthetics over pure engineering: As of 2011 the 'castellated beam' and 'cellular beam' are in common use in construction for roof and floor support - both are open web structures without diagonal trusses; vierendeel truss type analysis is used to understand and predict failure modes, which include vierendeel truss type failures.

Life The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests that Brooke may have been a son of Thomaz Broke. Brooke was admitted to the Inner Temple, at the request of Gorboduc's authors, Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville. He may have written the masque that accompanied the play. On 19 March 1563, Brooke died in the shipwreck that also killed Sir Thomas Finch, bound for Le Havre, besieged in the French Wars of Religion. In 1567 George Turberville published a collection of poetry entitled, Epitaphs, Epigrams, Songs and Sonnets; it included An Epitaph on the Death of Master Arthur Brooke Drownde in Passing to New Haven. The Tragical History of Romeus and Juliet Though ostensibly a translation from the Italian of Bandello, Brooke's poem is derived from a French version by Pierre Boaistuau. The work was published by Richard Tottell. Bernard Garter published The Tragicall and True Historie which Happened betweene Two English Lovers (1565), which imitated Brooke's work in a ballad metre. A prose version of Romeo and Juliet (1567) was printed in The Palace of Pleasure, a collection of tales edited by William Painter. Shakespeare stuck quite closely to the version by Brooke.

He was one of the Navaratnas in Akbar's court.

Pages : 61-62. Vol. III in a Hindu family, considered by historians as either Agarwal, Khatri or Kayastha. Todar Mal's father died when he was very young leaving no means of livelihood for him. Todar Mal started his career from the humble position of a writer but slowly moved up the ranks when the Sher Shah Suri, committed him to the charge of building a new fort of Rohtas in Punjab with the objective of preventing Ghakkar raids and to also act as a barrier to the Mughals in the north-west. After the Sur dynasty was overthrown by the Mughals, Todar Mal continued in the service of the ruling power, which was now the Mughal Emperor Akbar. Under Akbar, he was placed in charge of Agra. Later, he was made governor of Gujarat. At various times, he also managed Akbar's Mint at Bengal and served in Punjab. Todar Mal's most significant contribution, which is appreciated even today, is that he overhauled the revenue system of Akbar's Mughal empire. Raja Todarmal built a fortress-palace at Laharpur in the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh. Beveridge records that Raja Todar Mal had got leave from Akbar and was on his way to Haridwar, but he received a letter from Akbar in which the latter is said to have written that \\"it was better to go on working and doing good to the world than to go on a pilgrimage.\\" Todar Mal also translated Bhagavata Purana into Persian. Following Todar Mal's death on 8 November 1589 in Lahore, his body was cremated according to the Hindu traditions. Raja Bhagwan Das, his colleague in the charge of Lahore, was present at the ceremony. Of his two sons, Dhari was killed in a battle in Sindh. Another son, Kalyan Das, was sent by Todar Mal to subdue the Raja of Kumaon in the Himalayas. He rose to become the Finance Minister in Akbar's Darbar. As a soldier Todar Mal is recognized as an able warrior, who led in various battles. As a Finance minister of Akbar Todar Mal succeeded Khwaja Malik I'timad Khan in 1560. Raja Todar Mal introduced standard weights and measures, a land survey and settlement system, revenue districts and officers. This system of maintenance by Patwari is still used in Indian Subcontinent which was improved by British Raj and Government of India. Raja Todar Mal, as finance minister of Akbar, introduced a new system of revenue known as zabt and a system of taxation called dahshala. He took a careful survey of crop yields and prices cultivated for a 10-year period 1570‚Äì1580. On this basis, tax was fixed on each crop in cash. Each province was divided into revenue circles with their own rates of revenue and a schedule of individual crops. This system was prevalent where the Mughal administration could survey the land and keep careful accounts. For the revenue system, Akbar's territory was divided into 15 Subahs, which were further subdivided into a total of 187 Sarkars across 15 subahs, and those 197 sarkars (sirkar) were further subdivided into a total of 3367 Mahals or Pargana. Several Mahals were grouped into Dasturs, a unit between Mahal and Sirkar. Portion of larger Mahal or Pargana was called taraf. Mahals was subdivided into standardised Bighas. A Bigha was made of 3600 Ilahi Gaj, which is roughly half of modern acre. Unit of measurement was standardised to Ilahi Gaj, which was equivalent to 41 fingers (29-32 inches). Lead measuring rope, called Tenab, was also standardised by joining pieces of Bamboo with iron rings so that the length of Tenab did not vary with seasonal changes.[Indian History, VK Agnihotri, pp.B249 ][The Challenges of Indian Management, B R Virmani pp.57] This system was not applicable in the provinces like Gujarat and Bengal. Death Todar Mal died in Lahore on 8 November 1589. Legacy The Kashi Vishwanath Temple was rebuilt in 1585 by Todar Mal.http://www.bhu.ac.in/Centre/temples.htm In popular culture In the historical serial, Bharat Ek Khoj, Todar Mal was played by popular character actor, Harish Patel in the two episodes (Episodes 32 and 33) on the life and times of Emperor Akbar. Todar Mal is featured in the video games Sid Meier's Civilization IV: Beyond the Sword, Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods and Kings, and most recently in Sid Meier's Civilization VI as a \\"great merchant\\".

BC-STV was supported by a majority (57.7 percentElections BC: Statement of Votes - Referendum on Electoral Reform - May 17, 2005, page 9) of the voters in a referendum held in 2005 but the government had legislated that it would not be bound by any vote lower than 60 percent in favour. Because of the strong majority support for BC-STV, the government elected to stage a second referendum in 2009,More in BC Aware of Voting Referendum from Angus Reid Global Monitor : Polls & Research but with increased public funding for information campaigns to better inform the electorate about the differences between the existing and proposed systems. The leadership of both the \\"yes\\" side and the \\"no\\" side were assigned by the government. The proposal was rejected with 60.9 percent voting against, vs. 39.1 percent in favour, in the 2009 vote. Background In 2003, the Liberal government of Premier Gordon Campbell, with the agreement of the opposition New Democratic Party, established a Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform, mandating it to propose a new electoral system, which would subsequently be put to referendum. The assembly designed and recommended a system that it named BC-STV (British Columbia Single Transferable Vote), as described in the Assembly's Final Report. A referendum was held on that recommendation in conjunction with the 2005 BC election. = STV Referendum gag law = The law governing STV advertising changed after the 2005 referendum. Although it was included as a referendum on the May 12, 2009, ballot, STV promotion was banned from election advertising. The BC Electoral Reform Referendum 2009 Act Regulation Section.29.4 (STV gag law) reads: > Referendum advertising must not, directly or indirectly, (a) promote or > oppose a registered political party or the election of a candidate, or (b) > form part of election advertising. Section.1 definition -- \\"referendum > campaign period\\" means, in relation to the referendum, the period beginning > on February 1, 2009 and ending at the close of general voting for the > referendum. First referendum The referendum was presented as a Yes/No question, with a Yes vote leading to adoption of BC-STV, and a No vote leading to retention of the existing single-member plurality system. However, the government also legislated that the referendum results would not be binding unless a supermajority of 60 percent of the voters voted the same way (and also formed a simple majority in at least 60 percent (48 of 79) of British Columbia's electoral districts).Ken MacQueen. \\"BC to Vote on Electoral Reform\\". Macleans, June 5, 2005. While a simple majority of voters in 97 percent of the electoral districts (77 of 79) voted to support the adoption of the BC-STV system, in the province-wide popular vote 57.69 percent of the population voted to support BC-STV, falling 2.3 percent short of the government-set requirement for the result to be binding. Consequently, the results of the referendum were not binding on the government, and the government did not take any steps to adopt the BC-STV system. However, a decision was taken to hold a second referendum, given how close the results were. Second referendum A second referendum on electoral reform was held in conjunction with the provincial election on 12 May 2009. The BC-STV electoral system was again voted on by the British Columbia electorate. To be binding, similar to 2005, the referendum required 60 per cent overall approval and 50 per cent approval in at least 60 per cent of the province's electoral districts. Partially addressing concerns expressed during and after the first referendum campaign, voters were able to consult a map of proposed electoral boundaries under the BC-STV system, and advocacy groups were given some public funding to campaign for and against the new electoral system. The province's voters defeated the change with only 39.09 percent voting in favour. System design =Summary of system mechanics= Since Confederation with Canada in 1871, British Columbia had a system of primarily single-member electoral districts with some multi-member districts. The 17 multi-member ridings were eliminated in 1988. Unlike the fully single-member system in place since 1988, STV groups all legislative seats regionally into multiple-member electoral districts. This is done so that seats in the region can be allocated in a way that reflects the distribution of votes among the electorate. For example, Richmond and Delta's five existing constituencies would be combined into one electoral district which would produce five winners, proportional to the votes in the multi- member district. It is very unlikely that all would be from the same party, in contrast to the situation in the 1996 election, when all five of these seats were won by the same political party. Political parties may nominate as many candidates in an electoral district as there are available seats, although experience with STV elsewhere (and all elections in general) suggests that not all will do so. For instance, in Ireland where five or more parties run candidates, a five-seat district would typically have about 10 or 15 candidates. Major parties will typically nominate more candidates in a district than will minor parties, as they will be hopeful of electing a larger number of MLAs. The most important feature of the system is that, although each voter has only one vote, their single vote may be apportioned and used to elect multiple candidates based on the voter's ranked preferences (if any). To this end, the voter is invited to rank-order candidates, although they are not required to do so. The candidates will be grouped by political party in separate columns on the ballot paper, as is the practice in the Australian state of Tasmania. However, voters would be allowed to express preferences for candidates of different parties if they chose to do so. A quota for the district is determined based on the number of valid ballots cast and the number of seats available in the district. All the votes are counted and sorted by the voters' first preferences. Those candidates with enough first- preference votes to meet or exceed the quota are elected. A multiple-step vote counting and transfer process is then used to determine the winners of the remaining seats in the district by taking voters' secondary preferences into account. Although the processing of secondary votes can be complicated, the Assembly expresses the general principle was explained in the following simplified way in the Assembly's Final Report as follows: \\"If a voter's favourite candidate (#1) is not elected, or has more votes than are needed to be elected, then the voter's vote is \\"moved\\" to his or her next most favourite candidate (#2). The vote is transferred rather than wasted. The aim of this system is to make all votes count\\" (Final Report, p. 6). =Proposed electoral district boundaries= Under the current first past the post or FPTP system, British Columbians elected members from 79 one-member districts in 2005, but this has expanded to 85 for the 2009 election. Boundaries commissions, appointed after alternate elections, use census data to maintain a nominally uniform population level across districts (within court-mandated bounds) so that voters have approximately equal representation. Currently, districts have a mean population of about 50,000. However, there can be considerable discrepancies between electoral districts, because districts are permitted to be as small as 75 percent or as large as 125 percent of the provincial average, and even these bounds may be exceeded in special circumstances. Moreover, population migrations between redistrictings can lead to further drift away from uniformity. Vancouver-Burrard has the largest population at about 67,000 people and North Coast has the smallest population at about 27,000 people. One of the criticisms of this method of is that in many populous communities, in order to create districts with a population of approximately 50,000, it may be necessary to draw arbitrary boundaries which do not necessarily reflect a community of interest. The Electoral Boundaries Commission which reported in 2008 was charged with drawing up new boundaries for both the single-member system and the proposed new BC-STV system. Under BC-STV, much larger districts would be created that will elect multiple members. Proponents argue that this creates districts with a stronger sense of community and common interest, in which voters will have several MLAs and can get service or representation from any of them. For example, the 11 new single-member constituencies within the municipality of Vancouver would be combined under STV to form two electoral districts, one West, one East. The five electoral districts within Richmond and Delta will be combined to form one electoral district. Each STV district is formed by amalgamating a collection of single-member constituencies; therefore the total number of MLAs per region, and the population per MLA within each region, is independent of the choice of system. Foreign comparisons The proposed BC-STV system was chosen by the members of the Citizens' Assembly to best suit B.C. However, it has specific similarities to and distinctions from STV electoral systems currently being used in other countries: *Unlike in elections to the Australian Senate and similar to elections in Ireland, Northern Ireland, voters will not be required to rank every candidate; the purpose of this provision is to avoid forcing voters to rank candidates they either do not know or do not support. *If votes are transferred because a candidate has exceeded the quota and been deemed elected, all of that candidate's ballots are examined for transfer votes using the Gregory method that is used for elections in Northern Ireland and to the Irish Senate (sometimes referred to as \\"Senatorial rules\\"). This is different from the Hare method used for Ireland's lower house, the D√°il, whereby after a candidate has reached the quota (after the first count) only the last parcel of votes transferred to that candidate is examined for further preferences. *In the case of a vacancy, a by-election is held using the BC-STV system. In a riding with a single vacancy, this is equivalent to the alternative vote system. This is similar to the Irish system, but differs from the system used in Malta and Tasmania, where the original ballots are recounted with the departing members' votes transferred to their next preferences.

Founded in 1939 as a tool and die forging plant, the company now consists of Taurus Armas, its firearm division, as well as other divisions focusing on metals manufacturing, plastics, body armors, helmets and civil construction. History Taurus PT 24/7 (polymer-frame) Taurus .357 Magnum Model 605 Taurus Tracker 627 .357 Magnum PT 145 with a Blued finish Taurus TCP 738, black with a blued finish Taurus produced its first revolver, the Model 38101SO, in 1941. Beginning in 1968, it exported revolvers to the U.S. market through a series of importers. In 1971, the Bangor Punta Corporation, then the parent company of Smith & Wesson, purchased 54 percent of Forjas Taurus, allowing the two firearms manufacturers to easily share information regarding design and manufacturing. In 1977, Taurus was purchased from Bangor Punta by its current owners, and its ties to Smith & Wesson were severed. In 1980, after Italian arms manufacturer Beretta had completed its contracts to produce firearms for Brazil's military, Taurus purchased Beretta's S√£o Paulo manufacturing plant along with the tooling, technical drawings, and work force necessary to produce several different pistol designs. In order to more effectively tap the U.S. market, the company created a subsidiary, Taurus International Manufacturing Incorporated, also known as Taurus USA, in 1984. In 1997 Forjas Taurus purchased the rights & equipment to manufacture Rossi brand revolvers. They currently manufacture three .38 Special models and four .357 Magnum models under the Rossi name, manufactured in S√£o Leopoldo, Brazil. In 2012, Heritage Manufacturing was also purchased and its production later moved to Taurus' Miami, Florida plant. Products The current product line includes steel-frame pistols, polymer-frame pistols, revolvers, and law enforcement weapons (submachine guns and rifles), the latter intended for the domestic Brazilian market. The company manufactures and sells its firearms for generally less than other manufacturers due to low labor costs, as well as having the facilities available to build virtually every part themselves. One writer said in 2010 that the \\"[q]uality of Taurus handguns in the modern era is second to none\\". In 2015, Taurus settled a lawsuit for $39 million and recalled nearly one million handguns produced between 1997 and 2013 due to \\"safety defects\\". =Firearm model overview= Taurus was originally known for manufacturing revolvers similar in design to those offered by Smith & Wesson. The company moved away from this realm by offering larger framed models such as the Raging Bull (.454 Casull) and Raging Hornet (.22 Hornet) revolvers as well as the Judge 5-shot revolvers (.410 bore and .45 Colt). One of Taurus' most successful semiautomatic handguns has been its PT92, a model similar to Beretta's model 92 line, but with the addition of an ambidextrous frame safety, rather than the Beretta's slide-mounted safety. The most recent addition to the Taurus pistol lineup is a copy of the Colt 1911 .45 ACP pistol, the PT1911. This slightly redesigned and updated design offers many features. =Semi-automatic pistols= * Taurus Millennium series (Models 111, 140, 145, and 745) * Taurus PT22 .22 Long Rifle *Taurus PT25 .25 ACP * PT 24/7 * Taurus TCP 732 .32 ACP * Taurus TCP 738 .380 ACP * PT92 (Models 92 and 100) * PT1911 * Taurus Model PT809, PT809c / Taurus Model 840 / Taurus Model 845 * Slim Series, 709 (9mm) and 740 (.40 S&W;) * PT-2045 * Taurus PT911 9mm (15 or 10 round) * Taurus PT 909, PT945 * Taurus PT 908 (9mm) (8 round) * Taurus PT 51 6.35mm * Taurus PT 915 9mm * Taurus PT 917 9mm * Taurus PT 938 * Taurus PT 940 .40 caliber * Taurus PT 838 * Taurus PT 838c * Taurus Curve * Taurus Spectrum * Taurus G2C G2S G3 * Taurus TX22 (22lr 16 round) =Revolvers=  Small frame  * Taurus Model 327 6 shot .327 Federal Magnum *Taurus Model 431 .44 Special * Taurus Model 405 .40 S&W; * Taurus Model 445 .44 Special * Taurus Model 605 .357 Magnum * Taurus Model 606 .357 Magnum * Taurus CIA (Models 650 and 850) - Carry It Anywhere.

Piloting a spaceship, the player explores a realistic 1:1 scale open-world representation of the Milky Way galaxy, with the gameplay being open-ended. The game is the first in the series to attempt to feature massively multiplayer gameplay, with players' actions affecting the narrative story of the game's persistent universe, while also retaining single-player options. Elite Dangerous is the fourth game in the Elite video game series, one of the longest-running video game franchises. It is the sequel to Frontier: First Encounters, released in 1995. Having been unable to agree to a funding deal with a publisher for many years, the developer began its Kickstarter campaign in November 2012. Pre-release test versions of the game had been available to backers since December 2013, and the final game was released for Windows in December 2014, with the macOS version later released in May 2015. A \\"preview\\" version of the game for Xbox One was later released via the Xbox Game Preview Program in June 2015 during Microsoft's briefing at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015, and was fully released in October 2015, while a PlayStation 4 version was released on 27 June 2017. Elite Dangerous additionally supports all PC virtual reality devices. By the end of April 2015, Elite Dangerous had sold over 500,000 copies, with Frontier Developments expected to generate ¬£22 million from sales. As of 15 January 2019, cumulative sales of Elite Dangerous exceeded 4.3 million franchise units, composed of 3 million base game units and 1.3 million Horizons expansion units.  Gameplay  An Orbis station near a habitable Earth-like planet. Players can dock at stations to trade, obtain ship upgrades or acquire missions. Upon its release in 2014, Elite Dangerous began in year 3300 and has been in sync with UTC albeit 1286 years in the future. The game is set around 45 years after Frontier: First Encounters. Elite Dangerous retains the basic premise of previous games - players start with a spaceship and a small amount of money in an open galaxy and role-play in various activities to acquire more money and merit. These activities include trading, mining, exploration, passenger-transportation, bounty-hunting, piracy and assassination. The game is the first in the series to feature online multiplayer with access to a massively multiplayer persistent world called Open Play, as well as an online- only single player mode. Open Play gameplay is similar to Eve Online in that many actions that would be considered griefing in other multiplayer games are generally permitted, as long as there is a valid roleplaying reason (e.g. robbery, extortion and blocking off star systems). However, some actions, such as \\"mob mentality\\" persecution of players, exploiting mechanics of the game (such as quitting the game in the middle of a fight to avoid death), and swearing are not allowed, and could result in a ban from the main server. Money earned throughout the game can be spent on upgrading ships or buying new ones. Players can customize their ships by changing modules, i.e., engines, weapons, scanners, etc. With the second in-game currency called Arx (also buyable with real money), players can purchase visual changes for their ships, like other coloring or cosmetic parts. Within the virtual galaxy, the player can explore some 400 billion star systems complete with planets and moons that rotate and orbit in real time, reflecting dynamic day-night cycles. Around 150,000 of the game's star systems are taken from real astronomical data, while a few partially fictional planetary systems, which were created in Frontier and First Encounters before a significant number of exoplanets were discovered, are carried over. For example, none of the gas giants of the Fomalhaut system correspond with the detected properties of Fomalhaut b. A handful of entirely fictional systems named in the original Elite, and also featured in later games, are included (e.g. the original starting system Lave). The remainder are procedurally generated according to scientific models. Players can dock their ships at space stations and outposts located throughout the galaxy in star systems to trade goods, purchase new spacecrafts, re-arm their ship, effect repairs and do missions from Mission Boards. Players may also find lost cargo or encounter other ships while in flight by investigating Unidentified Signal Sources. = Factions = There are three major factions, the Empire of Achenar, the Galactic Federation, and the Alliance of Independent Systems. Patch 1.3, which launched in June 2015, featured the Power Play addition which introduced competitive, galactical faction challenges. Players can ally themselves with an in-game faction and contribute to it by completing faction missions while also earning various rewards. The collective outcome of each faction's achievements determines faction powers, territorial control, and their proceeding objectives. Each faction has their own line of ships that are obtained by acquiring ranks within the respective faction, except Alliance ships which are not locked behind a ranking system. The Federation has four ships made by an in-game federal corporation called Core Dynamics. The Empire has four ships manufactured by Gutamaya, an Imperial corporation. The Alliance has three ships, none of which require rank, manufactured by Lakon Spaceways. = Player roles and rank = There are three archetypal player roles attached with individual rankings (also known as player status) separate from faction rankings: Combat, Exploration, and Trading. Players gain experience points and rank in these areas by completing activities that are divided among the three roles. For example, a bounty-hunter destroying pirates will gain Combat experience points and progress in Combat rank. On 15 March 2015, the first player who reached Triple Elite status (Elite rank in Combat, Elite rank in Exploration, and Elite rank in Trading), the highest status, won ¬£10,000. A certain status or rank with a faction can grant access permits to a number of systems that require them. Benefits also include ship discount prices.  Development  Starting in 2012, Elite Dangerous was developed using Frontier Development's own in-house COBRA game development engine. Frontier had been working on the game as a skunk-works background activity for some time prior to its Kickstarter launch, with other projects being prioritised. On 14 November 2014, one month before launch, David Braben announced the removal of the game's offline single player mode, the developers having decided that they could not deliver an acceptable offline-only experience based on the original design. The Windows version of the game was released on 16 December 2014. On 4 March 2015, Microsoft announced at the Game Developers Conference that Elite Dangerous would be released on Xbox One and was later launched in early access as part of Microsoft's Game Preview program during E3 in 2015. On 2 April 2015, the game was made available on Steam with support for cross-buy between the Windows version and the Mac version, the latter being released in May 2015. Although there are no plans for a Linux version of the game, Braben stated in 2014 that \\"There is no reason why COBRA cannot run on Linux, running through OpenGL.\\" A version for PlayStation 4 was released on 27 June 2017. The support of the OS X Version ended with the update 3.3 on 12 December 2018Announcement of the ending Mac support on the Frontier Forums https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/important-mac-announcement.424243/ Braben has said that Thargoids, the warlike, insectoid aliens from the original games, would make an appearance in some capacity. Mission objectives introduced in May 2015 about ancient specimens fueled speculation of the coming introduction of the Thargoid species. On 5 January 2017, the Thargoids were possibly encountered by a player. The ship encountered was alien in nature. Through an escalation of encounters, it was eventually revealed the encountered race was in fact Thargoids. While initially Thargoid encounters were non-violent, a number of space stations have since been attacked leading to missions based on investigating, researching, and gathering materials to increase weapon effectiveness against the Thargoids. On 25 October 2016, an extinct alien race, the Guardians, were added, with players allowed to explore the ancient ruins they left behind in order to gather data and materials to unlock special Guardian modules and specialized Human‚ÄìGuardian hybrid weapons with increased effectiveness against Thargoid ships. Thematically, the Guardians were discovered in the year 3302. On 9 April 2020, Fleet Carriers were added to the game, allowing players to own essentially mobile space stations for private use, though they are limited to one per player. They are exorbitantly (though not entirely prohibitively) expensive in terms of ingame currency, owing partially to the fact that they also require periodic refueling stops. = Funding = At the 2011 Game Developers Conference, following a presentation on the development of the original Elite, Braben was asked in a Q&A; session if Elite 4 was still on the drawing board. He replied \\"yes, it would be a tragedy for it not to be\\". The project had difficulty in attracting sufficient funding, which Braben had attributed to the traditional publishing model, which he saw as being biased against games with no recent comparable predecessors. Braben had previously discussed crowdfunding as a possible solution in April 2012. Public fundraising commenced in November 2012 using the Kickstarter website, the campaign lasting 60 days, with the aim being to raise ¬£1.25m and deliver a finished game by March 2014. Braben described the campaign as a way of \\"test-marketing the concept to verify there is broader interest in such a game\\", in addition to raising the funds. Following the end of the Kickstarter, further public funding was sought through the developer's UK website, via PayPal. By April 2014, ¬£1.7m had been raised, and Braben had reacquired the legal rights to the Elite franchise. Although the game's original total development budget had been ¬£8 million, by September 2014 this had, in Braben's words, \\"grown by quite a lot\\". = Testing phase = A playable alpha version of the game was released to certain Kickstarter backers in December 2013. In May 2014, the game entered the first phase of its beta test, focusing primarily on testing the systems and servers with a greater number of players. A pre-release \\"gamma\\" build was released to backers three weeks before launch, to give them a head start on other players. On 2 April 2015, the beta Mac version went live, accessible to all backers. = Horizons season of expansions = The first \\"season\\" of expansions for Elite Dangerous, named Horizons, was announced on 5 August 2015 at Gamescom, entered beta on 30 November 2015 and was released on 15 December 2015 for PC, followed by a 3 June 2016 release for Xbox One. Frontier Developments currently has no plans to release the expansion for Mac OS X unless Apple provides support for compute shaders, which Frontier believes are required to render planet surfaces and other objects. Elite Dangerous: Horizons is a separately priced product. Original customers who also purchased Horizons received exclusive access to the Cobra Mk. IV ship. Horizons adds planetary landings, ground vehicles and bases, synthesis of consumables and temporary ship upgrades, ship-launched fighters, passenger missions, a character creator, and co-op multicrew support for larger ships. Planetary landings feature procedurally generated planets, initially supporting only worlds without an atmosphere. Players can choose to set down at planetary bases or at any point of their choosing and can deploy a new eight-wheeled ground vehicle called the SRV (\\"Surface Reconnaissance Vehicle\\"). This vehicle is equipped with weapons, a \\"wave scanner\\" for finding resources, shipwrecks etc., a datalink system for hacking into bases, and thrusters that can lift the vehicle up above the ground for short periods of time. Thrusters in the wheels can be used to affix it to the ground on low-gravity worlds. Materials found on planets can be combined to boost ship jump range, synthesize repair materials, or upgrade weapons. Horizons is billed as a season of five expansions, starting with planetary landings and then followed with a more comprehensive looting and crafting system released in May 2016, ship-launched fighters and passenger missions released in October 2016, and support for multiple players working cooperatively on the same ship planned for a future expansion within the first half of 2017 ahead of PlayStation 4 release and with a 5th expansion to follow after that. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th expansions were announced originally for spring, summer and autumn 2016 respectively. But the 5th expansion had no reference to \\"winter\\", was not time-scheduled and had no content description, only stating a cryptic \\"soon\\" reference. The ability to walk around and the types of worlds players can land on is expected to be expanded during upcoming seasons, with landing on planets with atmospheres or earthlike worlds not being part of the Horizons season, but due at a later stage. An example of a character on the Holo-Me page in Elite Dangerous On 24 February 2017, due to the new discovery in the Trappist-1 system, the 2.3 update would be delayed to put it in the game. The 2.3 update called The Commanders was released on 11 April 2017, five days earlier than originally said. It consists of a 'Commander Creator' (also known as the Holo-Me), Multicrew and various other features. The 2.4 update called \\"The Return\\", with an expanded storyline for the alien Thargoids, was released on 26 September 2017. On 27 October 2020, Horizons will be a free update for the base game for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox users. People who purchased the expansion shall receive an exclusive Azure paint job which is compatible with all ships. = Beyond = Beyond is the official title for the series of updates (3.0 onwards) which followed Horizons. It focused on improvements to the core gameplay along with improvements to the game's crime and punishment system, better trading data, new wing missions, new ships (including the Alliance Chieftain, Krait, and alien Thargoid scouts), more interaction with megaships and installations, a \\"tech broker\\" offering more advanced weapons, in-game Galnet audio, an overhaul of mining, new astronomical anomalies to discover, and improvements to planetary visuals and more detailed surface environments. An open beta for 3.0 was released on 25 January 2018, with official launch of \\"Chapter One\\" on 27 February 2018. Subsequent \\"Chapters\\" were released across each quarter of 2018 culminating in the release of \\"Chapter Four\\" on 11 December 2018 that brought night vision capabilities along with a completely redesigned exploration system, planetary probes, and a Full Spectrum Scanner (FSS) tool for scanning unexplored star systems. = Odyssey expansion = Odyssey was announced by Frontier Developments on 3 June 2020 via a video trailer and summary post on their official forums, with launch scheduled for early 2021. The paid DLC will let players explore worlds on foot, undertake ground missions that, much like their cosmic counterparts, include diplomatic gigs, commercial ventures and combat; find work, assistance and shops in social hubs all across the galaxy, meeting fellow pilots in person rather than peering at them through the cockpit window. Referred to as \\"New Era\\" in prior communications, full production on Odyssey began in Summer 2018 with a large majority of the Elite development team allocated to it. While a paid-update to Elite Dangerous basegame owners, Lifetime Expansion owners will receive it as part of their Pass. It was originally planned for the Elite Dangerous major update to release in December 2020, but in the context of the current COVID-19 environment, Frontier have now set a Q1 2021 release date. = Elite Dangerous: Arena = Simultaneously announced and launched on 16 February 2016, Elite Dangerous: Arena was a low-priced standalone version of the CQC (Closed Quarters Combat) arena mode from Elite Dangerous allowing newcomers and those who already have Elite Dangerous to compete against each other. The corresponding game mode in Elite Dangerous was also renamed from \\"CQC\\" to \\"Arena\\" on the same day. From 7 to 11 July 2016, the game was offered for free on Steam. On 10 February 2017 it was removed for sale on Steam but it remains available as a play mode from the main Elite Dangerous game.  Reception  Elite Dangerous received an aggregated score of 80/100 on Metacritic based on 52 critics, indicating that the game received \\"generally positive reviews\\" from critics. Chris Thursten of PC Gamer rated the game 86/100, considering it to be \\"potentially a classic\\", depending on Frontier's ability to build on the \\"broad but somewhat shallow foundations\\" of the released version. Thursten described the gameplay experience as \\"exhilarating excitement, matched by nothing else this year, contrasted with moments of emptiness, frustration, and boredom\\". Dan Whitehead of Eurogamer gave the game 8/10 and considered it to be \\"probably the most immersive and compelling recreation of deep space ever seen in gaming\\", while finding some of the gameplay repetitive. Andy Kelly of GamesRadar gave the game 4/5, calling it a \\"compelling space sandbox\\" and a \\"welcome return\\" of the Elite franchise, but felt that the game at launch was \\"missing a lot of important features, especially when it comes to multiplayer\\". Roger Hargreaves of the Metro gave it 7/10, describing the game as a \\"solid start\\" that had yet to fulfil its potential. Reviewing the game for IGN, Rob Zacny called it \\"one of the most enthralling and evocative space combat and trade sim games I've ever played\\" and \\"also one of the most boring\\", seeing the balance of \\"brief, intense emotional peaks and long, shallow valleys of boredom\\" as \\"fundamental to Elite's identity\\". Reviewing a later version of the game in April 2015, after playing the game since launch, Lee Hutchinson from Ars Technica described Dangerous as \\"so damn good that it transcends its problems\\". Joel Peterson of Destructoid gave the PlayStation 4 version of the game 9/10, calling it \\"A hallmark of excellence. There may be flaws, but they are negligible and won't cause massive damage.\\" The announcement of the removal of the offline mode on 14 November 2014 was met by a number of complaints from customers, with some saying they had backed the game on the understanding that it would feature offline play and others that there had been no prior warning of removal during the whole of the preceding development period. Frontier offered refunds to customers who had pre-ordered the game without playing it, and said that those who had already played the game, in alpha or beta form, would not be eligible for refunds. Later, Braben, speaking for the company, announced that refunds would be judged on a \\"case- by-case\\" basis. The game had sold around 1.7 million units by the end of May 2016. By the end of December 2016 over 2.1 million paid franchise units were sold of Elite Dangerous. As of 15 January 2019, cumulative sales of Elite Dangerous exceeded 4.3 million franchise units, composed of 3 million base game units and 1.3 million Horizons expansion units. Elite Dangerous won \\"Best of E3\\" from The Escapist and games.cz in 2014. Elite Dangerous won the Game Developers Choice Award 2015 for best audience. It was ranked as the Best VR Game of 2016 from Game Revolution. It was nominated for Evolving Game by the British Academy Games Awards (BAFTA) in 2017. The game was also nominated for the \\"Still Playing\\" award at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards. Elite Dangerous: Beyond was nominated for \\"Evolving Game\\" at the 2019 British Academy Games Awards.

When this did not happen the tank was deemed unnecessary and the project terminated. A development of the TOG I design, only a single prototype was built before the project was dropped. History The second design to come out of the Special Vehicle Development Committee (nicknamed \\"The Old Gang\\" as it was made up of people who had worked on the original British tanks of the First World War) the TOG 2 was similar to the TOG 1 and kept many of its features. Instead of the track path arrangement of the TOG 1 which - like that of the First World War British tanks - ran up over the top of the hull and back down, the track path was lower on the return run and the doors were above the tracks. Ordered in 1940, built by Foster's of Lincoln, the prototype ran for the first time in March 1941. The design included a 6-pounder gun and side sponsons. For \\"initial trials\\" it was fitted with a mockup turret with a dummy gun and later with a simplified turret mounting a QF 3-inch 16 cwt anti-tank gun, in 1942 it was given a turret that was under development for the Cruiser Mk VIII Challenger tank design with the QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun. The turret \\"in modified form\\" was used on the Challenger. The planned sponsons were never fitted.Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) p 78Chamberlain & Ellis (1969) p 79 Although equipped with the same electro- mechanical drive as originally fitted to the TOG 1, the TOG 2 used twin generators and no problems were reported. It was modified to include, among other things, a change from the unsprung tracks to a torsion bar suspension and went through successful trials in May 1943. No further development occurred, although a revised version, the TOG 2 (R) was proposed. The 'R' would have been shorter, used torsion bar suspension and had no sponsons. The single TOG 2 prototype can be seen at The Tank Museum.

He is considered to be one of the film industry's most accomplished stunt drivers. In a lengthy career spanning 61 years, his body of work included classic films such as Thunder Road, Bullitt, Vanishing Point, Duel, and The French Connection. He was posthumously inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2001. Early life Loftin was born in Blountstown, Florida and grew up in Alabama and Mississippi where, he learned to ride a motorcycle when he was 10 years old. He attended high school in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, and began his stunt career at the age of 19 as a member of a traveling motorcycle stunt show in the early 1930s. Having to constantly repair and maintain motorcycles made him a proficient mechanic. After serving in the United States Marine Corps, Loftin moved to Los Angeles, California in the late 1930s where he worked as a mechanic. Film Industry career He began his career as a stuntman in the 1930s, working in serials such as Dick Tracy Returns and The Green Hornet. During the 1940s and 1950s, Loftin raced in many Southern California off-road motorcycle events such as the Catalina Grand Prix, the Big Bear Hare & Hound desert race, the Greenhorn Enduro and others. Loftin was soon being hired by film studios for his talent as a motorcycle stunt rider but, also became invaluable for his mechanical expertise on film sets. Although Loftin performed many different types of stunt work, it is his driving abilities for which he is most remembered. His stunt driving in the 1958 film Thunder Road was considered groundbreaking for its realism. He had an uncredited stunt driver role in the seminal 1966 auto racing film, Grand Prix. Loftin served as the uncredited stunt coordinator for the 1968 film Bullitt, which included one of the most influential car chase scenes in film history.Jesse Crosse, The Greatest Movie Car Chases of All Time (St. Paul: MBI Publishing, 2006), 16. He was also one of the stuntmen driving the green Ford Mustang during the chase scene filmed on the streets of San Francisco. While working on Bullitt, one of his fellow stuntmen called him \\"the greatest car man in the business\\". Loftin was also involved in the filming of the car chase scene in the 1971 film The French Connection, which is also considered one of the most impressive car chases in film history. Loftin mentioned that the hardest stunt to do during his whole career was during the final scene in White Line Fever (1975) driving the main character truck, for which he was the only hired stuntman. This later got him more iconic stuntman roles for the main characters trucks in The Great Smokey Roadblock (1977), Smokey and the Bandit (1977), Steel Cowboy (1978), High Ballin' (1978), Smokey and the Bandit II (1980) and in Over The Top (1987). Aside from being a busy stuntman, Loftin also acted in bit parts of the many films and television shows in which he performed stunts. One of his most famous, yet discreet roles was as the murderous truck driver in Steven Spielberg's Duel (billed as Cary Loftin), in which only his arm and boots can be seen. He also acted as a truck driver in Stroker Ace (1983) in which his face is never seen as in Duel, but not as a villain this time. He did, however, act as a kind of villainous car driver in Christine (1983) and similarly, as a faceless truck driver in Maximum Overdrive (1986), both in which films the machinery comes to life as evil. He did a little acting, all the stunt work and some driving scenes in Christine, where he drove the main character car and also as the guy driving the white Dodge truck with the red stripe that drops off one of the characters on a road. He also did much of the stunt work and driving scenes in Maximum Overdrive, being sole driver of the red trash truck marked \\"Zeke's Trash Removal\\" and one of two stunt drivers, along with Tommy J. Huff, of the lead character Green Goblin truck. Loftin acted as another murderous faceless truck driver in Messenger of Death (1988) again with Tommy J. Huff and had a supporting role as Skinner in the Keenan Wynn and Bob Mathias series The Troubleshooters, which aired on NBC in the 1959-1960 season. A notable demonstration of stunt driving that Loftin performed was the car chase/race in Against All Odds (1984). He was the driver of the black 1982 Ferrari 308 GTB. According to the movie's director, Taylor Hackford, Loftin was 68 when he did this stunt. At first Hackford was reluctant to hire the aging stuntman, but stunt coordinator Gary Davis convinced Hackford that, even at his age, Loftin was by far the best car man in the business at that time. Later life Loftin eventually semi-retired in 1991 at age 77 after doing Pink Lightning (1991), although he still took minor stunt roles as a truck driver. He did stunt driving for the main characters' trucks in B.J. and the Bear (1978‚Äì81) and Movin' On (1974-76). His last major role was in Black Dog (1998) for the main characters truck he did the stunt driving for. Loftin died after the movie was filmed and before the movie premiered. Loftin died of natural causes on March 4, 1997 in Huntington Beach, California, aged 83. He is a member of the Stuntmen's Hall of Fame, and the Motorcycle Hall of Fame.

Ossoli≈Ñski (plural: Ossoli≈Ñscy) is the surname of a Polish szlachta (nobility) family. Because Polish adjectives have different forms for the genders, Ossoli≈Ñska is the form for a female family member History The Ossoli≈Ñskis were a magnate family. They appeared in the historical annals at the beginning of the 14th century. The family originated from Ossolin in Lesser Poland. The progenitor of the family was Jan z Ossolina, son of Great Marshal of the Crown and castellan of Krak√≥w Nawoja z Tƒôczyna. Jan was the main heir of the property that Nawoja left after his death. Due to the tradition in medieval Poland, he started to use the surname derived from the main family seat. Grand Chancellor of the Crown Jerzy Ossoli≈Ñski was granted a hereditary princely title by Pope Urban VIII in 1633. He also received a similar title, Reichsf√ºrst, from the Emperor Ferdinand II in 1634. Another title was granted to Jerzy's cousin Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski by Louis XV, King of France, in 1736. Both titles became extinct in 1790. J√≥zef Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski's famous library assembled in Vienna was transferred to Lw√≥w, where he had located the Ossoli≈Ñski Institute in 1817. Franciszek Maksymilian Ossoli≈Ñski Coat of arms and motto The Ossoli≈Ñski family used the \\"Top√≥r\\" arms.

In 1991, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship the highest honour conferred by Sangeet Natak Akademi, India's National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama. Early life and education His mother, Madeleine Clamorgan, was from an old family of the Norman nobility; a fervent Catholic, she founded schools and a religious order, Order of Sainte- Marie, for women teachers in civilian costume under the patronage of St. Fran√ßois-Xavier. His father, Charles Dani√©lou, was an anticlerical Breton politician who held numerous national ministerial posts in the Third Republic. One of his brothers was Roman Catholic prelate and Acad√©mie fran√ßaise member, Jean Dani√©lou. He received his education at the Institution Notre-Dame de Sainte-Croix, Neuilly-sur-Seine, and at St. John's College, Annapolis. The young Dani√©lou studied singing under the famous Charles Panz√©ra, as well as classical dancing with Nicholas Legat (teacher of Vaslav Nijinsky), and composition with Max d'Ollone. Subsequently, he performed professionally on stage with dancers like Floria Capsali and Marjorie Daw. Growing up he rebelled against his mother's deep devotion to her faith, but his father remained a positive influence, which helped in developing his musical talent and in coping with his homosexuality.Emmanuelle de Boysson, Le cardinal et l'hindouiste.

Career =India: 1932‚Äì1960= He and his partner, Swiss photographer Raymond Burnier, first went to India as part of an adventure trip, and they were fascinated with the art and culture of the nation. Dani√©lou and Burnier were among the first Westerners to visit India's famed erotic temples in the village of Khajuraho and Burnier's stunning photographs of the ancient temple complex launched the site internationally. The photographs were featured in an exhibition at the New York's Metropolitan Museum. In 1932, during his first trip to India, he met one of the great influences poet Rabindranath Tagore.

In Banaras (now Varanasi), he lived a mansion on the banks of the Ganga, named Rewa Kothi. During these years, he studied Indian classical music in Varanasi with Shivendranath Basu and played the veena, which he started playing professionally. He also studied Hindi, Sanskrit languages as well as Indian philosophy. His interest in the symbolism of Hindu architecture and sculpture, lead to long trips with Burnier to Khajuraho, Bhubaneswar and Konarak, sites in central India and Rajasthan. He also translated some works of Swami Karpatri by whom he was initiated into Shaivism under the name Shiva Sharan (Protected by Shiva).Rama, Swami (1999) Himalayan Institute, Living With the Himalayan Masters, page 247.

He was one half of the tag team The Fantastics with Tommy Rogers. Professional wrestling career James Hines started wrestling as a 16-year-old, under the name Bobby Fulton. His first match was on June 17, 1977, in Clarksburg, West Virginia, in which he defeated Mad Dog Michaels by disqualification. In the main event of that same card, he lost a battle royal. He spent his early career in Ohio, training and wrestling with the likes of Lord Zoltan, Fred Curry, Bull Curry and Dr. Jerry Graham. He worked for the WWWF on the Allentown and Hamburg television tapings where he faced Steve Travis and Fred Curry. He worked for Nick Gulas's Nashville territory, where he paired up with Eric Embry as the \\"brother\\" tag team of Bobby and Don Fulton. He then moved on to Stu Hart's Calgary territory working with the likes of Bret Hart, The Dynamite Kid, The Cuban Assassin, Bobby Bass, Ross Hart, Bruce Hart, Giant Haystacks and Davey Boy Smith. Then it was on to the short-lived Knoxville territory forming a tag team with Terry Taylor called \\"The Fantastic Ones\\". After the territory closed, Hines and Taylor split up. He then moved on to the Jerry Jarrett's Continental Wrestling Association territory where he worked preliminary matches. He then went to Southwest Championship Wrestling in San Antonio, Texas for Joe Blanchard, battling Adrian Street and Eric Embry in a series of scaffold matches. His new tag team partner Tommy Rogers started for Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling. There the Fantastics (Fulton and Rogers) formed and feuded with the Midnight Express. In 1984, the team continued their feud with The Midnight Express in World Class Championship Wrestling that later extended into Jim Crockett Promotions. In 1986, they had a feud with The Sheepherders (who would become the \\"Bushwhackers\\"), Butch Miller and Luke Williams in the Universal Wrestling Federation. In 1987, back in WCCW, they feuded with the Rock 'n' Roll RPMs (Mike Davis and Tommy Lane). They won the feud by winning a scaffold match at the \\"Parade of Champions\\" on May 3, 1987. The Fantastics also made an appearance at the World Wrestling Council in Puerto Rico. They next went to the NWA's Jim Crockett Promotions to continue their feud with The Midnight Express and to win the NWA United States Tag Team Titles on two occasions. They also defeated The Sheepherders to win the vacant NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship. In 1989, they left and have been wrestling, sometimes together, sometimes not, in the independent circuit around the United States, and in All Japan Pro Wrestling. In 1990, he started his own territory in Ohio called James Hines presents Big Time Wrestling (which was a precursor to Smoky Mountain Wrestling). The federation was based primarily in Circleville, Ohio. Hines brought in talent like Hacksaw Jim Duggan, Ronnie Garvin, Abdullah the Butcher, Cactus Jack, Wahoo McDaniel, Jake Roberts, and many more to participate in regular cards held in Circleville at the Pickaway County Fairgrounds Coliseum. Hines was the Big Time Wrestling champion several times, and also often teamed with his brother, Jackie Fulton, as the Fantastics, on these cards. These cards inspired wrestlers like Shark Boy and many others to become pro wrestlers. Fulton and Ivan Koloff ran a wrestling school in North Carolina in the early 1990s. The Fantastics (Bobby and Jackie Fulton) then made regular appearances in All Japan and in Smoky Mountain Wrestling. The Fantastics made a brief appearance in the WWF in June 1997 when Fulton wrestled Rogers in what was billed as a Light Heavyweight Match. According to Fulton, they were brought in at the request of Jim Cornette to convince Vince McMahon to start a light heavyweight division, which eventually started. In October 2015, Fulton announced he will undergo a retirement tour called the \\"Fantastic Finale\\", which ended in 2017. On June 10, 2017, Fulton teamed up with \\"Big Time\\" Josh Lewis to win the NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championships from The East and West Express in NWA Supreme. The East and West Express regained the championship on June 23, 2017. In March 2016, Hines started promoting events again under the banner World Classic Professional Big Time Wrestling, in which he had an ongoing rivalry with ECW original Shane Douglas. Some of the stars who have appeared in WCPBTW include Sting, Tito Santana, Ricky Morton, Ronnie Garvin, Cowboy Bob Orton, Tony Atlas, Kevin Sullivan, J.J. Dillon, Jimmy Valiant, The Sandman, Sabu, The Barbarian, Buff Bagwell, Bobby Eaton, The Honky Tonk Man, Bushwhacker Luke, Bill Dundee, Tracy Smothers, and Tommy Rich. Fulton wrestled his final match on May 26, 2018 for his WCPBTW promotion. What originally began as a singles match against Nick \\"Kid\\" Curry, the son of Fred Curry, turned into a tag team match that saw Fulton and Nick Curry team up to defeat Gary Wolfe and Robby Starr. Following the match, Hines took off his wrestling boots and left them in the ring, signifying his retirement as a professional wrestler. He is scheduled to reunite with his brother Jackie on April 12, 2019 at NCWA's Chair City Clash in Thomasville NC in tag team action against George South and Dangerous E. On July 16, 2020, he announced his retirement.https://www.facebook.com/JamesHinesPromotions/posts/2633104220263165 Personal life Hines became a born-again Christian and also has been preaching the Christian gospel since October 2003.

Hemingstone lies in the hundred of Bosmere. It is a small parish devoted largely to fruit farming with no significant amenities other than the village hall known as \\"Hemingstone Hut\\". The residents shop at the adjacent village of Coddenham if they do not choose to go further afield. The largest employer in the village is Stonham Hedgerow, a family business manufacturing jams and preserves. History According to the 13th century Liber Feodorum (Book of Fees), the fee tail granted to Roland the Farter for the manor was conditioned on the performance of \\"unum saltum et siffletum et unum bumbulum\\" (one jump, one whistle, and one fart) at the king's court every Christmas. In 1597 the entire parish was cited before a church court for laxity. This may have been the influence of the incumbent manorial lord, Ralph Cantrell, a recusant Catholic. Hemingstone Hall is a brick-built Jacobean country house built in the early 17th century. It is a Grade I listed building. The Suffolk folk singer Percy Webb was born in Hemingstone in 1897. Parish church The parish church is dedicated to St. Gregory and is Grade I listed. It lies away from the village, just south of Coddenham on the B1078 road between Needham Market and Wickham Market.

Unveiled at the Brussels Motor Show that year, the 212 was an evolution of the 166 -- a sports car for the road that could also win international races. In 1951, two 212 Inters, both Vignale coup√©s, driven by Taruffi/Chinetti and Ascari/Villoresi, scored 1‚Äì2 victory at Carrera Panamericana in Mexico. The chassis was similar to the 125 with a suspension featuring double wishbones in front and live axle in back. Coachbuilders included Carrozzeria Touring, Ghia, Ghia-Aigle, Vignale, Stabilimenti Farina, and now Pinin Farina. The latter was an important move for the company, as Farina was already well-known and adding his styling skills would be a tremendous boost for Maranello. However, Pinin Farina was as prideful as Enzo Ferrari, and neither would go to the other to request business up to this point. A mutual meeting halfway between Maranello and Turin was the negotiated solution.Enzo Ferrari and ‚ÄúPinin‚Äù Farina: The birth of the myth. First Ferrari to be bodied by Pinin Farina was 212 Inter Cabriolet, chassis no. 0177E. The Inter's wheelbase was 4\\" longer than the Export's. The cars shared a larger, bored-out (68 mm) 2.6 L (2563 cc/156 in¬≥) version of Ferrari's Colombo V12 engine. Output was for the single Weber 36DCF carburetor Inter, for the triple Weber Export. Improved cylinder heads raised power in 1952. The British magazine Autocar got hold of what they described as the first production model Ferrari 212 in 1950, which outperformed any car that they had previously tested. It recorded a top speed of over and acceleration times of 0 to 60 mph (96 km/h) of 10.5 seconds and 100 mph (161 km/h) in 22.5 seconds; the magazine however noted they had limited the engine to 6,500 rpm out of respect for the newness and low mileage of the car they were using, which suggested that even better performance would be available from a fully \\"run in\\" model. The test appears also to have been the Autocar team's first encounter with a five speed gear box. 1952 Ferrari 212 Vignale Coupe.JPGVignale's 212 show car from 1952 Ferrari 212 Inter Vignale.jpgA 212 Inter Vignale at the Mille Miglia Storica Ferrari (3157360771).jpg212 Inter Vignale nicknamed \\"Bumblebee\\" 0177E.jpgFirst Ferrari designed by Pinin Farina, 212 Inter Cabriolet  212/225 Inter A single 212 Inter, chassis no. 0223EU, was fitted with the available 225 S or 2.7 L Colombo V12 engine, combined with a long wheelbase Europa type chassis, creating a unique model that would be properly referred to as a 225 Inter or 225 Europa. This 1952 one-off model was given a Giovanni Michelotti-penned coup√© body built by Vignale. Another 212 Inter, chassis number 0253EU, also received the 2.7 liter three-carburetor V12, and was bodied as the last Barchetta by Carrozzeria Touring in their Superleggera construction method.

He wrote such action feature movies as They Drive by Night (1940; based on The Long Haul), Desert Fury (1947), Thieves' Highway (1949), On Dangerous Ground (1952), Beneath the 12 Mile Reef (1953) and Track of the Cat (1954). He was one of the co-creators of the Western television series The Big Valley. In 1940, Warner Bros. offered Bezzerides $2,000 for movie rights to The Long Haul. He learned later that the script based on his book had already been written. The resulting film, They Drive By Night, starred Humphrey Bogart and George Raft. Bezzerides' third novel, Thieves' Market (1949), was adapted as a film titled Thieves' Highway, directed by Jules Dassin. The studio also offered Bezzerides a contract to be a screenwriter at a salary of $300 a week. At the time, he was working as a communications engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. He later commented, \\"I had no idea whether it was guilt or conscience, or greed to swindle more stories out of me, that motivated Warner Bros. to offer me a seven-year contract ... Whatever their reason, I grabbed their offer so I could quit my putrid career as a communications engineer by becoming a writer, writing scripts in an entirely new world.\\" His first film credit was 1942's Juke Girl, which starred Ann Sheridan and Ronald Reagan. Bezzerides' script for Kiss Me Deadly (1955) transformed the novel by Mickey Spillane into an apocalyptic, atomic-age paranoia film noir. When asked about his script, and his decision to make \\"the great whatsit\\" the Pandora's Box objective of a ruthless cast of characters, Bezzerides commented: \\"People ask me about the hidden meanings in the script, about the A-bomb, about McCarthyism, what does the poetry mean, and so on. And I can only say that I didn't think about it when I wrote it . . . I was having fun with it. I wanted to make every scene, every character, interesting. A girl comes up to Ralph Meeker, I make her a nympho. She grabs him and kisses him the first time she sees him. She says, \\"You don't taste like anybody I know.\\" I'm a big car nut, so I put in all that stuff with the cars and the mechanic. I was an engineer, and I gave the detective the first phone answering machine in that picture. I was having fun.\\"The Independent, A.I.

Hardy III (born January 7, 1923) is an entrepreneur and the founder and CEO of 84 Lumber Company and Nemacolin Woodlands Resort. 84 Lumber Typical 84 Lumber sign During the 1970s, 84 Lumber‚Äôs business grew and opened 229 stores. In 1984, the company undertook an expansion plan to open at least 30 new stores. Along with grand openings, stores were remodeled and renovated from no-frills lumber yards to new and improved building materials stores. In 1987, as the improvement plan generated success, the business opened their strict policy of cash-and-carry to options of using credit. Joseph Hardy's son, Joe Jr. worked his way up through the ranks and became Chief Operating Officer at 84 Lumber, however, he was passed over as successor of the company when he attracted multiple sclerosis. He would get tired easily and have to go home at a reasonable time to sleep, Joseph Hardy viewed this as a flaw and fired his son. In 1992, after 34 years of running the company, Joe Hardy handed the daily responsibility of 84 Lumber to his daughter, Maggie Hardy Magerko, who had served as Executive Vice President. The company continued to expand, opening its 400th store in 1997. With Hardy Magerko as leader, 84 Lumber began targeting construction customers and thus added a professional sales force, consisting of 450 new sales representatives, to the team. While this proved to be successful, the company was still facing stiff competition from big-box retail stores and saw the need to expand into the growing do-it- yourselfers crowd. The company opened its first retail store, 84 Plus, in 1999. In an effort to appease the retail and professional customers, 84 Plus stores featured two separate sections dividing 12,000 supplies; one section was designated for contractors while the other section was designated for do- it-yourselfers. Over a hundred 84 Plus stores opened in the United States. The early 2000s proved to be successful for 84 Lumber. In 2002, the company hit record sales and in 2004, they opened 18 new stores. In 2008, however, 84 Lumber‚Äôs profits plummeted when the housing market crashed and brought the building supplies market down with it. Vast spending and impulsive decisions contributed to a tough financial situation as well, placing 84 Lumber on the brink of bankruptcy in 2009. The situation for the company improved some years after the crash, as the market started to bounce back. With a restructuring of the workforce and the selling of company real estate, Hardy Magerko was able to turn the company around and increase sales 27 percent from 2012 to 2013. Because of his successful management of the company and his guidance to his daughter, Maggie, 84 Lumber is now the leading privately held building materials supplier to professional contractors and build-it-yourselfers in the United States. Politics Hardy announced on Sunday, September 9, 2007, at a tailgate party at Nemacolin Woodlands Resort that he was backing out of the 2007 general election for Fayette County commissioner, and thus ended his political career. Hardy finished first in vote-getting in the 2007 primary for Fayette County commissioner. Personal Hardy and his first wife (for 50 years), Dorothy, had five children, the youngest of whom, Maggie, is now president of 84 Lumber. With his second wife, Debra, he has two daughters, Taylor, and Paige. Eighty-four-year-old Hardy married Kristin Georgi, a 22-year-old salon employee at Nemacoln Woodlands Resort. Having agreed to a pre-nuptial and wedding contract, the wedding took place on Saturday, May 5, 2007 in Las Vegas, Nevada. On Monday, Aug. 20, 2007, Hardy filed for divorce, with the petition citing irreconcilable differences.http://www.heraldstandard.com/site/index.cf.?newsid=18733103&BRD;=2280&PAG;=461&dept;_id=565757&rfi;=8 Hardys fourth wife was 51-year old Rebecca Davis, whom he married in December 2009. On November 21, 2014, Hardy married Jodi Santella Williams. They have one son together, named JJ Alexander Hardy. Hardy has served on the Washington & Jefferson College Board of Trustees. Hardy has recently been quoted saying, \\"I want to die broke. For the remainder of my life, I want to enjoy and participate in the giving of money to help improve people's lives.\\"http://www.catholicgbg.org/DOGWeb/wsotft3.nsf/PageByKey/9E27FFBEF258763D85256FB9005EAB27.html References  External links  *Official Nemacolin Woodlands Resort Website *Official Eighty-Four Lumber Classic Website *Official PGA Tour Website *Official 84 Lumber Website *Pittsburghers of the Century *Uniontown Herald Standard *Channel 4, WTAE TV Category:1923 births Category:Living people Category:American businesspeople in retailing Category:American philanthropists Category:County commissioners in Pennsylvania Category:People from Fayette County, Pennsylvania Category:Swanson School of Engineering alumni Category:Washington & Jefferson College trustees Category:American retail chief executives Category:American billionaires ","title":"Joseph A.

The character is a member of the Autobots, a group of sentient self-configuring modular extraterrestrial robotic lifeforms. In most versions, Bumblebee is a small yellow Volkswagen Beetle, although since the live action movies, he has appeared as vehicles inspired by several generations of the Chevrolet American muscle cars - with the live-action film versions being a yellow Camaro with black racing stripes. The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle. The character is named after the bumblebee, a black-and-yellow striped bee which inspired his paint scheme. Bumblebee appears in most of the series and later becomes the main protagonist in Transformers: Robots in Disguise, Bumblebee, and Transformers: Cyberverse. Transformers: Generation 1 Bumblebee (known as Abejorro in Mexico, Bumble in Japan, Moscardo in Portugal, ≈∞rdong√≥ in Hungary, Maggiolino in Italy, Bourdon in France) is the \\"little brother\\" of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot faction and a mascot, constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots‚Äîespecially his leader, Optimus Prime. This often causes him to take risks that put him in danger. Although a bit of a smart aleck, he is a capable and reliable messenger and spy, his small size allowing him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments and transforms into a Saturn yellow Volkswagen Beetle. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug. =Reception= At BotCon 2010, Hasbro named Bumblebee as one of the first five robot inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame. =Animated series= The Transformers Bumblebee was the second character to appear on-screen in the original Transformers animated series, while on a mission to recover a small clutch of energy conductors with Wheeljack. Bumblebee is subsequently among the Transformers aboard the Ark, which crash landed on Earth, causing the Transformers within to be trapped in stasis for four million years. Awakening in 1984, Bumblebee helps Ironhide quell a raging river and uses his small size to help the human Autobot ally Sparkplug Witwicky plant explosives in the midst of a Decepticon mining operation. He later befriends Sparkplug's son Spike, but on their first adventure together they are both kidnapped by the Decepticons, and Bumblebee's memory chip was altered as he unintentionally lured the other Autobots into a trap. Bumblebee recovered in time to help his fellow Autobots stop the Decepticons from sending Spike to Cybertron. After their first adventure, Bumblebee and Spike became best friends for life as they both realized that they make a good team. On one of their missions, Bumblebee got injured with Spike inside from a battle with the Decepticons at a rocket base. Bumblebee was being repaired by Ratchet while his best friend was being fixed at the hospital but his mind ended up being transferred into the robot body of Autobot X, created by Sparkplug, so the doctors at the hospital can operate on his real one. When Spike left base as there was a side effect of the mind transfer, Bumblebee left afterwards to go look for his best friend but his radio transmitters weren't fixed yet. After finding Spike, Bumblebee tries to get his pal to come to his senses but failed when his best friend believed that he was tricking him. Bumblebee sees the Decepticons arriving at their location but they didn't see him so he was able to hear Megatron tell lies to his best friend, then leaving to go get Optimus Prime and the rest of his Autobot friends for help, who were helping with repairs at the rocket base they were battling at before. After arriving at the rocket base, Bumblebee tells Optimus that Megatron is manipulating Spike and that he was believing him. Bumblebee was asked to lead the way of their location by Optimus, who feared that the Decepticons would find out about Spike's messed up mind and would take advantage of the situation, so they can help their friend. Arriving where Spike was, Bumblebee and Prime tried talking some sense into him but it didn't work as they hoped it would, but they were both relieved when he did when Sparkplug was endangered. After the Decepticons left, Bumblebee gave his best friend a high five when he returned to his real body when it got all fixed up. Bumblebee's next adventure would occur when he accompanied Spike and Sparkplug with Jazz to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so they wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee returned to the headquarters he saw nobody but Bluestreak there and that Teletraan One was damaged. He then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Teletraan One, he, Bumblebee, Jazz and Spike became shocked when Teletraan One tells them that Megatron turned their friends from good to evil. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who were not affected from the personality destabilizer, Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime, Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Prime. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells his friend/leader that he's not evil and he believes in him, then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, leg which freed him from the Decepticons control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Prime as a thank you for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus Prime, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they needed to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control. Bumblebee later befriended a girl named Carly, who admired the Autobots. While testing out one of Wheeljack's inventions, Bumblebee fought the Decepticons as they wanted to steal it which they succeed in doing. After the battle, Bumblebee and Spike went looking for Carly, who left base to help them as she believed it was her fault that the Decepticons got the invention because of her due to being there when they were testing it. Bumblebee and Spike found Carly with Ironhide, who was the one who rescued her from the Decepticons, then left but they didn't get very far when they saw that their friend wasn't behind them. Transforming back into robot mode, Bumblebee wondering what was going on then saw that Ironhide was immobilized. After the rest of the Autobots showed up, Bumblebee, along with Spike and Carly hid, and all agreed that they had to do something. Bumblebee signaled Jazz to do his sound and light show which distracted the Decepticons so Carly can reverse the process of Wheeljack invention. After the battle was won, Bumblebee encourage Spike to ask Carly out knowing that they have feelings for each other. When the body of the deceased Optimus Prime is recovered from space by a pair of Transformer-hating human scientists who intend to use it to lure the Autobots into a trap, Bumblebee is part of the rescue team led by Rodimus Prime to recover it. Entering the lab, some of the Transformers are exposed to rage-inducing alien spores that could infect them with the Hate Plague, which causes them to run wild, and although Bumblebee avoids infection, he is seriously damaged by the infected rampaging Superion. A member of the alien race called the Quintessons subsequently repair and restore Optimus Prime to life, so he can stop the Hate Plague and repair Bumblebee. The little Autobot was so severely damaged that he required an entire reconstruction and is rebuilt as a Throttlebot. In his new, shiny body, he comments that he has gone beyond just being plain old Bumblebee, and is now a \\"gold bug\\", prompting Optimus Prime to redub him Goldbug. Goldbug travels with Optimus Prime to the Decepticon planet of Chaar in order to secure a heat-resistant alloy that can protect him from the plague, only to be infected on the mission and later cured when Prime uses the power of the Matrix of Leadership to purge the plague. Because of an animation error, Bumblebee appears in a wide shot in a celebration alongside with Goldbug where he was seen jumping and cheering during the series' final episode. Bumblebee and Optimus Prime are the only Autobots to appear all of the seasons, especially the first and final episode of the cartoon. Bumblebee appears in the final episode as an animation error but it counts that he is a major character that appeared. Bumblebee reappears in Generation 2: Redux, a Botcon magazine which is set after the events of the final episode as Goldbug battling the Decepticons in Switzerland along with Jazz, Sideswipe, Beachcomber and Seaspray and became Bumblebee once again in his G2 color by the power of Forestonite. Transformers: The Headmasters In Transformers: The Headmasters, Goldbug and the other Throttlebots were on Cybertron when Vector Sigma began to destabilize as a consequence of Optimus Prime releasing the Matrix's energy to cure the Hate Plague the previous year. The Decepticons soon invaded the planet in an attempt to take control of the computer, and Goldbug and the Throttlebots joined Dinobots Grimlock and Slag in holding the line against them. Unfortunately, they were knocked unconscious by the hypnotic power of the new Decepticon Headmaster Mindwipe, but they had managed to delay the Decepticons long enough for the Autobot Headmasters to arrive and take up the fight. The Throttlebots disappeared after this encounter, suggesting they might have been destroyed, but they eventually resurfaced months later as the Decepticons were carrying out their final plan to destroy the Earth. Goldbug and the Throttlebots teamed up with Fastlane and Cloudraker to investigate the emergence of a \\"Death Tower\\" in Santiago, Chile, only to find Predaking there waiting for them. Naturally, the small 'bots were no match for the powerful combiner, but they fought bravely, clinging onto his limbs before being hurled aside. Luckily, the Autobot Targetmasters arrived in time to bail them out and take Predaking down. This is also because of the budget cut that happened in the middle of the movie. =Books= Ballantine Books Bumblebee was featured in the 1985 Find Your Fate Junior books Dinobots Strike Back by Casey Todd and Battle Drive by Barbara Siegel and Scott Siegel. Kid Stuff Records & Tapes Bumblebee was featured in the 1985 audio and book adventure Satellite of Doom publishing by Kid Stuff Records & Tapes. Modern Publishing Bumblebee was featured in the 1993 Transformers: Generation 2 coloring book Decepticon Madness by Bud Simpson. =Comics= Bumblebee has appeared in numerous comic books and related media printed by various publishers.  3H Enterprises  Bumblebee appeared in the voice actor play performed at BotCon 2004, in which a device built by Rhinox to stop Unicron from pulling victims from other dimensions inadvertently transports an Autobot shuttle under Bumblebee's command into the middle of a battle between Rattrap, Silverbolt, and Waspinator and a team of Unicron's agents. Bumblebee's shuttle is able to scoop up Rattrap and company when their ship is destroyed. After saving more of Unicron's victims from the Decepticons, Bumblebee's team returns to their own time. Condor Verlag In a story called \\"By their Blasters you shall know them ...!\\" from Transformers Comic-Magazin issue #12 by German comic publisher Condor Verlag Optimus Prime instructs Backstreet, Bumblebee and Ruckus on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Bumblebee is one of those he displays to the Autobots.  Devil's Due Publishing  In Devil's Due's first G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers crossover, the evil terrorist organization Cobra are the first to uncover the Ark and the Transformers slumbering within it, capturing and reformatting a large number of them to use them as war machines. Bumblebee and Wheeljack are able to avoid this fate, contact the team created to respond to the threat of Cobra, G.I. Joe, and help to free their fellow Autobots. Unlike most Autobots, who had new alternate modes, Bumblebee and Wheeljack had their original Generation 1 alternate modes in this series. In the second crossover, Bumblebee is among the Autobots sent back in time due to an accident with the spacebridge computer Teletran-3. As part of a small group transported to the 1970s, Bumblebee is reformatted as a small economy car (this time, resembling an AMC Pacer) before the teamed-up Joes and Cobras return all the Transformers to present-day Cybertron. Bumblebee takes center stage in the third crossover series, as he, Grimlock, Arcee, and Perceptor are sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. Sporting his original alternate mode again, he is shown to have something of a crush on Arcee. When Cobra attacks the base, the Autobots help repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. Journeying to Cybertron to stop Serpentor, the mismatched group is ambushed first by Cannibalizers, then by Serpentor, Piranacon, Predaking and the Stunticons, with Bumblebee being badly injured as he runs right into Predaking's leg. He is then executed by Serpentor, who would later comment that Bumblebee's death is the only thing that ever really made him feel emotion. Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems his death is permanent, as Serpentor comments that he felt something leave him, most likely his spark. A statue to his memory was seen in the final issue. His death would continue to have repercussions, as seen in the fourth series, in which Prime insists on journeying to Earth personally rather than expose any of his troops to the same fate.  Dreamwave Productions  When Dreamwave Productions introduced their re-imagined version of Generation 1 continuity for the 21st Century, Bumblebee was present for the Autobots' new adventures once again. The War Within, set in Cybertron's past, chronicled Bumblebee's early adventures in the Battle of Altihex and the defense of Iacon in the face of an attack by Shockwave. When Optimus Prime and Megatron vanish in an early spacebridge experiment, causing the Autobots and Decepticons to splinter into smaller factions, Bumblebee remains with the Autobots under Prowl's command. As usual, Bumblebee is among the Transformers trapped in stasis aboard the crashed Ark who are reactivated on Earth in 1984. Although not depicted in fiction, the general events of the television series pilot seemed to take place in the Dreamwave continuity - with Bumblebee meeting and befriending Spike Witwicky.  Fun Publications  Classic Bumblebee was featured on the cover of Transformers Club Magazine #14. In a possible future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage director of the Autobots. Having been on the trail of the Decepticon agent Flamewar for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between Flamewar and the Tripredacus Council and reveals that his agent, Ricochet, has installed a degenerative virus into Deathsaurus's clone army. With Flamewar now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she was nothing more than a liability to the Council, who blow her ship up. Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the Marvel Comics story (ignoring all events of the Marvel UK and Generation 2 comics). Megatron has survived the crash of the Ark on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads Ramjet, Skywarp, Soundwave, Starscream, and the Constructicons. Optimus Prime has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Grimlock, Jetfire, Mirage, and Rodimus (formerly Hot Rod). In Crossing Over, when the Cybertronians Skyfall and Landquake arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away. Bumblebee appears in the story Generation 2: Redux in which he is among the reinforcements from Autobot City to respond to the Decepticon attack at the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland. Once there, the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined Forestonite, which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems. He gets enhanced to his Generation 2 form.  IDW Publishing  Fall of 2005 was the third re-launch for the Transformers comic series, this time under the management of IDW Publishing. IDW's core universe was introduced with the six-issue mini-series, The Transformers: Infiltration, making it clear that the company's take on the Generation 1 universe was radically different. Bumblebee appears as a member of a small team of Autobots under the command of Prowl, operating in secret on Earth out of Ark-19. Still a Volkswagen Beetle, he (like the other Autobots) possesses the added ability to generate a \\"holo-matter\\" avatar of a young female to masquerade as a driver and to otherwise interact with humans. Working with Ratchet and a trio of young humans to search an abandoned Decepticon base, Bumblebee is able to take down Skywarp during a Decepticon attack, out-thinking the Decepticon and shooting him out of the sky despite his teleportation system. After Blitzwing and Skywarp bring the base down, Bumblebee helps save the humans, despite commenting previously that they would be acceptable losses. As Megatron then engages the traitorous Starscream in battle, Bumblebee does what he does best by spying on the fight; almost shot by the Battlechargers, he is saved by Prowl and Jazz. In the follow-up, The Transformers: Escalation, he is left to run the Ark-19 on his own. Bumblebee was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons serving the elder gods in the IDW Publishing Infestation 2: Transformers comic. TFcon comics Bumblebee, voiced by Dan Gilvezan, appeared in the TFcon 2009 voice actor play Bee for, Bee now. Bumblebee appears among the characters in Re-Unification, the 2010 TFCon voice actor play prelude comic. =Games= Bumblebee was one of eight playable characters in the 1986 Commodore 64 video game Transformers: The Battle to Save the Earth. The Classic toy line appeared in a simple Flash-based video game on the Hasbro web site called Transformers Battle Circuit. In this one-on-one fighting game, players press the right and left arrow keys to try to overpower their opponent. Playable characters include Rodimus, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Jetfire, Starscream, Astrotrain, Trypticon, and Menasor. Optimus Prime and Megatron each appear as the boss the player must defeat to win the game. Bumblebee appears in the 2003 video game Transformers, voiced by Jack Merluzzi. Bumblebee is one of the light-blue robots in the 2010 card game Monopoly Deal Transformers. =Other merchandise= Popular Bumblebee-specific merchandise includes shirts and costumes based on the character. =Other media= A parody of the Generation 1 Transformers was aired in the December 23, 2008, episode of Frank TV, called \\"Frank the Halls\\". In the story, Optimus Prime and his Autobots (Bumblebee, Jazz, and Wheeljack) battle Megatron and his Decepticons (Soundwave and Starscream) when Optimus runs out of gas. Optimus becomes enraged at the price of gas, steals the fuel from the annoying hybrid Autobot Prius Maximus, then joins the Decepticons in destroying the city. Bumblebee appears in the Robot Chicken episode \\"Junk in the Trunk\\". In the segment he is in, he is whipped by a towel used by Grimlock in the locker room and later appears at Optimus's bedside before he dies of prostate cancer. Maggie Simpson appeared as Bumblebee in one episode's opening sequence to The Simpsons alongside the rest of the Simpson family rendered as Autobots. Transformers: Generation 2 Bumblebee is a clone of the original Bumblebee. =Fun Publications= In \\"Flash Forward, Part 3\\", Jhiaxus, seeking to create a new unified faction of Transformers, \\"borrowed\\" personality components, forestonite, Hi-Q, and blueprints from Quantum Laboratories. One of these Transformers was a clone of Bumblebee. Bumblebee, along with the other clones, were introduced to Pyro as a second generation of Transformers. In \\"Flash Forward, Part 5\\", Bumblebee and Mirage greeted a clone of Sideswipe, unaware the clone was actually the original Sideswipe. In A Flash Forward, Part 6, Bumblebee, Mirage, and Ironhide confronted the escaping Autobots, but Pyro convinced them to return to Earth with him. =Toys= *Generation 2 Go-Bot Bumblebee (1995) A redeco of Go-Bot High Beam, transforming into a yellow sports car. He features through-axle construction for incredibly fast zipping on flat, smooth surfaces, and is compatible with many tracks and playsets from Hot Wheels and Matchbox. This figure was later repurposed as the second- generation Bumblebee. This mold was also used to make Robots in Disguise (2001) Crosswise and Nightracer. Transformers: Armada Bumblebee is the Japanese name of Perceptor in Transformers: Armada. The Mini-Con Sparkplug was also based on the original Bumblebee, while Hot Shot was in fact going to be named Bumblebee but had his name changed due to trademark reasons. =Toys= *Super Collection Figure Bumble (2003) A PVC figurine was made for Perceptor/Bumble, part of the tenth act of Super Collection Figures made by Takara. There are two versions: one in cartoon colors and one in a silver color scheme. Transformers: Energon Bumblebee is a member of Rodimus's crew from Transformers: Energon. He appears only in a flashback and looks exactly like his Generation 1 counterpart. Bumblebee was originally supposed to be one of the main characters of the ‚ÄúUnicron Trilogy‚Äù but was replaced by Hot Shot. =Animated Series= Led by Rodimus, the crew left Cybertron 8,000 years ago and created a new home world on the planet Omnitron. Transformers Cinematic Universe Bumblebee appears as one of the main Autobot characters in the live-action Transformers film series and the protagonist of his own film Bumblebee. He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the horn-like pieces in his head, which are articulated in the films.Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode from his original G1 incarnation; instead of a Volkswagen Beetle, he transforms into a rally yellow Chevrolet Camaro (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Director Michael Bay states in the special features of disc two of the first film's DVD release, that the change of Bumblebee's alternate mode was due to the fact that a Volkswagen Beetle reminded him of Herbie. Due to a battle injury, he is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and television signals. Though his original voice is restored at the end of the first Transformers film, he communicates solely through his radio in Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon and Age of Extinction. The biography for the Decepticon Hardtop figure states that he and Bumblebee are old rivals and it was not Megatron who damaged Bumblebee's vocal processor, but a shot from Hardtop's gun. This is in almost direct opposition of the film's prequel. Bay stated in an early interview that Bumblebee stands about , but the official guide to the Transformers video game says he is . The vehicles used for Bumblebee, Ironhide, Jazz and Ratchet were put on display by General Motors at the 2007 Detroit River Walk Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film. In Hot Rod magazine's Nov. 2006 issue, Bumblebee was a feature article. Originally a worn-out 1969 Camaro, producers settled on a 1977 model. It is painted yellow with black stripes, primer and rust patches, riveted hood scoop, Cragar SS wheels up front, Eric Vaughn Real Wheels in the back, marine-grade vinyl seats, and even an eight-track player. The Camaro Concept model was built using a 2005 Holden Monaro by Saleen, with the body built from the same GM R&D; molds that were used in the original 2006 Camaro Concept (the Monaro and Camaro share the same Zeta platform). Bumblebee is armed with a plasma cannon that is capable of selective fire. The 1977 Camaro movie vehicle was sold on eBay with a winning bid of U.S. $40,100.01. As a tribute to the original form of Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to him at the car dealership. Bumblebee damages the Beetle in order to ensure that Sam purchases him. He also has a bee-shaped air freshener attached to his rear-view mirror with the words \\"Bee-otch\\". The air freshener was the subject of a lawsuit for $850,000 due to its alleged resemblance to another design. Since his conversion from 1977 Camaro to 2006 Camaro Concept, Bumblebee's alternate mode continues to evolve throughout the film series. = Revenge of the Fallen = In Revenge of the Fallen, he sports a different set of alloy wheels (apparently, in the first two films are actually hubcaps made from composite to look like a set of wheel-disc brake) a custom front bumper. It also comes a unique Chevrolet logo design with red outlines in it, and redesigned foglights. = Dark of the Moon = For Transformers: Dark of the Moon (now a Camaro SS), his color changes from yellow to amber with thicker black stripes that run across his hood, roof and trunk. In addition, he will have dark-colored rims and side mirrors, as well as a rear spoiler. Also, in Transformers Dark of the Moon, he has a stealth force battle mode in which he can use his weapons in car mode without fully transforming and still being able to seat a driver and passengers. = Age of Extinction = In Transformers: Age of Extinction, he transformers into a modified 1967 Chevrolet Camaro to avoid from being hunted down by Cemetery Wind. This design sports just a yellow front bumper and a rear spoiler, this vehicle is looking similar to the Dodge Hellcat. During the Autobots come to Storm KSI however, he scans a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro Concept with an all-new look, with some major changes. Now including a new front look with some advanced lamps including a dove black front bumper, black-long sideskirts, and new black rims. This time, there is only one stripes in the hood and a back license plate that says \\"900 STRA\\". People say that it is the most common license plate, it is specified that this means Mighty Stra. Sometimes he is also known as N.B.E.-02 and B-127. =Reception= Entertainment Weekly named Bumblebee as their seventh- favorite computer-generated character. IDW Publishing In Transformers: Defiance #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee, and Cliffjumper are tasked to watch over the AllSpark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room and sends Bumblebee, Camshaft, Cliffjumper, Jazz, Prowl, and Smokescreen to arrest Optimus Prime for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but while en route to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by Barricade, Brawl, Crankcase, Frenzy, Starscream, Skywarp, and Thundercracker, under orders to kill them all. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4, Arcee, Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spy on the building of the Decepticon starship Nemesis. The Transformers: Movie Prequel reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by Swindle, with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect‚Äîlaunching the AllSpark into outer space. Megatron attempts to pursue it, but Bumblebee stops him. An enraged Megatron rips Bumblebee's arms off and crushes his voice capacitor, promising to seize the AllSpark for himself eventually. Bumblebee recovers and is repaired, although his voice is damaged beyond repair. Bumblebee then volunteers to head into space to stop Megatron from acquiring the All Spark. Eventually arriving on Mars in his protoform mode, Bumblebee then proceeds to Earth in 2003, his arrival tracked by the Hubble Space Telescope. Upon landing in New York City, Bumblebee assumes the form of a beat-up Chevrolet Camaro, all the while avoiding the agents of the government organization known as Sector 7, who refer to him as NBE-2 (or Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 2). Bumblebee then downloads information on Captain Archibald Witwicky. Arriving at the asylum where he had once been incarcerated, he finds it now a dilapidated ruin. Damaged by a pursuing Barricade, he then finds AllSpark-like emissions somewhere in New Mexico‚Äîunaware it is a trap set by Sector 7. However, their plan to capture him is thwarted when Starscream, Barricade and Blackout arrive. As the Decepticons shoot Sector 7's trap to pieces, Bumblebee escapes‚Äîunaware the Decepticons had let him go so that they could follow him and see what he knew about the All Spark. He is last seen in the series heading for Tranquility, Nevada‚Äîhome of Captain Witwicky's descendant Sam. In the comic adaptation of the film, Bumblebee downloads information on the internet about the Concept Camaro car and took on its form instead of driving past in a tunnel, as seen in the film. He also appears in the official movie sequel comic called The Reign of Starscream. In Transformers: Alliance, the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City, destroying the All Spark-powered machines that were created. After Ratchet finishes repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then leave Mission City before the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. Unknowingly they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream. Bumblebee appears in Transformers: Tales of the Fallen #1, where Barricade kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the AllSpark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, who escapes in the process. Bumblebee appears in Transformers: Nefarious #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, Breakaway, Jolt, Knock Out and Dune Runner are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by Soundwave to leave, but unwilling to give in, the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes. The drone calling itself Brains runs into Bumblebee and Sam Witwicky in Philadelphia. Titan Magazines Note: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in italics. In \\"Twilight's Last Gleaming Part 3\\", Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base. Meanwhile, Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy. Bumblebee appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called \\"Return to Cybertron Part 1\\". In this story, he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron. Bumblebee returns in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called \\"The Decepticon who Haunted Himself.\\" Books Bumblebee also appears in the prequel novel Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday. Here, it is revealed he could still communicate with the other Autobots via digital link. Bumblebee is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the All Spark, and is described as one of the Autobots' best scouts. He is sent after the human vessel Ghost-1 (reverse-engineered from studies of Megatron) to make contact, but is ambushed and forced underground by Starscream. Encountering giant rock-chewing worms, he is saved by Optimus Prime. Heading into the atmosphere once again, he and Ratchet took on Barricade, but are unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel. Target Robo-Vision According to his extended biography from the Target store-exclusive Robo-Vision web site, Hardtop came to Earth and discovered the Witwicky home before any of the other Decepticons, but was unable to attack the Witwickys because Bumblebee found him first and buried him under a hundred tons of rubble in the Rocky Mountains. Bay Series (2007-2017) =Transformers (2007)= Bumblebee appears in the 2007 live- action Transformers movie, returning to his role as the friend of the Autobots' human ally ‚Äì in this case, Sam Witwicky. Sam possesses the glasses of his great-great-grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky, a famous explorer. Unknown to Sam, the glasses are engraved with the coordinates showing the location of the life-giving All Spark. Bumblebee is assigned to guard Sam from the Decepticons, and poses as a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Camaro as Sam and his father are buying a car for him. They eventually purchase Bumblebee, due in no small part to Bumblebee damaging every other car at the dealership to ensure his purchase. Later, Bumblebee drives away from Sam's home to summon the Autobots. Sam thinks Bumblebee is being stolen, and chases the car on his bike. Sam then witnesses Bumblebee transforming into robot mode and reports it to the police, who believe he is on drugs. Bumblebee returns to Sam house to come get him but he ran away from him which resulted a chase through town. After Sam gets attack by Barricade, Bumblebee came to his and his crush Mikaela Banes, who followed Sam, rescue as was able to get them away. Bumblebee battles Barricade while Sam and Mikaela battle Frenzy with Bumblebee, Sam and Mikaela ending up victorious. Bumblebee was able to earn Sam's trust when he understood that he's doesn't want to hurt them. When Mikaela criticizes the poor condition of Bumblebee's vehicle mode, he scans a passing Camaro Concept and transforms into the same model. Bumblebee then drives Sam and Mikaela to an alley where they meet the other Autobots as they properly introduced Bumblebee, due to his voice being damage in battle, to Sam and tells him that he is his guardian also they explain why he talks through the radio. They return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses, but a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam and Mikaela. The Autobots attempt to rescue them but Bumblebee is captured and taken by Sector 7. There he is tested and tortured by the Sector 7 scientists using electric shocks that appear to hurt him. Sam eventually negotiates his release. Bumblebee survives the massive battle at the film's climax, although he loses the use of his legs after helping Ironhide deflect missiles from Starscream. With Mikaela's aid, he is able to rejoin the battle supported by a tow truck (later confirmed to be the Autobot Longarm), and destroys Brawl. After the battle, Bumblebee is fully repaired and asks to stay with Sam and is granted permission from both Sam and Optimus Prime. He is later seen alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, and Optimus watching the sunset while Sam and Mikaela recline on his hood at the end of the movie. Bumblebee is voiced by Mark Ryan in the films, but he mostly speaks with his radio, having had his voice processor damaged (though his actual voice squeaks and whines laboriously through much of the movie). He also speaks with quotes from television shows and movies, in a way similar to Wreck-Gar from the 1986 film and season three of the G1 cartoon series. Screenwriter Roberto Orci explained Bumblebee regained his voice through the regenerative laser Ratchet fires at his neck as they meet, and it eventually works its magic by the end of the film. He agreed this was not made clear. Frenzy is regenerated upon coming into contact with the All Spark, and so it is entirely plausible that Bumblebee's voice, along with his legs, is also healed by the AllSpark, though no mention of this is made in the film. It was said that making Bumblebee mute was to show that his bond with Sam went beyond words. =Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)= Bumblebee also appears in the film's sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. When a fragment of the AllSpark inadvertently turns the kitchen appliances in Sam's home into feral robots, Bumblebee intervenes to save him and his family. In doing so, he nearly destroys their house. He still uses his radio to speak, despite his vocal processors being repaired in the first film. However, he does respond half-way when Sam tells him to get in the garage by saying \\"whatever.\\" Bumblebee shows excitement at the thought of going with Sam to college, only to be disappointed later when Sam tells him that he can not come. Because of the incident at the Witwickys' he is also forced to leave their garage. Soon after Sam begins his semester at college, Bumblebee follows him and tries to alert him to the Decepticon Pretender (named Alice) that is following Sam. As both Sam and Alice are riding inside Bumblebee, the Autobot attempts to warn Sam through his radio. Having failed at this, Bumblebee intentionally brakes hard multiple times and throws Alice around the interior in an attempt to damage the Pretender. Bumblebee then proceeds to spray lubricant over Alice, thereby embarrassing Sam and forcing Alice to flee. Soon after Megatron and Scalpel begin to torture Sam, Bumblebee arrives alongside Optimus Prime to fight Megatron, Starscream and Grindor. After Optimus dies, Bumblebee arrives with Sideswipe, Ironhide and Ratchet to cover Sam's escape. As they mourn for Optimus, Sam tells Bumblebee that he has failed the Autobots, but Bumblebee tells Sam through his radio, ... \\"You are the person I care for most in my life, and if there is anything you need I won't be far away...\\" After taking Sam, Mikaela, Leo and Simmons to the Smithsonian museum to reawaken Jetfire, Bumblebee then travels with the humans through a Space Bridge to Egypt (caused by Jetfire) along with Jetfire, the Twins Skids and Mudflap, and Wheelie to find the Matrix of Leadership. While the twins have a sibling argument (resulting in a fist fight) inside the ruins of Petra (which supposedly houses the Matrix when everyone thinks it is a dead end), Bumblebee breaks them up and tosses them out before seeing their fight. But once seeing the Tomb's entrance after the Twins' brawl reveals it, Bumblebee helps the humans enter it by blasting the rest of the wall off. During the final confrontational battle, Sam and Mikaela inadvertently spring a trap set by Rampage (who uses Sam's parents as the bait). Bumblebee stays hidden from Rampage's sight, allowing Sam to put Rampage in a spot where Bumblebee can initiate a surprise attack. During the subsequent fight Ravage attacks him from behind and jumps on his back. After a brief struggle, Bumblebee gets a hold of Ravage and literally tears him apart with his hands, allowing him to finish off and kill Rampage. With Sam's parents free, Sam tells Bumblebee to take care of them, thus removing him from most of the final fight. After Sam is killed by Megatron, Bumblebee arrives with Sam's parents and sees Sam's body on the ground, he is heartbroken, overcome with sadness and stricken with sorrow, believing that he has failed in his duty to protect Sam, but is overjoyed to see him return. Bumblebee is among the remaining Autobots at the end of the film. =Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011)= In Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Bumblebee no longer lives with Sam and goes on other missions with the Autobots such as dismantling an illegal nuclear facility in the Middle East. This is the first time the stealth force upgrade is shown in the movie. When Sam arrives with Carly, Wheelie and Brains, Bumblebee saves them from the soldiers taking them captive. Bumblebee is reassigned to protect Sam and moves back in with him. Bumblebee later teams up with Sideswipe and Dino/Mirage to take out Hatchet. While Dino/Mirage clings on to hatchet with his grapplers, Bumblebee and Sideswipe shoot their stealth force weapons. While trying to protect Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee and the other Autobots are betrayed and attacked by him. Sentinel brutally kills Ironhide, but Bumblebee manages to escape. After Sentinel forces the Autobots' exile from Earth, Bumblebee sadly says goodbye to Sam, but reunites with him in Chicago where he helps him rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak. After Sam kills Starscream, Bumblebee saves him and Lennox from a great fall. Bumblebee is captured by Soundwave and is nearly executed in front of Sam (telling Sam \\"We gave them a hell of a run\\") after Barricade executes Que before Wheelie and Brains save him at the cost of their own lives, allowing him to break free and attack Soundwave. Bumblebee battles Soundwave while the other Autobots fight the other Decepticons and proves more than a match for the Decepticon spy-master, even managing to kill another Decepticon during the fight. Finally Bumblebee knocks Soundwave off-balance with a shot to the leg, knocks his sonic cannon from his hand and uppercuts his plasma cannon into his chest, firing at the same time, destroying Soundwave's head and killing him. Bumblebee fights Sentinel alongside the other Autobots and humans; he is no match for him, but avoids injury. After Sam kills Dylan Gould, Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar by crashing through it, shutting off the Space Bridge and destroying Cybertron and the remaining Decepticons. Bumblebee survives the battle and gives Sam a bunch of gaskets to use as rings while playing wedding music after Sam and Carly admit they love each other. Though Sam says to Bumblebee that he's thinking too fast. He replies by 'saying', \\"I'm just trying to help out.\\" Ratchet compliments Bumblebee for his bravery. =Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)= Bumblebee returns in Transformers: Age of Extinction. He has a new vehicle mode, a modified 1967 Chevrolet Camaro, before he scans a yellow 2014 Camaro and turns into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics. In the end of Age of Extinction, Bumblebee assumed the Autobot leadership and protecting the Yeager family as Optimus blasts off to space along with the Seed, finding the mysterious Creators. Though Bumblebee mostly can't speak in the film and still relies on radio communication, he is shown to be able to express limited speech but in a more high-pitched voice, possibly meaning his voice box is healing. =Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)= Bumblebee returns in Transformers: The Last Knight, as the last appearance of this incarnation. In the former, he now displays the ability to separate and reassemble himself during combat, as shown when he battles the TRF soldiers in order to protect Cade. He is also revealed to have helped the United States Army Air Force to fight the Nazi Party during World War II, and transformed into a Mercedes-Benz 770. He also regained his voice during his battle with Optimus Prime. After Optimus Prime regains control of himself, Bumblebee and the rest of the newly allied Knights meet up with the rest of the Autobots. During the final battle, Bumblebee is shown with Hot Rod flying in a ship and is attacking Megatron and his forces. At one point, Bumblebee shoots at Infernocus, a Decepticon combiner, and is shot down. Bumblebee then leads Hound and Optimus against Megatron and Nitro Zeus. After they go weightless, Bumblebee shoots Nitro Zeus in the back of the head. Finally, Bumblebee sneaks up behind Quintessa and shoots her, supposedly killing her. Bumblebee is last seen getting ready to leave Earth to restore Cybertron with the Autobots. Bumblebee Universe (2018-present) =Bumblebee (2018)= Bumblebee is a primary focus in the spin-off and reboot movie Bumblebee, where he is the main protagonist (albeit he is designated as B-127 for the first part of the film). He first appears on Cybertron along with other Autobots, including Optimus Prime. As the Decepticon battalion overwhelms them, Optimus Prime forces a retreat and tasks B-127 with traveling to Earth and establish a base for them. Upon crash-landing on Earth in a forest, he is intercepted by Sector Seven forces, led by US Army Ranger Jack Burns, scanning a Military jeep in an attempt to escape. As he attempts to flee from them, he is ambushed by the Decepticon Seeker Blitzwing. When B-127 is subdued, Blitzwing demands the location of his comrades, but he pledges to \\"never talk\\", prompting the Seeker to rip out his voice synthesizer. Despite this, before Blitzwing can execute him, the Scout jams one of the Decepticon's own missiles into his chest before blasting it, killing Blitzwing in the detonation. With his memory cells severely damaged, B-127 scans a nearby Volkswagen Beetle before entering stasis. Brought back in vehicle mode to a junkyard, he is eventually found in a boatyard by a teenage girl named Charlie Watson, who unwittingly activates a homing signal that reaches 3 Transformers on a moon of Saturn: Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick as well as the Autobot Cliffjumper. The 2 Decepticons decide to come to Earth to hunt for B-127 instead before killing Cliffjumper. Charlie is able to get the Beetle working after some time and she drives the car home after her uncle gives it to her as a birthday gift. Back in her garage, she is attempting to fix the Beetle when a part falls out from its undercarriage, B-127 abruptly transforms after Charlie shines her light on his mechanical face. After discovering he is as afraid of the girl as she is of him, she compassionately converses with the Autobot, naming him \\"Bumblebee\\" after hearing the warbled buzzes and beeping noises he makes. The following day, Bumblebee is taught by Charlie to maintain his cover in a secluded beach, who tells him he should always assume vehicle mode unless they're alone. Bumblebee is also later discovered by Memo, a boy who has a crush on Charlie and is sworn to secrecy by her. After going on a few humorous adventures with the humans, Bumblebee is eventually discovered and captured by Sector Seven, along with Shatter and Dropkick. He is later brought to an air base where he is tortured by Shatter and Dropkick about the Autobots. They activate a holographic message in the scout of Optimus Prime intending to retreat to Earth with the other Autobots. Shatter and Dropkick resolve to in turn send a message to the Decepticons on Cybertron to invade Earth before they leave a critically injured Bumblebee for dead. He is then revived by Charlie who uses Sector Seven's high voltage guns to do so, restoring his memories. After escaping Jack Burns and his unit's attempts to hold him back, Bumblebee resolves to set out to stop the Decepticons. Upon reaching the tower where Shatter and Dropkick are, he makes Charlie hide before engaging in a fierce battle with Dropkick in a dry dam area. After a rather lengthy battle, Bumblebee uses a chain entangle Dropkick before yanking it to shred him apart, destroying him, while Charlie makes her way to the tower by climbing a nearby crane. When Jack Burns and his men arrive to try and stop Shatter as well, she shoots down their helicopter, but Bumblebee is able to catch it in time before it can crash, saving Burns' life. Charlie manages to deactivate the Cybertronian homing beacon on the tower, causing an enraged Shatter to pursue her. However, Bumblebee stops her from doing so, but is himself pinned down by the Decepticon. He blasts a nearby dam wall, causing it to give way and flood the dam. Bumblebee sinks into the waves while Shatter is crushed against a ship, destroying her as well. Charlie dives in to save Bumblebee and the pair eventually reach the surface. Afterwards, Charlie and Bumblebee head to the Golden Gate Bridge where she tearfully bids goodbye to him as she knows the scout has a greater purpose on Earth. Before driving off, Bumblebee scans and transforms into a 1977 Camaro that resembles the Camaro seen in the 2007 film. He then rendezvouses with a Red Freightliner truck on the bridge, revealed to be Optimus Prime in disguise. Meeting properly in a forest, Prime congratulates Bumblebee, assuring him that the Autobots have a future thanks to his efforts. The scout asserts his new name while witnessing more Autobots arriving on Earth. Cyber Missions In Cyber Missions 1, Bumblebee and Ironhide are protecting NEST Command when two Decepticons, Soundwave and Bludgeon invade the area. Ironhide goes outside to deal with Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes Bumblebee from inside. Bumblebee is easily thrown down by Soundwave. Bumblebee tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon is not able to take in so much, and finally falls. Later, Bumblebee traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in Cyber Missions 2.

Transformers Animated  Bumblebee appears in the Transformers Animated series in 2008 as a yellow hot hatch undercover police car (scanned from a vehicle driven by Detroit Police Captain Fanzone). The character of Bumblebee in Animated is described as a hot headed racing young Autobot who likes video games, making him more akin to Armada Hot Shot than the original Bumblebee. He does however retain the traditional warm-heartedness and human-friendly attitude of the original due to his friendship with Sari Sumdac and Bulkhead. Although considered childish and self-centered by many of his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee shows a loyal and caring side for his friends, and can be considered protective of Sari Sumdac, to the extent of blocking shots, blasts, and missiles from harming her. This was first shown in \\"Transform and Roll Out! Part 3\\" when he deflected a shot from Starscream that was aimed at Sari. The blast rendered him unconscious until Sari healed him with her Key. He is the kid-friendly character of the show.TV Review: Robots in disguise come back from '80s obscurity, January 7, 2008, University Wire Bumblebee has a retractable face plate he uses when he goes into combat and a retractable weapon (called \\"energy stingers\\") in both hands. He can use the wheels on his feet in robot mode as motorized roller blades. = Animated series = In the episode \\"Autoboot Camp\\", Bumblebee has flashbacks to his days as an Autobot trainee. During training, he met Bulkhead, Longarm, Ironhide, and Wasp. The group was under the command of Drill Sergeant Sentinel Minor, who gave Bumblebee his name (after calling him a \\"bumbler\\"). Bumblebee would often say or do the wrong thing, resulting in the entire platoon receiving Transformation push-ups as a result, which made him unpopular with Wasp and Ironhide. One day, Bumblebee heard someone communicating with Megatron. Believing the traitor to be Wasp, Bumblebee (with help from Longarm) discovered evidence in Wasp's locker. For discovering the traitor, Sentinel was prepared to give Bumblebee Elite Guard membership. However, Bumblebee gave up that chance by taking the rap for Bulkhead, who had previously knocked a building onto Sentinel, and was about to be removed from training, joining his new friend as a Space Bridge technician. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were assigned to a Space Bridge repair ship under the command of Optimus Prime, along with Ratchet. Both he and Bulkhead were the first to encounter Prowl before he joins their group. In the series finale, during a rescue mission to save Arcee, who was on the moon, Bumblebee manages to settle the score with Shockwave before he and Bulkhead put him under arrest. After the Autobots learn of Prowl's ultimate sacrifice, they take the sparkless body of Prowl and the captured Megatron, Lugnut, and Shockwave to Cybertron. On their arrival home, they are greeted and cheered on by the other Autobots for their victory over the evil and malevolent leader of the Decepticons. = Fun Publications = Bumblebee appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play Bee in the City, voiced by Bumper Robinson.

Bumblebee teamed up with transformer named \\"Joe\\" to help him and Flareup get their friends. But after Joe exposed himself as a Megatron and uses Sari's key to create an army to begin a reign of terror, Bumblebee pointed out the world's bureaucratic nature that resulted in a mutiny. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension. =IDW Publishing= Set shortly after the events of \\"Total Meltdown\\" is the Transformers: Animated comic issue #2 by IDW Publishing.

The Wraith attempts to stop Cyrus \\"The Colossus\\" Rhodes from escaping prison, but is unable to fool the villain now that the secret is public, forcing the Autobots to stop Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempts to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escapes and the other Autobots help capture The Wraith before having him placed in a mental institution. =Games= Bumblebee is one of the five playable characters in the 2008 Transformers Animated video game for the Nintendo DS.

He became skilled at sneaking around, stealing, eavesdropping and blackmailing. He eagerly joined the Autobots in hopes of finding a place to belong and where his unsavory activities would be tolerated. When the war began, Bumblebee showed extreme bravery in battle and often sought ways to be noticed by command. In time, he worked his way up the ranks of the Autobots and when the Autobot Seeker Drench was destroyed, Bumblebee was offered an upgraded form and a new identity as Goldbug, to take his place. Goldbug is paranoid that one of his fellow Autobots will betray him and try to take his place, as he did to his former superiors. =Reception= The Botcon 2008 set was chosen as the \\"Action Figure Digest Hot Pick.\\" =Fun Publications= Goldbug appears in the 2008 April Fool's comic Shattered Expectations by Fun Publications. Goldbug appears as a member of Optimus Prime's forces in the Transformers: Timelines story \\"Shattered Glass.\\" Goldbug and Blurr report to Optimus Prime the rumors that Megatron is planning an attack. When the Decepticons attack the Ark launch site Blurr, Goldbug and Rodimus compete for who could destroy the most Decepticons, but thanks to Cliffjumper the Decepticon attack is successful. Goldbug appears in the fiction Dungeons & Dinobots, a text-based story. He is among the Autobots who attack the Decepticons at the Arch-Ayr fuel dump. He is later sent to capture rogue Dinobots for the Autobots. He is part of the group that captures Swoop. In Do Over Goldbug conspires with Rodimus to take over the Autobots. Together they steal the Ark, evicting any crew members who are loyal to Optimus Prime before blasting off to Earth. The Ark then crashes on Earth. Goldbug is among the Autobots brought back online. He initially commands a small group of Autobots who find Rodimus. After losing a fight with Rodimus for leadership Goldbug participates in the attack on Burpleson Air Force Base. =Toys= Chrysler ME 412 concept car. * Timelines Deluxe Goldbug (2008) :Goldbug is a remold of Cybertron Hot Shot. He is redecoed yellow-and-black, and has a blue head remolded to look like the Generation 1 Goldbug toy. This toy is long, while a real Chrysler ME 412 is . This gives the toy a scale of 1:32. The robot mode would stand about . Aligned Continuity Bumblebee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series Transformers: Prime. Bumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box when he was captured by Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most valuable asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing the similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode \\"Deadlock\\" that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by a face plate vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors, resembling Bumblebee's original 1976 paint scheme in the 2014 Age of Extinction film. Bumblebee returns as the central protagonist of the sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise, with Will Friedle reprising his role. Set five years after the events of Prime, Bumblebee becomes the leader of a group of Autobots that end up on Earth to fight a generation of Decepticons who have re-emerge on the planet after a prison ship crash, being previously put in stasis before the war was over. In later seasons this expands to battling old enemies from Prime, Stunticons, and the corruption of Cybertron itself. A constant running gag throughout the first season is Bumblebee's inability to come up with a decent command for his team to mobilize, in the vein of Optimus Prime's famous order to \\"roll out\\". Bumblebee retains a similar vehicle mode as he did in Prime, now a 1992 Chevrolet Camaro. However, his robot mode has gone through a serious redesign. Notably retaking his original primarily yellow color scheme rather than the dominantly black one he took at the end of Prime. =Books= Bumblebee appears in the novels Transformers: Exodus and Transformers: Exiles. Bumblebee losing his voice was the focus of the short story \\"Bumblebee at Tyger Pax\\" By Alex Irvine. =Video games= Bumblebee appears as a playable character in the 2010 video game Transformers: War for Cybertron. In the Autobot campaign, he is first seen racing across the war-torn streets of Iacon in search of Optimus. Upon rendezvousing with Optimus, he relays the message of Zeta Prime's death at the hands of Megatron; after which, he joins Optimus and Ratchet in their resistance against the Decepticons on the planet. He later appears in the final level of the game, where Bumblebee teams up with Optimus and Ironhide to prevent the Decepticon Titan, Trypticon from destroying Iacon. In Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, the sequel to War for Cybertron, players start as Bumblebee in the first level. He appears throughout the game as well. =Animated series= With the exception of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is the only character to appear in all three TV shows set within the Aligned Continuity, including Transformers: Rescue Bots and Transformers: Robots in Disguise. Frank Welker recorded actual words written for Bumblebee which were later replaced with sound effects.Revealed in \\"The Autobits Edition\\" of Darkmount, NV. When Bumblebee regains his voice, it's provided by actor Will Friedle. Transformers: Prime (2010-2013) Bumblebee appears in the pilot episode of the series responding too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is captured by the Decepticons and killed. Bumblebee soon is assigned to be Raf Esquivel's guardian, having grown close to the boy as he understands his language of beeps.Transformers: Prime episode 1, \\"Darkness Rising - Part 1\\" In the \\"Operation: Bumblebee\\" two-parter, Bumblebee lost his transformation cog and its ability to have him transform before eventually retrieving the cog from human terrorist group M.E.C.H. and Starscream. Bumblebee's goal in the series is to be promoted to warrior class, as he first states in \\"Masters & Students\\". Optimus does not believe him to be worthy of promotion at such a young age. Nevertheless, Bumblebee shows he is still a capable warrior, since he is able to fight the likes of Breakdown and Shockwave. When questioned by Smokescreen in \\"Project Predacon\\", Bumblebee admits he is holding back so that he can one day be promoted to warrior class on Cybertron. In \\"Deadlock\\", during the final battle aboard the Nemesis, Bumblebee tries to give Optimus Prime the Star Saber for him to fight Megatron, but is killed by the Decepticon. However, Bumblebee fell into the ship's Omega Lock and exposure to the Cyber Matter powering it both revived him and restored his voice. As Megatron prepared to finish Optimus, Bumblebee used the Star Saber to stab him in his spark, killing him. Afterwards, once the Omega Lock restored Cybertron, Bumblebee gives Raf a goodbye before leaving for his home world where he is finally promoted to warrior class during the series finale Predacons Rising. However, things quickly turn for the worse when Unicron appears on Cybertron in Megatron's body, and two new Predacons are cloned by Shockwave. With Optimus on a mission to retrieve the AllSpark, and Ultra Magnus having been severely wounded by the new Predacons, Bumblebee becomes Autobot leader at Ratchet's encouragement as he leads them, the newly defected Knock Out and the three Predacons in making a stand against Unicron's undead Predacon army at the Well of All Sparks, buying enough time for Optimus to return to defeat Unicron. Optimus reveals that he must sacrifice himself to restore the AllSpark to Cybertron's core, and does not pass on leadership to any one person present, stating that leadership will now be earned through actions. Bumblebee promises to keep the peace on Cybertron to Optimus, implying Bumblebee to be the new leader of the Autobots, and by extension, Cybertron's new age. =Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015-2017)= Bumblebee appears as the main protagonist of the sequel series Transformers: Robots in Disguise, with Will Friedle reprising his role. In the series, Bumblebee is called to Earth when a new generation of Decepticons re- emerges on the planet. After receiving a vision from Optimus Prime, Bumblebee travels to Earth via a spacebridge and discovers that a ship full of Decepticon criminals has crashed on Earth and its inmates have escaped. Initially believing that Optimus' mission is intended for him alone, Bumblebee ends up with a team of ragtag Autobots, including a rebel bad boy bot named Sideswipe, a hyper active Mini-Con named Fixit, the bombastic ex-Decepticon and Dinobot Grimlock, and a female Elite Guard cadet named Strongarm, in order to combat the Decepticons. After befriending humans Denny Clay and his son Russell and fighting the Chompazoid Underbite, the group is greeted by the inexplicably corporeal Optimus. Unable to explain his return, Optimus expresses his confidence in Bumblebee and his new team before departing. While leading the team, to recapture the escaped Decipticons, they come across Steeljaw, an escaped convict who has his own plan to lead the other escaped convicts. The Autobots would later receive a visit from Bumblebee's old comrade Jazz, who informed Bumblebee that his actions in departing Cybertron had angered the high council. After helping apprehend a fugitive named Ped, Jazz volunteered to return to Cybertron and inform the council of what had taken place. The team then received another group of Cybertronian visitors, in the form of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, Decepticon bounty hunter Fracture, and their Mini-Con teammates. Both Cybertronians arrived to collect a bounty placed on Bumblebee by the High Council for his actions, but Drift was convinced of Bumblebee's nobility after Bee saved his life. The team managed to defeat Fracture, and though his ship was lost they gained the use of his ground bridge. After all of them but Grimlock and Fixit were given Decepticon Hunters, Bee and his team would then be forced to deal with Steeljaw's gang again‚Äînow including Thunderhoof, Underbite, and Fracture and his Mini-Cons‚Äîas both pursued the Decepticon fugitive Clampdown. Bee's team managed to capture all the Decepticons, but were forced to let them escape when Steeljaw broke free and set an unmanned garbage barge loose in the path of a riverboat. Drift and his Mini-Cons would later return to Earth and subsequently join the team. The team continued to capture escaped convicts. Bumblebee was once again contacted by Optimus with further warnings, shortly before Steeljaw and his pack managed to briefly seize the scrapyard; however, the Autobots managed to recover their base. The team soon gained another new ally in the form of the Primus-chosen female Autobot warrior Windblade, who aided the team in securing the fugitives Razorpaw and Zizza before departing. Unfortunately for Bumblebee and his team, the threat that Optimus had warned them of soon revealed itself as Megatronus, a disgraced member of the Thirteen. Having struck a deal with Steeljaw's pack, Megatronus instructed them to construct several devices he needed, which they did after capturing Strongarm, Sideswipe, and the returning Windblade. Bumblebee led the remainder of his team against them, only for Optimus arrive shortly before Megatronus made his appearance. Deferring to his former commander, Bumblebee became more concerned with Optimus' well-being and leadership than trusting in his own previous experiences. Fortunately, his team rallied behind him and gave him the courage to stand firm, which enabled them to capture Steeljaw's Pack after the would-be Decepticon tyrant was ejected from the battle by Megatronus. The Autobots then fought to prevent Megatronus from destroying both Earth and Cybertron, and managed it after discovering the latent powers of Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm's Decepticon Hunters used in tandem and copying the sword form of Optimus' Prime Decepticon Hunter. With Megatronus defeated and possibly eliminated, the Autobots departed for home, with Bumblebee at last finding his rallying cry: \\"Rev up and roll out!\\" With Megatronus defeated and most of the Pack apprehended, Bumblebee questioned whether his fellow Autobots wished to remain with him on Earth. To a one they agreed, with Windblade and Optimus formally joining the team, though Optimus did so as Bumblebee's equal rather than his superior. Turning their attention to Decepticon fugitives still scattered around the globe, Bumblebee decided to split his team by dispatching Drift, his Mini-Cons, and Windblade to seek out Decepticons in other locations while the rest of the team remained at the scrapyard. At their own insistence Optimus and Sideswipe joined the team, which ended up stranded in the Arctic after Optimus' altered state damaged their Groundbridge. Unfortunately, the remainder of the team soon had to deal with another problem: Overload, a Decepticon who had previously infiltrated the Autobot ranks and caused Bumblebee to suffer serious injuries, greatly embittering the former scout. Bumblebee became consumed with bringing Overload in, even after the Mini-Con fugitives Backtrack and Ransack were freed during their initial battle; the two Mini-Cons subsequently joined forces with Overload. Bee would continue to carry out his missions, though once he gained the ability to combine with his teammates, He became edgier on ethics during the Stunticon battles. He eventually realized that he tweaked a perfect formula for the worst, and resumed his usual command style for the rest of the show. =Transformers: Rescue Bots= Bumblebee appears in the episode \\"Bumblebee to the Rescue\\", where he helps the Rescue Bots and their human partners investigate a fallen meteor. Optimus Prime briefly assigns Bumblebee to observe how the Rescue Bots and the Burns family work together. Cody and the rest of the Burns family are unable to understand Bumblebee and requires one of the Rescue Bots to translate. The Rescue Bot Blades also happens to be a big fan of Bumblebee (who is said to be a legendary scout and war hero by the Rescue Bots). When Heatwave, Boulder, and Chase are infected by a substance contained in the meteor, Bumblebee, Blades, and the Burns family work together to destroy the meteor and obtain a sample in a hope to find a cure. Bumblebee and Blades successfully destroy the meteor and retrieve the sample, but at the cost of being infected as well, but thankfully the Burnses use an analysis of the meteor sample Bumblebee found, They are able to find a cure in the Autobots database, curing Bumblebee and the Rescue Bots. At the end of the episode, Cody is revealed to have learned how to understand Bumblebee. Before leaving, Bumblebee asks the Burnses (with Cody acting as interpreter) if they can take a picture of him and Blades. Bumblebee returns with Optimus Prime in \\"It's a Bot Time\\" and \\"Bots to the Future\\", where they go back in time to save the Rescue Bots from Dr. Morocco. They return to an alternate present with Dr. Morocco ruling Griffin Rock. They fight Morbots, while the Rescue Bots go into the city. They find out they left Dilther behind, which is how the Morbot army exists. They go back in time to take him back to the present, which is then changed back to the regular timeline. Bumblebee later returned in \\"Odd Bot Out\\", where he was sent to search for a missing Cybertronian artifact on Griffin Rock while Optimus searched the nearby seafloor. To the dismay of his biggest fan Blades, Bumblebee teamed up with Dani, who was temporarily unable to pilot Blades due to her pilot's license expiring. He returned in the season 4 episode \\"Uninvited Guest\\", making a crash landing at the training center and helping contain a stowaway Energon Eater. Will Friedle reprised his role for the final time here, co-starring with his best friend Jason Marsden. Rescue Bots Academy saw Bumblebee receive multiple mentions and pictorial cameos, until he was brought as a guest teacher in the episode \\"Bee Prepared\\", to the excitement of all the recruits, especially Wedge. Friedle had been dropped as Bumblebee's voice actor for the series, having been replaced by Jeremy Levy, who uses an identical voice used for Cyberverse Bumblebee. Kre-O Transformers Bumblebee is an Autobot warrior, and is based on the Generation 1 version of the character. =Fictional biography= =Animated series= Kreon Bumblebee appeared in the animated shorts \\"Last Bot Standing\\", \\"Bot Stars\\", \\"My Ride is Better Than Your Ride\\", \\"The Big Race\\", \\"A Gift for Megatron\\", \\"Megatron's Revenge\\", and \\"Quest for Energon, Part 1\\". =Games= Kre-O Bumblebee appears in the flash video game Kre-O Transformers Konquest. In this game Kreon Optimus Prime attempts to avoid bombs and collect parts to rebuild Kre-O Ratchet, Mirage, Prowl, and Bumblebee. Angry Birds Transformers In the 10th installment of the Angry Birds series, Angry Birds Transformers Bumblebee appears. Here he is portrayed by Chuck (Better known as Yellow Bird). Bumblebee/Chuck will have two variations, one which is yellow with black stripes based on his pre-Age of Extinction look. And one that is based on his Age of Extinction appearance. Both resemble a Dodge Challenger in vehicle mode. Transformers: Cyberverse Bumblebee is one of the main characters of Transformers: Cyberverse as well as the initial protagonist for seasons 1 and 2 before sharing the role with Optimus Prime, Cheetor for season 2 and Hot Rod for season 3's take on the Quintesson story arc.

The COB is typically the most senior enlisted person. However, the commanding officer is neither required to select the most senior in grade or in time aboard, nor is he or she required to select the highest- ranking sailor. Likewise, the COB is not necessarily replaced when a more senior rate sailor reports aboard. The selection process for a COB starts with the commanding officer's recommendation, which goes to the Naval Military Personnel Command via the squadron commander. Nominees are interviewed by other COBs. A COB also requires graduation from Senior Enlisted Academy. When a new enlisted sailor joins a boat's crew, the COB is usually one of the first people the new sailor will meet.

The majority of services to/from the railway station use Class 333 electrified trains operated by Northern Trains, on the Airedale Line to Skipton, the Wharfedale Line to Ilkley and the Leeds-Bradford Line to Leeds. The other main railway station in the city is Bradford Interchange, about 10 minutes on foot from Forster Square, from where services operate along the Caldervale Line to Leeds, Halifax, Huddersfield, Manchester Victoria, Blackpool and London King's Cross. Bradford Interchange is situated at a higher level, across the city centre, than Forster Square. The Bradford Crossrail proposal to link the two stations is currently viewed as unlikely to proceed. History Bradford Midland Station after 1887-90 rebuilding. Interior of the trainshed. The remains of the old Forster Square station. Its replacement is behind the photographer. View southward, towards buffer-stops in 1961 The original station being demolished and the new station under construction in 1992. The first rail service into Bradford was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway on 1 July 1846. The line approached the town from the north, up Bradford Dale from Shipley, and terminated at a railway station on Kirkgate, opposite the end of Market Street. There were hourly services to Leeds Wellington Station, and through trains to London Euston via Derby and Rugby. The first railway station building was an imposing neoclassical building designed by William Andrews. By 1853, the Midland Railway had acquired the Leeds and Bradford, and rebuilt the station. The new building was larger, but less interesting architecturally. In 1890, the railway station was again replaced. The Midland Railway's architect Charles Trubshaw designed a large complex containing the passenger station, goods station and the Midland Hotel. The station had six platforms and an overall glazed roof of the ridge and furrow pattern. The [train shed] roof was dismantled in the 1960s and replaced with utilitarian 'butterfly' awnings. The station was also used by the North Eastern Railway. The station began to be called Market Street Station at this time, but local maps and directories do not confirm this (see Station name below). By 1906, Forster Square had been built just south-east of the railway station, but the name Forster Square Station was not used until 1924. In March 1963, the Beeching Report recommended the closure of all railways serving Wharfedale, and the removal of several services out of Forster Square. As a consequence, many railway stations closed in 1965, and local services to Leeds ceased. However, the decision to close was deferred for some of the lines. In 1972, Bradford Corporation (now City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council), together with several other local authorities in the area, determined to subsidise the Wharfedale and Airedale lines. The lines have remained open, and in the ensuing years, a number of stations have been reopened. From April 1974, the new West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (now known as Metro) took responsibility for those services. Forster Square Station was truncated in 1990, when a new station was built on the western side of the former station. The new station has three platforms, two of which (platforms 1 & 2) are able to accommodate intercity trains. The old station was later demolished and a shopping centre called 'Broadgate' was scheduled to be constructed on the site. That development was cancelled because of the early 1990s recession, and the area was used as a car park, but a new tax office was later built there. Part of the screen arcade that fronted the 1890 station, as well as the Midland Hotel, remains. In 2005, these became much more visible, when the city centre redevelopment began and Forster House was demolished. The line into Forster Square was electrified in 1994, as part of the electrification of the Airedale Line and Wharfedale Line, which allowed through electric trains to London via the newly electrified East Coast Main Line. More recently, the pedestrian approach from Cheapside has been redeveloped, and ticket barriers installed. Historically, services have been as follows: Station name The sign outside Bradford Forster Square station in August 2007 A Class 333 unit on platform 1 Class 144 in the old station platforms, now demolished There is some disagreement about what names were used and when. Most modern references state that at least one of them was called 'Market Street', but there is disagreement as to exactly when this name was in use: * According to Alan Whitaker, it was 'Market Street' from the rebuilding in 1890 until 1924. * Tony Dewick, p. 42, shows one of the three stations as 'Market Street' in red, which in that book indicates that the station and the name passed out of use before 1901. However, contemporary sources do not seem to use the name. The Bradford Post Office Directory says that the Midland terminal is at \\"Station, bottom of Kirkgate\\" (1856, 1863, 1898) or \\"Station, Forster Square\\" (1916, 1927); only in 1928 did a directory use the name \\"Forster Square Station\\". (In contrast, from 1879/80 onward the directories show the other terminal as \\"Exchange Station, Drake St\\"). Neither the map by Dixon & Hindle nor the 1906 OS map gives a name for the station other than 'Midland Station', but the latter names 'Exchange Station'. It seems likely that the original station was called simply 'Bradford', at least until the Lancashire & Yorkshire station opened, at Drake Street in 1850. After then, it would have been the Midland Station. Later, it apparently came to be called 'Bradford Market Street', but that does not appear to have been official. Bradshaw's July 1922 Railway Guide, in a timetable footnote, refers to Market Street and gives the distance to Exchange Station. Services Trains from Bradford Forster Square are operated by Northern Trains and London North Eastern Railway. Most trains are run by Northern; these are towards Leeds (on the Leeds-Bradford Line), (on the Airedale Line) and (on the Wharfedale Line). During Monday to Saturday daytimes, trains operate every 30 minutes on each route. On weekday and Saturday evenings there are trains every hour to each of Skipton and Ilkley, but no trains run through to Leeds; instead a shuttle service runs between Bradford and Shipley, connecting there with Skipton ‚Äì Leeds trains. Connections are also available at Shipley for longer distance trains to and , although direct services to both destinations sometimes operate if the Leeds route is closed for engineering work. On Sundays, trains run hourly between Bradford and Leeds all day (until the end of service) and to both Skipton and Ilkley. The latter two routes were upgraded from two-hourly frequencies at the December 2017 timetable change. During off-peak hours most trains use platforms 1 (for Skipton) and 2 (Leeds and Ilkley) ‚Äì platform 3 is mainly used during weekday peak periods and in the evening, though a spare set is usually stabled here between 09.00 and 16.00 each weekday. London North Eastern Railway operate one service each way per day via Leeds and the East Coast Main Line to London King's Cross.

In 1995, it was the focus of a major outbreak of mass hysteria or panic which spread from Pemba to Unguja, the main island of the Zanzibar Archipelago, and across to Dar es Salaam and other urban centres on the East African coast. Meaning of the name Popobawa is a Swahili name which translates literally as \\"bat-wing\\" (from Swahili popo, \\"bat\\", and bawa, \\"wing\\"). This name is said to have originated as a description of the dark shadow cast by the spirit when it attacks at night: it does not refer to the actual form of the spirit, which is liable to change. Swahili speakers also use a plural form of the name - mapopobawa - to refer to multiple manifestations of the feared spirit. This plural is anglicized as \\"Popobawas\\". Description and behaviour Popobawa is a shapeshifter and described as taking different forms, not just that of a bat as its name implies. It can take either human or animal form, and metamorphose from one into the other. Popobawa typically visits homesteads at night, but can also be seen in the daytime. It is sometimes associated with the presence of a sulfurous odor, but this is not always the case. Popobawa attacks men, women and children, and may attack all of the members of a household, before passing on to another house in the neighbourhood. Its nocturnal attacks can comprise simple physical assault and/or poltergeist-like phenomena; but most feared is sexual assault and the anal sodomising of men and women. Victims are often urged to tell others that they have been assaulted, and are threatened with repeat visits by Popobawa if they do not. During Popobawa panics many people try to guard against attack by spending the night awake outside of their houses, often huddled around an open fire with other family members and neighbours. Panics occur most often in Zanzibar, throughout the island of Pemba and in the north and west of Unguja island, including Zanzibar City. Episodes have also been reported in Dar es Salaam and other towns on the mainland coast of Tanzania. Origin and history As legendary creatures go, Popobawa is of fairly recent origin. Sightings of the popobawa only go back about forty years; Parkin states that the first reports date back to 1965 on the island of Pemba, appearing shortly after that island's political revolution. Better-known sightings followed in 1970, and the creature resurfaced periodically in the 1980s, reaching a peak in 1995. Five years passed without a sighting, but the popobawa appeared briefly in 2000 and again in 2007. A popular origin story of Popobawa proposes that in the 1970s an angry sheikh released a Jinn to take vengeance on his neighbors. The sheikh lost control of the jinn, who took to demonic ways. It has been argued that because of Zanzibar's past as an Arab- run slave market, the story of Popobawa is an articulated social memory of the horrors of slavery (Parkin 2004). Many of the legends on Zanzibar came from the colonizers and traders of the past, including Arabs, Portuguese, Indians, Chinese, Britons, Persians and Africans. Modern Popobawa panics Reports of Popobawa attacks rise and fall with the election cycle in Zanzibar, although victims argue Popobawa is apolitical. Popobawa reports rose dramatically relatively recently, in 1995. A further spate of attacks was reported in Dar es Salaam in 2007. One explanation put forth for the election cycle connection is the claim that the Popobawa is the vengeful ghost of the assassinated President Abeid Karume, or was summoned by the Chama Cha Mapinduzi political party. Villagers maintain that Popobawa becomes enraged if his existence is denied. Popobawa allegedly spoke to a group of villagers on Pemba in 1971 through a girl possessed by the monster. The girl, called Fatuma, spoke in a man's deep voice and then villagers say they heard the sound of a car revving and rustling on a nearby roof. Many of those on the islands believe in exorcisms, and place charms at the base of fig trees, or sacrifice goats. Benjamin Radford interviewed doctors at Zanzibar Medical Group (Zanzibar's main hospital) and none reported ever treating popobawa victims. After the incidents involving Popobawa in 1995 were reported an article was published in the Skeptical Inquirer by Joe Nickell regarding the phenomenon. In the article Nickell compared the experiences described of a visit from Popobawa with the symptoms of a waking dream, also known as sleep paralysis or a hypnopompic or hypnogogic hallucination. Nickell went on to describe some of the symptoms of a waking dream as including \\"a feeling of being weighted down or even paralyzed. Alternately, one may \\"float\\" or have an out-of-body experience. Other characteristics include extreme vividness of the dream and bizarre and/or terrifying content\\". Nickell also compared these symptoms with those experienced by people who claim to have been attacked by incubi, succubi or Hags from western folklore, and in more modern cases, with alien abductions. A book released in 2017 entitled \\"Popobawa: Tanzanian Talk, Global Misreadings\\" by Katrina Daly Thompson was critical of Nickell, claiming that he was \\"associating Zanzibaris with fear and Westerners with skepticism\\". Nickell responded that he agrees \\"Westerners should be wary of imposing simplistic patterns on another culture, but they also should not shy away from making scientific observations where appropriate\\".

The constituent meetings are called Monthly Meetings in most of the world; in England, local congregations are now called Area Meetings, in Australia Monthly Meetings are called Local Meetings. \\"Monthly\\" and \\"Yearly\\" refer to how often the body meets to make decisions. Monthly Meetings are local congregations which hold worship on Sunday. Depending on the Yearly Meeting organization, there may also be Quarterly Meetings, Half-Yearly Meetings, or Regional Meetings, where a number of local Monthly Meetings come together within a Yearly Meeting. There are also parallel Yearly Meetings for young Quakers, Junior Yearly Meetings.  General description  Yearly Meeting gatherings are times for Friends from a wide geographical area to come together to worship and to seek God's guidance on decisions and on issues facing Friends in that region. Yearly Meetings publish guiding principles, organizational processes, and collected expressions of faith of the constituent Friends. These publications are called Faith and Practice, and/or Books of Discipline.  Origin  Like many aspects of Quakerism, the organization into Yearly Meetings arose gradually. English Friends began to meet shortly after their beginning in a large group starting in the 1650s. The oldest Yearly Meeting in Britain, Britain Yearly Meeting (originally London Yearly Meeting), considers the year 1668 its official founding. New England Yearly Meeting dates its founding from 1661. In the early days the business of the meeting was to receive answers to the Yearly Meeting's queries to the Quarterly Meetings, to read epistles from traveling Friends, and to seek God's guidance on actions. They also proposed and planned the establishment of Quaker institutions, such as schools. As the Religious Society of Friends grew and spread around the world, new Yearly Meetings were established. While often influenced by the activities of other Yearly Meetings, each of the Yearly Meetings is autonomous.  Procedure  A session of a Yearly Meeting, as with all Quaker business sessions, is considered a time of worship in dealing with matters of business. When a matter has been presented and explained, the Friends who are gathered wait in silence, listening to the leading of God's spirit within them. Those who feel led to do so share their insights, while the others listen. Eventually a \\"sense of the meeting\\" begins to emerge. The clerk of the meeting (a type of facilitator) or the Recording Clerk (a person who writes the minutes) tries to formulate a minute that reflects the sense of the meeting. More input may follow. When it is clear that there is agreement, the sense of the meeting is recorded in the minute. Some Friends at the meeting may have reservations about the matter but choose to defer to the others. Friends believe and hope that the minute is God's will on the matter. However, nothing is considered a permanent and inviolable law among Friends and every matter is open to future change. Before the close of a yearly meeting, Friends write an epistle to communicate to other Friends world-wide. It is the custom to read out selections from epistles the Yearly Meeting has received from other Quaker bodies during yearly meeting sessions. All Friends who are members of a constituent Meeting are members of the corresponding Yearly Meeting and may attend and participate on an equal basis‚Äîthere is no hierarchy within the Religious Society of Friends. Many specific issues of concern to Quakers are dealt with by committees appointed by Yearly Meetings.  Names  Yearly Meetings are named for where they meet: a nation (e.g., Canadian Yearly Meeting), a region within a nation (e.g., New England Yearly Meeting), a state (e.g. Indiana Yearly Meeting), or a large city that serves as a hub (e.g., Philadelphia Yearly Meeting). The entire name of a Yearly Meeting usually includes the words \\"of the Religious Society of Friends\\" (e.g., New York Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends) although some do not (e.g., Northern Yearly Meeting).  Larger groups  Many Yearly Meetings are members of larger groups. In the United States and a few other countries the three main groups of Friends are Friends General Conference, Friends United Meeting, and Evangelical Friends International. A broader group that crosses theological, organizational, and national lines and encourages communication and cooperation of the different groups is Friends World Committee for Consultation.

The Kiel-Altona line in Holstein was completed three years earlier, but the region was later lost to the German Confederation in the Second War of Schleswig. The Danish national railway operator, DSB, was established in 1885. Until recently, DSB administered most aspects of rail operations in Denmark proper, but the politically decided privatization efforts during the 1990s, has resulted in several local lines and tasks being outsourced to a number of privately owned companies. The multinational company of Arriva, is currently among the largest of these, operating c. 17% of the Danish rail network. Early steps In the 1830s, England and North Germany planned to construct a railway line between the cities of Hamburg and L√ºbeck to ease transport between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. The Copenhagen government frowned on this, as they wanted to retain waterway traffic through √òresund, but to preempt these efforts, the Danish government set up the first Danish railway commission in 1835 to establish the layout of a railway line through the Duchy of Holstein. Consequently, the railway between Altona and Kiel was opened by King Christian VIII on 18 September 1844. However, the Duchy of Holstein was only in personal union with Denmark, with the King of Denmark being Duke of Holstein, and as a result of the Second War of Schleswig, Holstein was ceded to the German Confederation in 1864. The railway line was not the first in what constituted Denmark at the time (as Holstein was part of the German Confederation), but it was nonetheless the first to be built under the Danish monarchy. In 1840, technician S√∏ren Hjorth and accountant Johan Christian Gustav Schram published the paper J√¶rnbane mellem Kj√∏benhavn og Roeskilde, in which they argued that a railway between Copenhagen and Roskilde would be profitable. However, there was no further interest in this project until 1841, when cooperation with Industriforeningen had been established. In 1843, after substantial financial recalculations, they applied for a concession to construct a railway from Copenhagen via Roskilde to a coastal town on West Zealand. This was granted about a year later, albeit not with the same level of governmental economic support as the Kiel-Altona line. On 2 July 1844 Det Sj√¶llandske Jernbaneselskab (The Railway Company of Zealand) was established with Hjorth and Schram among the board of directors. Amidst considerable resistance from landowners, trouble with unstable labour and excessive expenditures, the economic resources necessary to complete the line were provided, and the Copenhagen-Roskilde line was opened, as the first in Denmark, on 26 June 1847. English engineer William Radford led construction. Sharp Brothers and Company, in Manchester, England built the initial batch of locomotives, the first of which was named 'Odin'. Expanding the main lines thumb Following ratification of the Danish Constitution in 1849, there was political will to improve trade routes to England and provide better connections between Copenhagen and the rest of the country. The primary means for this was to extend the Copenhagen-Roskilde line to Kors√∏r, on the west coast of Zealand. During the 1850s, sufficient funding to extend the line to Kors√∏r was secured, and the new segment was opened on 26 April 1856. Before the First War of Schleswig, plans had been made in Schleswig to construct a railway from Flensburg, via Husum, to T√∂nning to limit German influence on trade. However, these plans were hampered by the war and the new political system. In 1852, the construction company Peto, Brassey and Betts (represented in Scandinavia by Samuel Morton Peto) was granted concession to build the line, which opened on 6 October 1854. The railway was very successful, carrying English transit goods until 1857, when the √òresund toll was abolished. = Zealand = The first railway lines on Zealand was constructed by the privately owned company of \\"Det Sj√¶llandske Jernbaneselskab\\" DSJ (lit.: The Zealandic Railway Company), until it was taken over by the state in 1880. This ownership change was not without issues, and in several cases DSJ refused to build additional lines or make necessary upgrades, without financial guaranties. The last lines to be built by DSJ was ‚ÄúNordvestbanen‚Äù (lit.: The Northwest Line) connecting Roskilde, Holb√¶k and Kalundborg, and ‚ÄúSydbanen‚Äù (lit.: The South Line) connecting Roskilde, K√∏ge, N√¶stved, Vordingborg and Nyk√∏bing Falster. The last parts of the line on the island of Falster, was sold almost as soon as it opened for traffic. = Jutland and Funen = In Jutland and on Funen, the state decided on a somewhat different approach to build the railways. Here the state financed and owned the lines and infrastructure right from the start, whilst trusting the daily administration of lines and trains to the private company of ‚ÄúDet danske Jernbanedriftsselskab‚Äù (lit.: The Danish Railway Operations Company). In 1862, the first line in Jutland was inaugurated, connecting the towns of Aarhus and Randers. Other lines criss-crossing Jutland north-south and east-west - including the island of Funen -, soon followed. The last railways to be laid, before major changes were made, connected the north‚Äìsouth mainline on the east coast known as ‚ÄúDen √òstjydske L√¶ngdebane‚Äù (lit.: The East Jutlandic Longitude Line) and the north-south mainline on the west coast known as \\"Den Vestjydske L√¶ngdebane\\" (lit.: The West Jutlandic Longitude Line). The line connected the towns of Lunderskov and the new port of Esbjerg specifically. By 1880, all major railway lines and companies in Denmark proper, had been bought up by the company of ‚ÄúDe Jydsk-Fynske Statsbaner‚Äù (lit.: the Jutlandic ‚Äì Fuenic State Railways) owned by the state and the company of ‚ÄúDe Sj√¶llandske Statsbaner‚Äù on private hands. In 1885 these two companies merged to form the state owned company of ‚ÄúDe Danske Statsbaner‚Äù (it.: the Danish State Railways) also known as DSB.

Introduced at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show, it replaced the 330 and 500 Superfast. 365 California The 365 California replaced the 500 Superfast for 1966. It was the first 365 model, with its 4.4 L (4390 cc/267 in¬≥) V12 based on the 330's 4.0 L Colombo unit but with an 81 mm bore. This later version of the Colombo engine was rated at 320 horsepower, in street tune using three Weber carburettors. The 365 California used the same chassis as the 500 Superfast but with an evolutionary cabriolet body by Pininfarina. Debuting at the Geneva Motor Show in 1966, just 14 examples were produced (including 2 in right hand drive) before production ended in 1967. Whilst the prototype was built on a 330 GT 2+2 type 571 chassis, production cars featured type 598 chassis. Chassis' were sent to Pininfarina's Grugliasco plant to be bodied and trimmed which were later returned to Ferrari for fitment of the mechanical components. It was presented at the 1966 Geneva Salon. On 28 June 2005, a pristine 365 California sold for ‚Ç¨736,000 (US$890,000). 365 GT 2+2 The most popular 365 model was 1967's 365 GT 2+2, replacing the 330 GT 2+2. Unlike the 330 GT 2+2 car it replaced, which had a live rear axle on leaf springs, the 365 GT 2+2 had independent rear suspension. The 365 GT 2+2 was a luxurious car with leather seats, power steering and brakes, electric windows, and optional air conditioning. It quickly became the company's top-selling model with about 800 produced in four years, 52 of which were right hand drive. When leaving the factory the 365 GT 2+2 originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).  365 GTC and GTS The 330 GTC and GTS were replaced in 1968 by the 365 GTC and GTS. It was essentially a re-engine of the 330 GTC/GTS, with the engine increasing from 4.0 liters and 300 horsepower to 4.4 liters and 320 horsepower. The styling remained almost unchanged: on both body styles differences were limited to vents moved from behind the front wheels to the bonnet. Like all 365s, the GTC and GTS were powered by a 4,390 cc Colombo V12 engine, specifically its Tipo 245/C variant. Fed by three twin-choke Weber 40 DFI carburettors, it produced at 6,600 rpm. Integrating the gearbox with the final drive gave these cars a balanced 50:50 weight distribution. The 365 GTC and GTS retained the independent rear suspension, employing coil springs and wishbones, of its immediate predecessor. Brakes were servo-assisted discs all- round with a split circuit system. 168 examples of the coup√© were built (including 22 in right hand drive) between the 1968 and 1970. It was replaced by the Ferrari 365 GTC/4. Just 20 spiders were built before its place was assumed by the 365 GTB/4-based Daytona Spider.

The gem quality specimens are typically found on Isle Royale, a large island off the Northeastern tip of Minnesota. a Michigan's State Gemstone Chlorastrolite has finely radiating or stellate (for examples, see crystal habits) masses that have a \\"turtleback\\" pattern. The stellate masses tend to be chatoyant, meaning they have a varying luster. This chatoyancy can be subtranslucent to opaque. Cholorastrolite is a variety of pumpellyite: . Chlorastrolite was once thought to be an impure variety of prehnite or thomsonite. Occurrences Chlorastrolite occurs as amygdaloid structures and fracture fillings in basalt, and when the water and wave action has worn away the basalt, they are found as beach pebbles and granules in loose sediments. It is found in the Keweenaw Peninsula of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and Isle Royale in Lake Superior. Isle Royale is a National Park, and so it is illegal to collect specimens there. It is difficult to identify an unpolished pebble of chlorastrolite. Most gem quality chlorastrolite stones are very small, and it is rare to find one that is larger than a half inch. The largest gem quality stone is in the Smithsonian Museum and measures 1.5 by 3 inches. It was first described from Isle Royale, Lake Superior by C. T. Jackson and J. D. Whitney in 1847. Chlorastrolite, also known as greenstone, is the official state gem of Michigan. Other Names *Green starstone is most common in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. *Greenstone or Isle Royale greenstone and Lake Superior greenstone. *Turtle back is a name sometimes given because of the overall pattern, particularly in polished pieces, which roughly resembles that of a turtle shell. *Uigite is a variety found on the island of Skye off the coast of Scotland. *Zonochlorite is a misnomer sometimes given rounded masses of chlorastrolite within or weathered out of amygdaloidal cavities, especially those from the area around Nipigon Bay (on Lake Superior), Ontario, Canada. Confusion may derive from the fact that zonochlorite is sold as faux chlorastrolite.

The area was variously named as Huzeog, Hossegge, Huzeseg, Hwzeseg, Ousage, Ouzage, Owsage and Ussage.https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/herts/vol2/pp337-342#h3-0012https://archive.org/details/eastbarnet00cass The land was sold after the Dissolution of the Monasteries and a large house was built and parkland laid out. A condition of tenure was that the woods should supply faggots for the burning of heretics. In 1614 the estate passed by marriage to Robert Berkeley, and in 1652 the house became the residence of four generations of the Hadley family. Following the death of John Hadley in 1744 the house was demolished and the estate sold. A new Osidge House was built by 1808 and later occupied by the Lambert and Bosanquet families, being purchased by David Bevan for his eldest child Louisa Bosanquet.

The Christian Communion International has a church on Osidge Lane, in the former Veterans Hall. Osidge and Southgate Osidge is not seen as a separate locality by most local residents but is regarded as part of Southgate; addresses are occasionally given as Osidge, Southgate. This is technically incorrect, as the area lies outside the pre-1965 Borough of Southgate and the current parliamentary constituency of Enfield Southgate. There are several probable reasons for this confusion. Firstly, they are largely in the same postal district, N14 (although so too is Oakwood, and the northern part of Osidge is in the EN4 district). Secondly, Osidge is close to Southgate tube station and to Southgate's main commercial hub on Chase Side. In addition, Osidge House - for centuries the most prominent dwelling in the district - has main access from Chase Side, a road forming part of the border of Edmonton Hundred, Middlesex, with Southgate its nearest village. St Andrew's Southgate is the closest parish church to Osidge House, and its origins are as a chapel-of-ease to Christ Church, Southgate;Dumayne, Alan Southgate A Glimpse Into the Past, 1987, in 1902, The London Gazette reported on the granting of a Baronetcy to Thomas Lipton, the first and only 'Baronet of Osidge' giving his address as \\"Osidge, in the parish of Southgate.\\"https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/27457/page/4738 The history of Osidge has therefore been covered by local historians of the Southgate area, while being recorded officially in histories of East Barnet. Despite this association, a 1992 Boundary Commission Report rejected proposals to incorporate most of the Osidge area into Enfield borough, partly on grounds of objections from Barnet council, local schools and residents that \\"the Osidge community identified itself with Barnet\\".https://www.lgbce.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0015/11913/672.-london- borough-of-enfield-and-its-boundaries-with-barnet-lb,-hertsmere-borough,-in- hertfordshire,-broxbourne-borough,-in-hertfordshire-and-welwyn-hatfield- district,-in-hertfordshire.pdf References External links * Ordnance Survey map of Middlesex 1868-1883 Category:Areas of London Category:Districts of the London Borough of Barnet ","title":"Osidge"},{"id":"1896179","text":"Wallace Stanfield \\"Stan\\" Lane (born August 5, 1953) is an American retired professional wrestler and color commentator. He is best known for his appearances with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA), Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in the 1980s. Primarily a tag team wrestler, Lane held championships including the AWA Southern Tag Team Championship, NWA United States Tag Team Championship, NWA World Tag Team Championship, and SMW Tag Team Championship as part of The Fabulous Ones, The Midnight Express, and The Heavenly Bodies. Professional wrestling career =Championship Wrestling from Florida (1978‚Äì1980; 1986‚Äì1987)= Lane was trained by Ric Flair, debuting in 1978. He initially wrestled primarily for Championship Wrestling from Florida. =Continental Wrestling Association / United States Wrestling Association (1981‚Äì1985; 1990‚Äì1991)= In 1982, Stan Lane went to Mid-South Wrestling and formed a team called The Fabulous Ones with Steve Keirn. The team feuded with The Midnight Express, Jerry Lawler & Bill Dundee, The Sheepherders (Butch Miller & Luke Williams), Randy Savage & Leapin' Lanny Poffo and The Moondogs with whom they had a series of exceptionally bloody matches. They were also pioneers in the \\"MTV style\\" of promotion, creating promotional videos and spectacular entrances with their popular theme song \\"Everybody Wants You\\" by Billy Squier. The Fabulous Ones was actually started in Memphis by Jerry Jarrett & Jackie Fargo. In December 1990, to fans' excitement, he reformed the Fabulous Ones with Keirn briefly in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with Cornette as their manager. On January 7, 1991, they won the USWA Tag Team titles, defeating Tony Anthony and Doug Gilbert. Three weeks later, on January 28, after a controversial match with Jeff Jarrett and Jerry Lawler, the titles were held up; a week later, on February 4, the rematch for the held-up titles was held and they lost the match and the titles to Lawler and Jarrett. =American Wrestling Association (1984‚Äì1986)= =Jim Crockett Promotions / World Championship Wrestling (1987‚Äì1990)= In early 1987, Dennis Condrey left Jim Crockett Promotions abruptly, leaving former partner Bobby Eaton & manager Jim Cornette as a tag-team with only one member. Enter a man that Eaton was very familiar with and who was no stranger to tag-team wrestling, Stan Lane formerly of The Fabulous Ones. Lane and Eaton knew each other well from working against each other in the past and this showed as the new version of the Midnight Express jelled from the beginning. Early on, \\"Sweet\\" Stan added a deep radio \\"DJ voice\\" for manager Jim Cornette that would enrage the crowd. In May 1987 the combination of Eaton and Lane proved to be a golden one as they won the NWA US Tag-Team titles (a title they would win three times during their time together). A year later the team was cheered on to victory as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag-Team Titles from Four Horsemen members Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard (See also: Brain Busters) on September 10, 1988. This feat meant that they were the first tag-team to ever hold both the NWA World tag-team and NWA United States tag-team titles, a feat only the Steiner Brothers would go on to duplicate in 1991. The Express' run with the belts was a short one; they were defeated by The Road Warriors in a match that marked Hawk and Animal's first title reign. Frustrated by their inability to win the tag belts in previous years, the Warriors and manager Paul Ellering had decided to return to their roots as violent thugs who would do anything to win. This new attitude soon paid off with a title victory over Lane and Eaton. On October 29, 1988, the Midnights' reign came to a quick and violent end in New Orleans. At the beginning of the match, Ellering brutally attacked Express manager Jim Cornette outside the ring. When Lane jumped in, the Warriors battered and bloodied Eaton, leaving Lane to fight both Hawk and Animal essentially on his own. Eaton was eventually able to tag in, but was quickly overwhelmed by Animal and pinned after a vicious clothesline. Now the fan favorites the Midnight Express soon had to contend with a blast from the past, The Original Midnight Express as it consisted of Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose, who had teamed up before Condrey and Eaton became a team. During the November 5 episode of WCW Saturday Night, Jim Cornette (kayfabe) received an anonymous phone call, as the caller ridiculed Cornette over Eaton and Lane's loss of the NWA World Tag Team Championship to The Road Warriors on October 29. Cornette recognized the caller and basically asked him to come say it to his face. At that point, Dangerously and the Original Midnight Express hit the ring and proceeded to pummel Cornette and Stan Lane, who was wrestling in a singles match. By the time Bobby Eaton showed up, it was three on one. Cornette showed up the next week on TBS carrying his blood stained suit jacket and the feud was on. The teams wrestled at Starrcade '88, but nothing was solved. The Midnights vs. Midnights would be the hottest feud in WCW for months, building up to a six-man tag match involving the managers on pay-per- view in February 1989. The one who got pinned would have to leave the promotion. However, WCW (the former Jim Crockett Promotions) was under new ownership and in transition at the time and many wrestlers were coming and going. At the last minute, Condrey decided to leave WCW. Jack Victory was brought in as his replacement and the match went forward, but at this point no one really cared. Due to various booking issues, Jim Cornette and the Midnight Express left the promotion for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner brought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation as the National Wrestling Alliance / World Championship Wrestling. When the booking issues started to clear up, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the federation and a very strong tag-team division. One of those teams was The Dynamic Dudes (Shane Douglas and Johnny Ace), who admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed but the Midnight Express were not happy about it at all. After arguing, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying the Express to the ring, choosing to only manage the Dudes. At the Clash of Champions IX the two teams met with Jim Cornette in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites and when the night was over the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express. After their heel turn, the Midnight Express started feuding with Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the recently re-activated US Tag-Team titles, winning the gold from the young team in early 1990. The Midnight Express would lose the titles to The Steiner Brothers three months later. After appearing at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up when Cornette and Lane left the federation, due to conflicts with Jim Herd and booker Ole Anderson. For the first time in seven years there was no Midnight Express; it was the end of an era in tag-team wrestling. =Independent circuit (1990‚Äì1992)= During 1991-1992, Lane competed in multiple independent wrestling organizations, including the Tri State Wrestling Alliance, the Global Wrestling Federation (GWF), the WWA, South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (SAPW), the AWF, the VWA, and the IWA. During his stay in the GWF he wrestled and lost to The Patriot in matches for the TV and North American heavyweight titles. During his stay in the AWF, Stan Lane competed against Paul Orndorff in the heavyweight title tournament, but lost in the final match, but Lane later won the title. Lane also held the tag team title with Jeff Collette in the VWA, and was managed by The Big Cheese during his time in the IWA.Inside Wrestling, The Wrestler, Pro Wrestling Illustrated =Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1992‚Äì1993)= In 1992, Lane and Cornette went to Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW), to form a new team called \\"The Heavenly Bodies\\" with Tom Prichard. They feuded with The Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the tag team titles 5 times, until he retired from the ring after losing a loser leaves town match and was replaced in the team by Jimmy Del Ray. =World Wrestling Federation (1993‚Äì1995)= Lane retired in 1993 and went to work for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), as a member of the WWF's broadcast team. He began as a color commentator alongside Vince McMahon on WWF Superstars. He then went on to become the host of WWF Wrestling Challenge in 1994, where he worked with Ted DiBiase and Gorilla Monsoon. Lane also did voiceover work of matches that were taped exclusively for Coliseum Video. He worked with DiBiase and Monsoon for those also. He also worked as a commentator in Ted DiBiase's promotion, WXO. =Independent circuit (1999‚Äì2005)= Lane left the WWF in late 1995 and retired. Lane returned in the late-1990s and again reformed \\"The Fabulous Ones\\" for a few cards in Bert Prentice's NWA Wildside promotion to wild fan reception. In 2004, Lane wrestled on several shows with Condrey and Eaton in the independent promotions in the Mid-Atlantic area. He retired from all wrestling in 2005.

As a frequent partner of Jay Gould in various transactions, he amassed a fortune. Olivia Slocum Sage, his second wife, inherited his fortune, which was unrestricted for her use. In his name she used the money for philanthropic purposes, endowing a number of buildings and institutions to benefit women's education: she established the Russell Sage Foundation in 1907 and founded the Russell Sage College for women in 1916. Early life and family Sage was born at Verona in Oneida County, New York. He received a public school education and worked as a farm hand until he was 15. He started as an errand boy in his brother Henry's grocery in Troy, New York. He had a part interest in 1837‚Äì1839 in a retail grocery in Troy, and in a wholesale store there in 1839‚Äì1857. On January 23, 1840, Sage married Marie-Henrie Winne, who was also known as \\"Maria Winne\\". They had no children. She died on May 7, 1867, of stomach cancer. In 1869 at the age of 53, Sage remarried, to Olivia Slocum (1828‚Äì1918), who was ten years younger. Political career In 1841, Sage was elected as alderman in Troy. He was re- elected to this office until 1848, while also serving for seven years as treasurer of Rensselaer County. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a Whig, and served, with re-election as an Oppositionist, from March 4, 1853 until March 3, 1857. He served on the Ways and Means Committee. Sage was the first person to advocate in Congress for the purchase of George Washington's plantation, Mount Vernon, by the government. Subsequently, Sage settled in New York City, and engaged in the business of selling puts and calls and privilegesPrivileges were options sold over the counter in nineteenth-century United States, with both puts and calls on shares offered by specialized dealers. Their exercise price was fixed at a rounded-off market price on the day or week that the option was bought, and the expiry date was generally three months after purchase. They were not traded in secondary markets. on Wall Street. Olivia Slocum Sage in 1910 In 1869, Sage was involved in a legal case concerning the usury laws in New York state, in which he was accused of being the leader of a usury group. He was convicted and fined $500, but his jail sentence was suspended. That year he remarried, to Olivia Slocum of Syracuse, New York. Financial career Sage bought a seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1874, and became known as a financier. At the same time he saw the future of railroads, and secured stocks in western roads, notably the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway. He was president and vice-president for twelve years. By selling such investments, as the smaller roads were bought by major trunk-lines, he became wealthy. In his later years Sage was closely associated with Jay Gould in the management of the Wabash Railway, St. Louis and Pacific, Missouri Pacific Railroad, Missouri-Kansas-Texas Railroad, Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the St. Louis - San Francisco Railway, for which he was director of the corporations. He also served as director for the American cable company, the Western Union telegraph company, and the Manhattan consolidated system of elevated railroads in New York City. Sage was also a director of the Union Pacific Railroad, which was part of constructing the transcontinental railroad. Together with other major investors (and railroad robber barons of the nineteenth century), he made a fortune. He was a director and vice- president in the Importers and Traders' National Bank for twenty years, and also a director in the Merchants' Trust Company and in the Fifth Avenue Bank of New York City. Assassination attempt In 1891, Henry L. Norcross entered Sage's office in a six-story 1859 brownstone office building at 71 Broadway in Manhattan, claiming he needed to discuss railroad bonds. Norcross gave Sage a letter demanding $1,200,000, which Sage declined to pay. Norcross was carrying a bag of dynamite, which exploded, killing Norcross, wounding Sage, and severely wounding William R. Laidlaw, Jr., a clerk for John Bloodgood and Co. who happened to be in the office. Afterward Laidlaw sued Sage, alleging that he had used him as a shield against Norcross. Disabled for life, Laidlaw aggressively pursued the lawsuits, winning $43,000 in damages after four trials, but a Court of Appeals reversed the award. Sage never paid any settlement and was publicly criticized as a miser because of his great fortune. New York Court of Appeals, William R. Laidlaw, Respondent, v. Russell Sage, Appellant, 158 N.Y. 73, Jan. 10, 1899 The journal (New York [N.Y.), March 7, 1896]New York Supreme Court, General Term, LAIDLAW v. SAGE, 30 N.Y.S. 496, 80 Hun, 550, Oct. 12, 1894 Personal life Sage was known to have affairs outside marriage both before and after the death of his first wife. The writer Paul Sarnoff suggested in his biography of Sage that he may have remarried for appearance's sake, and may never have consummated his second marriage. Sage was reported to have had a child by a young chambermaid.Sarnoff (1965) Sage was a member of East Presbyterian Church on West 42nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenue, which later merged with Park Presbyterian to form West-Park Presbyterian.Presa, Donald G. (January 12, 2010) \\"West Park Presbyterian Church Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Sage's mausoleum in Oakwood Cemetery In 1906 Sage died and left his entire fortune of about $70 million to his wife, Olivia Slocum Sage (1828‚Äì1918). He was buried in a mausoleum in Oakwood Cemetery in Troy, New York. The mausoleum is of a Greek style and is intentionally unnamed. To the left of the memorial is a bench which contains a relief of Medusa on the center of the back, complete with snakes as hair. Legacy and honors Olivia Sage devoted a major portion of the money she inherited from her husband to philanthropy, including buildings and other memorials to him. She commissioned Ralph Adams Cram, a leading architect, to design Russell Sage Memorial Church, and for Louis Tiffany to create a large stained glass window as a memorial. Built in 1908, the church was located in Far Rockaway, Queens, where the family had a summer home. In 1907 she established the Russell Sage Foundation, and in 1916 founded Russell Sage College in Troy. In addition she gave extensively to the Emma Willard School and to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI) in Troy, her husband's home town.Of the two buildings named \\"Russell Sage\\" at RPI, the Russell Sage Dining Hall is named for his nephew, Russell Sage II. See: \\"Sage Dining Hall\\" on the RPI website During World War II the Liberty ship was built in Panama City, Florida, and named in his honor. References Notes Bibliography * Myers, Gustavus.

Early Life Amelio was born in San Pietro di Magisano, province of Catanzaro, Calabria. His father moved to Argentina soon after his birth. He spent his youth and adolescence with his mother and his grandmother. The absence of a paternal figures will be a constant in Amelio's future works. During his university studies of philosophy in Messina, Amelio got interested in cinema, writing as film critic for a local magazine. In 1965 he moved to Rome, where he worked as operator and assistant director for figures such as Liliana Cavani and Vittorio De Seta. He also worked for television, directing documentaries and advertisements. Amelio's first important work is the TV film La citt√† del sole, directed in 1973 for RAI TV and inspired to Tommaso Campanella's work. This was followed by Bertolucci secondo il cinema (1976) a documentary about 1900 shooting, and the thriller Effetti speciali. Two years later he directed the mystery La morte al lavoro, which won prizes at Locarno and Hy√®res festivals. The Little Archimedes (Il piccolo Archimede) of 1979 was also critically acclaimed. In 1982 he debuted for cinema proper with Blow to the Heart (Colpire al cuore), about Italian terrorism, presented at the Venice Film Festival. In 1987 Amelio released I ragazzi di via Panisperna, about the lives of 1930 Italian physicists such as Enrico Fermi and Edoardo Amaldi, which won the award for best screenplay at the Bari Film Festival. 1989's Open Doors (Porte aperte), featuring Gian Maria Volont√©, confirmed Amelio's status as one of Italy's best film directors and won a nomination as Best Foreign Film at 1991 Academy Awards. The film received also four Felix, two Silver Ribbon, four David di Donatello and three Golden Globes awards. Also successful was The Stolen Children (Il ladro di bambini) in 1992, which won the Special Prize of Jury at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival plus two Silver Ribbon and 5 David di Donatello. In 1994 Lamerica, about Albanian immigration in Italy, repeated the fate and the success, with 2 Silver Ribbons and 3 Davids. Four years later, The Way We Laughed (Cos√¨ ridevano) won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival. Amelio gained another Silver Ribbon as best director for The Keys to the House (Le chiavi di casa), inspired to a novel by Giuseppe Pontiggia, of 2004. Amelio was a member of jury at the Cannes Film Festival in 1995. In 2006 he released his eighth feature film, The Missing Star (La stella che non c'√®), featuring Sergio Castellitto.

The old Anderson Island School Anderson Island is the southernmost island in Puget Sound and a census-designated place of Pierce County, Washington, United States. It is accessible by boat or a 20-minute ferry ride from Steilacoom. Anderson Island is just south of McNeil Island. To the northwest, Key Peninsula is across Drayton Passage. The south basin of Puget Sound separates the island from the mainland to the southeast, while to the southwest the Nisqually Reach of Puget Sound separates the island from the mainland. Geography Anderson Island has a land area of , and reported a population of 1,037 persons as of the 2010 census. The island has been a retirement destination since the late 1960s, with a median age of 54 years (for comparison, the median age of Washington state as a whole is 37 years).Anderson Island: Block Group 3, Census Tract 726.03, Pierce County, Washington United States Census Bureau The population booms every summer to approximately 4,000. The Island is also home to a sizable population of deer. History A farm on Anderson IslandThe Anderson Island ferry loading dock at Yoman RoadThe island was named in 1841 by Charles Wilkes of the United States Exploring Expedition. Given a warm reception at Fort Nisqually by Mr. Anderson and Captain McNeill, and assistance to aid his operations, Wilkes repaid their kindness by naming the two nearby islands after these two men. In 1870, Andrew N. Christensen, a Dane, and his brother, Christian F. Christensen, were the first European settlers to stay at the island. Andrew's wife had a strong hand in the development of the island community. Christian was the only Christensen brother to reside permanently on Anderson Island. The primary industry was the sale of wood to the wood-burning steamers that came into Amsterdam Bay. Other early industries included brick making, farming and fishing. The only General Store on the island is run by Dr. and Mrs. Lake, of Steilacoom. In 2004, National Recreational Properties, Inc. of Irvine, California purchased more than 400 vacant lots on the island, paying roughly $4,000 to $7,000 per lot. They created an infomercial and sold to out-of-state investors, mostly from California. Residents speculated that the lots would be sold for about $25,000. Eventually more than 300 lots were sold, most selling for over $40,000. Ferry Accessible only by ferry or private boat, Anderson Island is served by the Steilacoom / Anderson Island / Ketron Island run, the only ferry run belonging to Pierce County.Pierce County's Ferry fleet The ferry Steilacoom II was put into service in January 2007 to work with the aging ferry Christine Anderson. The ferry runs many times per day, starting at 5:45 in the morning, and going to 10:30 pm on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays (8:00 pm other nights). Government The Anderson Island Citizens Advisory Board (AICAB) is a governing advisory board reporting to the Pierce County Council, established by the Pierce County Council in 2004. Examples of its past actions include banning of boats with internal combustion engines from Lake Josephine, road repair and speed recommendations, as well as other matters common to governing Anderson Island. Fire District #27 and the Anderson Island Parks District are taxing districts that serve only Anderson Island. The Steilacoom Historical School District serves Anderson Island. Children in grades K‚Äì5 attend school on the island, while children in grades 6‚Äì12 commute to the mainland each day. The Anderson Island School is designated a \\"remote and necessary\\" school by the State of Washington, and is one of the few remaining such schools in the state. Tanner Electric Co-op provides electrical power to Anderson Island via a submarine cable. It extends across Nisqually Reach on the south end of the island and was replaced in 2010., Tanner Electric Law enforcement is provided by the Pierce County Sheriff's office. Media and Further Reading The Island Sounder, published by the Anderson Island Association, is the island's monthly newsletter. The News Tribune from Tacoma is available to subscribers.

It pioneered several interface and game play innovations which were later used to greater popular success by games such as Ultima Online. Notable Contributions A screenshot from DartMUD =DartMUD \\"Firsts\\"= The actual dates of the first implementation of these ideas in MUDs or MMORPGs are not well documented and competing claims exist, but DartMUD was first, among the first, or an early adopter of the following: * Permanent Death: DartMUD is targeted at hard-core mudders, people willing to risk permadeath -- a common occurrence -- in order to make their accomplishments that much more meaningful. * Hex-Based Wilderness Map: DartMUD implements a hex map in ASCII text an innovation which helped shape later games. * Numberless Interface: DartMUD differs from earlier LPMuds in that it is class-less and level-less. Attributes, skills, hit points, and magical aura are represented using generalized text descriptions, rather than specific numbers. * Crafting: DartMUD has had a three-stage crafting system since 1992. Initially, the system allowed for in-game farming (resource extraction), milling (resource refinement), and cooking (finished goods creation). The system has since been expanded to include wood, metal, cloth, stone, and ceramic-based skills, as well as herding, hunting, and gathering, allowing for a relatively comprehensive model of a medieval economy. * Player-Run Economy: DartMUD attempts to model a realistic economy: storekeepers don't have everything players need, nor do they automatically purchase anything a player acquires. Of all the innovations listed here, a Player-Run Economy has been the most problematic and contentious, and multiple tweaks to the economic model have been made in an attempt to balance realism and game play. =Reception and influence= Game designer and industry author Raph Koster has mentioned DartMUD as an influential game in general Koster comments that at one point he listed DartMUD as one of the most influential online worlds and regarding many specific topics, such as hex mapping, Raph Koster discussing Dartmud's innovation in wilderness mapping for online games simulationism, player-run economy, and crafting. Koster post on DartMUD's influence on Ultima Online's crafting system Other mud developers have occasionally mentioned DartMUD on MUD-DEV, the MUD Developers' mailing list. Koster and others often cite DartMUD as an innovative MUD that failed or fell short in execution. MUD-Dev message, RE: [MUD-Dev] Seminal Designs, WAS: Alignment MUD-Dev message, [MUD-Dev] Re: after the plague: mud reportMUDDev Archive :: View topic - Room descriptions DartMUD was one of twelve MUDs selected, by virtue of its Google search ranking, to receive player surveys by authors Anthony Faiola and Alexander E. Voiskounsky while researching their paper \\"Flow Experience of MUD Players: Investigating Multi-User Dimension Gamers from the USA\\". = Design Considerations = The primary limitation on character actions is a 'concentration' system. The exercise of player skills reduces the chance that a subsequent skill check (of any skill, not just the same skill) will be successful. This penalty goes away fairly quickly, but it serves to prevent abuse based on the speed of prepared (e.g. client-side macro) input. The founders of DartMUD decided to try to capture the unpredictability of the Rolemaster RPG's open-ended die rolling system using a custom implemented Cauchy distribution function. The unpredictable extremes of the Cauchy function have occasionally resulted in very memorably improbable results. DartMUD also uses a seeded random number generator, which allows for certain similar \\"random\\" events to produce identical results, simulating the pointlessness of attempting certain actions twice: if an action failed once, it will fail again unless something has changed in a subsequent attempt. Creatures in DartMUD possess \\"shapes\\" -- a creature's shape file determines how many limbs it has, how many objects it can hold, natural armor, relative size and durability, and effects when one or more limbs are disabled. Players may choose races which have from four to eight limbs, including one to four hands.  Game World  = Skills = DartMUD is a classless system, which means any skill may be learned by anyone. However, only some skills can be self-taught; others must be learned from a non-player character (NPC) or player teacher. Many skills aren't taught by NPCs, forcing a greater level of player interaction. Skills are improved by practicing relevant tasks of increasing difficulty, not by spending experience points. While DartMUD doesn't have classes, requirements to practice skills to improve them and positive feedback for learning similar skills provide incentive for characters to specialize, encouraging player interdependence. Due to the player-run economy, crafting skills provide greater game rewards than thief skills. In fact, since thieves mainly prey on other characters in DartMUD, they are generally hunted and killed if discovered. Since combat is not required to advance, some players thrive despite avoiding violence altogether. = Role Playing = In DartMUD, roleplaying (RP) is not enforced by the staff. Rather, a confluence of factors -- prominent among them permadeath, player interdependence, and the desire for wealth -- create an unsimulated political system. \\"An armed society is a polite society\\" (Robert A. Heinlein) is a good summation: characters behave themselves in public and do their scheming behind closed doors. Using out-of-character communications to influence game play is against the rules, and the creators reserve the right to delete and even ban problematic abusers. Players new to DartMUD have been advised to use a \\"disposable\\" character for their initial learning process, anticipating that they will make mistakes in their early socialization; a fresh start once the initial learning curve is past allows for community engagement with a clean reputation. = Organizations = In DartMUD, magic items are rare and characters rarely gain special abilities; consequently, more mundane objects gain greater significance. As characters accumulate wealth, they require a place to keep it. Like other LPMuds of its era, DartMUD initially had no facility for equipment storage. As available disk space and processing power increased, storage facilities were added to the game in the form of collective resources for which players could strive: Castles, Guild halls, and Inns. * Castles are the seats of power of noble houses, which are implemented as player-run feudal organizations. The leader of a noble house is established by a process of swearing fealty‚Äîto conquer a castle, an invading group must eliminate its defenders and seat one of its own members on the throne. Castles typically have extensive defenses, crafting facilities, and as many player rooms as an Inn. * Guild halls are the domains of a guild, which specializes in a specific area, led by a guild master elected from the membership. They have more modest defenses and facilities than a castle, and are located inside an established city. * Inns are located in cities, and have rooms for rent, and are regularly targets for thieves. Castles and Guilds form factions; tensions arise from wars and shifting alliances.  History and Ancestry  *1991: DartMUD is started on a Motorola 68030-based NeXT computer owned by a Dartmouth College graduate student, hence the name. *1994: Due to the original site host's departure from Dartmouth, DartMUD moves to an Intel-architecture Linux system hosted at a commercial ISP, Hawaii On Line.http://www.aloha.net/ Hawaii On Line The change from a college-based project run by volunteers to a commercially promoted service with a part-time overseer resulted in significant staff turnover. At the same time, Hawaii On Line's promotion drew a large number of Hawaiian residents as new players. Several architecture- specific optimizations in the LPMud driver and DartMUD mudlib had to be removed or re-coded, and DartMUD has been running on commodity Intel Architecture systems ever since. *1995: When Hawaii On Line stopped funding its local games, DartMUD moved to the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. *1996: When the Rose-Hulman staff member hosting DartMUD left the Institute, DartMUD moved to a UCLA graduate student's office. At this point Accursed Lands was created by five DartMUD creators and one player who had logged into the mud for the first time earlier that day. Accursed Lands initially shared the same server with DartMUD. Accursed Lands was informally referred to initially as \\"DartMUD II\\" during its development phase, but creative differences led to the dissolution of the initial Accursed Lands startup team, and development continues to this day on both DartMUD and Accursed Lands. *1997: DartMUD moved to another company where a staff member worked. *2003: DartMUD moved to the home broadband of another staff member. *2013: DartMUD moved to a VPS hosting service, finally free from personal hardware and small internet connections. DartMUD is maintained by donations from staff and players alike -- since 2004, more than half of operating expenses have been covered by player contributions using PayPal. Unlike many other MUDs which encourage player donations, DartMUD never has conveyed any in-game reward or recognition to players who donate.

A traveller with a ticket for either G1 or G2 is also able to travel within the shaded city centre area, but travel into an outer Glasgow zone (G3 to G8) requies a minimum of three zones. Tickets with three Glasgow zones are valid for travel in all Glasgow zones (G1 to G8). The city centre is served by both inner Glasgow zones, and purchasing one of these entitles the user to use the subway system in both areas. A child's zonecard with 6 zones or an adult zonecard with 13 zones, entitles the user to travel throughout all zones. A ZoneCard consists of a photocard and a paper counterpart which displays the validity period and is used for operating the barriers on Glasgow's Subway. Previously, passengers who have validated their tickets for the Subway needed to have their tickets manually checked at the ticket barriers at Glasgow Queen Street station because the barriers accept only standard-sized Subway tickets. In 2004, the Glasgow Queen Street barriers were updated so that ZoneCards did not need validation to operate them. The card can be purchased in durations of 1 week, 4 weeks, 10 weeks, and 1 year. The ZoneCard can be used with any participating transport provider within the zones that the holder has purchased. With a total of approximately 70 transport providers--across bus, rail, and ferry services--in the scheme, there are very few companies who do not accept ZoneCards. The only TOC which doesn't accept ZoneCards is TransPennine Express. Operators criticise the complexity of the zone system, which consists of 77 zones. By comparison, Transport for London's scheme consists of 9 zones despite containing 90 more underground stations than the SPT does rail stations. However, the TfL system only covers , an area slightly smaller than South Lanarkshire. In addition, the SPT bus network is far larger due to the greater size of its zone system. Revenue The revenue from the scheme is split between the participating operators (the administration costs are absorbed by SPT) based on a number of factors, such as the number of routes operated by a provider, an annual user survey, and passenger counts by SPT officials. Some operators (notably Abellio ScotRail) are guaranteed a certain percentage of the revenue regardless of these factors but more recently Avanti West Coast, LNER and CrossCountry also receive revenue from ZoneCards as their trains provide services between Glasgow and Motherwell and vice versa. Aside from the previously mentioned administration costs, the scheme is designed to be self-supporting, unlike some other tickets which are subsidised with public money to help the significant percentage of households in the region that do not have access to a car.

It stars Urmila Matondkar. The film was premiered in the March√© du Film section of the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film is a remake of the 2002 Hong Kong-Singaporean horror film The Eye directed by the Pang brothers. Its release caused controversy in India because its depiction of the protagonist seeing ghosts after receiving a corneal transplant was similar to existing fears in India surrounding corneal transplants and it was feared the film would discourage people from donating corneas or seeking corneal transplants. Plot During a solar eclipse in 1986, young Naina Shah, while traveling in the backseat of her England-based dad's car, is struck by glass from the shattered windshield during an accident, and loses her eyesight. Her parents do not survive, and she is brought up by her paternal grandmother. Years later, Naina gets a successful corneal transplant, and is able to see. She complains of vision problems, seeing hooded persons, and people dying, which a psychiatrist, Samir Patel, diagnoses as hallucinations. But when Naina reports seeing someone else in her mirror reflection, Sameer decides to investigate who the original cornea actually belonged to. This investigation will lead them to an impoverished village in New Bhuj, Gujarat, where she will find her life endangered by hostile villagers who believe that the donor of her cornea was cursed.

Narayan, Revathy Nagaswami, 1992, Discover sublime India: handbook for tourists, Page 5.Ghat definition, Cambridge dictionary. Roads passing through ghats are called Ghat Roads. Etymology The word 'Ghat' has been derived from Dravidian etymons such as Tamil/Kannada words Kaadu/Kaadu(‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æü‡ØÅ/‡≤ï‡≤æ‡≤°‡≥Å) (Forest, Side of a mountain, ridge)or Telugu katta and gattu (dam and embankment) Type of ghats in India =Mountain ghats = Western Ghats The word ghati (Hindi: ‡§ò‡§æ‡§ü‡•Ä) means valley.https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/hindi- english/%E0%A4%98%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9F%E0%A5%80 Ghati meaning], Hindi-English Collins dictionary. In Marathi, Hindi, Gujarati and Kannada, ghat is a term used to identify a difficult passage over a mountain. One such passage is the Bhor Ghat that connects the towns Khopoli and Khandala, on NH 4 about north of Mumbai. Charmadi Ghat of Karnataka is also notable. In many cases, the term is used to refer to a mountain range itself, as in the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats. 'Ghattam' in Malayalam also refers to mountain ranges when used with the name of the ranges being addressed (e.g., paschima ghattam for Western Ghats), while the passage road would be called a 'churam'. Eastern Ghats on the east coast of India and Western Ghats on the west coast of India are the largest ghats in pensular India. Western Ghats, also known as Sahyadri (Benevolent Mountains), is a mountain range covers an area of 140,000 km¬≤ in a stretch of 1,600 km parallel to the western coast of the Indian peninsula, traverse the States of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra and Gujarat. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and is one of the eight \\"hottest hot-spots\\" of biological diversity in the world. It is sometimes called the Great Escarpment of India.. It is a biodiversity hotspot that contains a large proportion of the country's flora and fauna; many of which are only found here and nowhere else in the world. According to UNESCO, Western Ghats are older than Himalayan mountains. It also influences Indian monsoon weather patterns by intercepting the rain-laden monsoon winds that sweep in from the south-west during late summer. The range runs north to south along the western edge of the Deccan Plateau, and separates the plateau from a narrow coastal plain, called Konkan, along the Arabian Sea. A total of thirty-nine properties including national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserve forests were designated as world heritage sites - twenty in Kerala, ten in Karnataka, five in Tamil Nadu and four in Maharashtra. Ghati people, literally means the people of hills or ghats (valleys), is an exonym used for the marathi people specially those from the villages in Western Ghats, often in pejorative terms.>Bombay Teachers and the Cultural Role of Cities, Page 110.Of 'ghati', 'bhaiyya' & 'yandu gundu': Mumbai has huge diversity in its pejoratives, First Post, 26 Feb 2019.Guruprasad Datar, 2018, Stereotypes, The Eastern Ghats are a discontinuous range of mountains along India's eastern coast. The Eastern Ghats run from the northern Odisha through Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu in the south passing some parts of Karnataka and in the Wayanad region of Kerala. They are eroded and cut through by four major rivers of peninsular India, viz. Godavari, Mahanadi, Krishna, and Kaveri. The mountain ranges run parallel to the Bay of Bengal. The Deccan Plateau lies to the west of the range, between the Eastern Ghats and the Western Ghats. The coastal plains, including the Coromandel Coast region, lie between the Eastern Ghats and the Bay of Bengal. The Eastern Ghats are not as high as the Western Ghats. The Eastern Ghats are older than the Western Ghats, and have a complex geologic history related to the assembly and breakup of the ancient supercontinent of Rodinia and the assembly of the Gondwana supercontinent. The Eastern Ghats are made up of charnockites, granite gneiss, khondalites, metamorphic gneisses and quartzite rock formations. The structure of the Eastern Ghats includes thrusts and strike-slip faults all along its range. Limestone, bauxite and iron ore are found in the Eastern Ghats hill ranges. =River ghats = The numerous significant ghats along the Ganges are the Varanasi ghats (the city of Varanasi has 88 ghats) and generically the \\"ghats of the Ganges\\". Most of these were constructed under the patronage of various Maratha rulers such as Ahilyabai Holkar (Queen of the Malwa Kingdom from 1767 to 1795) in the 18th century. In Madhya Pradesh in central India there are further significant ghats along the Narmada River. People who live on the steps are also called ghats. =Shmashana - the cremation ghats= A late 18th-century painting of Pune with the Shmashana ghat at the confluence of Mula and Mutha rivers in the foreground Ghats such as these are useful for both mundane purposes (such as cleaning) and religious rites (i.e. ritual bathing or ablutions); there are also specific \\"shmashana\\" or \\"cremation\\" ghats where bodies are cremated waterside, allowing ashes to be washed away by rivers; notable ones are Nigambodh Ghat and Raj Ghat in Delhi on the Yamuna, the latter of which was the cremation area for Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and numerous political leaders after him, and the Manikarnika Ghat at Varanasi on the Ganges. =Ghats as place name suffix= \\"Ghat\\" and \\"Ghata\\" is also a suffix used in several place names across the subcontinent.

For example, in George Town, Penang in Malaysia, the label \\"Ghaut\\" is used to identify the extensions of those streets which formerly ended in ghats before reclamation of the quayside (e.g., Church St Ghaut - in Malay Gat Lebuh Gereja - is the name of the extension of Church St beyond where the street used to descend to the water via a ghat). In both Penang and Singapore, there are areas named Dhoby Ghaut (dhobi meaning \\"launderer\\" or \\"laundry\\", depending on whether it refers to a person or a business). Aapravasi Ghat or The Immigration Depot is a building complex located in Port Louis on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, the first British colony to receive indentured, or contracted, labour workforce from India. From 1849 to 1923, half a million Indian indentured labourers passed through the Immigration Depot, to be transported to plantations throughout the British Empire. The large-scale migration of the laborers left an indelible mark on the societies of many former British colonies, with Indians constituting a substantial proportion of their national populations. In Mauritius alone, 68 percent of the current total population is of Indian ancestry. The Immigration Depot has thus become an important reference point in the history and cultural identity of Mauritius.

He reigned from 1224 to 1264. His original name was Zhao Yuju but later changed his name to Zhao Guicheng and then finally changed his name to Zhao Yun being elevated to a imperial son. Although he was a descendant of the Song dynasty's founder Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu) through his son Zhao Dezhao and hence a member of the imperial clan, Zhao Yun was not in line to succeed to the throne as his family had no political status. Shi Miyuan (), who was the chancellor for many years, collaborated with Empress Dowager Yang and when Emperor Ningzong eventually died in 1224, Shi, along with Empress Dowager Yang, supplanted the reigning crown prince Zhao Hong and replaced him with Zhao Yun as emperor, reigning with the era name Baoqing and the temple name Lizong. The 40-year-reign of Emperor Lizong did little to nothing to improve the Dynasty and instead sought pleasure even as the Mongols were terrorizing the borders. He died at age 59 in 1264 and was succeeded by his nephew Emperor Duzong. Early life Although related to the Song imperial family, Emperor Lizong was only distantly related as he was the 10th generation descendant of the founding Song Emperor, Emperor Taizu more than 250 years before. Emperor Lizong spent his childhood in obscurity living away from the imperial court in Shaoxing, Zhejiang as a minor official. One rainy day in his early teens, along with his younger brother Zhao Yurui, Lizong stood huddling under a bridge along with an official, Yu Tianxi, who was sent by Chancellor Shi Miyuan tasked to locate a suitable successor to the Song throne as the incumbent crown prince Zhao Xun has recently passed away at the age of 29. After discovering the true identity of this teenager, Yu quickly informed Shi Miyuan who agreed to groom Lizong to be replaced as the crown prince. It is said that Lizong was serious, studious, mostly silent, and wise before assuming the throne. When Ningzong died in 1224, Shi Miyuan told Lizong to enter the throne room and then ordered Zhao Hong, then the current crown prince into the room. Shi Miyuan subsequently declared Lizong emperor and according to history, he was wearing a white robe and the lights reflected his shadow on the throne. The result of Lizong becoming Emperor angered Zhao Hong who refused to bow until he was forced to by the palace commander. He was then sent away.  Reign  Lizong's long reign of 40 years did little to improve the predicament of the Song Empire in his time. The court of Emperor Lizong was dominated by consort clans, Yan and Jia, the eunuchs Dong Songchen and Lu Yunsheng, and his Co-Regent Empress Dowager Yang. The Emperor was uninterested in governmental affairs, and for the first decade of his rule he delegated matters into the hands of his ministers, notably Shi Miyuan, who was the de facto ruler in his absence. Many critics blamed Lizong's leadership for the eventual fall of the Song dynasty. A year after Emperor Lizong took the throne, he honored Zhu Xi with the posthumous name Duke of Hui (ÂæΩÂúãÂÖ¨).Chan 1989: 34. Hui refers to Hui-chou his ancestral place in Anhui, now Jiangxi. Lizong faced a minor rebellion led by the former crown prince Zhao Hong which was put down after two weeks; Zhao Hong himself was executed. From the winter of 1230 to the autumn of 1231, the Mongols forcibly passed through the Song Dynasty. In the region centered on the three passes of Shukou, they entered into a series of battles with the Song army. This was the second and largest armed conflict between them before the Mongol conquest of Song officially began.Èôà‰∏ñÊùæÁ≠âÔºåÁ¨¨22È°µ This forced Lizong to ally with the Mongols as they might conquer the Song. Wuzhun Shifan, a monk was summoned by Emperor Lizong in 1233. Emperor Lizong discussed with Wuzhun about Zen Buddhism, and Dharma.Faure, 43. After Shi Miyuan's death in 1233, Emperor Lizong assumed full authority briefly but again quickly abandoned the responsibility of ruling and delegated matters to his chancellor Ding Daquan in order to pursue personal enjoyment. It was said that the emperor often drank wine a lot, frequented brothels and invited prostitutes into the palace in his late years, which was vehemently opposed by his ministers.Song Shi ‚ÄúFrom middle life onward, his addiction to sensual pleasure ever grew; he neglected governing and turning powers over to treacherous ministers.‚Äù Notable events during Emperor Lizong's reign included the demise of the Jurchen-led Jin dynasty in 1234, which was obliterated by the joint forces of the Mongol Empire and the Song Dynasty. The Jurchens had fought multiple wars with the Song Empire decades before it was conquered by the Mongols and although their ruler Emperor Aizong tried to make peace with the Song Dynasty to warn them that if the Mongols conquered the Jin Dynasty and they would attack the Song next, Emperor Lizong ignored the warning. =The Start of the Mongol Invasion=  Siege of Luoyang  Once the Jin dynasty has fallen, the Song dynasty attempted to take back its northern territories originally occupied by the Jin and took back Luoyang and Kaifeng in July 1234. However, in September 1234, the Mongols counterattacked with the siege of Luoyang. The Song army holding Luoyang was short of food supplies. Additionally, the Mongols diverted the water of Yellow River into the city causing great casualties among the Song army.Songshi Jishi Ben mo(ÂÆãÂè≤Á¥Ä‰∫ãÊú¨Êú´).vol.24Palace portrait on a hanging scroll, kept in the National Palace Museum, Taipei, Taiwan. The fall of Luoyang was simply a prologue of a series of upcoming battles which lasted decades. The fall of Luoyang also began the official start of the Mongol conquest of the Song dynasty. The Mongols blamed the Song for \\"breaking the alliance\\". However, it was more of an excuse for further Mongol expeditions. Other notable events include the Song's ally Dali falling to the Mongols. Emperor Lizong met Zhao Yifu (1189‚Äì1256), who was a minister and a defender of Jiangnan. Lizong started to Yifu, \\"You have had two years of great toil, minister.\\" Yifu said \\"My memorials have all reflected Your Majesty's virtue. I have not had a hair of merit.\\" Emperor Lizong replied \\"You discussed urgent matters like preventing rebellions, imperial succession, and the drought that hit Jiangnan and Hunan.\\" Yifu then said \\"King Tang reproached himself over the six affairs. Your Majesty should determine whether in the present circumstances there is a ‚Äòsix affairs‚Äô [situation].\\" Yifu was named imperial reader-in-waiting the next day. In 1241, T√∂regene Khatun had sent an envoy to make peace proposals and discuss with Emperor Lizong. However, the Song court arrested the envoy and imprisoned him in a fortress with his suite of seventy people.Jeremiah Curtin The Mongols: A History, p.327 The envoy died, but his suite were detained until 1254. That year the Mongol army attacked to take Hejiu but failed. The Chinese freed the suite of the late envoy to show their desire for peace. The New Khan M√∂ngke concentrated all his attention on the conquest of the Song dynasty. Taking personal command late in the decade, he captured many of the fortified cities along the northern front. In October 1257 M√∂ngke set out for South China, leaving his administration to his brother, Ariq B√∂ke. Wen Tianxiang and Lu Xiufu passed the imperial examination where Emperor Lizong personally gave Wen first rank. In 1259, the Song government was forced to capitulate and cede all territories north of the Yangtze River to the Mongols. Despite this, M√∂ngke Khan was killed earlier in the year in a siege with no designated heir setting the stage for the Division of the Mongol Empire. The invasions frightened Lizong to the extent that he attempted to move the Song capital but was stopped by his Empress Xie Daoqing; she thought that if they moved, it would create chaos among the people. In 1260, Jia Sidao became chancellor who would eventually soon take control over the new emperor Zhao Qi after Lizong's death and expel his opponents like Wen Tianxiang and Li Fu. In December 1261, Lizong arranged a marriage between his adopted son Zhao Qi and the 33-year-old Quan Jiu. Quan Jiu was a grandniece of Lizong's mother (who had by then died by now) making Quan a cousin of Zhao Qi. An account in Quan's official biography stated that Lizong ordered her to enter the palace where he greeted her, \\"Your father Zhaosun died in the service of his majesty in the Baoyou reign, the very thought of which makes me grieve.\\" Quan replied \\"My father can be remembered, but even more should the plight of the masses of the Huai and Hu regions be remembered!\\" greatly impressing Lizong who said to his high-ranking officials \\"The words of this daughter of the Quan family are particularly grandiloquent. A betrothal should be arranged with the heir-apparent to permit continuation of the ritual line.\\" Internal-combustion rocket propulsion is mentioned in a reference to 1264, recording that the \\"ground-rat\\", a type of firework, had frightened the Empress-Mother Gongsheng at a feast held in her honor by her son Emperor Lizong. Also in 1264, Emperor Lizong died sonless (his sons died prematurely) from a illness and was succeeded by his adopted son and biological nephew, Zhao Qi, known as Emperor Duzong after his death. One of his daughters married a descendant of Zhu Xi. Calligraphy Quatrain on Late Spring, by Emperor Lizong. Emperor Lizong was a skilled poet and calligrapher. The Metropolitan Museum reports, \\"Lizong was the finest calligrapher among the Song emperors who came after Gaozong (r. 1127‚Äì62).\\" Lizong developed his own unique calligraphic style which was easily recognizable as it showed sharp and rapid brush strokes. The Metropolitan Museum says, \\"Lizong developed his own unique manner, which was distinguished by angular brushstrokes with straight rapid brush movements‚Äîin contrast to the slower, more rounded brushstrokes of Gaozong‚Äîand by his preference for Tang, rather than Jin, dynasty models.\\" Emperor Lizong also expresses his feelings in his poems as shown in his poem 'Quatrain on Late Spring' which reads: :How spring makes me sad! :Timidly I bear the passing of spring. :The young lady has no feeling for me, :She treats my love merely as that of a waning spring. In this poem, it is clearly established that Emperor Lizong laments old age.

It was introduced at the end of the 1957 racing season in response to rule changes that enforced a maximum engine displacement of 3 liters for the 24 Hours of Le Mans and World Sports Car Championship races. The 250 TR was closely related to earlier Ferrari sports cars, sharing many key components with other 250 models and the 500 TR. The 250 TR achieved many racing successes, with variations winning 10 World Sports Car Championship races including the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1958, 1960, and 1961, the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1958, 1959 and 1961, the Targa Florio in 1958, the 1000 Km Buenos Aires in 1958 and 1960 and the Pescara 4 Hours in 1961. These results led to World Sports Car Championship constructor's titles for Ferrari in 1958, 1960 and 1961.  Design and development  The 250 Testa Rossa was initially developed to compete in the 1957 World Sports Car Championship racing season, in response to rule changes planned for the upcoming 1958 season that would enforce a maximum engine displacement of 3 liters. The objective was to improve on the existing 4-cylinder 2.0L 500 TR/500 TRC Testa Rossa by integrating the more powerful Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 as used in 250 GT series. Along with the new engine, Ferrari improved the existing Testa Rossa chassis and bodywork. As with other Ferrari racing cars, Enzo Ferrari demanded absolute reliability from all components, resulting in a somewhat conservative design approach that aimed for endurance racing success through durability rather than overall speed. Carlo Chiti was the chief designer during 250 TR development and his continual experimentation counterbalanced Mr. Ferrari's conservatism and led to the many revisions that kept the car competitive through 1962. Other Ferrari engineers had major contributions to the 250 TR, notably Giotto Bizzarrini, who helped with aerodynamic improvements for the 1961 season, and Andrea Fraschetti, who helped developed the first 250 TR prototype before his 1957 death during a test drive. The 250 TR was raced and continually developed by Scuderia Ferrari from 1957 through 1962. In total, 33 250 TRs of all types were built between 1957 and 1962. Included in this total are 19 \\"customer versions\\" of the 250 TR sold to independent racing teams, replacing the 500 TRC for this market. All customer cars had left hand drive Scaglietti \\"pontoon fender\\" bodies and live rear axles. They did not benefit from the continual improvements to Scuderia Ferrari cars, although many independent teams modified their 250 TRs or purchased ex-Scuderia Ferrari cars in order to stay competitive. = Engine and drivetrain = 250 Testa Rossa Tipo 128 V-12 Engine The 250 Testa Rossa engine was based on Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 used in 250 GT road and racing cars. Carlo Chiti and other Ferrari engineers made several modifications to increase the performance of this already proven engine. The starting point was a 1953-style cylinder block with an overall capacity of 2953 cc, a 73mm bore and 58.8 mm stroke. Six two-barrel Weber 38 DCN carburetors fed the engine, increased from the 3 carburetors typical for 250 GT engines. The cylinder heads used single overhead cams, 2 valves per cylinder and helical double-coil valve springs (a first for Ferrari). The helical valve springs were much smaller than previously used torsion springs, allowing the cylinder heads to be strengthened and secured with 24 studs rather than 18 in previous 250 engines. This increased the overall reliability of the engine by improving head gasket sealing. One spark plug was used per cylinder and the position was changed from earlier 250 designs, now located outside the engine vee between exhaust ports. This allowed for a better spark position and more efficient combustion. Piston connecting rods were now machined from steel billet, rather than forged, which resulted in more stress-resistance at higher RPMs. The cam covers were painted bright red, the source of the name \\"Testa Rossa\\" (literally, \\"Red Head\\"). This tradition and name originated with the 500 TR. The resulting engine was designated Tipo 128 and generated at 7000 rpm. The power/displacement ratio of 100 hp/liter was a particular point of pride for Ferrari, as it demonstrated how Ferrari's engineering prowess could create a competitive engine even under rules restricting displacement. The engineering team improved a well understood, proven design by incorporating new technology and strengthening known weak points. They created an exceptionally durable engine, a massive benefit in endurance racing. Other Ferrari racing cars (250 GTO, 250 P) achieved racing success with the same basic engine well into the 1960s, years after the 250 TR chassis was obsolete. 1957-1958 250 TRs used a 4-speed transmission, followed by a 5-speed transmission in 1959. Customer cars were equipped with a 250 GT-style transmission positioned directly behind the engine, while Scuderia Ferrari team cars sometimes used rear-mounted transaxles for better weight distribution. 1957 - 1958 factory team car. Orange arrow: shifter shaft to transaxle. Blue arrow: Leaf spring for de Dion suspension. = Chassis, brakes and suspension = The 250 Testa Rossa used a tubular steel spaceframe chassis, similar to that used in the 500 TR. Compared to the 500 TR, the wheelbase was extended by 10 cm to 2.35 meters. The chassis gained a reputation for durability, as it was designed according to Enzo Ferrari's desire for absolute reliability even at the expense of excess weight. All 250 TRs used independent front suspension with coil springs. All customer cars had live rear axles. Pre-1960 factory team cars used either live or de Dion rear axles while the 1960 250 TRI60 and 1961 250 TRI61 used independent rear suspension. 1957 and 1958 250 TRs were equipped with drum brakes on all four wheels. Enzo Ferrari insisted on the use of drum brakes in the early 250 TRs as he believed they were more reliable and predictable in how they faded compared to more powerful but relatively new disc brakes. Drum brakes were unpopular with drivers as they required tremendous physical exertion to operate, due to lack of servo assist and the extremely hard, long- lasting pads used for endurance races. Despite the extensive air cooling used in the 1958 \\"pontoon fender\\"-bodied cars, drum brakes were still subject to heat-induced fade. They were finally replaced with Dunlop disc brakes in all Scuderia Ferrari cars for the 1959 race season. = Bodywork and interior = All 250 TRs had 2-seater spider bodies, as did the earlier 4-cylinder Testa Rossas. At the time, this was considered the lightest and most aerodynamic configuration for a racing sports car. The first 250 Testa Rossa prototype (chassis number 0666TR) debuted at the 1957 N√ºrburgring 1000km. This hastily prepared prototype was based on a 290 MM chassis and had conventional bodywork by Scaglietti very similar to that of the 4-cylinder 500 TR, except for a large hood bulge. 1958 250 TR with \\"pontoon fender\\" Scaglietti body. The channels for front brake cooling are clearly visible Interior of 1958 250 TR. For the 1958 250 TR, new bodywork was developed in collaboration between Scaglietti and Chiti with several innovations on the previous 4-cylinder Testa Rossa body. Instead of the conventional fully enclosed front end, the new body had a distinctive cut-away nose reminiscent of a Formula 1 car. The protuberant central air intake was now flanked by deep channels and the headlights were set into nacelle- or pontoon-like fenders that enveloped each front wheel. The purpose of this design was to funnel cooling air inwards towards the brake drums, mitigating the persistent problem of heat-related fade. The lower body was recessed inwards behind the front wheels in order to vent heat from the brakes and exhaust. The front hood was topped with a large bulge and air intake (forward facing on some cars, reverse facing on others) to provide clearance for the vertically oriented carburetors. The rear bodywork was more conventional, including a tapered fairing behind the driver's head and two small brake lights set into vertical fins. The distinctive cutaway-nose bodywork of the 1958 cars became the most iconic 250 TR style and was used on all cars sold new to private customers. This resulted in the colloquial name for early Scaglietti-bodied 250 TRs: \\"pontoon fender.\\" Despite their radical appearance, racing and test runs soon showed that this design generated a significant amount of aerodynamic drag and high speed instability. This was especially noticeable when competing on high speed courses such as the Circuit de la Sarthe against more aerodynamic cars such as the Maserati Tipo 61 and Jaguar D-Type. As a result, the Scaglietti bodywork was soon revised and a wide variety of alternative styles were created from 1958 through 1961. Even during 1958, some Scuderia Ferrari cars were equipped with more conventional bodies in the style of the 1957 prototype. The 250 TR's open interior was simple and utilitarian, lacking the luxury trimmings found in Ferrari GT cars. The instrumentation and controls were completely focused around the driver. Like other 1950s and 1960s Ferrari sports cars, 250 TRs were equipped with an open gated shifter and a Nardi wooden steering wheel. = Variants and further development = The 250 TR was subject to continual iteration and refinement from 1957 to 1961, resulting in numerous differences between individual cars that may or may not coincide with different chassis production dates. As was common with Ferrari racing cars of the 1950s and 1960s, 250 TRs were frequently modified and updated by the Ferrari factory and/or private owners. Bodywork was often changed to improve performance or to repair crash damage. Ferrari historians track these changes with a numbering suffix based on year of production (such as 250 TR61 for a 1961-style car) as well as descriptors such as \\"Spider Fantuzzi\\" to denote cars with bodies fabricated by Fantuzzi. Despite this historiographical systematization, the low-production, hand-built nature of these cars and their use and modification in period mean that differences are most thoroughly explained in the context of an individual chassis' history.  1959: TR59  For the 1959 season, the 250 TR body design was lightly revised by Pinin Farina, with fabrication of the bodies handled by Fantuzzi. The cutaway nose with pontoon fenders was gone, replaced by a more aerodynamic design that still incorporated many ventilation grilles and air inlets. The 1959 250 TR was the first Ferrari sports car to use disc brakes (manufactured by Dunlop). Disc brakes are much less susceptible to heat build-up and fade than drum brakes, so the extra air cooling provided by the 1958 Scaglietti body was no longer necessary. A 5-speed transmission mounted directly behind the engine was also introduced in 1959.  1960: TR60 and TRI60  1959 250 TR59/60 Spider Fantuzzi, showing the tall windshield used on 1960 cars Dry sump lubrication systems became standard equipment for all 250 TRs in 1960. This allowed the engine to sit lower in the chassis, lowering the car's center of mass for improved handling and enabling a lower, more aerodynamic front profile. Rear independent suspension was introduced to the 250 TR in 1960. The car equipped with independent suspension was designated the 250 TRI60 (chassis 0780TR) and throughout the season raced alongside the 250 TR60 equipped with a conventional de Dion rear axle. The body of the 250 TR again changed for the 1960 season, primarily due to new regulations requiring a windshield with a vertical height of 25 cm. The new, larger windshield was immediately disliked by drivers, as it was difficult to see over, the plexiglass material could not be effectively cleared by windshield wipers, and the much larger surface area increased drag. The excess drag resulted in a top speed of down the Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans. In comparison, during the same race Masten Gregory's Maserati Tipo 61 reached approximately . 1959 cars that were updated to 1960 specification (minus independent rear suspension) are often designated as 250 TR59/60.  1961: TRI61  1961 250 TRI61 Spider Fantuzzi All 1961 250 Testa Rossas were designated 250 TRI61 as independent rear suspension was now standard. Due to high drag and visibility problems with the TR60 body style, Ferrari engineers including Giotto Bizzarrini and Carlo Chiti were tasked with completely re-designing the 250 TR bodywork for the 1961 racing season. As a result, the new Fantuzzi-built TRI61 body incorporated a number of dramatic changes, informed by new aerodynamic theories and wind-tunnel testing. The windshield now had a more gradual slope and wrapped around both sides of the cockpit to meet the rear bodywork. Instead of the rounded tail with fairing for the driver's head, the TRI61 had a very high rear body that met the trailing edge of the side windows and tapered to a truncated, slightly concave Kamm tail. This bodystyle was called an \\"open coupe\\" and was very similar to bodies used on mid-engined Ferrari sports racers such as the 1961 246 SP. The front air inlet was now split into two openings, introducing the distinctive \\"sharknose\\" or \\"nostril\\" style that was also used on other Ferrari sports racing cars such as the 246 SP and the 156 Formula 1 car. This front end styling had first appeared on a trio of Maserati 250Fs that Fantuzzi re-bodied in 1958 for racer Ross Jensen and team owner Temple Buell (son of the architect with the same name). Fantuzzi's suggestion that the twin intakes would improve air penetration was confirmed by Chiti's wind tunnel testing, leading to the adoption of this style throughout Ferrari's 1961 racing cars. During testing of the 250 TRI61, a full-width angled \\"deflector\\" panel was installed along the top edge of the rear bodywork. This was initially installed to prevent exhaust fumes from entering the cockpit under deceleration. After testing the prototype with the deflector, driver Richie Ginther commented that high-speed stability seemed to improve with only a slight reduction in top speed, leading to the inclusion of this feature on all 1961 bodies. The Ferrari engineers had in effect created a rear spoiler, well before engineers understood the aerodynamic theory behind them and integrated them into many car designs.  1962: 330 TRI/LM  1962 Ferrari 330 TRI/LM For the 1962 season, Ferrari developed the final iteration of the front-engined Testa Rossa, the 330 TRI/LM (LM standing for Le Mans). The biggest change from the 250 TR was a Tipo 163 4.0 Liter Colombo V12 developed from the engine of the 400 Superamerica, further improved with Testa Rossa cylinder heads and other modifications seen on 250 TR engines. This engine produced at 7500 rpm, significantly more power than the 250-series 3.0L unit. This engine design would be used again in the 1964 330 P. The single 330 TRI/LM (chassis number 0808) was built from a damaged 250 TRI60 (chassis 0780TR). The original chassis was lengthened and a TRI61-style spider body by Fantuzzi was fitted. At the 1962 24 Hours of Le Mans, this car was driven by Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill and became the last front-engine car to win an overall victory at Le Mans.  Racing history  Abate/Maglioli, driving for Scuderia Serenissima at the 1963 N√ºrburgring 1000km. L√©opoldville, with Paul Fr√®re driving The 250 Testa Rossa was raced successfully throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s. Independent teams raced the 250 TR alongside Scuderia Ferrari cars from 1958 on, although the most developed versions of the car were restricted to factory-sanctioned teams only. 250 TRs were extremely competitive during this time, winning 10 World Sportscar Championship races including the 1958, 1960, and 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 1958, 1959 and 1961 12 Hours of Sebring, the 1958 Targa Florio, the 1958 and 1960 1000 km Buenos Aires and the 1961 4 hours of Pescara. Notable drivers included Phil Hill, Olivier Gendebien, Luigi Musso, Peter Collins, Dan Gurney, Wolfgang von Trips and Mike Hawthorne, among others. The excellent results of 250 TRs and Scuderia Ferrari's skilled drivers earned Ferrari the 1958, 1960 and 1961 Constructor's World Sportscar Championship titles. The Aston Martin DBR1 and the Porsche 718 were the 250 TR's closest competitors during this time. Stirling Moss drove a DBR1 to win first place against strong Ferrari opposition at the 1958 1000km N√ºrburgring, and DBR1s would go on to win over 250 TRs at the 1959 Le Mans, N√ºrburgring, and Tourist Trophy races, depriving Ferrari of the Constructor's World Championship in 1959.  Influence  The Tipo 128 Colombo-designed 3.0L V12 developed for the 250 Testa Rossa would continue to be used in Ferrari sports racing cars through the early 1960s. The 250 GTO, 250 P and 250 LM achieved racing success with this engine. Experimentation on 250 TR body styles from 1957 through 1962 provided Ferrari engineers with valuable experience in developing both low-drag and stability- promoting aerodynamic bodywork. The 250 GTO, SP sports racers, and 250/275/330 P were the immediate beneficiaries of this knowledge. Ferrari named the 1984-1991 Testarossa road car as a homage to the 500 TR and 250 TR. In contrast to the front-engine V12-powered 250 TR, the Testarossa is a mid- engine design using a flat-12 engine and was designed as a road-going sports car, rather than a racer.  Collectibility  The 250 Testa Rossa is one of the most valuable vintage Ferraris (and therefore one of the most valuable cars of any type), due to their low production (33 total including all 250 TR variants), racing success and historical influence. The 250 GTO is generally considered to have a greater monetary value, although true market values are difficult to determine due to how seldom either model is sold at auction. 250 TRs are often seen at prestigious auto shows such as the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance and the Goodwood Festival of Speed. A 1957 250 TR (chassis 0714TR) sold for ‚Ç¨9,020,000 at RM Sotheby's 2009 Maranello auction. The 1957 250 TR prototype (chassis 0666TR) sold for $16.39 million at the 2011 Gooding & Co Pebble Beach auction. 250 TR chassis 0704 reportedly sold privately in 2014 for $39.8 million. Fashion designer Ralph Lauren's extensive auto collection contains two 250 TRs, a 1958 Scaglietti-bodied car (chassis 0734TR) and a 1961 250 TR/61 Spider Fantuzzi (chassis 0792TR). The value, performance and historical significance ascribed to the 250 TR have motivated many individuals and companies to create reproduction automobiles. Sold as a \\"replica\\", \\"recreation\\" or \\"reproduction\\", these can vary widely in historical accuracy and sophistication, sometimes using Ferrari engines and chassis or simply attempting to replicate the body style of the original with unrelated mechanical underpinnings. Some of these reproductions have been unscrupulously represented as original, factory-built 250 TRs. As 250 TR values rose, some extremely damaged or destroyed 250 TRs were reconstructed using varying amounts of newly fabricated or non-original components. In at least one instance, this has resulted in a case of disputed identity, whereby multiple reconstructed or reproduced cars lay claim to a particular factory chassis number.

This is opposed by traditional neuroscience, which investigates the brain's behavior by looking at patterns of neurons and the surrounding chemistry, and which assumes that any quantum effects will not be significant at this scale. The entire field of quantum consciousness is often criticized as pseudoscience, as detailed on the main article thereof. This specific theory of quantum consciousness was developed by neuroscientist Karl Pribram initially in collaboration with physicist David Bohm building on the initial theories of Holograms originally formulated by Dennis Gabor. It describes human cognition by modeling the brain as a holographic storage network. Pribram suggests these processes involve electric oscillations in the brain's fine-fibered dendritic webs, which are different from the more commonly known action potentials involving axons and synapses. These oscillations are waves and create wave interference patterns in which memory is encoded naturally, and the Wave function may be analyzed by a Fourier transform. Gabor, Pribram and others noted the similarities between these brain processes and the storage of information in a hologram, which can also be analyzed with a Fourier transform. In a hologram, any part of the hologram with sufficient size contains the whole of the stored information. In this theory, a piece of a long-term memory is similarly distributed over a dendritic arbor so that each part of the dendritic network contains all the information stored over the entire network. This model allows for important aspects of human consciousness, including the fast associative memory that allows for connections between different pieces of stored information and the non- locality of memory storage (a specific memory is not stored in a specific location, i.e. a certain cluster of neurons). Origins and development In 1946 Dennis Gabor invented the hologram mathematically, describing a system where an image can be reconstructed through information that is stored throughout the hologram. He demonstrated that the information pattern of a three-dimensional object can be encoded in a beam of light, which is more-or- less two-dimensional. Gabor also developed a mathematical model for demonstrating a holographic associative memory. One of Gabor's colleagues, Pieter Jacobus Van Heerden, also developed a related holographic mathematical memory model in 1963. This model contained the key aspect of non-locality, which became important years later when, in 1967, experiments by both Braitenberg and Kirschfield showed that exact localization of memory in the brain was false. Karl Pribram had worked with psychologist Karl Lashley on Lashley's engram experiments, which used lesions to determine the exact location of specific memories in primate brains. Lashley made small lesions in the brains and found that these had little effect on memory. On the other hand, Pribram removed large areas of cortex, leading to multiple serious deficits in memory and cognitive function. Memories were not stored in a single neuron or exact location, but were spread over the entirety of a neural network. Lashley suggested that brain interference patterns could play a role in perception, but was unsure how such patterns might be generated in the brain or how they would lead to brain function. Several years later an article by neurophysiologist John Eccles described how a wave could be generated at the branching ends of pre-synaptic axons. Multiple of these waves could create interference patterns. Soon after, Emmett Leith was successful in storing visual images through the interference patterns of laser beams, inspired by Gabor's previous use of Fourier transformations to store information within a hologram.Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks (1965). Photography by Laser. Scientific American Volume 212, Issue 6, June 1, 1965 After studying the work of Eccles and that of Leith, Pribram put forward the hypothesis that memory might take the form of interference patterns that resemble laser-produced holograms.K. Pribram (1969). The Neurophysiology of Remembering. American Volume 220, Issue 1, January 1, 1969 Physicist David Bohm presented his ideas of holomovement and implicate and explicate order. Pribram became aware of Bohm's work in 1975The implicate brain by Karl H. Pribram, karlhpribram.com and realized that, since a hologram could store information within patterns of interference and then recreate that information when activated, it could serve as a strong metaphor for brain function. Pribram was further encouraged in this line of speculation by the fact that neurophysiologists Russell and Karen DeValoisDeValois and DeValois, 1980 together established \\"the spatial frequency encoding displayed by cells of the visual cortex was best described as a Fourier transform of the input pattern.\\"\\"Pribram, 1987\\" Theory overview =The hologram and holonomy= Diagram of one possible hologram setup. A main characteristic of a hologram is that every part of the stored information is distributed over the entire hologram. Both processes of storage and retrieval are carried out in a way described by Fourier transformation equations. As long as a part of the hologram is large enough to contain the interference pattern, that part can recreate the entirety of the stored image, but the image may have unwanted changes, called noise. An analogy to this is the broadcasting region of a radio antenna. In each smaller individual location within the entire area it is possible to access every channel, similar to how the entirety of the information of a hologram is contained within a part. Another analogy of a hologram is the way sunlight illuminates objects in the visual field of an observer. It doesn't matter how narrow the beam of sunlight is. The beam always contains all the information of the object, and when conjugated by a lens of a camera or the eyeball, produces the same full three-dimensional image. The Fourier transform formula converts spatial forms to spatial wave frequencies and vice versa, as all objects are in essence vibratory structures. Different types of lenses, acting similarly to optic lenses, can alter the frequency nature of information that is transferred. This non-locality of information storage within the hologram is crucial, because even if most parts are damaged, the entirety will be contained within even a single remaining part of sufficient size. Pribram and others noted the similarities between an optical hologram and memory storage in the human brain. According to the holonomic brain theory, memories are stored within certain general regions, but stored non-locally within those regions. This allows the brain to maintain function and memory even when it is damaged. It is only when there exist no parts big enough to contain the whole that the memory is lost. This can also explain why some children retain normal intelligence when large portions of their brain‚Äîin some cases, half‚Äîare removed. It can also explain why memory is not lost when the brain is sliced in different cross-sections.[5] A single hologram can store 3D information in a 2D way. Such properties may explain some of the brain's abilities, including the ability to recognize objects at different angles and sizes than in the original stored memory. Pribram proposed that neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex. It is important to note the difference between the idea of a holonomic brain and a holographic one. Pribram does not suggest that the brain functions as a single hologram. Rather, the waves within smaller neural networks create localized holograms within the larger workings of the brain. This patch holography is called holonomy or windowed Fourier transformations. A holographic model can also account for other features of memory that more traditional models cannot. The Hopfield memory model has an early memory saturation point before which memory retrieval drastically slows and becomes unreliable. On the other hand, holographic memory models have much larger theoretical storage capacities. Holographic models can also demonstrate associative memory, store complex connections between different concepts, and resemble forgetting through \\"lossy storage.\\" =The synaptodendritic web= A Few of the Various Types of Synapses In classic brain theory the summation of electrical inputs to the dendrites and soma (cell body) of a neuron either inhibit the neuron or excite it and set off an action potential down the axon to where it synapses with the next neuron. However, this fails to account for different varieties of synapses beyond the traditional axodendritic (axon to dendrite). There is evidence for the existence of other kinds of synapses, including serial synapses and those between dendrites and soma and between different dendrites. Many synaptic locations are functionally bipolar, meaning they can both send and receive impulses from each neuron, distributing input and output over the entire group of dendrites. Processes in this dendritic arbor, the network of teledendrons and dendrites, occur due to the oscillations of polarizations in the membrane of the fine-fibered dendrites, not due to the propagated nerve impulses associated with action potentials. Pribram posits that the length of the delay of an input signal in the dendritic arbor before it travels down the axon is related to mental awareness. The shorter the delay the more unconscious the action, while a longer delay indicates a longer period of awareness. A study by David Alkon showed that after unconscious Pavlovian conditioning there was a proportionally greater reduction in the volume of the dendritic arbor, akin to synaptic elimination when experience increases the automaticity of an action. Pribram and others theorize that, while unconscious behavior is mediated by impulses through nerve circuits, conscious behavior arises from microprocesses in the dendritic arbor. At the same time, the dendritic network is extremely complex, able to receive 100,000 to 200,000 inputs in a single tree, due to the large amount of branching and the many dendritic spines protruding from the branches. Furthermore, synaptic hyperpolarization and depolarization remains somewhat isolated due to the resistance from the narrow dendritic spine stalk, allowing a polarization to spread without much interruption to the other spines. This spread is further aided intracellularly by the microtubules and extracellularly by glial cells. These polarizations act as waves in the synaptodendritic network, and the existence of multiple waves at once gives rise to interference patterns. =Deep and surface structure of memory= Pribram suggests that there are two layers of cortical processing: a surface structure of separated and localized neural circuits and a deep structure of the dendritic arborization that binds the surface structure together. The deep structure contains distributed memory, while the surface structure acts as the retrieval mechanism. Binding occurs through the temporal synchronization of the oscillating polarizations in the synaptodendritic web. It had been thought that binding only occurred when there was no phase lead or lag present, but a study by Saul and Humphrey found that cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus do in fact produce these. Here phase lead and lag act to enhance sensory discrimination, acting as a frame to capture important features. These filters are also similar to the lenses necessary for holographic functioning. Recent studies While Pribram originally developed the holonomic brain theory as an analogy for certain brain processes, several papers (including some more recent ones by Pribram himself) have proposed that the similarity between hologram and certain brain functions is more than just metaphorical, but actually structural. Others still maintain that the relationship is only analogical. Several studies have shown that the same series of operations used in holographic memory models are performed in certain processes concerning temporal memory and optomotor responses. This indicates at least the possibility of the existence of neurological structures with certain holonomic properties. Other studies have demonstrated the possibility that biophoton emission (biological electrical signals that are converted to weak electromagnetic waves in the visible range) may be a necessary condition for the electric activity in the brain to store holographic images. These may play a role in cell communication and certain brain processes including sleep, but further studies are needed to strengthen current ones. Other studies have shown the correlation between more advanced cognitive function and homeothermy. Taking holographic brain models into account, this temperature regulation would reduce distortion of the signal waves, an important condition for holographic systems. Criticism and alternative models Pribram's holonomic model of brain function did not receive widespread attention at the time, but other quantum models have been developed since, including brain dynamics by Jibu & Yasue and Vitiello's dissipative quantum brain dynamics. Though not directly related to the holonomic model, they continue to move beyond approaches based solely in classic brain theory. =Correlograph= In 1969 scientists D. Wilshaw, O. P. Buneman and H. Longuet-Higgins proposed an alternative, non-holographic model that fulfilled many of the same requirements as Gabor's original holographic model. The Gabor model did not explain how the brain could use Fourier analysis on incoming signals or how it would deal with the low signal-noise ratio in reconstructed memories. Longuet-Higgin's correlograph model built on the idea that any system could perform the same functions as a Fourier holograph if it could correlate pairs of patterns. It uses minute pinholes that do not produce diffraction patterns to create a similar reconstruction as that in Fourier holography. Like a hologram, a discrete correlograph can recognize displaced patterns and store information in a parallel and non-local way so it usually will not be destroyed by localized damage. They then expanded the model beyond the correlograph to an associative net where the points become parallel lines arranged in a grid. Horizontal lines represent axons of input neurons while vertical lines represent output neurons. Each intersection represents a modifiable synapse. Though this cannot recognize displaced patterns, it has a greater potential storage capacity. This was not necessarily meant to show how the brain is organized, but instead to show the possibility of improving on Gabor's original model. P. Van Heerden countered this model by demonstrating mathematically that the signal-noise ratio of a hologram could reach 50% of ideal. He also used a model with a 2D neural hologram network for fast searching imposed upon a 3D network for large storage capacity. A key quality of this model was its flexibility to change the orientation and fix distortions of stored information, which is important for our ability to recognize an object as the same entity from different angles and positions, something the correlograph and association network models lack. Applications Holographic models of memory and consciousness may be related to several brain disorders involving disunity of sensory input within a unified consciousness, including Charles Bonnet Syndrome, Disjunctive Agnosia, and Schizophrenia. Charles Bonnet Syndrome patients experience two vastly different worlds within one consciousness.G.G. Globus; C.P. O‚ÄôCarroll, \\"Nonlocal neurology: Beyond localization to holonomy,\\" Irvine, April 1, 2010. They see the world that psychologically normal people perceive, but also a simplified world riddled with Pseudohallucination. These patients can differentiate these two worlds easily. Since dynamic core and global workspace theories insist that a distinct area of the brain is responsible for consciousness, the only way a patient would perceive two worlds was if this dynamic core and global workspace were split. But such does not explain how different content can be perceived within one single consciousness since these theories assume that each dynamic core or global workspace creates a single coherent reality. The primary symptom of Disjunctive Agnosia is an inconsistency of sensory information within a unified consciousness. They may see one thing, but hear something entirely incompatible with that image. Schizophrenics often report experiencing thoughts that do not seem to originate from themselves, as if the idea was inserted exogenously. The individual feels no control over certain thoughts existing within their consciousness.

POL) La Douleur (War: A Memoir) is a collection of six texts by Marguerite Duras published in 1985. Two texts are invented: L'ortie bris√©e and Aur√©lia Paris. The remaining four texts are based on lived experience. In La Douleur, her husband becomes Robert L. and others also retain the names used as resistants. Monsieur X. dit ici Pierre Rabier, recounts her association with the man who arrested her husband (and his name is changed to protect his wife and child). In Albert des Capitales and Ter le milicien, Duras becomes Th√©r√®se and these are accounts of the immediate aftermath of Paris being liberated, where those who sold the Jews to the Gestapo, and those who served in the Vichy militia were tried by resistance groups. In Albert des Capitales, Th√©r√®se (Duras) extorts a confession under torture of man who sold Jews to the Gestapo. Her colleagues show their disapproval and rather than the expected summary execution, she asks D. to let him walk away. Introducing the text La Douleur, she says she had forgotten ever writing the diaryin which she recorded her account of the waiting for, and the return of her husband, Robert Antelme (a resistant taken 1 June 1944, found at Dachau, and returned to France moribund by fellow resistance workers Denys Mascolo and Fran√ßois Mitterrand). The diary would seem to also have included an earlier text about Monsieur X, and rewritten to describe a man who as a functionary couldn't stand to see her not putting on flesh when he wanted her to, but could stand making arrests and sending people to their deaths (\\"Il supporte d'arr√™ter, d'envoyer √† la mort, mais √ßa, il ne le supporte pas, que je ne grossisse pas quand il le veut\\".) In writing about X she says: \\"I find it extremely difficult to describe his essential stupidity.\\" (J'ai beaucoup de mal √† lui d√©crire son imb√©cillit√© essentielle.)  Critical reception  Writing of the translation (The War: A Memoir), Hilary Thayer Hamann calls it \\"A harsh tale of war but an unforgettable read\\". Elise Noetinger writes \\"This book is not a book. It is not a song. Not a poem. Nor thoughts. But tears, pain, crying, despair that one cannot stop nor reason with\\" However, Florence de Chalonge (2016) argues that much of the text is rewritten in the 1980s, with considerable additions and deletions, and is critical of the fact that Robert Antelme appears only under his resistance name. She sees the work as being a rewrite of history under the guise of memoir. She summarises the woman of the first four texts as: \\"the wife mad with pain in her waiting (La Douleur), the prosecution witness in a case against a collaborator too well known and too frequently seen (Monsieur X. dit Pierre Rabier), the vengeful torturer (Albert des Capitales) and the woman who finally desires to make love with Ter (Ter le milicien) (these) are the many shimmering faces of a Frenchwoman under the occupation\\". Chalonge considers the text to not be true to the original diaries since much of the anti-Gaullist component has been removed, yet what remains leaves little doubt about Duras' anti-Gaullism: \\"De Gaulle a dit cette phrase criminelle: Les jours des pleurs sont pass√©s. Les jours de gloire sont revenus. Nous ne pardonnerons jamais\\" (De Gaulle has said this criminal phrase... We will never pardon him.) \\"De Gaulle decreed a day of national mourning for Roosevelt, but there is no national day of mourning for the deported\\". And then there are the descriptions of the officers at the Centre d'Orsay where prisoners, deported Jews, resistants and the forced labourers of the STO are returning and being processed: these officers are dressed immaculately; they are members of the aristocracy; they are members of the right; it is their duty to reduce the women forced labourers of the STO to tears and shame; and when telling Duras to leave, she is \\"ma petite\\".

Because of his high self-regard and his eccentric subject matter and delivery, Pratt was often subjected to mockery, sometimes of a cruel nature. On one occasion during the U.S. Civil War, he was lecturing to a regiment of Union army troops, who slipped forged correspondence from Confederate president Jefferson Davis in his pockets. Pratt was arrested on charge of being a spy, sentenced to death in a mock trial, blindfolded, and \\"shot\\" by a dozen riflemen using blank cartridges.Chelsea Telegraph and Pioneer, June 7, 1862, pg. 2, col. 6. =Debates= Pratt periodically challenged the intellects of his day to debates.

The president, busy with the duties of his office, did not understand what he had received and returned the papers to Pratt via a White House staffer, with instructions to receive no further papers. Pratt felt this insult sorely, as he, in spite of his regular campaigning to himself fill Lincoln's office, considered himself one of the president's most hard-working supporters. The newspapers from Washington reported the encounter in the most unflattering terms, saying that \\"a crazy man had got into the White House, had harrangued the President, and had endeavored to convince that functionary that he (the crazy man) had been elected President in 1856.‚Ä¶ [Guards] seized the intruder and bore him from the sight of the offended Executive.\\"\\"Pratt Versus Lincoln: The Difficulty between Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Daniel Pratt, Jr.: Pratt's Account of the Affair\\" Brooklyn Eagle March 31, 1864 In 1867, the students of Trinity College in Connecticut, in response to one of Pratt's speeches (which the papers described as \\"a highly polished, scholarly affair, abounding in flowers of rhetoric and striking similes\\"), unanimously nominated Pratt to run for the United States presidency.

He not only spent large sums in the acquisition of his library, but stole original documents from the archives of Athens and other cities of Greece. Being detected, he fled in order to escape punishment, but returned when Athenion (or Aristion), a bitter opponent of the Romans, had made himself tyrant of the city with the aid of Mithradates. Athenion sent him with some troops to Delos, to plunder the treasures of the temple, but he showed little military capacity. He was surprised by the Romans under the command of Orobius (or Orbius), and only saved his life by flight.Athenaeus, v. He died a little later, probably in 84 BC. Library Apellicon's chief pursuit was the collection of rare and important books. He purchased from the family of Neleus of Scepsis in the Troad manuscripts of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus (including their libraries), which had been given to Neleus by Theophrastus himself, whose pupil Neleus had been. They had been concealed in a cellar to prevent their falling into the hands of the book-collecting princes of Pergamon, and were in a very dilapidated condition. Apellicon was a lover of books rather than a philosopher; trying to restore the damaged copies he made new ones, filling up the lacunae incorrectly, and published them full of mistakes. In 84 Sulla removed Apellicon's library to Rome. cites Strabo, xiii.; Plutarch, Sulla, 26 Here the manuscripts were handed over to the grammarian Tyrannion of Amisus, who took copies of them, on the basis of which the peripatetic philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes prepared an edition of Aristotle's works. Apellicon of Teos was a very rich individual who had bought up the library of Aristotle amongst many other books when he was a Peripatetic philosopher ‚Äî other sources inform us that he was a mint magistrate under Athenion, tyrant of Athens. Apellicon, furthermore, secretly acquired ‚Äî that is, stole ‚Äî the original documents from the Athenian Metroon, the building that housed the city‚Äôs public documents. Particularly significant in this passage is the precedence given to Aristotle‚Äôs books, one that eclipses other writing and documents acquired by the Peripatetic. Considering that Apellicon appears to have been something of a rogue from sources, there is reason to believe that he may have fabricated the account of how he acquired the library in order to enhance its reputation. Apellicon's library contained a remarkable old copy of the Iliad. He is said to have published a biography of Aristotle, in which the calumnies of other biographers were refuted.

It was an important battle between the Danish-backed King Sverker II of Sweden and Prince Eric. Eric's forces imposed a crushing victory; however in July 1210, Sverker returned with a second army and was killed in the Battle of Gestilren. Background The period 1150‚Äì1250 saw a strong rivalry between the House of Sverker and House of Eric who alternated on the Swedish throne. The main representative of the House of Eric, Eric Knutsson, returned from exile in Norway in 1207‚Äì08. There were marital connections between his family and the Norwegian ruling elite, but the sparse sources do not tell if he was backed by Norwegian troops. Sverker II was forced to flee to Denmark where he had been raised before becoming king. All this suggests that a large part of the Swedish nobility rejected Sverker's rule.Philip Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden 1130‚Äì1290. Leiden: Brill, 2007, , p. 107. Sverker's kinsman, King Valdemar the Victorious of Denmark provided Sverker with auxiliaries, including a Czech contingent from Valdemar's father-in-law, the King Ottokar I of Bohemia. The bulk of the troops, however, were gathered by Sverker's in-laws, the powerful Sunesen brothers.P.A. Munch, Det norske Folks historie, Vol. III. Christiania: T√∏nsbergs, 1857, p. 529. The army was led by Ebbe Sunesen, brother of Archbishop Andreas Sunesen. Medieval traditions estimate the size of the force at 12,000 or 18,000, although these numbers might be vastly exaggerated.A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: H√∂rbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 234. The defending Swedish force was, again according to later tradition, half of that of Sverker's forces, numbering between 7,000 and 10,000. It is often assumed that Erik's army was made up in part by Norwegian auxiliaries. This has been questioned by Norwegian historian P.A. Munch, who considered it unlikely that Eric's ally, Jarl H√•kon Galen, would have had any troops to spare during the ongoing Norwegian civil wars.P.A. Munch, Det norske Folks historie, Vol. III. Christiania: T√∏nsbergs, 1857, p. 530. Battle The invading army entered V√§sterg√∂tland in the middle of the winter. Frozen lakes and rivers may in fact have facilitated transportation of the troops. They met their adversary at Lena on January 31, 1208. No contemporary sources describe the battle in detail. We only know that the Danish troops suffered a crushing defeat, and that Ebbe Sunesen and his brother Laurentius were killed. The Icelandic Flateyarb√≥k states that \\"Junker Eric slew Ebbe Sunesen\\", possibly implying a personal meeting on the battlefield.Sven Axelson, Sverige i utl√§ndsk annalistik 900-1400. Stockholm, 1955, p. 77. Knut Jarl of the House of Bj√§lbo was killed as well, probably on the Swedish side. Also killed in the mel√©e was a Magnus, possibly Knut Jarl's uncle Magnus Minniski√∂ld, father of Birger Jarl.A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: H√∂rbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 286. Perhaps the Swedes used the winter weather to their advantage, as the Danish knights were slow and vulnerable in heavy snow. Later Swedish and Danish tradition, while not reliable, bears witness of the impression that the cataclysmic battle made on posterity. A Swedish verse depicted the event as a plain battle between Sweden and Denmark: \\"It happened in Lena / Two Danes ran for one (Swede) / And from the Swedish men / Received a bad spanking on their backs\\".P. Wieselgren, Sveriges sk√∂na litteratur, Vol. II. Lund: Gleerup, 1834, p. 509. A Danish folksong emphasizes the sorry internal Swedish conditions, as kinsmen fought each other: \\"It was ill to stand in the fighting / As the son let his father down\\".A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm: H√∂rbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 235. A song alleges that no more than 55 men escaped the bloodbath and made it back to Denmark: : The ladies stand on the high balcony, : They await their masters to arrive. : The horses return bloodied, : And the saddles are empty.A.M.

Beijers F√∂rlag (1885‚Äì86), Vol. 1, p. 325 The Norwegian Saga of Inge B√•rdsson relates that a horseman arrived to the farmstead of a smith at Nesje on 26 January, and stayed over night. The next morning the stranger baffled the smith through a display of supernatural powers, then said: \\"I have been to the north, and stayed in Norway for a long time, but I will now move over to Sweden.\\" He then disclosed to the smith that he was Odin, spurred his horse, and jumped over a high fence out in the blue. Four days after this event, the Battle of Lena took place.P.A. Munch, Det norske Folks historie, Vol. III. Christiania: T√∏nsbergs, 1857, pp. 530-1. Aftermath Among the few survivors was Sverker II who fled to Denmark. The Pope took interest in the cause of the fallen king and ordered Eric Knutsson to settle the matter and return kingship to Sverker. When Eric declined to meet these demands, Sverker returned from his Danish refuge with a new army. This second invasion ended with the Battle of Gestilren in July 1210. This time Sverker himself was killed, an event that secured the throne for King Eric.Philip Line, Kingship and State Formation in Sweden 1130-1290. Leiden: Brill, 2007, , p. 108.

The group was originally known as the New York chapter of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee (PFOC), an organization devoted to legally promoting the causes of the Weather Underground. This was part of the Prairie Fire Manifesto's change in Weather Underground Organization strategy, which demanded both aboveground mass movements and clandestine organizations. The role of the clandestine organization would be to build the \\"consciousness of action\\" and prepare the way for the development of a people's militia. Concurrently, the role of the mass movement (i.e., above ground Prairie Fire Collective) would include support for, and encouragement of, armed action. Such an alliance would, according to Weather, \\"help create the 'sea' for the guerrillas to swim in.\\" The M19CO name was derived from the birthdays of Ho Chi Minh and Malcolm X. The May 19 Communist Organization was active from 1978 to 1985. M19CO was a combination of the Black Liberation Army and the Weather Underground. It also included members of the Black Panthers and the Republic of New Africa (RNA). In addition to the May 19th Communist Organization being made up of the Black Liberation Army, the group was formed because of infighting in the Weather Underground Organization. Following the split of the Weather Underground Organization into factions, the faction that favored more extreme actions to achieve its objectives joined the Black Liberation Army, forming the May 19th Communist Organization. One of the founders, Laura Whitehorn, was also part of the Weather Underground Organization's predecessor, the Students for a Democratic Society. In addition to being known as the May 19th Communist Organization and the New York chapter of the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee, the group was also known as the Armed Resistance Movement, the Red Guerilla Resistance, Resistance Conspiracy, and Revolutionary Fighting Group. Despite these other monikers, the group was most popularly known as the May 19th Communist Organization, predicated on the Communist Vietnamese leader Ho Chi Minh's birthday. Members of the May 19th Communist Organization, even when showing support for the group's goals of ridding the United States of racism, police brutality, and insufficient public housing, were often accused of not being fervent enough about the causes that the group pursued. Objectives This alliance between the Weather Underground and the Black Liberation Army had three objectives: * Free political prisoners in US prisons * Appropriate capitalist wealth (armed robberies) to fund the third stage, and * Initiate a series of bombings and terrorist attacks *On top of the goals of freeing political prisoners in the United States, appropriating capitalist wealth to fund operations, and initiating a series of bombings and terrorist attacks, the group had the broader goal of violently toppling established power in the United States. These goals were aimed at the eventual goal of transforming the political landscape in the United States from one of capitalism to one of communism. This regime change was predicated on the idea that capitalism oppressed the public, particularly those that were imprisoned under the capitalist system, believing that such actions could not be undertaken in the American political system. Activities From 1982 to 1985 M19CO committed a series of bombings, including bombings of the National War College, the Washington Navy Yard Computing Center, the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building, New York City's South African consulate, the Washington Navy Yard Officers' Club, New York City's Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, and the United States Capitol Building. Three officers were killed during the Brinks Robbery, but no one was injured or killed in their bombings. Almost all the M19CO members were convicted in a US Court of Law for these offenses, but Elizabeth Ann Duke remains at large. *In 1979 three members walked into the visitor‚Äôs center at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women near Clinton, took two guards hostage, and freed Assata Shakur, a member of the Black Liberation Army. Shakur was serving a sentence of life plus 26 to 33 years for the murder of a state trooper. *Several months later they arranged for the escape of William Morales, a member of the Puerto Rican separatist group, the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci√≥n Nacional Puertorrique√±a (FALN), from Bellevue Hospital in New York City where he was recovering after a bomb he was building exploded in his hands. *In 1981 Weather Underground members Kathy Boudin, Judith Alice Clark, and David Gilbert, together with several members of the Black Liberation Army, participated in the robbery of a Brinks armored car at the Nanuet Mall, near Nyack, New York, during which a Brinks guard and two Nyack police officers were killed. Upon her arrest Boudin was identified as a member of the May 19 Communist Organization. The attack resulted in the theft of $1.6 million, intended to create an ethnostate for black Americans in the south, termed \\"New Afrika.\\" *On January 28, 1983, M19CO bombed the federal building on Staten Island, N.Y. *On April 25, 1983, the group was responsible for a bombing at the National War College at Fort McNair in Washington, D.C. *On November 7, 1983, the group triggered a bomb explosion at the US Senate. *On August 18, 1983, it bombed the Washington Navy Yard Computer Center. *On April 5, 1984, it bombed the Israeli Aircraft Industries Building. *On April 20, 1984, M19CO committed a bombing at the Washington Navy Yard Officers Club. *On September 26, 1984, the South African consulate was bombed. *On November 3, 1984, two members of the M19CO, Susan Rosenberg and Timothy Blunk, were arrested at a mini-warehouse they had rented in Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Police recovered more than 100 blasting caps, nearly 200 sticks of dynamite, more than 100 cartridges of gel explosive, and 24 bags of blasting agent from the warehouse. *M19CO's last bombing was on February 23, 1985, at the Policemen's Benevolent Association in New York City. Arrests By May 23, 1985, all members of the group had been arrested, with the exception of Elizabeth Duke, who remains a fugitive. Alleged rioter Donna Joan Borup was arrested but failed to appear at trial and is currently on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorist list. Donna Borup \\"is thought to have a photographic memory and is highly intelligent,\\" according to the FBI. Marilyn Jean Buck was arrested in 1985 and was, prior to joining the May 19th Communist Organization, the only white member of the Black Liberation Army, one of the two groups that formed the May 19th Communist Organization. While the May 19th Communist Organization was made up of individuals of several racial heritages, the Black Liberation Army was previously entirely made up of black Americans, save for Marilyn Jean Buck. On October 20th, 1981, Judith Clark was arrested in connection to the attack on the armored Brinks truck. Clark was the spokesperson of the May 19th Communist Organization as of 1978, and was previously a member of one of the May 19th Communist Organization's predecessor groups, the Prairie Fire Organizing Committee. Judith Clark was released on May 10, 2019, 37 years after she was arrested on the same day as the robbery of the armored Brinks truck.  Impact  The May 19th Communist Organization, along with other domestic terrorist organizations like the United Freedom Front and the Aryan Nations, are noted as having advanced the FBI's strategy and capacity to investigate domestic terrorism in the United States. Following Congressional hearings in the mid-1970s, the FBI's capacity for surveillance of domestic terrorist groups was curtailed due to alleged overreach. This rollback on the FBI's ability to gather intelligence allowed the May 19th Communist Organization and the United Freedom Front to conduct terror attack in the late 1970s, which garnered a renewed support for the FBI's ability to gather intelligence about domestic terrorist organizations in order to prevent future attacks. In 1982, FBI director William H. Webster reported to the Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism that the Justice Department was relaxing rules that allowed the FBI to keep surveillance on domestic terrorist groups, inspired by the actions of the May 19th Communist Organization, as well as the Socialist Workers Party, the Progressive Labor Party, and the May 19th Communist Organization's predecessor group, the Weather Underground Organization. These new guidelines were aimed at repressing domestic terrorist organizations while not curtailing legitimate political protest and dissent. Francis McNamara, former executive secretary of the House Committee on Un-American Activities, allegedly sought a return to McCarthy-era politics, surveilling Americans who were involved in communist or left-wing organizations, and allowing these political views to deem the May 19th Communist Organization a terrorist group following the 1981 robbery of an armored Brinks truck perpetrated by members of the May 19th Communist Organization.

The Prime Meridian passes just to the west of Bar Hill. History The site of Bar Hill in the late 1940s Planning for the village began in the late 1950s to alleviate the housing shortage in South Cambridgeshire, and the first residents arrived in 1967. The village grew rapidly and by 1975 there was a population of 1,673 in its 599 homes, though it was only 40% of its intended size. Expansion continued in the 1980s and in 1989 the final house of the original plan was completed, 23 years after building had begun and 15 years after its planned completion. The population was at that time over 5000. Its name originated from the fact that it was built along an old Roman Road that had a Toll Bar/gate (the \\"Bar\\" part) which was used in the local area as the farm's name, Bar Farm. The farm house still remains next to the village school. The toll gate was also located roughly near this building. The village was built on or around one of the many hills in the area, hence the name \\"Bar Hill\\". It is accessible on the B1050 road, off A14 exit 29. =2014 Flood= On 8 August 2014 the village came to national prominence when over 100mm of rain fell in a period of approximately 30 minutes causing many parts of the village to become flooded. Village life The village has a shopping mall (with a large Tesco Extra supermarket as anchor store), library (in which, unusually, a post office is also located), primary school, multi-denominational church (rebuilt in 1991) and a pub called The Fox. A skate park was built in the village but has largely been demolished. There is also a championship 18 hole golf course and hotel. The village also has two fields (one large field known to locals mostly as \\"The village green\\" and the smaller school playing field located near the farmhouse) which are used to host sporting events and council events such as the annual village f√™te. It has a cycle path to Dry Drayton, known as The Drift. There is also a footpath that leads to the small village of Lolworth. Bar Hill was originally contained within a ring road when it was first developed, but with the expansion and development of the area, it began to spill out. For example the \\"Gleneagles\\" development overlooking the golf course. In 2017, Bar Hill was one of many areas that benefitted by the A14 road (England) Cambridge to Huntingdon Improvement Scheme which was completed in 2020.

Her first works were published in the literary journal Misao in 1920, while she was studying at the University of Belgrade. Within a few years, her poems appeared in the Serbian Literary Herald, Belgrade's most influential literary publication. In 1925, Maksimoviƒá earned a French Government scholarship for a year's study at the University of Paris. Upon her return, she was appointed a professor at Belgrade's elite First High School for Girls, a position she would hold continuously until World War II. In 1933, Maksimoviƒá married Sergej Slastikov, a Russian √©migr√© writer. After being dismissed from her post at the high school by the Germans in 1941, she was reduced to a state of poverty and forced to work odd jobs to survive the three-year occupation. She was only permitted to publish children's literature during this period, but secretly compiled a collection of patriotic poems, which were not published until after the war. Among these was Krvava bajka (A Bloody Tale), about the Wehrmacht's killing of schoolchildren in the Kragujevac massacre. It was recited extensively in post-war commemorative ceremonies and became one of the best known Serbian-language poems. To mark her 60th birthday, Maksimoviƒá was named the recipient of a string of honours and awards in 1958. In 1964, she published one of her most acclaimed works, a volume of reflective poetry entitled Tra≈æim pomilovanje (I Seek Clemency). The work's veiled critique of the Tito government made it especially popular. The following year, she became a full-fledged member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Following her husband's death in 1970, Maksimoviƒá's poetry increasingly began to revolve around the subject of human mortality. Maksimoviƒá travelled extensively in the 1970s and 1980s, and some of her visits abroad inspired several of her works. She became involved in efforts to combat government censorship in the early 1980s and was active until her death in 1993. Maksimoviƒá was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance within Yugoslav literary circles and among the general public. One literary scholar notes that she served as an example for other Serbian women wishing to take up the craft. Maksimoviƒá's reputation, which was such that most of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name, has led one author to describe her as \\"the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century\\". Biography =Childhood= Maksimoviƒá spent much of her childhood in Brankovina Desanka Maksimoviƒá was born in the village of Rabrovica, near Valjevo, on 16 May 1898. She was the oldest of her parent's seven children. Her father Mihailo was a schoolteacher and her mother Draginja (n√©e Petroviƒá) was a housewife. Maksimoviƒá's ancestors had migrated to Serbia from Herzegovina in the late 18th century. Her maternal grandfather was an Eastern Orthodox priest. Within two months of her birth, her father was reassigned to the nearby village of Brankovina, and the family had to relocate. Maksimoviƒá spent much of her early childhood in Brankovina. She took an interest in reading at an early age, spending hours in her father's library. When she was 10, the family moved to Valjevo. Maksimoviƒá's family was devastated by World War I. In 1915, she lost her father to typhus while he was serving in the Royal Serbian Army. Her father's death thrust the family into difficult financial straights. In order to be able to take care of her mother and her siblings, Maksimoviƒá was forced to drop out of high school. In her free time, she learned French. She re-enrolled after the war and completed her secondary education in 1919. =Early career= Upon completing high school, Maksimoviƒá moved to Belgrade, the capital of the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. She enrolled in the University of Belgrade, and took courses in art history and comparative literature. By this time, Maksimoviƒá had been writing verse for a number of years. She gave some of her poems to one of her former professors, who in turn gave them to Velimir Masuka, the editor-in- chief of Misao (Thought), one of Serbia's leading artistic and literary publications. Maksimoviƒá (front row, centre) at a meeting of Yugoslav writers in 1929 Maksimoviƒá's poetry first appeared in Misao between 1920 and 1921. She received what was to be the first of many literary awards when one of her poems was voted to be the journal's best by its readers. Within a few years, the Srpski knji≈æevni glasnik (Serbian Literary Herald), then Belgrade's most influential and respected literary journal, began printing her poems, and several of her works appeared in an anthology of Yugoslav lyric poetry. In 1924, Maksimoviƒá published her first poetry collection, simply entitled Pesme (Poems). The collection was met with positive reviews. Maksimoviƒá graduated from the University of Belgrade around this time and received a fellowship from the Government of France for a year's study at the University of Paris. She returned to Belgrade in 1925, and upon her return, received a Saint Sava medal from the government for her literary achievements and became a professor at the city's elite First High School for Girls. By the late 1920s, the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes was mired by ethnic tensions. In 1929, King Alexander decreed that it be renamed Yugoslavia to mitigate growing nationalist resentment. Before long, the country's political disputes spilled over into literary discourse. Yugoslav writers could not agree on the political and artistic direction Yugoslav literature should take. Older writers favoured abiding by existing literary norms while younger ones promoted modernism as a means of explaining the contradictions of modern life and exploring the human subconscious. Maksimoviƒá's steadfast refusal to deviate from traditional literary forms and traditions prompted scathing critiques from many of her colleagues in the Yugoslav literary establishment. She would later note: \\"I would not have had as many friends as I have now if I had not been able to forget the biting jokes or critical remarks about my poetry or myself.\\" Yugoslavia had to endure difficult economic conditions during the Great Depression and the country's political landscape deteriorated further. During this time, Maksimoviƒá made poetry the main focus of her writing. Many of her poems were first recited before her fellow writers in the home of Smilja ƒêakoviƒá, the publisher of Misao. In 1933, Maksimoviƒá married a Russian-born writer named Sergej Slastikov. Following the German-led Axis invasion and subsequent occupation of Yugoslavia, Maksimoviƒá was forcibly retired from her teaching position at the First High School for Girls at the behest of the occupational authorities. Impoverished, she resorted to giving private lessons, sowing children's clothes and selling dolls in the marketplace. In order to heat her apartment, Maksimoviƒá had to walk from downtown Belgrade to Mount Avala to collect firewood. She wrote patriotic poems in secret during this time but was only allowed to publish children's books. =Later life= Maksimoviƒá attending a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of Ivo Andriƒá's birth, October 1992 After the war, Yugoslavia became a socialist state under the leadership of Josip Broz Tito. Maksimoviƒá was reinstated as a professor at the First High School for Girls. In 1946, she published a collection of war poems titled Pesnik i zaviƒçaj (The Poet and His Native Land). The collection contained one of her best known poems, Krvava bajka (A Bloody Fairy Tale), a requiem for the children killed in the Kragujevac massacre of October 1941. Although she was not a communist, her works received the approval of the Yugoslav government. Maksimoviƒá was a fervent Russophile, and at times, her Russophilia was mistaken for covert Cominformism, a serious charge in the years following the Tito‚ÄìStalin Split, that if proven, could have landed a person in prison. Maksimoviƒá retired from teaching in 1953. In 1958, to mark her 60th birthday, Maksimoviƒá received a number of awards from the Yugoslav government and literary establishment. The following year, she received partial membership in the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts (SANU). In 1964, Maksimoviƒá published a volume of reflective poetry entitled Tra≈æim pomilovanje (I Seek Clemency), which dealt with the 14th-century reign of Du≈°an the Mighty, the founder of the Serbian Empire. The collection was well received and quickly became a bestseller. Its veiled critique of Tito made it especially popular, especially among those frustrated with the Yugoslav government's increasing arbitrariness and corruption. Maksimoviƒá was the recipient of further honours over the next several years. In 1965, her colleagues voted to make her a full member of the SANU. By this time, Maksimoviƒá was not only well known and respected within Yugoslavia, but also abroad, with her works having been translated into dozens of languages. Among the translators of her works was the Russian poet Anna Akhmatova. In 1967, Maksimoviƒá was awarded a medal by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Maksimoviƒá's husband died in 1970. Following his death, her poems increasingly began to deal with the topic of human mortality. In 1975, she received a Vuk Karad≈æiƒá Award for Lifetime Achievement from the SANU, becoming only the second writer to receive the honour, after Nobel laureate Ivo Andriƒá. The following year, Maksimoviƒá published Letopis Perunovih potomaka (A Chronicle of Perun's Descendants), a poetry collection dealing with medieval Balkan history. She travelled widely in the 1970s and 1980s, visiting many European nations, including the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, but also Australia, Canada, the United States, and China. Her visits to Norway and Switzerland inspired the poetry collection Pesme iz Norve≈°ke (Poems from Norway; 1976) and a travel book titled Snimci iz ≈†vajcarske (Snapshots from Switzerland; 1978). In 1982, Maksimoviƒá became one of the founding members of the Committee for the Protection of Artistic Freedom, which sought an end to government censorship. In 1988, she published a poetry collection titled Pamtiƒáu sve (I Shall Remember Everything). She died in Belgrade on 11 February 1993, aged 94. Legacy Statue in Valjevo \\"Maksimoviƒá ... marked a whole era with her lyrical poetry,\\" the literary scholar Aida Vidan writes. She was the first female Serbian poet to gain widespread acceptance from her predominantly male colleagues within the Yugoslav literary milieu, as well as the first Serbian female poet to attract a significant following among the general public. She was Yugoslavia's leading female literary figure for seven decades, first acquiring this distinction during the interwar period and retaining it until her death. The scholar Dubravka Juraga describes her as \\"the beloved doyenne of Yugoslav belles lettres\\". Maksimoviƒá \\"offered women writers a model of achievement in the field of lyric poetry,\\" the literary scholar Celia Hawkesworth writes. Hawkesworth compares Maksimoviƒá's contributions to Serbian literature to that of Elisaveta Bagriana in Bulgaria, Wis≈Çawa Szymborska in Poland, and Nina Cassian in Romania. The author Christopher Deliso describes Maksimoviƒá as \\"the most beloved Serbian poet of the twentieth century\\". During her lifetime, her reputation was such that many of her contemporaries referred to her simply by her first name. Her poem Krvava bajka is widely considered one of the best known pieces of Serbian-language verse. She is also credited with popularizing love locks in the former Yugoslavia through one of her poems. By the early 2000s, the phenomenon had spread to other parts of the globe. A statue of Maksimoviƒá was unveiled in Valjevo on 27 October 1990, while she was still alive. In the 1990s, as part of the renaming of communist- era street names following the breakup of Yugoslavia, ƒêuro Salaj Street in Belgrade was renamed Desanka Maksimoviƒá Street. In May 1996, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia issued a commemorative postage stamp in her honour. A bronze statue of Maksimoviƒá was erected in Belgrade's Ta≈°majdan Park on 23 August 2007.

Edwards came to Edmonton about a year and a half ago from Peterboro, Ont., where he was born and spent his early life. He is a graduate of Toronto University with the degrees of M.A. and LL.B. He was admitted to the bar of Ontario and practiced law with W.E. Scott brothers of Mr. Justice Scott, of Alberta. For twenty years he was city solicitor of Peterboro, a city which is now sixth in the Dominion for manufacturing output, and has thus a close insight into the management of municipal affairs. Colonel Edwards is now brigadier of the 7th Infantry with headquarters at Kingston. This battalion comprised the 14th, 46th 47th, 49th and 57th regiments. He is a past president of the Ontario Curling Association, one of the largest sporting organizations in the world. He was chairman of the special committee which received the touring Scotch curlers in Ontario two years ago. He has also occupied the office of commodore of the American Canoe Association. ************************************************* Military Matters 24 Apr 1909N04P0767 Edmonton Bulletin 24 Apr 1909 N04P0767 MILITARY MATTERS During the past year there has been a marked increase in the interest taken in military matters in Edmonton and the next few months should see even greater activity in military circles, not only in this city, but throughout the whole of western Canada. The Dominion government has been hampered by lack of funds in their efforts to raise military units in the west. They have done good work in this respect in the past and are every year making many, much-needed improvements. This is a new country, however, and a pretty extensive one and it takes time to introduce all the modern conveniences and equipment so necessary to the maintenance of an ideal volunteer military system in the west. Officers and men who have been connected with military organizations in eastern Canada and in the old country realize to the fullest extant the difficulties under which they are laboring in the west and it speaks volumes for their patriotism and deep interest in the work of establishing a creditable volunteer system that they almost invariably take hold in a whole- hearted manner and endeavor to surmount the obstacles. There are dozens of examples of this right here in Edmonton, and it is due largely to the efforts of such men that Edmonton is now the centre for two first class military units. The outstanding feature in the military world of Edmonton during the past year has been the organization of a new infantry regiment known as the 101st Edmonton Fusiliers. Lt. Colonel Edwards is in command of this new regiment and is very enthusiastic over the way the organization work has been carried forward. He has associated with him an excellent staff of officers with considerable knowledge of military affairs. They are all very enthusiastic and are energetically carrying forward the work. Shortly after the organization of the 101st had been authorized classes were opened in the city for officers and non-commissioned officers. These were continued for six weeks and were well attended. Thirty three officers and twenty-six non-coms. qualified and obtained certificates. They were assigned to the eight companies of the regiment as follows:‚ÄîA Co.‚ÄîCaptain Osborne, Lieutenants Flint, Meneeley and Brown, Sergeants Gillespie, Ritchie, LeBlanc and Mohr. B Co.‚ÄîCaptain Weeks, Lieutenants Mulvey and Morris, Sergeants Gregory, Brunlees, Sherwood and Dredge. C Co.‚ÄîCaptain Harwood, Lieutenants Keefer, Delevault and Powley, Sergeants McRae, Hodson and Berry. D Co.‚ÄîCaptain Anderson, Lieutenants Crumb and McDonald, Sergeant Adams. E Co.‚ÄîCaptain Fisher, Lieutenants Bradburn, Stewart and Rix, Sergeants Balfour, Davies and Wilson. F Co.‚ÄîCaptain Carpenter, Lieutenants Stark, Higman, Spratt and Chadwick, Sergeants Weaver, Campbell and McDonald. G Co.‚ÄîCaptain Strong, Lieutenants McKenzie, Bellamy and Gorman, Sergeants Howland, Hawkins and Claassen. H Co.‚ÄîCaptain McLeod, Lieutenants Gillespie, Whittaker and Kelly, Sergeants Baty, E. J. Hazard, Porter and B. Hassard. No attempt was made until very recently to enroll the rank and file of the regiment. Recruiting has been carried forward during the past month however and fully one half of the total strength of the regiment has been enrolled. The total strength of the regiment will be 405, of whom 33 are officers and 372 non-commissioned officers and men. The formation of a regimental band with a total strength of 25 has been authorized. It is probable that arrangements will be made for the Citizens' band to become the regimental band. A signal corps will be formed consisting of two men from each company. A supernumerary lieutenant of each company has been appointed to fill any vacancies which might occur. In the first 150 enrolled in the 101st, over one-third have been members of military organizations in eastern Canada or the old country, and a number have seen active service in South Africa. A splendid class of men are being enrolled. A large number of these still retain the accent of bonny Scotland. There are a number from Ireland, several having been members of the famous Royal Irish Constabulary. England and Eastern Canada furnish a large number. There are a few Americans and French and two or three Ruthenians. The minimum height of the men enrolled in the 101st has been fixed at 5 feet, 7 inches. The standard minimum height for militiamen in England and elsewhere is 5 feet, 4 inches. In Canada the minimum height of the Governor General's Foot Guards has also been placed at 5 feet, 7 inches. The number of men enrolled in the 101st who are 5 feet, 10 and 11 inches, and even 6 feet high, is surprisingly large. D Company is being recruited in Strathcona, and drill is held there. Regular drill is being held in the city twice a week, on Tuesday and Friday evenings. A number of the companies are also holding extra drills. Drill is being held at the Separate school hall at the present time, but as soon as the evenings lengthen open air drill will be commenced possibly on the exhibition grounds or Hudson Bay flats. A bugle band is being organized in connection with the regiment. Allowance in age and height is being made for buglers. A number of young fellows who have a taste for this are required to complete the bugle band. Although there are now two strong military organizations in the city there is still no armory. The militia department planned to erect a large armory here this summer, but up to the present the appropriation required for this purpose has not been authorized. The 101st Fusiliers are endeavoring to secure temporary quarters in the curling rink and the waiting room is being used at the present time for the quartermaster's stores. If the rink is secured, as is expected, it will mean that a number of rooms will be built along the west side of the building on the space occupied in the past by the No. 4 loe. Eight rooms for the companies in the regiment will be built and also a band room, quarter master's store room, buglers' room and a sergeants' room. The officers will use the present waiting room and the room above it. A large quantity of equipment for the new regiment has been received. Sixteen large cases of clothing have arrived and are being issued. Three hundred and seventy-two Ross rifles have also arrived, which with the 75 used in the training school will be used for drill. The clothing received included serge jacket and trousers, a set of blue linen for fatigue dress, a full dress tunic, peak caps of a naval pattern, helmets for ceremonial drill and warm weather work, and chevrons and badges for the staff sergeants, sergeants, corporals, bandsmen and buglers. Rifle practice at the ranges is going to prove a very attractive part of the drill this summer. The ranges are located on the south bank of the river and some little distance east. They will be put in proper condition at the earliest possible moment. A ferry will be installed on the river opposite the ranges as soon as the ice on the river goes out and rifle shooting should become very popular this year. In the 101st there are already a large number of expert shots, and they will not only be able to make a good showing for themselves, but will be able to instruct new men. The 101st is the first Canadian regiment to be armed throughout with the mark 2 Ross rifle. These rifles have been declared by experts to be far superior to the old rifles used. One of the great advantages is the low trajectory of the rifle. With the old Snyder-Enfield rifle a man on a load of hay could drive midway between the marksman and a 500-yard target, provided his head was not more than 26 feet from the ground, and be uninjured. With the Ross rifle, however, a man 5 feet 6 inches in height, crossing between the marksman and target at the 500 yard range would be in danger of being shot through the neck. The muzzle velocity of the mark 2 Ross rifle is 200 feet per second greater than any other rifle. The variations in elevation are not so great and the bullet as a consequence, is less affected by the wind. There was a large attendance at drill last night, some of the companies taking their first out-of-door drill. The following regimental orders by Lieut. Col. E. B. Edwards, commanding the 101st regiment, with headquarters at Edmonton, were read: 1‚ÄîTo be orderly officer for the week ending, April 24, Captain F. A. Osborne; next for duty, Captain W. S. Weeks. 2‚ÄîTo be battalion orderly sergeant for the week ending April 24, Color Sergeant Howland; next for duty, Color Sergeant Weaver. 3‚ÄîTo be orderly bugler, E. Baty. The names of the men enrolled up to the present were read. The coming summer promises to be an active one also for the 19th Alberta Mounted Rifles with headquarters at Edmonton. This regiment will be stronger than ever this year. In Edmonton, which is the headquarters for A squadron, many new men are being enrolled. They are a better class than formerly and are picking up the drill very rapidly. A few months ago arrangements were made whereby A squadron would commence drill. All Saints school room was secured for this purpose and every Tuesday evening rifle and bayonet drill was held. A large number of new men joined the squadron and entered enthusiastically into the work of reorganization. Interesting lectures were delivered on military topics throughout the winter and it is the intention to hold a number of smokers and social functions in order to keep the men together. New uniforms have been ordered for the men and are expected to arrive at an early date. The 19th is laboring under the same difficulties as the 101st through lack of a suitable armory or proper equipment. A squadron armory is located on Eighth street, but the officers and men will all gladly welcome the erection of a new and up-to- date armory in the city. The mounted regiments in the west go into camp every year for two weeks during the summer. This year camp opens on June 29, two weeks later than in former years. In this way it is hoped to escape much of the wet weather. The place of the camp has not yet been definitely decided. It is possible that brigade camp for military district No. 13 will be held in Calgary again this year. The 19th A. M. R., however, may hold regimental camp at Edmonton. An effort is being made to hold brigade camp here in the future. It is now three years since a training camp was held in Edmonton. Six weeks training school will be held at Edmonton prior to camp. Army signalling will likely be pushed forward briskly in the city this year as both the 101st and the 19th are planning to raise signal corps. Sergeant Major Hopkins, of A squadron, 19th A. M. R., has been appointed supernumerary lieutenant and will have charge of the signal corps. Recruits for the 19th signal corps are now being called for and active drill will start shortly. The 101st are also planning to form a signal corps, although their signal officer has not yet been appointed. Sergeant Major Baty is a qualified signaller and will doubtless assist in the instruction of the corps. The Fusiliers have organized a strong athletic club in connection with the regiment and sports of all kinds will flourish this year. It is the intention to organize amateur baseball, football and cricket teams this year and to enter men from this organization in almost every line of athletics. The following are the officers of the 101st Athletic club:‚ÄîHon. president‚ÄîCol. E. B. Edwards. Hon. vice-president‚ÄîMajor Carstairs. Hon. chaplain‚ÄîRev. Dr. McQueen. President‚ÄîCapt. Dr. Strong. Vice- president‚ÄîCapt. Geo. B. McLeod. Secretary-treasurer‚ÄîLieut. A. C. Gillespie. Executive committee‚ÄîSergt. Major Baty, Color Sergt. Howland, Color Sergt. Adams, Sergt. Hodson and Pte Mahoney. Recent activities The unit continues to carry out individual and small unit training. The unit celebrated its 100th anniversary in April 2008. In September 2011 the Eddies sent a number of soldiers on a decentralised basic parachute course with 3 PPCLI.http://www.army.gc.ca/iaol/143000440001977/143000440001978/index- Eng.html The regiment expanded to Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, with the establishment of C Company, The Loyal Edmonton Regiment, in August 2009.

His wife Lona was also an agent. They became spies because of their communist beliefs. Early life and education Morris Cohen was born in Harlem, New York City, on July 2, 1910 to a Jewish immigrant family. His father had immigrated from an area near Kiev in present-day Ukraine. His mother was from Vilnius in present-day Lithuania; the couple had met and married in New York. Cohen was a football standout at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. After briefly attending New York University he was awarded an athletic scholarship to Mississippi A&M; College (now Mississippi State University). He was injured in a freshman game. No longer able to play football, he was kept on scholarship as athletic manager. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business, and after a year of graduate work transferred to the University of Illinois. There he was active in agitprop work for the National Student League, a communist front. He was declared persona non grata after one semester and returned to the Bronx, where he became a full member and organizer for the American Communist Party. After World War II, he received a master's degree in education from Columbia University. Career =Military service= Detail of plaque of Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion monument In 1937, Cohen joined the Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion and fought as a foreign national volunteer in the Spanish Civil War, as did others who were sympathetic to the anti-Franco movement. He met Amadeo Sabatini, a career Soviet spy who recruited him. After being injured, in November 1938 Cohen returned to the United States. He began serving Soviet foreign intelligence. =Soviet espionage= In mid-1942, Cohen was drafted into the U.S. Army and served in Europe. He was discharged from the Army in November 1945 and returned to the United States where he resumed his espionage work for the Soviet Union. As Soviet spy networks were compromised in this period, connection with Soviet intelligence was temporarily ended, but resumed in 1948, when the Rezidentura ascertained that Cohen could be approached. Together with Lona Cohen, they ensured the continued secret connection with a number of the most valuable sources of the Rezidentura. They began working with Col. Rudolph Abel up to 1950, when they secretly left the United States and moved to Lublin, Poland. While in Poland, Morris and Lona engaged in numerous foreign missions for the Soviet Union, traveling to Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands.Carr, Barnes (2016) Operation Whisper: The Capture of Soviet Spies Morris and Lona Cohen. Lebanon NH: The University Press of New England. pp. 200‚Äì206. Cohen's former house in Ruislip (found to contain equipment and materials to aid the Cohen's activities) In 1954, the Cohens moved to 45 Cranley Drive in Ruislip, London where they had numerous pieces of hidden equipment for espionage, and an antenna looping around their attic, used for their transmissions to Moscow. Their cover was as antiquarian book dealers under the names of Peter and Helen Kroger working with KGB agent Konon Molody who used the cover name Gordon Lonsdale. =Arrest and trial= British security officials arrested the Cohens on January 7, 1961, for their part in a Soviet espionage network known as the Portland Spy Ring that had penetrated the Royal Navy. They were convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Morris and Lona served eight years in prison, less than half of their sentences, because they were subjects of a prisoner exchange. =Prisoner exchange= In 1967, the Soviet Union admitted that the Cohens were spies. In July 1969, Britain exchanged them for Gerald Brooke, a British subject held in the Soviet Union. Both the United States and the UK had conducted such exchanges before, such as Soviet spy Rudolf Abel for U2 pilot Gary Powers, and Konon Molody for Greville Wynne in 1964. But In this case, the opposition criticised Harold Wilson's Labour Government for agreeing to release dangerous Soviet agents, such as the Krogers (i.e., the Cohens), in exchange for Brooke, described as a propagandist. Opponents claimed that it set a dangerous precedent and was an example of blackmail rather than a fair exchange. =Moscow= The Cohens lived in Moscow, where Morris trained spies for the Soviets. He and Lona were later given pensions by the KGB, and remained in the city for the remainder of their lives. Personal life and death Lona and Morris Cohen after being released from jail in 1969 In 1941, Cohen married Lona, a Communist Party activist. She later became a spy and courier for Manhattan Project physicist Theodore Hall. They were part of a ring of atomic spies who were later revealed to have been far more damaging to US interests than the Rosenberg ring. During some period, Cohen was an employee of Amtorg. After training Soviet agents in Moscow for decades, Cohen retired on a pension, as did his wife. He died in Moscow on June 23, 1995. Lona had died in 1992. Awards Cohen on a 1998 Russian stamp The Cohens were awarded the Order of the Red Banner and the Order of Friendship of Nations by the Soviet Union for their espionage work. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, they also were given the title of Hero of the Russian Federation by the Yeltsin government. Venona The Cohens are referenced in Venona decrypts 1239 KGB New York to Moscow, August 30, 1944; 50 KGB New York to Moscow, January 11, 1945, regarding an erroneous report that Morris Cohen had been killed in Europe. The Cohens helped pass Manhattan Project secrets to the Soviet Union. His code name in Soviet intelligence and the Venona files is \\"Volunteer\\". Representation in other media British playwright Hugh Whitemore dramatized the case as Pack of Lies, which was performed in London's West End, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. The play was produced on Broadway for 3¬Ω months in 1985, with Rosemary Harris starring; she won the best actress Tony award for her portrayal of a British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. The play was adapted as a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Alan Bates, Teri Garr and Daniel Benzali (as \\"Peter Schaefer,\\" i.e., \\"Peter Kroger\\"/ Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on CBS in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends), whose house was used as a base from which the British security services could spy on the Cohens. It explored the way that paranoia, suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time. Helene Hanff in her book, The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street (1973), refers to the Cohens‚Äô cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger. Under those identities, they were friends of London book dealer Frank Doel. Based on her long-term friendship with Doel, mostly via letters, she had earlier written and published 84 Charing Cross Road (1970), which was a bestseller.

It falls under the Papworth Everard and Caxton ward and lies within the diocese of Ely. The village covers an area of 1,053 ha. (2,602 a.) Boxworth is a relatively small village, with around 100 houses. History The place-name 'Boxworth' is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as Bochesuuorde. It appears as Bukeswrth in 1228 in the Feet of Fines. The name means 'Bucc's enclosure or homestead'.Eilert Ekwall, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names, p.57. In the 1664 Hearth Tax, a large house belonging to a gentleman, Mr Killingworth, accounted for eight hearths at Boxworth.Evans, N. and Rose, S., editors, Cambridgeshire Hearth Tax Returns, Michaelmas 1664, British Record Society, London, 2000, p.73. Boxworth's population, once considerable, shrank severely after the Middle Ages before recovering to reach a peak of c350 in the mid-19th century. In 1870‚Äì72, John Marius Wilson's Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described Boxworth like this: \\"BOXWORTH, a parish in the district of St. Ives and county of Cambridge; 3 miles WSW of Long-Stanton r. station, and 5 SSE of St. Ives. Post Town, Long-Stanton, under Cambridge. Acres, 2,521. Real property, ¬£2,946 Pop., 347. Houses, 64. The property is divided among a few. The living is a rectory in the diocese of Ely. Value, ¬£459.* Patron, G. Thornhill, Esq. The church has a monument of Sanderson, the blind professor of mathematics; and is good.\\" Village life Boxworth today has one public house, the Golden Ball. The pub dates from at least the 1760s, but took its current name in 1820. Church Recorded from the mid-12th century, when relics of St. 'Inicius' were said to be deposited there, the church of St Peter is an ancient edifice of flint and stone in the Decorated style, consisting of a chancel, a nave of four bays, a south aisle, north and south porches and a lofty, embattled tower containing a clock and one bell: in the church is a monument to Nicholas Saunderson LLD, FRS, the celebrated blind professor of mathematics at the University of Cambridge, who died on 19 April 1739. The church was thoroughly restored in 1868‚Äì9, and provides seating for 150 worshippers. There are some pictures and a description of the church at the Cambridgeshire Churches website. There is a more comprehensive history at www.british-history.ac.uk. The grave of the Rev. Arnold Kirke Smith, who was vicar for 38 years until his death in 1927; he had in his early years been a notable footballer Road The Road is designed to be a small access road to the rural outlying villages of Cambridge surrounding it, including Elsworth, Conington and Knapwell, and is usually quiet. However, as the village lies between two major roads ‚Äì the A428 and the notorious A14 (previously A604) ‚Äì it is occasionally used more heavily, especially when one of the major roads is blocked. In 2004‚Äì05, traffic calming measures in the form of chicanes were introduced at both ends of the village. This is considerably less traffic- calming than is found in surrounding villages, which make heavy use of road humps and speed-reduction signs. The traffic-calming measures are often a controversial issue. Development The village hall Between 2003 and 2005, plans were drawn up to build a wind farm on arable land in the north of Boxworth. A total of 16 turbines were planned, and a number of residents of the village started a campaign called \\"Stop Cambridge Wind Farm\\", with the aim of blocking the windfarm's construction. In early 2005 the application was rejected by Cambridgeshire County Council, and a subsequent appeal was also rejected. Record temperature The highest temperature ever recorded in Boxworth was 35.2 ¬∞C, on 1 August 1995.

She is known for her role in smuggling atomic bomb diagrams out of Los Alamos. She was a communist activist before marrying Morris Cohen. The couple became spies because of their communist beliefs. They were both arrested in Britain in 1961, and convicted of espionage for the Soviet Union the following year . After serving part of a prison sentence, Lona Cohen and her husband were exchanged by the British in 1969. They lived the remainder of their lives in Moscow, teaching spy skills.  Early life  Lona Cohen was born Leontine Theresa Petka in Adams, Massachusetts, the daughter of Polish Catholic immigrants. At the age of 15, Lona left her parents' home in Taftsville, Connecticut and moved to New York City. By 1928, she had joined the Socialist Party. While in Greenwich Village, Lona had left her parents' Catholic faith and had become an atheist. She also separated from the Socialist Party at this time, becoming a member of the Communist Party.Carr, p. 119. George Blake, a British mole for the Soviet Union, claimed in an interview that Lona was a \\"very, very resolute woman, very determined\\".George Blake interview, Red Files  Espionage  =In the United States= At the time of her marriage to Morris Cohen in 1941, she did not know that her husband was a spy for the Soviet Union.Carr, p. 126. That year he recruited her into Soviet espionage out of the New York rezidentura. She and Morris first worked for Soviet control officer Semyon Semyonov until Semyonov was identified to the FBI in an anonymous letter, after which he was recalled back to Moscow. After four months, Lona and Morris were assigned to a new control officer, Anatoli Yatskov.Carr, p. 150. The Cohens were first tasked with stealing for the Soviet Union details of newly developed American weapons. Lona met a young man, identified in her report as Allen, working at an aircraft plant in Hartford, Connecticut. She then asked Allen to smuggle a working model of a new machine gun out of his plant. He agreed, in exchange for $2,000. By carrying it on his shoulders beneath his coat, Allen was able to sneak it out of the plant. Morris then hid the weapon inside a bass fiddle case and transported it into the Soviet consulate while avoiding detection. After Morris was drafted in 1942, Lona took over the expanding Volunteer Network that Morris had been maintaining and managed seven agents. Their work was titled Line X. As part of Line X, Lona conducted \\"technical, scientific, and industrial espionage\\", delivering and receiving documents along the East Coast. She frequently received documents from seamen from South America and Europe, using her charm to persuade dock-workers to permit her access to the ships. Later, Semyonov wrote an appraisal of Cohen, commending her love of the Soviet Union and her work with agent Link, eventually identified as Bill Weisband.Carr, p. 135.Semyonov to Fitkin, circa 1944, KGB file 40129, vol. 3a, 212‚Äì 13, Vassiliev, White Notebook #1, 112‚Äì 13, LOC. While conducting her Line X work, she worked at two defense plants. First, in 1942, at Publix Metals as a machine operator, and then in 1943 at Aircraft Screw Products. While working at Aircraft Screw Products, Lona was in an accident and had part of her hair ripped from her head. A supervisor she worked under accused her of preaching Communism.Carr, p. 140. As word leaked to the Soviets of the developing Manhattan Project, Lona Cohen was chosen by her new control officer, Anatoli Yatskov, to work as a courier. Lona's job was to transport classified information from Theodore Hall, and a source cover named \\"FOGEL\\" and \\"PERS\\" from the American secret atomic weapons project at Los Alamos, New Mexico and carry them to the Soviet consulate in New York. There, a KGB sub-residency under a young engineer, Leonid R. Kvasnikov, coordinated operations and dispatched intelligence to Moscow.Carr, pp. 150‚Äì157.\\"Morris Cohen, 84, Soviet Spy Who Passed Atom Plans in 40's.\\" The New York Times, July 5, 1995. Lona met with Hall for the first time in late August 1945, outside a church in Albuquerque, New Mexico. She had been to this church the previous four Sundays, but Hall had been confused about the date of their meet and did not show up until nearly a month after originally scheduled. Hall gave her the report that she had traveled for, and she was sent back to New York. To avoid detection she concealed the report inside a Kleenex box, a move which became known within Soviet spy circles for its cleverness. After returning to New York, it was discovered that the report she had helped deliver contained a complete diagram of the first atomic bomb.Carr, pp. 162‚Äì165. After the defections of Elizabeth Bentley and Igor Gouzenko, the Cohens ended contact with Soviet intelligence until 1949, at which time they began working with Col. Rudolph Abel, a U.S.-based \\"illegal\\" (not using diplomatic cover for spying). =From 1950= After Klaus Fuchs was arrested in the United Kingdom in 1950, Cohen and her husband had no choice but to flee to Moscow. They left their home in New York and never returned to America, passing the southern border and travelling through Mexico. They were placed in Lublin, Poland, until 1954. There, Morris worked as an English teacher. The Cohens went on many foreign missions for the Soviets during this time, traveling to Japan, Hong Kong, Australia, New Zealand, Austria, Belgium, and the Netherlands. They received New Zealand passports in Paris from the New Zealand embassy, and also made trips to Canada.Carr, pp. 200‚Äì206. In Moscow, Lona had received additional training as a radio operator and cipher clerk. The Cohen's former house in Ruislip was found to contain equipment and materials for use in spying. In 1954, the couple settled in Ruislip, west London, under the names Helen and Peter Kroger. They used the New Zealand passports they had received in Paris and claimed to be native Canadians.Carr, p. 224. They set up an antiquarian book business which served as cover for their activities of running the London Illegal Rezidentura. Gordon Lonsdale (Konon Molody, a KGB agent) worked with them as part of the Portland Spy Ring. In the basement of their house, at 45 Cranley Drive, Ruislip, situated not far from the military airfield of RAF Northolt, they set up a high-speed radio transmitter and began sending Moscow \\"information of special importance\\". While in London, the Cohens were friends with Frank and Nora Doel. Frank Doel is the bookseller whose correspondence with the author Helene Hanff became the bestseller, 84 Charing Cross Road. In her follow-up book, The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street, Hanff reported an anecdote told her by Nora Doel. One New Year's Eve, the Doels gave a party at which Lona Cohen (aka Helen Kroger): > arrived looking very exotic in a long black evening dress. 'Helen, you look > like a Russian spy!' said Nora. And Helen laughed and Peter laughed and a > few months later Nora picked up the morning paper and discovered that Helen > and Peter Kruger were Russian spies.  Arrest, trial and imprisonment  In January 1961, the couple were arrested for espionage; in March she was convicted and received a sentence of 20 years. Her husband Morris Cohen was sentenced to 25 years. Before being taken into custody, Cohen/Kroger had asked permission to stoke up the boiler. Before she could do so, Detective Superintendent Smith, a veteran \\"spy catcher\\" who was in charge of the arrest, insisted on checking her handbag. It was found to contain microdots, the photographic reduction of documents, in order to make them small enough to be smuggled out of the country more easily. Prisoner exchange and later life in Moscow Lona and Morris Cohen after being released from jail in 1969 In 1969, the British arranged a prisoner exchange, trading the Cohens with the Soviet Union for a British subject, Gerald Brooke. Once in Moscow, the Cohens continued training colleagues for intelligence operations. Chapter 16 is entirely about a KGB agent's memoir of being trained by the Cohens in Moscow in the late 1970s. Later, the Cohens were provided with pensions by the KGB. Lona Cohen died in Moscow on December 23, 1992. She was 79 years of age. Her husband, Morris, lived for three more years following her death. They were both buried in the KGB's Novokuntsevo Cemetery.Carr, p. 287.  Awards  Both Lona and Morris Cohen received the Order of the Red Banner from the Soviet Union. Both were also given the title of Heroes of the Russian Federation.Carr, p. 286. Representation in other media In 1983, the British playwright Hugh Whitemore dramatized the case as Pack of Lies, which was performed in London's West End theatre district starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams. It played on Broadway for 3¬Ω months in 1985, for which Rosemary Harris won the best actress Tony award for her portrayal of the British neighbor of the Cohens/Krogers. It was made into a TV movie starring Ellen Burstyn, Alan Bates, Teri Garr and Daniel Benzali (as \\"Peter Schaefer\\", i.e., \\"Peter Kroger\\", i.e., Morris Cohen) which aired in the U.S. on CBS in 1987. The plot centered on the neighbors (and seeming friends) whose house was used as a base from which the security services could spy on the Cohens, and the way paranoia, suspicion and betrayal gradually destroyed their lives during that time. The Cohens' cover as antiquarian book dealers Peter and Helen Kroger is mentioned in Helene Hanff's The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street because they were friends of London book dealer Frank Doel, recipient of the letters and book orders that inspired the bestseller 84 Charing Cross Road.

These long and complex theme and variation tunes were traditionally transmitted orally by a combination of definite vocable syllables. In general, the vowels represent the notes, and consonants the grace notes, but this is not always the case, as the system has inconsistencies and was not fully standardized. Pipers have used musical staff notation to read and write pibroch tunes since the early nineteenth century. Many of the early staff notated scores for modern pibroch published by Angus MacKay and authorised by the Piobaireachd Society are now considered by scholars to have been oversimplified, with standardisations of time signatures and editing out of ornamental complexities, when tunes are compared with versions in earlier manuscripts such as the Campbell Canntaireachd. The practice of canntaireachd singing remains the preferred means for many pipers to convey the musicality and pacing of pibroch performance when teaching or rehearsing a tune. Canntaireachd was first written down at the end of the 18th century in the Campbell Canntaireachd by Colin Campbell of Nether Lorn, Argyll. While his vocable system had its origins in chanted notation, the Campbell Canntaireachd is now considered to have been intended as a written documentation of the music, to be read rather than sung. Nevertheless, Cambell's Nether Lorn Canntaireachd was adopted by the Piobaireachd Society in their publications and has become the most commonly used vocable system. Another related system of Canntaireachd was published by Niel McLeod of Gesto, reputedly taken down from the chanted singing of John MacCrimmon, one of the last practicing members of that esteemed piping family. The MacArthur family of pipers are reported to have had their own oral form of Canntaireachd system that was not documented. A further variety of Canntaireachd and distinct collection of pibroch tunes was sourced from Simon Fraser, whose family emigrated to Melbourne in the 19th century. It is assumed that different lineages of pipers developed distinct forms of Canntaireachd that were variations on a broadly similar system of sung vocable notation. This informal oral variation continues today in the practices of experienced piping musicians and teachers. William Donaldson, in The Highland Pipe and Scottish Society 1750-1950 states: Explanation of canntaireachd (Please note that the following sections use the convention of indicating standard notes by capital letters between quotation marks, and canntaireachd notes by lower case letters in italics, i.e. \\"A\\" is not the same as a. In a couple of cases, solfege is also used.) =Explanation of table= The table given is based on the advice of Charles Bannatyne of Salsburgh, Holyhead. Some of the notes resemble each other very closely, but the changes used are indicated, and the pronunciations are given approximately in brackets. The key note \\"Low A\\" is always represented in this notation by in, probably a contraction of An D√†ra Aon, the second one, to distinguish the key note from the first note on the chanter‚Äî\\"low G\\". \\"High A\\" is always i, but in a canntaireachd, it is often denoted by a preceding l, thus liu, and so confusion is avoided. \\"Low A\\" is either in, en, em, or simply n after some notes. The alternatives seem to have been used for the sake of euphony. \\"D\\" note is a and \\"B\\" note is a, but the qualifying effect of the grace notes ‚Äî \\"high G\\" represented by h, and \\"D\\" represented by d or h (the latter a contraction of \\"a‚Äô chorrag\\", the Gaelic name for the finger playing \\"D\\") prevents any confusion. The note \\"E\\" is represented by i. At the beginning of most of the MacCrimmon tunes and variations is l, which gives the keynote. It stands for \\"E\\" (soh), the dominant of the \\"low A\\" (doh). Where it does not occur, the tune will be found to start with a word like \\"hien\\", which denotes \\"E\\" with \\"High G\\" grace note, and then \\"low A\\". The vowel for \\"F\\" note is ie, and it is always made certain by the grace note d or h. \\"High G\\" is u, often distinguished by a preceding h. \\"High A\\" is often vi to distinguish it from the \\"E\\" note. When \\"F\\" succeeds \\"high A\\" in a tune, the word is often vie. Grace notes Regarding grace notes, h the aspirate, qualifies all notes down to \\"low A\\", but often where ha obviously means \\"B\\" note, it must be concluded that it should be written cha (xa). Similarly ho ho should be ho cho (ho xo). The letter d is used, as is t to denote both \\"High G\\" and \\"D\\" grace notes, but an examination of the notation word, makes a mistake unlikely, thus dieliu means \\"F\\" with \\"high G\\" grace note, and then \\"high A\\" and \\"G\\". Tihi means two \\"E\\"s played with two \\"G\\" grace notes. T and d resemble each other very closely in Gaelic, but the context in canntaireachd makes it always easy to see whether \\"high G\\" grace note or \\"D\\" is meant. It is necessary to explain the compound grace note systems. Dr is doubling of \\"low G\\" by a touch of \\"D\\" grace note, and open \\"low A\\", and so on, over the whole scale. The letters dr are obviously a contraction of d√† uair, two times, or twice. Tr√¨ means doubling of \\"low G\\" by \\"D\\" grace note, and as \\"A\\" is opened, double \\"E\\" by \\"F\\" and \\"E\\" and open \\"E\\". This is a \\"Crunluath\\" form. Tro is the same, at first, but the doubling of \\"E\\" is done with the grips from o or the \\"C\\" note. This is \\"Crunluath-a-mach\\" (outer \\"crunnluath\\"). These examples will make the rest easy. In many tunes where the tr type appears, it obviously when translated should only have been a dr type, this confusion being only to the similarity of d and t in Gaelic. The shake on \\"high A\\" is vivi. The other shakes are represented by rr, according to from where the beats and shakes are taken. This seems to be a contraction of \\"gearradh\\" meaning a \\"shake\\". A simple touch of a note before opening is always represented by a single r. For instance, such a word as radin signifies that \\"B\\" is to be touched with \\"Low G\\" (l√πdag) before opening; -din is \\"low A\\" with \\"D\\" grace note. Ho radin is the \\"C\\" note o with \\"high G\\" grace note keeping the ra- below \\"D\\" note, also an \\"A\\" note. Rules for the Grace note scheme 1 ‚Äì All grace notes and grace note types are forestrokes, that is they occur before the notes they embellish. They are \\"appoggiaturas\\" or \\"semiquaver\\" notes, or \\"Caciaturas\\" or demi-semi-quaver notes, which predominate. 2 ‚Äì All grace notes in canntaireachd are represented by consonants. 3 ‚Äì All compound forms are made by combining single forms. 4 ‚Äì All leading or scale notes are represented by vowels. 5 ‚Äì All note forms with m or n in them contain \\"low A\\". 6 ‚Äì Grace notes h and d are qualifying or modulating grace notes. 7 ‚Äì Doublings are represented by dr, triplings by tr, compound types by combinations of these. 8 ‚Äì Open doublings above \\"D\\" are represented by dir, such as dirie, where the note is doubled by itself, and the note above it. Dr represents closed doublings, and dir open doublings. Grace note forms defined Grace note forms consist of single, double, and compound: *The single group includes all simple forms, together with the \\"d√†-lugh\\" variation form. *The double group includes the single and double types of \\"tr√¨-lugh\\" and \\"ceithir-lugh\\". *The single type of \\"tr√¨-lugh\\" is composed of three \\"low A\\"s graced by \\"G\\", \\"D\\" and \\"E\\" gracenotes, and it precedes the note embellished. An example of this is \\"hininindo\\", the syllable do being \\"C\\" graced by \\"D\\". This type is called \\"fosgailte\\" (open), and is opposed by the double or closed form, represented by such a form as hindirinto. The latter is called \\"a-steach\\" (inside), which is taken to a type like hodorito, which is said to be \\"a-mach\\" (outside), as the grips are taken from the note played. The types last named are also \\"breabach\\" (kicking) forms, having a \\"kick‚Äù note at the finish. The \\"cr√πn-lugh\\" or \\"ceithir-lugh\\" forms are also \\"fosgailte\\", \\"a-mach\\" and \\"a-steach\\". The word hadatri is \\"a-steach\\" when opposed to \\"hadatri\\" which is \\"a-mach\\". Hiodratatiriri is a pure \\"cliabh-lugh\\"‚Äîthe chest or creel of fingers, because every finger on the chanter is engaged in some way, either acting or acted on. In bagpipe music, the variations are all named from the acting fingers, and the old pipers counted their time from the number of fingers engaged in the several parts of the tune. Chin-drine may be taken as an example of the \\"leum-lugh\\", the jump of the fingers. This is \\"low A\\", played by \\"D\\" grace note, then \\"G\\" doubled by \\"D\\", \\"low A\\" then opened, and \\"F\\" rapidly opened from it. Hiriri is an example of a beat form. The playing of two \\"low A\\"s by touching \\"low G\\" twice with the little finger is ririn, or rurin. The prosodic quality of the syllables, together with the spacing and punctuation, give the time and rhythm of the tunes.

In the context of the oracle bones of ancient China, which chiefly utilized both scapulae and the plastrons of turtle, scapulimancy is sometimes used in a very broad sense to jointly refer to both scapulimancy and plastromancy (similar divination using plastrons). However, the term osteomancy might be more appropriate, referring to divination using bones. Many archaeological sites along the south coast and offlying islands of the Korean peninsula show that deer and pig scapulae were used in divination during the Korean Protohistoric Period, c. 300 BC - AD 300/400. Historically, scapulimancy has taken two major forms. In the first, \\"apyromantic\\", the scapula of an animal was simply examined after its slaughter. This form was widespread in Europe, Northern Africa and the Near East. However, the second form, \\"pyromantic\\" scapulimancy, involving the heating or burning of the bone and interpretation of the results, was practiced in East Asia and North America. Scapulimancy was also mentioned in Chapter 5 of the Kojiki, the Japanese Record of Ancient Matters, in which the heavenly deities used this process of divination during a consultation by lesser gods. It is also a method of divination among Greek and Serb farmers, even today. It is probably of extremely ancient origin. More recently, references are found in the memoirs of several warriors who fought during the Greek War of Independence. Whenever they had a feast, they used to roast lambs or kids, and after the meal, anyone who knew how to \\"read\\" the scapula would clean it of any remaining flesh and, lifting it up to the light, would interpret the various shadowy bits showing on the transparent part of the bone. A clear scapula was a good omen. Shadowy bits had their interpretation and by this they used to predict the outcome of a battle on the morrow, death or survival. In Renaissance magic, scapulimancy (known as \\"spatulamancy\\") was classified as one of the seven \\"forbidden arts,\\" along with necromancy, geomancy, aeromancy, pyromancy, chiromancy (palmistry), and hydromancy.Johannes Hartlieb (Munich, 1456) The Book of All Forbidden Arts; quoted in L√°ng, p. 124.

During the over four months that passed until he revealed his identity, the mysterious story spawned media attention and speculation across the world and dubbed him the Piano Man. When Grassl was picked up by police on 7 April 2005, he was wandering the streets in Sheerness, Kent, in England, wearing a soaking wet suit and tie, and he did not answer any questions. Remaining silent, he was presented a pen and paper by Medway Maritime Hospital staff in the hope he would write his name. Instead, he drew a detailed sketch of a grand piano. When they first brought him to a piano, he reportedly played music from various genres (ranging from classical music by Tchaikovsky to pop music by the Beatles) non-stop for four hours, and then was taken away by the hospital staff.  Tracing the 'Piano Man'  For several months, Grassl was interned in a secure mental health unit in north Kent while he was being treated and evaluated. Interpreters were unable to discover his origin. Orchestras around Europe were contacted in a bid to trace his identity. The West Kent NHS and Social Care Trust, and the local police received what they described as an \\"overwhelming\\" public response, receiving over 800 calls on a dedicated helpline. The story was broken when a social worker contacted the Daily Mail for help. A local photographer named Mike Gunnill was commissioned by the social worker to photograph Grassl. This proved difficult at first but in the end Gunnill managed to photograph Grassl when he took his usual daily walk around the hospital grounds. The social worker also gave the photographer the \\"mystery man's\\" sketch book. The only sketch worth copying was a large image of a grand piano. The rest of the book were just lines and doodles. Despite later comments, there was no flag image in the book. From the sketch of the grand piano, the Daily Mail started calling him \\"piano man\\". Despite having the story first, the Daily Mail did not use it until later. Executives at Associated Newspapers thought he might be an \\"asylum seeker\\" who had arrived in Kent. Two weeks later, the photographer was told the story would not be used by the Daily Mail and he was free to use the images as he wished. The Mail on Sunday used a small image on the front page, but this was removed after the first three editions. Nevertheless, it was enough to start a media storm over \\"Piano Man\\". Grassl's picture was posted on the UK charity Missing People's website (formerly the National Missing Persons Helpline). On 18 May 2005, a Polish man working as a mime artist in Rome approached Italian police officers, believing the Piano Man to be a French busker called Steven Villa Masson. However, the British newspaper The Independent tracked down Masson to his home in France, thus ruling out this lead. Italian television stations showed footage of a concert pianist with a resemblance to the Piano Man--the pictures were filmed at an instrument fair in Rimini five years earlier. Observers found his hair different, but his nose and facial structure very similar. He had also stayed silent. British tabloids also suggested a link to a man last seen in Canada two years previously, Sywald Skeid (then known as Philip Staufen), who had wandered into a Toronto emergency department apparently suffering from amnesia. His true identity was revealed in a GQ magazin article as in fact Sywald Skeid. BBC News reported on 29 May 2005 that a Czech musician called Klaudius Kry≈°p√≠n, the drummer of a Czech rock band Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr (\\"Prague Selection\\"), had rung the helpline, offering information that Piano Man might be a pianist called Tom√°≈° Strnad, who along with Kry≈°p√≠n was a member of the tribute band Ropotamo in the 1980s. Also, Klaudius Kry≈°p√≠n's twin brother Richard who lives in Columbus, Ohio, United States, confirmed that Piano Man had a striking resemblance to Strnad. Another person who argued that Strnad might have been Piano Man was Michael Koc√°b, the singer of Pra≈æsk√Ω v√Ωbƒõr and a former adviser of V√°clav Havel. A problem with this theory was that Koc√°b said that he met Strnad on 10 April 2005 near Prague (three days after the Piano Man was found in England). Even though the West Kent NHS Trust described this as a \\"promising lead\\" and reportedly planned to bring in a Czech interpreter, this theory was dashed when Tom√°≈° Strnad was found and interviewed on Czech TV. On 3 June 2005, Dateline NBC, the American NBC network's investigative news magazine, featured the story of the Piano Man as its top story. On 24 June 2005, Susanne Schlippe-Steffensen (Dansk Folkeparti), a local council member of the Danish municipality of Karlebo, near Copenhagen, made a claim on Danish TV 2/Lorry, that the Piano Man was in fact her Algerian-born husband. Steffensen had not seen her husband since February, when he had travelled to Algeria to visit his sick mother. \\"He has lost 20 kilos and bleached his hair, but I can see in his eyes that it is him. I will never be wrong when I see those eyes\\", she said to TV 2/Lorry. Steffensen's theory was that her husband had travelled to England due to a conflict with his family. According to Steffensen the family was unhappy with the fact that he was married to a western woman. \\"I think he has fled for his life. He has previously received death threats\\", said Steffensen. She went to England to meet her claimed husband, but according to Steffensen the hospital did not allow her to meet him. On 2 July 2005, BBC News reported that the Piano Man, when shown a map, pointed to Oslo, the capital of Norway. A Norwegian-speaking person was brought in to open communications. According to the report the Piano Man seemed more responsive when Norwegian was spoken even though he remained unable or unwilling to speak. The theory was further strengthened by claims that a Norwegian vessel was in the area at the time the man was discovered. According to media reports, the Piano Man also made a drawing of the Swedish flag after coming to the hospital. This led to speculation that he had lived in one of the Scandinavian countries. Between 4 July and 6 July, students from Norway said they knew the man in question as an exchange student from Ireland. These beliefs and possible leads were dashed when Norwegian papers were able to contact the man who the Piano Man was thought to be. Diagnoses Diagnoses of his condition initially focused on post-traumatic stress disorder but it was at the time thought he might be an autistic savant. Autistic savants can display extraordinary but highly specific talents, while at the same time remaining withdrawn or uncommunicative to the point of constant silence. The trust refused to officially comment on the young man's treatment beyond saying that his physical health remained good, but it was understood he was showing increasing signs of a rapport with a small number of trusted caregivers.  Return to Germany  On 22 August, the British tabloid newspaper the Daily Mirror reported that the Piano Man had finally broken his silence after more than four months, and that he had been exposed as a hoax. Additionally, the Mirrors source said that he did not play the piano properly, but \\"just kept tapping one key continuously\\". Hospital staff have maintained that his abilities were not exaggerated. The Mirror article said that the Piano Man had told the medical staff that he was a gay German man, who had come to Britain on a Eurostar train after losing his job in Paris. According to the newspaper's source, the man said that he had been planning to commit suicide when he was discovered on the beach in Sheerness, that he did not talk to the police due to his distressed state, and that he then continued to act mute. The unnamed source also suggested that the Piano Man used to work with the mentally ill, and thus was able to mimic their behaviour, thereby fooling the hospital staff. According to the tabloids, he has been flown back to Germany where his father (a farmer) and his two sisters live. Later the same day the BBC reported that the German foreign ministry had confirmed that the man was a 20-year-old Bavarian who had flown home on 20 August. The German embassy in London confirmed that they had been contacted by the Little Brook Hospital, confirmed the man's identity and provided him with replacement travel documents. Following the media reports, the West Kent NHS and Social Care Trust issued a statement stating that the man was no longer in the care of the trust, that he had been \\"discharged from [their] care following a marked improvement in his condition\\", and that their \\"involvement with this man has now ceased and will not be resuming at any stage\\". The statement also expressed that no further information was to be released. In a follow-up to the story on 24 August, the Daily Mirror named the man as Andreas Grassl and published an interview with his parents, farmers in Prosdorf, a village belonging to Waldm√ºnchen in the Cham district of the Upper Palatinate in eastern Bavaria. According to the interview, their son had upon his return told them that he had \\"no idea what happened to me. I just suddenly woke up and realised who I was.\\" Grassl's father expressed anger with some allegations made in the original Mirror article, in particular the suggestions that his son's behaviour during treatment was not genuine. \\"I know he would never make something like this up,\\" the father said. He denied that his son was gay, and told the newspaper that his son in fact was an accomplished piano player, albeit not to a professional standard. Grassl's lawyer said he might have experienced a psychotic episode. After working with disabled people in Saarbr√ºcken, Grassl apparently told his parents that he intended to leave to study in France. After that, his parents had not been able to reach him. They had reported him missing, but they did not see nor recognize the pictures of their son that were distributed around the world. Friends of Grassl told The Times that he had spent hours in internet chat rooms, where he was known as \\"Scatman\\", and that he was a columnist for a local newspaper, writing about pop music. In October 2014, AllthePigs Theatre Company announced that they were writing a play based on the theories and events that led to the 'Piano Man' at the New Diorama in London.https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/24/piano-man-play- allthepigs-theatre-company] References External links =News reports prior to identification= * Aftenposten: \\"Ex-students recognize \\"Piano Man'\\" * CNN: Silent 'piano man' baffles medics * The Globe and Mail: Piano player man of mystery * BBC: 'Piano Mayged in Italy? * Doctors fear mute 'Piano Man' will never be identified. * Guardian: Do you know this man?

History Modern restaurants date to back to eighteenth century France. By the early nineteenth century, they had been introduced in America. In the late 1800s, restaurants began using theming to differentiate themselves from increasing competition.

According to the saga, Faravid made an alliance with the Norwegian Thorolf Kveldulfsson to fight against Karelian invaders. Dating of the encounter The surviving version of the saga was written only in 1240, with possible later influences. The saga mentions Faravid in a 9th-century context, but this is thought to be by Ky√∂sti Julku and Mikko H√§me too early to be credible as far as the Karelian attack is concerned. It is more likely that such encounter with Kvens and Karelians would have taken place in the 12th century.Mikko H√§me, Egilin saagan lapinkuvauksen ajoituksesta, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 3/79, p. 79 Karelians only became active in Lapland in the 11th century onwards. However, prof. Unto Salo states that it is possible to time the description to the beginning of the 11th century.Unto Salo, Ajan ammoisen oloista, Satakunnan ja naapurimaakuntien esihistoriaa, Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008, p. 263 Furthermore, on the same raid Thorolf hears that the Kylfings, who might be Novgorodians, are harassing the Sami. Thorolf proceeds to look for the kylfings slays 30 Kylfings that he finds. Unto Salo notes that the Novgorodian annals mention that Novgorod made a raid to Tavastia in 1042. This could have been a revenge for the attacks on the Kylfings and the Karelians.Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 27/2003, p. 35 Saga's description of the encounter In the saga Thorolf goes to Finnmark in the winter with hundred men and meets \\"in the far east\\" with some Kvens that state they have been sent by their king Faravid. They tell Thorolf that the Karelians (Kiriales) are harassing their land. The king's message to Thorolf was that this should bear him help. Thorolf would have a share of the booty equal to the king's share, and each of his men as much as two Kvens. \\"With the Kvens the law was that the king should have one- third as compared with his men when the booty was shared, and beyond that, as reserved for him, all bearskins and sables. Thorolf put this proposal before his men, giving them the choice to go or not; and the more part chose to venture it, as the prize was so great. Thus it was decided that they should go eastwards with the messengers.\\"http://sagadb.org/egils_saga.en Thorolf makes a pact with Faravid and they attack Karelia together with three hundred of the king's men and hundred Norsemen (or, if a hundare is 120 men, 360 and 120, respectively). According to the saga they went by the \\"upper way\\" over Finnmark, and found the Karelians . These were the same ones who had before harried the Kvens. The Karelians formed for battle and faced to meet the Kvens and the Norsemen, expecting a victory as before. But when the battle started, the Norsemen charged, having stronger bearing shields than those of the Kvens (and Karelians?). Many Karelians fell, and the rest fled. King Faravid and Thorolf gained a great victory and won much spoil, and returned to Kvenland. Afterwards Thorolf and his men came to Finmark, parting in friendship from Faravid and Kvens. Next winter Thorolf passed over the Keel mountains again with hundred men, went eastwards to Kvenland and met king Faravid. They took counsel together, and decided to go as in the winter before. With four hundred men they descended on Karelia (Kirialaland), and attacked those districts. Karelians matched the Kvens and the Norsemen in numbers. They took much booty, returning up to Finmark as the winter wore on. Historicity of Faravid Egil's saga does not offer any details on Faravid. Only that he is the king of Kvenland and that he commands a troop of three hundare, perhaps 360 men, if the Kvens followed the tradition of Eastern Sweden.Lepp√§aho The saga naturally emphasises the role of the Norsemen in the raid and the battle but it is clear that the expedition was common.Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 27/2003, p. 34 That Faravid was a \\"king\\" does not mean that he was necessarily a king of some realm but it does indicate that he was a chief comparable to a petty king, commanding his own troops.Unto Salo, Ajan ammoisen oloista, Satakunnan ja naapurimaakuntien esihistoriaa, Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008, p. 273 The name Faravid is a Norse name, not Finnic, even though Kvens are generally thought to be Finnic. However, Faravid does not appear as a name in Scandinavia and it has been seen as a translation of Finnish \\"Kaukomieli\\" or \\"Kaukamoinen\\".Unto Salo, Ajan ammoisen oloista, Satakunnan ja naapurimaakuntien esihistoriaa, Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008, p. 276 Kaukomieli is also one of the names for the character of Lemmink√§inen in the Kalevala, and Lemmink√§inen himself is an amalgam of three folk poem heroes, Lemmink√§inen, Kaukomieli and Ahti Saarelainen. The name Kaukomieli has been interpreted to mean \\"far traveler\\" or \\"far longing\\".Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 27/2003, p. 47 Satakunta region in Finland, where Kvenland has commonly been situated by research, along with Southern Ostrobothnia, has many village names starting with Kauko-. These can be dated to be either late Iron Age or early middle age villages and thus would fit the timing of the saga's description of Faravid.Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 27/2003, p. 51 Furthermore, the municipality of K√∂yli√∂ has an example of \\"Kaukamely\\" used as a surname from a document dated 1422.Unto Salo, Ajan ammoisen oloista, Satakunnan ja naapurimaakuntien esihistoriaa, Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008, p. 279 K√∂yli√∂ has rich Iron Age cemeteries and clearly was one of the centres of pre- historic Finland. For example, a burial dated to 1025-1150 in K√∂yli√∂'s C-burial ground (also known as \\"Lalli cemetery\\"), on the island in K√∂yli√∂nj√§rvi, includes a sword with silver plated hilt, silver decorated axe, two spear heads and a silver ring, among other items.Unto Salo, Ajan ammoisen oloista, Satakunnan ja naapurimaakuntien esihistoriaa, Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura 2008, p. 282 Next to the island where the burial ground is situated, there is a smaller island of Kaukoluoto, which is thought to derive its name from the personal name of Kauko.Unto Salo, Faravidin retket ja Satakunnan organisoituminen, in Faravid Pohjois-Suomen historiallisen yhdistyksen vuosikirja, 27/2003, p. 52 The burials in K√∂yli√∂'s C-burial ground are among the richest known in Finland.Pirkko-Liisa Lehtosalo-Hilander, Kalastajista Kauppanaisiin (Euran esihistoria, Rauma 2000), p. 277 Thus, it is possible that Faravid (even though this might have not been his real name) was a real chief in the region today known as Finland although there is no other mention of him.

The battle was fought between the exiled King of Sweden Sverker and the ruling King Eric X. Sverker had been beaten in the previous Battle of Lena, but returned with new forces. Sverker was however killed in the battle. The exact strength of the armies is unknown. Background Sverker II had grown up in exile in Denmark and was accepted as king in 1195/96, to the detriment of the four sons of the previous King Canute I. He pursued a policy of strengthening the clerical estate, but ran into difficulties after twelve years of reign. The sole surviving son of Canute, Eric, was backed by the Birkebeiner party of Norway and ousted Sverker in 1207-08. Sverker sought assistance from King Valdemar the Victorious of Denmark and his powerful Danish in-laws. With a strong army he entered V√§sterg√∂tland in early 1208 but suffered a crushing defeat in the Battle of Lena. A very large part of the Danish army fell on the battlefield. Among the few survivors was Sverker himself who returned to Denmark. A later folksong emphasizes his determination and fatalism in the face of the disaster: : My father is slain through falsity and treachery, : And if I shall flee the land, : It will badly befall the Uppland peasantry, : And their followers at hand. : : I will terminate my young life, : And my blood and spirit spill, : Before I renounce the royal name, : And to my enemies yield at will.A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm; H√∂rbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 236. Pope Innocent III, impressed by Sverker's pro-papal policy, ordered Eric to settle the conflict with Sverker, or else take serious consequences. However, his admonitions did not have the desired effect. A new expedition was therefore equipped in Denmark in order to recapture the Swedish throne. The battle In the summer of 1210, Sverker once again invaded the Swedish kingdom where Eric had meanwhile adopted royal titles. The army came to a place called Gestilren where it was confronted by Eric's troops on 17 July (alternatively, 16 August). The available details about the battle are utterly meagre. The short chronicle of the Westrogothic law says that \\"the Folkungs took his life; his own brother-in-law did it to him in Gestilren\\".Mats G. Larsson, G√∂tarnas riken: Uppt√§cktsf√§rder till Sveriges enande. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 185. An annal entry informs us of \\"warfare in Gestilren, on the 16th of August; there fell King Sverker and Folke Jarl, and many Folkungs.\\"Philip Line, Kingship and state formation in Sweden 1130-1290. Leiden: Brill, 2007, p. 143. Thus the Swedish troops scored a victory in spite of great losses where one of their commanders, Folke Jarl, was slain. With the dramatic fall of Sverker, the war that had plagued Sweden for two and a half years came to an end, and peace was quickly concluded with Denmark. The banner that King Eric used in the battle was later bequeathed to Folke Jarl's nephew Eskil Magnusson, the lawspeaker of V√§sterg√∂tland, and bestowed on the Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson in 1219.Erik L√∂nnroth, Fr√•n svensk medeltid. Stockholm: Aldus, 1964, p. 16-7. The battle was a victory for the Folkung party of local autonomies, who acted against the centralising forces of Catholic monarchy. Sverker's nemesis Folke Jarl was probably a son of the powerful Jarl Birger Brosa (d. 1202) and the uncle of Birger Jarl, whose descendants ruled Sweden after 1250. If so, he was indeed a brother-in-law of Sverker. In early-modern historiography the royal branch of the clan was also called \\"Folkungs\\" which seems to be incorrect. The name may originally have alluded to the supporters of Folke Jarl at Gestilren, but then became the denomination for a party or faction. The party frequently opposed royal rule until they were defeated at the Battle of Sparrs√§tra in 1247, finally disappearing in c. 1280.Erik L√∂nnroth, Fr√•n svensk medeltid. Stockholm: Aldus, 1964. The Gestilren problem The location where this battle took place is the subject of a very long and very heated discussion between Swedish historians. Traditionally, the location was believed to be in V√§sterg√∂tland, where a monument () was erected in 1910 to commemorate the seven centuries since the battle. The main reason for the localization is a note in a 15th- century codex of the Westrogothic law, which says that the battle took place \\"in Gaestilsreen between Dala and Lena\\".A.M. Strinnholm, Svenska folkets historia, Vol. IV. Stockholm; H√∂rbergska Boktryckeriet, 1852, p. 238. The information implies that the field of slaughter was close to the scene of the 1208 battle. Historian Erik L√∂nnroth has argued that fighting took place \\"in or close to the gorge between the Gerum Hill and the Varv Hill, since the only way to confront heavy, superior, feudal cavalry, was when it was impossible to surround you on the flanks, instead forming a stable spear formation against them\\".Extensive study about Lena and Gestilren by Stig Lundberg, http://stiglundberg.org/lena-och-gestilren/a/ Others have argued that the battle took place in √ñsterg√∂tland, or that Gestilren should not be interpreted as a place name at all.Extensive study about Lena and Gestilren by Stig Lundberg, http://stiglundberg.org/lena-och-gestilren/a/ Recently, archivist and historian Lars-Otto Berg has claimed that it was located at G√§stre () in Uppland, Sweden, since he found the farm name \\"Gestilren\\" fifteen times in the local church records during the years 1580-1630. This is also close to the strongholds of the Folkung party. An annotation from the early 17th century records a local tradition suggesting a connection: \\"King Sverker's three farms - in Tillinge Hiersten, in F√∂rsth. Gestilren, in Biskull Landzberg - he was buried in Gestilren in the Sverker Hill\\".Sven Sandblom, Gestilren 1210. Striden stod i Uppland! I G√§stre. Enk√∂ping: Enk√∂pings kommun, 2004, p. 24-5.

The lane used for overtaking another vehicle is almost always a passing lane further from the road shoulder which is to the left in places that drive on the right and to the right in places that drive on the left. Rules of overtaking =In English-speaking countries= On a single-carriageway/undivided-carriageway road, the lane used for overtaking is often the same lane that is used by oncoming traffic. An overtaking vehicle must be able to see clearly ahead of them for the entire overtaking manoeuvre plus a margin of error. For example, in New Zealand it's instructed in the Road Code that an overtaking driver must be able to see at least 100 metres of clear road in front of them as they finish the passing manoeuvre). In the UK, guidance for passing and overtaking is given in rules 162-169 of the Highway Code. In some jurisdictions, the \\"overtaking zone\\" is indicated by a single broken centerline (yellow or white in most countries) if overtaking is allowed in either direction, or paired with a single solid line beside it to indicate there is no overtaking from the solid side. In the UK and New Zealand, the format of the centerline is not used to regulate overtaking, only to indicate whether crossing of the line is prohibited or permitted. In Australia, drivers can cross a solid centreline to overtake a cyclist. In the Republic of Ireland, many national primary roads were upgraded in the 1990s and 2000s to wide two-lane road (two-lane road with space for three lanes, in addition to hard shoulders) to allow more space for overtaking (a very common manoeuvre in a country that had little dual carriageway until the early 2000s). However, due to the deceptive perception of safety given by such roads, future upgrade projects are likely to be 2+1 road where traffic volume suits (a successful pilot installation was used on the N20 near Mallow, County Cork). This form of road is of similar profile to wide two-lane, but includes a central crash barrier, and has three lanes, with an overtaking lane on one side or the other, alternating every 2 km. It has been used in Denmark and Sweden since the 1990s. On a dual-carriageway/divided-carriageway highway/motorway or arterial road, any lane can be an overtaking lane though in many places (including Germany) undertaking (overtaking on the side furthest from the road centre line) is prohibited. Lanes are normally separated by broken lines (usually white) but may be a single solid white to indicate lane-changing is allowed but discouraged. Double lines indicate that lane-changing (for example to overtake) is prohibited, such as in tunnels or sometimes for HOV lanes and HOT lanes. Overtaking in an HOV or HOT lane is usually illegal for cars that do not meet the HOV/HOT criteria, except when directed by the police. A few places also use the one-broken/one-solid marking at slip roads/entrance ramps, to indicate to highway drivers that the new lane merges and does not continue, so they do not attempt to overtake in a lane that ends shortly. This is also used at other points where lanes merge. =In other countries= The no- overtaking-sign looks a lot the same in most European countries, but its legal description differs between countries. Depending on the text of law, in some countries in Europe the no-overtaking-sign bans overtaking only for vehicles that have three or more wheels, effectively granting motorcycle drivers the freedom to overtake cars even past the no-overtaking-sign, where the same sign rules out overtaking for all types of vehicles in neighboring countries. In other jurisdictions, like the Netherlands, overtaking vehicles that have only 2 wheels is not forbidden, despite the no-overtaking sign. The law text 'overtaking vehicles on more than two wheels' allows for overtaking bicycles, of which there are many on Dutch roads. Nationwide ban on overtaking as road safety measure The Netherlands has ruled out overtaking on 95% of their single carriageway primary road network. Statistics from before 1990 showed that many fatal accidents in the Netherlands were due to unsafe overtaking actions, where the speed of oncoming traffic was underestimated. During the 1990s a new road design was introduced, called 'Duurzaam Veilig' (Sustainable Safety). Sustainable Safety, English pages of Dutch website about the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project retrieved 15 December 2019 The philosophy behind the new road design was that the road had to protect its users against death or injury, by creating a design that has to eliminate common mistakes that often lead to accidents.

The idea behind the solid centre line was the thought that overtaking cars have to move into lanes with oncoming traffic, which was considered unsafe even on perfectly flat and straight stretches of road with proper visibility. People in favour of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project point out that it has succeeded in creating more safety, as the number of fatal accidents has gone down quite dramatically as 'Duurzaam Veilig' road design was rolled out across the Netherlands.Ten years of Sustainable Safety in the Netherlands; An assessment published by Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Verkeersveiligheid (SWOV), Foundation for scientific research on traffic safety, retrieved 15 December 2019 Critics of the Dutch Sustainable Safety project complain that an overly safe road design has robbed Dutch drivers of their ability to think independently and correctly estimate when it is safe to overtake. Other critics point out that the idea behind the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project, that all traffic on Dutch distributor roads (GOW) would move at the same speed of 80 km/h is barely a theory. In everyday life on Dutch regional GOW-roads there are quite a few (elderly or insecure) people moving at 60 or 70 km/h, thereby annoying drivers who want to drive the legal speed limit of 80 km/h or slightly over it. Some critics even go as far as saying that the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project has raised aggression amongst frustrated drivers on Dutch roads, as it has robbed drivers from their freedom to legally overtake slower moving traffic. Haters of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project also point out that, as the double solid centre line gets largely ignored by faster drivers who overtake anyway, it is actually dangerous that drivers nowadays are taking an uninterrupted centre line on a Dutch regional GOW-road less serious than they would back in the days when solid lines would only be applied on dangerous spots.Asstreep, Centre axis line, article on Wegenwiki, Dutch website about roads, retrieved 15 December 2019 Opinions of critics of the 'Duurzaam Veilig'-project are mostly discussed at truck stops and on internet forums,Duurzaam Veilig; systeemdiscussie (Sustainable Safety project, systematic discussion) discussion thread on Wegenforum, where professionals in road design, road builders, maintenance crew and people who consider roads as their hobby have mostly serious discussions, retrieved 15th of December 2019 in Dutch language, far away from decision-makers who proudly promote the Dutch Sustainable Safety project in English, to the rest of the world. =Vienna Convention on Road Traffic= In countries bounded by Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, article 11 states that: * Drivers overtaking shall do so on the side opposite to that appropriate to the direction of traffic. * Drivers should check the following driver is not overtaking them, drivers ahead have not warned of their intention to overtake, the lane is clear far enough ahead, and the lane is available to continue driving once the overtaking manoeuver is completed. * overtaking on two-way carriageways might be forbidden according to the nearness of the crest of a hill or the longitudinal road markings * the width of the road should be sufficient * Overtaking is usually forbidden in crossing * Overtaking is usually forbidden where a pedestrian crossing is marked on the carriageway * The one who is overtaken should refrain from accelerating. Local governments may introduce variations to the Convention. Overtaking on the inside Overtaking on the inside or undertakingInside refers to the edge of the road closest to the kerb and outside closest to the centre.Never undertake a Heavy Goods Vehicle refers to the practice of overtaking a slower vehicle on a road using the lane that is curb side of the vehicle being passed; that is to say, a lane to the left of the vehicle in countries where driving is on the left, or a lane to the right of the vehicle in countries where driving is on the right. The practice of passing on the inside, therefore, usually only occurs on a motorway or other road where there is more than one lane in the same direction or when the width of the roads makes this possible (although there may be exceptions in the cases of contraflow bus lanes). Many countries consider overtaking on the inside dangerous and therefore designate it a driving offence, however, most countries make the distinction between involuntary undertaking (passing centre side vehicles in heavy traffic) as opposed to the deliberate attempt to pass a slower moving vehicle for one's own benefit. =Legal status by country= * Australia and New Zealand Undertaking is legal on multi-lane roads, or where a car is indicating to turn right.Drive Safe Handbook page 75 * Canada Varies by province. * Denmark Undertaking is specifically prohibited, unless passing a vehicle clearly turning left or riding a bicycle or small moped. However, drivers may pass other vehicles to the right in certain circumstances; these include heavy traffic where the speed is determined by the next vehicle and vehicles in reserved lanes. * Finland Undertaking is specifically prohibited, except for inner-city traffic and vehicle waiting to turn left or on the motorway if the vehicles in the lane to the left are queueing and slow moving. * France Undertaking is specifically prohibited, except for vehicle waiting to turn left or if the vehicles in the lane to the left are queueing and slow moving. * Germany Undertaking is specifically prohibited, exceptions exist for inner- city traffic and overtaking trams and vehicles waiting to turn left. * Hungary Undertaking is prohibited outside built-up areas. Inside built-up areas, passing on the right is permitted, but only if there are road markings. The undertaking manoeuvre in built-up areas is referred to as \\"driving in parallel traffic\\" instead of \\"passing on the right\\" as it is used outside built-up areas. * Ireland Undertaking permitted in three prescribed cases: 1) You want to go straight ahead when the driver in front of you has moved out and signalled that they intend to turn right. 2) You have signalled that you intend to turn left, 3) Traffic in both lanes is moving slowly but traffic in the left-hand lane is moving more quickly than the right-hand lane ‚Äì for example, in slow moving stop/start traffic conditions. * Netherlands Undertaking is specifically prohibited, exceptions include vehicles waiting to turn left, traffic congestion and on roundabouts. * Poland Undertaking is legal on 4-lane roads in built-up areas, 6-lane roads outside built-up areas and on one-way roads with marked lanes (this definition includes motorways). (article 24 of Law on Road Traffic) However, similar to the UK it is considered a dangerous practice and is discouraged. * Spain Undertaking is specifically prohibited, except for inner-city traffic, passing a vehicle clearly turning left or in congested conditions. * United Kingdom The Highway Code discourages undertaking on motorways with some exceptions (rule 268): \\"Do not overtake on the left or move to a lane on your left to overtake\\". Undertaking is permitted in congested conditions when frequent lane changing is not recommended.The Highway Code - Motorways On other roads, the Code advises drivers \\"should only overtake on the left if the vehicle in front is signalling to turn right\\" (rule 163).The Highway Code - Overtaking Rule 163 uses advisory wording and \\"will not, in itself, cause a person to be prosecuted\\", but may be used in evidence to establishing liability in any court proceedings.The Highway Code - Introduction On all roads, undertaking is permitted if the vehicles in the lane to the right are queueing and slow moving. Undertaking in an aggressive or reckless manner could be considered Careless Driving or more seriously Dangerous Driving, both of which are legally enforceable offences. * United States Undertaking is typically allowed on multi-lane roadways or to pass left-turning vehicles.California Vehicle Code ¬ß 21754Code of Virginia ¬ß 46.2-841Utah Code ¬ß 41-6a-705New York State Law Title VII Article 25 Section 1123South Dakota Code ¬ß 32-26-27 State laws can vary as to the situations that permit undertaking.

After research in secret Soviet archives (both before and after the dissolution of the union), he published biographies of Joseph Stalin and Vladimir Lenin, among others. Despite being a committed Stalinist and Marxist‚ÄìLeninist ideologue for most of his career, Volkogonov came to repudiate communism and the Soviet system within the last decade of his life before his death from cancer in 1995. Through his research in the restricted archives of the Soviet Central Committee, Volkogonov discovered facts that contradicted the official Soviet version of events, and the cult of personality that had been built up around Lenin and Stalin. Volkogonov published books that contributed to the strain of liberal Russian thought that emerged during Glasnost in the late 1980s and the post-Soviet era of the early 1990s. Early life Volkogonov was born March 22, 1928 in Chita, Eastern Siberia. Volkogonov was the son of a collective farm manager and a schoolteacher. In 1937, when he was eight, Volkogonov's father was arrested and shot during Stalin's purges for being found in possession of a pamphlet by Bukharin. This was something Volkogonov only found out years later while doing his own research in the restricted archives in Moscow. His mother was sent to a labor camp, where she died during World War II. The family was \\"exiled to Krasnoyarsk in Western Siberia: Volkogonov joked that as they were already in the Far East, and Stalin was not in the habit of sending his political prisoners to Hawaii, they had to be sent west.\\" Volkogonov entered the military at the age of seventeen in 1945, which was common for many orphans. He studied at the Lenin Military-Political Academy in Moscow in 1961, transferring to the Soviet Army's propaganda department in 1970. There he wrote propaganda pamphlets and manuals on psychological warfare and gained a reputation as a hardliner. It was as early as the 1950s, while a young Army officer, that Volkogonov first discovered information that created cognitive dissonance within himself. While reading early journals of Party members from the 1920s, Volkogonov realized \\"how stifled and sterile political debate in the Soviet Union had become in comparison to the early days.\\" Khrushchev's 1956 secret speech further solidified this thought within him, but he kept these thoughts to himself at that time. During the decades that Volkogonov headed the Department of Special Propaganda, he visited Angola, Ethiopia, the Middle East and Afghanistan. He \\"enjoyed a rapid rise in the Soviet Army as a specialist in charge of psychological and ideological warfare. Only a fully committed Communist could qualify for these posts, and he earned his credentials by grinding out propagandistic and agitational screeds.\\" \\"But even as he was indoctrinating troops in Communist orthodoxy, General Volkogonov was struggling with private doubts based on the horrors he discovered hidden in the archives\\". Volkogonov also had the opportunity to view the conditions of various client states during the Cold War. While these countries received military aid, Volkogonov later recalled, \\"...they all became poorer; their economies were collapsing everywhere. And I came to the conclusion that the Marxist model was a real historic blind alley, and that we, too, were caught in a historic trap.\\" Researching Stalin Volkogonov was a fervent ideologue until the end of the 1970s, and devoted his energy to spreading Marxism‚ÄìLeninism within the military. Only with the most impeccable communist credentials did Volkogonov access the most secret Soviet archives. While reading in the archives during the Brezhnev years, Volkogonov \\"found documents that astounded him ‚Äî papers that revealed top Communists as cruel, dishonest and inept\\". Thus, while Volkogonov was actively writing and editing Soviet propaganda materials for troops, \\"[he] was engaged in a lengthy, tortured but very private process of re-evaluating Soviet history.\\" Volkogonov began writing the biography of Stalin in 1978. He completed it by 1983, but it was banned by the Central Committee. It was published under Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of Glasnost before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The publication of the book on Stalin within Russia made Volkogonov \\"a pariah among his fellow senior officers\\". Although Volkogonov approached Lenin in the Stalin biography in a rather conventional way, he was passionate in his indictment of the Stalinist system. As he later remarked, \\"It immediately made me many enemies.\\" \\"Volkogonov admitted publicly that, like many senior Soviet officials, he had lived two mental lives, rising higher and higher in his career while burrowing deeper in the archives, as if symbolically undermining the system that had nurtured him.\\" He had been director of the Institute of Military History since 1985, where he was heavily involved in research and writing. While there, Volkogonov compiled a two-volume collection of data on 45,000 Red Army officers who were arrested during the purges of the 1930s, in which 15,000 were shot. While the Stalin biography caused friction, everything really came to a head in June 1991, when he was forced to resign. Volkogonov had shown the other senior officers at the Institute a draft of the first volume of a 10-volume official Soviet history of World War II. In it, Volkogonov criticized Stalin's management of the war and his liquidation of Soviet officers. One British historian, summarizing Volkogonov's criticisms of Stalin's military role in World War II, then notes that \\"a number of officers at the Institute of Military History who had fought on the Eastern Front were critical of Volkogonov's writings on the war because he had never set foot on a battlefield. He was, they said, an 'armchair-general'.\\"Albert Axell, Russia's Heroes, 1941-45; 2001:248. \\"Accused of blackening the name of the army, as well as that of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, and personally attacked by Minister of Defense Yazov,\\" and under pressure from Gorbachev, Volkogonov resigned. 1990s After the failed 1991 Soviet coup d'√©tat attempt by communist hardliners in August 1991, followed by the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991, Volkogonov became the special adviser for defence issues to the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. In the early 1990s, Volkogonov was \\"the chairman of the commission investigating the hitherto unknown fates of allied prisoners of war in Soviet camps, chairman of the parliamentary committee for KGB and Communist Party archives.\\"Mark Champion, \\"Volkogonov Rediscovers Lenin\\", Moscow Times, October 12, 1992, at http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/volkogonov- rediscovers-lenin/220730.html. The second parliamentary committee released 78 million files to public access. As part of this process, Volkogonov was able to personally review \\"many documents of the Communist Party Central Committee and the Politburo.\\" This declassification of state and Party papers allowed historians access which had never been allowed going back to the early formation of the Soviet Union seventy years before. When notice of Volkogonov's research became known in the West, inquiries came to him from Alger Hiss and his lawyer in the United States. In 1948, Hiss had been accused of being a spy for the Soviet Union. When Hiss's lawyer contacted Volkogonov to check the KGB archives for record of Hiss as a spy, The New York Times reported: > \\"Not a single document, and a great amount of materials has been studied, > substantiates the allegation that Mr. A. Hiss collaborated with the > intelligence services of the Soviet Union,\\" the official, Gen. Dmitry A. > Volkogonov, chairman of the Russian Government's military intelligence > archives, declared. He called the espionage accusations against Mr. Hiss > \\"completely groundless.\\" Later Volgokonov took issue with what amounted to exoneration of Hiss. In a New York Times article entitled \\"Russian General Retreats on Hiss,\\" Volkogonov clarified: > I was not properly understood... The Ministry of Defense also has an > intelligence service, which is totally different, and many documents have > been destroyed. I only looked through what the K.G.B. had. All I said was > that I saw no evidence.\\" Responding to Volkogonov's last remarks, Hiss himself stated: \\"If he and his associates haven't examined all the files, I hope they will examine the others, and they will show the same thing.\\" Volkogonov co-chaired a U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on Prisoners of War, \\"and continued, always, to write.\\" Volkogonov fell out of favor with Yeltsin in 1994, after opposing the use of force to solve ethnic disputes within areas of the former Soviet Union. Specifically, Volkogonov felt that Yeltsin was taking \\"the advice of wrong- headed counselors\\" in deciding to invade Chechnya.Editor's Preface, Autopsy for an Empire, Shukman, 1997 Biography of Lenin Although Volkogonov began intensive research into Lenin beginning in 1990, by the late 1980s he was actually already arriving at his own conclusion regarding Lenin's role. Lenin's archives were housed in the former Central Committee building on Moscow's Staraya Square. Deep in the basement of the huge grey building were shelves holding metal boxes that contained all the written records associated with Lenin. Volkogonov explained, \\"As I saw more and more closed Soviet archives, as well as the large Western collections at Harvard University and the Hoover Institution in California, Lenin's profile altered in my estimation\\". Volkogonov always used to say \\"that in his own mind, Lenin was the last bastion to fall.\\" He said that the turning point was when he discovered one of Lenin's orders calling for the public hanging of Kulak peasants in 1918: Character When Volkogonov's editor for the English editions of his books, Harold Shukman, first met him in Oxford, England in 1989, he found Volkogonov to be \\"utterly unlike [his] idea of a Soviet general.\\" Shukman explained: \\"He did not strut or swagger, or drink or smoke, and in the many different situations in which I was to see him ‚Äî in other countries, in Russia, with academics, etc., he was invariably easy-going and relaxed, and plainly popular.\\" By the end of his life, Volkogonov had \\"firmly committed himself to the view that Russia's only hope in 1917 lay in the liberal and social democratic coalition that emerged in the February Revolution.\\" Volkogonov told his editor that the \\"spiritual strength\\" that he displayed in his last years was derived from undergoing a Christian baptism. As one Los Angeles Times writer described Volkogonov: \\"For exposing truths and exploding myths, Volkogonov was often accused of treason and treachery. But he never retreated.\\" Volkogonov was under tremendous pressures at the time. For instance he related that when he would enter the Russian Parliament (where he had held a seat as a liberal since the Gorbachev era), he would be met by Communist legislators who would \\"line up at the door and shout insults.\\" Of this Volkogonov commented at the time, \\"I take these shouts as sounds of historical praise.\\" Last years Volkogonov's gravestone in Moscow \\"Despite his undergoing extensive surgery for colon and liver cancer\\" in 1991, the pace of both his political activity and the publication of his writings increased sharply. During the August 1991 coup attempt in which a hardliners attempted to wrest control from Gorbachev in an attempt to reassert the Communist Party's power in the Soviet Union, Volkogonov was in a hospital in London. When Volkogonov saw the news of the coup on television, he said to his editor, \\"So, they've done it.\\" Defense Minister Dmitry Yazov, who had fired Volkogonov from the Institute three months earlier, had told him, \\"something will happen to get rid of the likes of you.\\" From his hospital bed Volkogonov broadcast an appeal on the BBC to the Soviet army to not obey the orders of the coup leaders. Volkogonov was the co-chairman of Task Force Russia, an American Russian organization tasked with finding American POWs in Russia. He told a US Senate committee that 730 American airmen had been captured on Cold War spy flights.Soviets Executed GIs After WWII : Prisoners: Other Americans were forced to renounce citizenship, Yeltsin writes Senate panel. But no sign of POWs from Korea, Vietnam wars found, Russian says., Los Angeles Times. Volkogonov died from cancer in December 1995 at the age of 67. His family donated his papers to the United States Library of Congress. Volkogonov is most famous for his trilogy Leaders (–í–æ–∂–¥–∏, or Vozhdi), which consists of the three books about: Vladimir Lenin (Lenin: A New Biography, 1994); Leon Trotsky (Trotsky: The Eternal Revolutionary, 1992); and Joseph Stalin (Stalin: Triumph and Tragedy). He also finished just before his death Autopsy for an Empire: the Seven Leaders Who Built the Soviet Regime (Russian title: Sem Vozhdei). The book presents chapters on \\"the seven leaders of the Soviet Union: Lenin, Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev, Andropov, Chernenko and Gorbachev.\\" Volkogonov was in the Soviet Army during the reign of six of the seven leaders, and he had \\"direct working contact\\" with four of those leaders in his role as a colonel-general. The English editions were essentially condensed versions of the much longer Russian originals, as acknowledged by their translator and editor Harold Shukman.

A longtime resident of Fort Collins, Colorado, Watrous is noted for History of Larimer County, Colorado (1911), the first comprehensive published history of Larimer County, Colorado. A Forest Service campground in the Poudre Canyon in the Roosevelt National Forest northwest of Fort Collins is named for him. Life Ansel was born November 1, 1835, in Conquinbroom County, New York, the eldest of six children of Oron and Jane Watrous. Oron was a brother of William Watrous, who would settle in Fort Collins in 1871, where Ansel, his nephew, would join him years later. The Watrous family came from England in colonial times. They and their descendants were prominent in the affairs of war and peace in Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and New York, during the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812 and the Indian Wars. Ansel was named for his paternal grandfather, a country squire of Susquehanna, Pennsylvania. His father moved his family to Brotherton, Wisconsin, but in two years he died of cholera and the family moved to New York State. At seventeen Ansel, having had some education at a private academy, was apprenticed to a carpenter. At 20 he returned to Wisconsin, and on Christmas Day 1856 married Floral Thompson of Stockbridge, Wisconsin. He followed his trade of contracting and building and also taught school. He had an interest in politics, being elected to the position of Sheriff in 1860 and in 1864 as a county clerk. In December 1877 he took the first step toward moving to Fort Collins, making a four-day trip on the Colorado Central Railroad. He was met by his uncle Willian F. Watrous and taken to the Watrous home on Myrtle Street. He had arrived on December 30 and on the first of January went to work for W.C. Stover at his store. He was forty-two and had left a settled community where he was known and respected to move to a frontier town with few houses or trees and with only boardwalks alongside muddy streets. He sensed, however, the excitement of a frontier town. The sound of sawing and hammering and the site of wagons loaded with building materials and streets crowded with all sorts of people told him the town was on the move. It isn't clear when his wife, Floral Thompsen Watrous, left her close-knit family in Wisconsin for what became a lonely life on the frontier. She found it difficult to adjust and wrote of her loneliness to her family but stayed to make her husband a home writing, \\"I can never be happy away from him.\\" Watrous lost no time in establishing himself. By June 1877 he was the co-founder of a newspaper the Fort Collins Courier. His partner, Elmer Felton, had some newspaper experience and Watrous had some knowledge of printing, as it had once been his father's trade. The Fort Collins Courier had a difficult founding. The men worked with an old Washington Hand Press, which was in poor condition, nor did they have enough type. The press was good for only a seven - column format. That problem was solved by having two pages of the paper printed in Chicago and shipped by rail to Fort Collins where it was joined with two pages of local news. This despite the paper's motto of \\"home first, the world afterwards.\\" In early 1879 they finally had enough type to print the whole paper locally. A columnist for a later paper, the Express Courier, called the paper \\"a fiery, Democratic newspaper in a hostile and smugly vindictive community noted for its conservative posture.\\" In November 1880 the paper was expanded to eight columns and two years later, with a new power press, a daily edition was started. Watrous bought Felton out at this time and was the sole proprietor and editor until 1886, when he sold the paper to the Courier Printing and Publishing Company. He stayed on as president and editor, even when the paper was again sold, this time to a Republican. In 1881 Watrous was appointed to the town board of trustees. He tried politics in 1882 and 1884 as the Democratic candidate for state auditor but was defeated both times. He was appointed Postmaster from 1885‚Äì1889, during the Cleveland administration. In 1889 Watrous served on the board of directors for the new Public Library Association. In November 1878 Watrous got his first full view of the Rocky Mountains. He'd gone with his uncle in a spring wagon to get firewood to a place west of the Batterson Ranch. \\"Nothing exciting about the ride,\\" he wrote, \\"but I was delighted with the view of snow-capped peaks in the distance with the panorama of rock rested and timbered covered hills which unrolled itself to our gaze. It was my first view of the Rocky Mountains. A view I had longed for, and I shall never forget that day's ride.\\" His love of the region would inspire him to write the History of Larimer County, Colorado, which he completed in 1910.This biography was by his grand niece, Doris Greenacre from a speech given on January 28, 1985, at Colorado State University  Burial  Watrous was buried in Grandview Cemetery, Fort Collins.

King Louis XIV needed a large water supply for his fountains at Versailles. Before the Marly Machine was built, the amount of water delivered to Versailles already exceeded that used by the city of Paris, but this was insufficient, and fountain-rationing was necessary.Thompson 2006, p. 251 and note on p. 351 (\\"Even though more ...\\"), citing Adams 1979, p. 88. Ironically most of the water pumped by the Marly Machine ended up being used to develop a new garden at the Ch√¢teau de Marly. However, even if all the water pumped at Marly (an average of 3,200 cubic metres per day, or 845,351 gallons per day) had been supplied to Versailles, it still would not have been enough: the fountains running √† l'ordinaire (that is, at half pressure) required at least four times as much. The Machine de Marly, based on a prototype at the Ch√¢teau de Modave, consisted of fourteen gigantic water wheels, each roughly 11.5 meters or 38 feet in diameter,Pendery 2004. that powered more than 250 pumps to bring water up a hillside from the Seine River to the Louveciennes Aqueduct. Louis XIV had countless schemes and inventions that were supposed to bring water to his fountains. The Machine de Marly was by far his most extensive and costly plan. After three years of construction and a cost of approximately 5,500,000 livres, the massive contraption, considered the most complex of the 17th century, was completed. \\"The chief engineer for the project was Arnold de Ville and the 'contractor' was Rennequin Sualem (after whom the quai by the machine is now named).\\" Both men had experience in pumping water from coal mines in the region of Li√®ge (in modern Belgium).Demoulin & Kupper 2004, p. 199. The machine suffered from frequent breakdowns, required a permanent staff of sixty to maintain and often required costly repairs. It functioned for 133 years. Destroyed in 1817, it was replaced by a \\"machine temporaire\\" during 10 years and then a steam engine entered in service from 1827 to 1859. From 1859 to 1963, the pumping at Marly was assumed by another hydraulic machine conceived by the engineer Xavier Dufrayer.Barbet 1907, p. 166, note 3. Dufrayer's machine was scrapped in 1968 and replaced by electromechanical pumps. Historical context From the beginning, the construction of the ch√¢teau and the park of Versailles water supply had posed a problem. The site chosen by Louis XIV, a former hunting lodge of Louis XIII, was far removed from any river and high in elevation. The sovereign's will to have a park with more and more basins, water jets and fountains became a hallmark of his reign by the extension and improvement of a permanent water supply system with the construction of new pumps, aqueducts and reservoirs to collect ever more water, from a greater and greater distance. The idea to bring water from the Seine to Versailles had always been under consideration. But more than just the distance - the river is located nearly 10 km from the ch√¢teau - there was the problem of the elevation to ascend, nearly 150 meters (490 feet). Since 1670, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Louis XIV's Superintendent of the King's Buildings, had opposed several projects, including one proposed by , both for reasons of feasibility and that of cost.Bentz & Soullard 2011. Arnold de Ville (1653-1722), a young and ambitious bourgeois of Huy in the Province of Li√®ge, who had already built a pump in Saint-Maur, succeeded in submitting to the king his project for pumping the waters of the River Seine to the Ch√¢teau of Val in the forest of Saint-Germain, demonstrating that the same could be done to supply Versailles. This machine, a sort of small scale model of what the Machine of Marly could be, impressed the king,Testard-Vallant 2010, pp. 70‚Äì71. who then entrusted him with the development of a machine on the Seine to supply not only the gardens of Versailles, but also those of the Chateau of Marly then under construction. Location The Machine de Marly site is located 7 km (4.4 mi) north of the Ch√¢teau de Versailles and 16.3 km (10.2 mi) west of the center of Paris, on the Seine in the Yvelines department. The river pumps and administration buildings are located in what is now the town of Bougival; relay pumps, machinery, the aqueduct and reservoirs are located in Louveciennes. One reservoir is in the town of Marly-le-Roi. Between Port- Marly and Bezons, the Seine, along its length, was divided into two arms by a series of islands and earth berms linked together by timber/rock dikes to form two disconnected, parallel river beds over ten kilometers in length. The hydraulic pumping machinery, propelling the river water to the top of the hill that borders the Seine, was constructed across from the left arm of the river, a little below the small village of La Chauss√©e, downstream of Bougival. Barbet 1907, p. 95. A dam at Bezons on the right arm creates a hydraulic head measuring 3.1 meters (10 feet 2 inches) high to power the wheels of the Machine de Marly.Barbet 1907, p. 101. The upper pumping relay station (demolished) was located next to the Ch√¢teau des Eaux (1700) and pumped water to the top of the Louveciennes aqueduct, which fed the Louveciennes and Marly reservoirs, near the site of the Ch√¢teau de Marly (demolished).

He had already worked with them on a pump at the Ch√¢teau de Modave and Rennequin Sualem was the designer of the pump at the Ch√¢teau de Val. The entire project ‚Äì channeling and dikes on the Seine, construction of the machine and the network of aqueducts and basins ‚Äì would last for 6 years. The chosen site on the Seine would later become the town of Bougival (at the location of the current locks of Bougival). About 7 kilometers upstream, Colbert channeled a portion of the Seine by linking several islands with dikes from the island of Bezons and separating the river into two arms, a western arm for navigation and an eastern arm destined to supply the machine by creating a constriction and a drop of about three meters to power the 14 paddle wheels of the machine. The construction mobilized 1800 workers and required more than 100,000 tons of wood, 17,000 tons of iron and 800 tons of lead and as much cast iron. The wood used in the construction of the platform and the wheels of the machine, and for the dikes between the islands and for the buildings came from the surrounding forests. The iron for rods came from the Nivernais and Champagne and most of the cast iron pipe was produced in Normandy. A large number of Walloons came to work on the project. They possessed a know-how acquired from their work on water evacuation from mines. Many defected as well because of the economic difficulties encountered then in Wallonia, which had been ravaged by wars. Illiterate, the Sualem brothers were from a family of master carpenters from the mines of Li√®ge. They were the only ones to have mastered the mechanism for remote power transmission, the flatrod system necessary for the proper functioning of the machine of Marly. The Walloon craftsmen went on to become the primary maintenance men essential for the enormous task of keeping the machine in working order. File:Machine de Marly- carte de la Seine.jpgMap of 1783 showing the deviation of the Seine File:Carte Machine de Marly.jpgElevation and perspective of the Machine de Marly (c. 1715) by Nicolas de Fer The work began in June 1681 with the canalization of the Seine. The construction of the machine began at the end of 1681. On June 14, 1682, a successful demonstration was held in the presence of Louis XIV. The water could be elevated to the top of the hillside. The machine was inaugurated June 13, 1684 by the king and his court. The aqueduc de Louveciennes was completed in 1685 and the entire project, three years later, in 1688. The total cost of the project was 5.5 million livres tournois (over 100 million dollars 2015 Tiberghien 2002, p. 12.). It included the construction of the machine itself (3,859,583 livres), buildings, aqueducts and water basins, the supply of materials, and the wages of the workers and artisans. (Rennequin Sualem was the best paid with 1800 pounds per year.). After the end of the work and the successful demonstration, Rennequin Sualem was appointed First Engineer of the King by Louis XIV and knighted. To the king, who asked him how he had had the idea of this machine, Rennequin answered in Walloon: \\"Tot tuzant, Sire\\" (\\"By thinking hard, Sire\\"). \\"Rennequin Sualem\\" of: \\"Famous Belgians\\" Arnold de Ville earned a great deal of money from the success of the machine and was able to rise into the aristocracy. Description Engraved view of the Machine de Marly, looking downriver The engraving illustrated here describes the functioning of the machine as follows: > THE MACHINE OF MARLY is built on an arm of the Seine river. It consists of > 14 wheels of 30 feet [11.9 m; 39 English feet] in diameter, the axles of > which have two cranks, one which moves the pistons which push the water into > the pipes and raise it up to the first reservoir; the other moves a system > of crossarm levers which run the length of the mountain up to the highest > reservoir. These crossarms power the pumps which are in the reservoirs and > pump the water from the lower reservoir to the upper and from there to the > top of the tower which is at the summit of the mountain, from where it runs > over a large aqueduct which feeds different pipes to furnish all the waters > of Versailles and Marly.'' Pumping technology of the era of Louis XIV did not allow the delivery of water from the Seine to the top of the aqueduct of Louveciennes, an elevation differential of more than 150 meters (490 feet) in just one stage, so two intermediate pump relay stations were built, one at 48 meters (156 feet) and another at 99 meters (322 feet) above the river. Pumps in the relay locations were powered by two sets of oscillating timber and metal tie-rod linkages, driven by the river paddle wheels. A reservoir at each station buffered the water supply for each level of pumps.

The overgrown walls of the mid-slope reservoir are visible on the hillside, just adjacent to the cobblestone path that runs straight up the incline. The paving stones on this 17th century service road are set with their top edges slightly exposed to allow better traction for the horses which hauled loads uphill. Two administration buildings from the original Machine complex of 1684 still exist next to the Seine.Entry PA00087379 (in French), website of the French Monuments historiques.

Its Middle Persian equivalent, as attested in the Pahlavi script texts of Zoroastrian tradition, is ê≠•ê≠§ê≠•ê≠¨ê≠≠ Wahman, which is a borrowing of the Avestan language expression and has the same meaning, and which continues in New Persian as Bahman and variants. Manah is cognate with the Sanskrit word Manas suggesting some commonality between the ideas of the Gathas and those of the Rigveda. The opposite of Vohu Manah is Aka Manah, \\"evil purpose\\" or \\"evil mind\\". The term is a compound of the words vohu \\"good\\" and manah \\"mind, thought, purpose\\", cognate with the Vedic words v√°su and m√°nas, both with the same meaning. Both of these derive from Proto-Indo-Iranian *Hw√°su≈° and *m√°nas, in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h‚ÇÅw√©sus and *m√©nos. In the Gathas, the oldest texts of the Avesta and considered to be composed by Zoroaster, the term 'Vohu Manah' is not unambiguously used as a proper name and frequently occurs without the \\"Good\\" (Vohu-) prefix. In the post-Gathic texts that expound the principles of Zoroastrian cosmogony, Vohu Manah is an Amesha Spenta, one of seven emanations of Ahura Mazda that each represent one facet of creation. In the case of Vohu Manah, this is all animal creation, with a particular stress on cattle. Vohu Manah is of neutral gender in Avestan grammar but in Zoroastrian tradition is considered masculine. In the Zoroastrian calendar, the second day of each month as well as the eleventh month of each year are dedicated to Vohu Manah. In the Iranian civil calendar, which inherits the names of the months from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 11th month is likewise named Bahman. The Achaemenid emperor Artaxerxes II (as it is rendered in Greek) had \\"Vohu Manah\\" as the second part of his throne name, which when \\"translated\\" into Greek appeared as \\"Mnemon\\". New Persian Bahman remains a theophoric in present-day Iranian and Zoroastrian tradition. See also * Amesha Spentas, the emanations of Ahura Mazda in Zoroastrianism.

He led the Buffalo Bandits to 3 of their 4 championships in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL), and won 4 more championships with the Toronto Rock in the renamed National Lacrosse League (NLL). Buffalo Bandits Bartley became the assistant coach of the Bandits in 1992. When the team started off the 1992 season 0-3, Bandits head coach Buff McCready was fired, and Bartley was given the job of head coach. He then led the team on a 22-game winning streak and MILL championships in 1992 and 1993. The streak included the entire 1993 season, during which the Bandits were 8-0, the only undefeated season in NLL/MILL history. The streak came to an end on February 19, 1994. Bartley's only losing season as a professional lacrosse coach came in the 1995 season after going 3-5. In 1996, he coached the Bandits to their third championship in the MILL. After the 1997 season, Les left the Bandits after leading them to a 36-13 record in six seasons. Toronto Rock When the MILL became the NLL in 1998, the league added its first Canadian franchise: the Ontario Raiders, who played in Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario. Bartley, a native of nearby St. Catharines, Ontario, helped get the new franchise off the ground. In 1999, the Ontario Raiders moved to Toronto and became the Toronto Rock. Les coached the Rock to four championships in five years. In November 2003, Les gave up his role of Coach and General Manager of the Rock to fight colon cancer, though he maintained the title of Vice-President of the Rock. Prior to the 2005 season, Bartley, who worked as a General Motors union representative until retiring in 2004, lent his labour negotiation expertise to the league, helping to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the NLL players' association. On May 9, 2005, Bartley was named by the NLL as its Executive of the Year. Less than a week later, on May 15, 2005, Les Bartley died at his home in St. Catharines after his 18-month battle with cancer. Bartley was 51. He died 18 hours after the Toronto Rock won their 5th NLL Championship. Legacy Bartley led the Rock to a 51-19 record in five seasons in the NLL, and 9-1 in the post-season. His overall record of 93-38 (.709) in the regular season is second all-time. Only current Buffalo Bandits coach Darris Kilgour has more. His 18-4 (.818) record in the playoffs is the most wins of any coach in NLL history. In recognition of Bartley's contribution to the NLL and his success as a coach, the NLL renamed the annual Coach of the Year award as the Les Bartley Award. Fittingly, two of the first recipients of the renamed award were Derek Keenan of the Portland Lumberjax in 2006 and Ed Comeau of the Rochester Knighthawks in 2007, both former assistants of Bartley in Toronto. In June 2005, the National Lacrosse League announced that Bartley would be a Charter member of the National Lacrosse League Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the 2006 NLL All-Star Game in Toronto. In March 2007, the Toronto Rock announced a new award in honour of Bartley. The Les Bartley Award (not to be confused with the Les Bartley Award given by the league) will be \\"given annually to the Rock player that best exemplifies Les' emphasis on the importance of character and commitment to the team\\".

An Elementary View of the Proceedings in an Action at Law. London: Stevens & Sons, 1873, p. 432-433.Farran, Sue and Paterson, Donald. South Pacific Property Law. Florence, Ky.: Routledge, 2004, p. 90. The concept is feudal in origin, and common in countries which rely on the English legal system (including many former British colonies). The word is derived from the root word demesne. Mesne profits commonly occur where a landlord has obtained an order from a court to evict a tenant, or where an individual sues to eject a bona fide landowner to whom title to land was improperly conveyed. The mesne profit represents the value (living rent-free, profits earned from the land, etc.) the ejected tenant received from the property between the time the court ordered the eviction and the time when the tenant actually left the property. Mesne profits must be drawn from the land itself, rather than improvements on it. For example, mesne profits may accrue from growing crops on land but would not generally accrue from a factory built on the land (unless there were damage to the land or improvements to the land itself such as the removal of stone from a field).Corpus Juris Secundum: A Complete Restatement of the Entire American Law as Developed by All Reported Cases. St. Paul, Minn.: Thomson/West, 1974, p. 163. A statute of limitations (usually six years) often limits the tenant-in-error's liability.Smith, An Elementary View of the Proceedings in an Action at Law, 1873, p. 433. Calculating mesne profits is often regulated by legislatures, but may be litigated in a court of equity. Mesne profits may be calculated, even though there may be no point in doing so (as in the case where land was flooded by a dam, and the dam is not going to be removed).See, for example, Winchester v. Stevens Point, 58 Wis. 350, 17 N.W. 3 (Wis.1883). In the United States, laws regulating mesne profits have been the subject of Supreme Court decisions, such as Green v. Biddle, 21 U.S. 1 (1823).

Together with Wollerau, Pf√§ffikon is considered the principal town of the district (Bezirk) of H√∂fe and the center of the region of Ausserschwyz. The former farm town is known today as cultural, economic and service center with its main focus on hedge funds. With 7,200 residents Pf√§ffikon is the third biggest town of the canton after K√ºssnacht and Einsiedeln.  Politics  Pf√§ffikon, together with Wilen bei Wollerau, Freienbach, B√§ch and Hurden form the Municipality of Freienbach, but being the main traffic junction in the area it is the most important town in the municipality. In 1848 Pf√§ffikon lost its independent status and was subsequently merged into Freienbach. With important administrative and educational centers as well as one of the two fire departments of the canton in town, Pf√§ffikon became the second, northern center of the canton, especially since the canton's capital, Schwyz, across in the foothills of the Alps is relatively difficult to reach (via Biberbrugg-Rothenthurm). This resulted in Pf√§ffikon orienting itself more towards Z√ºrich than Schwyz, causing political tensions. The closeness to Z√ºrich as well as the low tax rates led to Pf√§ffikon's position as economic center of the canton.  Business location  LGT in Pf√§ffikon With the lowest tax burden for companies and private individuals and ideally located between the dynamic Zurich economic area and attractive recreation areas, Pf√§ffikon represents = Taxation = Pf√§ffikon has very sensible government spending and has managed to always maintain a positive balance sheet. The large increase of tax payers and the amount of taxes paid by mainly the financial industry made it possible to lower taxes to the residents and businesses of Pf√§ffikon for 5 years in a row, resulting in the lowest tax rates of Switzerland.  Economy  Man Group in Pf√§ffikon In the last 10 years Pf√§ffikon became an important financial center housing many asset management companies, (fund of) hedge funds, (fund of) private equity funds, family offices, etc. Together with Zug in canton Zug, Pf√§ffikon in canton Schwyz has become one of the most important financial centers in Switzerland. The total assets managed out of Switzerland exceed EUR 100 billion. The economic boom started in Pf√§ffikon in the 1990s when Swiss banking regulations eased up. The closeness to Zurich as well as the low tax rates were also responsible for the rapid development, leading to some major financial institutions to relocate to Pf√§ffikon. The biggest and best known companies in Pf√§ffikon are OC Oerlikon, Man Group, Pamasol and LGT Group, Glacier Reinsurance, Markant AG, Charles V√∂gele and Seedamm-Center.  Education  Pf√§ffikon offers 8 kindergartens, 3 primary schools and one secondary school as well one of the two cantonwide schools and an open university.

Plot Lisa calls in to an unpopular public radio station and wins tickets for four to an Albanian movie called Kosovo Autumn. Homer leaves Maggie with Ned Flanders, who agrees to babysit free of charge, while the rest of the family watches the movie. When Marge picks up Maggie and hastily offers to pay Ned admits to needing extra money as a giant retail store called Left- Mart is threatening his business. Marge suggests he rent out one of his rooms to someone. He agrees, giving the room to Katja and Vicky, two female community college students. Taking advantage of his trusting nature, the two use their room as a staging area for a softcore pornographic website, sexyslumberparty.com. Bart and Milhouse come across a banner ad for the site and share their discovery with Homer, who proceeds to spread the news around town. Marge soon discovers Homer and Bart viewing the website and forces Homer to tell Ned everything. Ned angrily forces the girls to leave, but realizes that everyone has arrived to cheer for them. Horrified at both the town's mockery and Homer's betrayal, Ned leaves town, moving to \\"Humbleton, Pennsylvania\\", home of the porcelain \\"Humble figurines\\",\\"Humble\\" figurines are apparently in reference to real Hummel figurines, but Hummelstown, Pennsylvania has no relation to the figurines. which he collects. Angered by Homer's actions, Marge and Lisa tell him to be on his best behavior for their new neighbor, \\"Coach\\" Clay Roberts, who becomes a cynical bully towards Homer and litters the Simpsons' yard with Ned's fallen trees, cutting their cable, and siphoning gas from Homer's car. Meanwhile, Ned finds the friendly pseudo- Germanic town of Humbleton to be everything he ever dreamed. However, when applying for a job at the Humbleton Figurine Workshop, the manager requests him to shave his moustache, declaring it \\"hippie-ish\\" and distracting. Ned briefly considers it, but soon decides it is more important than the opinions of the townspeople, who shun him. Homer drives to Humbleton and pleads with Ned to return, who, upon seeing the judgmental faces of the Humbleton residents glaring at him, agrees. Clay refuses to leave the house, despite Ned pointing out that his $200,000 check bounced, thus he legally still owns the property, but is persuaded once Ned and Homer overpower him by sheer force. A few hours later, Homer obtains a pipe organ, which Ned believes is from the local church, and places it in Ned's backyard for a welcome-home party, which several Springfield residents attend. Ned is happy at the party, which soon irritates Homer.

Founded in August 2005, it is located on 12005 S. 248th Ave and is part of Plainfield Community Consolidated School District 202. It currently serves students who live in northern Plainfield and parts of Romeoville and Naperville. History Due to a rapidly growing population, PNHS was established to ease student overflow in Plainfield's other schools, Plainfield South High School and Plainfield Central High School. It opened in the beginning of the 2005-06 school year for incoming freshmen and sophomores only. As the years went on and classes progressed into the upper classes of juniors and seniors, additional classes were added in their place with the school becoming a full-fledged four year high school in the 2007-2008 academic year. During the 2008-2009 academic year, a small portion of PNHS students were re-zoned to the newly opened Plainfield East High School. Most students who were transferred lived in the Bolingbrook, Illinois area. Academics =Testing= Plainfield North began ACT testing in April 2007 and graduated its first class in 2008 with 512 students. As of the 2010-2011 academic year, PNHS's mean ACT score is 22.1 and the mean PSAE score is 160.http://www.psd202.org/Documents/ReportCards/PNHS.pdf Based on PNHS's test performance, SchoolDigger ranks PNHS 104th of 667 Illinois public high schools. = Achievements= For the 2011-2012 academic year, 40 PNHS students were named AP Scholars and four students were named AP Scholars with Honor. In the same year, four PNHS students were also earned National Merit Commended Status through the PSAT/NMSQT, the most from any other District 202 high schools that year. Athletics Plainfield North competes in the Southwest Prairie Conference and Illinois High School Association, and its mascot is the Tiger. Girls Volleyball, Boys Track, as well as the girls' track team, won conference in their first year with seniors. The girls' team was also undefeated. In the 2007-2008 season, girls' bowling won both conference and sectional titles and advanced to the state competition where they placed 13th. The Plainfield North girls volleyball team made Plainfield North history by being the first team to win a Sectional championship at Plainfield North in the 2014-2015 season. They have won 3 Regional championships and 3 conference championship titles in a row also. In October 2010, then PNHS running back Kapri Bibbs broke the 24-year-old state record for most rushing yards in one game during a game against Oswego High School, achieving 520 yards along with seven touchdowns. In 2010, the PNHS marching band finished at 8th place in the state competition, marking the highest finish for any District 202 marching band since 1998. In 2013, the marching band placed 3rd in state. As a result, the school attracted considerable attention from the band community and made history for the Plainfield high schools. Controversies In 2006, PNHS's football program was found to be in violation of multiple Illinois High School Association rules, mainly stemming from illegal recruitment of players. As a result, the PNHS football team was barred from competing in the state playoffs for the next two years and the head coach of the football program, Dan Darlington, was suspended for the remainder of the 2006-2007 season. Dr. Peter Pasteris, the school's inaugural principal, was also barred from acting as the school's official representative to the IHSA, later being dismissed as the school's principal after a vote by the school board. During the 2010-2011 school year, there have been 2 separate incidents involving inappropriate teacher/student relationships. Former Dance Teacher, Ashley Blumenshine was allegedly caught by police having sex with a male 16-year-old student in the parking lot of a Kohl's at around 6:00 p.m. on a school night. She is in the midst of her trial for sexual abuse. Later in the year, former Athletic director Doug Stevens was pressured to resign after news of a questionable relationship with a former student emerged. On July 10, 2013 Plainfield North business teacher and wrestling coach Max Estes was arrested and held on $300,000 bail on child pornography charges. Estes was a non-tenured teacher who passed all background checks when he was hired. He later resigned from his teaching post. On November 19, 2016 Plainfield North was awarded a controversial victory over Fenwick High School in the 7A state semifinal in overtime. ‚ÄúOn the final play of the fourth quarter in today‚Äôs IHSA Class 7A Semifinal Football game between Fenwick High School and Plainfield North High School, an error was made by the officiating crew, which resulted in an untimed down being awarded to Plainfield North. On the untimed down, Plainfield North tied the contest with a field goal and then went on to win the game in overtime. Per Rule 3-3-4 in the 2016 NFHS Football Rules Book, the game should have concluded on the final play of regulation and the untimed down should not have been awarded. The IHSA issued an apology to Fenwick, as the rules clearly state that Plainfield should not have received an untimed down, but it could not overturn the game. Fenwick sued the IHSA seeking immediate injunctive relief for the right to go to the State Championship game. Judge Kathleen Kennedy listened to the arguments of both Fenwick and the IHSA and after deliberating ruled in favor of the IHSA.

It takes place in a mythic New York City, markedly different from reality, and in an industrial Edwardian era near the turn of the 20th century. The novel was adapted into a feature film by Akiva Goldsman. Characters =Peter Lake= Peter Lake is the central character of Winter's Tale. A child of an immigrant couple denied admission at Ellis Island, Peter Lake is set adrift in New York Harbor in a miniature model ship called City of Justice. He is found in the reeds and adopted by the Baymen of the Bayonne Marsh, who send him off to Manhattan when he comes of age. There he first becomes a mechanic and then is forced to become a burglar in a gang called the Short Tails. He soon makes a mortal enemy of their leader, Pearly Soames, and is constantly on the run from the gang. Early one winter morning, Peter is on the brink of being captured and killed by the gang when he is rescued by a mysterious white horse, who becomes his guardian. While attempting to rob a house, Peter Lake meets and falls in love with Beverly Penn. The daughter of millionaire Isaac Penn, owner and publisher of The Sun, one of New York's greatest newspapers, Beverly is eccentric, free-spirited, and enigmatic. This captivates Peter initially, but her deeper nature is revealed with her terminal consumption. Beverly never disappears from Peter's life, protecting him until the very end. His love for the dying Beverly causes him to become obsessed with justice. In yet another escape from Pearly's men, both Peter Lake and the white horse crash into a mysterious recurring cloud wall, disappearing in it for decades. When Peter Lake emerges, he no longer remembers who he is and is visibly no longer of this world, seeing and hearing things that nobody else can see or hear. One night, in a dream or a vision, he is carried on a tour of all the graves of the world, observing and remembering all the dead. In the apocalyptic chaos of burning New York, he acquires astonishing powers. Peter Lake refers to himself, earlier in his life, as \\"Grand Central Pete\\". In reality, there was a well-known confidence man in the late 19th century known by this name. =Athansor= Athansor, the white horse, acts as a guardian angel of Peter Lake. Able to fly and possessing extraordinary endurance, the white horse appears to be an angelic being. Before the end, Peter Lake releases him to finally let him go to heaven, as Athansor had not been able to do before because of Peter Lake. The white horse appears on the first pages of the book, saving Peter Lake who is being pursued by the Short Tails. The name of the horse is unknown to Peter Lake, but when Peter Lake visits Bayonne Marsh, the Baymen recognise the horse as Athansor, part of their oral lore. The Baymen arrive from everywhere to view the horse, but never explain what they know about him besides the name and the fact that he comes from the left. Athansor is separated from Peter Lake when they both crash into the cloud wall but gets reunited with him towards the end of the story. Peter Lake releases him, and Athansor heads towards the heavenly pastures. As he gallops across Manhattan, trying to lift off, the whole island shakes under his hoofbeats. =Beverly Penn= Beverly Penn is a young woman dying from consumption who meets Peter Lake when he breaks into her house. Beverly is a visionary who can feel the universe. She writes down equations that explain the universe and mean for her that the universe shouts and growls. Beverly's father, newspaper publisher Isaac Penn, says about her that she had seen the Golden Age. Even after her death, Beverly protects Peter Lake. Pearly Soames says that he tried but could not get to Peter Lake through Beverly's protection. =Jackson Mead= A master bridge builder and an enigmatic figure, Jackson Mead constructed many fine bridges all around the country. He is a brilliant engineer and appears to have unlimited material resources for the job. He is eventually revealed to be an exile from heaven, whose purpose is to build one last bridge that will bring forth the end of the world as it is, letting him return to heaven. As Jackson Mead puts it, his purpose is \\"to tag this world with wider and wider rainbows, until the last is so perfect and eternal that it will catch the eye of the One who has abandoned us, and bring Him to right all the broken symmetries and make life once again a still and timeless dream. My purpose, Mr. Marratta, is to stop time, to bring back the dead. My purpose, in one word, is justice.\\" Jackson Mead's rainbow bridge does not take, but he is not upset by the failure and disappears to bide time until his next attempt. It is interesting that Jackson Mead's stated goal \\"to stop time and bring back the dead\\", in precisely these words, is widely associated with Peter Lake and in particular attributed to him on the back of the paperback edition. Jackson Mead's character is partially based on Joseph Strauss, the engineer of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hardesty Marratta recognizes Jackson Mead's face in the face of the monument to Joseph Strauss at the Golden Gate. The inscription on the monument refers to the bridge as the \\"eternal rainbow\\", a simile used by Jackson Mead. However, despite being a main character in the novel, he does not make an appearance in the movie. =Residents of Lake of the Coheeries= Lake of the Coheeries is a semi-mythical lake and village, playing the role of Faerie, Elfland, or Alfheim. Lake of the Coheeries is fictional, supposedly located in upstate New York across a mountain range from the Hudson River Valley. Virginia Gamely is a resident there, living with her mother, Mrs. Gamely. Both women ultimately play roles in New York City at the end of the tale. Virginia's daughter is resurrected by Peter Lake. Literary significance and reception Winter's Tale was published in 1983. It was praised on the front cover of the New York Times Book Review (NYTBR) as \\"funny, thoughtful, passionate...large-souled.\\"'Winter's Tale' (\\"Not for some time have I read a work as funny, thoughtful, passionate or large-souled. Rightly used, it could inspire as well as comfort us. Winter's Tale is a great gift at an hour of great need.\\") Reviewing the novel in Interzone magazine, Mary Gentle described Winter's Tale as \\"a faerie family saga\\" and \\"the first specifically capitalist fantasy\\".David Pringle, Modern Fantasy: The Hundred Best Novels : an English-language selection, 1946-1987. London : Grafton, 1988. (p. 220-21). David Pringle, in the book Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels, praised Winter's Tale as \\"a haunting piece of North American magic realism\\". In May 2006, the New York Times Book Review published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to \\"a short letter [from the review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages, asking them to identify 'the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years.'\\" Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin's Winter's Tale. Film adaptation The film adaptation was released on Valentine's Day, 2014 and starred Colin Farrell as Peter Lake, Russell Crowe as Pearly Soames, Jessica Brown Findlay as Beverly Penn, Jennifer Connelly as Virginia Gamely, and Will Smith as Lucifer though originally credited as \\"Judge\\".

An attempt by the Union Army to capture Fort Wagner was repulsed. The more famous Second Battle of Fort Wagner, which involved an assault by the 54th Massachusetts, would be fought on July 18. Background In early June 1863, Union Brig. Gen. Quincy A. Gillmore replaced Maj. Gen. David Hunter as commander of the Department of the South. Gillmore, an Army engineer, had successfully captured Fort Pulaski in April 1862. He began preparations for capturing Morris Island and parts of James Island, which dominated the southern approaches to Charleston Harbor. If Union artillery could be placed in those locations, they could assist in the bombardment of Fort Sumter, whose guns prevented the U.S. Navy from entering the harbor.Eicher, pp. 564‚Äì65. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle Map of Fort Wagner I Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On July 10, Union shot artillery on Folly Island (which had been occupied in April 1863) and naval gunfire from Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren's four ironclad warships bombarded the Confederate defenses protecting the southern end of Morris Island. This provided cover for the landing of Brig. Gen. George C. Strong's brigade, which crossed Lighthouse Inlet and landed at the southern tip of the island. Strong's troops advanced, capturing several batteries, moving about three miles to within range of Fort Wagner. Also known as Battery Wagner, it was a heavily gunned redoubt that covered nearly the entire width of the northern end of Morris Island, facing Sumter. Strong's report described the advance: On July 11, Strong's brigade attacked at dawn, advancing through a thick fog, attempting to seize Fort Wagner. Although the men of the 7th Connecticut Infantry overran a line of rifle pits, they were repulsed by the 1,770-man force under Confederate Col. Robert F. Graham. Heavy artillery fire from Fort Wagner prevented other units from joining the attack. Aftermath Union casualties were 339 (49 killed, 123 wounded, 167 missing), Confederate 12.Dyer, p. 831; Kennedy, p. 192. The First Battle of Fort Wagner was followed on July 16 by assaults on James Island and on July 18 by the famous, but also unsuccessful, charge of the 54th Massachusetts Infantry on July 18 in the Second Battle of Fort Wagner. Battlefield preservation In May 2008, TPL and partners, including the South Carolina Conservation Bank, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, the Civil War Trust, (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and many private donors, purchased the island on behalf of the City of Charleston from Ginn Resorts for $3 million. Trust for Public Lands announcement, May 30, 2008, \\"Historic Morris Island Preserved.\\" Accessed May 30, 2018. Previously, in 2003, when a builder announced his plans to build houses on the tract, for which he had an option to buy, the Trust, local preservationist Blake Hallman and others formed the Morris Island Coalition, generated media attention and support for preservation and defeated the effort. Ginn Resorts was interested in developing the property, too, but ultimately decided to purchase it and then immediately sell it to the preservationists.Bob Zeller, \\"Fighting the Second Civil War: A History of Battlefield Preservation and the Emergence of the Civil War Trust,\\" Knox Press, 2017.

Union Army troops commanded by Brig. Gen. Quincy Gillmore launched an unsuccessful assault on the Confederate fortress of Fort Wagner, which protected Morris Island, south of Charleston Harbor. The battle came one week after the First Battle of Fort Wagner. Background Fort Wagner, or Battery Wagner as it was known to the Confederates, controlled the southern approaches to Charleston Harbor. It was commanded by Brigadier General William B. Taliaferro. An attempt was made on July 11 to assault the fort, the First Battle of Fort Wagner, but it was repulsed with heavy losses to the attackers because of artillery and musket fire. Brig. Gen. Quincy Gillmore intended to repeat his assault, but first executed feints to distract the Confederates' attention, the Battle of Grimball's Landing on July 18. Gillmore also ordered an artillery bombardment of the fort. The fort was on a very narrow island so the Union could only assault the fort with one regiment at a time. The approach to the fort was constricted to a strip of beach 60 yards (55 m) wide with the ocean to the east and the marsh from Vincent's (now Bass) Creek to the west. Upon rounding this defile, the Union Army was presented with the 250-yard south face of Fort Wagner, which stretched from Vincent's creek to the sea. Surrounding the fort was a shallow moat riveted with sharpened palmetto logs, as abatis, and the moat on the seaward side had planks with spikes positioned beneath the water. The armament of Fort Wagner on the night of July 18 consisted of one 10-inch seacoast mortar, two 32 lb. carronades, two 8-inch shell guns, two 32 lb. howitzers, a 42 lb. carronade, and an 8-inch seacoast mortar on the land face. Company A of the 1st South Carolina Artillery also had two guns positioned outside of Wagner's southern face by Vincent's creek to provide enfilading fire. The sea face of Wagner was armed with one 32 lb. carronade, one 10-inch Columbiad, and two 12 lb. howitzers. The garrison of Battery Wagner consisted of the 1st South Carolina Artillery, the Charleston Battalion, the 31st North Carolina, and the 51st North Carolina. Opposing forces =Union= =Confederate= Battle Map of Fort Wagner II Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program Gilmore ordered his siege guns and mortars to begin a bombardment of the fort on July 18 and they were joined by the naval gunfire from six monitors that pulled to within 300 yards of the fort. The bombardment lasted eight hours, but caused little damage against the sandy walls of the fort, and in all, killed only about 8 men and wounded an additional 20, as the defenders had taken cover in the bombproof shelter.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, Vol. XXVIII, pp. 418‚Äì419 The 54th Massachusetts, an infantry regiment composed of African-American soldiers led by Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, led the Union attack at dusk. They were backed by two brigades composed of nine regiments. The first brigade was commanded by Gen. George Crockett Strong and was composed of the 54th Massachusetts, 6th Connecticut, 48th New York, 3rd New Hampshire, 76th Pennsylvania, and the 9th Maine regiments. The second brigade was commanded by Col. Haldimand S. Putnam of the 7th New Hampshire as acting brigade commander. His brigade consisted of the 7th New Hampshire, 62nd Ohio, 67th Ohio, and the 100th New York regiments. A third brigade under Gen. Stevenson was in reserve, with General Truman Seymour commanding on the field, but did not enter action. The assault began at 7:45 p.m. and was conducted in three movements. The 54th Massachusetts attacked to the west upon the curtain of Wagner, with the remainder of Gen. Strong's brigade and Col. Putnam's brigade attacking the seaward salient on the south face. As the assault commenced and bombardment subsided, the men of the 1st South Carolina Artillery, Charleston Battalion, and 51st North Carolina Infantry took their positions. The 31st North Carolina, which had been completely captured during the battle of Roanoke Island and later exchanged, remained in the bombproof shelter and did not take its position in the southeast bastion. When the 54th Massachusetts reached about 150 yards from the fort, the defenders opened up with cannon and small arms, tearing through their ranks. The 51st North Carolina delivered a direct fire into them, as the Charleston Battalion fired into their left. The 54th managed to reach the parapet, but after a fierce struggle, including hand-to-hand combat, they were forced back. The 6th Connecticut continued the assault at the weakest point, the southeast, where the 31st had failed to take its position. General Taliaferro quickly rounded up some soldiers to take the position, while the 51st North Carolina and Charleston Battalion fired obliquely into the assailants. Behind the 6th Connecticut, the 48th New York also successfully reached the slopes of the bastion. The remainder of Strong's brigade did not reach that far, as three of the defending howitzers were now in action and firing canister into their flanks, bringing them to a halt. Colonel Putnam quickly brought up his brigade, but only about 100 or 200 men from the 62nd and 67th Ohio reached the bastion. The Confederates attempted to counter-attack twice, but were beaten back after having the officers leading the charge shot down. As the Union assault continued to crumble, due to lack of reinforcements from General Stevenson, Taliaferro was reinforced by the 32nd Georgia Infantry, which had been transported to the island by Brigadier General Johnson Hagood. The fresh troops swept over the bastion, killing and capturing the rest of the Union troops that remained.Emilio, Luis Fenollosa. \\"The assault on Fort Wagner, July 18, 1863: the memorable charge of the Fifty- Fourth Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteers.\\" Boston: Rand Avery Company.

Putnam was shot in the head and killed in the salient while giving the order to withdraw. Col. John Lyman Chatfield of the 6th Connecticut was mortally wounded. The 54th Massachusetts's colonel, Robert Gould Shaw, was killed upon the parapet early in the action. Some Confederate reports claim his body was pierced seven times, with the fatal wound a rifle bullet to his chest. Another of the 54th's casualties was Lewis Douglass, son of the famous orator Frederick Douglass, who was wounded but survived the battle. Aftermath In all, about 1,515 Union soldiers were killed, captured, or wounded in the assault of July 18, although this number has never been accurately ascertained. Gen. Hagood, the commander of Fort Wagner on the morning of July 19, stated in his report to Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard that he buried 800 bodies in mass graves in front of Wagner. Only 315 men were left from the 54th after the battle. Thirty were killed in action, including Col. Shaw and Captains Russel and Simpkins, and buried together in a single grave. Twenty-four later died of wounds, fifteen were captured, and fifty-two were reported missing after the battle and never seen again. The men of the 54th Massachusetts were hailed for their valor. William Carney, an African-American sergeant with the 54th, is considered the first black recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions that day in recovering and returning the unit's U.S. Flag to Union lines.The 54th and Fort Wagner Their conduct improved the reputation of African Americans as soldiers, leading to greater Union recruitment of African-Americans, which strengthened the Northern states' numerical advantage. In addition, the South recognized for the first time that captured African American soldiers were to be treated as enemy combatants and not criminals. Confederate casualties numbered 174. The fort was reinforced by Brig. Gen. Johnson Hagood's brigade shortly after the assault had ended. The garrison of Fort Wagner was then changed during the night, and Gen. Hagood assumed command. He was relieved by Col. Laurence M. Keitt, who commanded the fort until it was abandoned on September 7. Gen Hagood wrote a book titled Memoirs of the War of Secession, in which he states that the constant bombardment from the Union guns in the weeks following the second battle had unearthed such large numbers of the Union dead buried after the assault of July 18, and the air was so sickening with the smell of death, that one could no longer stand to be in the fort. The constant bombardment caused Confederate soldiers who were killed during the siege to be buried in the walls of Wagner, and they were also constantly being unearthed. Following the Union repulse, engineers besieged the fort. The Confederates abandoned the fort on September 7, 1863, after resisting 60 days of shelling, it having been deemed untenable because of the damage from constant bombardment, lack of provisions, and the close proximity of the Union siege trenches to Wagner. Battlefield preservation In May 2008, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) and partners, including the South Carolina Conservation Bank, the South Carolina State Ports Authority, the Civil War Trust, (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and many private donors, purchased the island on behalf of the City of Charleston from Ginn Resorts for $3 million. Trust for Public Lands announcement, May 30, 2008, \\"Historic Morris Island Preserved.\\" Accessed May 30, 2018. Previously, in 2003, when a builder announced his plans to build houses on the tract, for which he had an option to buy, the Trust, local preservationist Blake Hallman and others formed the Morris Island Coalition, generated media attention and support for preservation and defeated the effort. Ginn Resorts was interested in developing the property, too, but ultimately decided to purchase it and then immediately sell it to the preservationists.Bob Zeller, \\"Fighting the Second Civil War: A History of Battlefield Preservation and the Emergence of the Civil War Trust,\\" Knox Press, 2017. pp. 286‚Äì288.

The success of Britpop and musical acts such as the Spice Girls, Blur and Oasis led to a renewed feeling of optimism in the United Kingdom following the tumultuous years of the 1970s and 1980s. The name is a pun on the title of the British patriotic song \\"Rule, Britannia!\\" Origins of the term The phrase \\"Cool Britannia\\" was first used in 1967 as a song title by the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band (specifically, the first song in the debut album Gorilla and contained the lyric, ‚ÄúCool Britannia, Britannia you are cool/Take a trip!/Britons ever, ever, ever shall be hip.‚Äù The song thereby directly references the lyrics of \\"Rule Britannia\\".J. Ayto, Movers and Shakers: a Chronology of Words that Shaped our Age (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 233. The phrase \\"Cool Britannia\\" reappeared in early 1996 as a registered trade mark for one of Ben & Jerry's ice-creams ‚Äì which mixed vanilla, strawberries and ‚Äúfudge-covered shortbread‚Äù, and as used by the media and in advertising, it seemed to capture the cultural renaissance of London at the time (as celebrated in a 1996 Newsweek magazine cover headlined \\"London Rules\\"). The election of Tony Blair's Labour government in 1997, seen by some as young, cool and very appealing, got quite a lot of reflected glory of the feeling of euphoria and optimism.\\"Cool Britannia\\". BBC News. Retrieved 3 February 2015 The use of this term was similar to that of \\"Swinging London\\" for the boom in art, fashion and popular music during the early years of Harold Wilson's Labour government. Many of the creative industries labelled as Cool Britannia were avowedly inspired by the music, fashion and art of the 1960s. 1990s culture Time described \\"Cool Britannia\\" as the mid-1990s celebration of youth culture in the UK. To the extent that it had any real meaning, \\"Cool Britannia\\" referred to the transient fashionable London house scene: clubs included the Ministry of Sound and the underground Megatripolis at Heaven, 1990s bands such as Blur and Oasis, fashion designers, the Young British Artists and magazines. Cool Britannia also summed up the mood in Britain during the mid-1990s Britpop movement, when there was a resurgence of distinctive British rock and pop music from groups such as Oasis, Blur, Pulp, Suede, Supergrass, and Elastica, as well as the Spice Girls. The renewal in British pride (reinforced by the strong and uninterrupted growth of the British economy from 1993), was symbolised in imagery such as Noel Gallagher's Union Jack guitar and Geri Halliwell's skimpy Union Jack dress, worn at the 1997 Brit Awards.\\"Geri revisits Spice Girls' heyday in Union Jack dress\\". Hello!. Retrieved 3 February 2015 The Euro 96 football tournament, hosted in England, is also considered an event that encouraged a resurgence of patriotism, particularly in England. John Major, who was prime minister at the time, famously took credit (November 1996), accompanied with a press release issued by the Department of National Heritage: ‚ÄúOur fashion, music and culture are the envy of our European neighbours. This abundance of talent, together with our rich heritage, makes ‚ÄòCool Britannia‚Äô an obvious choice for visitors from all over the world.‚ÄùIndependent '96 With his high profile bouts world featherweight champion boxer ‚ÄùPrince‚Äù Naseem Hamed is also associated with the era, as are alcopops and Lads' Magazines. Released in 1994, Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), featuring one of the era's biggest stars, Hugh Grant, had been an early portent of the new wave of British cinema. Devised by screenwriter Richard Curtis, it set a pattern for British-set romantic comedies, including Sliding Doors (1998) and Notting Hill (1999), the latter also starring Grant. The first Austin Powers film, International Man of Mystery, co-starring Elizabeth Hurley (who was in a high profile relationship with Grant), was released in 1997, and with its Cool Britannia influenced take on the Swinging London era it instantly included itself in the same 1990s cultural moment. Danny Boyle‚Äôs 1996 film Trainspotting featured a Britpop-heavy soundtrack. In March 1997 Vanity Fair published a special edition on Cool Britannia with Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit on the cover; the title read 'London Swings! Again!'. Figures in the issues included Alexander McQueen, Damien Hirst, Graham Coxon and the editorial staff of Loaded. Tony Blair‚Äôs speech at the 1996 Labour party conference drew on the optimism of the Euro 96 football championships ‚Äì accompanied with the summer‚Äôs chart-topping anthem ‚ÄúThree Lions‚Äù. Alluding to the ‚Äúthirty years of hurt‚Äù lyric in the song (since England last won the World Cup), Blair stated, ‚ÄúSeventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming. Labour‚Äôs coming home.‚Äù After the Labour party won its landslide in 1997, there was even more enthusiasm. By 1998 The Economist was commenting that \\"many people are already sick of the phrase\\",Leaders: \\"Cool Britannia\\". The Economist, London: Mar 14, 1998. Vol. 346, Iss. 8059 and senior Labour politicians, such as Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, seemed embarrassed by its usage. By 2000 (after the decline of Britpop as a tangible genre) it was being used mainly in a mocking or ironic way. Two highlight DVDs, Later...

It was originally named Bonnington Park Academy in 1858. Since then, it has expanded and is now attended by 1,500 pupils from all over the Tweeddale area. The school was expanded in 2000 when The Millennium Wing was added. This expansion meant a great increase in size and capacity including a Learning Resource Centre and entire business suite. A new sports centre was completed in 2014. In 2013, the school was ranked 28th in Scotland for Higher exam passes.heraldscotland.com \\"Revealed: Scotland's best 50 schools for Higher exam passes\\" 19 December 2013 The school was damaged severely by a serious fire on 28 November 2019, which forced its closure for several weeks. Curriculum The school follows the standard Scottish curriculum with subjects ranging from Mathematics and English to newer subjects such as Business Management and Child Care. Sports Rugby and Hockey are popular sports at the school. However, students are encouraged to participate in a wide range of other sports including football, netball, mountain biking, swimming and athletics. History of the School = Incipience = The very first origins of Peebles High School date as far back as 1464 when a \\"scule and sculmaster\\" were appointed. Two centuries later there is evidence of \\"the establishment of the English School and the Grammar School of Peebles on Tweed Green\\". More recent history suggests the most immediate origins of Peebles High School was in 1858 when a private school, known then as Bonnington Park Academy for boys, was established. A private school for girls called St Leonards existed around that time and was hosted within the Parish Church Manse. By 1873 the roll of children in the local community totalled 538 between the ages of 5‚Äì13, 85% of whom were at school. To accommodate this increasing roll, an application was made to make the existing school a \\"Higher Class School\\" i.e. to teach beyond elementary level. In 1876 it was only one of 20 in Scotland to achieve this. Also in this year \\"young ladies\\" were finally allowed to enrol. This led to a change of name to\\" Peebles High School-Bonnington Park\\". Students came from all over the county. It was, however, a private school that consisted of a preparatory and upper school, the latter requiring an examination to permit a pupil to access. = Twentieth Century = In 1901 there were about 100 students in the \\"upper part of the school\\" now known as \\"Peebles and County High school\\". The Education Act of 1908 finally allowed grants to children allowing them to remain in school. By 1910 the school was a single story building consisting of a number of rooms off of a single corridor, where the science labs now exist. By 1927 there were approximately 200 pupils in the school and 12 staff, however by 1935 the Preparation department was closed and pupils transferred to Kingsland and Halyrude. Lack of accommodation beyond the age of 14 at these schools meant that a decision was made to expand the Burgh and County School in 1936. The new addition to the school known as the \\"36 block\\" was completed in 1938, This now meant all pupils over the age of 12 were expected to attend. There were extensive sports fields around the school, allowing a wide access to sport. The beginning of World War Two saw a large influx of evacuees to \\"safe\\" Peebles, adding six air raid shelters to the school playground and a necessity to turn playing fields into vegetable allotments. The Education Act of 1947 saw the roll increase to 400, as students were now to remain at school until age 15. At this time there was also an increase of students remaining into the 6th year. The next significant structural change, due to the pressure on accommodation and the leaving age increasing to age 16, was the \\"Tower, dining room and technical block\\". These were added at a cost of ¬£443,000 in 1970. Even then Modern studies and History resided in Huts which remained until 1999. There were as many as 13 huts at Peebles High School at this time. = Twenty-First Century = Due to the aforesaid pressure for space, the Millennium Wing was born, built behind the 36 block. This modern building consisted of an innovative two level development with an open and bright congregational space known as the \\"Atrium\\". By 2000 the school had over 80 teachers and in excess of 1000 pupils. By 2014, in an effort to increase access to sport, the school led an extensive campaign by the Head teacher and its community to generate a new, state of the art sports facility, funded in partnership with SBC and Sports Scotland, costing ¬£4.8m. This extended the sports curriculum and resulted in a Gold Level Award in recognition of what was now on offer not just to students but the whole community. = Fire in November, 2019 = On 28 November 2019, the art and the P.E. department were destroyed in a fire, with arson being the reported cause. All staff and students were evacuated safely. Later the same day, the fire was brought under control. Extensive reconstruction of the damaged parts of the school will be required. The affected buildings date back to the 1930s and therefore offered little resistance to an such an intense blaze.

The museum was first founded in 1905 as the association Det gamle Christiania. Initiator and committee leader until 1912 was architect Fritz Holland (1874-1959). A committee members included Bishop of Oslo Anton Christian Bang, architects Torolf Prytz and Harald Olsen, artist Eilif Peterssen and military officer Thomas Heftye. The museum moved into the main building at Frogner Manor in 1909. Oslo City Museum was a private association until the end of 2005. In 2006 it became part of the newly established Oslo Museum, together with two other museums; the Intercultural Museum and the Theatre Museum. Oslo Museum is now headquartered at Frogner Manor.Frogner Manor House (Visit Oslo) Oslo City Museum has an extensive library with the purpose of documenting the history of the City of Oslo, as well as the former municipality Aker. Particularly valuable is the museum's art collection and photo collection with Oslo motifs and portraits. The museum has one of the largest and most important photo collections in Norway. Additionally the museum has an art collection which contains around 1,000 paintings and around 6,000 other works.About Oslo Museum (Bymuseet) (Oslo Museum) References External links *Oslo City Museum - Official site Category:Museums in Oslo Category:Photography archives in Norway Category:City museums in Norway Category:Local museums in Norway Category:Art museums and galleries in Norway ","title":"Oslo City Museum"},{"id":"1896643","title":"Steve Williams (wrestler)"},{"id":"1896655","text":"Robbie the Reindeer is a series of three animated comedy television specials co-produced by the BBC and charity Comic Relief which aired on BBC One between Christmas 1999 and 2007. Although the series is distributed commercially by BBC Studios, and has been sold to more than 30 countries internationally, the entirety of their net profits from the series go to Comic Relief. The first two specials were animated in stop motion by the BBC Bristol animation unit, while the third was a CGI animation by Absolute Digital Pictures. Robbie the Reindeer was created by Richard Curtis, who also was executive producer of the first two specials and co-wrote Hooves of Fire. The programmes follow Robbie, a reindeer who travels to the North Pole to follow in the footsteps of his father Rudolph and join Santa's sleigh team, his encounters with the vengeful Blitzen and his relationship with love interest Donner. Characters * Ardal O'Hanlon as Robbie: The easy-going and childlike son of Rudolph whose nose acts as a tracking device. He is the captain of the sleigh team. * Paul Whitehouse as Prancer: An upbeat and slow-witted reindeer that befriends Robbie. * Jane Horrocks as Donner: A support member of the sleigh team and Robbie's love interest. The name is a play on the British pronunciation of the feminine name 'Donna'. Reindeer, unlike other members of the deer family, have antlers in both sexes, so that both Donner and Vixen can be accurately portrayed as female. * Steve Coogan as Blitzen: The former captain of the sleigh team who is envious of Rudolph's popularity (so much so that he won't let anyone speak his name in his presence) and plots to \\"destroy\\" Robbie as revenge. * Harry Enfield as Old Jingle: The reindeer that trained Rudolph and prepares Robbie for The Reindeer Games. * Alistair McGowan as Des Yeti and Alan Snowman: Commentators for The Reindeer Games. The characters are parodies of presenter Des Lynam and football commentator Alan Hansen, who both starred on BBC One's Match of the Day in the 1990s. * Rudolph: A former member of the sleigh team and Robbie's father who once \\"saved the day\\" for Santa and as a result is popular enough to have merchandise and a song named after him. He is never named or seen onscreen (apart from a painting of him in the sleigh team's home) and a running gag sees any character who attempts to say his name immediately interrupted by Blitzen. This has been attributed to a copyright dispute in which the film makers were unable to obtain permission to use the copyright to the name 'Rudolph.' List of specials Release =American Dub= The programme was first shown in the United States on Fox Family with the original British voices until 2001. In 2002, CBS acquired the rights to the first two specials and recorded new dialog with American actors. The American cast included: Ben Stiller (Robbie), Britney Spears (Donner), James Woods (Narrator, Viking 1), Brad Garrett (Prancer), Hugh Grant (Blitzen, largely imitating Coogan's original characterization), Leah Remini (Vixen, Koala), Jerry Stiller (Old Jingle), Dick Enberg (Des Yeti), Dan Dierdorf (Allan Snowman), Grey DeLisle (Mrs. Santa, Arctic Fox, Female Viking), Rob Paulsen (Head Elf, Viking 2/4), and Jim Belushi (Santa, Little Magnus). CBS stopped showing the program after the 2005 holiday season, after which Nicktoons Network aired the original British version for two years. In 2016, CBS began airing the first two specials again using the American dub. \\"Close Encounters of the Herd Kind\\" has not, as of 2020, been dubbed nor made available in the United States. In addition to the dub, the first two specials have been aired as a single hour long (i.e. 45 minutes + advertisements) special in America, cutting around fifteen minutes of material from the original versions. One of the most obvious edits is the removal of the scene where Robbie actually discovers the vikings in the first place. The US DVD is uncut, alternate credits aside, and has the original British dialog as an alternate audio track. =Home Video= In the United Kingdom, Hooves of Fire was released on DVD on 27 November 2000. A \\"Collector's Edition\\" release adding Legend of the Lost Tribe followed on 24 November 2003 and a collection of all three specials, subtitled The Whole Herd, was released on 2 November 2009. The 2009 release contained the special features from previous releases, including a 5.1 sound mix on Hooves of Fire, directors commentary on the first two specials, the complete Hooves storyboard, behind the scenes footage and an interview with Peter Peake. In the United States, Hooves of Fire was originally released on DVD on 4 September 2001, containing the British voice cast and the same extras as the UK release. A DVD adding Legend of the Lost Tribe was released on 7 October 2003, this time containing both the British and American dialog tracks; This release also contained the extras from the UK edition, with the exception of the 5.1 mix and storyboards for Hooves of Fire.
