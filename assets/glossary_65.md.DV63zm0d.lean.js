The original lineup consisted of two brothers, Brandon (vocals, bass guitar and keyboards) and Benjamin Curtis (guitar and backing vocals), and Josh Garza (drums). Benjamin left the band in March 2007 to focus on his work with School of Seven Bells, and was replaced on guitar by Phil Karnats. The re-activated band is a two piece with the remaining members being Brandon Curtis and Josh Garza History=Early years Before forming Secret Machines, the members played in various Dallas bands such as UFOFU, Captain Audio, Comet, When Babies Eat Pennies, and Tripping Daisy. Captain Audio was formed by Garza and vocalist/guitarist/chief songwriter Regina Chellew in the late 1990s as a two- piece noise duo. Brandon‚Äîand occasionally Ben‚ÄîCurtis joined soon after as the original duo began to develop a more standard rock sound. In a little over a year they had recorded and released the EP My Ears Are Ringing But My Heart's OK (1999) and the full-length Luxury or Whether It Is Better To Be Loved than Feared (2000). Shortly after the release of Luxury the band went on extended hiatus and eventually disbanded when Garza and the Curtis brothers moved to New York, leaving Chellew in Dallas to form the band Chao and later join indie pop outfit The Happy Bullets. September 000 and Now Here Is Nowhere The band first recorded their EP September 000 in Chicago, six weeks after forming. Upon moving to New York the band developed their sound and signed to Warner Brothers. In 2004, Secret Machines released their first full-length CD, Now Here Is Nowhere. The album was released online for purchase well ahead of the physical release, an uncommon decision which helped garner additional press coverage. The song \\"Nowhere Again\\", from their debut album, was used in promotional spots for American during its launch, and appeared in the 2006 video game Driver: Parallel Lines. The album was received well critically with a composite 80 out of 100 rating from critics compiled by Metacritic. Their second EP, The Road Leads Where It's Led, was released on June 7, 2005. The EP includes a re-recording of the song \\"The Road Leads Where It's Led\\", which originally appeared on the debut full-length. Secret Machines opened for Interpol during their 2004 tour in support of the album. In 2005, Secret Machines opened for Oasis in Europe and co-headlined a US tour with Kings of Leon. Marfa Mystery Lights: A concert for the UFO's French director Charles De Meaux teamed up with the band for a film set in the Texas town of Marfa and included footage of the band recording new material and included an outdoor \\"concert\\" at night. One of these two songs was \\"Marfa Song\\" is exclusively available in the film. Ten Silver Drops and Ben's departure In 2006, Ten Silver Drops, their second album, leaked onto file sharing websites following the release of their lead single \\"Alone, Jealous and Stoned\\" in the UK. The album was once again received favorably. The album received a composite 75 out of 100 on Metacritic composite rating. In 2006, the band toured heavily, including opening for U2 for three dates in Mexico. Following the album's release, the band were interviewed for radio by David Bowie, who was a fan of the band. Benjamin Curtis left the band on March 3, 2007, to focus full-time on his new band, School of Seven Bells. The news was posted by Brandon Curtis on the Secret Machines' message board. On December 29, 2013, Benjamin Curtis died of lymphoma in New York City at the age of 35. Third album and later years After Ben's departure from the band, Secret Machines played two shows in New York, one at the Annex, and the other at the newly opened Highline Ballroom. At these shows, the band played mostly new material to be put on their next album. They included two new members: Blasco (Interpol's touring keyboardist) on guitar, keyboards, and bass, and ex- Tripping Daisy member Phil E. Karnats on guitar. Since these shows, Karnats has become the official guitarist of the band, replacing Ben. The band finished recording quickly during May 2007 and released a new, self-titled album in the United States on October 14, 2008, on their newly formed TSM recording and distributed by Worlds Fair Records. Karnats announced on his MySpace blog that he recorded guitar parts for the album and would continue to play live with the band. In 2010, a new single \\"Like I Can\\" along with \\"A terrible light\\" was released digitally, and Brandon Curtis announced plans for a new Secret Machines album, to be titled The Moth, The Lizard and The Secret Machines. This album remains un released.Interview , Azltron.com, February 5, 2010. Accessed January 19, 2013. While no official announcement was made, the band was inactive since 2010.

He was the founder of the town of Bellvue northwest of Fort Collins. Biography Prior to the American Civil War, Flowers owned and operated three river boats along the Ohio River carrying passengers between Marietta, Ohio and St. Louis, Missouri. After two of his boats were destroyed in a sudden storm, he took the remaining boat and sailed down the Ohio to St. Louis, then up the Missouri River to Kansas City, Kansas, where he settled with his family in Wyandotte (now part of Kansas City). In 1873 he organized the Wyandotte Colony, a party of settlers, and led them west to the Colorado Territory to settle at the Union Colony at Greeley, which had been founded three years early as a religiously-oriented agricultural cooperative. Flowers was not contented at the Union Colony, however, and he relocated later that year upstream on the Cache la Poudre River to just west of Fort Collins, in an area just west of the Dakota Hogback known as Pleasant Valley. The valley had been settled by white homesteaders starting in 1860, and the area just south of the town near Stout (under present-day Horsetooth Reservoir) was the location of stone quarries developed by the Union Pacific Railroad. Flowers established and platted the town of Bellvue in the valley. In 1880, Flowers founded a general store in Bellvue to cater to the quarry workers and their families. He built a one-story sandstone building to house a general store. The building, which still stands, later became the local meeting of the Grange in the 20th century and today is known as the \\"Bellvue Grange\\". On June 24, 1884, he opened the first post office in Bellvue at his store. Flowers also built a horse racing track and grandstand for community gathers, dog and pony shows, and traveling medicine shows. He developed and garden and raised pigs for unfortunate families of quarry workers, a generosity that earned him the name \\"Uncle Jacob\\" in the local press during his lifetime. He also surveyed a road through the foothills west of Bellvue south of Rist Canyon. The road was widely used for passage along the south bank of the Poudre River, as well as to access the timber in the foothills. The road was eventually extended over Lulu Pass and became known as the Flowers Road. It fell into disuse after the construction of present-day State Highway 14 through the Poudre Canyon. The road is sporadically marked as a foot trail through the foothills in the Roosevelt National Forest.

The Adventures of Herg√© (Drawn and Quarterly, 2011). Casterman was originally a printing company and publishing house. In 1934, Casterman took over the Le Petit Vingti√®me editions for the publication of the albums of The Adventures of Tintin, from the fourth album of the series, Cigars of the Pharaoh. From 1942, Casterman published reworked versions and colored versions of the previous Tintin albums. Strengthened by the success of Herg√©'s comics, shortly after, Casterman proposed new series with new authors such as Jacques Martin, Fran√ßois Craenhals and C. & V. Hansen. From 1954 on, Casterman published children's books, as well, including the successful Martine books by Marcel Marlier and the Cadet- Rama books written by Alain Gree (units Achille et Bergamote and Petit Tom). Keen to appeal to a more mature market, Casterman decided in 1973 to publish the first albums of Corto Maltese by the Italian author Hugo Pratt. Furthermore, in 1978, Casterman established its monthly magazine A Suivre, which was to influence the comics revival of the 1980s. Casterman ceased the publication of A Suivre in 1997. Casterman is now part of Groupe Flammarion. Casterman's manga series are published under the imprint Sakka.

The film is the second film in the Pusher trilogy, portraying the lives of criminals in Copenhagen. Plot The film opens some time after the original film with Tonny serving out his last day of a prison sentence. His cell-mate delivers a monologue advising Tonny to conquer his fear. He then reminds Tonny that he owes him money, but has chosen to give him more time out of respect for Tonny's father, the Duke, a vicious gangster. Upon his release, Tonny visits his father's garage business seeking employment. The Duke has a younger son from a different mother now and receives Tonny coldly, but he ultimately allows Tonny to work for him on a trial basis. Tonny steals a Ferrari in an effort to impress his father, but the car is rejected and the Duke berates Tonny mercilessly for his lack of responsibility. While hanging out with his friend √ò, Tonny is told that he has a child with a local woman Charlotte. Charlotte has raised the child by herself so far and demands that Tonny start paying her child support. Tonny makes empty promises to pay, but soon comes to care for the child. Tonny successfully participates in a car heist for the Duke, but is forced to ride in the trunk of the escape car because there are no seats left. Tonny helps a local pimp and hoodlum, \\"Kurt the Cunt\\", make a heroin deal with Milo, the drug lord from the first movie. When one of Milo's thugs arrives late, a spooked Kurt flushes the heroin down the toilet. Kurt now has no money or drugs to sell and cannot pay back the money he borrowed for the deal. Kurt convinces Tonny to help buy him a gun and shoot him in the arm to convince Kurt's backers that he was robbed. While visiting with Charlotte and his son, Tonny learns how to change his son's diaper. √ò watches and reveals that he is about to marry his girlfriend Gry and have a child of his own. At √ò's wedding reception, the Duke delivers a toast telling √ò that he thinks of him as a son, and then chides Tonny. Tonny gets drunk and becomes angry as he watches Charlotte neglecting their child to snort cocaine with Gry in the club's kitchen. He insists that she take the baby home, but she refuses by berating and humiliating Tonny. Enraged, Tonny attacks Charlotte before several men pull him away. Realizing that he has once again made a fool of himself, Tonny leaves the party and meets Kurt, who is lingering outside. Kurt convinces Tonny to help him smash up his apartment to further support their story. In return Kurt promises to put in a good word for Tonny with the Duke. After Kurt attacks a prostitute that emerges from his bedroom, he tells Tonny he is going to finish her off and Tonny, wanting no part of it, leaves. Kurt reveals that his financial backer is the Duke and that he has lied so that Tonny will share in Kurt's debt. Tonny visits his father to find a way to reconcile and pay off his debt. Tonny volunteers to intimidate the Duke's ex- wife Jeanette, who is trying to take custody of his young half-brother, to force her to drop the custody claim. The Duke is hesitant to give the job to Tonny, but his brother Red vouches for Tonny because he did well during the car heist. The Duke insists that Tonny kill Jeanette, and he agrees. Tonny visits Jeanette where she works, at Kurt's brothel, but he cannot go through with the murder. After returning and admitting his failure to his father, the Duke berates him savagely. Tonny snaps and viciously stabs the Duke to death. He flees and goes looking for √ò, but instead finds Gry and Charlotte getting high. They deride Tonny and then leave the baby unattended. Tonny takes the child and gets on a bus, fleeing the city. The film ends with a shot of the tattoo on the back of Tonny's head which reads \\"Respect\\".

Metacritic gave an average score of 78 out of 100, indicating \\"Generally favorable reviews\\".http://www.metacritic.com/movie/pusher-ii-with-blood-on-my- hands Soundtrack The soundtrack was composed by Peter Peter, in collaboration with Peter Kyed and performed by Peter Peter's band The Bleeder Group. The soundtrack uses an updated version of the \\"Pusher theme\\" composed by Peter Peter and Povl Kristian for the first film. Nicolas Winding Refn arranged a competition, the \\"Pusher II Soundtrack Hunt\\", in collaboration with GAFFA and the website Mymusic, to find diegetic music to use in the film. Among the tracks chosen was Sad Disco by Keli Hlodversson. Sequel This movie is the second film in a trilogy of Pusher films written and directed by Refn. Each film takes place in the same fictional Copenhagen underworld. The original Pusher follows Tonny's original partner Frank (Kim Bodnia), and his desperate attempt to raise money after a drug deal gone wrong. Pusher II references the events of this film several times. Charlotte comments on the scars on Tonny's head, a result of the beating he received from Frank. Milo later asks Tonny if he has seen Frank lately, as Milo wanted to kill Frank at the end of Pusher. This comment reveals that Frank disappeared after the events of that film, but it's not mentioned if he fled or if Milo killed him. The third film in the trilogy is Pusher 3, which follows the Serbian drug lord Milo as he struggles with his drug addiction, several bad drug deals, and his daughter's birthday celebration.

At least two P538s were built with the Chevrolet Corvette's 327-cu.in. V8 engines and two more with 4.0 and 3.5-litre Lamborghini V12 engines. Five-speed manual transaxles were used, with gearing specific to the race for which each car was constructed. Braking was via inboard four wheel disc brakes, with a fully independent suspension. The body was made of fiberglass over a tubular steel chassis. The first V8-powered car debuted at Le Mans in 1966, with Swiss drivers Edgar Berney and Andre Wicky, but records indicate both retired after three hours with a cooling problem. A second team in a production-based Bizzarrini A3/C, driven by Sam Posey and Massimo Natili, was disqualified after a pit lane violation, possibly while returning with serious frame damage. American Ferrari driver Mike Gammino then commissioned a Lamborghini 4.0-liter V12 powered car, which he raced once. The workshop of Neri and Bonacini and bodywork company BBM were involved in constructing this car. Bizzarrini attempted to build a second, 3.5-litre V12 car for Le Mans, but was unable to complete it before bankruptcy. Continuation P538s Beginning in the mid-1970s and continuing at least through the 1990s, former Bizzarrini engineer Salvatore Diomante at Autocostruzione SD, Torino, began building continuation P538s on commission for private buyers. These may be distinguished from 1960s-built cars by the use of square as opposed to round tubing. Giotto Bizzarrini and his wife likely assisted in construction of the early cars, and they were built using some original Sixties Bizzarrini components as available. The first two cars of this series using square-tube construction bear serial numbers #002 and #003; the 3.5-litre V12 Van Horneff car also uses serial #002, and was last known to be located in England. Engines vary, but include Chevrolet V8s, Lamborghini V12s and possibly a six-cylinder Fiat. Diomante constructed an unknown number, using original fiberglass body molds, probably fewer than 8. The surviving P538s Even Bizzarrini‚Äôs ‚Äúproduction‚Äù A3/C and 5300 GT road cars are often obscure in origin; today, neither Bizzarrini nor Gammino are entirely clear on what happened more than 40 years ago. However, both agree that there has been no correct accounting of the P538s. There are definitely two surviving V8 and two V12 cars; there may be as many as four more V8 cars. Chevrolet V8 powered cars Bizzarrini used the first P538 built for development work in the beginning of 1966, and it probably crashed that winter. The car that appeared at Le Mans four months later may have been this car; it may have been a second car; or more likely, it reused any and all salvageable parts of the original car, whatever those were. In 1967, Bizzarrini rebodied at least one V8 as a coupe and sold it to the Duke of Aosta (it is known as the Duca d‚ÄôAosta coupe). Some sources suggest this was a third V8 car, possibly constructed as a second 1967 Le Mans entry. Another, possibly the 1966 Le Mans car, was also rebodied; it ended up in the hands of Giugiaro at ItalDesign; he rebodied it a third time (at least) as his Manta show car. Both the Duca d‚ÄôAosta and ItalDesign cars have remained in those configurations, and are the only V8s that can be reliably confirmed as Bizzarrinis built in the 1960s. Lamborghini V12 powered cars Mike Gammino‚Äôs 4.0-litre car, often called 001 but actually un-numbered, was completed in 1965, after which he imported it into the US. He ran it once at Bridgehampton, where ‚Äúwe had some problems with it.‚Äù He gave it to his mechanic Libero Gerardi, and after his death, it passed through a series of owners until it landed at the San Diego Automotive Museum. The other V12 P538 uses a Lamborghini 3.5-liter engine and is stamped P538 002 on a front stabilizer. It was built for the 1967 Le Mans 24h but never completed. According to an interview with Sir Stirling Moss, the transaxle casing appears to be identical to an Alfa Romeo Tipo. Disassembled by Bizzarrini by 1970, he finished it as a commission in 1974 or 1975. It is currently owned by American Van Horneff.

It explores the Crown Heights riot (which occurred in Crown Heights, Brooklyn in August 1991) and its aftermath through the viewpoints of African-American and Jewish people, mostly based in New York City, who were connected directly and indirectly to the riot. Fires in the Mirror is composed of monologues taken directly by Smith from transcripts of the interviews she conducted with the people whom she portrays in the play. She interviewed more than 100 individuals in the course of creating this play. It is considered a pioneering example of the genre known as verbatim theatre. It received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show. Context Anna Deavere Smith's play Fires in the Mirror is a part of her project On the Road: A Search for the American Character. It is a series of monologues which she has created from interviews. Fires in the Mirror chronicles the Crown Heights riot in Brooklyn, New York in August 1991. In that racially divided neighborhood, populated largely by African Americans and Chabad Hasidic Jews, a car driven by a Jewish man veered onto a sidewalk and struck two children, killing Gavin Cato, a 7-year-old Caribbean-American boy. The death, and what the African-American community perceived as a delayed response of city emergency medical personnel, sparked protests by them in the neighborhood. During these, a group of black youths attacked and fatally injured Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student visiting from Australia. Days of rioting ensued, exposing to national scrutiny the depth of the racial divisions in Crown Heights. The rioting resulted in 190 injuries, 129 arrests, and an estimated one million dollars in property damage. Smith interviewed residents of Crown Heights, including participants in the disturbances, as well as leading politicians, writers, musicians, religious leaders, and intellectuals. From this material, she chose which figures to highlight and speeches to use in the monologues of her play. Through the words of 26 different people, in 29 monologues, Smith explores how and why these people signaled their identities, how they perceived and responded to people different from themselves, and how barriers between groups can be breached. \\"My sense is that American character lives not in one place or the other\\", Smith writes in her introduction to the play, \\"but in the gaps between the places, and in our struggle to be together in our differences.\\" The title of the play suggests a vision of art as a site of reflection where the passions and fires of a specific moment can be examined from a new angle, contemplated, and better understood.Smith, Anna Deavere.

Synopsis The play is a series of monologues based on interviews conducted by Smith with people involved in the Crown Heights crisis, both directly and as observers and commentators. Each scene is titled with the person's name and a key phrase from that interview. There are a total of 29 monologues in Fires in the Mirror and each one focuses on a character's opinion and point of view of the events and issues surrounding the crisis. Most characters have one monologue; the Reverend Al Sharpton, Letty Cottin Pogrebin and Norman Rosenbaum have two monologues each. Fires in the Mirror is divided into themed sections. The themes include elements of personal identity, differences in physical appearance, differences in race, and the feelings toward the riot incidents. The overall arc of the play flows from broad personal identity issues, to physical identity, to issues of race and ethnicity, and finally ending in issues relating to the Crown Heights riot. The play is structured as follows: ;Identity *The Desert ‚Äì Ntozake Shange discusses Identity in terms of the self fitting into the community as a whole and the feeling of being separate from others but still somewhat a part of the whole. *Static ‚Äì An anonymous Lubavitcher woman tells a humorous story of getting a young black boy from the neighborhood to turn off their radio during the Sabbath because no one in their family was allowed to. *101 Dalmatians ‚Äì George C. Wolfe talks about racial identity and argues that \\"blackness\\" is extremely different from \\"whiteness\\" ;Mirrors *Mirrors and Distortions ‚Äì Aaron M. Bernstein intellectually theorizes how mirrors can distort images both scientifically and in literature. ;Hair *Look in the Mirror ‚Äì An anonymous girl talks about how racial identity is extremely important in her school and the girls act, dress, and wear their hair according to the racial groups. *Me and James's Thing ‚Äì Al Sharpton explains that he promised James Brown he would always wear his hair straightened and that it was not due to anything racial. *Wigs ‚Äì Rivkah Siegal discusses the difficulty behind the custom of wearing wigs. She focuses on how she feels like she is not herself and that she is fake. ;Race *Rope ‚Äì Angela Davis talks about the changes in history of Blacks and Whites and then continuing need to find ways to come together as people. ;Rhythm *Rhythm and Poetry ‚Äì Rapper Monique Matthews discusses the perception of rap and the attitude toward women in the hip-hop culture. She explains the need for women in that culture to be more confident and not accept being viewed as sexual objects. ;Seven Verses *Roots ‚Äì Leonard Jeffries describes his involvement in Roots, a television series about African-American family histories and the slave trade. *Near Enough to Reach ‚Äì Letty Cottin Pogrebin says that blacks attack Jews because Jews are the only ones that listen to them and do not simply ignore their attacks. *Seven Verses ‚Äì Minister Conrad Mohammed theorizes and explains that blacks are God's \\"chosen people\\", and expresses his views on the suffering of blacks at the hands of white people. *Isaac ‚Äì Pogrebin talks about her uncle Isaac, a Holocaust survivor, who was forced by the Nazis to load his wife and children onto a train headed for the gas chambers. *Lousy Language ‚Äì Robert Sherman explains that words like \\"bias\\" and \\"discrimination\\" are not specific enough, leading to poor communication. ;Crown Heights, Brooklyn, August 1991 *No Blood in His Feet ‚Äì Rabbi Joseph Spielman describes the riot events; he believes that blacks lied about the events surrounding the death of the boy Cato in order to start anti-Semitic riots. He focuses on the malicious intent of the black kids who stabbed Rosenbaum. *Mexican Standoff ‚Äì The Reverend Canon Doctor Heron Sam says that he feels the Jewish community was unconcerned with the killing of Cato. *Wa Wa Wa ‚Äì Anonymous Young Man #1 explains his view on the differences of police contact with the Jewish and Black communities, and how he thinks there is no justice for blacks as Jews are never arrested. *\\"Heil Hitler\\" ‚Äì Michael S. Miller argues that the black community is extremely anti-Semitic. *Knew How to Use Certain Words ‚Äì Henry Rice describes his personal involvement in the events and the injustice he suffered. *My Brother's Blood ‚Äì Norman Rosenbaum speaks at a rally about wanting justice for his brother's murder, and says that he doesn't believe the police are doing all that they can. *Sixteen Hours Difference ‚Äì Norman Rosenbaum talks about first hearing the news of his brother's death. *Bad Boy ‚Äì Anonymous Young Man #2 explains that the black kid who was blamed for Rosenbaum's murder was an athlete and therefore would not have killed anyone *Chords ‚Äì Sonny Carson describes his personal contributions in the black community, and how he is trying to teach blacks to act against the white power structure. *Ovens ‚Äì Rabbi Shea Hecht does not believe integration is the solution to the problems of race relations. *Rain ‚Äì Al Sharpton talks about trying to sue the driver who hit Gavin Cato, and complains about bias in the judicial system and the media. *Rage ‚Äì Richard Green says that there are no role models for black youths, leading to rage among them. *The Coup ‚Äì Roslyn Malamud blames the police and black leaders for letting the events and crisis get out of control. *Pogroms ‚Äì Reuven Ostrov describes how Jews got scared because there are \\"Jew-haters\\" everywhere. *Lingering ‚Äì Carmel Cato closes the play by describing the trauma of seeing his son die, and his resentment toward powerful Jews. Style Fires in the Mirror is a collection of multiple voices and points of view. It is a hybrid of theater and journalism. Smith provides information as to where each interview was done, including the settings and environment, other people who were near, and when the interviews took place. This emphasizes the fact that the play was drawn from the words of people who were directly involved with events. The play is written as verse. Smith uses lines, ellipses, and other notation, to express how people expressed themselves in each interview. Fires in the Mirror is a postmodern play. According to David Rush, characteristics of a postmodern play include the minimization of a single \\"author\\"; its purpose is to engage the audience rather than express one point of view. There may be multiple narratives interacting with each other, the structure departs from the conventional play pattern, and the play is usually fragmented. Fires in the Mirror encompasses all of these characteristics. Themes=Racial tensions The central focus of Fires in the Mirror is the resentment anger between two ethnic groups in the densely populated area of Crown Heights, Brooklyn, in New York City: the Lubavitcher Orthodox Jewish community and the African-American community. The monologues refer to such historic events as The Holocaust of World War II and slavery history of the United States, defining periods for each ethnic group. In addition, they express the often- fraught relationships between the two ethnic groups and the police, as well as the perceptions of the relationships between each other. Individual identity and attitudes By showing many different points of view and opinions on the issue of the riot, the play highlights that there are not just two sides, divided by race, but rather many different individual attitudes, emotions, and opinions. Staging Fires in the Mirror is staged as a one- person play. In the original production, there was no real physical set and Deavere used a limited number of props and costumes. Black-and-white photographs were displayed behind Smith as she moved from one monologue and character to the next. She slightly changed her appearance and mannerisms for each character. Throughout most of her performance, she was dressed in black pants and white shirt, and was barefoot. Many of the monologues are accompanied by music, ranging from black hip hop to Jewish religious chants. The music is meant to pair with the author's background or the essence of each monologue. Production history Smith presented a first workshop production of the play in December 1991 at George Wolfe's Festival of New Voices. Fires in the Mirror had its world premiere at the New York Shakespeare Festival on May 1, 1992. Its official press opening was on May 12, 1992. Fires in the Mirror has also been produced by the American Repertory Theatre in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey; Brown University, Stanford University, Royal Court Theatre in London, and many others. It was presented as part of the 1994 Melbourne International Arts Festival in Australia at the Victorian Arts Centre (now Arts Centre Melbourne). Television film A film of the play was adapted under the direction of George C. Wolfe and starred Anna Deavere Smith. Aired in 1993, it was produced by Cherie Fortis and filmed by \\"American Playhouse\\" for PBS. Awards It received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show in 1993. In 1994, Deavere received the award again, for her Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, another example of verbatim theatre, based on the 1992 Los Angeles riots.

It provides network visibility and network recording products to large organizations. The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2005 and then delisted in 2013 when it was acquired by Emulex.NSS Labs Q3 2010 Product Test Endace Core100 In 2016 Endace was spun out of Emulex and is currently a private company. In October 2016, The Intercept revealed that some Endace clients were intelligence agencies, including the British GCHQ (known for conducting massive surveillance on network communications) and the Moroccan DGST, likewise known for mass surveillance of its citizens. Background and history Endace was founded after the DAG project at the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Waikato in New Zealand. The first cards designed at the University were intended to measure latency in ATM networks. In 2006, Endace transitioned from component manufacturer to appliance manufacturer to managed infrastructure provider. The company now sells network visibility fabrics, based on its range of network recorders, to large corporations and government agencies. Endace was the first New Zealand company to list on London's Alternative Investment Market when it floated in mid-June 2005Growth Business: Endace poised to take AIM a move which was not without controversy. Poor share price performance in the early years and a seeming failure to attract a broad enough shareholder base lent weight to the criticism that Endace should have focused initially on developing its local profile (via NZX) rather than pushing for overseas investment (via London AIM). Endace is headquartered in Auckland, New Zealand, and has an R&D; centre in Hamilton, New Zealand, and offices in Australia, United States and Great Britain. Key innovations of the DAG The DAG project grew from academic research at Waikato University. Having found that software measurements of ATM cells (or packets) were unsatisfactory, both for reasons of accuracy and lack of certainty about packet loss, the research group set about developing their own hardware to generate better quality recordings. This hardware and its subsequent iterations introduced two fundamental innovations: hardware timestamping and hardware accounting for packet loss. Hardware timestamping Conventionally, each packet or cell is given a timestamp by the host machine's kernel (i.e. in software) when the kernel driver is notified that a new packet has arrived. This approach results in poor quality timestamps for several reasons, among them the considerable latency and jitter between the packet arriving at the network interface and receipt by the kernel driver and uncertainty caused by interrupt coalescing wherein one host interrupt signifies the arrival of several packets. Such poor quality limits what research can usefully be done on network performance and related fields. To solve this, the DAG generates timestamps in the hardware as close to the network interface as possible. Not only does this obviate latency, jitter and problems caused by interrupt coalescing, the hardware is capable of much greater accuracy and precision than software-generated timestamps. Precision comes from the freedom of custom hardware to assign as many bits to the timestamp as required and accuracy is assured by reference to an external time source such as GPS which is accurate to ¬± 40 nanoseconds. In contrast, the accuracy of NTP (by which kernel clocks can be corrected over the Internet) is in the order of milliseconds (about 100,000 times less accurate), depending on the conditions involved. The DAG produces 64 bit timestamps in fixed-point format with 32 fractional bits, giving a potential precision of 2^{-32} seconds or 233 picoseconds. The actual precision offered varies with the particular model of DAG, the oldest giving 24 fractional bits (60 nanoseconds) and better precisions offered in DAGs for higher bandwidth networks. The timestamp is derived from a free-running clock provided by a crystal oscillator but the accuracy of crystals drift with both temperature and age. The DAG's solution is to use direct digital synthesis using the 1 Hz pulse- per-second output that many GPS receivers provide as its reference clock. This mechanism is described in ¬ß5.5.3 of Stephen Donnelly's PhD thesis which also describes in detail the pre-commercial era models of DAG. Crucially, and an academically significant contribution of the DAG, the ability to use an external reference such as globally synchronised GPS makes it possible to do one-way time-of-flight measurements. This is of immense interest to academic researchers because packets flowing between two points on the Internet are neither guaranteed to follow the same path in each direction nor guaranteed to have the same timing characteristics in each direction. Outside of the academic world, timestamp accuracy has commercial applications in the enforcement and compliance with law such as the EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2004. Packet loss Almost as important as timestamp accuracy is guaranteeing 100% cell or packet capture and, where loss is unavoidable, knowing not only that packets have been lost but where. The \\"where\\" is important because, when analysing a packet trace, it's important to be able to compensate for lost packets when calculating inter-arrival times. Most commercial NICs keep a count of dropped packets, but they can't indicate where packets were lost. The DAG prepends a header which, amongst other things, indicates how many packets were dropped between that packet and the previously accepted packet. The DAG is also engineered to deliver recorded packets to the host with the greatest possible efficiency. That, together with the interstitial loss counter, is what makes the DAG so appealing for surveillance applications. The interstitial loss counter also finds application in forensics; a prosecutor needs to be able to prove that the record is complete or, if it is not, where it is not.  Controversy and surveillance  In October 2016, The Intercept published an article showing that Endace customers include intelligence agencies, including the GCHQ, Canadian and Australian intelligence agencies, and the DGST (Morocco‚Äôs domestic surveillance agency). Edward Snowden documents have shown that the GCHQ has installed massive surveillance of network communications in UK, using the over-sea cable between Europe and North America.  Awards  In March 2020, Endace received awards for \\"Most Innovative\\", \\"Best Product\\" and \\"Hot Company\\" categories at the Cyber Defense Magazine InfoSec Awards. Also in March 2020, Endace was awarded the \\"Grand Trophy Winner\\" for winning several categories in the Info Security Products Guide Global Excellence Awards.

Career King graduated from Rampart High School in Colorado Springs in 1983. He was drafted first overall by Pittsburgh in the 1986 June Amateur Draft, after playing college ball at the University of Arkansas. He played his 1987‚Äì88 seasons with the Eastern Leagues Harrisburg Senators before being promoted to Pittsburgh. King was a key part of the Pirates Division Championship teams of 1990, 1991, and 1992, batting 6th right after Barry Bonds, Andy Van Slyke and Bobby Bonilla. He was plagued by back injuries which forced Bonilla to play third base during the 1990 NLCS. King was then traded after a career-best 1996 season to Kansas City with Jay Bell for Joe Randa. In two full seasons with the Royals, he hit 28 and 24 home runs. King was the Royals regular first baseman at the beginning of the 1999 season, but, bothered by back problems, he abruptly announced his retirement on May 23, 1999, two days after going 1‚Äì4 against the Texas Rangers.

The company is built primarily on the work of Richard Tucholka, its founder and president. Company history Tri Tac Games was founded in 1978 as \\"Tacky Tack Games\\". Tri Tac is one of several small companies that rode the wave of interest in RPGs beginning in the 1970s with TSR's Dungeons & Dragons. The company's first product was the humorous microgame Geriatric Wars. It was followed by: Fringeworthy, the first interdimensional travel RPG; Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic, a late 20th Century Horror RPG; and FTL:2448, a space RPG. All three were created by Tucholka. The company name was changed to \\"Tri Tac Games\\" to reflect what the company saw as the more serious nature of its new products. Currently the company sells a number of games and books, including a book of cartoons and a cookbook called Damn Strange Recipe Collection. It has reincorporated as Tri Tac Games, LLC, and its owner is Richard Tucholka's widow, Melody Natcher. In 1994 the Tri Tac offices were raided by the FBI, because of alleged similarities between promotional ID badges distributed by Tri Tac personnel and certain official U.S. government ID badges. After the raid, the federal prosecutor assigned to the case elected not to press charges. A year later the FBI visited the Tri Tac booth at Gen Con 95 to see if Tri Tac was distributing similar ID badges. Tri Tac was no longer selling the badges but they did display one of the controversial badges. It was sealed in a frame with a newspaper report about the raid. The FBI determined Tri Tac presented no threat to national security and left without comment. After Tucholka's passing in 2017, his wife, Melody Natcher, took over as the owner of Tri Tac Games and has released several of the games, some with complete make overs such as Hard Wired Hinterland, and others just spelling and grammar corrections.

In later years, Morrow left the world of politics to become a book publisher. He is best remembered as a factional leader of the American Trotskyist movement. Early life Felix Morrow was born Felix Mayrowitz to an Orthodox Jewish family in 1906 in New York City. His parents, emigrants from Eastern Europe, ran a small grocery store in the city. Morrow later recalled his upbringing in a letter to historian Alan Wald: > I came from a Hassidic family, but my father at the age of 15 had fled in > disillusionment from the house of the Chortkow Rebbe where his father was a > gabbai (rabbai's assistant). But my mother remained religious and I had a > traditional Jewish education.Alan M. Wald, \\"The Menorah Group Moves Left,\\" > Jewish Social Studies, vol. 38, no. 3/4. (Summer/Fall 1976). pgs. 289-320 In the U.S., both of Felix Mayrowitz's parents had become socialists and Felix had been a participant in the youth section of the Socialist Party of America from an early age, beginning with the Junior division of the Young People's Socialist League. At age 16, Felix was employed as a reporter by the Brooklyn Daily Times. He later went to work for the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, using his paychecks there to help finance his education at New York University (NYU). Felix Mayrowitz graduated from NYU in 1928 and enrolled in graduate school at Columbia University, also located in New York City, where he studied religion in association with the Philosophy Department. At the time of his enrolling at Columbia, Felix availed himself of advice he had received that his professional progress would be easier with a less ethnic surname; it was at this time that Felix Mayrowitz became Felix Morrow. Friends at Columbia included Herbert Solow, Meyer Schapiro, Whittaker Chambers, George Novack, John McDonald, and Sidney Hook. Career=CommunismCPUSA= In 1931, the young graduate student applied for membership in the Communist Party USA in the wake of his friend Solow. At the time of his application, Morrow was advised by New York District Organizer Israel Amter that he would be of greater service to the party as a \\"secret\\" member of the organization rather than as a known public figure. Morrow was told by Amter to consider himself a party member, and his application was squirreled away in Amter's desk. Morrow traveled the country extensively as a reporter for the Communist Party literary-artistic monthly, The New Masses and for its daily newspaper, The Daily Worker, making use of the pseudonym \\"George Cooper.\\" His journalism was later collected into book form and translated into Russian for publication in the Soviet Union in 1933 as Life in the United States in this Depression. He also taught courses on American history at the CPUSA's New York party training school, served as a member of the party's speakers' bureau, and assisted Joseph Freeman with editorial tasks at The New Masses. =CLA= Morrow was for many years a leading figure in American Trotskyism, best known for his book Revolution and Counter-Revolution In Spain. He joined the Communist League of America in 1933. During this period, he described Malcolm Cowley as \\"the literary cop who patrols The New Republic beat for Stalin.\\" =SWP, WP= After Max Shachtman's minority split in 1940, served as editor of 'Fourth International' monthly theory/polemical journal of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) between 1940‚Äì45, until displaced by E R Frank (Bert Cochran) on the maneuvers of James P Cannon and the SWP majority who opposed his views on perspectives for European Trotskyists at the mid-war point. He was one of 18 SWP leaders, including the party's National Secretary, James P. Cannon, imprisoned under the Smith Act during the Second World War. In 1943 he formed a faction, with Albert Goldman which challenged the SWP's \\"orthodox\\" catastrophic perspective. Morrow and Goldman projected the likelihood of a prolonged period of bourgeois democracy in western Europe and emphasised the need for democratic and transitional demands against the maximalism advocated by the majority. Although he was expelled from the SWP in 1946 for \\"unauthorised collaboration\\" with Shachtman's Workers Party, he did not join Shachtman, and drifted from left-wing politics to the right. Publishing In the early 1950s, with the help of friends Meyer Schapiro and Elliot Cohen, Morrow was hired by Schocken Books, working first as salesman and soon as a vice president there. He later worked at Beacon Press, a publisher based in Boston, Massachusetts. In the late 1950s Morrow founded University Books, publishing hundreds of titles under that imprint, including a number of reprints. By June 23, 1958, Morrow had obtained a US security clearance and had contracted with the CIA to prepare a Russian manuscript of Doctor Zhivago for distribution to Soviet visitors to the Brussels International World Fair, and also to give copies to sailors on ships bound for the Soviet Union.Scammell, Michael, The CIA‚Äôs Zhivago, New York Review of Books, July 10, 2014 issue. retrieved June 30, 2014 Morrow wrote the foreword to the book Aleister Crowley: The Man, The Poet, The Mage by C.

Copyright Office). In the 1970s University Books was sold to the publisher Lyle Stuart, who continued to publish books under the imprint along with his own. Death Morrow died on May 28, 1988. He was survived by two daughters, a son, and two grandchildren. He lost another son to a car accident in 1969.

They consisted of Steve Nieve (keyboards and ukulele), Bruce Thomas (bass guitar), and Pete Thomas (drums). They also released one album (and two associated singles) as an independent entity, without Costello, in 1980. History Backing for Costello's 1977 debut album was provided by the American West Coast band Clover. Later in 1977, Costello formed his own permanent backing band, the Attractions, consisting of Steve Nieve (born Steve Nason; keyboards and ukulele) from London, Bruce Thomas (bass guitar) from Stockton-on-Tees, and Pete Thomas (drums) from Sheffield. The two Thomases are unrelated. Bruce Thomas was the oldest group member (29 when he joined), with the most professional experience prior to being an Attraction. He had previously been a member of the band Quiver, who had released two albums on their own in 1971/72, as well as functioning as the backing band for several albums by The Sutherland Brothers. These albums were rather awkwardly credited to \\"The Sutherland Brothers and Quiver\\"; Thomas played on the early recordings credited to this group, including the minor American hit \\"(I Don't Want to Love You But) You Got Me Anyway\\", which peaked at No. 48 in 1973. He left the group before their biggest success, 1976's \\"Arms of Mary\\", a No. 5 UK hit and a No. 1 hit in many European countries. Thomas was also a member of Moonrider for their lone album in 1975, and recorded as a session musician for Al Stewart in the early to mid-seventies. Pete Thomas, who was born the same month as Costello, had recorded one album as a member of Chilli Willi and the Red Hot Peppers. Only Nason, who had classical training, had never recorded or played with a rock band before. Just 19 when he joined the group, Nason gained the stage name \\"Steve Nieve\\" (pronounced as \\"naive\\") from Ian Dury; while Elvis Costello & The Attractions were playing a series of concerts with Dury before they recorded their first single, Nason innocently asked Dury \\"What's a groupie?\\" Dury immediately dubbed Nason \\"Steve Naive\\", and the name stuck (although the spelling was altered.) Elvis Costello and the Attractions played live gigs as early as the summer of 1977, and a few live tracks were appended to the B-side of the Costello solo single \\"Watching The Detectives\\", issued in October 1977. The full band made their studio recording debut with the March 1978 single \\"(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea\\". From there, the Attractions backed Costello on all of his albums and singles until 1984, with the exception of \\"New Amsterdam\\" (1980), a solo single recorded by Costello. In 1980, The Attractions recorded an album of their own, entitled Mad About The Wrong Boy. The album featured original compositions by all three group members, and was produced by Roger Bechirian. Steve Nieve wrote the music for several songs under the pseudonym \\"Norman Brain\\"; for these songs, his then- girlfriend Fay Hart provided lyrics, leading to a writing credit of \\"Brain/Hart\\". The Brain/Hart composition \\"Single Girl\\" was released as the first single from the album, followed by the Nieve-composed \\"Arms Race\\" as the second single. Neither single charted. Due to their frequent use of pseudonyms and their associations with Bechirian, The Attractions were widely - but erroneously - rumoured to have been behind Blanket of Secrecy (BoS), a synthpop trio recognised at the time only by the pseudonyms 'Tinker', 'Tailor' and 'Soldier'. The group's lone album, Walls Have Ears, was produced by Bechirian and issued in 1982. Guitarist Martin Belmont was briefly added to Attractions live line-up in 1981, but never recorded as an official member of the band. He did, however, make a guest appearance on the 1981 Elvis Costello and The Attractions single \\"From A Whisper to a Scream\\", which was also included on the album, Trust. Albums by Elvis Costello and The Attractions appeared regularly until 1984. On that year's Goodbye Cruel World and its associated tour, The Attractions' keyboardist was billed as \\"Maurice Worm\\"; yet another pseudonym for Nason/Nieve. In early 1986, Costello released King of America, billed to The Costello Show and made largely without the Attractions. The Attractions played on only one track, as well as the non-LP B-side \\"Baby's Got A Brand New Hairdo\\", billed to 'The Costello Show Featuring The Attractions'. Later that same year Costello reunited with The Attractions to record the album Blood & Chocolate, but this would prove to be the final Attractions release for several years. Growing antipathy between Costello and Bruce Thomas contributed to the Attractions' first split in 1986, and the rift was exacerbated by what Costello felt was his unflattering portrayal in Thomas' 1990 book The Big Wheel. Despite this, the original group reunited for several tracks on Costello's 1994 album Brutal Youth and toured together over the next two years. They recorded one further album as a group (1996's All This Useless Beauty) but split for good in 1996. Nieve and Pete Thomas continued to back Costello through various touring and recording lineups, and are still members of his current backing group The Imposters. The split between Costello and Bruce Thomas, however, appears permanent. Bruce Thomas made a brief appearance with his former bandmates when the group was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2003, but when Costello was asked why Thomas did not play with them at the event, he reportedly replied, \\"I only work with professional musicians.\\" Discography For releases by Elvis Costello & The Attractions, please see the Elvis Costello discography.

The term derives from the Middle English bellewether and refers to the practice of placing a bell around the neck of a castrated ram (a wether) leading the flock of sheep. A shepherd could then note the movements of the flock by hearing the bell, even when the flock was not in sight. In sociology, the term is applied in the active sense to a person or group of people who tend to create, influence, or set trends. In politics, the term more often applies in a metaphorical sense to describe a geographic region where political tendencies match in microcosm those of a wider area, such that the result of an election in the former region might predict the eventual result in the latter. In a Westminster-style election, for example, a constituency, the control of which tends frequently to change, can mirror in its popular vote the result on a national scale. In the stock market, a bellwether is a stock taken to be a leading indicator of the direction in a sector, an industry or the market as a whole. Bellwether stocks therefore serve as short term guides. JPMorgan Chase is an example of a bellwether stock. As one of the major banks in the United States, it sets the tone for the rest of the industry. JPMorgan Chase also has contracts with companies in other industries, so its performance is reflected in other sectors of the market. Tata Consultancy Services is similarly a bellwether for technology stocks in the Indian markets, BSE and NSE.  Politics =Australia In Australian federal elections, the Division of Robertson in New South Wales became the nation's new longest-running bellwether seat, continuously won by the party that also won government since the 1983 federal election. Previously, the electoral division of Eden-Monaro elected its Member of Parliament from the party which won government at every federal election from 1972 until 2016, when the record was broken after Labor won the seat, while the Coalition won government. The Division of Lindsay in NSW, has elected its Member of Parliament from the party which won government in every Federal election since its creation in 1984 until 2016. Both Lindsay and Eden-Monaro lost their bellwether status at the 2016 federal election, both electing Labor MPs, despite a narrow Coalition win nationwide. The Division of Makin in South Australia was a bellwether division from 1984-2010, although ceased its bellwether record in 2013, when Makin stayed Labor as the Coalition regained power nationwide. Also, in terms of nationwide two party preferred vote, Eden- Monaro, Lindsay, Robertson and Makin have bucked the bellwether trend in the past by voting Liberal at the 1998 federal election. In purely statistical terms, the state of New South Wales, which has the largest population of any Australian state or territory, could also be considered a \\"bellwether\\", as, until the 2016 federal election the party which wins government has won the majority of House of Representatives seats in that state at every election since 1963. Unlike many bellwethers, these are cited by analysts solely for their record and are not usually attributed to demographic factors that reflect the median of Australia. Brazil In Brazilian direct presidential elections, the state of Minas Gerais is where the winning candidate took the lead in the last-round election from 1955 to 2018. Canada In the Canadian province of Ontario, Sarnia-Lambton (and its predecessor ridings) voted for the winning party in every federal election from 1963 until 2011. This streak was broken in 2015. St. Paul's has only elected three opposition MPs since it was created in 1935. Also in Ontario, Peterborough has been won by the party who has won the most seats overall in provincial elections since 1977. In Alberta, Peace River has elected only three opposition MLAs since the province was founded in 1905. France Map of bellwethers in France Since the establishment of the French Fifth Republic, the president was elected by popular vote in 1965 up to 2017, five departments have always voted the chosen candidate in the second round: Ard√®che, Calvados, Charente-Maritime, Indre-et- Loire and Loire. No region has done so in the first round. Germany Since the creation of the Federal Republic of Germany (then West Germany) in 1949, the state where the leading party list vote (Zweitstimmen) matched the party of the subsequently chosen Chancellor more times is Schleswig-Holstein (with two misses: 1969 and 2005), followed by the state of Lower Saxony (with misses in 1949, 1969 and 2005). Both states lie in the North of the country, neither containing many large industrial cities (the biggest being Kiel and Hannover respectively), nor large rural Catholic populations, the traditional base of SPD and CDU/CSU respectively. Schleswig-Holstein is also famous for having had several state elections result in a one-seat majority for the winning coalition and Lower Saxony's 1998 election (in which Gerhard Schr√∂der was the SPD candidate) is often seen as a \\"trial run\\" for the subsequent federal election (which Schr√∂der also won). Both the 1949 and the 1969 elections were rather narrow, the former resulting in a one-vote majority in the election for chancellor and the latter resulting in a 12-seat majority that had broken down due to defections by 1972. India Two individual seats, Valsad and West Delhi have successfully voted for the victorious party at the last eleven general elections. Furthermore, the party which wins the majority of seats in Delhi has always gone on to form the national government since 1998. The state of Uttar Pradesh is also seen as a bellwether, with the national government having been formed the majority of times by the party that won the most seats in the state. Ireland Ireland has a proportional representation electoral system, in which politicians are elected by the single transferable vote. Bellwethers here can only be measured by the number of candidates from each side elected to Ireland's multiple-seat constituencies that elect an odd number of members. Between the 1981 general election and 2011 general election, Meath and its successors, Meath East and Meath West, have elected a majority of Fianna F√°il TDs in years when Fianna F√°il formed the government, and a majority of Fine Gael and Labour TDs when those parties formed the government. New Zealand In New Zealand, there are three generally accepted bellwether electorates: Hamilton East and Hamilton West, both based around the city of Hamilton, and Northcote on Auckland's North Shore. Hamilton West and Northcote missed one election each since they were first contested in 1969 and 1996 respectively ‚Äî the for Hamilton West and the for Northcote. Hamilton East, first contested in 1972, has missed three elections ‚Äî 1993, 1999, and 2005. They were all held by the National Party in the 2017 election although Labour formed the government after the election. Since the National Party was still returned as the largest party in Parliament, however, the two electorates did in fact retain their bellwether status, albeit to a limited extent. Philippines In the Philippines, the winner of Philippine presidential election has won in Negros Oriental in all instances since 1935 except for 1961 and 2016, and in Basilan since its creation in December 1973. After Negros Oriental voted for the runner-up in 2016, Basilan's streak that started in 1978 is currently the nation's longest. For vice presidential elections, Pangasinan has voted for the winner in all elections save for 1986 and 2016. Portugal In every general election to the National Assembly since the restoration of democracy in 1975, the electoral district of Braga has voted for the party or coalition that has won the most seats in the election. (Note that following the elections of 2015, a minority government was eventually formed by the second-largest party in the Assembly.) South Korea Since the 1987 presidential election, the central province of North Chungcheong was the one in which the most voted candidate for the presidency was the national winner. Spain Since democracy was restored in 1977, up to 2019- two provinces have always voted for the winning party (Zaragoza and Huesca). The Autonomous Community of Aragon, where said provinces are located. Aragon is, moreover, the sole Autonomous Community to have done so. Sweden The expression \\"Som Ljungby r√∂star r√∂star Sverige\\" (\\"As Ljungby votes, Sweden votes\\") was coined in the early-1970s, but more recently (2006) voting results in Karlstad, Kalmar and Halmstad more closely resembled the result of the whole nation in elections to the Riksdag.\\"Som Karlstad r√∂star, r√∂star Sverige \\", Statistiska Centralbyr√•n, 6 March 2006. Retrieved 27 March 2017. According to Statistics Sweden, election results in Karlstad have been closest to the national results for three consecutive elections, a fact often highlighted by media through Gallup Polls showing voting intentions in the area. Taiwan From the first competitive multi-party elections in 1996 on, the Changhua County was the region of Taiwan where the leading presidential candidate became the elected president of the country. United Kingdom United Kingdom constituencies have been subject to frequent review since the late-1960s, particularly those of the House of Commons. Few constituencies are unchanged from one review to another. Therefore, true bellwethers are rare. However, it is possible to match new constituencies to old ones according to the destination of the bulk of the old electorate. Long running bellwether constituencies * The Dartford constituency has reflected the overall result at every general election since 1964. * The Loughborough, Northampton North and Watford constituencies have reflected every result since the February 1974 general election. * The Worcester constituency has reflected the overall result in every general election since 1979. * The Stourbridge constituency, and its predecessor, Halesowen and Stourbridge, has reflected the overall result in every general election since 1979. * The Reading West, Amber Valley, Norwich North and Corby constituencies have reflected every result since 1983 * The Nuneaton constituency has been seen as an important national bellwether since 1997. Former bellwether constituencies * The Gravesham constituency (and its predecessor Gravesend) has reflected the overall result from 1955, with the only exception being 2005. * The Luton South constituency (and its predecessors Luton East and Luton) had reflected the overall result from 1951 until 2010. *The Brentford and Isleworth constituency had reflected the overall result from 1979 until 2015. * The Bristol North West constituency had reflected every result since the October 1974 election until 2017. * The Lincoln constituency has reflected the overall result from the October 1974 election, with the only exception being 2017. * The Bury North constituency has reflected the overall result from 1983, with the only exception being 2017. * The Battersea constituency had reflected every result from 1987 until 2017. * The Basildon constituency reflected every result from its creation in 1974 to its abolition in 2010. * The Southampton Test constituency reflected every result from 1966-2010. =Scottish Parliament= The constituencies of Cunninghame North, Stirling and Na h-Eileanan an Iar have all elected MSPs from the party which won the plurality of seats in the election overall for every Scottish Parliament election. Also, the constituencies of Almond Valley, Dundee City West, Edinburgh Eastern, Glasgow Southside, Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley and Mid Fife and Glenrothes each elected an MSP from the largest party in the 2011 and 2016 elections. This continues the trend that their predecessor constituencies (Livingston, Dundee West, Edinburgh East & Musselburgh, Glasgow Govan, Kilmarnock & Loudoun and Fife Central) achieved in the 1999, 2003 and 2007 elections. = Senedd Cymru = The following constituencies (as of the 2016 election) have elected MSs from the party which won the plurality of seats in the election overall for every Senedd (and former Assembly) election since 1999: * Aberavon * Alyn and Deeside * Bridgend * Caerphilly * Cardiff South and Penarth * Cardiff West * Clwyd South * Cynon Valley * Delyn * Gower * Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney * Neath * Newport East * Newport West * Ogmore * Pontypridd * Swansea East * Swansea West * Torfaen * Vale of Clwyd * Vale of Glamorgan Note that as Labour has won the most seats in every election since the Welsh Assembly was founded in 1999, this is a list of seats which have always voted Labour. United StatesStates= The American bellwether states can be determined in different ways (with respect to presidential elections): Highest percentage for varying lengths of time * Ohio ‚Äì 2 misses (1944, 1960) from 1896 on (93.5%, slightly \\"too Republican\\"), perfect since 1964. Currently the longest perfect streak. * Florida ‚Äì 2 misses (1960, 1992) from 1928 on (91.3%, slightly \\"too Republican\\"). * Nevada ‚Äì 3 misses (1908, 1976, 2016) from 1904 on (89.7%, slightly \\"too Democratic\\"). * Missouri ‚Äì 3 misses (1956, 2008, 2012) from 1904 on (89.7%, slightly \\"too Republican\\"). Was often referred to as the \\"Missouri bellwether\\". Donald Trump won Missouri in 2016 by almost 19 points, which suggests it will likely be less of a bellwether state in future elections. * New Mexico ‚Äì 3 misses (1976, 2000, 2016) from 1912 on (88.9%, slightly \\"too Democratic\\"). Currently the longest streak of tracking with the national popular vote. * Tennessee ‚Äì 3 misses (1960, 2008, 2012) from 1928 on (87.0%, slightly \\"too Republican\\"). The state has now gone Republican in thirteen of the last 17 elections. Highest percentage for a set length of time Electoral record of the states for presidential elections, 1896‚Äì2016: * Ohio ‚Äì 29 wins out of 31 elections (93.5%) * New Mexico ‚Äì 24 wins out of 27 elections (88.8%) * Illinois ‚Äì 26 wins out of 31 elections (83.8%) * Nevada ‚Äì 26 wins out of 31 elections (83.8%) Smallest deviation from the national average Another way to measure how much a state's results reflect the national average is how far the state deviates from the national results. The states with the least deviation from a two-party presidential vote from 1896 to 2012 include: * Ohio ‚Äì 2.2% * New Mexico ‚Äì 2.8% * Illinois ‚Äì 3.6% * Missouri ‚Äì 3.7% * Delaware ‚Äì 3.7% States that were considered bellwether states from the mid-to- late 20th century until the early 21st century include: * Delaware ‚Äì Perfect from 1952 to 1996, the only state with this distinction. As a result of massive growth and a move to the Democrats in New Castle County, Delaware (suburban Philadelphia, with the old industrial city of Wilmington), the state has become reliably Democratic. New Castle County had previously voted for the winning candidate in every election from 1936 to 1996. * Arizona ‚Äì Perfect from 1912 to 1956. * Illinois ‚Äì 3 misses (1884, 1916, 1976) from 1852 to 1996, the most reliable in this period. As the Chicago metropolitan area shifted to become overwhelmingly Democratic, the state lost its bellwether status. No Republican had ever won the White House without taking Illinois prior to 2000. * California ‚Äì 3 misses (1912, 1960, 1976) from 1888 to 1996. * Wyoming ‚Äì 3 misses (1944, 1960, 1976) from 1900 to 1988. * Utah ‚Äì 3 misses (1912, 1960, 1976) from 1900 to 1988. * Montana ‚Äì 3 misses (1960, 1976, 1996) from 1904 to 2004. * Oklahoma ‚Äì 3 misses (1924, 1960, 1976) from 1912 to 1988. * New Hampshire ‚Äì 3 misses (1948, 1960, 1976) from 1936 to 2000. * Iowa - 3 Misses (1976, 1988, 2000) since 1964 * Colorado ‚Äì 3 misses (1960, 1976, 1996) from 1948 to 2012. * Idaho ‚Äì 2 misses (1960, 1976) from 1904 to 1988. * New Jersey ‚Äì 2 misses (1948, 1976) from 1920 to 1996. * Virginia ‚Äì 2 misses (1960, 1976) from 1928 to 1988. Was traditionally Republican at the time. Otherwise, the state was traditionally Democratic. Although the 2012 election wasn't included in this bellwether run, Virginia was actually the closest state to the national vote in 2012. Donald Trump, however, managed to win in the next election without Virginia. * Kentucky ‚Äì 2 misses (1952, 1960) from 1924 to 2004. * Missouri was often referred to as the Missouri bellwether as it produced the same outcome as the national results in the presidential election 96.2% of the time for the century between 1904 and 2004, only missing in 1956. It did not match the national result in 2008 or 2012, and is considered to have lost its bellwether status. * Washington ‚Äì 1 miss from 1900 to 1956 (in 1912). * Texas ‚Äì 1 miss from 1928 to 1988 (in 1968). * Minnesota ‚Äì 1 miss from 1920 to 1976 (in 1968). * Arkansas ‚Äì 1 miss from 1960 to 2004 (in 1968). * North Dakota ‚Äì Perfect from 1896 to 1936. * Kansas ‚Äì Perfect from 1900 to 1936. States that were bellwether states a very long time ago include: * Pennsylvania ‚Äì One miss from 1800 to 1880 (in 1824). * Indiana ‚Äì One miss from 1852 to 1912 (in 1876). * Wisconsin ‚Äì One miss from 1860 to 1912 (in 1884). * New York ‚Äì One miss from 1880 to 1944 (in 1916). It previously had a perfect streak from 1816 to 1852. Had the most electoral votes during the entire period. In addition, the Territory of Guam has had no misses from 1984 to 2012 (100.0%). Guam has no electoral college votes, but conducts a presidential straw vote on local election day. Also of note, from 1996 through 2012, Ohio was within 1.85% of the national popular vote result. Due to the Electoral College system, a bellwether of sufficient size is often also a focus of national attention and presidential campaigns as a so-called swing state that can decide the election one way or the other. As of 2016, Ohio and Florida are seen as the most important swing states and no Republican has won the presidency while losing Ohio and the controversial decision in Bush v. Gore ultimately hinged on a recount of Florida, that ‚Äì had it gone for Gore ‚Äì would have swung the Electoral College vote. =Counties= American bellwether counties include: * Valencia County, New Mexico ‚Äì perfect since 1952 (longest current perfect streak) * Vigo County, Indiana (county seat: Terre Haute) ‚Äì 2 misses (1908, 1952) from 1888 on, perfect since 1956. From 1960 to 2004, Vigo County had been within 3 percent points of the national presidential vote every election. In 2008, Vigo County again voted with the winner, but Obama's percentage of 57.3% was about 4.4% above Obama's national vote. In 2012, Vigo kept its streak going, voting for President Obama, 49.5% to Romney's 48.6%. Vigo County continued the trend in 2016, with election winner Donald Trump winning the county 55.1% to Hillary Clinton's 40%; as in 2008, the final percentages were more than 3 percent different from the national popular vote, which Clinton won 48.2% to Trump's 46.1% (The President of the United States is not elected directly by popular vote, but indirectly by the Electoral College). Vigo County is particularly important because it is in Indiana which declares early in the evening, meaning it can be one of the first signs of a winner. * Westmoreland County, Virginia (county seat: Montross) ‚Äì two misses since 1928 (in 1948 and 1960), perfect since 1964. * Ottawa County, Ohio (county seat: Port Clinton) ‚Äì one miss since 1948 (in 1960), perfect since 1964. * Wood County, Ohio (county seat: Bowling Green) ‚Äì one miss since 1964 (in 1976), perfect since 1980. * Kent County, Delaware ‚Äì two misses since 1928 (in 1948 and in 1992). * Co√∂s County, New Hampshire (county seat: Lancaster) ‚Äì two misses since 1892 (in 1968 and 2004) * Essex County, Vermont ‚Äì one miss since 1964 (in 1976), perfect since 1980. * Sawyer County, Wisconsin ‚Äì one miss since 1952 (in 1960), perfect since 1964. * Sargent County, North Dakota (county seat: Forman) ‚Äì one miss since 1948 (in 1988)The Political Graveyard; Sargent County, North Dakota * Blaine County, Montana (county seat: Chinook) ‚Äì one miss since 1916 (in 1988)1892 ‚ÄòPresidential Election of 1892‚Äô (and subsequent elections‚Äô maps) * Clallam County, Washington ‚Äì two misses (1968, 1976) since 1920. * Stanislaus County, California (county seat Modesto) ‚Äì one miss since 1972 (in 2016). * Ventura County, California ‚Äì two misses since 1920 (in 1976 and 2016). * Merced County, California (county seat Merced) ‚Äì one miss since 1972 (in 2016). * Hidalgo County, New Mexico (county seat: Lordsburg) ‚Äì one miss since 1928 (in 1968), perfect since 1972. * Bexar County, Texas (county seat: San Antonio) ‚Äì two misses since 1932 (in 1968 and 2016).Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections See individual state presidential results county maps.

Donelson was also the father-in-law of future United States president, Andrew Jackson, who married his daughter, Rachel. Career Donelson served in the Virginia House of Burgesses before moving to the Watauga settlements on the Holston and Watauga Rivers in Washington District, North Carolina. From about 1770 to 1779, he operated the Washington Iron Furnace at Rocky Mount, Franklin County, Virginia. Along with James Robertson, he co-founded Fort Nashborough, in 1780, which would eventually become Nashville, Tennessee. A collection of his diaries are kept in Cleveland Hall, in Nashville. Personal life Donelson married Rachel [n√©e Stockley] Donelson (1730‚Äì1801) in 1744. Their daughter, Rachel Jackson, married the seventh President of the United States, Andrew Jackson.

Best known for producing records for Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age, he is regarded as an important figure in the development of stoner rock and desert rock genres. Goss is also the lead singer and guitarist of the hard rock band Masters of Reality. Recording career As well as being the founding (and only constant) member of influential desert rock outfit Masters of Reality, Goss is also well known for his production work on albums by Kyuss and Queens of the Stone Age. Largely credited as the Godfather of desert rock, Goss has on several occasions played down the importance of his role in this musical movement. In 1999 he stated, ‚ÄúI can't make any claim at all to inventing desert rock, or stoner rock, or whatever you want to call it. I make rock n roll records, and hopefully try to make the listener feel like I did when I heard my favourite music.‚Äù In 2004, Goss highlighted exactly what kind of music he created, ‚ÄúThere's a bunch of weirdos that I work with all the time, and we make what I call \\"out of whack\\" Rock records. That's what I do. When people want an \\"out of whack\\" weird Rock record, they call me, and I take an \\"out of whack\\" amount of money to do it, and I'm glad to be there. It's cool.‚Äù In late 2004, Chris Goss had to be hospitalized due to severe internal infection and the European leg of his tour in support of the new Masters of Reality album Give Us Barabbas had to be postponed indefinitely. After his recuperation, he joined Jeordie White and Zach Hill to release I Got a Brand New Egg Layin' Machine, a \\"mini LP\\" released under the name Goon Moon. Goss appeared with his longtime friend Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age as \\"The 5:15ers\\" at the \\"winter edition\\" of ArthurFest, performing an intimate set which was \\"crafted in less than a month as the duo was a rather late addition to the Arthurball line-up as Sunday's headliner\\".Icecreamman.com article Continuing with Goon Moon, Goss, White and Hill released a full- length album in May 2007 entitled Licker's Last Leg containing many guest artists synonymous with the desert rock scene. Goss also joined Queens of the Stone Age and Billy Gibbons to perform \\"Burn the Witch\\" on Late Night with Conan O'Brien. In 2013, regarding Josh Homme's supposed decision to sequence the album Era Vulgaris using songs originated in a \\"Los Angeles studio [beginning recording] without a single thing written, just to see what it was like to force songs out of his [and his bandmate's] psyche\\", Goss was quoted saying: \\"I‚Äôve seen him do that before with the Desert Sessions but never with Queens. The Queens Of The Stone Age is a business, where he‚Äôs the CEO. It‚Äôs not run the same.\\" In 2014, filming completed in Las Vegas for Death in the Desert, a full-length movie for which Goss wrote an original song titled \\"Only the Lonely\\", performed by singer Roxy Saint, who plays the character Corey in the full-length film, which is directed and produced by Saint's husband, Josh Evans. It stars Michael Madsen, Shayla Beesley and Paz de la Huerta. The movie is inspired by the book Death in the Desert by Cathy Scott, with the screenplay by John Steppling.

Early life He was born in Verri√®res-le-Buisson (now in the Essonne department). Educated in a conservative Catholic family, he was a remote cousin of writers Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry and Louise de Vilmorin, later companion of Andr√© Malraux. Estienne d'Orves spent the First World War as a high school student at the prestigious Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand and the Lyc√©e Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague in Paris, and entered the √âcole Polytechnique in 1921. He joined the √âcole Navale, (French Naval Academy), two years later, becoming an enseigne de vaisseau de 2e classe in October 1923 and joining the school ship Jeanne d'Arc. He was then an officer on the battleship Provence, and several other vessels. In 1929, he married √âliane de Lorgeril, with whom he had five children. In 1930, he was promoted to lieutenant de vaisseau, and was made a chevalier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1935. In December 1936, he joined the Naval War School for one year. When World War II broke out in 1939, he was serving aboard the Jaguar, as under-chief of the headquarters of the 2nd flotilla of torpedo boats in Mediterranean Sea. In December 1939, he was an aide to Admiral Godfroy in the Headquarters of the \\"Force X\\" aboard cruiser Duquesne On 25 June 1940, the day the Armistice was signed, he was in Alexandria, Egypt. Politically, d'Estienne d'Orves belonged to the right-wing, and had sympathies for Charles Maurras and Catholic monarchism; nonetheless, while many far-right wing theoricists welcomed the arrival of Marshal Philippe P√©tain, the strongly patriotic d'Estienne d'Orves was unwilling to accept France's defeat. He attempted to join General Paul Legentilhomme, commander of French troops on the coast of French Somaliland, who had announced his intention to refuse the armistice, but the colony had chosen to rally itself to the Vichy r√©gime. D'Estienne d'Orves then gathered a group of volunteer sailors and officers, took the nom de guerre \\"Ch√¢teauvieux\\" (name of one of his ancestors) and came into relations with the Free France authorities. He set sail on a cargo ship from Aden to London, sailing around Africa for two months, and rejoined General de Gaulle in London on 27 September 1940. He met with Admiral √âmile Muselier, but was unable to obtain a command at sea. Promoted to Capitaine de corvette (lieutenant commander) on 1 October 1940, he joined the Second Office of the Free French Naval Forces and requested to be sent to occupied France. After having convinced General de Gaulle, he received the mission to organise an intelligence network in western France, codenamed Nemrod, which had been created in September 1940 by Maurice Barlier and Jan Doornik, but lacked coordination and development. He was officially assigned to this task on 15 December 1940. Role in Occupied France D'Estienne d'Orves was codenamed \\"Jean-Pierre Girard\\". On 21 December 1940, he set sail from Newlyn to Plogoff in Brittany on a fishing boat, the Marie-Louise, along with his 20-year-old radio operator Alfred Gaessler, a German-speaking Alsatian, codenamed Georges Marty. They arrived at the Pointe du Raz the following day. He set his quarters in Chantenay-sur-Loire, near Nantes, at the house of M. and Mme Cl√©ment, and made several trips to Paris and in Brittany, with the notable assistance of Maurice Barlier. He set up the basic organisation of the spying web, and was able to transmit significant information about German forces (coastal defences, submarines, aerodromes and refueling point near Nantes). From 6 January to 19 January 1941, he was in Paris to set up a second network, meeting with Max Andr√©, Jan Doornik and numerous other members of the French Resistance. Back in Nantes on 20 January, he came back to the Cl√©ments who reported to him suspicious activities by the radio operator Gaessler, seen hanging around in bars and talking with German soldiers. When interrogated, Gaessler said that this was a good way to gather information. D'Estienne d'Orves decided to lay down Marty at the next trip to London but, two days later, the Gestapo stormed the house and arrested him. After a brief resistance, a wounded and handcuffed d'Estienne d'Orves was brought to Angers, along with his companions. Marty's treason allowed the Nazis to also arrest Barlier, Doornik and most of the network, totaling 26 persons. The small intelligence network created by Max Andr√©, however, was untouched, and continued its operations until the Liberation of Paris in August 1944. For several weeks, Gaessler sent false information to London and allowed the Nazis to arrest several other agents. He was evacuated by the Nazis to Austria, and disappeared in 1945. Trial and death Proclamation of the execution of d'Estienne d'Orves and his companions, - Maurice Barlier and Jan Doornik by the occupier On 24 January, the prisoners were sent to Berlin, then brought back to Paris, to the Cherche-Midi Prison. D'Estienne d'Orves was put under a particularly harsh treatment, yet managed to cheer up his fellow prisoners; the moral strength which he would find in his faith would later be testified to by German chaplain Franz Stock. His trial began on 13 May. D'Estienne d'Orves claimed full responsibility of the network, defending his fellow prisoners. On the 23rd, a German court martial sentenced him to death, along with eight of his companions, and transferred them to the Fresnes Prison. Acknowledging their patriotism, the court martial filed a request for grace immediately, and German legal advisor Keyser took it upon himself to make the trip to Berlin and request a grace for the prisoners from Hitler himself. However, the invasion of USSR by the Third Reich, on 22 June 1941, forced the French Communists to join the Resistance and greatly increased the attacks against German forces, inducing a harshening of the repression. Hence, on 28 August, the execution order was given for d'Estienne d'Orves, Barlier and Doornik. The three condemned were granted to spend their last night together, and to be shot standing and without a blindfold. They were blessed by Chaplain Franz Stock. D'Estienne d'Orves had an interview with president Keyser, the German military judge who had sentenced him to death, where he said: \\"Sir, you are a German officer. I am a French officer. We both did our duty. Please allow me to embrace you\\". The execution took place on 29 August 1941 at dawn at the Fort du Mont Val√©rien. Honor√© d'Estienne d'Orves was buried in Verri√®res-le-Buisson. A German poster advertised their deaths. A number of people joined the Resistance as a consequence of this execution. The Capitaine de corvette d'Estienne d'Orves was later posthumously promoted to Capitaine de fr√©gate (Commander) and made a Compagnon de la Lib√©ration (\\"Fellow of the Liberation\\").

It became a mining town after discovery of gold in the area in September 1886. The area was difficult to mine and produced small quantities of gold, and the population dropped off by the turn of the century. The land was acquired by the United States Forest Service and by 1933, the remaining structures were dismantled because they were considered a fire hazard, but a cemetery remains. History The town was founded as a gold mining camp, after a \\"rich strike\\" was discovered west of Fort Collins in September 1886 between the Seven Mile and Elk Horn creeks. This resulted in a rush of miners to the area along Manhattan Creek. The town was platted in 1887 and a post office opened in March of that year. Today only a few boards remain of the town that had the Ace of Cubs saloon, a hotel, a butcher, livery stable, blacksmith, and houses. At first, people lived in tents and by the end of October 1887 there were 100 miners in town and 125 claims had been made. A school was opened the previous month that served Manhattan, Rustic, Elk Horn and Seven-Mile. There was little gold found and it was expensive to get to deposits deep into the earth. There were about 50 people in Manhattan in 1888. A discovery in the fall of 1890 led to a boom and building construction. Two people died in a mine explosion at the Black Hawk mine on November 13, 1892. There were about 300 people in Manhattan in 1898, but that had dropped to 50 in 1899. The post office closed at the end of 1900. In 1904, the school closed. A school was established in Elk Horn that in 1970 became part of the Fort Collins schools. There were about 300 men who mined the Laugh-a-lot, Little Tipsy, and Katy's Pet mines, but the town never realized the boom predicted by The Denver Post in 1897. A radio soap opera, Our Gal Sunday, and the book A Lady from Colorado, later adapted into an opera by Robert Ward, were based upon the life of Irish immigrant, Katie Lawder, who was orphaned at the age of 12 and lived in Colorado beginning at age 18. In 1888, she married Cecil Ernest Moon, an Englishman and Oxford graduate who later attained a title and a fortune. Katie took her cowgirl clothing and western frontier ways with her on trips with her husband to England. Ultimately she fell out of favor with Cecil and his family and the couple was divorced. She then lived entirely in Colorado and wished to continue to be called Lady Cecil Moon. She bought a ranch by 1901 for US$2,500 (). The town was then owned by the United States Forest Service and became a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) site in the 1930s. Some of the buildings from the town were moved, those that remained were burned by the Forest Service in the 1930s. The Manhattan Cemetery remains on Country Road 68C/162.

It is a concept album in which the songs depict characters who all live in the eponymous block of flats in London. Setting The exact setting of the stories told by the album's setting is somewhat amorphous. The real Turnpike House is a high-rise block of flats in Goswell Road, EC1, an area of ex-council blocks between Clerkenwell and Upper Street. The band had spent a lot of time in Turnpike House, as filmmaker Paul Kelly lived there during the period in which they were collaborating on What Have You Done Today, Mervyn Day?. However, Sarah Cracknell has said that the building imagined in the album is \\"not nearly as smart\\" as the real Turnpike House. Bob Stanley has said that he imagined the album's setting to be more suburban, \\"probably somewhere like Croydon or possibly Ponders End\\". Pete Wiggs has said that his experience of living in Croydon was the inspiration for \\"Side Streets\\" and \\"Slow Down at the Castle\\" (the Castle is a water tower in Park Hill Recreation Ground). However, the title of \\"The Birdman of EC1\\" refers to the postal district in which the real Turnpike House is located. Collaborations The album features two tracks co-written and produced by Xenomania (\\"Lightning Strikes Twice\\" and \\"Stars Above Us\\") as well as a guest vocal from 1970s pop star David Essex on \\"Relocate\\" (Essex had earlier appeared on the Saint Etienne album So Tough via sampled dialogue from the 1973 film That'll Be the Day). Releases Tales from Turnpike House was released 13 June 2005 on Sanctuary Records and preceded by a single for \\"Side Streets\\" on 6 June 2005. In the United States, the album was released 24 January 2006 by Savoy Jazz. Initial quantities of the UK release came with a bonus EP of children's music titled Up the Wooden Hills. The band felt that music for young children under seven was fed into unexceptional pop music, and wanted to make music that children and parents could enjoy together. Double- disc editions of the US release included instead the Savoy Nu Groove Sampler, containing six tracks from various Savoy Jazz releases, including \\"Side Streets\\" from the album itself. As part of the reissue programme of all Saint Etienne's albums, Tales from Turnpike House was re-released in a deluxe double CD edition featuring unreleased material and sleeve notes by Jeremy Deller in October 2010. Critical reception Tales from Turnpike House was very well- received from critics, holding an aggregate 79 out of 100 from Metacritic based on 22 reviews. The album's most favorable reviews, including a five-star review from Dorlan Lynskey of The Guardian, called it the group's best album yet, with praise going towards the album's songwriting, production, arrangements, sound, vocal harmonies and Sarah Cracknell's vocals. Ernesto Lechner wrote in his review for the Los Angeles Times that \\"If it's pop craftsmanship you are after, few can equal this melancholy concept album and the sheer virtuosity of its hooks\\", while Stylus Magazine's Edward Oculicz called it an \\"overwhelmingly forward, ambitious album for a group fifteen years into their career and long past their commercial prime who could have quite happily introduced no new ideas‚Äîmusical or thematical‚Äîand not challenged their dwindling but loyal fan-base.\\" Allmusic journalist Andy Kellman called it the band's most organic release since their fourth album Good Humor, highlighting Turnpike's concept as allowing \\"for a range of material that's as broad as what can be heard on any other Saint Etienne album.\\" Peter Relic of Rolling Stone, who also noted the variety of musical styles, called the record \\"an unabashedly joyful celebration of being British\\" that \\"could make an Anglophile out of anyone.\\" In a less positive review, Thomas Blatchford of Drowned in Sound called Tales from Turnpike House \\"A good enough record, but we know they can do better.\\" He felt the harmonies were \\"over-egged\\" and not complementary to Cracknell's lead vocals, and described the concept as difficult to grasp it due to it being \\"too downbeat to be uplifting and too uplifting to be downbeat\\". However, a reviewer from Q was the most negative towards the album. He found Saint Etienne's brand of indie disco \\"dated\\" and bashed the lyrical content as \\"a concept album of kitchen-sink dramas about Tony The Milkman and Doris The Housewife\\". Track listing * The Japanese edition includes two B-sides from the \\"Side Streets\\" single in the middle of the track listing. * The US edition contains a considerably rearranged track listing, adding some songs while removing others. \\"I'm Falling\\" is a B-side from the second single, \\"A Good Thing\\". * The 2010 deluxe edition included the original UK release of the album and a second disc consisting of rare and unreleased material. The three exclusive tracks from the US release were \\"mistakenly\\" left off the 2010 deluxe edition, but appeared on the 2011 single-disc reissue.

Kono set world records in four different weight classes: lightweight (149 pounds or 67.5 kilograms), middleweight (165 lb or 75 kg), light-heavyweight (182 lb or 82.5 kg), and middle-heavyweight (198 lb or 90 kg). Early life Of Japanese descent, Kono was born in Sacramento, California, on June 27, 1930. Kono's family was relocated to Tule Lake internment camp in 1942 during World War II. Sickly as a child, the desert air helped Kono's asthma. It was during the relocation that Kono was introduced to weightlifting by neighbors including the late Noboru \\"Dave\\" Shimoda, a member of the Tule Lake weightlifting and bodybuilding club and brother of actor Yuki Shimoda and his friends, Gotoh, Toda, and Bob Nakanishi. After 3¬Ω years they were released and Kono finished high school at Sacramento High. He later worked for the California Department of Motor Vehicles and attended Sacramento Junior College. Kono was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1950 but was kept home from the Korean War after officials learned of his Olympic potential. Career Kono was a gold medalist at both the 1952 Summer Olympics and 1956 Summer Olympics, and a silver medalist at the 1960 Summer Olympics under coach Bob Hoffman. Kono won the World Weightlifting Championships six consecutive times from 1953 to 1959 and was a three-time Pan American Games champion; in 1955, 1959, and 1963. A knee injury prevented him from qualifying for the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and the following year he retired from the sport. He set a total of 26 world records and 7 Olympic records, making him the most accomplished U.S. male weightlifter to date. Kono was also a successful bodybuilder, winning the F√©d√©ration Internationale Halt√©rophile et Culturiste Mr. Universe titles in 1954, 1955, 1957 and 1961. After his retirement he turned to coaching, taking on the Mexican 1968 Summer Olympics and West German 1972 Summer Olympics weightlifting teams before becoming head coach of the United States' Olympic weightlifting team at the 1976 Summer Olympics. During his weightlifting career in the 1960s, he developed a pair of bands to support knees during training. These eventually extended to the elbows and became standard weightlifting equipment. While he was coaching in Germany during the 1970s, his correspondence with Adidas led to the firm's development of low cut weightlifting shoes.  Awards  Along with his weightlifting and bodybuilding titles, Kono was an eight-time Amateur Athletic Union James E. Sullivan Award finalist, an award given annually to the top American amateur athlete. He was also one of the first members of the Hawaii Sports Hall of Fame in 1978. In 1990, Kono received the Association of Oldetime Barbell and Strongmen Highest Achievement Award and was inducted into the United States Olympic Hall of Fame. He was elected to the International Weightlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, the International Weightlifting Federation named Kono the \\"Lifter of the Century.\\" Portrayals Kono appeared in Universal Newsreel volume 32, number 63, August 6 1959.\\"One of the world's outstanding men with the barbell is Tommy Kono of Honolulu, an Olympian and winner of many international honors.

It is threatened in the wild, but widespread propagation and popularity in cultivation have reduced the demand on wild populations. Description Cephalocereus senilis is a tall, columnar species with clusters of stems that may grow to 5‚Äì15 m tall; the individual stems are usually unbranched, being unable to withstand the weight of side branches adequately. The most striking feature is the shaggy coat of long, white hairs suggestive of unkempt hair on an old man. The coat is a particularly striking silvery white on the young cactus; as the plant ages the stem begins to lose its covering. The flowers are red, yellow, or white, though the plant may not flower until 10‚Äì20 years old. Morphology and function of the coat The hairs are modified spines and they make many a plant appear almost snow-white; they serve to protect the plant from frost and sun. However, the hairs are only the radial spines of the cactus; they conceal formidable sharp yellow central spines that belie the inoffensive appearance of the hairy covering. Cultivation Cephalocereus senilis is a very popular cactus in cultivation, grown for its woolly appearance. It prefers a very well-drained soil mix (more so than many other cacti), and much bright sunlight, which encourages growth of the hair.

He came to prominence in the early 1980s as a member of Dio, and has been a member of Def Leppard since 1992 (replacing Steve Clark after his death). Campbell has also worked with Thin Lizzy, Whitesnake, Sweet Savage, Trinity, Riverdogs, and Shadow King. Biography Brian Downey in Thin Lizzy Campbell began playing guitar at the age of 12 with a Telecaster Thinline and Carlsbro Stingray amp. When he was 15, Campbell joined Teaser, which went on to become Sweet Savage, a NWOBHM band. In 1981 they released an EP consisting of four BBC Radio sessions and their first single, \\"Take No Prisoners\\". The band's song \\"Killing Time\\" was later covered by Metallica as a B-side for their \\"The Unforgiven\\" single, and was included on Metallica's Garage Inc. covers album. Campbell left Sweet Savage in early 1983 to join Dio after guitarist Jake E. Lee was offered Randy Rhoads's spot as Ozzy Osbourne's lead guitarist in December 1982. Dio When Campbell joined Dio, Ronnie James Dio, Vinny Appice, and former Rainbow bassist Jimmy Bain had most of the songs to the album Holy Diver already written. The album was a success and included Dio's biggest hit, \\"Rainbow in the Dark\\". A concert video, called In Concert, from this tour was released. The band also played at The 4th Monsters of Rock festival at Castle Donington, England in August 1983 and Monsters of Rock, Nurnburg, Germany in 1984. Dio returned to the studio to write and record the follow-up to Holy Diver. This album was called The Last in Line and charted at No. 23 in the US. \\"The Last in Line\\", \\"We Rock\\" and \\"Mystery\\" all became radio hits. A concert video from this tour called A Special From The Spectrum was released. The follow-up Sacred Heart was also a success, and managed to peak at No. 29 in the U.S. It featured the hits \\"Rock N Roll Children\\" and \\"Hungry For Heaven\\", the second of which was also included on the soundtrack to the film Vision Quest. Also around this time the band recorded the song \\"Hide in the Rainbow\\" for the Iron Eagle soundtrack, the last song Campbell would record with Dio. A live EP Intermission was also released. Craig Goldy played on the disc's only studio song \\"Time to Burn\\" and over-dubbed the rhythm parts on the live tracks. Campbell and the band parted company in 1986 and he joined Whitesnake. He was replaced by Goldy. Campbell's post-Dio relationship, including how Campbell considered his Dio years relative to his identity as a musician, has at times seemed positive, at times negative. For example, in 2003 Campbell said \\"[Playing in Dio] never mattered to me ‚Äì and still doesn't‚Ä¶ He's an incredible talent, but he's an awful businessman and way more importantly, one of the vilest people in the industry.\\" Campbell later stated that he regretted making the statement., and Ronnie James Dio stated in an article in Hit Parader that he wished Campbell \\"the best.\\" Further, in 2012 Campbell reunited with original Dio members bassist Jimmy Bain and drummer Vinnie Appice, along with vocalist Andrew Freeman, to form the Dio tribute band Last in Line, and Campbell subsequently made statements that suggest he had come to view his time in Dio more positively than he previously had indicated. Whitesnake In 1987, Campbell joined British hard rock band Whitesnake. The band had recently finished recording their multi-platinum selling self-titled album, when lead vocalist David Coverdale fired all other members of the band. He then put together a new line-up, featuring Campbell, guitarist Adrian Vandenberg, bassist Rudy Sarzo and drummer Tommy Aldridge. The first time they all met met was on set for the \\"Still of the Night\\" music video. Despite not playing on any of the songs, the line-up appeared in all promotional videos for the album, though Campbell did re-record the guitar solo for the single release of \\"Give Me All Your Love\\". In support of the band's self-titled album, Whitesnake embarked on a world tour, during which Campbell's wife was barred from traveling with the band due differences between her and Coverdale's wife Tawny Kitaen. After the tour ended, Covedale informed the rest of the band that the group's new album would be written by him and Vandenbeg. According to Campbell: \\"I knew deep inside that this wasn‚Äôt a band I would last in for too long.\\" Eventually Campbell was told by Whitesnake's tour manager that he'd been fired from the band. Campbell's relationship with Coverdale remained strained for many years, until 2008 when Def Leppard and Whitesnake toured together. \\"I had the chance to sit down with him and explain that he‚Äôd lost my respect when he did that in the 80s\\", said Campbell. \\"David was very apologetic, and pointed out that he was in this bad relationship, living in an ivory tower, having people do things instead of doing those things by himself. ‚Äî All this belongs in the past. We are all good now.\\" In 2015, Campbell joined Whitesnake on stage for a performance of \\"Still of the Night\\" in Sheffield, England. Campbell has stated, that he doesn't consider Whitesnake an important part of his career: \\"We were all great individually, but that lineup with those musicians never really gelled. It was fun at the time, and I was flattered to have been invited to be a part of the band, but it doesn‚Äôt mean an awful lot to me from a musical point of view.\\" Lou Gramm, Riverdogs and Shadow King After leaving Whitesnake, Campbell would go on to play on Lou Gramm's second solo album, Long Hard Look. Though Gramm toured in support of the album, Campbell would not join him. Now a free agent in the business, Campbell joined the group Riverdogs after being tapped to produce their first demo. As an official member of the band, he would contribute to their eponymous debut album in 1990. Campbell once again teamed up with Lou Gramm in 1991 to join Gramm's new band Shadow King. After a single eponymous album, one music video, and one live show, Campbell left the group to join Def Leppard. Shadow King soon disbanded following Campbell's departure as Gramm and bassist Bruce Turgon would return to Gramm's former band Foreigner. Def Leppard Campbell performing in 2007 In 1992, Campbell joined the rock band Def Leppard, after the release of their Adrenalize album. He replaced Steve Clark, who died on 8 January 1991. According to fellow guitarist Phil Collen, Campbell was able to lock right into the position very naturally by simply being himself. Campbell made his debut with the band by playing a show in a Dublin club to approximately 600 people. A week later, 20 April 1992, the band took the stage at the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, with their new guitarist. They performed, \\"Animal\\", \\"Let's Get Rocked\\", and the Queen classic, \\"Now I'm Here\\", with Brian May. Despite treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, Campbell continued to tour with Def Leppard during summer 2013, and he and the rest of the band have returned to the stage in summer 2014 as co- headliners with Kiss. Solo and other projects In 2005 Campbell released a solo album produced by Tor Hyams called Two Sides of If, which features cover versions of his favourite blues tunes and one original blues song. Terry Bozzio plays drums on the album. ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons guests on two songs, and Joan Osborne on one other song. In mid-2010/early 2011, when Def Leppard was on hiatus, Campbell agreed to join Thin Lizzy, long his favorite band. After the tour, which he said inspired him to play more aggressively, he asked Jimmy Bain and Vinny Appice--both members of the original band Dio--to get together for a Dio tribute project that ultimately became the band Last In Line. With singer Andrew Freeman, they recorded the album Heavy Crown. Bain died before the album was released, and Campbell praised his creativity and his presence, adding that Bain deserved co-writing credits on more of the early Dio songs. Personal life Campbell currently lives in Southern California and has two daughters with ex-wife Julie Campbell. After getting divorced, Campbell married his longtime girlfriend Caitlin Phaneuf on 4 July 2014. He also plays football regularly with Hollywood United F.C., a team composed mostly of celebrities and former professional football players. On 10 June 2013 Campbell revealed that he has Hodgkin's lymphoma. Though he announced in November 2013 that he was in partial remission, in June 2014 he took that back saying the statement was premature. He had stem-cell therapy in late 2014, and by October 2015 he announced that while the cancer is still there he was doing much better using immunotherapy, undergoing treatment every three weeks with pembrolizumab.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 29, 1998. After being fired from the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, Homer decides to join the United States Navy Reserve. The episode was the second and last to be written by Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia and was the final episode directed by Milton Gray. It guest-starred Rod Steiger as Captain Tenille and Bob Denver as himself, with one-time The Simpsons writer Michael Carrington making an appearance as the Drill Sergeant. This was the last episode Al Jean and Mike Reiss executive produced together, although Jean became showrunner again in season 13. Plot After Homer nearly causes the nuclear plant to go into meltdown by putting a doughnut into the reactor core to enlarge it, he is fired by Mr. Burns. While at home he sees a recruitment advertisement on television for the Naval Reserve and decides to enlist, with Moe, Barney, and Apu deciding to join him. Meanwhile, Bart purchases an earring, which an outraged Homer confiscates. Homer and the others are placed on a nuclear submarine. While participating in a military exercise, Homer unintentionally has the captain fired out of a torpedo tube and pilots the submarine into Russian waters, which is seen by the United States government as an attempt to defect. This event creates a political schism between the USA and Russia, leading to the revelation that the Soviet Union in fact never truly dissolved, complete with the Berlin Wall rising from the ground, Soviet troops and tanks appearing on the streets and Vladimir Lenin rising from his tomb in Moscow. Nuclear war is anticipated until the US Navy drops depth charges on Homer's sub, aiming either to destroy it or force it to surface. The consequent explosion causes a pinhole leak in the submarine's hull, but Homer uses Bart's earring to plug the leak and saves the submarine. The vessel surfaces and Homer is taken to be court-martialed, but because the officers on the review committee have done such awful things, Homer's punishment ends up being a mild dishonorable discharge and he immediately forgives Bart, as the earring saved his life. Production Bob Denver guest stars as himself. \\"Simpson Tide\\" was one of two season nine episodes that was executive produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it \\"for the comedy of it\\", but could not get the draft to work, so it was cut. It was difficult for them to figure out how to get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once. The Navy drill instructor, along with the announcer to \\"Exploitation Theater\\", was voiced by Michael Carrington, who had written the season four episode \\"Homer's Triple Bypass\\" and previously voiced Sideshow Raheem. Bob Denver voices himself in the episode and was directed by Mike Reiss. Rod Steiger guest stars as the captain and was directed by Al Jean. Cultural references Many parts of the episode, including the title, refer to the 1995 film Crimson Tide. The captain of the submarine is based on Captain Frank Ramsey, a character in the film who was portrayed by Gene Hackman. The opening couch gag is a recreation of the Rocky and Bullwinkle animated bumper seen at the end of each Bullwinkle short. The music accompanying it is also adapted from the original music in the bumper. Homer mentions that he and his friends joining the Navy is similar to The Deer Hunter, and the Russian roulette scene from the film is later parodied. Right before the submarine submerges, the song \\"In the Navy\\" is played and the Village People can be seen dancing. Homer dreams of being on \\"the planet of the doughnuts\\", which is reminiscent of the film Planet of the Apes. When aboard the submarine, Homer refers to one of the crew members as Mr. Sulu, a reference to the Star Trek character. Bart sings a portion of the song \\"Do the Bartman\\" and Ralph Wiggum comments that it \\"is so 1991\\", which was when the music video for the song was released. Grampa Simpson claims that he attacked John F. Kennedy on the PT-109 when Kennedy stated \\"Ich bin ein Berliner\\", leading to Grampa mistaking him for a Nazi. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"Simpson Tide\\" finished 29th in ratings for the week of March 23‚Äì29, 1998, with a Nielsen rating of 9.2, equivalent to approximately 9.0 million viewing households. It was the second highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, following The X-Files. Michael Schiffer, one of the writers of the film Crimson Tide, is said to have enjoyed this episode. Mike Reiss considers the sequence where Russia returns to being the Soviet Union to be \\"the nuttiest the show has ever been\\". The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it \\"a fairly straightforward episode where the biggest laugh comes from Homer being able to talk to penguins and Bart trying to impress his classmates by doing The Bartman.\\" ReferencesExternal links *\\"Simpson Tide\\" at The Simpsons.com  Category:The Simpsons (season 9) episodes Category:1998 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about communism Category:Berlin Wall in fiction Category:Television episodes set in Moscow Category:Television episodes set in Russia Category:Television episodes set in the Soviet Union Category:Cultural depictions of Vladimir Lenin Category:Cultural depictions of John F.

Pasternak spent the Hollywood \\"Golden Age\\" of musicals at MGM Studios, producing many successful musicals with singing stars like Deanna Durbin, Kathryn Grayson and Jane Powell, as well as swimmer/bathing beauty Esther Williams' films. He produced Judy Garland's final MGM film, Summer Stock, which was released in 1950. Pasternak worked in the film industry for 45 years, from the later silent era until shortly past the end of the classical Hollywood cinema in the early 1960s. Biography=Early life He was born to a Jewish family in Szil√°gysomly√≥, Austria-Hungary (now »òimleu Silvaniei, Romania). His father was a town clerk and Pasternak was one of eleven children. In 1920, he emigrated to the US as a teenager and stayed with an uncle in Philadelphia. He worked in a factory, punching holes in leather belts, and did a variety of other jobs. He also studied acting in New York. Assistant Director In 1922, Pasternak gained a job as a busboy at Paramount's Astoria studio in Queens, New York City at $8 a week; after a year he was head waiter and making $120 a week, including tips. He quit in 1923 to become an assistant for director Allan Dwan and worked his way up from fourth assistant at $16 a week to first assistant at $75 a week. He worked as an assistant director on The Phantom of the Opera (1925) and It's the Old Army Game (1926). He tried directing, a two-reeler with El Brendel. It was seen by Wesley Ruggles who offered him a job at Universal Studios as an assistant director at $35 a week. Germany In 1928, Universal sent Pasternak to Europe as an associate producer to work on German-language films for the international market. Pasternak produced a series of movies directed by, and often starring, William Dieterle: The Brandenburg Arch in 1929 with Paul Henckels and June Marlowe; Triumph of Love and Silence in the Forest also in 1929; Rustle of Spring and Ludwig II, King of Bavaria, a drama, both in 1930, and One Hour of Happiness in 1931. Pasternak also produced three films directed by Edmund Heuberger and starring Eddie Polo: Secret Police (1929), Witnesses Wanted (1930), and Of Life and Death (1930). Other Pasternak films included The Daredevil Reporter (1929), written by Billy Wilder, starring Eddie Polo and directed by Ernst Laemmle; Next, Please! (1930) directed by Erich Sch√∂nfelder; Two People (1930) with Charlotte Susa directed by Erich Waschneck; The Great Longing (1930), directed by Steve Sekely; Seitenspr√ºnge (Infidelity, 1931); Ich geh' aus und Du bleibst da (The Inconstant: I go out and you stay here in German and French, 1931); Der Storch streikt (The Stork Strikes, 1931); The Night Without Pause (1931) with Sig Arno co-directed by Andrew Marton; Bobby geht los (Bobby goes off, 1931); A Tremendously Rich Man (1932); Five from the Jazz Band (1932) directed by Erich Engel; and The Rebel (1932), a historical epic directed by Curtis Bernhardt, Edwin H. Knopf and star Luis Trenker. Pasternak shot Secret Agent (1932) and Johnny Steals Europe (1932) both with Harry Piel, then A Tremendously Rich Man (1932) with director Steve Sekely, Die unsichtbare Front (The Invisible Secretary, 1933) and Pardon, t√©vedtem (Excuse me, I was wrong, 1933). (Note translations are basic, not officially approved titles.) Hungary When Hitler came to power in Germany, Pasternak moved to Hungary. There he did a series of films starring Franciska Gaal: Romance in Budapest (1933) with Sekely (also shot in German as Scandal in Budapest); A Precocious Girl (1934), directed by Max Neufeld and Richard Eichberg; Spring Parade (1934); Peter (1934) directed by Henry Koster; Little Mother (1934) (later remade in Hollywood as Bachelor Mother); and Catherine the Last (1936). Universal in Hollywood Pasternak (right) receiving his star on Hollywood Boulevard from Johnny Grant with Gene Kelly on the left on July 29, 1991. Universal recalled Pasternak, giving him a $500 a week contract. He brought back Henry Koster with him and the two men set about making the sort of movie they had in Europe. \\"No one's going to get sick or die in my pictures\\", Pasternak said at the time. \\"That's no form of entertainment.\\" After seeing her in the short Every Sunday (1936), Pasternak cast 14-year-old Canadian singer Deanna Durbin in Three Smart Girls (also 1936), directed by Koster. The film became a huge hit and reputedly saved Universal from bankruptcy. He followed it with two more Durbin films, One Hundred Men and a Girl (1937), directed by Koster, and Mad About Music (1938), directed by Norman Taurog. In 1938, Pasternak did a comedy, Youth Takes a Fling, then was back with Durbin for That Certain Age (1938), and Three Smart Girls Grow Up (1939). In all, Pasternak made ten films with Durbin. Pasternak soon discovered another talented soprano, Gloria Jean, who began her own series in 1939, starting with The Under-Pup (1939). He produced Durbin again in First Love (1939). He had a large hit with the comedy Western Destry Rides Again (1939), starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart, which helped revitalise Dietrich's career. Pasternak alternated between the three female stars ‚Äì with Durbin he did It's a Date (1940), Spring Parade (1940) (a remake of his 1934 film), Nice Girl? (1940) and It Started with Eve (1941). With Jean he did A Little Bit of Heaven (1940), a sort of sequel to The Under-Pup. Finally, with Dietrich he did Seven Sinners (1940) (with John Wayne) and The Flame of New Orleans (1941). In June 1941, after finishing Eve, Pasterrnak left Universal. Although he still had two years to run on his contract, he had \\"differences of opinion\\" with the studio's management, and by mutual consent the parties elected to terminate the contract. MGM In June 1941, Pasternak announced he had joined Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer as a producer for a reported $3,500 a week. Several studios had been interested in placing him under contract, but Louis B. Mayer wanted Pasternak and allowed the producer several concessions. Mayer assigned young soprano Kathryn Grayson, who had only made one film for MGM, to Pasternak's unit so that he might make her into a star like Durbin. Pasternak later sat on the executive committeeScott Eyman: Lion of Hollywood ‚Äì The Life and Legend of Louis B. Mayer, p.363 Linked 2014-01-28 and came to be regarded as one of the three most important persons in the company, alongside Louis B. Mayer and Vice President Sam Katz.Larry Ceplair, Steven Englun: The Inquisition in Hollywood: Politics in the Film Community, 1930‚Äì1960, p.312 Linked 2014-01-28 At MGM he continued to produce operetta films, starting with Seven Sweethearts (1942) starring Grayson, and Presenting Lily Mars (1943) starring Judy Garland. Both films were successful at the box-office.. Pasternak followed these with Thousands Cheer (1943) with Grayson and Gene Kelly, which was a huge hit; Song of Russia (1944), a musical which later became problematic because of its pro-Russian viewpoint; Two Girls and a Sailor (1944) with June Allyson, Van Johnson and Gloria De Haven, and Music for Millions (1944) with Allyson and Margaret O'Brien. All these films were hits. Pasternak was responsible for Esther Williams' first proper vehicle, Thrill of a Romance (1945), co-starring Van Johnson; it made over $3 million in profits. Similarly well received by audiences was Anchors Aweigh (1945) with Grayson, Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra. Pasternak also made several non-musical romantic comedy hits, including Her Highness and the Bellboy (1945) with Hedy Lamarr and Robert Walker, and No Leave, No Love (1946) with Johnson. However, around this time Pasternak mostly specialized in musicals: Two Sisters from Boston (1946) with Grayson and Allyson was a box-office success, as was, Holiday in Mexico (1946) with Walter Pidgeon and Jane Powell in her debut for MGM. However, The Unfinished Dance (1947) with O'Brien and Cyd Charisse lost over a million dollars ‚Äì the first Pasternak MGM film to do so. This Time for Keeps (1947) with Esther Williams, was profitable. In 1948 Pasternak had very mixed results. Three Daring Daughters in 1948 with Powell and Jeanette MacDonald, while popular, lost money. Pasternak also tried his first drama in the U.S. with Big City (1948), starring O'Brien, which was a big money loser. More popular were the 1948 musicals On an Island with You with Williams; A Date with Judy with Jane Powell, Wallace Beery and Elizabeth Taylor; and Luxury Liner again with Powell. Pasternak unfortunately had a big flop with the Sinatra-Grayson musical The Kissing Bandit that same year, which lost MGM over $2 million.Variety says that it earned $1.8 million; Pasternak bounced back with In the Good Old Summertime (1949) with Garland and Johnson, and introduced Mario Lanza in That Midnight Kiss with Kathryn Grayson, which was a solid hit. Nancy Goes to Rio with Powell, a remake of It's a Date, made a minor loss. In 1950, The Toast of New Orleans with Grayson was a solid hit, as was Duchess of Idaho with Williams. Pasternak produced the final Judy Garland film at MGM, Summer Stock in 1950, co-starring Gene Kelly, and then had the biggest hit of his career to date with The Great Caruso (1951), a vehicle for Mario Lanza which made almost $4 million in profit for the studio. After the popular Rich, Young and Pretty (1951) with Powell, Pasternak made a film noir with Mickey Rooney, The Strip (1951) which flopped. More typical was Skirts Ahoy! (1952) with Esther Williams; The Merry Widow (1952) with Lana Turner and Fernando Lamas; and Because You're Mine (1952) with Lanza. Small Town Girl (1953) with Powell lost money, as did Latin Lovers (1953) with Turner and Ricardo Montalb√°n, but Easy to Love (1953) with Williams and Johnson was another hit. Pasternak again tried a drama, this time with Turner, Flame and the Flesh (1954), but it was not a notable success. However, The Student Prince (1954) with Ann Blyth and Edmund Purdom miming to Mario Lanza singing, was a huge success. Pasternak did Hit the Deck (1955) with Powell, Vic Damone and Debbie Reynolds, which was popular but failed to recoup its cost. Athena in 1955 with Powell, Reynolds, Damone and Purdom, was a straight out flop. Meet Me in Las Vegas (1955) with Charisse was well received, but failed to recoup its cost. The industry was changing, and musicals were becoming increasingly unprofitable for MGM. Conversely, a tough biopic Pasternak produced about Ruth Etting, Love Me or Leave Me (1955), starring Doris Day and James Cagney, was a hit. In 1956, Pasternak published his memoir, Easy the Hard Way. Pasternak had two big flop musicals, The Opposite Sex (1956), a remake of The Women with Allyson, and Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957) with Dean Martin. Also unsuccessful was the Jean Simmons comedy This Could Be the Night (also 1957). It was then time for a change. Euterpe In April 1956, Pasternak left MGM after 14 years. He set up the independent production company Euterpe with Sam Katz.TCM: Gidget ‚Äì production notes Linked 2014-01-28AFI: Euterpe Productions, Inc. Linked 2014-01-28AFI: Euterpe, Inc. Linked 2014-01-28IMDb: Euterpe Linked 2014-01-28 They made an agreement with Columbia to finance their films, and announced several projects: The Chiselers starring Alan Ladd; Three Blondes; Gidget, based on the novel by Frederick Kohner; and Nora, an original screenplay by Felix Jackson. However Euterpe and Columbia could not come to terms and dissolved their agreement in November 1957. Pasternak set up Euterpe back at MGM. He was an immediate success, turning out four hits in a row: a highly regarded thriller, Party Girl (1958), with Robert Taylor and Cyd Charisse; two comedies with David Niven: Ask Any Girl (1959) with Shirley MacLaine and Please Don't Eat the Daisies (1960) with Day; and a teen comedy, Where the Boys Are (1960), which introduced a group of new stars: George Hamilton, Dolores Hart, Yvette Mimieux, Connie Francis, Jim Hutton, and Paula Prentiss. In the 1960s, Pasternak produced a mix of hits and misses. He reunited Hutton and Prentiss in The Horizontal Lieutenant (1962) but it was not as popular as Boys. Then he had a failure with Billy Rose's Jumbo (1962) starring Day, which lost almost $4 million. However, Pasternak responded with a comedy starring Glenn Ford, The Courtship of Eddie's Father (1963) that was a hit; the film featured Ronny Howard (later known as Ron Howard), showing the producer still retained an ability to discover young performers. Less successful was A Ticklish Affair (1963) with Shirley Jones and Looking for Love (1964) with Francis and Hutton. He did a poorly-received musical with Ann-Margret (in a part turned down by Doris Day), Made in Paris (1966), then made two Elvis Presley films co-starring Shelley Fabares, Girl Happy (1965) and Spinout (1966), both of which made money. He also did a Natalie Wood comedy Penelope (1966), which was a box-office disappointment. Pasternak produced the 1965, 1966 and 1967 Academy Awards. In 1966 he was honored with a retrospective of his work. 20th Century Fox In 1967, Pasternak left MGM and became affiliated with 20th Century Fox, but made only one film for Fox, The Sweet Ride (1968). Pasternak had a stroke before filming, and Sweet Ride would turn out to be his last film. In 1968, he was also stricken with Parkinson's disease. He recovered slightly two years later but made no more films. He said at the time: \\"I am proud that I have produced 105 pictures and not one of them is adults only.\\" In 1980, he estimated his films had earned $400 million. \\"If I had a percentage I'd be the richest man in town\\", he said.

Billed by Midway as \\"A Basket Brawl\\", the game features two-on-two full court basketball games in which players are encouraged to punch opposing players and steal the ball from them. Arch Rivals allows players to select from a variety of fictional teams (although arcade operators can change the team names to reflect real ones) and players. One playable character, \\"Tyrone\\" was also featured in the animated Power Team segments of the television series Video Power. Home versions of the game were released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive as well as the Game Gear. Emulated versions of the game were included in the compilations Midway Arcade Treasures 2, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition, and Midway Arcade Origins. The game has been considered a forerunner to Midway's popular arcade basketball game, NBA Jam. Gameplay In game screenshot Games generally follow standard basketball rules; a full game consists of four quarters, with four minutes each. Each team has two players, and the objective of the game is to outscore the opponent until the final buzzer sounds. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or to shoot it in this battle royale. If the game results in a tie after four quarters, multiple sudden death overtime periods are added, in which case whoever scores the next basket will win the game. Every overtime period is one minute. If, however, no score occurs after overtime the procedure repeats. The difference between Arch Rivals and other basketball titles is the ability to freely punch an opposing player without penalty and steal the ball away. The referee will only call shot clock violations. Also unique to the game are various on-court hazards such as soda cans and candy wrappers thrown onto the floor. If a ballhandler steps on those, he falls onto the floor allowing his opponent to steal the ball from him. Players could also fall over the referee in the same way as the objects on the floor, as well as steal the ball with a maneuver called the \\"flying leap\\" where the player would jump forwards at the opposition ball carrier. If the maneuver missed, the player would roll along the floor. If successful, the player would tackle the opposition holding the ball. In the Arcade version the \\"flying leap\\" would pull the opposition's shorts down, revealing the opponent's underwear. On home ports of the game, these graphics were left out. Players There are eight playable characters, each with a unique characteristic. They are: *Blade: A crowd pleaser *Hammer: Rebound king *Lewis: Top shooter *Mohawk: Tough & mean *Moose: A real champ *Reggie: All- American *Tyrone: Defensive giant *Vinnie: A great player Teams The teams in Arch Rivals are selected at random, with Player 1 playing as the home team and Player 2 (or the computer) as the away team. The teams in the arcade version are Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Denver, Natural High and Brawl State. Also, the game could be set up to reflect the names and colors of local teams through the custom \\"Hometown Heroes\\" feature. Presentation Whenever a basket is scored (for either two or three points), there are many random scenes that may be played. One scene has the coach yelling at his players, another features players from the other team groaning in disgust, and two scenes have cheerleaders shouting: \\"Go team go!\\" or \\"Yay team!\\" Sometimes, the backboard can be shattered with a rim-rattling slam dunk. This effect was later carried over to the much better-known NBA Jam. The TV studio depicted in the game is that of the fictional WIDB-TV. It is shown after the end of each period and also at halftime. In addition, after the first and third quarters plus overtime, a \\"Coaches Corner\\" screen also appears, providing tips on how to become a better player. The cheer-leading squad performs the halftime show. The final stats are shown at the end of the game, showing how many points the human-controlled player scored, and also the number of steals and rebounds, and shooting percentage. Ports The four home ports of the game have lower- quality graphics than the arcade version, due to being released on 8 and 16-bit systems. The NES version of the game contains a glitch where a 3-point dunk can be achieved. The Sega Genesis version received poorer reception due to a glitch where almost 95% of shots taken from anywhere on the court would result in a basket. It was also included on Midway Arcade Treasures 2 for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and GameCube, Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition for the PC, and Midway Arcade Origins for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/14/midway-arcade-origins-review Reception Sinclair User and Computer and Video Games published positive reviews of Arch Rivals, while commenting that the game was best suited to fans of the sport.

A double-disc deluxe edition was released on 3 May 2010 by Heavenly Records. Background Following two relatively uniform albums, Good Humor and Sound of Water, Finisterre contains a wide mixture of sounds and styles (as would its successor Tales from Turnpike House). The album returned to the inclusion of vocal interludes between songs as last heard on their album So Tough and a more angular, electronic sound, particularly on tracks such as \\"Action\\", \\"Shower Scene\\" and \\"New Thing\\". \\"Language Lab\\" and \\"Summerisle\\" recall the ambient style of Sound of Water, while \\"Stop and Think It Over\\" would not have been out of place on Good Humor or its predecessor, Tiger Bay. The vocal interludes were supplied by Michael Jayston's narration as featured in the film released to accompany the album, also called Finisterre. The film was directed by Paul Kelly and Kieran Evans and was born out of visuals used to accompany certain tracks from the album shown during their live shows. The film debuted at a sold-out show in October 2002 at the Royal Festival Hall on London's Southbank, and was re-released to select screens in 2005. It is currently available on DVD. The album sleeve features a photograph of the East London tower block Ronan Point shortly after it collapsed in 1968 with the loss of four lives. Nitsuh Abebe of Pitchfork Media scored the album 7.6 out of ten and wrote that \\"[t]he big comeback on Finisterres part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently\\", citing \\"B92\\" as a highlight.

The company publishes a 60,000 circulation monthly publication which is distributed to in- town locations and neighborhoods on the first Thursday of each month. https://creativeloafing.com/ is the website for the company and it also has a YouTube Channel featuring its video work over the years and a weekly \\"Live from the Archives\\" program featuring local musicians and bands. The company has historically been a part of the alternative weekly newspapers association in the United States. Creative Loafing began as a family-owned business in 1972 by Deborah and Chick Eason, expanding to other cities in the Southern United States in the late 1980s and 1990s. In 2007 it doubled its circulation with the purchase of the Chicago Reader and Washington City Paper; the $40 million debt it incurred, along with an economic recession, forced the company into bankruptcy one year later. The parent company, Creative Loafing, Inc. was dissolved and Atalaya sold off the Chicago Reader. In 2012, SouthComm purchased all of the properties and then sold off each of the papers to other publishers in 2018. The Atlanta Creative Loafing launched the career of many writers and has been an institution in Atlanta's cultural scene.

Holdings  Creative Loafing, LLC is the name of the Publishing Company that owns Creative Loafing. Creative Loafing, LLC purchased the assets of Creative Loafing Atlanta from SouthComm in February, 2017 which put the paper back into the Eason Family's hands. * Creative Loafing (Atlanta) of Atlanta, Georgia, sold in July 2012 to SouthComm Communications * Chicago Reader of Chicago, Illinois, sold in May 2012 to Wrapports * Creative Loafing Charlotte of Charlotte, North Carolina, sold in October 2011 to SouthComm, sold in August 2014 to Womack Newspapers * Creative Loafing Sarasota of Sarasota, Florida, sold in December 2010 to the Sarasota Herald-Tribune, merged into Ticket * Creative Loafing Tampa of Tampa, Florida, sold in October 2011 to SouthComm * Washington City Paper of Washington, D.C., sold in July 2012 to SouthComm * Creative Loafing filed for Bankruptcy protection in 2008 during the crash. At the time it declared bankruptcy, Creative Loafing owned six alternative weeklies and was the nation's 2nd largest publisher of alternative weeklies behind the Village Voice Company. Other newspapers the company published over its 40-year history included: *Creative Loafing Greenville of Greenville, South Carolina, sold in 2001 to Debby Eason, renamed MetroBEAT, folded in 2005 * Creative Loafing Savannah of Savannah, Georgia, sold in 2001 to Debby Eason, merged into Connect Savannah * Gwinnett Loaf in north suburban Atlanta, Georgia, closed in April 2001 * The Scene nightlife weekly of Atlanta, Georgia, closed in March 2001 * The Spectator of Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, 1997‚Äì2002, sold to Independent Weekly * Topside Loaf in north suburban Atlanta, Georgia, closed in April 2001  History =Early years in Atlanta Deborah Eason, a photographer for Delta Air Lines, and Elton \\"Chick\\" Eason, a math professor at Georgia State University, founded Creative Loafing Atlanta in 1972 after the couple attended a 25-attendee Georgia State University lecture by a visiting Russian scholar. This, and other poorly attended events, convinced them to start Creative Loafing Atlanta to inform the public about all of the city‚Äôs cultural happenings‚Äîfestivals, concerts, Wicca meetings. They originally began publishing it from the basement of their home in the Morningside neighborhood of Atlanta. After a trial run of a monthly magazine called P-s- s-t . . . A Guide to Creative Loafing in Atlanta, the Easons decided to launch a weekly free publication titled simply Creative Loafing. The four-person editorial staff operated out of the living and dining rooms of the Easons‚Äô Morningside home; the darkroom was in the basement. The print run of the first edition‚Äîall of eight pages‚Äîwas 12,000 copies. Expansion in the South Early 1970s copy of Creative Loafing. Creative Loafing wasn‚Äôt the first alternative weekly Atlanta had seen, but over the years, its size and ambitions crowded out competitors‚ÄîThe Great Speckled Bird; Poets, Artists & Madmen; The Sunday Paper. After a decade and a half in Atlanta, the Easons established new Creative Loafing weeklies in March 1987 in Charlotte, North Carolina, and in 1988 in Tampa, Florida. Other expansions or acquisitions included newspapers in Greenville, South Carolina; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Savannah, Georgia. The company also expanded its footprint in the Atlanta area, starting two community weeklies, Gwinnett Loaf and Topside Loaf, covering the suburbs north of the city in Cobb, Gwinnett, southern Forsyth and northern Fulton counties. Bowing to reader complaints about racy advertisements in Creative Loafing Atlanta, the Easons established a separate Atlanta publication, The Scene, for nightlife listings. These three Atlanta- area publications would later be folded back into Creative Loafing Atlanta in 2001. By July 2007, Creative Loafing became a mini-empire with four papers in three states and purchased two heralded alt-weeklies‚Äîthe Chicago Reader and the Washington City Paper‚Äîand The Straight Dope, a longtime Reader-syndicated column by Cecil Adams. Sale to Eason Children Ben Eason, son of Deborah and Elton, purchased the Tampa paper from his parents in 1994 and changed its name to the Weekly Planet. In 1998 he expanded the paper and launched a second Weekly Planet in Sarasota, Florida. Two years later, in September 2000, he and his two sisters led a group of investors to purchase a controlling interest in the entire Creative Loafing chain, and subsequently brought the Planet papers into the fold. After a false start during which the May 31, 2006, edition of Tampa's Planet was prematurely published with a Creative Loafing banner, the Tampa paper officially reverted to its former name and the Sarasota paper became Creative Loafing Sarasota. Shortly after the sale, Debby Eason purchased Creative Loafing Greenville and Savannah properties back from her children. The Greenville paper was renamed MetroBEAT, while Creative Loafing Savannah was merged into Connect Savannah. Partnership with Cox To help finance the 2000 deal transferring ownership to Ben Eason's group, media conglomerate Cox Enterprises purchased a 25% minority share of the company for approximately US$5 million. In the process, Cox executives filled two seats on Creative Loafing's eight-member board. An uneasy four-year relationship between the two companies followed, as Cox also owned Atlanta's only daily, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, as well as television and radio outlets in the Atlanta area. After the Journal-Constitution in April 2003 quietly launched its own free entertainment weekly named Access Atlanta, in direct competition with Creative Loafing, the Easons and Creative Loafing board members voted to censure the two Cox executives for unethical conduct, and by June 2004 both companies agreed to allow the chain to repurchase its shares from Cox. Chicago and Washington On July 24, 2007, Creative Loafing announced the purchase of the Washington City Paper and the Chicago Reader, along with the Reader properties The Straight Dope and the SDMB, the associated Internet message board. In order to accomplish the acquisitions, the company borrowed $40 million. The ensuing economic slump hurt ad sales, and CL Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 29, 2008. In a bankruptcy auction on August 25, 2009, Atalaya Capital Management of New York City, emerged as the new owner, paying $5 million (it was also CL's largest creditor, owed $30 million before the bankruptcy). The Easons had put in a bid of $2.3 million, and with the change in ownership, Ben Eason was removed as CEO. Dissolution Over the next two years, 2010-2011, Atalaya sold Creative Loafing's remaining mid-market papers. The first to be sold was Creative Loafing Sarasota, which was shuttered in December 2010, with its brand sold for an undisclosed sum to The New York Times Company, then- publisher of the competing Sarasota Herald-Tribune. The Herald-Tribune published its own free weekly product under the Creative Loafing name for some time after the sale. In October 2011, Creative Loafing Charlotte and Creative Loafing Tampa were sold to SouthComm Inc., a publisher of alternative weeklies based in Nashville, Tennessee. Creative Loafing three largest newspapers continued under Atalaya's ownership for one more year. In May 2012, the Chicago Reader was sold to Wrapports, publisher of the competing Chicago Sun- Times, in a deal reported at $3 million. Two months later, on July 3, Creative Loafing Atlanta and the Washington City Paper were sold to SouthComm, for an undisclosed sum, and CL Inc. ceased to exist. In 2016, the Charlotte Creative Loafing was sold to Womack Publishing of North Carolina. In 2018, the Charlotte Creative Loafing was sold again and ceased publishing a print version. In February, 2017, Ben Eason re-purchased Creative Loafing in Atlanta and took the publication from a weekly to a monthly as part of a plan to take the company in a direction more compatible to the new digital publishing economy. The Creative Loafing in Tampa was sold to a group from Ohio in 2018.

Production and reactions Potassium superoxide is produced by burning molten potassium in an atmosphere of oxygen. :K + ‚Üí The salt consists of and ions, linked by ionic bonding. The O‚àíO distance is 1.28 √Ö. Reactivity Potassium superoxide is a strong oxidant, able to convert oxides into peroxides or molecular oxygen.

Because it reacts with water, is often studied in organic solvents. Since the salt is poorly soluble in nonpolar solvents, crown ethers are typically used. The tetraethylammonium salt is also known. Representative reactions of these salts involve using superoxide as a nucleophile, e.g., in converting alkyl bromides to alcohols and acyl chlorides to diacyl peroxides. Applications The Russian Space Agency has had success using potassium superoxide in chemical oxygen generators for its spacesuits and Soyuz spacecraft. has also been used in canisters for rebreathers for fire fighting and mine rescue work, but had limited use in scuba rebreathers because of its dangerously explosive reaction with water.

Synopsis The musical is set in Heartsville, U.S.A, once upon a time. The exact time period is not specified, but the play takes place across a school year, beginning on the first day and ending at prom. This is an alternate, fairy tale America, where the majority of the world is homosexual, with heterosexuals subject to heterophobia. Despite the fairy tale aspect, the world is essentially equivalent to ours, with references to Star Trek, the internet, Wayne Gretzky, and many other recognizable people, things or ideas. The majority of the play is set at Heartsville High, where the main characters are students. As the school year begins, DJ and student Tank reminds the world that Zanna is on the look-out for any extra love that needs to be shared (\\"Who's Got Extra Love?\\"). Zanna finds new kid Steve Bookman (a quarterback) lonely. Zanna sets him up with Mike Singer, a chess champion and idol of school. (In the musical's world, chess players are sex symbols, and football players nobodies.) Their love blooms quickly (\\"I Think We Got Love\\"). Meanwhile, Kate Aspero, all-around overachiever, finds love with Roberta, a part-time waitress. Kate had long resisted Zanna's efforts to find love for her, citing \\"SATs, ACTs, APs, and GPAs\\" as being more worthy of her time, while Roberta seemed destined to a life of cheating girlfriends. She laments this in \\"I Ain't Got Time,\\" much to the chagrin of the diner's customers. Spurred by Zanna's magic, Roberta impresses Kate so strongly (\\"Ride 'Em\\") that they become a couple. Zanna, pleased with his success, settles down for the night, singing \\"Zanna's Song\\" as he says goodnight to his magic wand and goodbye to his feathered friend Cindy, who migrates to Fort Lauderdale. The next day, the kids decide to create a musical addressing the controversy over heterosexuals in the military. Their play includes the song \\"Be A Man,\\" touting the impressive homosexual leaders of history (including Leonardo da Vinci, Alexander the Great, and the ancient Spartans), and \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" an overly dramatic ballad about a heterosexual couple forced to hide their love from the Army. In a reprise of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell,\\" Kate and Steve realize they have feelings for each other, a fact they try quickly to forget, as their town is extremely heterophobic. Some amount of time passes. At the \\"I'm Okay, You're Okay Corral,\\" Mike proposes moving in with Steve after graduation, but Steve, trying to avoid the issue, believes they should slow down. Three Corral regulars, Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, insist that love should go \\"Fast.\\" Steve, scared and confused runs from Mike, who describes Steve's unpredictable behavior in \\"I Could Write Books.\\" Later, and much to the amusement of Tex, Bronco, and Loretta, it is also revealed that Zanna has feelings for Steve. Kate and Steve's perplexing behavior leads Mike and Roberta to playfully suggest to each other \\"Don't You Wish We Could Be In Love?\\", but the light-hearted song turns serious as Kate, Steve, and Zanna all join in, reflecting on their relationships. The focus shifts to the State Chess Finals. Steve promises to exchange varsity rings with Mike after the match, while Kate puts all her effort into being a perfect girlfriend to Roberta. Mike's hesitation in the final match causes Roberta to lead a raucous cheer that becomes the song \\"Whatcha Got?\\"‚Äîa successful cheer indeed, causing Mike to win the tournament. But in the resulting celebration, Kate and Steve kiss, throwing the town into chaos. Mike, Steve, Kate, and Roberta are devastated (\\"Do You Know What It's Like?\\"). Kate and Steve run into classmates Candi and Buck, who have suddenly distanced themselves from the heterosexual couple. Unable to handle living in a heterophobic environment, Kate and Steve plan to run away from Heartsville. Zanna, desperate to make the world safe for them, finds a spell that, while likely to cost him his powers (and a possible deterioration of taste and style), will make everything better, or so he hopes. Deciding that nothing done for love can ever hurt, Zanna performs the spell (\\"'Tis a Far, Far Better Thing I Do/Blow Winds\\"). Zanna's spell is a success, in a way. Kate and Steve are King and Queen of the Prom, and everyone there is singing \\"Straight To Heaven.\\" But Zanna finds that everyone is now heterosexual, and that no one can remember what life was like before the spell, to the point that Zanna himself is ostracized. He reflects on his life, hoping that \\"Someday You Might Love Me.\\" The students, overhearing this song, realize that they were mistaken in abandoning their friend, singing a reprise of \\"Straight to Heaven\\" with \\"straight\\" replaced with \\"right.\\" Prom is a success, and Zanna is invited to a post-prom party, but he chooses to stay behind and think for a while. On his way home, he drops a shoe, and true to fairy tales, Tank rushes to return it to him, revealing not just his memories of before the spell but his love of Zanna, begging \\"Sometime, Do You Think We Could Fall In Love?\\" The happy couple is joined by the ensemble for a reprise of \\"Sometime, Do You Think...\\" at the curtain call.

His great contribution to the study of history was in the field of landscape history. Hoskins demonstrated the profound impact of human activity on the evolution of the English landscape in a pioneering book: The Making of the English Landscape. His work has had lasting influence in the fields of local and landscape history and historical and environmental conservation. Life William George Hoskins was born at 26‚Äì28 St David's Hill, Exeter, Devon on 22 May 1908: his father, like his grandfather, was a baker. He won a scholarship to Hele's School in 1918, and attended the University College of South West England where he gained BSc and MSc degrees in economics by the age of 21. Both his MSc in 1929 and his PhD in 1938 were on the history of Devon. The remainder of his life was devoted to university teaching and the authorship of historical works. He died on 11 January 1992 in Cullompton, Devon. Academic career Hoskins was appointed Assistant Lecturer in Commerce at University College, Leicester in 1931. He found the trade statistics to be dull lecture material, but he enjoyed the evenings that he spent teaching archaeology and local history at Vaughan College. His academic researches covered historical demography, urban history, agrarian history, the evolution of vernacular architecture, landscape history and local history. He became a member of the Leicestershire Archaeological Society in September 1935. After the award of his doctorate Hoskins was appointed Reader in English Local History at University College, Leicester (1938). In 1952, Hoskins resigned from his posts at University College, Leicester, and on the Leicestershire Victoria County History Committee to become Reader in Economic History in the University of Oxford. In his obituary, this was stated to be generally acknowledged as a mistake. The Making of the English Landscape In The Making of the English Landscape, Hoskins explains features like the distinctive ridge and furrow pattern in open field system farming, seen here at Wood Stanway, Gloucestershire. In 1955, Hoskins published the book that was to make his name. The Making of the English Landscape is a landscape history of England and a seminal text in that discipline and in local history. The brief history of some one thousand years has become a standard text in local and environmental history courses. Hoskins sets out his stall in the introduction with \\"No book exists to describe the manner in which the various landscapes of this country came to assume the shape and appearance they now have...\\".The Making of the English Landscape, 1955. Introduction. The brief concluding chapter contains only one image, Plate 82, \\"The completed English landscape\\" showing a tall tree in a wide open field, a strip of hedges and villages just visible in the distance. The chapter laments the damage caused to parts of the English landscape, mentioning bulldozers and tractors, nuclear bombers and by-passes, and ends by celebrating again the wealth of detail within a few hundred yards of Hoskins' study window at Steeple Barton. The book has been well received by critics. Penelope Lively describes the book as \\"a marvellous, robust, opinionated account of the landscape as narrative\\". William Boyd describes it as \\"an absolute trailblazer, a revolution.\\" Boyd notes that W. H. Auden \\"revered\\" the book, and that reading Hoskins had enabled him to \\"read\\" a landscape as a \\"historical palimpsest\\". Local historian Graeme White calls the book \\"brilliantly-crafted\\". Later career and television work Hoskins was one of the founders of the Exeter Group in 1960 (later to become the Exeter Civic Society). He was president of the Dartmoor Preservation Association from 1962 until 1976. He became the first professor of local history at the University of Leicester in 1965 when he was appointed Hatton Professor of English History. He retired in 1968. Following his retirement, Hoskins presented an episode of Horizon based on The Making of the English Landscape in 1972. This led to a BBC television series Landscapes of England which examined in more detail how human influence has greatly shaped the landscape of twelve distinct regions in England, the first series in 1976 and the second in 1978.Radio Times, Genome Project For the final episode, Hoskins talks passionately about his home county of Devon and his home city of Exeter. Honours and memorials Hoskins was awarded the Fellowship of the British Academy in 1969 and the CBE in 1971. He was made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1973, and received the Murchison Award of the Royal Geographical Society in 1976. The University of Exeter acknowledged his links with the city by conferring an honorary Doctorate of Letters upon him in 1974. As founder of the Department of English Local History (now the Centre for English Local History) at the University of Leicester, his achievements are commemorated by the Friends of the Centre for English Local History each year in the annual W. G. Hoskins lecture, and another at St Anne's College, Oxford. In 2004 the Devon History Society erected a blue plaque on his birthplace in Exeter with the inscription: \\"W. G.

Family Theodora was a daughter of the sebastokrat≈çr Isaac Komnenos by his second wife, Eirene Synadene. Her father was a son of Emperor John II Komnenos and Piroska of Hungary, daughter of King Ladislaus I of Hungary. Her paternal uncles included Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Her half-sister Maria Komnene married King Stephen IV of Hungary. Queen consort of Jerusalem Baldwin III of Jerusalem had taken control of the Kingdom of Jerusalem from his mother and Regent Queen Melisende in 1153. He was unmarried, however, and around 1157 it was decided by the Haute Cour that a wife should be sought from the Byzantine Empire, the kingdom's most powerful and wealthy neighbour. A Byzantine alliance would hopefully also bring much-needed money and military assistance against N≈´r al-Dƒ´n, sultan of Syria and Jerusalem's greatest enemy. Attard, archbishop of Nazareth, Humphrey II of Toron, constable of Jerusalem, Joscelin Piscellus, and William de Barris were sent to Constantinople to negotiate a marriage for the king (Attard died while on the mission). The ambassadors were delayed in Constantinople for almost an entire year but it was finally decided that Theodora would be chosen as Baldwin's wife. She was at the time only 12 or 13 years old, but was already renowned for her beauty. Her dowry was worth 100,000 hyperpyra, and William of Tyre estimated that her extravagant wedding clothes cost another 14,000 hyperpyra. As a dower from Baldwin, Theodora was granted the city of Acre, which she would hold as her own should Baldwin die childless. The ambassadors arrived in Jerusalem with Theodora in September 1158. Aimery of Limoges, the patriarch of Antioch, performed the marriage, as the patriarch of Jerusalem had not yet been consecrated. Baldwin was previously known for his frivolous lifestyle, but now became a devoted and loyal husband. The marriage was short and childless: Baldwin died only a few years later in 1162, leaving Theodora a widow at the age of about 17. Theodora received the city of Acre, as promised. Relationship with Andronikos I Komnenos A few years later in 1166, Theodora's kinsman Andronikos, a first cousin of her father, visited the kingdom and was named lord of Beirut by Baldwin's brother and successor Amalric I. Andronikos invited Theodora to Beirut, and the two eloped to Damascus, or as William says, Andronikos abducted her in collusion with N≈´r al-Dƒ´n. It was likely not an abduction; Andronikos was already married, and had already had an affair with Philippa, a sister of Prince Bohemund III of Antioch and of Manuel's wife Maria of Antioch, and he was likely trying to escape persecution by Manuel, who did not approve of these incestuous affairs. As there was no legal marriage, Acre was returned to King Amalric. Amalric had also married a Byzantine princess, Maria Komnene, and the imperial alliance remained intact. At the court of N≈´r al-Dƒ´n in Damascus, Andronikos and Theodora had two children together, Alexios and Eirene, although Andronikos was inevitably excommunicated. They also travelled to Baghdad, and then to the Sultanate of Rum where Andronikos was made lord of a castle in Paphlagonia. Some years later Theodora and her children were captured and handed over to the emperor Manuel, who kept them in Constantinople as a bait to encourage Andronikos to return to his Byzantine allegiance. He did in fact capitulate and visited Constantinople in 1180 to submit to Manuel. When he finally returned to Constantinople in 1182, becoming emperor in 1183, there is no evidence that Theodora went back to live with him. It was at this time, however, that their daughter Eirene married Alexios Komnenos, an illegitimate son of Emperor Manuel I by of Theodora Vatatzina. At this time, too, Theodora interceded with Andronikos to pay the ransom for her nephew, Isaac, a former Byzantine governor of Isauria now a captive in Armenia; Andronikos afterwards regretted doing so, since Isaac rebelled and seized control of Cyprus. K. Varzos suggests that Theodora Komnene and Theodora Vatatzina eventually conspired against Andronikos, but there seems to be no positive evidence of this. Her later history is not known. Namesakes Another Theodora Komnene was the wife of Prince Bohemund III of Antioch and sister of Queen Maria Komnene of Jerusalem. A third Theodora Komnene was the wife of Duke Henry II of Austria and mother of Duke Leopold V of Austria. Sources *William of Tyre, A History of Deeds Done Beyond the Sea, trans. E.A.

His paternal grandfather was a Georgian POW during WWII in France who escaped and subsequently participated in the French Resistance in the province of Limousin. Dimitri's brother Gr√©goire chose to play for the Georgian national team - whilst his maternal grandfather was an Armenian Genocide survivor. He began his club career at Gloucester Rugby where he was a replacement in the 2002 Zurich Championship Final (the year before winning the play-offs constituted winning the English title) in which Gloucester defeated Bristol Rugby. Yachvili made his international debut in November 2002 in a 35‚Äì3 victory against Canada. Since the retirement of Fabien Galthi√©, Yachvili was frequently part of the French starting 15. During the 2005 Six Nations Championship he gained his position as the first choice scrum-half for the French national team, cementing his position with a virtuoso goal-kicking performance against England at Twickenham. He also captained the French national team, surrendering the captaincy permanently for the 2005 summer tour to South Africa, which he missed through injury. He was considered the number two scrum-half behind Jean-Baptiste √âlissalde in the French team who retired in May 2010.http://www.breakingnews.ie/sport/?c=rugby&e;=examiner&jp;=kfcwaugbaucw He was second to Morgan Parra in the national selection as of the 2009 Six Nations.

Parachinar is situated on a neck of Pakistani territory west of Peshawar, that juts into the Logar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan. With a distance of from the Afghan capital Kabul, Parachinar is the closest point in Pakistan to Kabul. It is one of two urban areas in Kurram District, the other one being Sadda, and has shrank considerably in population over the past few decades, becoming the least populous urbanized area in Kohat Division. Its population is less than a third than it was at its peak in 1961.  History  The name Parachinar is derived as a result of social meetings conducted under a large chinar tree. The remains of that tree are still there at a place now encompassed by the headquarters of Kurram Agency where the elders of famous tribe chamkani residing in para area used to conclude meetings under a Chinar tree to resolve their social matters.  Durand Line Agreement  In 1893, during the rule of Ameer Abdur Rahman (Barakzai Dynasty) of Afghanistan, a Royal Commission for demarcating a Boundary between Afghanistan and the territory of British governed India negotiated terms, agreeing to the Durand line. Two parties camped at Parachinar, now part of FATA, Pakistan, which is near Khost, Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Sir Mortimer Durand and Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, Assistant Political Agent, Khyber Agency. The Afghanistan interest was represented by Sahibzada Abdul Latif and the Governor Khost Sardar Shireendil Khan, representing King Amir Abdur Rahman Khan.  2007 Kurram Agency conflict  On April 6, 2007, a gunman of Sunni sect fired upon a Friday prayer held by Shia in Parachinar, leaving more than 40 people dead and more than 150 people wounded. Violent clashes in the region occurred in the following week until a ceasefire was reached on April 12, 2007.  Terrorist incidents  Parachinar has been the target of several terrorist attacks since 2007 in which over 500 people have died, making it the second most targeted Pakistani city by militants after Peshawar.  Climate  Parachinar has a moderate humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfa). Although the city's southeasterly aspect relative to the valley in which it is situated allows it to receive on occasions significant monsoonal rainfall, the most frequent source of rain is western depressions and related thunderstorms. During the winter, snowfall is common, and frosts occur on most mornings. Snow closes the Peiwar Pass, located on the Paktia border just over 20 km west of Parachinar, for up to five months per year. Demographics The population of Parachinar is predominantly Shia Muslim. It is a small town of about 5,500 which has seen itself shrink considerably in population due to political strife caused by the Afghanistan Wars. It peaked in population in 1961, when it had over 22,000 people. Social issues As a result of many recent terrorist attacks, an estimated 60 percent of Parachinar residents suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder and approximately 40 percent of the population suffers from depression. A lack of mental health facilities in Kurram Agency has prevented many people in Parachinar from receiving treatment. Parachinar has a high suicide rate among young adults, and nearly 100 people commit suicide every year. Education FATA University plans to open a sub-campus at Parachinar. Transportation The Thall-Parachinar road is the main road connecting Parachinar to the rest of the country. Parachinar has an airport but currently it is non functional. In the past there was a flight service between Peshawar and Parachinar.

Its native range is eastern North America. Its scientific name honors Colonial Virginia botanist John Clayton (1694‚Äì1773). Description Springbeauty is a perennial plant, overwintering through a tuberous root. It is a trailing plant growing to long. The leaves are slender lanceolate, long and broad, with a long petiole. The flowers are in diameter with five pale pink or white (rarely yellow) petals, and reflect UV light. It has a raceme inflorescence, in which its flowers branch off of the shoot. The individual flowers bloom for three days, although the five stamens on each flower are only active for a single day. Flowering occurs between March and May depending on part of its range and weather. The seeds are between in diameter and a shiny black. The seeds are released from the capsule fruit when it breaks open. Elaiosomes are present on the seeds and allow for ant dispersal. It is a polyploid, having 2n between 12 and 191 chromosomes. The largest number of chromosomes was observed in New York City. Habitat and range Springbeauty is found in the Eastern temperate deciduous forest of North America. It is noted for its abundance throughout many parts of its range, especially in forests. The plant can be found throughout many different habitat types including lawns, city parks, forests, roadsides, wetlands, bluffs, and ravines. Hammond's yellow spring beauty Hammond's yellow spring beauty, Claytonia virginica var. hammondiae, is a varietal with a very small range and population in a few areas of Northwestern New Jersey. Uses This plant has been used medicinally by the Iroquois, who would give a cold infusion or decoction of the powdered roots to children suffering from convulsions. They would also eat the raw roots, believing that they permanently prevented conception. They would also eat the roots as food, as would the Algonquin people, who cooked them like potatoes. Spring beauty corms along with the entire above ground portion of the plant are safe for human consumption.

The name \\"330\\" refers to the approximate displacement of each single cylinder in cubic centimeters. The first, the 2+2 330 America, was a 250 GT/E with a larger 4.0 litre engine; the 330 GTC/GTS shared its chassis with the 275; the 330 GT 2+2 had its own chassis and bodywork; the mid-engined 330P racer was part of the Ferrari P series, produced in four models. Production ended in 1968 with the introduction of the Ferrari 365 series. All 330 models used an evolution of the 400 Superamerica's 4.0 L Colombo V12 engine. It was substantially changed, with wider bore spacing and an alternator replacing a generator. __TOC__ 330 America The 1963 330 America shared the outgoing 250 GT/E's chassis but not its engine, being powered by the new 4.0 L Tipo 209 V12, with at 6600 rpm. Visually, the 330 America was almost identical to the Series III 250 GT/E, although some were fitted with an \\"America\\" badge on the rear. Like the 250 GT/E, the 330 America was fitted with 185VR15 Pirelli Cinturato tyres. 50 330 Americas were built in late 1963 before being replaced by the larger 330 GT 2+2.Eaton (1982), p. 114 330 GT 2+2 The provisional 330 America was replaced in January 1964 by the new 330 GT 2+2. It was first shown at the Brussels Show, early that year. It was much more than a re- engined 250, however, with a sharper nose and tail, quad headlights, and a wide grille. Power output remained the same at . The wheelbase was longer, but Koni adjustable shock absorbers improved handling. A dual-circuit Dunlop braking system was used with discs all around, though it separated brakes front to back rather than diagonally as on modern systems. When leaving the factory the 330 GT originally fitted Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72). The 1965 Series II version featured a five-speed gearbox instead of the overdrive four-speed of the prior year. Other changes included the switch back to a dual-light instead of quad-light front, alloy wheels, and the addition of optional air conditioning and power steering. Prior to the introduction of the 'Series II' 330 GTs, a series of 125 'interim' cars were produced, with the quad-headlight external configuration of the Series I cars, but with the five- speed transmission and 'suspended' foot pedals of the 'Series II' cars. 625 Series I (including 125 'interim' cars) and 455 Series II 330 GT 2+2 cars had been built when the car was replaced by the 365 GT 2+2 in 1967. Production of the smaller 330 GTC and GTS models overlapped with the GT 2+2 for more than a year. 330 GTC/GTS The 330 GTC and 330 GTS were more like their 275 counterparts than the 330 GT 2+2. They shared the short wheelbase of the 275 as well as its independent rear suspension & the same tyres 205VR14 Michelin XWX. These models were more refined than earlier Ferraris, quieter and easier to drive. It has been stated that this \\"was probably the first Ferrari in which you could actually enjoy a radio\\".Eaton (1982), p. 116 The GTC berlinetta was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in March, 1966. It was a two-seater coup√© with a Pininfarina-designed body. The GTS spider was introduced later, at the October 1966 Paris Motor Show . It used the same chassis and drivetrain as the GTC. About 600 coup√©s and 100 spiders were produced before the 1968 introduction of the 365 GTC and GTS. Both models' four litre engines produced .  Special versions  A 1967 330 GTC was given one-off bodywork by Zagato at the behest of American importer Luigi Chinetti in 1974. This car's targa top bodywork led it to be called the \\"Zagato Convertible.\\" It was exhibited at the 1974 Geneva International Motor Show. Four 330 GTC Speciale coup√©s were constructed by Pininfarina in 1966. These used the 330 GTC chassis and drivetrain, with unique bodywork incorporating styling from the 365 California and other Pininfarina-designed Ferraris. This model was introduced at the 1967 Brussels Motor Show. Original customers included Princess Liliane de R√©thy of Belgium and Maria Maddalena da Lisca, wife of Pietro Barilla. In the early 1970s, Ferrari allowed Swiss specialist Felber to use the Ferrari name on a retro roadster using 330 GTC underpinnings. Six or seven examples of the Felber FF were built between 1974 and 1977, with hand-made aluminium bodywork by Panther Westwinds, who helped develop the car.

This model is also known as the 330 LM. First presented in March 1963 alongside the mid-engined 250 P, they were essentially a development of the 250 GTOs and fitted with the 4-litre 330 engine, here rated at at 7,500 rpm. Although the front is visually similar to the 250 GTOs, the main structure came from the 250 Lusso. The four 330 LMBs are distinct from the three 1962 330 GTOs; the 330 LMB chassis and body differed significantly from the 330 GTO, which was almost identical to the 250 GTO. The wheelbase, at , was also 20 mm longer than either the Lusso's or the GTO's. The raised plates on the top of the rear fenders were necessary to clear the rear tires. The 330 LMB did not see much racing, as Ferrari was moving over to the mid-engined layout for racing. One retired at Sebring 1963, while of three starters at Le Mans that year, two retired and the car of Jack Sears and Mike Salmon came in fifth. After this, the LMB saw no more works entries.Eaton (1982), p. 93 330 P Ferrari 330 P3-derived 412 P #0844 Four models of mid-engined racing cars used the 330 engine and name as well -- the 330 P/P2/P3/P4 range of the mid 1960s. The 330 P4 had 450 hp at 8000 rpm, which combined with its low weight of 792 kg (1746,06 lb) resulted in a top speed of 320 km/h (198.85 mph).

Simpson is the originator of the term and concept metrosexual. He has been described by one critic as \\"the skinhead Oscar Wilde\\".Philip Hensher , The Independent: \\"Mark Simpson is a skinhead Oscar Wilde, his bon mots are both alarming and amusing, getting up people's noses and inside their trousers with equal aplomb.\\"; quote used to promote Simpson's books \\"Sex Terror\\" and \\"The Queen is Dead\\" Simpson has written for numerous publications around the world, including The Times, The Guardian, Salon, Arena Homme +, GQ Style, Vogues Hommes International, The Independent on Sunday, T√™tu, the Seattle Stranger, and Dutch Playboy. In December 2007, GQ Russia placed him in their 'Top Ten Things That Changed Men's Lives'. The term metrosexual Mark Simpson is credited with coining the term metrosexual in a 1994 article for The Independent.Here come the mirror men , MarkSimpson.com He also introduced the word to the US in 'Meet the Metrosexual', a much-quoted essay on Salon.com in 2002, leading to the global popularity of the term. This was also the first citation of the UK footballer David Beckham as the ultimate example of the type. Simpson was later credited with introducing the term 'retrosexual' (in the sense of the anti-metrosexual) in 2003. Described as one of the \\"Ideas of the Year\\" by The New York Times in 2006, Simpson wrote on the issue of sport and advertising increasingly using homoerotic imagery, in a process he dubbed \\"sporno\\" (\\"the place where sport and porn meet and produce a gigantic money shot\\"). Simpson wrote about \\"sporno\\" for Out magazine commenting that: \\"whole new generation of young bucks, from twinky soccer players like Manchester United's Alan Smith and Cristiano Ronaldo to rougher prospects like Chelsea's Joe Cole and AC Milan's Kak', keen to emulate their success, are actively pursuing sex-object status in a postmetrosexual, increasingly pornolized world.\\" The London Times newspaper also featured sporno in their 'Year in Ideas' list. In 2010, the global trend spotting website Science of the Time described Simpson as \\"the world's most perceptive writer about masculinity\\". The Times of India included 'metrosexual' in their review of the most important words of the last thirty years, commenting: \\"Much has been written about metrosexuals, but no one has done it as well as the man credited with coining the term, Mark Simpson.\\" In 2014, Simpson proposed that the age of the metrosexual has passed and is evolving into a new kind of man called the spornosexual. Spornosexual is a neologism, also coined by Simpson, combining the words \\"sport,\\" \\"porn,\\" and \\"metrosexual.\\" It describes an aesthetic adopted by some men who consume both sports and pornography. Such men, in addition to possessing certain metrosexual attributes, carry their own bodies as accessories and are not shy at showcasing them in public. The spornosexual style emphasises heavy, lean musculature, and certain kinds of tattooing. Spornosexuals spend much money and time on physical fitness and upkeep. Some commentators argue that the rise of spornosexuals is another indication of society becoming evermore narcissistic.  Books = Male Impersonators  Simpson's first book Male Impersonators (1994) provided the background for his theory of metrosexuality by examining the way men were represented in popular culture ‚Äì movies, ads, mags, music, male stripping, and comedy ‚Äì and showing how 'unmanly' passions such as homoeroticism, male narcissism, and male masochism were not excluded but rather exploited, albeit semi-secretly, in voyeuristic virility. Returning to Freud's theory of universal bisexual responsiveness, Simpson also 'outed' what he saw as the homoerotic subtext of masculinity itself. In particular, Simpson analysed the way movies, ads, pop music, and bodybuilding, had replaced 'real' masculinity, if it ever existed, with something 'sexy and simulated'. In his chapter on Marky Mark and his (then) recent Calvin Klein ads, Simpson argued that the rapper's appearance on billboards in Times Square and on the side of buses 'in his prime and in his underwear', grabbing his 'package' to shift product, graphically demonstrated how the commodification of the male body ‚Äì 'and gay men's love for it' ‚Äì had become 'eyepoppingly' mainstream. The book included a chapter arguing that the real romance in Top Gun was between Maverick (Tom Cruise) and Iceman (Val Kilmer). Quentin Tarantino made a cameo appearance in the film Sleep with Me later the same year as a party-guest making a similar argument.  Anti-Gay  Simpson's collection Anti-Gay (1996), described on the jacket as \\"the shameful antidote to feelgood politics\\"', according to The Independent, \\"divided the gay community\\". Led by Simpson, various 'non-heterosexual' contributors, such as Bruce LaBruce and Glenn Belverio, John Weir, Peter Tatchell, Lisa Power, and Anne-Marie Le Ble, voiced their criticism of the gay \\"one-size-fits-all\\" identity and the gay media's intolerance of anything that wasn't \\"glad\\" and \\"clap happy\\". Anti-Gay was one of the first \\"post-gay\\" books, appearing a year or so before a series of largely conservative American gay books critical of gay culture, such as The Rise and Fall of Gay Culture (D Harris, 1997) and Life Outside (M Signorile, 1997), Sexual Ecology (G Rotello, 1998).  It's a Queer World  It's a Queer World published the same year, described on the dust jacket as \\"hilariously perverse\\" and \\"taking a warped look at fin-de- siecle pop culture where nothing is as straight ‚Äì or gay ‚Äì as it seems\\", collected Simpson's popular columns of the same name which appeared in Attitude magazine, and showed how gay and straight culture were converging, a decade before this became a common theme.  The Queen is Dead  The Queen is Dead (1998) collected his colourful and confessional correspondence with American writer Steven Zeeland. According to the jacket blurb: \\"A chance letter sparks off an hilariously doomed transatlantic literary romance involving Marines, glory holes, cats, intellectuals, transsexuals and a bizarre love-triangle rivalry with gay serial-killer and Gianni Versace's assassin Andrew Cunanan.\\" Despite its openly offbeat subject matter, it was reviewed positively: \\"Something of a masterpiece\\" wrote Roger Clarke in The Independent. Sex Terror Sex Terror: Misadventures in pop culture is a collection of essays, interviews and articles from Simpson's late 1990s journalism, including writings in Attitude magazine and The Guardian. Interview subjects include Henry Rollins, Julie Burchill and Dana International. Saint Morrissey Saint Morrissey was Simpson's \\"psycho- bio\\" of the former Smiths front man, written at a low point of the singer's career, and published the year before Morrissey's 2004 comeback. The book prompted some comparisons with the subject's style: \\"Simpson is funny, clever, honest, irreverent and egotistical: quite the match for Morrissey. More biographies should be written this way.\\" (Laurence Phelan, Independent on Sunday Books of the Year') Metrosexy Simpson's ebook, Metrosexy (2011), collects his writings on the subject of metrosexuality, offering a kind of biography of the subject, which he describes as a \\"Frankenstein monster with flawless skin\\". The book follows the term from its origin in an article of Simpson's for The Independent newspaper in 1994, to its international adoption in the early 2000s, the backlash against it and its subsequent Jersey Shore resurgence, to the point where Simpson argues that metrosexuality had come to be seen as simply \\"normal\\".

A survey of what it described as pseudosciences and cult beliefs, it became a founding document in the nascent scientific skepticism movement. Michael Shermer said of it: \\"Modern skepticism has developed into a science-based movement, beginning with Martin Gardner's 1952 classic\\". The book debunks what it characterises as pseudo-science and the pseudo-scientists who propagate it. Contents=Synopsis Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science starts with a brief survey of the spread of the ideas of \\"cranks\\" and \\"pseudo-scientists\\", attacking the credulity of the popular press and the irresponsibility of publishing houses in helping to propagate these ideas. Cranks often cite historical cases where ideas were rejected which are now accepted as right. Gardner acknowledges that such cases occurred, and describes some of them, but says that times have changed: \\"If anything, scientific journals err on the side of permitting questionable theses to be published\\". Gardner acknowledges that \\"among older scientists ... one may occasionally meet with irrational prejudice against a new point of view\\", but adds that \\"a certain degree of dogma ... is both necessary and desirable\\" because otherwise \\"science would be reduced to shambles by having to examine every new-fangled notion that came along.\\" Gardner says that cranks have two common characteristics. The first \\"and most important\\" is that they work in almost total isolation from the scientific community. Gardner defines the community as an efficient network of communication within scientific fields, together with a co-operative process of testing new theories. This process allows for apparently bizarre theories to be published ‚Äî such as Einstein's theory of relativity, which initially met with considerable opposition; it was never dismissed as the work of a crackpot, and it soon met with almost universal acceptance. pp. 8-9 But the crank \\"stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. He does not send his findings to the recognized journals or, if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent.\\" The second characteristic of the crank (which also contributes to his or her isolation) is the tendency to paranoia. There are five ways in which this tendency is likely to be manifested. #The pseudo-scientist considers himself a genius. #He regards other researchers as stupid, dishonest or both. #He believes there is a campaign against his ideas, a campaign comparable to the persecution of Galileo or Pasteur. He may attribute his \\"persecution\\" to a conspiracy by a scientific \\"masonry\\" who are unwilling to admit anyone to their inner sanctum without appropriate initiation. #Instead of side-stepping the mainstream, the pseudo-scientist attacks it head-on: The most revered scientist is Einstein so Gardner writes that Einstein is the most likely establishment figure to be attacked. #He has a tendency to use complex jargon, often making up words and phrases. Gardner compares this to the way that schizophrenics talk in what psychiatrists call \\"neologisms\\", \\"words which have meaning to the patient, but sound like Jabberwocky to everyone else.\\" pp 13-14 These psychological traits are in varying degrees demonstrated throughout the remaining chapters of the book, in which Gardner examines particular \\"fads\\" he labels pseudo-scientific. His writing became the source book from which many later studies of pseudo-science were taken (e.g. Encyclopedia of Pseudo-science).

P. Putnam's Sons in 1952. The subtitle boldly states the book's theme: \\"The curious theories of modern pseudoscientists and the strange, amusing and alarming cults that surround them. A study in human gullibility\\". As of 2005, it had been reprinted at least 30 times. The book was expanded from an article first published in the Antioch Review in 1950, and in the preface to the first edition, Gardner thanks the Review for allowing him to develop the article as the starting point of his book. p. viii Not all material in the article is carried over to the book. For example, in the article, Gardner writes: > The reader may wonder why a competent scientist does not publish a detailed > refutation of Reich's absurd biological speculations. The answer is that the > informed scientist doesn't care, and would, in fact, damage his reputation > by taking the time to undertake such a thankless task. p. 456 And comments in a footnote: > It is not within the scope of this paper, however, to discuss technical > criteria by which hypotheses are given high, low, or negative degrees of > confirmation. Our purpose is simply to glance at several examples of a type > of scientific activity which fails completely to conform to scientific > standards, but at the same time is the result of such intricate mental > activity that it wins temporary acceptance by many laymen insufficiently > informed to recognize the scientist's incompetence. Although there obviously > is no sharp line separating competent from incompetent research, and there > are occasions when a scientific \\"orthodoxy\\" may delay the acceptance of > novel views, the fact remains that the distance between the work of > competent scientists and the speculations of a Voliva or Velikovsky is so > great that a qualitative difference emerges which justifies the label of > \\"pseudo-science.\\" Since the time of Galileo the history of pseudo-science > has been so completely outside the history of science that the two streams > touch only in the rarest of instances. p. 456, n.4 While in the book, Gardner writes: > If someone announces that the moon is made of green cheese, the professional > astronomer cannot be expected to climb down from his telescope and write a > detailed refutation. ‚ÄúA fairly complete textbook of physics would be only > part of the answer to Velikovsky,‚Äù writes Prof. Laurence J. Lafleur, in his > excellent article on ‚ÄúCranks and Scientists‚Äù (Scientific Monthly, Nov., > 1951), ‚Äúand it is therefore not surprising that the scientist does not find > the undertaking worth while.‚Äù p. 11 And in the wrap-up of the chapter: > Just as an experienced doctor is able to diagnose certain ailments the > instant a new patient walks into his office, or a police officer learns to > recognize criminal types from subtle behavior clues which escape the > untrained eye, so we, perhaps, may learn to recognize the future scientific > crank when we first encounter him. p. 15 Reception A contemporary review in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette particularly welcomed Gardner's critical remarks about Hoxsey Therapy and about Krebiozen, both of which were being advanced as anti-cancer measures at that time. The review concluded that the book \\"should help to counteract some amusing and some positively harmful cults, the existence of which is all too often promoted by irresponsible journalism.\\" The work has often been mentioned in subsequent books and articles. Louis Lasagna, in his book The Doctors' Dilemmas, considered it to be a \\"superb account of scientific cults, fads, and frauds\\" and wrote that \\"This talented writer combines solid fact with a pleasing style.\\" Sociologist of religion Anson D. Shupe took in general a positive attitude, and praises Gardner for his humor. But he says > If there is a single criticism to be made of Gardner ... it is that he > accepts too comfortably the conventional wisdom, or accepted social reality, > of current twentieth-century science and middle-class American Christianity. > Somehow it is evident (to me at least) that he is implicitly making a pact > with the reader to evaluate these fringe groups in terms of their own shared > presumptions about what is \\"normal\\". Thus he is quite confident throwing > around labels like \\"quack\\", \\"crank\\" and \\"preposterous\\". In science the use > of such value judgments can be quite time-bound; likewise in religions where > today's heresy may become tomorrow's orthodoxy. The odds of course are > always on the side of the writer criticizing fringe groups because > statistically speaking so few of them survive. However, when a group does > weather its infancy and go on to prosper, invariably its original detractors > look a bit more arbitrary than they did initially, and then the shoe is on > the other foot. In the 1980s a fierce interchange took place between Gardner and Colin Wilson. In The Quest for Wilhelm Reich Wilson wrote of this book > (Gardner) writes about various kinds of cranks with the conscious > superiority of the scientist, and in most cases one can share his sense of > the victory of reason. But after half a dozen chapters this non-stop > superiority begins to irritate; you begin to wonder about the standards that > make him so certain he is always right. He asserts that the scientist, > unlike the crank, does his best to remain open-minded. So how can he be so > sure that no sane person has ever seen a flying saucer, or used a dowsing > rod to locate water? And that all the people he disagrees with are > unbalanced fanatics? A colleague of the positivist philosopher A. J. Ayer > once remarked wryly \\"I wish I was as certain of anything as he seems to be > about everything\\". Martin Gardner produces the same feeling. By Wilson's own account, up to that time he and Gardner had been friends, but Gardner took offence.letter, New York Review of Books, June 15, 1989 In February 1989 Gardner wrote a letter published in The New York Review of Books describing Wilson as \\"England‚Äôs leading journalist of the occult, and a firm believer in ghosts, poltergeists, levitations, dowsing, PK (psychokinesis), ESP, and every other aspect of the psychic scene\\".letter, New York Review of Books, February 16, 1989 Shortly afterwards, Wilson replied, defending himself and adding \\"What strikes me as so interesting is that when Mr. Gardner‚Äîand his colleagues of CSICOP‚Äîbegin to denounce the 'Yahoos of the paranormal,' they manage to generate an atmosphere of such intense hysteria ...\\". Gardner in turn replied quoting his own earlier description of Wilson: \\"The former boy wonder, tall and handsome in his turtleneck sweater, has now decayed into one of those amiable eccentrics for which the land of Conan Doyle is noted. They prowl comically about the lunatic fringes of science ...\\" In a review of a subsequent Gardner work, Paul Stuewe of the Toronto Star called Fads and Fallacies a \\"hugely enjoyable demolition of pseudo-scientific nonsense\\". Ed Regis, writing in The New York Times, considered the book to be \\"the classic put-down of pseudoscience\\". Fellow skeptic Michael Shermer called the book \\"the skeptic classic of the past half-century.\\" He noted that the mark of popularity for the book came when John W. Campbell denounced the chapter on dianetics over the radio. Mark Erickson, author of Science, culture and society: understanding science in the twenty-first century, noted that Gardner's book provided \\"a flavour of the immense optimism surrounding science in the 1950s\\" and that his choice of topics were \\"interesting\\", but also that his attacks on \\"osteopathy, chiropractice, and the Bates method for correcting eyesight would raise eyebrows amongst medical practitioners today\\". Gardner‚Äôs own response to criticism is given in his preface: :The first edition of this book prompted many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt the same about orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky ‚Äúpitied‚Äù me because I had turned my spine on God‚Äôs greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent. preface See also * Fads and Fallacies in the Social Sciences * Survivorship bias * The Demon-Haunted World NotesReferences * * Category:Works by Martin Gardner Category:1952 non-fiction books Category:1957 non-fiction books Category:Books critical of Scientology Category:Science books Category:Scientific skepticism mass media ","title":"Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science"},{"id":"1878394","text":"Dare Wright (December 3, 1914 ‚Äì January 25, 2001) was a Canadian‚ÄìAmerican children's author, model, and photographer. She is best known for her 1957 children's book, The Lonely Doll. Early life Wright was born in the Thornhill section of Vaughan, Ontario, Canada, but spent her childhood in the United States, growing up in Cleveland, Ohio. Her parents divorced when she was young, and she was raised by her mother, the portrait artist Edith Stevenson Wright, while her brother, Blaine, went to live with his father, Ivan Wright, a theater critic in New York City. The siblings did not meet again until Dare moved to New York City in her twenties. Wright spent her formative years in Cleveland Heights. Wright graduated from Laurel School in Shaker Heights in 1933 at the top of her class, and relocated to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. In 1935, she was cast in a small role as a maid in a stage production of Pride and Prejudice, which she performed in Washington, D.C. and on Broadway. Career In 1957, she photographed her childhood Lenci doll, Edith, along with two teddy bears bought at FAO Schwarz, for her first children's book, titled The Lonely Doll. The book made The New York Times Best Seller list for children's books. In November 2010, The British Newspaper The Guardian named The Lonely Doll one of the 10 Best Illustrated Children's Books of all time. It was followed by eighteen other stories. Out of print for many years, it was reissued in 1998, introducing Wright to a new generation of readers. Another children's work, Lona: A Fairy Tale, features photographs of Wright herself dressed as a fairy princess, while using another doll in identical costume to give the illusion that Wright's character has been \\"transformed\\" to doll-size by a wicked wizard. Make Me Real, which features another of Wright's childhood dolls, and Ocracoke in The Fifties, her only book written for adults, have been published posthumously. Dare Wright's photographs were exhibited for the first time in 2012 by Fred Torres Collaborations. Personal life Throughout her adulthood, Wright remained close to her mother and never married despite receiving a number of proposals. Her brother, to whom she also was very attached, was estranged from their mother. Her mother died in 1975 and her brother in 1985. She was admitted to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island in May 1995 after suffering respiratory failure. She remained hospitalized for the next five and a half years until she died on January 25, 2001 at the age of 86. Bibliography=Books still in print * The Lonely Doll.

Pinkney was often said to be the last surviving original member of The Drifters, who achieved international fame with numerous hit records. He was chiefly responsible for its early sounds. The Drifters have had a strong influence on soul, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll music. As an original group member, Bill Pinkney was a 1988 inductee into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame with The Drifters . Early life Born Willie Pinkney in Dalzell, South Carolina, Pinkney grew up singing his favorite music, gospel, in his church choir. He was raised in a Christian home, and at an early age accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior joining Mount Olive AME Church. He served in the United States Army in World War II. He earned a Presidential Citation with five service stars (for battles including Normandy and Bastogne under General Patton). Returning from the war, Pinkney began to sing again in various gospel choirs. There he met and joined with the men who became the original members of the Drifters. The Drifters Bill Pinkney, brothers Andrew and Gerhart Thrasher, and bass singer Willie Ferbie were approached by Clyde McPhatter, who had just quit as the lead tenor of the popular R&B; group, Billy Ward & the Dominoes. McPhatter proposed they create a new group to record for Atlantic Records. On their first record, \\"Money Honey\\", Pinkney, a natural bass-baritone with a multi-octave range, actually sang first tenor. After Ferbie left, Pinkney switched to the bass part, in which he was heard on \\"Honey Love,\\" \\"White Christmas\\", \\"Adorable\\", \\"Ruby Baby\\", and many other early Drifters recordings. In 1954, the Drifters recorded their version of \\"White Christmas\\" by Irving Berlin. That version was featured in the 1990 movie Home Alone,Los Angeles Times, \\"Bill Pinkney, 81; last original member of the Drifters vocal group\\" July 6, 2007 as well as the 1994 movie \\"The Santa Clause.\\" Pinkney can also be heard singing lead on the 1956 recording \\"I Should Have Done Right\\" and 1955's \\"Steamboat\\". Pinkney was in and out of the group from 1956 through 1958. He did not participate in the recording of later hits like \\"Fools Fall in Love\\" and \\"Drip Drop\\", which featured bass singer Tommy Evans. After Pinkney's permanent departure, The Drifters recorded hit classics such as \\"Under the Boardwalk\\", \\"Save the Last Dance for Me\\", \\"There Goes My Baby\\", \\"Up on the Roof\\", and \\"On Broadway\\", with a completely new line-up. Solo career and reformation of The Drifters In 1958, George Treadwell, the group manager fired all of the individual Drifters and hired all new singers, The Crowns (formally known as the Five Crowns), signing them under the Drifters' name. Pinkney was forced to leave. Pinkney quickly created a group called the Original Drifters, made up of key members of the first (1953‚Äì58) association. Pinkney's Original Drifters was consistently popular throughout the southeastern United States. For decades their music was a staple of the \\"beach music\\" scene. Leaders such as President Bill Clinton and President Nelson Mandela of South Africa recognized Pinkney's contributions. Pinkney received many musical awards, including the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award, and was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, United Group Harmony Association, and the Beach Music Hall of Fame. He was selected for the South Carolina Black Hall of Fame and given a \\"key to the state\\", which proclaimed May 14 as Bill Pinkney Day. The cities of Sumter, Bamberg, and Myrtle Beach (all South Carolina), each presented its \\"key to the city\\" to Pinkney. He was honored by the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. In 2002, Pinkney received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Music from Coastal Carolina University. Death Pinkney died on July 4, 2007 in Daytona Beach, Florida from a heart attack, while staying at the Daytona Beach Hilton. Funeral services were held on July 9, 2007 at the Sumter County Exhibition Center in Sumter, South Carolina. Pinkney was buried at St. Luke's AME Church in Sumter.

It is patterned somewhat after the United Nations Security Council. The PSC is also the main pillar of the African Peace and Security Architecture (APSA), and works with other pillars of the APSA in order to promote \\"peace, security and stability in Africa\\". The specific goal of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) is the \\"prevention, management and resolution of conflicts\\". To achieve these goals, it involves subsidiary organizations such as the Military Staff Committee and the Committee of Experts. Members are elected by the African Union Executive Council and endorsed by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within Africa, as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at Addis Ababa. The council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms. Countries are immediately re-eligible upon the expiration of their terms.  History = Background  In the early 1990s, members of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the predecessor to the African Union (AU), decided to abstain from active peacekeeping operations and focus instead on \\"preventive diplomacy\\". However, they reevaluated their stances after conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi. In 1995, members of the OAU started to support the use of peacekeeping operations after a summit in Addis Ababa. However, the OAU still prioritized preventive diplomacy and believed that the United Nations should shoulder most of the responsibility for organizing peacekeeping operations. Later conflicts in Africa were largely mediated by African institutions rather than the UN. For example, conflicts in Liberia and Sierra Leone were addressed by the Economic Community of West African States. Similarly, conflicts in Lesotho and the Democratic Republic of Congo were addressed by the Southern African Development Community. These sub- regional organizations' large role in addressing regional conflicts led to a debate about the effectiveness of the OAU. Members specifically wished to reform the OAU's focus on consensus-based meetings rather than on-the-ground action, since some conflicts' actors were part of the meetings and could interfere with their judgement. Similarly, the large size of the OAU, its consensus decision-making and its lack of clear procedures both obstructed constructive debate. However, on-the-ground interventions were also limited by the OAU's non-interventionist principles, which only allowed domestic military intervention with the state's consent. Thus, in 2001, an OAU Assembly session moved to reform the OAU's mechanisms in a new institution: the African Union. The new African Union was designed to center around a central decision-making organ with concrete rules, a smaller membership of 15 states to facilitate decision-making, majority rather than consensus-based decision-making, and viable options to recommend military intervention to the African Union Assembly. After some debate, this decision-making organ was coined the Peace and Security Council, and its rules were outlined in the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council.  Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council  Adopted in July 2002, the Protocol was later ratified by a majority of AU members in December 2003. Within the Protocol's text, the institutional design, subsidiary committees, powers and goals of the PSC were outlined. Specifically, its Objectives were stated in Article 3, and its Principles were stated in Article 4. When outlining its Principles, the Protocol cites three inspirations: \\"the [AU's] Constitutive Act, the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\". In Article 5, the Protocol details the PSC's membership structure and membership criteria. Article 8 outlines the PSC's procedural rules, including rules for voting, organizing meetings and creating subsidiary bodies. Specific subcommittees that support the PSC, such as the Panel of the Wise, the Continental Early Warning System, and the African Standby Force are detailed in Articles 11, 12 and 13, respectively. Finally, the Protocol outlines the PSC's relationship with regional bodies in Article 16, and relationship with international organizations, especially the UN, in Article 17.  Organization = Meetings  There are three levels of PSC meetings: meetings between permanent representatives, meetings between ministers, and meetings between heads of state. Permanent representative meetings meet at least twice a month, whereas the other two levels meet at least once per year. Until 2007, there were three types of meetings: formal meetings, briefing sessions and consultations. In formal meetings, members discuss AU Commission reports, which often concern brewing conflicts. In briefing sessions, PSC staff briefs members on various subject areas and themes, such as terrorism and development. In consultation meetings, PSC members work to gather various actors and develop an understanding of a certain issue. After a brainstorming session in July of 2007, the PSC instead chose to meet under four types of meetings: public meetings, closed meetings, consultations and \\"Arria-type\\" meetings. In \\"Arria-type\\" meetings, PSC members meet with non-state actors and carry out informal discussions. As of 2016, the PSC has held over 600 meetings.  Chairperson of the Commission  Every month, a new chairperson is selected from the PSC members. This selection cycles through the alphabetical order of the PSC's member country names, in English. Members Although the PSC was partly inspired by the United Nations Security Council, unlike the UNSC, the PSC does not have any permanent members or veto power. All 15 members have equal power in the Council. Ten members are elected for two years and five members are elected for three years. Members are elected to represent Africa's regional distribution. In order, each potential member must meet certain criteria. These criteria are outlined in Article five of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council. As of November 2018, the following countries occupy the seats of the PSC:African Union, Peace and Security Department, Composition of the PSC , accessed 23 February 2019 { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" !Term ! colspan=\\"3\\" Central Africa ! colspan=\\"3\\" Eastern Africa ! colspan=\\"2\\" Northern Africa ! colspan=\\"3\\" Southern Africa ! colspan=\\"4\\" Western Africa - !2017  rowspan=\\"3\\" colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"3\\" colspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  - !2018 - !2019  rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\" rowspan=\\"2\\"  - !2020  }  Role = Mission  The mission of the PSC is to respond to conflicts in Africa. The PSC relies on collective security and its early warning detection systems. Article 3 of the Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council expands upon the PSC's objectives.  Powers  Article 7 of the Protocol Relating to the Establishment of the Peace and Security Council lists the PSC's power. Some of these powers include undertaking \\"peace-making and peace-building functions to resolve conflicts\\", recommending intervention to the AU Assembly in \\"grave circumstances, namely war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity\\", promoting a close relationship with regional bodies as well as with the United Nations, facilitating humanitarian action and finally, deciding \\"on any other issue having implications for the maintenance of peace, security and stability on the Continent\\".  Peace Support Missions  The following peace support operations have been conducted under an AU mandate, or with AU authorisation. (1) African Union Mission in Burundi (AMIB) - 2003 to 2004 AU mandated 2 April 2003 (for a period of 12 months); deployed 27 April 2003 to 31 May 2004 when the mission was succeeded by a UN mission. The Head of Mission and Special Representative of the Chairperson of the AU Commission was Ambassador Mamadou Bah (Guinea). The Force Commander of AMIB‚Äôs military component was Major-General Sipho Binda (South Africa), while his deputy, Brigadier-General G. Ayele, was from Ethiopia. (2) African Union Mission in Sudan (AMIS) ‚Äì 2004 to 2007 (3) African Union Military Observer Mission in the Comoros (MIOC) - 2004 (4) African Union Mission for Support to the Elections in Comoros (AMISEC) ‚Äì 2006 (5) African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) ‚Äì 2007 to present On 20 February 2007 the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 1744, which authorised AMISOM‚Äôs deployment. (6) African Union Electoral and Security Assistance Mission to the Comoros (MAES) ‚Äì 2007 to 2008 (7) African Union/ United Nations Hybrid Mission (UNAMID) - 2008 to present On 31 July 2007 UN Security Council Resolution 1769 (UNSC 2007) established the AU/ UN Hybrid Operation in Darfur, also referred to as UNAMID. (8) Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the Lord‚Äôs Resistance Army (RCI-LRA) - 2011 to 2017 Authorised by the AU Peace and Security Council in November 2011. (9) African-led International Support Mission to Mali (AFISMA) ‚Äì 2013 (10) African-led Support Mission to the Central African Republic (MISCA) ‚Äì 2013 to 2014 A regional peace support mission - the Mission for the consolidation of peace in Central African Republic (MICOPAX) - was deployed in 2008 under the leadership of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS). But a new crisis erupted in 2012-2013, when S√©l√©ka forces seized the capital Bangui. In response, on 19 July 2013, the AU Peace and Security Council approved the deployment of MISCA. The transfer of authority between ECCAS/MICOPAX and the AU/MISCA mission took place on 19 December 2013. The mission ended with the transfer of authority from MISCA to the UN mission MINUSCA on 15 September 2014.African Union, Peace and Security Council, https://au.int/en/organs/psc, accessed 31 January 2018. (11) Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF) ‚Äì 2015 to present (12) Regional Protection Force - 2017 to present During July 2016 the AU agreed to a Regional Protection Force to bolster the UN mission in South Sudan, similar to the United Nations Force Intervention Brigade role with the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the CongoAglietti, S. (2016) 'AU Agrees to Send Troops to South Sudan', The Citizen (Dar-es-Salaam), 20 July 2016. UN Security Council resolution 2304 adopted on 12 August 2016 approved the deployment of a Regional Protection Force to the UN Mission in South Sudan to provide a secure environment in and around Juba. Rwandan troops deployed during 2017 as part of the proposed force,'Rwanda deploys Mechanised Infantry battalion to South Sudan under Regional Protection Force', Rwanda Ministry of Defence website, 31 July 2017, but there has been little subsequent news of this force and it appears it may have been merely absorbed into the larger UN mission. It included a Bangladeshi engineer company and a Nepalese company in addition to a Rwandan mechanised infantry battalion, so cannot be said to be an African force. During December 2015 the Peace and Security Council authorised a force of up to 5000 troops to be deployed to Burundi for six months to help restore order in that country following an outbreak of politically-inspired violence. However, the African Prevention and Protection Mission in Burundi (MAPROBU) was not welcomed by the Government of Burundi and never deployed to the troubled country.Karuhanga, J. (2015) 'What Next After AU Authorizes Deployment of African Force in Burundi?', The New Times (Kigali), 20 December 2015.  Criticism  Some AU members criticized the PSC Protocol for being vague on which institution has the \\"primary legal authority\\" to use military force; in Article 16, the PSC Protocol states that the AU has \\"the primary responsibility for promoting peace, security and stability in Africa\\" whereas in Article 17, the Protocol states that the UN Security Council \\"has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\\". Ben Kioko, the African Union's legal adviser, argued that \\"[some African] leaders have shown themselves willing to push the frontiers of collective stability and security to the limit without any regard for legal niceties such as the authorization of the [United Nations] Security Council\\". Later in 2005, African Union members acknowledged the Security Council's authority on military use, as demonstrated in a meeting roadmap which promised that the AU would first get Security Council authorization before carrying out military interventions. Some officials within the PSC have also argued that the PSC should broaden its scope beyond traditional military threats to security, and also address nontraditional threats such as disease and climate change. Conversely, others question the political will of PSC and AU members to follow the PSC protocol and carry out military interventions against other members without their consent in cases of mass human rights abuses. Furthermore, the PSC relies on regional bodies contributing funds or troops for operations, but many regional bodies do not have enough resources to meet these standards. When electing members into the PSC itself, critics have noted that members who were actively disobeying AU decisions or carrying out human rights violations within their borders have still been admitted into the Council because the Assembly of the African Union Heads of State did not properly evaluate the potential members' compliance to the PSC membership criteria.

An electric field will be induced normal to both. This effect is quantified by the Nernst coefficient N, which is defined to be ::N=\\\\frac{E_Y/B_Z}{dT/dx} where E_Y is the y-component of the electric field that results from the magnetic field's z-component B_Z and the temperature gradient dT/dx. The reverse process is known as the Ettingshausen effect and also as the second Nernst‚ÄìEttingshausen effect.  Physical picture  Mobile energy carriers (for example conduction-band electrons in a semiconductor) will move along temperature gradients due to statistics and the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. If there is a magnetic field transversal to the temperature gradient and the carriers are electrically charged, they experience a force perpendicular to their direction of motion (also the direction of the temperature gradient) and to the magnetic field. Thus, a perpendicular electric field is induced.  Sample types  Semiconductors exhibit the Nernst effect. This has been studied in the 1950s by Krylova, Mochan and many others. In metals however, it is almost non-existent. It appears in the vortex phase of type-II superconductors due to vortex motion. This has been studied by Huebener et al. High-temperature superconductors exhibit the Nernst effect both in the superconducting and in the pseudogap phase, as was first found by Xu et al. Heavy-Fermion superconductors can show a strong Nernst signal which is likely not due to the vortices, as was found by Bel et al.

Rising above the harbor, its name is said to refer to its resemblance to the traditional shape of concentrated refined loaf sugar. It is known worldwide for its cableway and panoramic views of the city and beyond. The mountain is one of several monolithic granite and quartz mountains that rise straight from the water's edge around Rio de Janeiro. Geologically, it is considered part of a family of steep-sided rock outcroppings known as non- inselberg bornhardts. The mountain is protected by the Sugarloaf Mountain and Urca Hill Natural Monument, created in 2006. This became part of a World Heritage Site declared by UNESCO in 2012. Origins of the name The name Sugarloaf was coined in the 16th century by the Portuguese during the heyday of sugarcane trade in Brazil. According to historian Vieira Fazenda, blocks of sugar were placed in conical molds made of clay to be transported on ships. The form of the peak reminded them of the well-known resulting \\"sugarloaf\\" shape, and the nickname has since been extended to be a general descriptor for formations of this kind. Cable car A glass-walled cable car (bondinho or, more formally, telef√©rico), capable of holding 65 people, runs along a route between the peaks of Sugarloaf and Morro da Urca every 20 minutes. The original cable car line was built in 1912 and rebuilt around 1972‚Äì73 and in 2008. The cable car goes from a ground station, at the base of Morro da Babil√¥nia, to Morro da Urca and thence to Sugarloaf's summit. Reaching the summit To reach the summit, passengers take two cable cars. The first ascends to the shorter Morro da Urca, high. The second car ascends to P√£o de A√ß√∫car.Lonely Planet: Rio de Janeiro, page 76, Ricardo Gomes, John Maier Jr et al., 2006, Lonely Planet Publications, The Swiss-made bubble-shaped cars offer passengers 360¬∞ views of the surrounding city. The ascent takes three minutes from start to finish. Timeline *1907 ‚Äì Brazilian engineer Augusto Ferreira Ramos had the idea of linking the hills through a path in the air. *1910 ‚Äì The same engineer founded the Society of Sugar Loaf and the same year the works were started. The project was commissioned in Germany and built by Brazilian workers. All parts were taken by climbing mountains or lifted by steel cables. *1912 ‚Äì Opening of the tram, first lift of Brazil: The first cable cars were made of coated wood and were used for 61 years. *1973 ‚Äì The current models of cars were put into operation. This increased the carrying capacity by almost ten times. *2009 ‚Äì Inauguration of the next generation of cable cars that had already been purchased and are on display at the base of Red beach *2020 ‚Äì Closed in March 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic, partially reopened in August 2020. Rock climbing Visitors can watch rock climbers on Sugarloaf and the other two mountains in the area, Morro da Babil√¥nia and Morro da Urca. Together, they form one of the largest urban climbing areas in the world, with more than 270 routes, between 1 and 10 pitches long. Appearances in media *Flying Down to Rio (1933) Starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. The beachside Hotel Atl√¢ntico has views across the bay looking toward Sugarloaf Mountain. *In the 1979 James Bond film, Moonraker, the villainous henchman Jaws (played by Richard Kiel) attempts to kill 007 (Roger Moore) and the agent's ally, Dr. Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles), on a cable car. However, Bond and Goodhead escape and Jaws collides with the building at the bottom of the cable car route, demolishing the building, but escaping unscathed. *Herb Alpert recorded a song titled \\"Sugarloaf\\" for his 1982 album Fandango. *Mechanic: Resurrection (2016), starring Jason Statham. At the beginning of the film Arthur Bishop (Statham) is attacked at a restaurant on Morro da Urca and escapes on the roof of a cable car.

Currently led by Ancel Roget, the union was born out of the 1937 labour riots, the union was nominally led by the imprisoned TUB Butler but was actually organised by lawyer Adrian Cola Rienzi. The union was established on July 25, 1937, and formally registered on September 15. The first meetings were held in Fyzabad, and the first official headquarters were established on Coffee Street, San Fernando. In the 1960s and 1970s, under the leadership of George Weekes, the union grew into a potent political force, playing a role in the Black Power movement in 1970 and playing a role in the foundation of the United Labour Front. The Oilfields Workers' Trade Union (OWTU), widely recognized as the strongest and most militant trade union in Trinidad and Tobago and the Anglophone Caribbean, was born out of the General Strike that started on June 19, 1937, in the oilfields of south Trinidad. This was the most powerful of the mass actions that were taking place across the Caribbean, as the working class throughout the region were taking a stand and making their voices heard as they struggled against the poor working conditions which they were experiencing. At the same time the vast majority of workers faced social conditions such as very poor housing, inadequate health care, the lack of educational opportunities and racial discrimination, among other ills. From the mid-1930s workers began to express their discontent through increasingly militant actions. Unemployment was high and wages which were low were reduced even as the employer class sought to ensure that they lost little in the face of the global economic crisis precipitated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. In addition to the many issues related to the poor working and social conditions which prevailed, these struggles also had a very important political dimension. The workers were also struggling against colonialism as evidenced by their call for \\"Home Rule\\". They knew that achieving independence would be a means to improving the conditions that they were then facing. In this period of heightened mobilization against these injustices a leader emerged ‚Äì Tubal Uriah \\"Buzz\\" Butler. Under his leadership the strike began on June 19, 1937 ‚Äì the day Trinidad and Tobago commemorates today as Labour Day. The strike soon spread throughout Trinidad and involved all major sectors of workers (dockworkers, sugar workers, cocoa estate workers, railway workers and store workers) in the island. The uprising lasted until July 2, and the colonial authorities required the intervention of British troops from two battleships the Exeter and the Ajax to quell the protests. During this strike, 14 lives were lost, including that of policeman, Charlie King, hundreds were injured and many persons were arrested. It was out of these dynamic and historic circumstances that the OWTU was born. The first official meeting of the Union was held on July 15, 1937, at Mr. Williams quarters, Coon Town, Forest Reserve, Fyzabad. The first officers elected to office were Caleb Roach, Chairman, McDonald Moses, Vice President, E. R. Blades, Secretary and E. Bennet, Treasurer. The OWTU was formally established just days later on July 25, 1937, at its Founding Conference, held at Saltfish Hall, Mucurapo Street in San Fernando. The Union was registered on September 15, 1937. With Butler having to go into hiding after June 19 due to an warrant for his arrest on sedition and treason charges, a leader emerged ‚Äì Adrian Cola Rienzi - who became the Union's first President General. Rienzi also became the first President of the All Trinidad Sugar Estates and Factory Workers' Trade Union (ATSEFWTU). At the same time McDonald Moses was made Vice President of both the OWTU and the ATSEFWTU unions. The OWTU's first Central Office established at 16 Coffee Street in San Fernando was also shared by the ATSEFWTU. The Blue Shirt uniform for which the OWTU is well known has been worn since the 1930s.

(BrT, ) was a major Brazilian telecommunications company headquartered in the Brazilian capital of Brasilia. The company was one of three land lines and eight mobile telephone companies ‚Äì and only long-distance service provider ‚Äì that emerged in Brazil following the break-up of Telebr√°s. Originally the company was called Tele Centro Sul, because its service covered the states in the central and southern parts of Brazil, namely Acre, Rond√¥nia, Goi√°s, Tocantins, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Paran√°, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, as well as the Distrito Federal. Since 9 January 2009, the company is a subsidiary of Oi.  History  The Brazilian investment bank Opportunity, which managed funds for investors including Citigroup and some Brazilian pension funds, in partnership with Telecom Italia, paid 2.07 billion reais in June 1998 to buy Tele Centro Sul from the Brazilian government as part of the privatization process of Telebr√°s. In 2001, the company purchased small stake in the iBest Co. website and launched a portal and free internet access service; at the time, the Marcos Wettreich was the main shareholder in iBest. After some legal wrangling, Citigroup and the Brazilian pension funds took control of the company, removing Opportunity from the management of their respective funds and took control of the company in 2005. BrT started up a wireless service in 2004. Brasil Telecom's stock is traded on BM&F; Bovespa, where it is part of the Ibovespa index, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange. In 2008, it was announced that Brasil Telecom would be acquired by Oi.Brasil Telecom That transaction required changes in legislation, since legislation at the time prohibited a fixed telephone company from purchasing another fixed telephone company in a different license area. That legislation has since changed, and Oi completed its purchase of BrT on January 9, 2009.  Legal issues  Brasil Telecom, the country's third largest fixed-line operator, and Opportunity, which controlled Brasil Telecom, hired Kroll to determine whether Telecom Italia competed with Brasil Telecom in 2000 in the latter's acquisition of the Brazilian fixed-line phone company Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicoes ('CRT') from Spain's Telef√≥nica with the purpose of increasing the final price paid by Brasil Telecom for CRT, as both Opportunity and Telecom Italia were struggling for the control of Brasil Telecom. Brasil Telecom and Telecom Italia have been locked in court struggles since 2000. Kroll was accused of spying on Brazilian government officials. Additionally, Opportunity also became involved in legal disputes with the investors in its managed funds, namely some Brazilian pension funds and Citigroup, which culminated in Opportunity's removal as the manager of these funds and, ultimately, Opportunity's losing the control of Brasil Telecom (along with other companies controlled by the funds, namely Telemig Celular, Amazonia Celular, Santos Brasil, and Opportrans/Rio de Janeiro's subway operator).

(1877). Ann. Ottalmol., 6, 373. This law explains the visual relationship between a target angular area A and target luminance increment \\\\Delta L required for detection when that target is unresolved (that is, is too small in the field of view to make out different parts of it). The law is given by: :\\\\mathrm \\\\Delta L = \\\\frac k{\\\\mathrm A} where k is a constant (for a given background, see below). For constant background luminance L, the equation can be restated as :\\\\Delta L / L = C = \\\\frac K{\\\\mathrm A} with a different constant K. The fraction \\\\Delta L / L is referred to as Weber contrast C. Ricc√≤'s law is applicable for regions where the target being detected is unresolved. The resolution of the human eye (the receptive field size) is approximately one arc-minute in the center (the fovea center) but the size increases in peripheral vision. Ricc√≤'s law is applicable for targets of angular area less than the size of the receptive field. This region is variable based on the amount of background luminance. Ricc√≤'s law is based on the fact that within a receptive field, the light energy (or the number of photons per second) required to lead to the target being detected is summed over the area and is thus proportional to the luminance and to the area.Hood, D. C., & Finkelstein, M. A. (1986). Sensitivity to light. In K. R. Boff, L. Kaufman & J. P. Thomas (Eds.), Handbook of perception and human performance (Vol. I: Sensory processes and perception, pp. 5-1 - 5-66). New York: John Wiley. Therefore, the contrast threshold required for detection is proportional to the signal-to-noise ratio multiplied by the noise divided by the area. This leads to the above equation. The \\"constant\\" K is actually a function of the background luminance B to which the eye is assumed to be adapted. It has been shown by Andrew CrumeyCrumey, A. (2014). Human contrast threshold and astronomical visibility. MNRAS 442, 2600‚Äì2619. that for unconstrained vision (that is, observers could either look directly or at the target or avert their gaze) an accurate empirical formula for K is :K = (c_1B^{-1/4}+c_2)^2 where c1, c2 are constants taking different values for scotopic and photopic vision. For low B this approximates to the De Vries-Rose LawRose A. (1948) J. Opt. Soc. Am., 38, 196. for threshold contrast C :C\\\\equiv\\\\frac{\\\\Delta B}B \\\\propto\\\\frac 1{A\\\\sqrt{B}}. However, at very low background luminance (less than 10‚àí5 candela per square metre) the threshold value for the illuminance :\\\\Delta I=A\\\\Delta B is a constant (around 10‚àí9 lux) and does not depend on B.Crumey, op. cit., Sections 1.5, 2.1 and 2.3 In that case :C=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta B}B=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta I}{AB} or :K=\\\\frac{\\\\Delta I}B. At high B such as the daylight sky, Crumey's formula approaches an asymptotic value for K of or lux per nit.From coefficients r4 or from coefficients a3 and a5.

It was the western terminus of Route 202. It was closed and replaced with Downtown West‚ÄìKerby station. Opened in 1985 with the opening of the Northeast line, this stop was the terminus for Route 201 until the Northwest Line opened in 1987. Until the West Line to 69 Street Southwest opened in 2012, Route 202's western terminus was at this platform. In addition, some Route 201 trains going southward started trips here. It was located at the western end of the free fare zone. Unlike other side-loading platforms on the 7 Avenue S transit mall, 10 Street station was the only centre-loading platform, allowing passengers to board on either side of the station (access to the station was offered from the nearby intersection, though users commonly jumped off the platform and walked across the street). The 10 Street SW platform was one of six downtown platforms slated for refurbishment as part of the next phase of Calgary Transit's Seventh Avenue refurbishment project. The station underwent a design study in 2006, and at that time was chosen as the next of the downtown stations to be rebuilt and expanded to handle four car trains. Construction of the new station was deferred in 2007 with the approval of funding for the West LRT, and was constructed when the West LRT extension began construction in late 2009. The new station is located one block west of the current station and is designed as a dual side-loading station with a similar design to the rest of the refurbished downtown stations. 7 Avenue Refurbishment The platform served the Downtown West End community, both residential and businesses. A short walk from the platform is the Mewata Armoury, Kerby Centre (a major seniors facility) and Shaw Millennium skatepark. Greyhound Canada provided a shuttle service from the station to its bus depot. Once the West LRT project was completed in 2012, the shuttle ceased operation, as the new Sunalta station is located across a major street with an overpass to the bus terminal itself. On an unknown date in 2012, the City of Calgary website posted a .pdf page about this station being renamed. Instead of just being called \\"11 Street S.W.\\", the station's new official name will be the Downtown West‚ÄìKerby station. On September 15, 2012, this station was permanently closed and removed, in preparing for the realignment of the tracks between 9 and 10 Streets W.

Life and career Loew was born in New York City, into a poor Jewish family, who had emigrated to New York City a few years previously from Austria and Germany.Caso, Frank. \\"Marcus Loew.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 4, edited by Jeffrey Fear. German Historical Institute. Last modified January 28, 2014. He was forced by circumstances to work at a very young age and had little formal education. Nevertheless, beginning with a small investment from money saved from menial jobs, he bought into the penny arcade business. Shortly after, in partnership with Adolph Zukor and others, he founded the successful but short-lived Automatic Vaudeville Company which established a chain of arcades across several cities. After the company dissolved in 1904 Loew converted his share of the business into nickelodeons and over time he turned Loew's Theatres into a leading chain of vaudeville and movie theaters in the United States. By 1905, Marcus Loew was on his own and his success eventually necessitated that he secure a steady flow of product for his theaters. In 1904, he founded the People's Vaudeville Company, a theater chain which showcased one-reel films as well as live variety shows. In 1910, the company had considerably expanded and was renamed Loew's Consolidated Enterprises. His associates included Adolph Zukor, Joseph Schenck, and Nicholas Schenck. In addition to theaters, Loew and the Schencks expanded the Fort George Amusement Park in upper Manhattan. Marcus Loew in his office, ca.1914 By 1913, Loew operated a large number of theaters in New York City including the American Music Hall, Avenue A Theatre, Avenue B Theatre, Broadway Theatre (41st St.), Circle Theatre, and the Columbia Theatre in Brooklyn. Other Loew-operated theaters were the Delancey St. Theatre, Greeley Sq. Theatre, Herald Square Theatre, Liberty Theatre, Brooklyn, Lincoln Sq. Theatre, National Theatre (149th St.), Plaza Theatre, 7th Ave. Theatre (124th St.), Shubert Theatre, Brooklyn, and the Yorkville Theatre.Cahn-Leighton Theatrical Guide, 1913-1914 Outside of New York, he managed the Columbia Theatres of both Washington, D.C.,http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/7369 and Boston and Philadelphia‚Äôs Metropolitan Opera House. Loew found himself faced with a serious dilemma: his merged companies lacked a central managerial command structure. Loew preferred to remain in New York overseeing the growing chain of Loew's Theatres. Film production had been gravitating toward southern California since 1913. By 1917 he oversaw a number of enterprises: Borough Theatre Co., Empress Amusement Corp., Fort George Amusement Co., Glendive Amusement Corp., Greeley Square Amusement Co., Loew's Consolidated Enterprise, Loew's Theatrical Enterprises, Mascot Amusement Co., Natonia Amusement Co., People's Vaudeville Co.Directory of directors in the city of New York, 1917-1918 In 1919, Loew reorganized the company under the name Loew's, Inc.Poor's and Moody's manual, 1921 In 1920, Loew purchased Metro Pictures Corporation. A few years later, he acquired a controlling interest in the financially troubled Goldwyn Picture Corporation which at that point was controlled by theater impresario Lee Shubert. Goldwyn Pictures owned the \\"Leo the Lion\\" trademark and studio property in Culver City, California. But without its founder Samuel Goldwyn, the Goldwyn studio lacked strong management. With Loew's vice president Nicholas Schenck needed in New York City to help manage the large East Coast movie theater operations, Loew had to find a qualified executive to take charge of this new Los Angeles entity. Loew recalled meeting a film producer named Louis B. Mayer who had been operating a successful, if modest, studio in east Los Angeles. Mayer had been making low budget melodramas for a number of years, marketing them primarily to women. Since he rented most of his equipment and hired most of his stars on a per- picture basis, Loew wasn't after Mayer's brick and mortar business; he wanted Mayer and his Chief of Production, the former Universal Pictures executive, Irving Thalberg. Nicholas Schenck was dispatched to finalize the deal that ultimately resulted in the formation of Metro-Goldwyn Pictures in April 1924 with Mayer as the studio head and Thalberg chief of production. Mayer's company folded into Metro Goldwyn with two notable additions: Mayer Pictures' contracts with key directors such as Fred Niblo and John M. Stahl, and up-and- coming actress Norma Shearer, later married to Thalberg. Mayer would eventually be rewarded by having his name added to the company. Loews Inc. would act as MGM's financier and retain controlling interest for decades. While immediately successful, Loew didn't live to see the powerhouse that MGM was to become. He died three years later in 1927 of a heart attack at the age of 57 at his country home in Glen Cove, New York. Reporting his death, Variety called him \\"the most beloved man of all show business of all time\\". He was interred in the Maimonides Cemetery in Brooklyn.Jewish Telegraphic Agency For his very significant contribution to the development of the motion picture industry, Marcus Loew has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1617 Vine Street. To this day, the Loew name is synonymous with movie theaters. Personal life He and his wife Carrie had twin sons, David L Loew (1897‚Äì1973) and Arthur Marcus Loew Sr (1897‚Äì1977). Arthur married Mildred Zukor, daughter of Adolph Zukor and became president of MGM. Arthur's son Arthur Loew Jr. (1925‚Äì1995) was an actor, producer and writer.

In 1840 the ch√¢teau was modified to include two towers and a large central staircase.

The P√©cany wine was first offered for commercial sale during this time. The ch√¢teau and vineyards remained in the Siegler family until, in the spring of 1973, a local farmer and vintner Jean Saladin bought most of the vineyards for his son G√©rard Saladin. Under G.

It is native to mountainous regions of Department Tarija, Bolivia between and . Its slender, erect, grey-green columns can reach a height of , but are only about across. The columns are formed from around 25 ribs and are densely covered with areoles, supporting four yellow-brown spines up to long and 20 shorter white radials. The cactus prefers free draining soils, strong sunlight, but not high temperatures -- in fact it can withstand hard frosts down to -10 ¬∞C. In its natural habitat it receives plenty of water during the summer, but almost none over the winter. In cultivation, watering too much in winter often leads to root rot. Older cactuses, over tall, produce deep red, burgundy, flowers in late summer. The long cylindrical flowers protrude horizontally from the columns. In common with other cacti in the genus Cleistocactus, the flowers hardly open, with only the style and stamens protruding. Cultivated plants often flower freely. In the United Kingdom, this plant is usually grown under glass, and has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Etymology The silver torch cactus (Cleistocactus strausii) derives its name from the Greek word \\"kleistos\\" which means \\"closed.\\" This is due to its deep red/burgundy flowers rarely opening. Description The cactus has gray-green columns that grow up to 3 meters tall and several centimetres in diameter which are covered in white spines. Only older plants will blossom deep red/burgundy cylindrical flowers. These flowers emerge horizontally from the stem of the cactus. They are deep red to burgundy and grow up to 10cm long. Habitat The silver torch cactus, which has many names (snow pole, wooly torch), is a perennial cactus endemic to Department Tarija of Bolivia. As such, this cactus prefers mountainous regions that are dry and semi-arid. Like other cacti and succulents, it thrives in porous soil and full sun. While partial sunlight is the minimum requirement for survival, full sunlight for several hours a day is required for the silver torch cactus to bloom flowers. Silver torch cacti can thrive in low-nitrogen soil without facing the consequences of low nitrogen. Too much water will make the plants weak and lead to root rot. Conservation Status This cactus is locally abundant in its native land and has few local threats to its survival, so it is rated Least Concern. Propagation This cactus can be propagated by cuttings or seed. Cuttings should be taken near the base of the main stem, similar to cuttings for aloe vera. Rooting of this new cutting usually occurs within 3-8 weeks, therefore it is usually better to propagate silver torch cactus via seed. As a houseplant, the silver torch cactus is an easy to take care of so long as over-watering is avoided. To naturally simulate the porous effects of the sand in its native habitat, it is important to ensure that excess water will not pool in the soil, causing the roots to become water logged. Winter survival This plant‚Äôs native habitat does not have winter, but when temperatures drop to the low twenties, it can exhibit signs of tip frost. Pests Silver torch cactus is most susceptible to mealybugs and spider mite. Mealybugs are one of the most common pests of cacti and succulents. Mealybugs can be identified by their white, cottony masses on the plant. These are signs that the bugs are reproducing. These pests are especially problematic to plants such as the silver torch cactus because they suck out plant sap, depleting the strength of the plant. These plant-sucking bugs can also cause sooty mold along with their fluffy white wax, detracting from the appearance of these plants. Another form of mealybug attacks the root system of plants, which is harder to detect. Mites thrive in the same hot, dry conditions that the silver torch cactus lives in. Spider mites cause damage by sucking out vital nutrients from the plant. Large populations of mites can cause irreversible damage on the plant, eventually killing the plant. However, both pests can be hosed off the cactus with water.

Describing and mastering proper dance positions is an important part of dance technique. These dance positions of a single dancer may be further detailed into body, head, arm, hand, leg, and foot positions; also, these positions in a dance couple can additionally take into account connection, the relative orientation of partners, and directions of movement (or of movement intention). In ballet, the term \\"pose\\" is used to describe stationary dance positions; the most important are referred to as \\"first position\\" through to \\"fifth position.\\" The following includes descriptions of all major ballet positions. Development Classical ballet positions were influenced by Baroque art, especially the ideal of contraposto in sculpture, where the limbs were arranged \\"as an active spiral, denying any flattening symmetrical frontality.\\" Added to this was the \\"conscious elegance\\" and martial skill of the nobles who danced the first court ballets, whose \\"gestures were symmetrical, harmonious, circular; all opening from a central axis, based on the turned-out leg and port de bras or fencing position.... to provide a base for thrusting, dodging, and recoiling.... to move in any direction instantly.\\" In 1661, Louis XIV asked his ballet master, Pierre Beauchamp, \\"to codify, classify, and name the style and all the acceptable and successfully pretty steps.\\" Five basic foot positions Most all leg movements begin from, and end at, these five positions: # First position: This is the main ballet position, and for most beginners, it is the basic position to start from. In this standing position, the dancer‚Äôs feet remain connected at the heels, with the toes turned out at a 90-degree angle, or greater. In this position, the entire sole of the dancer‚Äôs foot and toes are in contact with the floor. The ideal turn-out angle is 180 degrees, but beginners are advised to work up to that position gradually and comfortably. # Second position: Starting with the foot placement for first position, the dancer slides one foot away from the other to create a space of roughly one and a half feet between both feet. The feet remain turned out at a 90-degree angle, or greater. The ideal turn-out is 180 degrees, \\"in straight line\\", with the feet separated by one foot. # Third position: Starting with the foot placement for first position, the dancer slides one foot slightly forward so that the back of the heel of one foot is touching the arch of the other foot. In this position, the entire sole of the dancer‚Äôs front and back foot and toes are in contact with the floor. # Fourth position: Starting with the foot placement for third position, the dancer slides the front foot directly forward, with a distance of roughly a foot between the front and back feet. In this position, the entire sole of the dancer‚Äôs front and back foot and toes are in contact with the floor. # Fifth position: Starting with the foot placement for fourth position, the dancer will slide the front foot back so that the heel of the front foot is directly touching the front toes of the back foot. In this position, both feet are parallel and the entire sole of the dancer‚Äôs front and back foot and toes are in contact with the floor. The dancer's weight should be centered between the feet, with tightened thighs and buttocks, thighs turned outward, knees in line with center of feet, shoulders down, arms rounded and slightly away from the body, head centered, and eyes straight ahead. Five basic arm positions # First position: the dancer stands as if holding a large, round object in front of the body, with a distance of one foot between their two hands. # Second position: the dancer extends both arms perpendicularly from the body in a T-shaped position, with the elbows facing back and the fingers curved slightly. # Third position: the dancer extends one arm perpendicularly from the body, as is done in second position, and extends the other arm outwards in front of the body, as is done in first position. # Fourth position: the dancer extends one arm perpendicularly from the body, as is done in second position, and raises the other arm upwards in the air, parallel to the head and neck, with hand and fingers curved slightly. # Fifth position: the dancer extends both arms overhead, parallel to the head and neck, creating an oval shape with their two curved arms. Body positions # Arabesque: a position of the body in which a dancer stands on one leg with the other leg raised behind the body, extended backward in a straight line. # Attitude: a position of the body which is a variation of the arabesque.

The nearest settlement is Bigton, also in the parish of Dunrossness. The important early medieval St Ninian's Isle Treasure of metalwork, mostly in silver, was discovered under the church floor in 1958. Many seabirds, including puffins, visit the island, with several species nesting there. History As its name suggests, the island has ecclesiastical connections, which may like others in the Northern Isles, Hebrides and Faroes have connections to the Culdees or papar. However, the island's history is far older than Christianity, and Neolithic graves have been found within the walls of the chapel (formerly beneath the floor). The ruins of a 12th-century chapel can still be seen near the end of the tombolo. The dedication is to Shetland's patron saint, the enigmatic Saint Ninian of Galloway, who is also widely venerated on the nearby Orkney Islands, and may be commemorated in the name of North Ronaldsay. In 1958, an excavation found a hoard of 8th century silver in the chapel grounds under a stone slab in a wooden box, which caused a renewed archaeological interest in the island.Haswell-Smith, Hamish.

The remains of a pre-Norse chapel were also found, which may indicate some kind of Culdee presence. The last family to live on the island, that of Henry Leask, left the island in 1796.

This new dual-platform station replaces the previous City Hall and Olympic Plaza stations both of which opened May 25, 1981, as part of Calgary's first LRT line from 8 Street W to Anderson. The original City Hall Station served only eastbound trains. The station was originally called 2 Street E. In late 1987, the station was renamed City Hall as 2 Street SE became Macleod Trail Northbound and the city did not want to call the Station Macleod Trail since it would not give a good indicator of the station's location because Macleod Trail is a long roadway traveling all the way to the very south end of the city. City Hall was chosen as the station is adjacent to the Calgary Municipal Building. Previous City Hall platform. The sandstone building behind it is Calgary City Hall. The glass building behind that is the Calgary Municipal Building. The original Olympic Plaza Station was initially called 1 Street E. It was renamed Olympic Plaza in late 1987 as its namesake is right across the street. The station was located between Macleod Trail and 1 Street SE. On May 3, 2010, the original City Hall station was closed to be demolished and rebuilt on the spot, with a new westbound platform being constructed across the street, while the original Olympic Plaza station remained open. On June 6, 2011, both City Hall platforms opened and Olympic Plaza was permanently closed and demolished shortly thereafter. After the 2011 Stampede finished, the eastbound platform (South side of 7 Avenue; adjacent to Municipal Building) was re-closed to finish construction and officially re- opened on September 19, 2011.

Originally built on an island in Clickimin Loch, it was approached by a stone causeway. The broch is situated within a walled enclosure and, unusually for brochs, features a large \\"forework\\" or \\"blockhouse\\" between the opening in the enclosure and the broch itself. The site is maintained by Historic Scotland. According to its excavator, John R.C. Hamilton, there were several periods of occupation of the site: Late Bronze Age farmstead, Early Iron Age farmstead, Iron Age fort, broch period, and wheelhouse settlement. Location Clickimin Broch is situated on the south shore of the Clickimin Loch, three-quarters of a mile south-west of Lerwick on the Lerwick-Sumburgh road. It sits on a small promontory jutting into the loch. It is one of the best preserved broch sites in Shetland. Description The broch has an external diameter of around 20 metres and an internal diameter of around 9 metres. It is surrounded by a stone-walled fort consisting of a blockhouse and ringwork. The blockhouse is a free-standing drystone gateway set just within the entrance to the fort. Access to the broch is achieved via the entrance on the western side. The entrance passage may have had a \\"guard cell\\", now blocked up, on the right side, just inside the door jamb. The interior of the broch has two cells within the walls at ground-level. Excavations have revealed the postholes for internal timber buildings and in the 19th century there were said to have been radiating stone piers visible. There are two additional entrances to the broch at upper levels. The north entrance leads both into the interior and to a staircase. The other entrance leads to an intramural gallery. History The broch was originally excavated and cleared in 1861-2. Following major vandalism and dilapidation, parts of the site were rebuilt by the Office of Works in 1908-10. It was excavated again between 1953 and 1957 by J. R. C. Hamilton, who proposed a complex chronology for it. The earliest occupation of the site, according to Hamilton, was a small Late Bronze Age farmstead of the 7th or 6th centuries BC which (he said) was superseded by a larger circular Iron Age farmhouse built about the 5th century BC. In the 4th, or early 3rd century BC, Hamilton continued, a stone-walled fort consisting of the block- house and ringwork was constructed, which was in turn superseded by the broch in about the 1st century AD. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD a large wheelhouse was built within the reduced tower and with minor outhouses, storage pits and cattle stalls dug in the debris inside the older defences. In recent years Hamilton's schema has been challenged by archaeologists and others: the ring wall, blockhouse and broch are now usually assumed to be contemporary. For a full account see B. Smith, 'How not to reconstruct the Iron Age in Shetland: modern interpretations of Clickimin broch', Northern Studies, 47, 2015. Archaeological Finds Finds include stone lamps, whetstones, bone and whalebone objects, a die, a few bronze objects, and two fragments of Roman glass.

It is located at an altitude of 700 metres, close to State Highway 73 between Darfield and Arthur's Pass. It is private property and located within the Kura Tawhiti Conservation Area. The hill was so named because of the imposing array of limestone boulders in the area reminiscent of an old, run-down stone castle. The front of ChristChurch Cathedral in Christchurch was made from Castle Hill limestone. The station was established by the Porter brothers, and later owned by brothers John and Charles Enys. John Enys was a noted entomologist, and friend of novelist Samuel Butler. It is widely considered to be the epitome of New Zealand's South Island climbing scene, where on any given day one can find rock climbers bouldering the unique limestone outcroppings. This area has recently seen more visitors, as nearby Flock Hill station was used for the filming of the climactic battle scenes of the 2005 movie, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Flock Hill also has a huge number of climbable limestone boulders though access requires a short certification procedure via the internet, unlike Kura Tawhiti which, as a conservation area, allows free access at all times.

The Union Pacific Railroad invested in quarrying operation in the valley around the town, and at one time Colorado and Southern RailwayUSGS Fort Collins 1906 1:62500 topo built a spur of their rail line from Fort Collins up to the town in order to transport stone for its own use. During its time of operation, Stout was also as a spot for the residents of the nearby town of Fort Collins to buy libations. Fort Collins had a 70 year old prohibition, preventing them from acquiring alcohol in their own. Due to transportation routes made for the stone quarry, it was easy for residents of Fort Collins to travel to Stout. These trips would end in excessive drunkenness, causing outrage from Fort Collins and Stout city officials, who worried about drunk drivers being a danger on the roads. The town was abandoned in 1949 to make way for the inundation of the valley by Horsetooth Reservoir as part of the Colorado-Big Thompson Project. Some of the former town site is located under the southern end of the reservoir.

The ridge is prominently visible as the first line of foothills along the edge of the Great Plains. It is generally faulted along its western side, and varies in height, with gaps in numerous locations where rivers exit the mountains. The ridge takes its name from the Dakota Formation, a sandstone formation that underlies the ridge. The hogback was formed during the Laramide orogeny, approximately 50 million years (50 my) ago, when the modern Rockies were created. The general uplift to the west created long faulting in the North American Plate, resulting in the creation of the hogback.Dakota Group in Northern Front Range Foothills, Colorado; Karl M.

For example, fossilized data such as dinosaur footprints have been observed in the exposed strata, created by dinosaurs which lived during the Jurassic Period approximately 150 my ago. Some of these footprints were attributed to the Diplodocus dinosaur and could be seen on the hogback west of Denver, Colorado as recently as the 1980s.Guidebook on the Geology, History, and Surface-Water Contamination and Remediation in the Area from Denver to Idaho Springs, Colorado; Edited K.C.

Thus, oyster and clam shells, sand and mud built slowly into layers of sandstone, shale, limestone, and \\"mudstone.\\". As the Rocky Mountains rose over the last 67 million years, up to nearly 30,000 feet above sea level, the soft sedimentary rocks were quickly weathered and washed away from the high mountains. But on the edge of the foothills, where the layers were scraped and pushed only slightly upward, the western edge of their remnant still stands at about a 45-degree angle - the Dakota Ridge. The top layer is a hard sandstone, the Dakota Sandstone, from which the ridge gets its name. It protects the softer shales and limestones beneath it from weathering and erosion.

It was the first release on which the original band's name Verve was changed to The Verve due to conflict with the jazz record label Verve.  Overview  \\"No Come Down\\", \\"Where the Geese Go\\", \\"Twilight\\", and \\"Six O'Clock\\" are outtakes from the sessions for the group's first album, A Storm in Heaven, and first appeared on B-sides to singles from that album. \\"Blue\\" is presented in a different (vocally upfront) \\"USA Mix\\" - released to coincide with Verve's participation in Lollapalooza. Another outtake from the band's debut album is an earlier and folkier alternate version of \\"Make It 'Til Monday\\". The \\"acoustic\\" version of \\"Butterfly\\" is actually the same take as the album version but without the lead electric guitar overdubs and with a different, earlier vocal. \\"One Way to Go\\" predates the rest of the songs on the album and is taken from the B-side to the band's first single, \\"All in the Mind\\" (it was omitted the Verve's first U.S. release, Verve EP). \\"Gravity Grave\\" is also of a slightly earlier vintage, with the version included here having been recorded live at Glastonbury Festival.

The station opened on May 25, 1981, as part of the original South line. The station is located on the exclusive LRT right of way 3.4 km south of the City Hall Interlocking, at 39 Avenue SE, just east of Macleod Trail and serves the Alyth-Manchester industrial area as well as the Elboya neighbourhood. It is located near the north end of a short tunnel that passes underneath 42nd Avenue. 229 parking spaces are available at the station on both sides. The station consists of two side-loading platforms and is completely at grade. 39 Avenue Station is the most exposed station to the elements as there is no canopy at all, unlike every other LRT station. The station was originally called 42 Avenue because 42 Avenue is a major commercial roadway in the area. In 1986, the City decided to rename the station 39 Avenue to better indicate where it is located. Calgary Transit is planning to operate four-car trains by the end of 2014. As a result, all three-car platforms are being extended. Construction work to extend the platform southwards started in April 2014 and finished in July 2014. In 2005, the station registered an average transit volume of 3,600 boardings per weekday.

The arena opened in 1971 and the region is looking to replace the aging facility with a larger one. The arena was quietly shuttered in February 2019 while new proposed replacements are in development. History Interior of arena, 2010 Until John Paul Jones Arena opened in 2006, the Richmond Coliseum was the largest sports arena in Virginia. The Virginia Commonwealth University Rams men's basketball team played in the arena until the 7,500-seat Siegel Center opened on the VCU campus in 1999. Elvis Presley performed a concert at the coliseum on April 10, 1972, with (mostly backstage) footage being used in the film Elvis on Tour which documented Presley's spring tour of that year. The Richmond Coliseum was the former part-time home of the Virginia Squires of the American Basketball Association. The Squires played there in addition to Roanoke Civic Center, Norfolk Scope and Hampton Coliseum (all within the Commonwealth of Virginia) from 1970 until just before the ABA‚ÄìNBA merger in 1976. The Coliseum also hosted the Southern Conference men's basketball tournaments in 1973 and 1974. The Sun Belt Conference men's basketball tournament was held there in 1988. The Colonial Athletic Association men's (NCAA) collegiate basketball tournament has been contested at the Richmond Coliseum since 1990. On March 1, 2006, a deal was signed to keep the tournament in Richmond until 2012. The Coliseum served as the primary home for the MEAC Men's Basketball Tournament between 1998 and 2005, with some games played at the Arthur Ashe Athletic Center. In 1994, the Coliseum hosted the Women's NCAA Division I Basketball Championship. Charlotte Smith of the University of North Carolina sank a buzzer-beating three-pointer to defeat Louisiana Tech, 60‚Äì59, in the final. The Richmond Coliseum also held the men's NCAA Tournament first and second rounds in 1990 and 1996. In 1997, a transformer fire caused electrical problems and forced events to be canceled or postponed that year. It has been a regular stop for professional wrestling promotions through the years, including the old NWA (Jim Crockett Promotions) Mid-Atlantic territory, and more recently, WWE. In recent years, it hosted the fifteenth WWF In Your House 15: A Cold Day in Hell pay-per-view in 1997, WWE Armageddon on December 17, 2006, and hosted the televised portion of the 2010 WWE Draft. It held WWE Friday Night SmackDown on November 16, 2010. It held WWE Raw on Monday, June 6, 2011 featuring WWE Hall of Famer Steve Austin to announce the winner of WWE Tough Enough. It also held Monday Night Raw again May 21, 2012, immediately following Over the Limit in which John Cena lost a match against John Laurinaitis, with Laurinaitis only winning after The Big Show intervened. It also held WWE Friday Night SmackDown on December 30, 2012, the final WWE event of the year. It hosted the December 30th, 2013, the July 14, 2014 and the May 18, 2015 editions of Raw. On September 11, 2016, it hosted the return of Backlash. On May 28th, 2018, it hosted WWE Monday Night RAW for its last time ever. The Coliseum has also been a site for the Professional Bull Riders. In 1998 and 1999, a Bud Light Cup Series event known as the Lane Frost Memorial was held in the Coliseum; the PBR returned in 2007 to host minor-league tour stops sponsored by former bull rider Greg Potter. On October 22, 2008, it hosted a rally for presidential candidate Barack Obama, drawing over 13,000 people. A similar crowd was drawn for the 2009 Republican Party of Virginia convention. The arena closed in February 2019, but has not been demolished while several proposed redevelopment projects to replace the coliseum are discussed. Future replacement In 2016, the Virginia General Assembly passed a bill, signed by governor Terry McAuliffe, authorizing the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority to build a replacement, as a way to get regional cooperation. , no plan has been yet approved. Layout The Richmond Coliseum is laid out on six levels. In order from lowest to highest they are the event level, the mezzanine, the lower concourse, the upper concourse, the 300 level and the ring. The event level is where the event floor (and ice rink) is located, as well as all the support rooms for events and the building. Team locker rooms, star dressing rooms, Exhibition halls, the Coliseum Club and the kitchens are located on the event level. The Clay Street tunnel, one of the innovative features of the coliseum, is on the event level and allows vehicles, including tractor trailers and monster trucks, to pull into the coliseum. It is accessed at the intersection of Clay Street and Eighth Street. The tunnel provides storage for shows and parking for coliseum personnel. The mezzanine is where the administrative offices for the coliseum are located. The Leigh Street entrance is on this level. The lower concourse is the access for all lower level seating and suites. The Fifth Street and Sixth Street entrances are located on this level, as well as exits to the areas above Clay Street and Leigh Street. The upper concourse is the access for all upper level seating and the 300 level is access to the highest seats on either radius of the coliseum. The ring is where the spotlights are operated and is the access to the catwalk.

Dick, first published in Worlds of Tomorrow magazine in June 1964. The manuscript, originally titled \\"Man With a Broken Match\\", was received by Dick's agent on 15 April 1963. Plot summary Death is followed by a period of 'half-life', a short amount of time which can be rationed out over long periods in which the dead can be revived‚Äîso that, potentially, they can 'live' on for a long time. When attempts to bring back important businessman Louis Sarapis fail, it's clearly more than mere negligence. Sure enough, Sarapis starts speaking from beyond the grave. From outer space, in fact. Yet no-one seems terribly bothered, other than those directly concerned in the plot mechanics. Eventually entire communications networks (phones, TV, radio) are blocked by Sarapis' broadcasts. The concept of 'half-life' was used again and developed in Dick's 1969 novel Ubik, which even re-uses a page of the novella verbatim.

The M42 40 mm Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Gun, or \\"Duster,\\" is an American armored light air-defense gun built for the United States Army from 1952 until December 1960, in service until 1988. Production of this vehicle was performed by the tank division of the General Motors Corporation. It used components from the M41 light tank and was constructed of all-welded steel. A total of 3,700 M42s were built. The vehicle has a crew of six and weighs 22,500 kg (49,500 lb) fully loaded. Maximum speed is with a range of 100 miles (160 km). Armament consists of fully automatic twin 40 mm M2A1 Bofors, with a rate of fire of 2√ó120 rounds per minute (rpm) and either a .30 caliber Browning M1919A4 or 7.62mm M60 machine gun. The 500 hp, six-cylinder, Continental (or Lycoming Engines), air-cooled, gasoline engine is located in the rear of the vehicle. It was driven by a cross-drive, two-speed Allison transmission. Although the M42 Duster was initially designed for an anti-aircraft role, it proved to be highly effective against unarmored ground forces in the Vietnam war. Development During the course of the Korean War, the U.S. Army decided to phase out all vehicles based on the M24 Chaffee chassis, such as the M19 Multiple Gun Motor Carriage 40 mm Anti-Aircraft, in favor of designs that utilized the chassis of the M41. Since the 40 mm guns were still seen as an effective anti-aircraft weapon, a modified version of the gun mount used in the M19 was mounted in a redesigned turret to accommodate the larger turret ring of the M41 and designated as the M42. Initially, the 40 mm guns were aimed with the assistance of a radar fire control system housed in a secondary vehicle of similar design but this idea was scrapped as development costs mounted. Service history Production of the M42 began in early 1952 at GM's Cleveland Tank Plant. It entered service in late 1953 and replaced a variety of different anti-aircraft systems in armored divisions. In 1956, the M42 received a new engine and other upgrades along with other M41 based vehicles, becoming the M42A1. Production was halted in December 1960 with 3,700 examples made during its production run. Sometime in the late 50s, the U.S. Army reached the conclusion that anti-aircraft guns were no longer viable in the jet age and began fielding a self-propelled version of the HAWK SAM instead. Accordingly, the M42 was retired from front line service and passed to the National Guard with the last M42s leaving the regular Army by 1963, except for the 4th Battalion, 517th Air Defense Artillery Regiment in the Panama Canal Zone, which operated two batteries of M42s into the 1970s. Vietnam War M42 Duster, MACV compound at Qu·∫£ng Tr·ªã City, February 1968. The HAWK missile system performed poorly in low altitude defense. To ensure some low altitude anti-aircraft capability for the ever-increasing amount of forces fielded in Vietnam, the Army began recalling M42A1s back into active service and organizing them into air defense artillery (ADA) battalions. Starting in the fall of 1966, the U.S. Army deployed three battalions of Dusters to the Republic of Vietnam, each battalion consisting of a headquarters battery and four Duster batteries, and each augmented by one attached Quad-50 battery and an artillery searchlight battery. Despite a few early air kills, the air threat posed by North Vietnam never materialized and ADA crews found themselves increasingly involved in ground support missions. Most often the M42 was on point security, convoy escort, or perimeter defense. The \\"Duster\\" (as it was called by U.S. troops in Vietnam) was soon found to excel in ground support. The 40 mm guns proved to be effective against massed infantry attacks. According to an article that appeared in Vietnam Magazine: =Units= Most of the Duster crew members had their AIT training in the 1st Advanced Individual Training Brigade (Air Defense) at Fort Bliss, Texas. Some of the Duster NCOs had received training at the Non Commissioned Offices Candidate School which was also held at Fort Bliss, Texas. The 1st Battalion, 44th Artillery was the first ADA battalion to arrive in Vietnam on November 1966. A self-propelled M42A1 Duster unit, the 1-44th supported the Marines at places like Con Thien and Khe Sanh Combat Base as well as Army divisions in South Vietnam's rugged I Corps region. The battalion was assigned to First Field Force Vietnam (IFFV) and was located at ƒê√¥ng H√†. In 1968 it was attached to the 108th Artillery Group (Field Artillery). Attached to the 1-44th was G Battery 65th Air Defense Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and G Battery 29th Artillery Searchlights. The 1-44th served alongside the 3rd Marine Division along the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) in I Corps thru December 1971. Sergeant Mitchell W. Stout was a member of C Battery, 1-44th Artillery. He was awarded the Medal of Honor. Also killed in this action was SP-4 Terry Lee Moser, of Barto, Pennsylvania, also assigned to C Battery, 1-44th Artillery. The second Duster battalion to arrive in Vietnam was the 5th Battalion, 2nd Air Defense Artillery. Activated in June 1966 it arrived in Vietnam in November 1966 and was diverted to III Corps, Second Field Force (IIFFV) and set up around Bien Hoa Air Base. Attached units were D Battery71st Air Defense Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and I Battery, 29th Artillery Searchlights. The \\"Second First\\" served the southern Saigon region through mid 1971. D-71st Quads remained active through March 1972. The third Duster battalion to arrive was the 4th Battalion, 60th Air Defense Artillery. Activated in June 1966 it arrived in Vietnam in June 1967 and set up operations in the Central Highlands, based out of An Kh√™ (1967‚Äì70) and later Tuy Hoa (1970-71). Attached units were E Battery 41st Artillery equipped with Quad-50s and B Battery, 29th Artillery Searchlights (which were already in country since October 1965). Members of these units not only covered the entire Central Highlands, but also supported firebases and operations along the DMZ to the north and Saigon to the south. Each Duster Battalion had four line batteries (A, B, C, D) and a headquarters battery. Each battery had two platoons (1st, 2nd), which contained four sections each with a pair of M42A1 Dusters. At full deployment there were roughly 200 M42 Dusters under command throughout the entire war. The Duster and Quads largely operated in pairs at firebases, strong points, and in support of engineers building roads and transportation groups protecting convoys. At night they protected the firebases from attack and were often the first targets of enemy sappers, rockets, and mortars. Searchlight jeeps operated singularly but often in support of a Duster or Quad section at a firebase. Between the three Duster battalions and the attached Quad-50 and Searchlight batteries over 200 fatalities were recorded.Air Defense Artillery in Vietnam Post Vietnam The three M42A1 equipped ADA battalions (1-44th, 4-60th and 5-2d) deactivated and left Vietnam in late December 1971. Most if not all of the in-country Dusters were turned over to ARVN forces. Most of the training Dusters at Fort Bliss were returned to various National Guard units. The U.S. Army maintained multiple National Guard M42 battalions as a corps- level ADA asset. 2nd Battalion, 263 ADA, headquartered in Anderson, SC was the last unit to operate the M42 when the system was retired in 1988.

The station consists of a center-loading platform with mezzanine access on the North end and grade-level access at the South end. The station is located primarily near residential areas to the west (the Southwood neighbourhood), and to the east of the station is the Southland Park business centre and Macleod Trail commercial strip, including the Southcentre Mall and the residential areas of Willow Park and Acadia. 650 spaces are available for parking at the station. In 2005, the station registered an average transit of 10,500 boardings per weekday. On July 12, 2016 a flash flood occurred at Southland Park and Ride. This flash flood flooded with high water marks on some cars above the headlights of the cars causing water ingress into engines and car interiors. Upgrades The station was originally accessible only from the West side of the tracks; accessing the Southland Business Center required a long walk north to Southland Drive, along Southland Drive over the tracks, and South again on the other side. In November 2009, a pedestrian overpass was added to the Southland Park business centre, which allows for much quicker access to the business park. Southland station was originally built to accommodate the three-car trains in use at the time of construction. On February 3, 2011, construction was begun to renovate the platform to accommodate 4-car trains.

Early life Rechner was born in Spring Lake Heights, New Jersey.Rosenberg, Michelle. \\"‚ÄòThe American Dream‚Äô lives on in Keyport: Wrestling legend Dusty Rhodes headlines local charity event\\" , Independent, October 12, 2004; accessed June 12, 2012. \\"Also at the event, Candido will take on John ‚ÄúBalls‚Äù Mahoney, a Spring Lake Heights native of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) fame, in an extreme strap match.\\" He started wrestling at the age of 15. Professional wrestling career=Early Career(1987‚Äì1993) Rechner trained at the Monster Factory and debuted in 1987, at age 15, as Abbudah Singh. He began wrestling in the independent circuit in New Jersey. He jobbed in the World Wrestling Federation from 1992 to 1993. Smoky Mountain Wrestling (1994‚Äì1995) He made a name for himself as Boo Bradley Jr. (a take-off of the character Boo Radley from To Kill a Mockingbird) in Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). He was originally allied with Chris Candido and managed by Tammy Sytch, who abused him for months, but they eventually turned on him, killing his pet cat, and turning him into a fan favorite in the process. He formed a friendship with Cactus Jack during this time. He went on to have a lengthy rivalry with Candido and Sytch. After his battles with Candido he moved on to a feud with Killer Kyle of the Gangstas. During his time in SMW Bradley won the SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship twice. World Wrestling Federation (1995‚Äì1996) In 1995, he briefly appeared in the World Wrestling Federation as Xanta Klaus. From 1992‚Äì93 he jobbed under his real name losing to Papa Shango, Marty Jannetty, and Virgil. At In Your House 5: Seasons Beatings in December, while Savio Vega and \\"Santa Claus\\" were at ringside handing out presents and playing to the fans, villainous manager \\"Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase appeared. DiBiase proclaimed that everyone had a price, even Santa. As Vega argued with DiBiase, \\"Santa\\" jumped him from behind and attacked him. DiBiase laughed his trademark laugh and introduced this warped Santa as Xanta Klaus, from the South Pole who steals presents. As Xanta, Rechner made only a couple more appearances (one on the following night's Monday Night Raw), before never being mentioned again. Mid Eastern Wrestling Federation (1996‚Äì1997) After WWF, Rechner wrestled as Boo Bradley for Mid Eastern Wrestling Federation where he became the MEWF Mid-Atlantic Champion. Extreme Championship WrestlingHardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks (1996‚Äì1999)= In 1996, Rechner signed with Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and found success as Balls Mahoney. Capitalizing on the ECW crowd's lust for violence and the hardcore attitude Rechner was never seen without his signature steel chair, usually with some kind of writing or sign placed on it, which he would use to bash any opponent at any time. He would come to the ring to the AC/DC song \\"Big Balls\\" and lead the crowd in singing the chorus before or after his matches. While in ECW he teamed with Axl Rotten, a similar hardcore and violent wrestler, and the duo became informally known as \\"The Hardcore Chair Swingin' Freaks\\". They feuded with The Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh Ray and D-Von) during their tenure. Mahoney made his pay-per-view debut at November to Remember, participating in a Four-Way Dance match for the Tag Team Championship, along with his partner Rotten; The F.B.I. (Tracy Smothers and Little Guido) retained the titles. At Living Dangerously, they participated in a three-way dance, along with the Dudleyz in a losing effort to Spike Dudley and New Jack. Mahoney and Rotten got another chance at the titles at Wrestlepalooza against Chris Candido and Lance Storm, but lost. After failing to win the titles with Rotten, Mahoney found a new partner in Masato Tanaka. At November to Remember, the two defeated Dudley Boyz to win the World Tag Team Championship, thus beginning Mahoney's first reign as tag champion. Six days later, Mahoney and Tanaka dropped the title to the Dudleyz in a rematch. At Guilty as Charged, Mahoney and Rotten defeated the F.B.I. and Danny Doring and Roadkill in a three-way dance. Mahoney's first singles match at a pay-per- view was a victory over Steve Corino at Living Dangerously. Shortly after, Mahoney formed a tag team with Spike Dudley. At Hardcore Heaven, the two faced the Dudleyz in a championship match but failed to win the title. The two teams faced in a rematch at Heat Wave, and this time, Mahoney and Dudley won the match and the World Tag Team Championship, marking Mahoney's second individual reign. At a show in August, the duo re-lost the title to the Dudleyz. On the edition of August 14 of ECW on TNN, Mahoney and Dudley defeated the Dudleyz in another rematch to win back the World Tag Team Championship. On the edition of August 26 of ECW on TNN, they lost the titles to the Dudleyz again. At Anarchy Rulz, ECW World Television Champion Rob Van Dam was scheduled to defend his title against Johnny Smith but before the match, Mahoney, Rotten, and Dudley attacked Smith and took him out of the match. Mahoney then challenged RVD for the title but lost the match. At November to Remember, Mahoney and Rotten lost to Da Baldies (Spanish Angel, Tony DeVito, Vito LoGrasso, and P.N. News) in a 4-on-2 handicap match. =Final days of ECW (2000‚Äì2001)= During an exchange of blows, ECW fans would often chant \\"Balls!\\" when Rechner landed a punch or kick on an opponent, and \\"Nuts!\\" when his opponent retaliated. At Living Dangerously, he defeated Kintaro Kanemura. He met his former tag team partner, Masato Tanaka in the first match at Hardcore Heaven, which Tanaka won. At Heat Wave, he lost a match to F.B.I. member Sal E. Graziano. He formed a tag team with Chilly Willy and the duo feuded with Da Baldies. After losing a match to Da Baldies at Anarchy Rulz, Mahoney and Willy defeated them in a Flaming Tables match at November to Remember. At Massacre on 34th Street, Mahoney lost to EZ Money. Mahoney's final ECW appearance was at ECW's final pay-per-view Guilty as Charged where Mahoney and Chilly Willy's match with Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger ended in a no contest. Independent circuit (2001‚Äì2006) After ECW folded, Rechner spent a time in a number of independent federations across America, most notably USA Pro Wrestling (UXW) as well as Juggalo Championship Wrestling where he united with The Dead Pool (Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, and Raven) to become The Dead Pool 2000. He did make an appearance in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) in 2004, teaming with The Sandman to face off against The Gathering. On January 9, 2004 he wrestled for Ring Of Honor losing to Samoa Joe.

After the main event, Mahoney and Rotten returned to the ring to brawl with the \\"invading\\" Raw and SmackDown! wrestlers. In 2006, when WWE relaunched ECW as their own brand, one of the first announcements was the signing of Balls Mahoney. His signing was announced with that of Axl Rotten, but when Rotten missed some WWE dates and was released, Balls was left to start a singles career. During the \\"cross promotion\\" hype, Balls appeared on the June 5 edition of Raw with other ECW wrestlers who proceeded to attack WWE Champion John Cena. He appeared again as a part of the ECW team in the \\"WWE vs. ECW team battle royal\\" at the WWE vs. ECW Head to Head event on June 7. At One Night Stand, Balls defeated Masato Tanaka in a match following a chair shot (denting the chair) to Tanaka's head. Balls in the ring at ECW December to Dismember in December 2006 When ECW on Sci Fi debuted, Balls started off with a small role in the company, having sporadic matches and little else. Once the show got going he started to appear in vignettes talking about how tough he was, elevating his role on the show. On the edition of September 5 of ECW on Sci Fi Mahoney entered a feud with Kevin Thorn after Thorn and his valet Ariel cost him a match against Stevie Richards and the next week, Ren√© Dupr√©e. The following week, he brought Francine to ringside with him, marking her first televised appearance at the revived ECW ring, where she proceeded to get into a catfight with Ariel. That pairing, however, was short lived as Francine was released shortly after. At December to Dismember, Mahoney defeated Matt Striker in a Striker's Rules match. On the edition of January 2, 2007 of ECW on Sci Fi, Mahoney had one of his front teeth legitimately knocked out during a match with Kevin Thorn. Shortly after, Balls began a short feud with Snitsky. On the edition of June 5 of ECW, Balls, Tommy Dreamer, and the Sandman faced Bobby Lashley in a 3 on 1 Hardcore Handicap match for the ECW Championship, in which they were defeated. On the August 7, 2007 episode of ECW, Balls went against The Miz in a losing effort. During and after the match, it appeared that Kelly Kelly was concerned about him. Over the weeks that followed, he attempted to ask her out and flirted with her backstage, but was interrupted by The Miz, Brooke, and Layla before Kelly could get a word in. Regardless, Kelly still showed interest in him each week, wishing him good luck before his match and cheering him on during his match. He asked if she would go out with him to which she could not respond due to The Miz taking her backstage. Weeks later, however, Kelly asked him out, starting an on-screen relationship. On February 29, 2008, Balls made his return to television on SmackDown!, taking on Big Daddy V. The match went to a no contest after The Undertaker chokeslammed Mahoney. Mahoney was released from his WWE contract on April 28, 2008.Balls Mahoney released, wwe.com; accessed April 12, 2016.

Moments later, his wife noticed he was unconscious and called 911 before attempting CPR. However, he had already died before medics arrived. His death was first reported via Twitter by Johnny Candido. His autopsy was released in August 2016, where it ruled that he had died of a heart attack. On October 21, 2016, it was revealed Rechner had suffered from CTE.

According to Buddhist tradition and modern academic consensus, Gautama Buddha was born c. 563‚Äì483 BCE in Lumbini (what is now Nepal) and raised in the Shakya capital of Kapilavastu.UNESCO, Lumbini in Nepal is the birthplace of the Lord Buddha, Gethin Foundations, p. 19, which states that in the mid-3rd century BCE the Emperor Ashoka determined that Lumbini was Gautama's birthplace and thus installed a pillar there with the inscription: \\"... this is where the Buddha, sage of the ≈öƒÅkyas (≈öƒÅkyamuni), was born.\\"For instance, Gethin Foundations, p. 14, states: \\"The earliest Buddhist sources state that the future Buddha was born SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama (Pali Siddhattha Gotama), the son of a local chieftain‚Äîa rƒÅjan‚Äîin Kapilavastu (Pali Kapilavatthu) what is now the Indian‚ÄìNepalese border.\\" However, Professor Gombrich (TheravƒÅda Buddhism, p. 1) and the old but specialized study by Edward Thomas, The Life of the Buddha, ascribe the name Siattha/fitta to later sources. The exact date of Buddha's birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars. The date for the celebration of Buddha's birthday varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June. In South and Southeast Asia, the Buddha's birth is celebrated as part of Vesak, a festival that also celebrates the Buddha's enlightenment and death. In East Asia, the awakening and death of the Buddha are observed as separate holidays.  Date  The exact date of Buddha's Birthday is based on the Asian lunisolar calendars and is primarily celebrated in Baisakh month of the Buddhist calendar and the Bikram Sambat Hindu calendar. This is the reason behind the term Vesak. In modern-day India and Nepal, where the Historical Buddha lived, it is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Buddhist calendar. In Theravada countries following the Buddhist calendar, it falls on the full moon, Uposatha day, typically in the 5th or 6th lunar month. In China and Korea, it is celebrated on the eighth day of the fourth month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The date varies from year to year in the Western Gregorian calendar, but usually falls in April or May. In leap years it may be celebrated in June. In Tibet, it falls on the 7th day of the fourth month of the Tibetan calendar.  South and Southeast Asia and Mongolia  In South Asian and Southeast Asian countries as well as Mongolia, Buddha's birthday is celebrated on the full moon day of the Vaisakha month of the Buddhist calendar and the Hindu calendar, which usually falls in April or May of the Western Gregorian calendar. The festival is known as Buddha Purnima, as Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit. It is also called Buddha Jayanti, with Jayanti meaning birthday in Sanskrit.

The date falls from the end of April to the end of May according to the Gregorian calendar. The primarily solar Gregorian calendar date varies from year to year: * 2017: May 3 * 2018: May 22 * 2019: May 12 * 2020: April 30 =Taiwan= In 1999 the Taiwanese government set Buddha's birthday as the second Sunday of May, the same date as Mother's Day. =Japan= As a result of the Meiji Restoration, Japan adopted the Gregorian calendar in lieu of the Chinese lunar calendar in 1873. However, it took approximately until 1945, the end of World War II, for religious festivities to adopt the new calendar. In most Japanese temples, Buddha's birth is now celebrated on the Gregorian and buddhist calendar date April 8; only a few (mainly in Okinawa) celebrate it on the orthodox Chinese calendar date of the eighth day of the fourth lunar month.

On the days preceding Purnima, Buddhist monks and priests decorate Buddhist temples with colourful decorations and candles. On the day of the festival, the President and Prime Minister deliver speeches addressing the history and importance of Buddhism, and of religious harmony in the country. From noon onwards large fairs are held in and around the temples and viharas, selling Bengali food (largely vegetarian), clothes, and toys. Performances of Buddha's life are also presented. Buddhist monks teach celebrants about the Dharma and the Five Precepts (panchashila). Buddhists then attend a congression inside the monastery where the chief monk delivers a speech discussing the Buddha and the Three Jewels (tri-ratna), and about living the ideal life. Afterwards, a prayer to the Buddha is offered, and people then light candles and recite the Three Jewels and Five Precepts.\\"‡¶¨‡ßÅ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶ß ‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£‡¶ø‡¶Æ‡¶æ\\", ‡¶∏‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßá ‡¶®‡ßá‡¶á, ‡¶¶‡ßà‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶£‡ßç‡¶†; ‡ßß‡ßß ‡¶Æ‡ßá ‡ß®‡ß¶‡ßß‡ßß ‡¶ñ‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡•§ ‡¶™‡ßÉ. ‡ß™‡•§ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¶‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶∂‡¶®‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶ñ: ‡ßß‡ß≠ ‡¶Æ‡ßá ‡ß®‡ß¶‡ßß‡ßß ‡¶ñ‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶¶‡•§ =Cambodia= In Cambodia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Visak Bochea and is a public holiday where monks around the country carry the Buddhist flag, lotus flowers, incense, and candles to acknowledge Vesak.

Lanterns are lit to symbolise the Buddha's enlightenment and many people visit the temple to pay their respects. The bathing of statues of the Buddha is a major feature of Buddha's birthday celebrations in the city. The festival is also a public holiday in Macau. =India= The public holiday for Buddha purnima in India was initiated by B. R. Ambedkar when he was the minister of law and justice. It is celebrated especially in Sikkim, Ladakh, Arunachal Pradesh, Bodh Gaya, various parts of North Bengal such as Kalimpong, Darjeeling, and Kurseong, and Maharashtra (where 77% of total Indian Buddhists live), as well as other parts of India as per Indian calendar. Buddhists go to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than- usual, full-length Buddhist sutra, akin to a service. The dress code is pure white. Non-vegetarian food is normally avoided. Kheer, sweet rice porridge is commonly served to recall the story of Sujata, a maiden who, in Gautama Buddha's life, offered the Buddha a bowl of milk porridge. Informally called \\"Buddha's Birthday,\\" it actually commemorates the birth, enlightenment (nirvƒÅna), and death (ParinirvƒÅna) of Gautama Buddha in the Theravada tradition. Tibetans in exile remember Buddha's birthday on the 7th day of the Saga Dawa month (fourth month of the Tibetan calendar), which culminates with Buddha's parinirvana celebrations on the full moon day. =Indonesia= In Indonesia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Waisak and is a public holiday.

Buddha's birth is also celebrated according to the Buddhist calendar but is not a national holiday. On this day, all temples hold ÈôçË™ï‰ºö (G≈çtan-e), ‰ªèÁîü‰ºö (Bussh≈ç-e), Êµ¥‰ªè‰ºö (Yokubutsu-e), ÈæçËèØ‰ºö (Ry≈´ge-e) and Ëä±‰ºöÂºè (Hana- eshiki). Japanese people pour ama-cha (a beverage prepared from hydrangea serrata, a variety of hydrangea) on small Buddha statues decorated with flowers, as if bathing a newborn baby. The tradition of bathing the Buddha originated in China and was introduced to Japan where it was first held in Nara in 606. Lion dancing is also a major tradition practiced during Buddha's Birthday and has become associated with the festival in Japan. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Wesak Day and is a public holiday celebrated by the sizeable minority Buddhist population in the country. Temples across the country are decorated, and caged animals are set free. People engage in prayers, chanting, and alms-giving across the country. =Mongolia= In Mongolia, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Ikh Duichen and its date is determined by the Mongolian lunar calendar. As a result, the date falls in line with celebrations of Buddha's Birthday/Vesak in South and Southeast Asian countries as opposed to neighbouring East Asian countries. In December 2019, the popularly celebrated festival by many Mongolian Buddhists, is made a public holiday. =Myanmar= In Myanmar, Buddha's Birthday is celebrated as Full Moon of Kason and is a public holiday. It is celebrated by watering the Bodhi tree and chanting. In large pagodas, music and dance is also performed as part of the celebrations. =Nepal= Buddha statues at Swayambhu in Nepal In Nepal, Buddha's birthday is celebrated on the full moon day of May. The festival is known by various names, Buddha Jayanti, Buddha Purnima, Vaishakh Purnima, Saga Dawa, and Vesak. Purnima means full moon day in Sanskrit. Among the Newars of Nepal, especially from the Shakya clan of Newars, it is of great importance because they consider it as a continuation of the sage of the ≈öƒÅkyas- the clan that Lord Buddha's family belonged to. Thus, they celebrate the festival which is in their language known as SwƒÅnyƒÅ Punhi (‡§∏‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§Ç‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§™‡•Å‡§®‡•ç‡§π‡§ø), the full moon day of flowers. The day marks not just the birth of Shakyamuni Gautama Buddha, but also the day of his Enlightenment and Mahaparinirvana. The event is celebrated by gentle and serene fervour, keeping in mind the very nature of Buddhism. People, especially women, go to common Viharas to observe a rather longer-than-usual, full-length Buddhist sutra, something like a service. The usual dress is pure white. Non-vegetarian food is normally avoided. Kheer, sweet rice porridge is commonly served to recall the story of Sujata, a maiden who offered the Buddha a bowl of milk porridge.

Dressed in formal black robes, the roughly 70 monks and students form a formal procession to the Horse Pasture with the leader periodically ringing a small, clear bell. A temporary stone altar was built under a huge oak tree in a gorgeous field of green grass and abundant wildflowers; a small statue of a baby Buddha was placed upon it in a metal basin.

It serves the South Line (Route 201) and May 25, 1981, as part of the original line. The station is located on the exclusive LRT right of way (adjacent to CPR ROW), 10.6 km south of the City Hall Interlocking. The station is located just north of Anderson Road near Macleod Trail. History The station was, until October 8, 2001, the southern terminus of the South Line, having served in this capacity since the LRT's original opening in 1981. The station is located primarily near residential areas such as Southwood and Willow Park, and it also provides access to the Southcentre Mall, by means of a pedestrian bridge and skywalk that cross Macleod Trail. 1323 paved parking spaces are located on-site, as well as a 427 space overflow lot. The station consists of a center-loading platform with Mezzanine access at the South end and grade- level access at the North end. As part of Calgary Transit's plan to operate 4-car trains by the end of 2014, all 3-car platforms are being extended. Construction on the platform extension at Anderson Station started on June 24, 2013 and was completed in the late fall of 2013. In January 2018, the south entrance to the Mezzanine level was closed as crews removed the entrance in preparation for renovations. On April 2, 2018, the Mezzanine level was closed to perform renovations. The grade-level entrance remained open, as well as the station itself while renovations are underway. Renovations were expected to be completed by October 2018 but due to soil and structural issues arising during construction, the completion date was extended to Spring of 2019 with construction being completed in June 2019. The Anderson Shops and Garage, where the CTrain vehicles are maintained, is located here. CTrains operating on the NE line had to come up from the Anderson Garage every morning from the opening of the NE line in 1985 until the Oliver Bowen Maintenance Facility opened with McKnight‚ÄìWestwinds Station in 2008. In 2005, the station registered and average transit of 11,300 boardings per weekday. Conventional Train In 1996, Siemens brought a RegioSprinter DMU (diesel multiple unit) railcar as part of a demonstration tour of North America. A new passenger platform was added on the CP Rail line adjacent to Anderson station. The RegioSprinter was operated between this platform and a platform at 162 Avenue SW located near present-day Somerset‚ÄìBridlewood station. This service was only in operation during peak hours and was discontinued after a few months when RegioSprinter continued its tour but this service proved to be very popular and it convinced the city board to plan the extension of the SE line to Somerset‚ÄìBridlewood Station in two phases.

It is part of the Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler complex. Description Some of Camp Foster's area overlaps with Okinawa City, Chatan town and Kitanakagusuku village in the Japanese prefecture of Okinawa Island. It houses the headquarters of Marine Corps Base Butler, Marine Corps Installations Pacific and the Okinawa Area Field Office of United States Forces Japan. It was named after the Medal of Honor recipient PFC William A. Foster. Among its amenities are a large exchange with an adjacent food court. There is a smaller exchange ‚ÄúPX‚Äù next to the large exchange, which has a nail salon, barber shop, soft bank, AU, and a toy land. Near the commissary is a bowling alley, skate park, performing arts center and movie theater. The base operates three schools: Zukeran and Killin elementary schools and Kubasaki High School. The base's housing units include Kishaba, Chatan, Futenma, Plaza and Sada. Environmental investigation In October 2013 Japanese officials entered the base with US permission to look for buried cultural properties. They discovered dozens of abandoned metal drums, but did not report this to the Ginowan city's mayor until March 2014. Members of the Japanese defense ministry's local bureau and Ginowan city visually inspected the site, as part of its cultural property research and \\"no unusual odor or color change in soil\\" was detected. Also apparently no health problems have been actively \\"reported by residents living around the base\\". Ginowan city government had called the Japanese defense ministry's to investigate for \\"possible environmental impacts\\". The Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said: \\"We will take appropriate measures in cooperation with the United States and the city of Ginowan\\" as they plan environmental studies on soil in the week of 18 March 2014. The United States rarely allow environmental inspections on U.S. bases not planned for return to Japan. Land Return The Futenma housing area of the base originally was to be returned to Japan between 2001 and 2003, 5‚Äì7 years from 1996. In 2006, the Nishi-Futenma housing area at Camp Foster was vacated and slated for return to Japan, but Japanese concerns of contamination stalled the transfer. For example, bungalows in the military housing area built in the 1950s were insulated with asbestos. Per the U.S.-Japan Status of Forces Agreement from 1960 the U.S military is not responsible for the remediation of land polluted by its bases in Japan. Because the central government has not challenged the dated agreement, the Okinawa Prefectural Assembly created its own special committee regarding U.S. bases, to collect information directly about past use and storage of chemicals. In October 2013 it created a department of pollution, which would circumvent the central government and its environmental investigations, which some believe are not interested in communicating the true levels of pollution. On 31 March 2015 the West Futenma housing area on Camp Foster was returned to Okinawa Prefecture, reducing and consolidating land used by the U.S. military. A 20-hectare part of the area is earmarked for a medical division with plans to build a prefecture administered advanced heavy particle cancer therapy facility. The University of the Ryukyus Faculty of Medicine, including the University Hospital, is also scheduled to move from its current location in Nishihara into a new facility to be constructed on the land.

Founding of Mission Pak Page worked as a busboy (which he initially believed meant steering a bus) and a soda jerk until he had earned $1000. With this capital, in 1917, he bought a vacant store and founded a distribution company, Mission Pak, which shipped California fruits such as oranges as holiday gifts to cold-weather customers. The idea came to Page as he boxed oranges home to his mother and brother one year earlier: 37 residents at his boardinghouse had asked if he would do them the same courtesy; the company proved enormously successful.Grand Rapid Press (Michigan), \\"California philanthropist,\\" November 30, 2000. (The Mission Pak jingle is still familiar to many older Angelenos: \\"Say the Magic words, say Mission Pak and it's on its merry way! No gift so bright, so gay, so right, give the Mission Pak magic way!\\")Oliver, The Los Angeles Times, ibid. Mr. Page was interviewed for Studs Terkel's book, The Good War, about his experiences as an entrepreneur and real estate developer during World War II. At the time of Page's death, the president of the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County observed, \\"The story of George C. Page embodies the American dream. His like will not come our way again.\\"City News Service, \\"Longtime Los Angeles Philanthropist George C. Page Dies,\\" 29 November 2000. Entrepreneur  Capitalizing on his shipping company's success, Page founded a sports-car manufacturing plant. After selling Mission Pak in 1946, Page moved into real estate development; he built industrial and commercial parks, and leased space to the defense and aerospace industries and the federal government. Having begun as a packager, Page thought this brought an edge to real estate; Page was always attentive to the value good landscaping could add to a project.Oliver, The Los Angeles Times, ibid. Philanthropist Page financed the construction of buildings at Children's Hospital Los Angeles (the George C. Page Building), at Loyola Marymount University (George C. Page Stadium), and in the district of Hawthorne, Los Angeles (the George C. Page Youth Center), along with arts programs at the University of Southern California and buildings and scholarships at Pepperdine University in Malibu. The Pepperdine University Law School dormitories are named in his honor. The La Brea Tar Pits Page had begun visiting the La Brea Tar Pits while in his late teens; it troubled him that to move from pits to the disinterred fossilized remains required a seven-mile (11.3 km) trip to the Natural History museum. A half-century later, the museum that bears his name was opened to the public in April 1977. Page had devoted great care into each element of the museum‚Äîattractive fossil presentation, so it would not simply be \\"bones, bones, bones\\"; testing the most comfortable underfoot surface‚Äîcarpet, not marble‚Äîand limiting the museum to exhibits that could be easily covered in about an hour. Among the site's visitors, five million in its first decade, were professional curators interested to see what Page, as an amateur, had put together. \\"The thing that made me feel awfully good,\\" Page told the Los Angeles Times in 1982, \\" was that they said, 'George Page, we have never been in a museum with things displayed so well.'\\" Page described The George C.

The tower was built in 1600 by Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney, during his brief period as de facto ruler of Shetland. History In 1564, Robert Stewart (1533‚Äì1593), illegitimate son of King James V, was granted lands in Orkney and Shetland and subsequently established himself as a powerful but unscrupulous figure in the islands. Despite numerous complaints against him for seizing lands and misusing taxes, Stewart was later made Earl of Orkney and Lord of Shetland by King James VI. He remained unpopular with the local lairds, and they subsequently turned the king against Stewart, who died impoverished in 1593, having had his Earldom revoked in 1587. Robert Stewart's son Patrick (c. 1566 ‚Äì 6 February 1615), who had been on unfriendly terms with his father, remained in the king's favour and was himself created Lord of Shetland in 1590. He effectively succeeded as Earl of Orkney on his father's death, though this was not formalised until 1600. In Shetland he continued to appropriate lands and feuded with the lairds: Laurence Bruce of Cultmalindie, son of Robert Stewart's ally, became his chief opponent. Tingwall, at that time the church for Scalloway Following his charter of the Earldom in 1600, Stewart began the construction of Scalloway Castle which was completed around 1607. His main residence was the Earl's Palace, built by his father on Birsay, Orkney, while Scalloway was used by his representative in Shetland. The new castle also served as a meeting place for the thing (parliament) of Shetland during Earl Patrick's ascendancy. Construction of the castle was undertaken by unpaid workers, summoned by Patrick from the parishes of Shetland, and was overseen by his master of works, Andrew Crawford. Crawford was probably also responsible for Patrick's Earl's Palace in Kirkwall, and Muness Castle on Unst, built for Bruce of Cultmalindie. In 1609 the Shetland lairds complained to the king of Earl Patrick's misrule of the islands. Patrick was subsequently imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle, and was executed in 1615 for encouraging his son Robert to retake his Orkney possessions. Meanwhile, control of the islands was given over to James Law, Bishop of Orkney, who held his first court at Scalloway Castle in August 1612. In 1653 troops were stationed in the castle, and by the early 18th century its condition was described as poor. Some of the ornamental stonework was removed to be incorporated into the Haa of Sand, an 18th-century house to the north- west of Scalloway. The ruins were placed into state care in 1908, and are now maintained by Historic Scotland. Excavations in 1979‚Äì1980 uncovered the remains of 17th-century outbuildings to the north of the tower. Description Detail of the corbelling on the castle Scalloway Castle is built on an L-plan, with a main tower of , and a wing to the south-west of square. The roofless castle is of four storeys, with an additional garret over the main tower. The ground level is tunnel-vaulted, containing kitchens, stores and a well. A straight staircase leads up to the hall on the first floor, with spiral stairs leading to upper storeys. Around the third floor are bartizans (corner towers) projected on decorative corbelling. There is an inscription above the door, illegible today but recorded in the 18th century as \\"Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney and Shetland. James V King of Scots. That house whose foundation is on a rock shall stand but if on sand shall fall...\\" The castle is a scheduled monument.

It was painted on the bank of the Rh√¥ne that was only a one or two-minute walk from the Yellow House on the Place Lamartine, which Van Gogh was renting at the time. The night sky and the effects of light at night provided the subject for some of van Gogh's more famous paintings, including Caf√© Terrace at Night (painted earlier the same month) and the June, 1889, canvas from Saint-Remy, The Starry Night. A sketch of the painting is included in a letter van Gogh sent to his friend Eug√®ne Boch on 2 October, 1888. Starry Night, which is now in the Mus√©e d'Orsay in Paris, was first exhibited in 1889 at Paris' annual exhibition of the Soci√©t√© des Artistes Ind√©pendants. It was shown together with van Gogh's Irises, which was added by Vincent's brother, Theo, although Vincent had proposed including one of his paintings from the public gardens in Arles. Subject matter A similar view of the site, 2008 The view is from the quay (a waterside street) on the east side of the Rh√¥ne, into the knee of the river towards the western shore: coming down from the north, the Rh√¥ne turns to the right at this point to surround the rocks on which Arles is built. From the towers of Saint-Julien and Saint-Trophime at the left, the spectator follows the east bank up to the iron bridge connecting Arles to the suburb of Trinquetaille on the right, western bank. This implies a view from Place Lamartine towards the southwest. Genesis Van Gogh announced and described this composition in a letter to his brother Theo: In reality, the view depicted in the painting faces away from Ursa Major, which is to the north. The foreground indicates heavy rework, wet-in-wet, as soon as the first state was finished.For a tracing of the original composition see Roland Dorn 1990, ill. p. 388 The letter sketches executed at this time probably are based on the original composition. Colours of the night The challenge of painting at night intrigued van Gogh. The vantage point he chose for Starry Night allowed him to capture the reflections of the gas lighting in Arles across the glimmering blue water of the Rh√¥ne. In the foreground, two lovers stroll by the banks of the river. Depicting colour was of great importance to Vincent; in letters to his brother, Theo, he often described objects in his paintings in terms of colour. His night paintings, including Starry Night, emphasize the importance he placed on capturing the sparkling colors of the night sky and of the artificial lighting that was new to the era.

The station is located on the exclusive LRT right of way (adjacent to CPR ROW), 16.9 km south of the City Hall interlocking along Shawville Gate, to serve the Somerset, Bridlewood and Sundance communities, as well as the nearby Bishop O'Byrne High School and South Fish Creek Recreation Centre. It is one of two stations that also serve the Shawnessy Towne Centre shopping district. 913 parking spaces are included in the park-and-ride facility at the station. The station consists of a center-loading platform with at-grade crossings at both ends of the platform. The platform is also constructed to accommodate a four-car-length train. The station name was initially planned to be 162 Avenue Station. However, in late 2003 (approximately 7 months before opening) the City decided to use the current name for it. History The site of Somerset-Bridlewood was originally opened as 162nd Ave Station in spring of 1996 as a temporary platform on the CP-Rail line to provide access to a conventional rail service during peak rush hour periods to a platform at Anderson station. The service only lasted five months but the ridership proved popular and led to the priority decision to complete the South extension. The modern station was built on the site of the temporary platform when the CTrain service was extended south and re-opened as Somerset-Bridlewood on June 28, 2004. Two stub tracks are at the station, an indicator of a future extension to the Silverado development that is scheduled for an opening once there is sufficient development in the area to sustain LRT.2007 West LRT Report In 2005, the station registered an average of 10,100 boardings per weekday. In 2007, the station registered an average of 13,000 boardings per weekday.

Although rather small in size, the fountain is the best-known landmark of the city. Today, it is an essential part of graduation celebrations, for every student who finishes a doctorate at the University of G√∂ttingen has to climb the fountain and kiss the statue of the goose girl. Stadtportr√§t G√∂ttingen . Retrieved 2007-01-28. A G√§nseliesel is also situated in Monheim am Rhein, Hanover's Steintor Square and Berlin's Nikolsburger Square.  History  Since the 18th century, a fountain was located on the site of the G√§nseliesel. However, the old fountain was partially pulled down in the early 19th century due to deterioration. In 1898, the city council decided to construct a new fountain, for which sculptors from all over Germany presented their proposals. From all designs, the neo-gothical proposal \\"Im Geiste der Alten/Tugendbrunnen\\" (\\"In the Spirit of the Ancients/Fountain of Virtue\\") by the sculptors Mehs and Jehs was favoured while the goose girl design by the architect Heinrich St√∂ckhardt was only ranked second place. However, after the official ranking the three best designs were put on exhibition. The citizens of G√∂ttingen widely preferred the simpler design of the goose girl, probably because the simple girl image best represents the common people - in contrast to the numerous statues of famous university scientists found in the city. After long discussion, the G√§nseliesel, then designed by the architect Heinrich St√∂ckhardt and created by the sculptor Paul Nisse, was finally put up in 1901 without any official ceremony. The G√§nseliesel fountain does not have any particular connection to the history of the town. The Original of the sculpture is today in the Town Museum (St√§dtisches Museum) Traditions Soon after the fountain was erected, newly enrolled students of the Georgia Augusta university began to climb up the fountain and to kiss the statue which rapidly became a university tradition. Because the climbing of the fountain was usually celebrated with excessive consumption of alcohol and loud cheers of fellow students and because the number of students largely increased after World War I, police issued a decree in 1926 that officially forbade the climbing and kissing of the statue. A law student who was prosecuted for kissing the goose girl in the same year, took the case to court. However, the superior court of justice in Berlin legitimated the edict. The tradition itself has changed over time, and today it is unusual for first year students to kiss the statue; it is now more common to bring a bouquet of flowers to the G√§nseliesel and to give her a kiss after one's official reception of the doctorate degree. It is for this reason that the fountain is decorated with flowers very frequently, and throughout the year. Until recently, climbing and kissing of the monument remained officially forbidden although both the city of G√∂ttingen and the university advertise themselves with pictures of PhD graduates kissing the girl. As the fountain has been subject to vandalism, the original statue of the goose girl can today be seen in the Stadtmuseum while the fountain only carries a copy. After a severe assault during the winter of 2004 (malicious arson), the fountain needed to be disassembled and underwent major restoration. Since 1995, each year on a weekend in September the city of G√∂ttingen stages the so- called \\"G√§nselieselfest\\" in honor of the goose girl. Main event of these festivities is the election of a young woman from G√∂ttingen as the G√§nseliesel, representing the town and the statue for one year.

Development The system was developed by Toshiba as a replacement for the 75 mm M51 Skysweeper and M15A1 37 mm/12.7 mm anti-aircraft guns. Designed as a mobile short-range system to fill the performance gap between the FIM-92 Stinger man portable missile, and the larger MIM-23 Hawk missile system, which were both in service at the time. Development work began in 1966, with the first test firings conducted in 1978. The system was designated as the Type 81 by the JSDF, and contracts were placed for the system in 1980. The system entered service in 1981. In 1987, minor changed system SAM-1B was designated. Development work on an upgrade designated Tan-SAM Kai started in 1989. Defence White Paper 1989 Upgraded system was designated as SAM-1C in 1995, initial production on upgrade kits for the system starting in 1996. Two fire units were scheduled to be upgraded in 2000, with work on the program continuing into 2006. Development work on an upgrade designated Tan-SAM Kai II started in 2005. In 2014, the new type of short-range surface-to-air missile designated as Type 11 was officially unveiled, which as Tan-SAM Kai II research & development results, would replace the Type 81. Description The tripod-mounted optical tracking unit The Tan-SAM 1 missile is cruciform in cross section with four clipped delta wings attached to the mid body, and four small steerable clipped delta fins at the rear of the missile. The missile is propelled by a solid rocket motor, with giving it a burn-out velocity of about Mach 2.4. It is initially inertially guided to a likely intercept point, with an all-aspect infra-red seeker taking over to handle terminal guidance. The missile has a 9.2-kilogram fragmentation warhead triggered either by contact or a radar proximity fuze with a lethal radius of between 5 and 15 meters depending on the target type. A fire unit consists of one Fire Control System vehicle and two launcher vehicles as well as a number of support vehicles with a total crew of fifteen men. The Fire Control Systems vehicle consists of an Isuzu Motors 6√ó6 truck with a 30 kW generator unit mounted behind the driver's cabin, and a rectangular three-dimensional pulse-doppler phased array radar. The radar can operate in three modes: omni-directional search, sector search/course tracking mode, and fine tracking mode. The radar is scanned both mechanically and electronically and can track up to six targets within the same 110-degree arc in course tracking mode. Two targets can be tracked in fine tracking mode at greater accuracy, with the single-shot kill probability for each target relayed to the operator via a CRT display. The radar has a range of about 30 kilometers, and has built in IFF capabilities. Information on the two selected targets is then passed to the two attached launcher units, which are also mounted on Isuzu Motors 6√ó6 trucks, which slew and elevate their launchers toward the target. The launchers can be deployed up to 300 meters away from the Fire Control System vehicle. An intercept course is computed for the missile, and the missile is launched. The missile follows the initial inertial course until it reaches a pre-programmed point where it activates its infrared seeker. The infrared seeker only scans a programmed area of the sky to prevent it from locking onto the sun. From that point it switches to passive infrared homing for the terminal phase of the flight. The infrared seeker does not use IR filters to reject decoys, although there is a degree of protection provided by the use of intermediate frequency seeker scanning pattern. Each launcher is equipped with an optical director than can be used instead of the radar in a high ECM environment or if the radar is not operational; additionally the vehicle can be mounted with one or two 12.7 mm calibre heavy machine guns, for self-defense in frontal forward areas against ground threats and close-in(<500 m) incoming air threats. The system can be set up in approximately 30 minutes, and the launcher reload time for all four missiles is around three minutes. SAM-1C upgraded missile use a phased array active radar seeker, with the capability of receiving mid-course guidance updates from the Fire Control Systems vehicle. The upgrade also increases the missiles maximum range to 14 kilometers while increasing the missile weight to 105 kilograms. A new smokeless motor with improved thrust is also fitted, replacing the existing motor. Also the Fire Control Systems vehicle is fitted with a thermal imager to improve operation in an ECM heavy environment. Deployment The system is currently deployed by the JGSDF, JASDF and JMSDF with 57 fire units serving with the ground force (out of an initial requirement for 76), 30 serving with the air force, and 6 serving with the maritime force.

The reservoir sits in the foothills above the town on the western side of the Dakota Hogback, which contains the reservoir along its eastern side. The reservoir runs north-south for approximately 6.5 miles (10 km) and is approximately one-half mile (1 km) wide. It was constructed in 1949 by the Bureau of Reclamation as part of its federal Colorado-Big Thompson Project or \\"C-BT\\". Water distribution is currently managed by Reclamation and operated by the Northern Colorado Water Conservancy District. Horsetooth and Carter Lake serve as the two principal reservoirs for water diverted eastward under the continental divide via the C-BT. The reservoir is a supplementary source of municipal water for Fort Collins, Greeley and other communities in the region, as well as for irrigation in the lower South Platte River basin. The reservoir takes its name from Horsetooth Mountain, a summit in the foothills west of the southern end of the reservoir. History The construction of the reservoir inundated the community of Stout. Prior to construction, the majority of the town moved to a location that today surrounds Horsetooth's South Bay, but a few building foundations, including that of the old school house, are now under water. The reservoir has a capacity of , a total shoreline of 25 miles (40 km). The reservoir is located roughly at . In recent history the reservoir has experienced relatively low water levels; however, in June 2014, it reached 98.6% of its capacity, the highest it had been in four years. Dams Horsetooth Reservoir was created by the construction of four separate large earthen dams, all completed in 1949 and all modernized with a seismic retrofit in 2000-2004.http://www.usbr.gov/projects/Facility.jsp?fac_Name=Dixon+Canyon+Dam&groupName;=Overview The four dams, listed from north to south, are: * Horsetooth Dam, which closes the northern end of the reservoir, with a height of 155 feet, * Soldier Canyon Dam, 226 feet high, * Dixon Canyon Dam, 240 feet high, * Spring Canyon Dam, 220 feet high. Together the dams contain more than 10 million cubic yards of earthfill. Recreation and conservation The reservoir is a popular recreation destination for the region. According to a recent study conducted by the Bureau of Reclamation and the recreation manager at Horsetooth, Larimer County Parks and Open Lands, approximately 570,000 visitors come to Horsetooth every year. Larimer County has provided recreation management at Horsetooth, which is surrounded by 1,900 acres of public lands, and three other C-BT reservoirs since they opened in the early 1950s. Recreational boating is popular during summer months and swimming is allowed at the designated Swim Beach maintained by LCPOL as well as in some of the coves. Kayaking and canoeing is also popular. Fishing is also highly popular from boats or from shore, but is no longer allowed from the dams due to security concerns. Since the late 1960s, the sport of bouldering has become an established climbing pastime at the reservoir as the hard Dakota sandstone provides many challenging problems for both American and foreign athletes. However cliff diving is prohibited in all areas of the reservoir due to safety concerns. Park rangers patrol the reservoir for violators to keep everyone enjoying the reservoirs safely. Road cycling around Horsetooth has also become popular as has hiking and mountain biking, particularly along the Foothills Trail that traverses the reservoir's eastern edge. The City of Fort Collins maintains several open spaces directly below the reservoir and the state-owned Lory State Park is along the reservoir's northwestern shore. Other ridge lines surrounding the reservoir have become the site of residential development in recent decades, with structures ranging from get-away-cabins to luxury homes.

History Hyperpyron of Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143‚Äì1180), showing its typical scyphate (cup-shaped) form. The traditional gold currency of the Byzantine Empire had been the solidus or nomisma, whose gold content had remained steady at 24 carats for seven centuries and was consequently highly prized. From the 1030s, however, the coin was increasingly debased, until in the 1080s, following the military disasters and civil wars of the previous decade, its gold content was reduced to almost zero.. Consequently, in 1092, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos ( 1081‚Äì1118) undertook a drastic overhaul of the Byzantine coinage system and introduced a new gold coin, the hyperpyron (meaning \\"super-refined\\"). This was of the same standard weight (4.45 grams) as the solidus, but of less gold content (20.5 carats/4.1 grams instead of 24/4.8 grams) due to the recycling of earlier debased coins.; . The hyperpyron remained the standard gold coin until gold coins ceased to be minted by the Byzantines in the mid-14th century. It too, however, was subject to gradual debasement: under the Empire of Nicaea (1204‚Äì1261), its gold content fell gradually to 18 carats, under Michael VIII Palaiologos ( 1259‚Äì1282) to 15 and under his son and successor Andronikos II Palaiologos ( 1282‚Äì1328) to 12 carats. At the same time, the quality of the coins declined as well, and in the 14th century, their weight was far from uniform.. The last hyperpyra, and thus the last Byzantine gold coins, were struck by Emperor John VI Kantakouzenos ( 1347‚Äì1352). The name remained in use thereafter solely as a money of account, divided into 24 keratia.; . The name was adopted in various forms by Western Europeans (, ) and the Slavic countries of the Balkans (perper, iperpero, etc.) designating various coins, usually silver, as well as moneys of account.. More often in the West the hyperpyron was called the bezant, especially among Italian merchants. In the early Komnenian period, the hyperpyron was the equivalent of three electrum trachea, 48 billon trachea or 864 copper tetartera, although with the debasement of the trachea it eventually came to rate 12 electrum trachea and 288 to 384 billon trachea.. In the 14th century, the hyperpyron equalled 12 of the new silver basilika, 96 tournesia, 384 copper trachea and 768 copper assaria..

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. 2 Dec. 2007 read online Form criticism seeks to determine a unit's original form and the historical context of the literary tradition. Hermann Gunkel (1862-1932), Martin Noth, Gerhard von Rad, and other scholars originally developed form criticism for Old Testament studies; they used it to supplement the documentary hypothesis with reference to its oral foundations.Cross, F. L., ed. The Oxford dictionary of the Christian church. New York: Oxford University Press. 2005 Karl Ludwig Schmidt, Martin Dibelius (1883-1947) and Rudolf Bultmann later applied form criticism to the Gospels. Over the past few decades, form criticism's emphasis on oral tradition has waned in Old Testament studies. This is largely because scholars are increasingly skeptical about the ability to distinguish the \\"original\\" oral traditions from the literary sources that preserve them. As a result, the method as applied to the Old Testament now focuses on the Bible's literary genres, becoming virtually synonymous with genre criticism. Literary forms and sociological contexts Form criticism begins by identifying a text's genre or conventional literary form, such as parables, proverbs, epistles, or love poems. It goes on to seek the sociological setting for each text's genre, its \\"situation in life\\" (German: Sitz im Leben). For example, the sociological setting of a law is a court, or the sociological setting of a psalm of praise (hymn) is a worship context, or that of a proverb might be a father-to-son admonition. Having identified and analyzed the text's genre-pericopes, form criticism goes on to ask how these smaller genre-pericopes contribute to the purpose of the text as a whole.  The Evangelists  Studies based on form criticism state that the Evangelists drew upon oral traditions when composing the canonical gospels. This oral tradition consisted of several distinct components. Parables and aphorisms are the \\"bedrock of the tradition.\\" Pronouncement stories, scenes that culminate with a saying of Jesus, are more plausible historically than other kinds of stories about Jesus. Other sorts of stories include controversy stories, in which Jesus is in conflict with religious authorities; miracles stories, including healings, exorcisms, and nature wonders; call and commissioning stories; and legends.Schmidt, K. L. (1919). Der Rahmen der Geschichte Jesu. Berlin: Paternoster.Dibelius, M. (1919). Die Formgeschichte des Evangelium 3d Ed. G√ºnter Bornkamm (ed). T√ºbingen: J. C. B. Mohr.Bultmann, R. (1921). Die Geschichte der synoptischen Tradition. G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck und Ruprecht. The oral model developed by the form critics drew heavily on contemporary theory of Jewish folkloric transmission of oral material, and as a result of this form criticism one can trace the development of the early gospel tradition.http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_tradition_bailey.html However, \\"Today it is no exaggeration to claim that a whole spectrum of main assumptions underlying Bultmann's Synoptic Tradition must be considered suspect.\\"Kelber, W.

Developed by of Germany, it first flew in 1984. The design is owned by Claudius Jr's son, Conrado, who founded Dornier Seawings AG (now Dornier Seawings) to continue work on the project after two previous firms, Claudius Dornier Aircraft and Dornier Composite Aircraft, both went into bankruptcy. Development of the aircraft was put on hold without any production Seastars being completed in 1991. Multiple attempts to put the Seastar into production, often as a joint venture with other aerospace companies, were made throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. However securing the necessary financing to proceed to the manufacturing phase proved challenging. After several false starts, in October 2009, Dornier Seawings announced that it was formally launching manufacturing of the type, although no aircraft were actually built. In November 2018 the company received US$170M in funding from its Chinese backers to construct a manufacturing facility and one prototype for flight, with production to follow in 2021. Development=Origins The first prototype, a proof-of-concept aircraft, using the metal wings from a Dornier Do 28 and with large struts bracing the wing to the sponsons, conducted its maiden flight from Hamburg on 17 August 1984. A second prototype, which was more representative of the definitive design, featured several alterations; these included the adoption of a new composite wing, which connected with a set of cabane struts to the fuselage only, and was a larger aircraft overall. On 24 April 1987, the second prototype made its first flight from Oberpfaffenhofen. Development work on the project came to a close in 1991. A total of three aircraft had been produced at this point. In 1990, a European certificate of airworthiness was received for the type; in 1991, American airworthiness was also granted to the Seastar. During the 1990s, the programme encountered severe organisational issues, including a lack of funding and backers who subsequently withdrew their participation.Lewis, Paul. \\"Seastar project could be sunk.\\" Flight International, 19 July 1995.\\"Dornier Seastar plans India restart.\\" Flight International, 18 February 1998. In November 1989, the company behind the Seastar, Claudius Dornier Aircraft, filed for bankruptcy, amid claims that the German government had failed to support the project. Prior to this, more than 50 options and letters of intent had been received for the type. In 1990, Dornier Composite Aircraft acquired the Seastar program, but this firm was also bankrupt within two years. As a result, a new company, Dornier Seastar, was formed to complete the aircraft's development and to produce the type, and began to seek partnerships with Asian companies to achieve this. In 1993, Dornier Seastar and a consortium of Malaysian investors signed a joint venture agreement, under which assembly of the Seastar was envisioned to take place at a factory in Malaysia within the following year. However, in July 1995, a company spokesperson stated that Dornier Seastar's Malaysian subsidiary would be shelved until further notice, due a lack of capital investment; it has been allegedly that investors were concerned about the technical and financial viability of the project, such as the acquisition of internationally recognised production certification in Malaysia.Lewis, Paul. \\"Tajudin Ramli: Malaysian Midas?.\\" Flight International, 6 December 1995. By the time of the withdrawal, all of the manufacturing tools, moulds and jigs to produce that aircraft had already been transferred to Penang, Malaysia, along with a prototype aircraft for sales demonstration purposes at Subang Airport, Selangor. Following the collapse of the Malaysian joint venture, Dornier Seastar promptly set about attracting new investors to finance the program into the manufacturing phase. While the company focused its search on the Asian market, representatives stated that they were considering relocating production of the type to another country; Dornier Seastar also dismissed claims that a further $100 million were required to complete development of the aircraft's design.\\"Dornier Seastar expects to find Asian backing.\\" Flight International, 16 August 1995. In early 1998, Dornier Seastar proposed the formation of a partnership with Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL), with the goal of producing the type as a joint venture. HAL confirmed that it was examining the viability for the Seastar in the Indian market.\\"Hindustan eyes a tie-up on Dornier Seastar amphibian.\\" Flight International, 24 February 1998. By 2003, one of the two Seastar prototypes had been restored and received public transport certification in December of that year. In February 2004, the company stated that, in addition to seeking investment, it had been evaluating potential manufacturing sites in Europe and Asia prior to initiating a planned development phase later that year.Wastnage, Justin. \\"Investors sought to bring Seastar back to market.\\" Flight International, 10 August 2004. It was said that feasibility studies and market analysis indicated that there was a global demand for around 250 such aircraft over the next ten years; furthermore, that it was proposing three different versions of the aircraft, each one for a different market segment: A surveillance variant for government agencies, a 12-seat regional airliner configuration aimed at charter operators, and a six-seat layout that was suited to VIP customers. In August 2006, there were claims made that the project was close to being relaunched with backing from firms in Singapore and Abu Dhabi, the latter being contingent upon the Seastar being manufactured in Abu Dhabi.\\"Seastar close to relaunch.\\" Flight International, 8 August 2006. In October 2008, the company announced its intentions to produce the Seastar in the US, in part due to favourable currency exchange rates.\\"NBAA 2008: Dornier plans to build revived Seastar in US.\\" Flight International, 6 October 2008. Fabrication was to be outsourced to other companies, and was intended to use mainly American suppliers. The firm viewed the aircraft as having a niche role among private owners, airlines, and search and rescue operators. Dornier Seawings stated that it was seeking an additional $150 million to bring the type into mass production; it was also said that, in the event of 25 or more sales being secured, the Seastart could be in production as early as March 2009.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Buoyancy returns to seaplane market.\\" Flight International, 10 October 2008. In March 2009, the firm stated that it was pushing back its planned launch to the third quarter of that year, attributing this to the effects of the Great Recession, but remained optimistic about market demand for the type; it was also said that Dornier required only an additional $65 million, rather than the $150 million figure given in an earlier business plan, to establish full production status and to begin manufacturing work.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Dornier pushes back Seastar amphibian aircraft relaunch.\\" Flight International, 17 March 2009. Production In October 2009, Dornier Seaplane announced that it would launch production of the Seastar. According to Dornier Seaplane chief executive Joe Walker, the aircraft had been well received by a variety of public and private operators, and had received more than 25 letters of intent to procure the Seastar; he also stated that 2010 would be dedicated to selecting a final assembly site and major suppliers for the aircraft's manufacturing, and the first aircraft was then scheduled to be rolled out by the end of 2011.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Dornier nears decision on Seastar final assembly base.\\" Flight International, 7 January 2010. In May 2010, Dornier Seaplane announced that it would build the Seastar in Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about half an hour away from Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The site was picked due to the strength of the local supply chain and presence of skilled aerospace workers, as well as its proximity to Lake Champlain for flight operations. At this point, the company aimed to deliver their first production aircraft in 2012; production was projected to rise from a single aircraft in 2012, to six in 2013 and to 12 in 2014; dependent on demand, as many as 50 Seastars per year could eventually be built.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Dornier Seaplane picks final assembly site for Seastar amphibian.\\" Flight International, 19 May 2010.Sarsfield, Kate. \\"Dornier closes in on manufacturers for Seastar.\\" Flight International, 23 July 2011.  Wuxi acquisition  In 2013, the Seastar was acquired by Chinese companies Wuxi Communications Industry and Wuxi Industrial Development with the Dornier family retaining a minority stake. The company became a joint venture with these two state-owned companies, and plans to produce the aircraft in two locations, with one site in Oberpfaffenhofen, Germany and another in Wuxi, China. In January 2016, Dornier Seaplane announced that Seastar airframes would be built by Diamond Aircraft Industries. In February 2016, Dornier launched the improved CD2. The first new-generation Seastar rolled out on 18 August 2017 in Oberpfaffenhoffen and is prepared for its first flight in the first half of 2019, for a 2020 type certification. It includes a redesigned and upgraded interior, Honeywell Primus Epic 2.0 avionics, a stern thruster, new Sumitomo corrosion-resistant landing gear, hydraulic electrically steerable nose gear, MT five-blade composite propellers and Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-135As. By November 2018, the Chinese shareholders invested ‚Ç¨150 million ($172 million) to develop and produce the CD2, to construct a new facility in Wuxi and to expand its Oberpfaffenhofen base, for a 2021 service entry. It first flew on 28 March 2020. Design Seastar, 2010 The Dornier Seastar is a parasol wing flying boat, powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-112 engines, mounted in a single nacelle over the wings in a push- pull configuration. In general layout, it strongly resembles both the innovative Dornier Wal all-metal monoplane flying boat of the 1920s, of which over 250 examples were built, and its direct successor, the larger Dornier Flugzeugwerke's Do 18 of the 1930s. Locating both of the engines in the center of the wing enables the weight of the engines to be more effective in reducing any induced rolling motions; it also protects the engines from water spray, reducing corrosion, and eliminates asymmetric thrust when operating. The Seastar's fuselage is composed of a fiberglass composite material, which is corrosion-proof as well as being less prone to leaks in comparison to rivetted metal hull counterparts. Unlike typical floatplanes, which are often conversions of land-based aircraft, the Seastar has a low vertical center of gravity, achieved in part by carrying all of its fuel within its sponsons instead of the wings.McClellan, J. Mac. \\"The Flying Boat is Back.\\" FLYING Magazine, 15 January 2010. The sponsons, which provide stability while submerged on the water, are shaped to break surface tension and to generate considerable lift during the acceleration performed during takeoff; they also accommodate the main landing gear. Other flying boats often retract the landing gear into the hull instead. The landing gear can be optionally removed and reinstalled when needed; a special 'water mode' for the landing gear is also present which prevents their deployment during a water-based landing. The hull of the Seastar features complex angling and shaping, as the result of extensive water tank testing. Pilots exit and enter the Seastar through a single door on the left-hand side of the aircraft from the sponson, and passengers board via a separate hatch located aft of the wing, also stepping from the sponson. This approach enables the aircraft to close to a relatively short distance from docks or boats for boarding purposes. The cabin can house up to 12 passengers, in addition to the crew in high-density seating, or can alternatively accommodate six-nine passengers in more spacious configurations; an aft baggage compartment is also present. A series of improvements have been projected for the aircraft, such as the integration of an autopilot to enable single-pilot operations. Other prospective improvements include the adoption of a glass cockpit, deicing equipment, and air conditioning systems. Early production aircraft are intended to be compatible with the retrofitting of these improvements later on. According to Dornier Seawings, for surveillance missions the Seastar's flight endurance can be extended to around 11 flight hours by cruising on only a single engine. It is also claimed that the Seastar is one of the fastest flying boats on the market.

A digital loop carrier (DLC) is a system which uses digital transmission to extend the range of the local loop farther than would be possible using only twisted pair copper wires. A DLC digitizes and multiplexes the individual signals carried by the local loops onto a single datastream on the DLC segment. Reasons for using DLCs Subscriber Loop Carrier systems address a number of problems: *Electrical constraints on long loops. *Insufficient available cable pairs. *Cable route congestion (inability to add cable due to lack of space, particularly in urban street, bridge, and building conduit) *Construction challenges (in areas of difficult terrain) when limited cable pairs are already available *Expense due to cable cost and the associated labour-intensive installation work (especially to solve the specific problems listed above) Long loops, such as those terminating at more than 18,000 feet (5.49 kilometres) from the central office, pose electrical challenges. When the subscriber goes off-hook, a cable pair behaves like a single loop inductance coil with a -48 V dc potential and an Electric current of between 20‚Äì50 mA dc. Electric current values vary with cable length and gauge. A minimum current of around 20 mA dc is required to convey terminal signalling information to the network. There is also a minimum power level required to provide adequate volume for the voice signal. A variety of schemes were implemented before DLC technology to offset the impedance long loops offered to signalling and volume levels. They included the following: *Use heavy-gauge conductors ‚Äì Up to 19 gauge (approximately the gauge of pencil lead), which is costly and bulky. The heavy-gauge cables yielded far fewer pairs per cable and led to early congestion in cable routes, especially in bridge crossings and other areas of limited space. *Increase battery voltage ‚Äì This violation of operating standards could pose a safety hazard. *Add amplifiers to power the voice signal on long loops. This requires volumes of auxiliary equipment, many cross wiring points and extensive record-keeping. *Add signal regeneration and signal extension equipment ‚Äì The comments regarding amplifiers apply here as well. *Add loading coils to reduce the attenuation of voice signals over long loops. These have detrimental effect to new transmission technologies using the local loop, like DSL, and must be removed. DLC eliminates the need for these remedies by extending closer to the customer the line card which digitises the voice signal for use by the PSTN. Once the voice signal is digitised, it is easily manipulated and is no longer subject to the vagaries of the analog loop caused by distance, impedance, attenuation and noise. The DLC solution was dubbed \\"pair gain\\" (from the days when DLC was deployed to recover copper pairs in the loop plant environment). Configuration In a typical configuration, DLC remote terminals are installed in new neighbourhoods or buildings as a means of reducing the labour and complexity of installing individual local loops from the customer to the central office (CO). A fibre optic cable or several copper pairs for the whole system from the CO to the DLC remote terminal replace the individual pair previously needed for each loop. DLC remote terminals are typically stored in Serving Area Interfaces‚Äìmetal cabinets alongside or near roadways that overlie communications rights-of-ways. With the growth in popularity of digital subscriber line (DSL) and the benefits provided by shorter metallic loops used with DLC systems, digital loop carriers are sometimes integrated with digital subscriber line access multiplexers (DSLAM), both systems then taking advantage of the digital transmission link from the DLC to the CO. Fibre in the loop (FITL) systems are functionally equivalent to DLC. FITL accomplishes the same two primary functions DLC was intended for: pair gain and the elimination of electrical constraints due to long metallic loops. FITL architectures vary from simply deploying fibre feeder plants (between central office and remote terminal site) to \\"fibre to the curb\\" and, ultimately \\"fibre to the home\\" where an optical network unit (ONU) is located at each home.

Beyond sports, the first Stagg Field (1893‚Äì1957) is remembered for its role in a landmark scientific achievement of Enrico Fermi and the Metallurgical Laboratory during the Manhattan Project. The site of the first artificial nuclear chain reaction, which occurred within the field's west viewing-stands structure, received designation as a National Historic Landmark on February 18, 1965. On October 15, 1966, which is the day that the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 was enacted creating the National Register of Historic Places, it was added to that as well. The site was named a Chicago Landmark on October 27, 1971. A Henry Moore sculpture, Nuclear Energy, in a small quadrangle commemorates the location of the nuclear experiment.Site of First Self-Sustaining Nuclear Reaction, NHL Database, National Historic Landmarks Program. Retrieved 11 February 2007. The University's current Stagg Field is located a few blocks away and reuses one of the original gates. First nuclear chain reaction Chicago Pile-1, the world's first artificial nuclear reactor, was built under the west stands of Stagg Field, which was by then no longer used for football. The first man-made self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction occurred on December 2, 1942. Sports venue=First Stagg Field The first Stagg Field was a stadium at the University of Chicago in Chicago. It was primarily used for college football games, and was the home field of the Maroons. Stagg Field originally opened in 1893 as Marshall Field, named after Marshall Field who donated land to the university to build the stadium.http://athletics.uchicago.edu/sports/fball/2017-18/media-guide In 1913, the field was renamed Stagg Field after their famous coach Amos Alonzo Stagg. The final capacity, after several stadium expansions, was 50,000. The University of Chicago discontinued its football program after 1939 and left the Big Ten Conference in 1946. The stadium was demolished in 1957, and much of the stadium site was used as the site of Regenstein Library.Marshall Field c.1900 before the construction of the permanent stadium seating. Note: Bartlett Gymnasium has not been erected at the time of this photo. In addition to Maroons football, the stadium hosted other events. These include the 1893, 1898, 1913, 1923 and 1933 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, a regional qualifying meet for the US Olympic Trials for Track and Field held June 19‚Äì20, 1936 and the NCAA Men's Track and Field Championships in 1921, 1922, 1923, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1933, and 1936. Northwestern also played a number of home games at Stagg Field. At the turn of the 20th century, Northwestern was unable to handle large crowds, so they hosted then-powerhouse Minnesota at Marshall Field for a 1901 game and a 1904 game. In 1925 (a year prior to the opening of Dyche Stadium) Northwestern again was unable to accommodate large crowds, and as a result played two games at Stagg Field. The first was a notable win over Michigan. The second was an October 24 game against Tulane that had originally been scheduled to be played at Soldier Field instead. Tulane won the game at Stagg Field 18-7. The University of Michigan fight song \\"The Victors\\" was written by Michigan music student Louis Elbel in 1898, following a last minute 12-11 Michigan victory over the University of Chicago at Stagg Field for the Western Conference championship. New Stagg Field Stagg Field in 2013 The current Stagg Field is an athletic field located several blocks to the northwest that preserves the Stagg Field name, as well as a relocated gate from the original facility. The school's current Division III football team uses the new field as their home. It is also home to the Chicago Maroons soccer, softball and outdoor track teams. Stagg Field has a seating capacity of 1,650, and the playing surface is made of FieldTurf.

Many of her works were written for young readers. She was the chairperson of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles. Her pen name Bing Xin (literally \\"Ice Heart\\") carries the meaning of a morally pure heart, and is taken from a line in a Tang Dynasty poem by Wang Changling.  Life  Bing Xin was born in Fuzhou, Fujian, but moved to Shanghai with her family when she was seven months old, and later moved yet again to the coastal port city of Yantai, Shandong, when she was four. Such a move had a crucial influence on Bing Xin's personality and philosophy of love and beauty, as the vastness and beauty of the sea greatly expanded and refined young Bing Xin's mind and heart. It was also in Yantai Bing Xin first began to read the classics of Chinese literature, such as Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin, when she was just seven. In 1913, Bing Xin moved to Beijing. The May Fourth Movement in 1919 inspired and elevated Bing Xin's patriotism to new high levels, starting her writing career as she wrote for a school newspaper at Yanjing University where she was enrolled as a student and published her first novel. While at Yanjing in 1921, Bing Xin was baptized a Christian, but was throughout her life generally indifferent to Christian rituals. Bing Xin graduated from Yanjing University in 1923 with a bachelor's degree, and went to the United States to study at Wellesley College, earning a master's degree at Wellesley in literature in 1926. She then returned to Yanjing University to teach until 1936. In 1929, she married Wu Wenzao, an anthropologist and her good friend when they were studying in the United States. Together, Bing Xin and her husband visited different intellectual circles around the world, communicating with other intellectuals such as Virginia Woolf. In 1940, Bing Xin was elected a member of the National Senate.James Z. Gao: Historical Dictionary of Modern China (1800-1949) Later in her life, Bing Xin taught in Japan for a short period and stimulated more cultural communications between China and the other parts of the world as a traveling Chinese writer. In literature, Bing Xin founded the \\"Bing Xin Style\\" as a new literary style. She contributed a lot to children's literature in China (her writings were even incorporated into children's textbooks), and also undertook various translation tasks, including the translation of the works of Indian literary figure Rabindranath Tagore. Bing Xin's literary career was prolific and productive. She wrote a wide range of works--prose, poetry, novels, reflections, etc. Her career spanned more than seven decades in length, from 1919 to the 1990s.

After the Japanese annexation of Korea in 1910, Korea's domestic resistance peaked in the March 1st Movement, which was crushed and sent Korean leaders to flee into China. In China, Korean independence activists built ties with the National Government of the Republic of China which supported the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea (KPG), as a government in exile. At the same time, the Korean Liberation Army, which operated under the Chinese National Military Council and then the KPG, led attacks against Japan. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, China became one of the Allies of World War II. In the Second Sino-Japanese War, China attempted to use this influence to assert Allied recognition of the KPG. However, the United States was skeptical of Korean unity and readiness for independence, preferring an international trusteeship-like solution for the Korean Peninsula. Although China achieved agreement by the Allies on eventual Korean independence in the Cairo Declaration of 1943, continued disagreement and ambiguity about the postwar Korean government lasted until the Soviet‚ÄìJapanese War created a de facto division of Korea into Soviet and American zones, prompting the Korean War. The date of the Surrender of Japan is an annual holiday called Gwangbokjeol (\\"Restoration of Light Day\\") in South Korea, and Chogukhaebang≈≠i nal (\\"Fatherland Liberation Day\\") in North Korea. History=Before Japanese occupation of Korea The last independent Korean monarchy, the Joseon dynasty, lasted over 500 years (1392‚Äì1910), both as the Joseon Kingdom and later as the Empire of Korea. Its international status and policies were conducted primarily through careful diplomacy with the power en vogue in China (during this period of time dynastic control of China saw the end of the Yuan dynasty and the rise and fall of both the Ming dynasty and the Qing dynasty), though other interactions with other international entities were not absent. Through this maneuvering and a dedicated adherence to strict Neo-Confucianist foreign and domestic policies, Joseon Korea retained control over its internal affairs and relative international autonomy though technically a suzerain of the ruling Chinese dynasties for most of this period. These policies were effective in maintaining Korea's relative independence and domestic autonomy in spite of a number of regional upheavals and a number of invasions (including the Japanese invasions of Korea from 1592‚Äì98 as well as the First and Second Manchu invasions of Korea). However, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the rise of Western imperialism boosted by the Industrial Revolution and other major international trends, the weakening of China also made Korea vulnerable to foreign maneuvering and encroachment, both as a target in and of itself and as a stepping-stone to the \\"larger prize\\" of China. This period (roughly from 1870 until annexation by Japan in 1910) was marked in Korea by major upheavals, many intrigues, the inability of Joseon Korea and the later Empire of Korea to right itself amidst all of the maneuvering around it by larger powers (including, but not limited to, Imperial Russia, Japan, China, and to a lesser extent France, Great Britain, and the United States), revolts/insurrections, and other indicators of a turbulent time. By the end of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1895 it was evident internationally that China could no longer protect its international interests, much less its own, against its opponents, and that its attempts to modernize its military and institutions were unsuccessful. Among other things, the Treaty of Shimonoseki that ended this war stipulated that China would relinquish suzerainty and influence over Korea, recognize Korea's full independence and autonomy, and end the tribute system which had linked China and Korea for many centuries. In practical reality, this stipulation implied the handover of primary foreign influence in Korea from China to Japan, as Japanese forces had taken positions in the Korean Peninsula during the course of the war. This paved the way for Imperial Japan to tighten its influence on Korea without official Chinese intervention. In 1905, the Eulsa Treaty made the Empire of Korea (Korean imperial status had been established in 1897 to put King Gojong on equal legal footing with his neighboring sovereigns and to fully sever Korea's superficial ties of suzerainty to China) a protectorate of Japan; in 1907, the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1907 stipulated that Korea's policies would be enacted and enforced under the guidance of the Japanese resident general; and in 1910, through the Japan‚ÄìKorea Annexation Treaty, Japan officially declared its annexation of Korea, a move for which Japan had been preparing for an extended period of time. All of these treaties were procured under duress,\\"McKenzie FA. Korea's Fight for Freedom. 1920\\" and though under duress, Emperor Sunjong of Korea refused to sign any of them and considered them illegal and not binding (though he had no real power to oppose its enactment and enforcement). Notably, both the 1905 treaty (and by extension the 1907 treaty) and the 1910 annexation treaty were declared \\"already null and void\\" when the normalization of relations between the Republic of Korea and Japan was negotiated in 1965.Hook, Glenn D. (2001). Japanese rule The Japanese rule that ensued was oppressive to a far-reaching degree, giving rise to many Korean resistance movements. By 1919 these became nationwide, marked by what became known as the March 1st Movement. Japanese rule was oppressive but changed over time. Initially, there was very harsh repression in the decade following annexation. Japan's rule was markedly different than in its other colony, Formosa. This period is called \\"amhukki\\", the dark period by Koreans. Tens of thousands of Koreans were arrested for political reasons. The harshness of Japanese rule increased support for the Korean independence movement. Many Koreans left the Korean Peninsula, some of whom formed resistance groups and societies in Manchuria to fight for Korean independence. Koreans also carried out armed struggles against the Japanese. In the 1920s, Korean independence army units engaged in resistance activities in Manchuria and the Maritime Provinces of Siberia. Some went to Japan, where groups agitated clandestinely. There was a prominent group of Korean Communists in Japan, who were in danger for their political activities. Partly due to Korean opposition to colonial policies, this was followed by a relaxation of some harsh policies. The Korean crown prince married the Japanese princess Nashimoto. The ban on Korean newspapers was lifted, allowing publication of Choson Ilbo and The Dong-a Ilbo. Korean government workers received the same wages as Japanese officials, though the Japanese officials received bonuses the Koreans did not. Whippings were eliminated for minor offenses but not for others. Laws interfering with burial, slaughtering of animals, peasant markets, or traditional customs were removed or changed. After the Peace Preservation Law of 1925, some freedoms were restricted. Then, in the lead up to the invasion of China and World War II, the harshness of Japanese rule increased again. World War II diplomacy Although the Empire of Japan had invaded and occupied northeast China from 1931, the Nationalist Government of China tried to avoid declaring war against Japan until the Empire directly attacked Beijing in 1937, sparking the Second Sino-Japanese War. After the United States declared war on Japan in 1941, China became an Ally of World War II, and tried to exercise its influence within the group to support Asian anticolonialist nationalism, which included the demand of the complete surrender of Japan and immediate independence of Korea afterwards. China tried to promote the legitimacy of the Provisional Government of Korea (KPG), which was established by Koreans in China after the suppression of the March 1st Movement in Korea. The KPG was ideologically aligned with the Chinese government of the time, as independence leader Kim Gu had agreed to Chiang Kai-shek's suggestion to adopt the Chinese Three Principles of the People program in exchange for financial aid. At the same time, China supported the leftist independence leader Kim Won-bong and convinced the two Kims to form the unified Korean Liberation Army (KLA). Under the terms in which the KLA was allowed to operate in China, it became an auxiliary of China's National Revolutionary Army until 1945. China's National Military Council had also decided that \\"complete independence\\" for Korea was China's fundamental Korean policy; otherwise, the government in Chongqing tried to unify the warring Korean factions. Although Chiang and Korean leaders like Syngman Rhee tried to influence the US State Department to support Korean independence and recognize the KPG, the Far Eastern Division was skeptical. Its argument was that the Korean people \\"were emasculated politically\\" after decades of Japanese rule, and showed too much disunity, preferring a condominium solution for Korea that involved the Soviets. China was adamantly opposed to Soviet influence in Korea after hearing about Soviet atrocities in Poland since its \\"liberation\\". By the Cairo Conference, the US and China came to agree on Korean independence \\"in due course\\", with China still pressing for immediate recognition of the exile government and a tangible date for independence. After Soviet-American relations deteriorated, on August 10, 1945 the United States Department of War agreed that China should land troops in Pusan, Korea from which to prevent a Soviet takeover. However, this turnaround was too late to prevent the division of Korea, as the Red Army quickly occupied northern Korea that same month. Ideologies and concerns Although there were many separate movements against colonial rule, the main ideology or purpose of the movement was to free Korea from the Japanese military and political rule. Koreans were concerned with alien domination and Korea‚Äôs state as a colony. They desired to restore Korea's independent political sovereignty after Japan invaded the weakened and partially modernized Korean Empire. This was the result of Japan's political maneuvers to secure international approval for the annexation of treaty annexing Korea. During the independence movement, the rest of the world viewed Korea's resistance movement as a racial anti- imperialist, anti-militarist rebellion, and an anti-Japanese resistance movement. Koreans, however, saw the movement as a step to free Korea from the Japanese military rule. The South Korean government has been criticized as recently as 2011 for not accepting Korean socialists who fought for Korean independence. Tactics There was no main strategy or tactic that was prevalent throughout the resistance movement, but there were prominent stages where certain tactics or strategies were prominent. From 1905 to 1910, most of the movement‚Äôs activities were closed off to the elite class or rare scholar. During this time, militaristic and violent attempts were taken to resist the Japanese including assassination. Most of the attempts were disorganized, scattered, and leaderless to prevent arrests and surveillance by Japan. From 1910 to 1919, was a time of education during the colonial era. Many Korean textbooks on grammar and spelling were circulated in schools. It started the trend of intellectual resistance to the Japanese rule. This period, along with Woodrow Wilson‚Äôs progressive principles, created an aware, nationalist, and eager student population. After the March 1st movement of 1919, strikes became prominent in the movement. Up to 1945, universities were used as a haven and source of students who further supported the movement. This support system led to the improvement of school facilities. From 1911 to 1937, Korea was dealing with economic problems (with the rest of the world, going through the Great Depression after World War I). There were many labor complaints that contributed to the grievances against Japan‚Äôs colonial rule. During this period, there were 159,061 disputes with workers concerned with wages and 1018 disputes involving 68,686 farmers in a tenant position. In 1926 the disputes started to increase at a fast pace and movements concerning labor emerged more within the Independence Movement. Types of movements There were broadly three kinds of national liberation groups: (a) the Christian groups which grew out of missionary efforts led by Western missionaries primarily from the United States prior to the Japanese occupation; (b) the former military and the irregular army groups; and (c) business and intellectual expatriates who formed the theoretical and political framework abroad. Religious groups Koreans brought Catholicism to Korea towards the end of the 18th century and faced intense persecution. Methodist and Presbyterian missionaries followed in the 19th century starting off a renaissance with more liberal thoughts on issues of equality and woman's rights, which the strict Confucian tradition would not permit. The early Korean Christian missionaries both led the Korean independence from 1890 through 1907, and later the creation of a Korean liberation movement from 1907 to 1945. Korean Christians suffered martyrdoms, crucifixions, burnings to death, police interrogations and massacres by the Japanese. Amongst the major religious nationalist groups were: * Korean Presbyterian church * March 1 Movement * Korean YMCA and in World War II. * Donghak Peasant Revolution: Donghak armies were spontaneous countryside uprisings, originally against corruption in the late Joseon dynasty, and later, against Japanese confiscation of lands in Korea. * Righteous army: Small armies that fought Japanese military police, cavalry and infantry most intensely from 1907‚Äì1918, but which carried on till the end of World War II. *Greater Korea Independence Army () *Northern Military Administration Office Army () *Greater Korea Independence Corps () *Korea Revolution Army () *Korea Independence Army () *Korean Volunteer Corps () *Korean Volunteer Army () *Korean Liberation Army: The Armed Forces of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea, took part in allied action in China and parts of Southern East Asia such as Burma. *Korean Patriotic Legion () Supporters of these groups included French, Czech, Chinese and Russian arms merchants, as well as Chinese nationalist movements. Expatriate groups Expatriate liberation groups were active in Shanghai, northeast China, parts of Russia, Hawaii, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. Groups were even organised in areas without many expatriate Koreans, such as the one established in 1906 in Colorado by Park Hee Byung. The culmination of expatriate success was the Shanghai declaration of independence. * Korean National Army Corps (), founded in June 1914. (Hawaii) * Korean National Association () * Young Korean Academy () Sun Yat- sen was an early supporter of Korean struggles against Japanese invaders. By 1925, Korean expatriates began to cultivate two-pronged support in Shanghai: from Chiang Kai-Shek's Kuomintang, and from early communist supporters, who later branched into the Communist Party of China. Little real support came through, but that which did developed long standing relationships that contributed to the dividing of Korea after 1949, and the polar positions between south and north. Royalist influence The constant infighting within the Yi family, the nobles, the confiscation of royal assets, the disbanding of the royal army by the Japanese, the execution of seniors within Korea by Japan, and comprehensive assassinations of Korean royalty by Japanese mercenaries, led to great difficulties in royal descendants and their family groups in finding anything but a partial leadership within the liberation movement. A good many of the righteous army commanders were linked to the family but these generals and their righteous army groups were largely eliminated by 1918; and cadet members of the families contributed towards establishing both republics post-1945.

Biography=Early life and career Greene was born in Cumberland, Maryland, the son of future U.S. Army General George S. Greene. He entered the United States Naval Academy on September 21, 1855, and graduated on June 9, 1859, with the rank of midshipman. He was stationed on the steam sloop , which transported John Elliott Ward, the American ambassador to various cities in China to settle American claims. Civil War When the Civil War broke out, the Hartford was ordered to return home. Greene, having been promoted to lieutenant on August 31, 1861, arrived in Philadelphia on December 2, 1861. After a short leave, he volunteered for duty on the Monitor. Greene was appointed executive officer, serving under Commander Lieutenant John L. Worden during its historic four-hour battle at Hampton Roads, Virginia, with the Confederate ironclad warship on March 9, 1862. During the battle he assumed full command of Monitor when Worden was temporarily blinded by shell fragments from an explosion from one of Virginias broadsides. After the subsequent retreat and assessment of all damage Greene ordered the return to battle and continued engaging the Virginia to a standoff.Davis, 1981, p.132-133Baxter, 1933, p.294 Greene continued to command the Monitor until Thomas O. Selfridge, Jr. took command on March 10, 1862. From April to May 1862 Greene continued to serve as executive officer on Monitor during the Battle of Drewry's Bluff on the James River, Virginia, and later provided naval support for General McClellan's forces on land along that river. Greene was aboard the ship when it foundered in a gale 20 miles off Cape Hatteras on December 31 ‚Äì January 1, 1863, which Greene survived after being pulled into a lifeboat by the ship's surgeon, Dr. Grenville M. Weeks.Davis, 1981, p.160-164 In 1863 Greene served aboard the gunboat on the blockade of North Carolina, then in 1864‚Äì1865 aboard the sloop , under the command of Christopher R. P. Rodgers, sailing around South America and across the Pacific to Singapore in search of the Confederate raider . Post-war career Greene was promoted to Lieutenant Commander on August 11, 1865, and served as instructor of mathematics at the Naval Academy from 1866 to 1868. From 1868 to 1871 he served in the Pacific Squadron, aboard the sloops and , and the screw steamer . He served as the head of the department of astronomy, navigation and surveying at the Naval Academy from 1871 to 1875, receiving promotion to Commander on December 12, 1872. Greene commanded the and between 1875 and 1878, was assistant superintendent of the Academy from 1878 to 1882, then commanded the in 1883-1884. Greene was serving as the executive officer of the Portsmouth Navy Yard when on December 11, 1884 at the age of 45, he committed suicide at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and was buried in Bristol, Rhode Island.Davis, 1981, p. 168 Namesake The destroyer (1919‚Äì1945) was named for him.

It is officially named the Blecher-Freeman Memorial Causeway after two California Highway Patrol officers who were killed in the line of duty on the causeway. History Ferry service was usually required to cross the Yolo Bypass basin during seasonal flooding; the first county seat of Yolo County was the town of Fremont, built near the ferry crossing near the confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers. Fremont was wiped out during the floods of 1851. As an alternative, settlers established the Yolo Plankroad, which was a long route that ended close to present-day Woodland, California. Before a causeway was built, wheeled vehicles between Davis and Sacramento were forced to detour south through Tracy and Stockton during seasonal flooding. Once the ground was sufficiently dry to support vehicle traffic, the first vehicle to make it across the Yolo Bypass established the seasonal \\"Tule Jake\\" Road, which was typically passable only during the summer months. 1916 causeway An artist's representation of the original Yolo Causeway. Circa 1920. The original Yolo Causeway opened on 18 March 1916 as a two-lane structure wide and long, connecting what is now the city of West Sacramento with Davis, California. Residents celebrated with the four day-long Causeway Celebration, held from May 11‚Äì14, 1916. Initially, the causeway was composed of a timber trestle section ( long, on the west) and a concrete trestle section (remaining length), with a plate girder bascule span, which was opened to permit passage of levee maintenance barges. The causeway width was doubled in 1933 when a new all-timber viaduct was added just south of the 1916 reinforced concrete structure; lights were added in 1950. The Lincoln Highway association initially declined to shift its route to take advantage of the Yolo Causeway, but in 1928, following the completion of the Carquinez Bridge, it was made a part of the re-routed Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. Later, the causeway became a part of US Highways 40 and 99W. 1962 causeway The current causeway was built in 1962. From west to east, the causeway is composed of twinned long concrete trestles, a long earth fill segment, and twinned long concrete trestles. The easternmost of the two bridges is the longer of the two and traffic reporters will sometimes refer to the two structures as the \\"long bridge\\" and the \\"short bridge\\". Each trestle carries a wide, three-lane roadway. It was renamed the \\"Blecher- Freeman Memorial Causeway\\" in 1994, after two California Highway Patrol officers who were shot to death in 1978 after a highway stop near the causeway. Proposed improvements I-80 travels over the Yolo Causeway, on the right hand side of the photograph In 2018, Caltrans announced plans to extend the carpool lane along I-80 from Solano County to Sacramento County, which includes plans to widen the causeway to four lanes in each direction. The proposed widening would not start until at least 2024, and the project is estimated to cost $800 million. One proposed alternative would use the extra lane as a toll lane. Bypass The Yolo Bypass protects Sacramento and other California Central Valley communities from flooding. During wet seasons, it can be full of water. It contains the Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area, the largest ecological restoration project west of the Everglades. Other nature preserves in it include the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area and Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. The Yolo Bypass begins at the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area, located approximately northwest of Sacramento and lying south of the Sacramento River, upstream from its confluence with the Feather River. When seasonal rains cause the river to rise, water is diverted via the concrete Fremont Weir into the Yolo Bypass floodplain. The Yolo Bypass can carry up to five times the capacity of the Sacramento River, preventing it from flooding Sacramento. The diverted water re-enters the Sacramento River delta near Rio Vista. A 2002 study showed that water begins to flow from the Sacramento into the Fremont Weir when the flow reaches approximately ; for comparison, the capacity of the Yolo Bypass is . Bats fly out from under the Yolo Causeway (2018) Approximately 250,000 Mexican free-tailed bats migrate to the Yolo Causeway every June. They roost in the expansion joints between the causeway segments, and feed on the insects that live in the wetlands formed by the Yolo Bypass. Cultural influence The Causeway Classic is named after the causeway, and refers to the annual college football game between the Aggies of the University of California, Davis and the Hornets of California State University, Sacramento.

The company, owned by the Yung family, owns and operates hotels in various parts of the United States. The current president and founder is William J. Yung III. Current portfolio , the company operates 40 hotels under 3 different major brands and many sub-brands consisting of 30 full- service Marriotts including 1 JW Marriott and 3 Renaissance Hotels and 1 limited service Courtyard by Marriott, 2 Hyatt Regency Hotels, 2 Westin Hotels, and 5 Hiltons including the Boulders Resort which is formerly a Waldorf Astoria property now operating under Hilton's Curio brand and 1 DoubleTree Hotel. The Westin Dawn Beach in Sint Maarten is currently not in operation due to damage from Hurricane Irma; however, the adjacent timeshare buildings have been repaired and re-opened in December 2018. Peak At its peak in 2007, Columbia Sussex owned 86 hotels with 32,604 rooms and 13 casinos. The majority of the portfolio was lost during the great recession between 2008 and 2012. Included in the rooms lost by Columbia Sussex are 5,821 rooms (or 14 hotels) that were acquired by Blackstone after it bought out $300 million in debt on the 14 properties at a steep discount. Although Columbia Sussex made every payment required by the terms of the loan, Blackstone seized the portfolio via a \\"deed in lieu of foreclosure\\" in December 2010 after the loan securing the portfolio had hit maturity and Columbia Sussex was unable to re-finance due to the credit crisis. Blackstone had previously sold the same hotels to Columbia Sussex for $1.4 billion in 2006. Motels Columbia Sussex began operation as Columbia Development in 1972 with the construction of a single Days Inn location in Richwood, KY. Rapid expansion followed and by 1978 the company was renamed Columbia Sussex and was the largest Days Inn franchisee with 14 locations many with restaurants named after the founder's wife, Marty. Hotels In 1977 Columbia Sussex purchased their first full- service hotel, The President Motor Inn in Fort Wright, KY. The hotel was closed for renovations and re-opened as a Ramada Inn. Columbia Sussex then began a campaign of acquiring Holiday Inns and renovating them into properties featuring the Holidome concept. Together with the new loyalty program, Priority Club, which was a trailblazing concept at the time, market success followed. Holiday Inns were acquired in Dayton, OH, Springfield, OH, and a group of 4 Holiday Inns in Charleston, WV. In 1980 Columbia Sussex completed their largest acquisition to date with the purchase of the 400 room Holiday Inn in Southfield, MI. In the early 1980s Columbia Sussex continued to grow mainly through acquisition while focusing primarily on the Holiday Inn brand. In 1983 a 400-room Holiday Inn was purchased and renovated in Louisville, Kentucky. In 1984 Columbia Sussex began expanding through construction of new hotels. Major projects included a Holiday Inn Rochester, NY which served as the company's flagship for a few years. Also constructed in 1984 was a 400-room motel in Kissimmee, FL which carried the Best Western Flag. This was the last exterior corridor property ever constructed by the company. Columbia Sussex also opened the newly constructed Hilton Louisville East and purchased the Plymouth, MI Hilton. In 1985 Columbia Sussex purchased 3 Holiday Inns in the Chicago Area in Glen Ellyn, Itasca and Hillside. 1985 marked the end of the Holiday Inn focus for the company and the beginning of the Radisson Era. Columbia Sussex became the first franchisee of Radisson hotels with the purchase, renovation and re-branding of the Americana Hotel at the Cincinnati Airport located in Northern, KY. At the time of its opening the Radisson CVG was the 14th hotel with the Radisson brand in the US. Development of many new construction hotels followed in the late 1980s and early 90s of mostly Radisson branded hotels. In 1994 Radisson hotels in 5 cities were converted to Marriott. These were the first of many as Columbia Sussex transitioned from the largest Radisson franchisee to the largest full service Marriott Franchisee. In 2005 Columbia Sussex substantially upgraded their portfolio by acquiring 14 properties from Wyndham Corp for $1.4B while Blackstone simultaneously acquired the remainder of the Wyndham Corp. Shortly thereafter, Blackstone sold the Wyndham brand name to Cendant. Columbia Sussex repositioned these properties into 3 Hiltons, 2 Marriotts, 2 Sheratons and 6 Westins after significant remodeling. In 2006 Columbia Sussex purchased 2 Hiltons in Arlington, VA and Sacramento, CA from Blackstone in a $150m deal. 2007 marked Columbia Sussex's acquisition of the Sanibel Harbour Resort and Spa from Liberty Mutual Insurance for $126m. The property was re-branded as a Marriott in 2009. In 2013 Columbia Sussex bought an historic building in downtown Cincinnati called the Bartlett Building. A former bank, the building was extensively renovated and converted into a hotel branded the Renaissance Cincinnati Downtown. The hotel opened in summer of 2014. Casinos Columbia Sussex entered the gaming industry in 1990, purchasing the High Sierra hotel in Stateline, Nevada from Del Webb Corporation for $19 million. The property was renamed as the Horizon Casino Resort. The Lighthouse Point Casino in Greenville, Mississippi was opened in November 1996. Columbia owned the riverboat casino and a 79% stake in its operating company. In March 2002, JMBS Casino, a Columbia Sussex affiliate controlled by William Yung's children, bought Bayou Caddy's Jubilee Casino, a riverboat in Greenville, for $42 million. In 2002, Columbia bought the closed Maxim Hotel and Casino near the Las Vegas Strip for $38 million. After a $90 million renovation, the property was reopened in 2003 as the Westin Casuarina, using the name of Columbia's resort in the Cayman Islands. In 2004, Columbia bought the River Palms in Laughlin, Nevada and the Harrah's Vicksburg casino in Vicksburg, Mississippi, which it renamed to the Horizon Vicksburg. In October 2004, Columbia agreed to buy the President Casino St. Louis from bankrupt President Casinos for $57 million. The company planned a $150 million residential and retail development around the casino, even though some of the land was already earmarked for Pinnacle Entertainment's Lumi√®re Place project. The sale collapsed a year later, however, when Columbia withdrew its application for a gaming license. According to a lawsuit filed by President, the Missouri Gaming Commission was set to reject the application for \\"flimsy\\" reasons, including an IRS audit of Yung's 2000 income tax return and his use of a corporate credit card for personal expenses. President eventually won a judgment of $28 million plus $14 million in interest, for breach of contract and for unreasonable fee increases at the casino parking lot, which Columbia had already purchased. In 2005, Columbia bought the Bally's New Orleans casino from Caesars Entertainment for $24 million. Caesars needed to sell the casino to avoid antitrust concerns in its acquisition by Harrah's Entertainment, owner and operator of Harrah's New Orleans. It was later renamed as the Amelia Belle. The same year, Columbia bought Caesars Tahoe in Stateline from Caesars Entertainment for $45 million, and renamed it as the MontBleu. Columbia bought the Argosy Casino riverboat in Baton Rouge, Louisiana from Penn National Gaming in October 2005 for $150 million and renamed it as the Belle of Baton Rouge. The sale assuaged FTC antitrust concerns about Penn's acquisition of Argosy Gaming, which would have resulted in the company owning the only two casinos in the city. The company made a second attempt to enter the St. Louis market in May 2006, agreeing to pay $200 million for the Casino Queen riverboat in East St. Louis, Illinois, across the river from the President Casino. However, after ordering Casino Queen the following January to remove a minority shareholder with ties to an organized crime associate, the Illinois Gaming Board did not approve the sale by the February deadline set in the contract, and Columbia ended the deal in March. In December 2006, Columbia opened a 317-room $150 million Westin resort with a casino on the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. Aztar acquisition and Tropicana related bankruptcy In January 2007, Columbia acquired Aztar for $2.1 billion, after winning a bidding war against Ameristar Casinos and Pinnacle Entertainment. Aztar owned five casinos: the Tropicana Las Vegas, Tropicana Casino & Resort Atlantic City, Ramada Express in Laughlin, Casino Aztar in Evansville, Indiana and Casino Aztar in Caruthersville, Missouri. A new subsidiary, Tropicana Entertainment LLC, was created to hold Columbia's and Aztar's casinos. Columbia Sussex did not want to make another try for a Missouri gaming license, so Aztar agreed before the acquisition to sell the Caruthersville casino to Fortunes Entertainment, the company of Argosy Gaming co-founder Lance Callis. The deal fell through because the licensing process for Fortunes could not be completed on schedule, so to avoid closing the casino, Aztar allowed the Gaming Commission to appoint a supervisor to operate it, effective when the merger closed. Casino Aztar was finally sold in June 2007 for $45 million to Isle of Capri, which renamed it as Lady Luck Casino. At the time of the Aztar acquisition, the Tropicana Atlantic City was placed in a trust pending Yung's licensing by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. Yung's license was denied in December 2007 due in part to complaints about the Tropicana's maintenance and sanitation after Yung laid off 1,300 staffers. The commission declared that the company displayed a \\"lack of business ability, a lack of financial responsibility, and a lack of good character, honesty and integrity,\\" and a \\"defiance of the regulatory process.\\" Former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gary Stein was appointed as trustee and conservator of the property, with a mandate to find a new buyer. The loss of the Atlantic City property led Tropicana to default on its bank debt. Yung tried to sell the Vicksburg and Evansville casinos to raise cash to appease creditors, but it was not enough to prevent a lawsuit by bondholders. The Delaware Court of Chancery ruled in February 2008 that the transfer of the property to Stein constituted a technical default on the bonds. Stein asked to transfer the title back to Tropicana to cure the default, but the Commission roundly rejected the request. With no other options remaining, Tropicana Entertainment filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May. Debtholders viewed Yung's presence as a \\"distraction\\" and asked a court to appoint a trustee to run the company. Yung settled the dispute by agreeing in July to step down, leaving the other four board members in place. In May 2009, Tropicana, seeking to focus its Tahoe-area efforts on the MontBleu, transferred the Horizon Casino to a Columbia Sussex affiliate. Table games at the casino were eliminated, with a possible downsizing of slots also planned. The Tropicana Las Vegas, which had a $440 million secured loan against it, emerged from bankruptcy in July 2009 as a separate company led by Canadian private equity firm Onex and former MGM Mirage president Alex Yemenidjian. The remainder of the company emerged on March 8, 2010 as Tropicana Entertainment, led by Carl Icahn. The Amelia Belle, which was not included in the bankruptcy, was sold in October 2009 to Peninsula Gaming, owner of the Evangeline Downs racetrack, for $107 million. The Westin Casuarina Las Vegas, which also was not included in the bankruptcy, defaulted on its mortgage in April 2010, and lenders, led by CW Financial Services, filed for foreclosure the following November. The hotel's general manager said in October 2011 that Columbia Sussex would not fight the foreclosure.

It was a forerunner of Metro-Goldwyn- Mayer. The company produced its films in New York, Los Angeles, and sometimes at leased facilities in Fort Lee, New Jersey. It was purchased in 1919.  History  Advertisement for The Right of Way (1915) with William Faversham Metro Pictures was founded as a film distribution company in February 1915 by a number of \\"exchange men\\" with Richard A. Rowland as president, George Grombacker as vice-president and Louis B. Mayer as secretary. Grombacker owned exchanges in Portland and Seattle. Rowland and Metro's 2nd vice president James B. Clark were from the Roland & Clark company based in Pittsburgh. Metro was capitalized with $300,000 in cash and founded for the purpose of controlling movie productions for the exchanges. Rowland had been an investor in Alco Films which was a distribution company for a coalition of production companies. Mayer convinced Rowland to set up Metro to replace Alco to avoid being picked up by Paramount, Mutual Film, or Universal. Metro had Rolfe Photoplays, Inc. and Popular Plays and Players moving over from Alco to Metro. Additional production companies working with Metro were Columbia (1915‚Äì1917 [not the current Columbia], subsequently CBC Sales until 1918), Quality Picture Corporation, and Dyreda. In 1919, Metro established its Hollywood studio at Lillian Way and Eleanor St. while building its huge studio covering 4 city blocks at Roamin St. and Cahuenga Blvd, which opened in 1920. Its back lot was established in 1920 in Hollywood on N. Cahuenga Boulevard between Willoughby Avenue and Waring Avenue bound by Lillian Way on the east (today home to Red Studios Hollywood.) Metro's first release on March 29, 1915 was Satan Sanderson, a film produced by Rolfe Photoplays which was originally to be distributed by Alco Film Company. Sealed Valley was Metro's first production released on August 2, 1915. Mayer left to form his own production unit in 1918. In 1920, the company was purchased by Marcus Loew as a supplier of product for his theater chain. However, Loew was not satisfied with the amount or quality of Metro's output. A few years later in 1924, Loew merged it with the struggling Goldwyn Pictures and shortly Louis B. Mayer Productions then renamed the new entity Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer that year with Mayer in charge (who was never an owner, and was only ever an employee).  Stars  Metro's biggest stars during the World War I period were the romantic teams of Francis X. Bushman and Beverly Bayne and Harold Lockwood and May Allison. Also in top echelons of importance were actresses Mae Murray and Viola Dana and from the stage Lionel and Ethel Barrymore, Emmy Wehlen and Emily Stevens. Before merging into MGM in 1924, Metro's star roster had expanded to include Lillian Gish, Buster Keaton, Jackie Coogan, Marion Davies, Ramon Novarro, Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone.  Motion Picture Studios  Although the Metro film library and stars were merged into MGM in 1924, a portion of Rowland's Los Angeles film studio continued with a life of its own. Originally spanning four city blocks, one block continued as a studio known simply as Motion Picture Studios through the 1940s, and as General Service Studios and Desilu Studios through the 1950s and 1960s. It became Ren-Mar Studios in 1974. In January 2010, Ren-Mar Studios was bought by Red Digital Cinema Camera Company. The complex was renamed \\"Red Studios Hollywood\\". It is located on Cahuenga Blvd. north of Melrose Avenue in Hollywood, directly behind the Musicians AFM Local 47 on Vine Street. David E. Kelley filmed several of his TV series there, including Picket Fences, Ally McBeal, and The Practice.  Filmography  A 1965 fire in an MGM Archive #7 storage facility destroyed original negatives and prints, including the best-quality copies of every Metro picture and Louis B. Mayer Picture produced prior to 1924; over half of MGM's feature films from before 1930 are completely lost. On March 25, 1986, Ted Turner and his Turner Broadcasting System purchased pre-May 1986 MGM films (including Metro Pictures films) from Kirk Kerkorian for $600 million. ;Filmed in Fort Lee, NJ: * The Eternal Question (1916) Olga Petrova * The Divorce√© (1919) Ethel Barrymore * What People Will Say?

Located in the Bitterroot Range near the Idaho border along the route of the Mullan Road, it was a thriving railroad town c. 1908, named after William H. Taft (shortly before he was elected president in 1908). It is said in both ‚ÄúUp the Swiftwater‚Äù by Sandra A. Crowell and David O. Asleson, and in ‚ÄúThe Big Burn‚Äù by Timothy Egan, that the unnamed work camp got its name after Taft, then Secretary of War, traveling on a Northern Pacific train, berated the town as a blight on the American landscape which must clean up its act, to a cheering drunken crowd. The town was then enthusiastically named in his honor. The boomtown was founded when the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (\\"The Milwaukee Road\\") built its Pacific Coast extension (1906‚Äì09) and had to bore a tunnel through the mountains near its site.Description of Taft in 1939 from MTlinks.com Tunnel #20 on the railroad, it is known as St. Paul Pass Tunnel or Taft Tunnel; its East Portal is southwest at approximately above sea level and heads southwest into Idaho. In its earliest years, the town consisted mostly of men working for the railroad, mining, or forest industries. It was notorious for drinking, gambling, a murder rate higher than Chicago, and a reputed \\"five prostitutes for every man.\\" One reporter described it as \\"the wickedest city in America.\\" Taft burned to the ground on 21 August 1910, during \\"The Big Burn\\" - a giant forest wildfire fed by Palouser winds, and was not rebuilt. (see \\"The Big Burn\\" by Timothy Egan. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing, 2009.) Today, on Interstate 90, the site is noted by exit 5, marked \\"Taft.\\" The area hosts a maintenance yard for the Montana Department of Transportation, access to the Route of the Hiawatha rail trail, and access to St. Regis (Sohon) / Mullan Pass v√≠a Randolph Creek Road, which heads north and west from I-90.

Although TMP finds limited use per se, its derivatives are a mainstay of hindered amine light stabilizers. TMP is the starting material for an even stronger base lithium tetramethylpiperidide and the radical species TEMPO. Another non-nucleophilic base is N,N-diisopropylethylamine.

The intermediate triacetone amine is then reduced in a Wolff-Kishner reaction. 550px See also *2,6-Dimethylpiperidine *Pempidine *TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) ReferencesExternal links * DataSheet I * DataSheet II * TMP applied in synthesis in Organic Syntheses Category:Piperidines Category:Reagents for organic chemistry Category:Non- nucleophilic bases ","title":"2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine"},{"id":"1878915","text":"SIKU is the range of toy vehicles and related products produced by the German company Sieper L√ºdenscheid GmbH & Co. KG in L√ºdenscheid, Germany. The company manufactures many vehicles, but the Super Series 1:55 scale die-cast line is the core product, thus Siku historically could be seen as the \\"German Matchbox\\". The company also owns the well known HO scale producer Wiking- Modellbau. History Sieper-Werke (The Sieper company) was founded in 1921 (Wagner 2002‚Äì2007). It was originally a manufacturer of metal tools and cutlery in zamac and aluminum and, later on, ashtrays, badges, medals, belt buckles, and buttons (Wagner 2002‚Äì2007). The factory in Ludenscheid was outfitted with new casting molds in 1949 for grating, sandblasting and painting zinc cast goods. The company was even contracted to make Mercedes- Benz's star-shaped hood ornament (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002). The company also experimented with early plastics. In 1943 the company expanded to a facility in Hilchenbach, about from L√ºdenscheid, though the latter has always been Sieper-Werke's headquarters. Still, consumer products like plastics, furniture, mirrors and cabinets have been developed and manufactured in Hilchenbach. L√ºdenscheid, in turn, generally focused on promotional items for major brands, such as the 'elephant shoe' and 'Zeller black cat' which were produced by injection molding. It was not until 1950 that the company started producing toys in L√ºdenscheid, registering the trademark SIKU for the new products. SIKU originates from abbreviating the name of the founder of the company, Richard Sieper, and the German word for plastic, Kunststoffe (e.g. Sieper Plastics). Originally, there was a broad variety of SIKU toys which at first were plastic, including figures and animals. These were often called 'margarine figures' because they came in margarine packages as a food promotion (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002). The success of the plastic figures gave capital to start a post-war vehicle line. Between 1951 and 1955, the first vehicles were generic representations of a fire truck, a race car, an amphibious truck, a moving van, and finally, in 1955, a Porsche 356 (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002; Wagner, 2002‚Äì2007). The scale chosen was approximately 1:60. By 1958, SIKU had dropped figures to focus exclusively on the plastic vehicles, except where animals attended tractors and such. Model ranges=V-Series plastic In 1955, the first dedicated line of vehicles, the V-Series ('V' for 'Verkehrs'modelle or Traffic Models), was produced. These were replicas of actual vehicles in a uniform 1/60th scale. Colors were often dull and rather pastel. Vehicles were well-proportioned and detailed, like the Magirus fire truck with a whole series of ladders, a very detailed electric street car, or some figures like the drivers in the Mercedes 190, Porsche 550 Spyder, or Karmann Ghia convertibles (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002; Natrop No date A). One particularly sharply detailed model was V228 all plastic Willys Jeep with trailer which featured a detailed driver and folding windshield. Most vehicles did not have interiors, with the exception of convertibles or the double decker bus. Some of the Mercedes-Benzes even had hood ornaments! (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002). Several American cars were also offered in plastic. A 1956 Buick Century, a 1957 Mercury Voyager station wagon and a 1960 Chrysler New Yorker were among the creative selections (Natrop No date A). V Series metal Then in 1963, 12 new models produced in zinc alloy were introduced, and these were spray painted by hand (Wagner 2003‚Äì2009). Between 1963 and 1969, new releases were made in both plastic and metal, but there was a gradual shift to metal with fewer plastic models. The last plastic model was issued in 1969, and since that time all new models have been die-cast zamac. Most V-series vehicles came packaged in cardboard boxes with vehicles illustrated on opposite panels. Different colors were also shown on the opposite panels; some boxes being blue, red, some green and yellow. The style was somewhat reminiscent of early Solido boxes. This packaging was used until rather late, and seemed rather rustic compared to other companies' use of modern clear display blister cards which had become dominant by this time. Even most Matchbox Toys were now abandoning their Matchboxes. On the boxes, in German, was written \\"Siku-Flitzer\\" (or, \\"Siku- Streaker\\"). For some time on the boxes, illustrations of the vehicles were bathed in a yellow light from the round sun-like Siku logo. Other V-series boxes had orange and cream or green and yellow panels. In 1973, the letter V was removed from the numbering system. Similar to Corgi or Dinky, Sikus also used rhinestones for headlights which were sparkly and attractive but not very realistic (Ragan 2000, p. 36‚Äì37). One notable example was a Ford F-500 flat bed truck made in the mid-1960s. Proportions were realistic and colors were authentic looking. The grille was also authentically detailed with jeweled headlights. Wheels were done in a utilitarian black, detailed, but with no chrome. Rear wheels were 'duallies'. One model offered a dark green body, brown interior, and a red metal chassis. It was a heavy model of a heavy duty real truck (Ragan 2000, p. 36). The V Series came to an end in 1975, when the Super Series was introduced. Super Series The Super Series replaced the V series becoming the principal model range. Some V models were transferred to the Super Series and renumbered, but there were two differences between the new series and the old. First, the models were no longer spray painted by hand. Second, the new models were made in a slightly bigger scale of 1:55. Models were now numbered in a four digit system ‚Äì the first two designating the price range. Small cars traditionally had numbers that start in 10 or 13, but later on 08 and 14 were added. Larger vehicles including helicopters have various price range designations from 16 up. The second two digits are the model numbers within each price range. This uniform numbering system has since been applied to all new product ranges as well as to gift sets. Small cars were at first packaged in both picture boxes and blister packs. Boxes were dropped entirely by the mid-1980s. Large models were mostly packed in window boxes, with a few exceptions. One unfortunate design element in this time period was the unrealistic and rather gaudy white-walled tires labeled with 'Siku' on opposite sides of each tire and with and white 'spoked' wheels that appeared on most vehicles in this series. Fortunately, by the late 1990s, realistic wheel designs were adopted, like accurate mini mags for the Mini Cooper seen on this page. This series is still produced today, and since the incorporation of the Club Series (see below) in the early 1990s, large trucks as well as military tanks and a few aircraft have been made in the small car size and put in blister packages. Of course, their scale varied greatly too. Hence, a unified scale of 1:55 (or 1:60 for cars from the V series) is not uniformly applied. Siku keeps up with odd German sports cars selections like the Gumpert Apollo or the Wiesmann GT. Occasionally Siku outdoes itself with a very odd model. Sixteen inch tall cranes have been produced, helicopters on flat bed semi trucks, forestry log loaders, piston bully snow tracked vehicles, an ultra-detailed stake bed Mercedes Unimog, potato digger truck, triple engined competition pulling tractor and modern tram and subway cars. Perhaps the most outrageous is the AIDA Aluna 10-story plus cruise ship in 1:1,400 scale (18 cm long). Siku aeroplanes Siku first built 20 plane models in scale 1:250 in 1959. Despite good sales the company was forced to stop producing this range in 1964 due to the lack of a sufficient work-force. In the early 1990s, aeroplane models of this size reappeared. They were boxed and were in the price range 19.de (Wagner 2002‚Äì2009). Club Series Club Series was introduced in 1990 and consisted of die-cast trucks and farm vehicles made in smaller scale (usually 1:87). These were similar to the Super Series in that the blister packages were the same size and shape as those of small cars. The only difference was that the packaging had a different design and read \\"Siku Club.\\" However, after the first few years of production, the Club line was fully incorporated into the Super Series and adopted the Super packaging design. A few 1:55 models from the Super Series in the 08 price range were also packaged in the \\"Siku Club\\" package for a short period of time in 1992, when production switched from Germany to China (The Club Series vehicles have always been produced in China since their beginning in 1990). Farmer Series and Siku Control In 1983, the Farmer Series was introduced, mainly in 1:32 scale (Wagner 2002‚Äì2009). There is a Land Rover in the series (used as a farm vehicle ‚Äî in the U.K, and other Commonwealth countries, such Land Rovers were in widespread use on farms.) The Farmer Classic line was added in 2002, and focused on old-timer tractors. Subsequently, more detailed and refined farm vehicles have been introduced in these two series. For example, Classic models featured tractors with rustic looking 'aged' paint (Wagner 2002‚Äì2007). Post 2005, some of these realistic plastic vehicles, like a MAN refuse truck, were twelve inches long or more and, typical for the era, made in China, not Germany. In 2004, a radio- controlled tractor was introduced in the all new radio controlled 'SIKU Control' line, which added play value in addition to the regular SIKU Farmer Series vehicles. These have working acceleration, steering, headlights and turn indicators. Other models have since been added to the Control line. Super Classic This range of classic old-timer fire engines in 1:50 scale was added in 2005 to complement the contemporary models in the Super Series. This was done following the success of the Farmer Classic line. HO emphasis Through the 1980s, HO (1:87) scale manufacturers like Herpa, Busch, Trident, and Roco became ever more important in the European hobby market. In 1984, Sieper Werke moved to strengthen itself in this market with the purchase of Wiking-Modelbau, based in West Berlin and famous for HO scale plastic models. With scale of the models becoming variable in the Super Series, Siku also released the M87 series in 2003. All of the models are faithfully reproduced in 1:87, though this line is independent of the Wiking line. The range of models is limited but consists of semi-trailers, cranes, farm tractors, and cars. The trucks, cranes, and farm tractors are very similar to those made in smaller size in the Super Series (i.e., those that have their roots in the Club Series). The difference is that the M87 series vehicles are more detailed and are packaged in small window boxes versus blister card. SIKU Junior This Siku Junior line was launched in 1998. It consists of larger, detailed plastic trucks, construction vehicles, tractors and other agricultural vehicles and trailers. Siku Juniors are designed somewhat along the lines of German Bruder. Though the line is aimed primarily at outdoor play, these models are handsome and realistic and durability is a main feature. SIKU World This lineup was launched in 2013. It consists of plastic building and street tiles to complement SIKU vehicles. International markets With its respected V series, Siku battled with French Majorette and Dutch Efsi for the European market, but became the diecast kings in the Matchbox size in Germany. Starting in the early 1970s, Siku started breaking into international markets with increasing success, and the company abandoned most other diecast products, focusing more now on vehicles (Natrop 1998‚Äì2002). While Sikus became well-known across Europe, the brand never became widely popular in the United States, only sometimes being found at specialty hobby shops. Appearances at large department stores like WalMart, Hills, or Target were rare. The American scarcity was despite offering American cars like the Buick Wildcat, Oldsmobile Toronado, Pontiac Bonneville convertible, Cadillac limousine, Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Corvette, Lincoln Mark III, and Ford Mustang and Ford Trucks (Ragan 2000, 36; Natrop No date B). As of 2010 SIKU does not export toys to the United States due to conflicts with the CPSIA (The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act) of 2008. Collection and vintage value The V-Series and the Super Series have recently been highly sought among collectors. The manufacturing quality of the models is significantly higher than average, however, the price of individual models is higher as well. Today, new models still retain their quality similar to older Matchbox, Dinky and Corgi of decades past. For example, Siku wheels are more sculpted and detailed. Tires are separated from wheels and made of rubber, while other manufacturers make theirs in single cast plastic pieces.

Between 1914 and 1918 they produced 25,000 of their 9-cylinder Delta and Le Rh√¥ne 110 hp (81 kW) rotary designs, while another 75,000 were produced by various licensees. These engines powered the majority of aircraft in the first half of the war, both Allied designs as well as German examples produced by Motorenfabrik Oberursel. In the post-war era they started a new design series originally based on the Bristol Jupiter, but evolving into the excellent twin- row, 1,000 hp-class (750 kW) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K Mistral Major radial, which was likewise licensed and used around the world during World War II. They were a major supplier of engines to the German Luftwaffe, producing both their own designs as well as German ones under licence. Their factories were the target of highly accurate bombing, knocking them out of the war. The company was nationalized as a part of Snecma in 1949, but the brand lived on for a time as the manufacturer of Gnome et Rh√¥ne motorcycles and Gnome et Rh√¥ne bicycles. Early history and World War I=Gnome In 1895 the 26-year-old French engineer Louis Seguin bought a license for the Gnom \\\\- Rolls-Royce website gas engine from the German firm Motorenfabrik Oberursel. Sold under the French translation, the Gnome was a single-cylinder stationary engine of about 4 hp (3 kW) that ran on kerosene (known in the UK and South Africa as paraffin) intended to be used in industrial applications. The Gnome used a unique valve system with only one rod-operated exhaust valve, and a \\"hidden\\" intake valve located on the cylinder head. Gnome 9N Monosoupape of 1917 On 6 June 1905 Louis Seguin and his brother Laurent formed the Soci√©t√© Des Moteurs Gnome (the Gnome Motor Company) to produce automobile engines. They soon started development of one of the first purpose-designed aircraft engines, combining several Gnome cylinders into a rotary engine. The design emerged in the spring of 1909 as the 7-cylinder rotary Gnome Omega, delivering 50 hp (37 kW) from 75 kg. More than 1,700 of these engines would be built in France, along with license-built models in Germany, Sweden, Britain, the United States and Russia. The Gnome powered Henry Farman's Farman III aircraft to take the world records for distance and endurance, as well as powering the first aircraft to break 100 km/h, as well as the first seaplane ever to fly in 1910, powering France to become the leading country in aviation at the time. L√©on Lemartin and Jules V√©drines were two young engineers who participated in the design, development and implementation of the Omega, and in the milieu of the pioneering days of flight they both went on to become successful pilots. All of the Gnomes were known for their unique solutions to getting fuel to the top of the piston without using piping. Early models used two valves, one in the cylinder head and a second embedded in the piston itself, counterweighted to open at the end of the stroke. Without any springs or pushrods, the valve would pop open on the downstroke, allowing fuel to be drawn into the cylinder from the crankcase area. Unfortunately it was also very difficult to service, requiring the cylinder to be disassembled. In order to improve reliability and maintenance, later models used the Monosoupape (single-valve) system instead, using a single exhaust valve at the top of the cylinder and using a series of ports to allow the fuel mixture into the top of the cylinder when the piston had moved down in the cylinder past the ports. The basic Gnome design was then delivered in a series of larger engines. The Gnome Lambda of 1911 was a larger 80 hp (60 kW) version of the Omega, followed by the 9-cylinder 100 hp (75 kW) Gnome Delta in 1914 (also called the Gnome Monosoupape as it used that type of engine design for the first time). Gnome also tried a 14-cylinder two-row version, the Double Lambda of 160 hp (120 kW), but this saw little use, even though it was copied by Oberursel as the U.III in Germany, and used in a few early Fokker fighter designs without success. To deliver more power with the advent of high-power inline engines late in the war, a completely new nine- cylinder Monosoupape design was delivered in 1918 as the Type-N, delivering 160 hp. This design saw use on the little-known but excellent Nieuport 28. Le Rh√¥ne 80 hp Le Rh√¥ne 9C rotary engine Another French engineer, Louis Verdet, designed his own small rotary engine in 1910 which did not see much use. In 1912 he delivered a larger 7-cylinder design, the 7C, which developed 70 hp from 90 kg. This proved much more popular and he formed Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Le Rh√¥ne later that year. He soon followed the 7C with the larger Le Rh√¥ne 9C, a nine-cylinder design delivering 80 hp (60 kW). Compared to the Gnome's, the Le Rh√¥ne was considerably more \\"conventional\\", using copper intake manifold pipes to bring the fuel to the top of each engine cylinder, along with intake and exhaust valves. Like Gnome, the Le Rh√¥ne designs were widely licensed, in this case the 110 hp Le Rhone 9J was produced in Germany by Oberursel as their Ur.II model as designated by IdFlieg, and in the United States; the Union Switch & Signal Company of Swissvale, PA was reported to have produced some 10,000 units - it was also built in Austria, Britain and Sweden. Gnome et Rh√¥ne Bond of the Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Gnome et Rh√¥ne, issued 1. July 1924 After several years of fierce competition, Gnome and Le Rh√¥ne finally decided to merge. Negotiations started in 1914, and on 12 January 1915 Gnome bought out Le Rh√¥ne to form Soci√©t√© des Moteurs Gnome et Rh√¥ne. Developments of the 9C continued to be their primary product, improving in power to about 110 hp (80 kW) in the Le Rh√¥ne 9J by the end of the war. The 9-series was the primary engine for most early-war designs both in French and British service as well as in Germany where, perhaps somewhat ironically, Oberursel had taken out a license just before the war. Oberursel's engine based on the Gnome designs were prefixed with a U, while those based on the Le Rh√¥ne a Ur. The Inter-War years With the end of the war the company rapidly diversified, using their factories to produce chassis and engines for the Rolland-Pilain and Piccard-Pictet cars, along with Ansaldo diesel engines, refrigerators, sewing machines and even jackhammers. In 1920 they also introduced their first motorcycle, simply known as the Gnome et Rh√¥ne 500 cc. Various models were produced up to the early 1950s, typically advertised as simply \\"Gnome Rhone\\" with no accents. By 1920 their rotary engines were no longer competitive, and they had no new designs of their own. In 1921 they took out a license for the Bristol Jupiter, which was in the process of becoming the Gnome of its era. In 1922, Paul-Louis Weiller, a World War I ace, took over the company and decided to focus it on aircraft engines once again. Their Jupiter designs, the 9A, were soon selling very well. In 1926 they took out a license for the smaller 5-cylinder Bristol Titan, while Bristol licensed the Farman-style reduction gearing used by Gnome. Not satisfied to simply produce Bristol designs under license, Gnome started a major design effort based around the mechanicals of the Titan. The results were introduced in 1927 as the K-series, spanning the 260 hp (190 kW) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5K Titan, the 7-cylinder 370 hp (270 kW) version, the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 7K Titan Major, and the 9-cylinder 550 hp (405 kW) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9K Mistral. All of these engines were delivered in a variety of improved versions, named with a three letter code; the first letter was the series number (a through f for instance), the second a r or l depending on which direction the engine turned, and the third indicating the charging system. With the introduction of the K-series, Gnome ended royalty payments to Bristol. By 1930 they had delivered 6,000 Jupiters, Mistrals and Titans, making them the largest engine company in France. But the 550 hp (405 kW) Mistral was no longer powerful enough for the rapidly evolving industry. To provide more power Gnome once again turned to the two-row solution, using two banks of 7 cylinders, delivering the 625 hp (460 kW) Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14K Mistral Major in 1929. The new engine was an instant hit. By 1933 the 14Kfrs had improved the power to 1,025 hp (750 kW) through better supercharging (along with similar improvements in the Mistral, now at 770 hp or 570 kW), and the engine was once again being licensed around the world. Leaving the idea of having many engines in a single \\"K-series\\", Gnome continued work with the basic mechanical design to produce the 18-cylinder two-row Gnome-Rh√¥ne 18L of 1400 hp (1030 kW). Its power-to-weight ratio was not very good and work on the design was eventually stopped in 1939. A smaller engine, the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M Mars was introduced to replace the earlier K-series Mistral, notable primarily for its extremely compact frontal area, giving by far the most power for size of any engine of the era. It was especially used in the Potez 631 aircraft family. In 1936 the 14K-series was replaced by the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N delivering 1,100 hp (810 kW) from a slightly heavier engine that nevertheless had a much better power-to-weight ratio. Starting with the N they introduced a new naming scheme, replacing the earlier model letters with numbers, delivering the engine in versions that turned left with even numbers and right with odd. The original 14N-0/1 was run through a number of versions, the 14N-10/11 being used on the Bloch MB.210 bomber, the 14N-25 on early examples of the MB.152 fighter, and the 14N-49 on late MB.152s as well as LeO 451s and Amiot 351s. The N-series finally ended with the 14N-50/51, which delivered 1,210 hp (890 kW) for takeoff. The 14N was not as widely licensed, as the war was approaching and the French government was becoming increasingly wary of licensing designs to potential enemies. The 14N-series was itself replaced by the ultimate pre-war evolution of the line, the Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14R. The first versions introduced in 1939, the 14R-4/5, produced 1,291 hp (950 kW) for takeoff and was only slightly heavier than the 14N. By 1940 the improved 14R-8/9 was delivering 1,578 hp (1,161 kW) by increasing RPM from 2,400 to 2,600. Although this was a good figure for the era, British and German design had already passed this mark, and would soon be pressing on 2,000 hp (1,500 kW). With the fall of France in 1940, Gnome et Rh√¥ne was ordered to produce the BMW 801 under license, while the 14M and 14N saw limited use on some German designs, such as the Henschel Hs 129B, Gotha Go 244B, and Messerschmitt Me 323. The company became infamous for slow production, building only 8,500 engines by May 1944, when the Germans had been estimating 25,000. An air raid by 56 Lancasters and 8 Mosquitos of 5 Group of the RAF completely destroyed the original Gennevilliers factories on 9/10 May. Another air raid by Lancasters of 617 Squadron led by Wing Commander Leonard Cheshire had also severely damaged the Limoges factory on 8/9 February 1944. With the end of the war, the company was in no condition to continue in the aero-engine business, although they picked up small contracts to produce M4 Sherman tanks for the French army. In order to save what was left the company was nationalized on 29 May 1945, creating the Soci√©t√© Nationale d'Etude et de Construction de Moteurs d'Aviation (SNECMA), and producing the 14N, 14R and the new 14U. Licensed versions and developments The 14K was one of the most popular engines of its era, widely licensed and used around the world. In Poland it was used for export fighter variants, most notable PZL P.24. In particular it was used in Romania, where it powered a number of Polish designed PZL fighters before finally becoming the main engine of the IAR 80 fighter. In Yugoslavia the 7K, 9K and 14N-0 were built by Industrija motora Rakovica.http://www.imr-rakovica.com/englishbre/istorijat.html Isotta Fraschini and Piaggio of Italy both took out licenses, the former producing the K.14, the latter the P.XI. These were used on a number of designs in the pre-war period, many of which were exported. This led to Manfred Weiss taking out a license in Hungary, producing it as the WM K-14 in order to power their versions of the Reggiane Re.2000 fighter called the MAVAG Heja \\"Hawk\\", as well as the Weiss WM 21 S√≥lyom. The British firm Alvis had licensed the 14K and 18L, but neither entered production before the war ended. Nevertheless, Alvis pressed ahead with development, releasing the 9-cylinder Alvis 501 Leonides and later the 14-cylinder Alvis 701 Leonides Major. The latter saw some use on post-war helicopter designs. The Soviet Union, through its Tumansky OKB design bureau, license-built the 14K (as the M-85), building nearly 500 examples.Family tree of Tumansky piston engines Engines=World War IGnome= *Gnome Œ©50 Omega (a.k.a. 50 hp) *Gnome Œõ80 Lambda (a.k.a. 80 hp) *Gnome Œî100 Delta (a.k.a. 100 hp) *Gnome Œ£60 Sigma (a.k.a. 60 hp) *Gnome Œ©Œ©100 Omega Omega (a.k.a. 100 hp) *Gnome ŒõŒõ160 Lambda-Lambda (a.k.a. 160 hp) *Gnome ŒîŒî200 Delta Delta (a.k.a. 200 hp) *Gnome Monosoupape **Gnome Monosoupape 7 Type A:(1916) 80 hp (60 kW) **Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type B-2:(1916) 100 hp (75 kW) **Gnome Monosoupape 9 Type N:(1917) 150 or 160 hp (112 or 119 kW) =Le Rh√¥ne= *Le Rh√¥ne 9C *Le Rh√¥ne 9J - referred to widely as \\"the 110hp Le Rh√¥ne\\" Between wars *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5B Titan *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 5K Titan *Gnome- Rh√¥ne 7K Titan Major *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9A Jupiter *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9K Mistral *Gnome- Rh√¥ne 14K Mistral Major *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14L *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 18L World War II *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14M Mars *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14N *Gnome-Rh√¥ne 14R Motorcycles From 1920 Gnome et Rh√¥ne diversified into the bicycle and motorcycle business producing some relatively successful and stylish products. They first organized the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise des Moteurs ABC in Paris in 1920, to build the Granville Bradshaw designed ABC motorcycle in 1920, which they produced until 1924. Bradshaw's original 400cc design was enlarged by Gnome et Rhone to 493cc, and approximately 3000 models were produced through 1924. The company then embarked on its own motorcycle designs, producing single-cylinder and flat-twin machines through WW2. * 3CV Type Junior () * 4CV Major () * 4CV Super Major () * 5CV Type D.5 () * 5CV Type C.V.2 () * 5CV Type V.2 () * Type X () See also *Rotary Engine - Gnome NotesReferences *A History of Aircraft Piston Engines, Herschel Smith, Sunflower University Press, 1981 External links *Gnome :- includes an animation of the Gnome valve system *Gnome Omega :- interactive 3D model with free Viewpoint Media Player *Gnome Omega engine: operating manual by Andre Preynat 1917 (in French) *Gnome-Rhone 9C, 9J engines: operating manual 1915 (in French) Category:Former motorcycle manufacturers of France Category:Defunct aircraft engine manufacturers of France Category:Cycle manufacturers of France Category:Manufacturing companies based in Paris ","title":"Gnome et Rh√¥ne"},{"id":"1878922","text":"Northern Illinois University's Convocation Center is a 10,000-seat multi- purpose arena, at 1525 W Lincoln Hwy, in DeKalb, Illinois, USA.Venue Info - NIU - Convocation Center The arena opened in 2002.

Through a system of weirs, the bypass diverts floodwaters from the Sacramento River away from the state's capital city of Sacramento and other nearby riverside communities. During wet years, the bypass can be full of water. The main input to the bypass is through the passive Fremont Weir, where water spills from the Sacramento into the bypass if it reaches the crest. Downstream, the Sacramento Weir, just north of the city of West Sacramento, can also be opened to divert additional waters from the Sacramento if needed. From the west, Cache Creek drains into the bypass. The bypass itself runs south, parallel to the Sacramento, and drains into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a few kilometres north of Rio Vista. The bypass is crossed by the Yolo Causeway, a long highway bridge on Interstate 80, linking West Sacramento and the city of Davis. To the north, Interstate 5 also crosses the bypass on the Elkhorn Causeway, east of the city of Woodland. History Sacramento experienced several severe floods prior to construction of the bypass. The Yolo Basin, a depression formed during the last Ice Age, would fill up with water during the winter months from seasonal rainfall and runoff into the three rivers surrounding what is now the city of Sacramento (Sacramento, San Joaquin, and American). This created a diverse marsh ecosystem that could last more than 100 days. During the 1800s, seasonal flooding would limit travel and access between cities in the Sacramento River valley. Destructive floods in 1862 and 1878 prompted various flood control measures, including the long Tule Canal (completed in 1864) along the eastern edge of the present-day Yolo Bypass; and the Elkhorn Weir (1897‚Äì1917), downstream of the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers. Congress approved the Sacramento River Flood Control Project in 1911, with a plan to divert the water through multiple weirs and bypasses. The Yolo Bypass is one of two major bypasses in the Sacramento Valley that helps deter urban flooding. The other bypass is the Sutter Bypass, which lies upstream of the Yolo Bypass. The Yolo Bypass floodplain was designed in the early 1930s by the US Army Corps of Engineers. It lies just in between Yolo and Solano Counties. The California Department of Water Resources's schematic map of the Yolo Bypass, 2009. The Yolo Bypass extends approximately long, north to south, and wide. The western and eastern edges are defined by levees separated by a distance ranging from apart, except for an long segment immediately south of the mouth of Putah Creek. The two largest sources for the Yolo Bypass are the Sacramento Weir, completed in 1916, and the Fremont Weir, completed in 1929. Uses Almost 75% of the Yolo Bypass is privately owned, while the rest belongs to the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Most of the land is used for agriculture during the summer and spring, and the rest makes up marshland. This marshland is ideal for animal habitat, and is also utilized for fishing, hunting, and other recreational activities. Flood control Fremont Weir (2010) Flood control is the main purpose of the Yolo Bypass. When the flowrate of the Sacramento River exceeds approximately , the excess is released into the Yolo Bypass at the passive Fremont Weir, near that river's confluence with the Feather River. The Fremont Weir, which lies along the south bank of the Sacramento, is about tall, nearly shorter than the levee on the north bank. When the water reaches the mark it starts to flow out into the Yolo Basin. North of where the Elkhorn Causeway crosses the Yolo Bypass, the Cache Creek flood control basin drains into the Yolo Bypass. The Knights Landing Ridge Cut, where the Colusa Basin Drainage Canal empties, also contributes to the flow in the Yolo Bypass near this point. There is a second weir just north of West Sacramento, the Sacramento Weir, upstream of the confluence of the Sacramento and American Rivers. The Sacramento Weir is opened manually when the Sacramento River reaches at the I Street Bridge. It was built in 1916 by the City of Sacramento and contains 48 gates over its length; water from the Sacramento Weir flows through the long Sacramento Bypass and drains into the Yolo Bypass. The crest of the Sacramento Weir is at and the top of the moveable gates is ; each gate is long. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;font-size:90%;\\" + style=\\"font-size:125%;\\"  Yolo Bypass inlets - !

In the Liberty Farms area, the bypass joins first Prospect Slough and then Cache Slough adjacent to the connection of the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel. Cache Slough then reconnects with the Sacramento River just north of Rio Vista. The water eventually flows into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, just above Rio Vista, and from there into San Francisco Bay. The Yolo Bypass can hold approximately four times the flow of the Sacramento River. Together, the Sacramento River and Yolo Bypass are designed to handle a maximum flow of , of which the Sacramento handles and the bypass . This flood management relieves pressure on the surrounding river levee systems and reduces the risk of urban flooding in nearby cities, such as Sacramento or Davis. During wet years, which occur during more than half of all rainy seasons, the Yolo Bypass is flooded; when flooded, it covers an area equal to the area of San Francisco and San Pablo Bays, to a depth ranging from . Flooded Yolo Bypass, February 2006. Interstate 80 runs along the causeway in the distance. The state of California has the right to inundate any land in the Yolo Bypass with floodwater. These rights also limit landowners from growing vegetation or building structures that would significantly obstruct flow. There is no compensation for farmers who may lose crops or other losses due to flooding. The state manages the flooding of the Yolo Bypass with farmers and native species in mind. Using adaptive management, there is a balance between providing efficient flood protection, agriculture, and habitat benefits in the Yolo Bypass year-round. Wildlife habitats The Yolo Bypass contains the Fremont Weir Wildlife Area, Sacramento Weir Wildlife Area and Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. The Vic Fazio Yolo Wildlife Area is also part of the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area and was the largest public/private restoration project west of the Florida Everglades. The entire bypass forms a valuable wetland habitat when flooded during the winter and spring rainy season. In the summer, areas of the bypass outside the wildlife areas are used for agriculture. Approximately 250,000 Mexican free-tailed bats migrate to and nest under the Yolo Causeway during the summer (2018) The Yolo Bypass provides habitat for over 280 terrestrial vertebrate species, changing throughout the seasons. The natural flooding provides an exceptionally good nursery habitat for native fish species, including the endangered Chinook salmon. Juvenile salmon have been found to grow substantially better in the Yolo Bypass than the adjacent Sacramento River. Other special-status wildlife residing in the Yolo Bypass includes giant garter snake, fairy shrimp, bald eagle, Swainson's Hawk, and more. Wildlife managers occasionally flood certain areas to create wetlands for migratory waterfowl. The Yolo Bypass is somewhat of a pit stop for the waterfowl, and it provides nesting habitat and food for this abundance of birds. The Yolo Basin Wetlands Project is accounted as being one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the Western United States. Habitats in the Yolo Basin Wetlands includes seasonal wetlands, uplands, perennial wetlands, vernal pools and riparian forest. The Bypass also holds species of riparian vegetation such as cottonwoods, black walnut, willows, saltgrass, and other assorted tree and grass species. Habitat Management activities are monitored annually by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Wildlife Area Habitat Committee for area in the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area. Each year they establish a specific management plan for different parts of the land. The targeted species for seasonal wetland management is the timothy species. This plant provides countless nutritional seeds for consumption by assorted migratory waterfowl. There are also quite a few nonnative species that are not necessarily wanted in the bypass such as dock and perennial pepperweed.Biological Resources Retrieved June 28, 2018. The Yolo Bypass in March 2006, looking east from Davis toward Sacramento. Heavy rainstorms in January led to total flooding in the bypass. Years with high flows in the Yolo Bypass also benefit fish populations in the San Francisco Estuary. This is mainly because of increased habitat availability, food supply, larval transport, and reduced predation. Agriculture The floodplains of the Yolo Bypass are a surprisingly good farming ground for multiple seasonal crops. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife leases out land to farmers through the Dixon Resource Conservation District. The most widely grown crops include rice, safflower, processing tomatoes, corn, sunflower, and irrigated pasture. Half of the rice grown in the Yolo Bypass is wild due to its tolerance to colder weather. Farming is mainly done in late spring and summer when flooding does not usually occur, but farming can be halted or pushed back depending on the water level in the Bypass. Agricultural crops from Yolo County amount to about $300 million a year. Leftover crop residue is also beneficial to animal habitat. The already harvested land creates foraging area, and food opportunities, such as seeds for ring-necked pheasants and mourning dove. Recreation and education The Yolo Bypass provides a multitude of recreational uses and educational as well. The Yolo Bypass Wildlife Headquarters provides summer educational programs for children in kindergarten through high school. These programs include hands on activities on plants, animals, and wetlands, using the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area as a classroom. They have summer camps, classes, and are open to schools wanting to coordinate field trips as well. The Bypass is also open for guided tours for all ages of the public every month. Ducks take flight at Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area (2007) The Yolo Bypass is often used for bird watching, hunting, and hiking. Game species include waterfowl (when the bypass is flooded), ring- necked pheasant, and mourning dove. There are also assorted trails that loop around the wetlands in the Yolo Bypass that may be accessed by the public. Future Recent modeling shows that increasing flow to the Yolo Bypass may be beneficial for animal habitat. An upcoming project looks to extend the Yolo Bypass by potentially pushing back the levees, and allowing more room for water to be released into the Yolo Bypass. Separately, the Bay Delta Conservation Plan includes plans to help restore fish habitat in the Yolo Bypass. Its plan is to put a notch at the top the Fremont Weir to allow for more water to flow, increasing the frequency of flooding for fish habitat. The Nigiri Project The Nigiri ProjectThe Nigiri Project Retrieved June 28, 2018. is a collaborative research study being done in the Yolo Bypass at Knaggs Ranch by the UC Davis Center for Watershed Sciences, the California Department of Water Resources, and the nonprofit organization California Trout. This research is being conducted to find out how floodplains, particularly flooded rice fields, can provide habitat to endangered species such as the Chinook Salmon. In the summer these fields are used for the production of rice, while in the winter, the land can be flooded to create ideal wetland habitat for salmon. They have been experimenting for the past 4 consecutive winters, and have documented the fastest growth of Juvenile Chinook Salmon ever recorded in the Central Valley. The experiment aims to mimic the natural annual flood cycle of the Sacramento River, which most native fish species relied upon. This project is currently funded by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, California Trout, and the California Department of Water Resources.

The force was constituted in the early 1990s in response to the growing crime levels in the country after the fall of communism. RENEA's responsibilities are rescue operations, hostage situations, counter-terrorism and response to particularly violent forms of crime. Since 1990, the unit has lost four men in action and more than forty wounded. Their skills are highly regarded and well thought-of inside Albania and in the West, they are reported to have one of the highest OPTEMPOs (frequency of deployments) in all of Europe and they have been trained by GSG 9. http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?60161-Albanian-Armed- Forces/page2 Background Following the emergence of capitalism in Albania after 1990 and in order to eradicate all semblances to and associations with the communist state, many investigators, attorneys and police officers were simply dismissed. This confused situation soon allowed organized and individual crime to flourish to the point that it soon became the norm of everyday life. Kidnapping, extortion, drug-related crime, murder and human trafficking were at an all-time high, and the Albanian fledgling democracy did not have the legal, administrative and organizational experience to combat these problems -- in fact its infrastructure was almost non-existent. During communism, the force that was entrusted with CT and other special missions was Unit 326, but because of its role in suppressing public unrest during the popular uprising against communism, it had been neglected. The new public order authorities recognised the need for a small professional force, and after exhaustive trials and training finally established what subsequently came to be known as RENEA. It was also known as Unit 88. It was composed of eighty members, or operatives, who were elected from the 600 original members of Unit 326. The rest of the operators joined subsequent special intervention groups that came into existence. Composition of the unit The real number is secret but is estimated to be about 200 members. Initially, its organization was military in nature, dividing each team in groups of four, after the reputable British SAS system. In case of an open conflict, the police were expected to assume military duties. However, after the administrative reform of the Albanian Police, such duties were excluded from the police curriculum. Consequently, even RENEA was reorganized, this time modelling itself after sister units such as GSG-9,Misionet dhe humbjet e Forcave Speciale Shqiptare n√´ 24 vite GIS, NOCS, GIGN etc. The tactics are still primarily SAS-based, but not the actual duties. The unit is composed of negotiators, infiltrators, divers, rock-climbing, sappers, snipers and a small nucleus of logistics operatives. Structure Organization: *Support Command :#Directory of Operational Movable Forces (F.L.O), first level (center): :#Sector of planification and coordination of the operations :#Sector of training *Departments and Special Units, second level (base): :#The department of neutralization of armed elements (RENEA) :#The department of helicopters :#Anti-explosive unit :#Unit of negotiation *Composition :#Rapid reaction Unit Shkodra :#Rapid reaction Unit Tirana :#Rapid reaction Unit Fier Selection and training 250px The selection process is held only once a year and lasts twelve weeks. Subsequently, recruits are trained for an additional nine months in other skills such as linguistics, signals, photography, and hostage negotiations. Candidates also continue undergoing strict psychological and physical tests. Only after a period of three years may the recruit become a RENEA operator cleared in participating in hostage rescue operations. About 90 per cent of candidates come from other branches of the police and the National Guard, while the rest are military. The military candidates that pass selection must also complete a six-month course on jurisprudence. The maximum age for selection is 26 years and candidates are expected to have been members of their respective previous units for no less than two years. The first two weeks are called the \\"shake-down\\", in which almost everyone takes part. Only the negotiators and part of the logistics group (not including drivers) are exempted. Candidates undergo long and complicated psychological and durability tests designed to weed out weaker applicants. \\"Shake-down\\" is harsh, consisting of forced marches in full combat gear. True to their SAS origins, the operatives must carry a 35 kg (77 lb) backpack, AK-47 with eight full magazines, handgun and magazines, knives, gas mask, and radio. Their training routes take part in the worst weather, in some of the toughest terrain that Albania has to offer: in the northeastern mountain range (the highest peak is Korabi, at 2,751 metres (9,025 feet)), the marshes of Vlora, and the swamps of Durr√´s and Lezha. Approximately 75 per cent of the candidates fail at this initial phase. The last day is reserved for infiltration tests. The candidates that have successfully accomplished the first phase are left helpless in some remote part of Albania, at a safe distance from the capital, with 200 commandos and national guardsmen at their heels. Each is expected to make it back to headquarters in Tirana unintercepted. If they are caught they go home. Training, preparation and tests change according to the whims of the instructors, who are themselves veterans of the unit. They have a reputation for being unyielding and unmerciful. The role of the negotiator From 1991, the unit's negotiators have resolved, without resorting to violence, more than 500 of the 600 cases involving kidnappers and armed occupations.Sekretet e Reneas, nga armatimi tek st√´rvitja speciale All negotiators must have served for minimum of ten years with the police force and are persons of good temperament and mental balance, with knowledge of all dialects and regional mentalities. They all either have a degree in law or have attended the police academy. In addition they complete training courses with the FBI at Quantico FBI Academy and with other United States federal agencies. The negotiators are the first to intervene in cases of an occupation with or without hostages. Nobody intervenes without their explicit order, except in cases when the hostage is already dead. Weaponry and equipment RENEA's Operator Raldi Duka at ALMEX 2010 (Albanian Military Exhibition on Security and Defense) The force uses a motley collection of weapons. One of the primary tools is the Beretta ARX-160 A3, which Albania possesses in abundance. However, the unit is also known to have used the HK G3 7.62√ó51mm NATO. Submachine guns, such as the HK MP5 are also highly regarded. The fighting knives are of mixed origins - Randall and an assortment of locally manufactured products depending on the preferences of the operatives themselves. Knife fighting is a considered vital skill and the operatives are highly trained. RENEA's weaponry is currently being updated and brought in line with weapons that are conventionally used by sister units abroad. The sniper rifle is another tool of the trade for RENEA. Initially, the unit favoured the Russian Dragunov SVD, which, is still in use with the military and various law enforcement agencies. However, the SVD is actually intended to extend the effective range of fire of infantry squads up to 600 metres. Given the delicate nature of their missions, RENEA reverted to \\"proper\\" sniper rifles and currently employs SAKO TRG-22, TRG-42 and M10 rifles. Search and rescue training is effected with live ammunition. Operatives themselves simulate the hostage. Many special halls and rooms are built to conduct this type of training, and are known as \\"SAS Rooms\\" by the unit. In addition, \\"Good faith shooting\\" is practised, which consists of the operatives standing in line facing one another and shooting at targets placed between them. The bulletproof Kevlar vest and helmet are the same as those used by the German GSG-9. They are quite heavy, but they can stop a .30-06 projectile. All types of flash-bang, tear gas and non-lethal ammunition are in the unit's arsenal. British Avalon anti-gas masks, fireproof clothing (the same as used by the Italian GIS, and NOCS), kneepads, fireproof and tear-proof gloves are also used. Most of the personal equipment is of US origins, but a few Italian types are also in use, such as Vega and Radar. In special situations the use of (Russian 7.62√ó39mm RPD and RPK machine guns) is authorized. Beretta APX and Glock 34 are the favorite sidearms. H&K; USPs is also in use depending on the personnel preference. Vehicles in use include IVECO vans, Mitsubishi SUVs, and a motley collection of armoured and private cars. In waterborne operations, Zodiac boats confiscated from traffickers are in use. Depending on the circumstances, the Albanian Navy could place at their disposal various types of boats and other craft. Mil Mi-8 helicopter is used if a situation demands infiltration by air. Notable missions Golden Medal of the Eagle awarded to RENEA by the President of the Republic Albania *January 1991: In riots at the Shenkoll (Saint Nicholas) maximum security prison, an armed prisoner took several guards hostage. The attention of national and foreign media was drawn to the crisis. The government of the time sent in Unit 326, the predecessor of RENEA, which quelled the riots using tear gas and rubber bullets, without bloodshed. One operative was lightly wounded in the process. *November 1992: Albania was plagued by massive floods, which inundated many parts of the country. RENEA distributed food and provided shelter and medical assistance for the uprooted via speedboat and helicopter. One operative (killed in the line of duty in August 1993) selflessly dived into the icy waters and saved three drowning shepherds. *April 1996: In a diplomatic high-level meeting between the Italian president Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and Sali Berisha in Tirana, a deranged individual armed with a grenade with the safety pin removed sought to approach the two presidents. The two officials were immediately taken away from the scene, while a RENEA negotiator steadily approached the perpetrator and made contact by twisting his arm, taking the grenade from his hand and putting the safety pin back onto the weapon. *January 1997: A female student in depressive state roamed the streets of Tirana with a grenade in her hand. A RENEA operator approached her and defused the situation without bloodshed. *1997: During the crisis that threw Albania in a state of anarchy as a result of the collapse of various pyramid schemes, where three quarters of the population lost their savings, RENEA was entrusted with the task of safeguarding the monetary and gold reserves of the National Bank and other financial institutions. RENEA accomplished the task by removing all valuables from the facilities in unarmed IVECO vans. No money was lost in the process. This operation, at a time when many police officers were killed by angry civilians, is remembered by the unit as Operation Kamikaze. During the same year, 90 per cent of all police stations were looted and taken over by armed individuals. RENEA retook possession of these facilities, recalled all officers to work, and re-established communications and security systems. In many cases, the operatives repaired all damaged property themselves. *1998-1999: During these years RENEA was engaged in fights with multiple gangs across the nation, which, as a result of the previous year's anarchy, were armed with weaponry ranging from personal equipment to artillery and anti- aircraft batteries looted from military depots. *July 1998: The unit conducted a CT mission by arresting five Egyptian terrorists connected to Bin Laden's Al-Qaeda. *March 1999: Three armed criminals murdered three police officers and four civilians. Subsequently, they barricaded themselves into a house, taking hostage a couple and their 7-month-old daughter. A RENEA team went in, freed the hostages, and in the process killed the criminals. *May 1999: An Albanian emigrant in Greece, disgruntled over payment with his employer, after complained to the Greek authorities and was escorted to the border and deported to Albania. After buying an AK-47 and two grenades, he returned to Greece and went to Thessaloniki, where he took hostage a bus carrying fourteen people. The Greek government gave him the $250,000 that he had asked for and allowed him to enter Albania with his hostages. Close to Tirana, the negotiators sought to convince him to let the hostages free. He wounded one and was killed in return by a RENEA sniper. *1999: Zani √áaushi, leader of one of the most ruthless Albanian gangs, was arrested. The same fate befell the senior leaders of many other gangs. *1999: A gang that had held hostage and then released a senior police official was arrested. *1999: Acting on the request of the Italian government, an individual suspected of the murder of three police officers in Udine was arrested. Although exonerated of this murder, the individual remained behind bars due to other criminal activities. *2000-2001: In three separate operations, three individuals sought for the murder of Azem Hajdari, an Albanian MP, were arrested. This mission was important because Hajdari was one of the most unorthodox and controversial leaders of the political opposition at the time. *February 2001: During Operation Journey Italia, RENEA took credit for destroying an Albanian- American gang, which, in partnership with the Medell√≠n drug cartel and Italian and Albanian mafia, was exploring the possibility of turning Albania into a major international launching pad for the trafficking of cocaine. RENEA arrested all suspects, including a former senior police officer. *January 2002: RENEA destroyed a gang of narcotics traffickers, which was trafficking than 100 kg (202.5 lb) heroin per trip. More than 1,000 kg (2,205 lb) of pure heroin was confiscated. *1990-2004: During the last decade and a half, RENEA has provided escort security to such high-level officials as: former United States Secretaries of State James Baker and Madeleine Albright, Pope John Paul II, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, and various Italian and Greek prime ministers, in addition to Albanian officials and international officials in government missions in Albania. * June 2014: RENEA in a combined operation with the Albanian Police put the rogue village of Lazarat under siege for a few weeks. Around 800 officers and police agents took part in the operation. RENEA operatives fought against drug traffickers armed with RPGs, AK-47s and other light weaponry. Dozens were arrested and tons of Marijuana and Heroin were confiscated and burnt. There were no casualties from both sides. *June 2015: For the second year in a row, the village of Lazarat was put under siege after one RENEA operative was killed and two others were wounded. After an intense manhunt, both assailants surrendered. The operation is ongoing. *August 2018: RENEA was involved in a massive manhunt to arrest Ridvan Zykaj who killed 8 people in Vlor√´. He was arrested by RENEA in the morning of 11th of August. *October 2018: RENEA forces kill Greek extremist Kostandinos Kacifa in the village of Bularat of Dropull in Gjirokastra. He had come to the village to commemorate Greek soldiers fallen into the Italian-Greek war. It was Kacifa himself who opened fire on the police, prompting the RENEA forces to intervene; after a shootout, Kacifa was killed on the mountainside over the Bularat water depot. His death was criticized by the Greek Foreign Ministry, calling it \\"unacceptable\\". Casualties Over the years (until 2002) the unit has suffered only 3 casualties: Specialist Lulezim R. Sulollari (1991), Non- commissioned officer Arben N. Ujka (1993), Captain Elam S. Elezi (1998).

A common misconception is the addition of the word \\"Elimination\\" to account for the second \\"E\\". Therefore, the name would get a new meaning: \\"Department of Elimination and Neutralization of Armed Elements\\". In another version (received directly by one of the most representing members of the group previously called \\"repart 326\\") the first \\"e\\" of RENEA stands for \\"Energjike\\".

It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation 2 in 2000, and was subsequently ported to Microsoft Windows and Mac OS the following year. In the game, the player plays the role of Joseph and can assemble a team of compatriots and summon powerful monsters. The game has a world map, involved storyline, and unique hybrid combat system involving real-time and turn-based mechanisms. A sequel, Summoner 2, was released in 2002. After the bankruptcy of publisher THQ in December 2012, the Summoner franchise was acquired by Nordic Games, who have since published Summoner on GOG.com (February 25, 2014) and on Steam Digital Distribution platform (March 12, 2014). Gameplay In addition to the main storyline, there are over twenty side quests that may be completed. Summoner's combat system is a hybrid system incorporating real-time and turn-based combat, with characters essentially \\"taking turns\\" to attack during real-time gameplay. Included within this system is a unique \\"Chain attack\\" mechanic, in which players can extend their \\"turn\\" by performing special melee attacks at the appropriate time. If done correctly, players can \\"chain\\" these special attacks into long sequences, inflicting far greater amounts of damage than they might otherwise have. These special attacks can also have special effects such as inflicting status effects, damaging an enemy's action points or inflicting more health damage than normal. Characters can also acquire and use a variety of special abilities and spells, expending \\"action points\\" in order to use these abilities. The game's Summoning mechanic allows the player to conjure monsters that will serve as additional party members, allowing the player to have a 5-character party instead of a 4-character party. These monsters have their own spells and abilities that they bring into combat, but will go rogue and attack the player's party if Joseph is defeated in combat. Music Scott Lee was the main composer and senior sound designer of Summoner and did most of the game music with Dan Wentz helping on the soundtrack towards the end of development near gold master. Wally Shaw did sound design and some editing of music towards the middle of development. After interplay went bankrupt, Lee provided the first tech demonstration for THQ. During this time Lee and Wentz also worked on the early Descent 4 trailer music, which later rebranded into Red Faction for legal reasons and FreeSpace 2. Reception Blake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"This is PlayStation 2? Unfortunately for the game ‚Äì and the system ‚Äì it's proving all too typical.\\" The PC version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PlayStation 2 version received \\"average\\" reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Sequel A sequel, Summoner 2, was released in 2002. On December 19, 2012, THQ filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy and its properties were auctioned off in individual lots. The Summoner franchise, among other THQ properties including Darksiders and Red Faction, was sold to Nordic Games. Nordic Games have subsequently re-branded and published Summoner to the Steam Digital Distribution Platform.

Biography The Emperor first met Domitila (who was born in S√£o Paulo) in 1822 during his travel through S√£o Paulo which would lead to the Brazilian independence. She was married to Fel√≠cio Pinto Coelho de Mendon√ßa, a military officer of low rank. Crowned emperor, Pedro I invited her to move to Rio de Janeiro and offered her an office at the Court, placing her at the Empress's entourage as her lady-in-waiting. There she managed to have her first marriage nullified. The emperor proved himself very generous when it came to honour his favourite and her family as well. Bestowing on her the title of Viscountess of Santos was a slap in the face of the family of Jos√© Bonif√°cio, the patriarch of the independence and the most eminent people of the city of Santos, S√£o Paulo. He also did not hesitate in bestowing titles on their three daughters (the Duchesses of Goi√°s and Cear√° and the Countess of Igua√ßu) and insisting on their being educated with the royal princesses. The Marchioness' sister was made Baroness of Sorocaba and eventually she joined the extensive roll of royal mistresses, and bore a child with him. Maria Leopoldina, the empress, died in 1826 due to complications caused by a miscarriage. The public opinion held the Marchioness responsible for the grievances and humiliations suffered by the empress. Since marrying Domitila was not an option, Pedro chose for his second marriage the young Bavarian princess Am√©lie de Beauharnais von Leuchtenberg, granddaughter of Empress Josephine. Subsequently, he dismissed Domitila who returned to S√£o Paulo. There she married again, to the brigadier Rafael Tobias de Aguiar. Domitila de Castro died from enterocolitis in her native S√£o Paulo on November 3, 1867, aged 69. Her body was buried in the Cemit√©rio da Consola√ß√£o.

A former Italian international, he spent the majority of his club career with Juventus, where he won several domestic and international trophies, and is now head of its youth system. He represented his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, and at UEFA Euro 2000, reaching the final of the latter tournament. After his retirement in 2006, Pessotto remained at Juventus as a member of the coaching staff. He is currently the Sporting Director (Direttore Sportivo) of the club's youth academy. Pessotto was given the nickname Il Professorino (\\"The Little Professor\\") by the fans, due to his glasses, his interest in philosophy and literature, and as he was able to obtain a law degree during his career. His stamina and ability to run very quickly ‚Äì indeed he was often described as almost \\"flying\\" on field in the media ‚Äì also earned him the nickname \\"Passerotto\\" (\\"Little Sparrow\\"). Club career=Milan Born in Latisana, in the province of Udine, Pessotto started his career in the A.C. Milan youth system. However, he was instantly sold to A.S. Varese 1910 in 1989. He never made a professional appearance for Milan. Varese After joining Varese in 1989, Pessotto officially began his professional career. In two full seasons with the club, he tallied an impressive 64 appearances, also finding the back of the net on a solo occasion. Massese In August 1991, Pessotto transferred to U.S. Massese 1919, although he only remained at the club for one season. in his lone season, he appeared 23 times in the league, netting one goal. Bologna Following impressive spells with both A.S. Varese 1910 and U.S. Massese 1919, he transferred to, then, Serie B club Bologna F.C. 1909 in the summer of 1992. Despite being a highly anticipated transfer, Pessotto made just 21 league appearances, and was sold at the conclusion of the season. He also scored one goal for the Bolognese club. Verona After a season with Bologna in Serie B, Pessotto transferred to fellow Serie B club, Hellas Verona F.C. in 1993. Pessotto was an undisputed starter for much of the season, impressing greatly. He made 34 league appearances with a seasonal career high of 3 goals. Torino After impressing in the second division of Italian football, Pessotto transferred to Torino F.C. in 1994. In his first season in the Serie A, Pessotto racked up a starting position along with 32 league appearances and his first Serie A goal. After greatly impressing in his debut Serie A season, Pessotto moved to city rivals and European giants Juventus, in 1995, in what was a very highly regarded transfer. Juventus After joining Juventus in 1995, Pessotto instantly became a key part of the first team and helped Juventus form what was considered to be one of the best defences in the world at this time, and teams strongly regretted ever going down a goal to the club, as they knew how hard it would be to score one back for themselves. Pessotto formed impressive defensive partnerships with the likes of Ciro Ferrara, Moreno Torricelli, Paolo Montero, Mark Iuliano, Lilian Thuram, Alessandro Birindelli, Igor Tudor, Gianluca Zambrotta, Nicola Legrottaglie, Fabio Cannavaro, Jonathan Zebina, and Giorgio Chiellini during his lengthy 12-year tenure with the club. He was one of many experienced players who had been at Juventus for a lengthy period of time. Injuries and other issues in the closing stages of his career limited his first-team opportunities to mainly being used a substitute to Jonathan Zebina or Lilian Thuram. Pessotto retired at the end of the 2005‚Äì2006 Serie A season, after back to back Scudetti. With Juventus he managed well over 250 total appearances scoring 2 league goals in the process. Among his achievements as a Juventus player, Pessotto won the UEFA Champions League in 1996 (scoring a penalty in Juventus's shoot-out victory over Ajax), playing in 4 Champions League Finals, the UEFA Super Cup in 1996, the Intercontinental Cup in 1996, 1 UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2000, 4 Scudetti (1997, 1998, 2002, 2003) 4 Supercoppa Italiana titles (1997, 1998, 2002, 2003), and 1 Coppa Italia in 1995. International career In total, Pessotto was capped 22 times for Italy between 1996 and 2002, under managers Arrigo Sacchi (1996), Cesare Maldini (1996‚Äì98), Dino Zoff (1998‚Äì2000), and Giovanni Trapattoni (2000‚Äì2002). He played for his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, where Italy were eliminated by hosts and eventual champions France on penalties in the quarter finals, and at Euro 2000. At Euro 2000, Pessotto scored a penalty in the semi-final shootout win over co-hosts the Netherlands, which sent Italy into the final against France. In the final, Pessotto would set up Delvecchio's goal; however, he only picked up a runners-up medal, as Italy lost to France for the second consecutive tournament, after conceding a last minute equaliser, and then subsequently conceding a David Trezeguet golden goal. Trezeguet became his Juventus teammate the following season. He was unable to take part at the 2002 World Cup with Italy due to injury. Style of play Despite initially not being known as the most naturally talented, flashy, or technically gifted footballer, Pessotto was considered to be a promising prospect in his youth, and later made a name for himself as a correct, hard-working, reliable, tactically intelligent, efficient, and versatile utility player, with solid ball control and a good positional sense, who was able to play as an attacking full-back or wing-back, or also as a wide midfielder on either flank. Despite being naturally right-footed, he was capable of playing with either foot, and he usually preferred to play on the left side of the pitch. In this role, he was known for his pace, calm composure, reading of the game, and stamina, as well as his ability to chase and close down opponents, win back the ball with his tackles, and subsequently carry it up the flank, play exchanges with teammates, get forward, and deliver crosses into the area, courtesy of his distribution and ability to make attacking runs, which enabled him to cover the flank effectively. He was also capable of playing as a central or defensive midfielder, and was even used as a centre-back on occasion, due to his consistency, awareness, and man-marking ability. He was also an accurate penalty taker. In spite of his reserved character, his sportsmanship, fair- play attitude, professionalism, discipline, elegant playing style, and gregariousness made him an important, well-liked, and respected figure in the dressing room, among both his teammates and managers. Coaching career Following his retirement, Pessotto was successively appointed as the new Juventus team manager. Alleged suicide attempt Weeks after his retirement as a footballer, he survived a 15-metre fall from a fourth storey window at the headquarters of Juventus, on 27 June 2006. As he was holding a rosary, it is believed that he was attempting suicide in the wake of the Calciopoli scandal which led his club to be stripped of two Serie A titles and relegated in Serie B for their first time in history. He suffered multiple fractures and internal bleeding from the fall. On 17 July 2006, medical staff declared him out of danger and stated that he would not have long-term mental damage or physical paralysis. His wife Reana later declared it had not been a suicide attempt, but that Pessotto had blacked-out.'Pessotto wilde niet dood' - Trouw After recovering Pessotto resumed his managerial duties. In the summer of 2009 he was appointed Primavera (U-20) coach, replacing former teammate Ciro Ferrara, who had been just been named the new first team manager.

Construction displaced the tennis courts and the right field area of the baseball field, currently the site of the auxiliary gym on the west side of the arena. Eight tennis courts were rebuilt on the former baseball infield, west of the arena. The baseball field was not rebuilt as BSU dropped baseball as a varsity sport following the During their final season, the Broncos played home games at Borah Field (now Wigle Field) at Borah High School, west of campus. The arena opened in 1982 as the BSU Pavilion; its first event was BSU's commencement on May 16, followed by graduation ceremonies for the city's public high schools. That August, it hosted an eight-day Billy Graham Crusade, and its first significant sporting event was the 1983 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In April 2017, Boise State ended their wrestling program, which had been using the arena as its home venue. Naming rights The BSU Pavilion received its first naming rights sponsorship in June 2004 with Taco Bell, a fast-food restaurant chain based in Irvine, California; the 15-year agreement with the university was for $4 million and the venue was renamed Taco Bell Arena. At its expiration in 2019, Boise State entered into a new agreement with ExtraMile, a convenience store chain jointly owned by Chevron and Jacksons; the 15-year agreement with the university was for $8.4 million and it was renamed ExtraMile Arena. Basketball tournaments Boise State vs. New Mexico in January 2013 While the Broncos were members, the venue hosted four Big Sky Conference men's basketball tournaments: 1985, 1989, 1990, and 1994. In those four tourneys, BSU made the finals in 1989 and won the title in 1994. ExtraMile Arena has been a familiar site for early-round NCAA Tournament games, hosting first and second round competition nine times (1983, 1989, 1992, 1995, 1998, 2001, 2005, 2009, and 2018). The NCAA tournament is scheduled to return in 2021. In 1995, UCLA guard Tyus Edney dashed the length of the court in just over four seconds to make a layup that gave the Bruins a 75‚Äì74 win over Missouri, which sustained UCLA's run to a national title. In 2001, it was the site of the closest first-round day at a single host location ever, with the four games played on March 15 decided by a combined total of seven points. One was Hampton's upset of #2 seed Iowa State ‚Äî Hampton was only the fourth #15 seed to beat a #2 seed since the tournament expanded from 53 to 64 teams in 1985.

The arena opened in 1987. It is home to the Tennessee Volunteers (men) and Lady Vols (women) basketball teams. Since 2008, it has been home to the Lady Vols volleyball team. It is named after B. Ray Thompson and former university president Dr. Edward J. Boling. The basketball court is named \\"The Summitt\\" after the late Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. It replaced the Stokely Athletic Center. The mammoth octagonal building lies just northwest of the Tennessee River, and just southwest of Neyland Stadium. As an echo of its neighbor and a tribute to the brick-and-mortar pattern atop Ayres Hall, the baselines of the court are painted in the familiar orange-and-white checkerboard pattern. History In terms of seating capacity, Thompson-Boling was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States with a seating capacity of 24,535 until its 2007 renovation. The current capacity is 21,678. The men's record crowd was 25,610 for a game against Kentucky on January 21, 1989, which is also the SEC record for a regular-season game. The Lady Vols' record crowd of 24,653, set at their win over archrival UConn on January 7, 2006, is also the all-time record for an NCAA regular-season women's game. The facility hosted the 1989 Southeastern Conference men's basketball tournament. It hosted games of the NCAA men's basketball tournament in 1990 (first and second rounds), 1994 (regional), and 1999 (regional), and the 1990 NCAA Women's Final Four. Since 2001, it has played host to Knoxville's Living Christmas Tree. In August 2006, ground was broken for the Pratt Pavilion, a basketball practice facility to be located adjacent to the arena. It was ready for use in early November, but not all exterior construction were finished. On November 30, 2006, plans were announced at utsports.com to add new renovations to Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena. Renovations included black seats, a center hung scoreboard, and concourse refurbishments, such as graphics and other amenities. Also added were luxury suites and loge seating. Construction began in March 2007. Phase I was finished in late October 2007 with an opening game against the Temple Owls of the Atlantic 10 Conference. Phase II is scheduled to include a new lighting system, new ticket kiosks, and new food courts. The outer volume of Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena is approximately . During the 2006‚Äì2007 and the 2007‚Äì2008 year, the University of Tennessee Men's Basketball team went 16‚Äì0 in Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena. As of November 18, 2008, Bruce Pearl's home record at Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena was 47‚Äì2, a home winning percentage at Tennessee of 96%. On February 5, 2009, history was made at Thompson‚ÄìBoling Arena, as the Tennessee Lady Vols defeated the Georgia Bulldogs 73‚Äì43, to give head coach Pat Summitt her 1,000th win. It is also a concert venue, holding up to 25,000 people. It has been Tennessee's largest arena since it was opened.

G. Collingwood In Norse Mythology, √ìttar, also known as √ìttar the Simple, is a prot√©g√© of the goddess Freyja. He appeared in Hyndlulj√≥√∞ (the Lay of Hyndla), a poem in the Poetic Edda. In this tale, √ìttar is said to be very pious to the goddesses. He built a shrine of stones, a h√∂rgr, and on it made many offerings to Freyja. The goddess answered his prayers and went on a journey to help him find his pedigree. Freyja disguised √ìttar as her boar Hildisvini (the Battle-Swine) and brought him to the giantess Hyndla, a seeress. There, Freyja forced Hyndla to tell √ìttar about his ancestors, as well as to give him a memory potion so that he would remember all that he was told. It has been theorized that the framework of the poem was created for the 12th-century poet to produce a list of mythical heroes' names.

Huntsman Center is a 15,000-seat indoor arena in the western United States, on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. It is the home of the Utah Utes of the Pac-12 Conference, the primary venue for basketball and gymnastics. History Opened in late 1969 as the Special Events Center, it succeeded Nielsen Fieldhouse as the campus' primary indoor arena. It was renamed in 1987 in honor of chemicals entrepreneur and philanthropist Jon M. Huntsman father of Utah's former governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. From its opening until the completion of the Vivint Smart Home Arena in 1991 (as \\"Delta Center\\"), the Huntsman Center was one of Salt Lake City's premier sports and entertainment venues (along with the Salt Palace the home of the Utah Stars (ABA) and Utah Jazz (NBA)). Architecturally, it was once known for its steel cloud, which hung from the arena's silver dome interior. The steel cloud held the arena's center court scoreboard, sound and lighting systems. The scoreboard was upgraded in the 1980s with the addition of state-of-the-art rear projection video screens. The rear projection system was upgraded in 1995, and replaced in 2006 by four LED video screens. In 2014, the arena was renovated again. The $6 million project removed the steel cloud, as well as added a new floor, LED lights, sound system, drapes, and two grand entrances to house a Hall of Fame and Legacy Hall. On May 12, 1973, The Jackson 5 performed at the center.Cadman, Chris. Michael Jackson: The Maestro. Pg. 668 The facility hosted the 1989 Western Athletic Conference men's basketball tournament. In addition to athletics and concerts, the arena has hosted many academic and intellectual events over the years, such as a public lecture by renowned British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking in 1995, which was reported to be the largest live audience that Hawking had ever addressed at that time. The facility hosted two games of the Utah Jazz Summer League in 2016 due to a concert at Vivint Smart Home Arena. In 2017, the Utah Jazz Summer League moved to the Huntsman Center for all six games & four teams due to the Vivint Smart Home Arena undergoing renovations. The 15,000-seat multi-purpose arena is home to the University of Utah's \\"Runnin' Utes\\" basketball teams (men's and women's), \\"Red Rocks\\" women's gymnastics team and women's volleyball team. It also hosts concerts, mostly second-tier acts; most premier concerts have been hosted at Vivint Smart Home Arena (Delta Center). Utah joined the Pac-12 in 2011 and the Huntsman Center became the largest arena in the conference. The elevation at street level is approximately above sea level, second-highest in the Pac-12. NCAA tournament The Huntsman Center hosted the first and second rounds of the NCAA Tournament 12 times (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2006). It hosted the West Regional Final twice (1971, 1981) and one Final Four (1979). Due to the frequency of hosting first and second round games, the Huntsman Center is third all-time in NCAA Tournament games hosted, with 81. Since 2010, NCAA tournament games in the city have been played at Vivint Smart Home Arena, home of the NBA's Utah Jazz. Other venues for past NCAA games in the state include the Marriott Center in Provo and the Dee Events Center in Ogden. 1979 Final Four The arena hosted the 1979 Final Four in late March, featuring the start of the rivalry between all-time greats Magic Johnson and Magic's Michigan State team defeated Bird's previously unbeaten Indiana State in the which remains the most-watched college basketball game in history. Many observers consider the Magic-Bird rivalry established here and carried into the NBA when both entered the league that fall to be a major factor in the league's 1980s renaissance.

History and construction NASCAR committed to building a Hall of Fame and on March 6, 2006, the City of Charlotte was selected as the location. Ground was broken for the $160 million facility on January 26, 2007, and it officially opened on May 11, 2010, with the inaugural class inducted the day following the 2010 NASCAR Sprint All-Star Race. The new Hall of Fame brings hundreds of jobs and an increase in tourism to Charlotte. In addition to the Hall of Fame, the NASCAR Plaza, a 20-story office building, opened in May 2009. The structure serves as the home of Hall of Fame-related offices, NASCAR Digital Media, NASCAR's licensing division, as well as NASCAR video game licensee Dusenberry Martin Racing (now known as 704Games). Other tenants include the Charlotte Regional Partnership and Lauth Property Group. Richard Petty and Dale Inman helped unveil the first artifact at the Hall of Fame‚Äîthe Plymouth Belvedere that Petty drove to 27 wins in 1967. The City of Charlotte was responsible for the construction of the building and is the owner of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. However, it is operated by the Charlotte Regional Visitors Authority. Winston Kelley is the NASCAR Hall of Fame executive director. Internationally renowned Pei Cobb Freed & Partners led the design effort, and Leslie E. Robertson Associates were the structural engineers. Little Diversified Architectural Consulting based in Charlotte is the local architectural firm overseeing many aspects of design and construction of the project. LS3P Associates, Ltd. was the associate architect for the office tower. Tobin Starr + Partners served as site architect, providing full-time representation for Pei Cobb Freed & Partners during construction. Engineering and fabrication of the stainless steel m√∂bius that wraps around the structure was completed by Zahner, of Kansas City. Exhibition design is by Ralph Appelbaum Associates, and exhibition lighting by Technical Artistry. Tobin Starr + Partners is architect-of-record for exhibit and auditorium spaces. Jaros, Baum & Bolles (JB&B;) was the mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineer. Site excavation and grading services started on May 21, 2007. The facility features a Hall of Fame and a 19-story office tower. The NASCAR Hall of Fame is set on a 150,000 square feet surface. In June 2008, NASCAR announced that the inauguration is planned on May 11, 2010. In 2009, NASCAR Hall of Fame established a partnership with Buffalo Wild Wings to be its exclusive restaurant partner in Charlotte. Site selection CATS Stonewall Station (May 2009) Because of stock car racing's roots in and wealth of famous drivers from North Carolina, Charlotte was considered the favorite by many fans and commentators. There are many NASCAR offices in the area and many teams in the three major NASCAR series (Cup, Xfinity and Truck Series) totaling over 73% of motorsports employees in the United States, in what the committee called \\"NASCAR Valley.\\" The Hall of Fame is in Uptown Charlotte, about 25 minutes south of Charlotte Motor Speedway. The bid was led by NASCAR car owner Rick Hendrick, then Mayor Pat McCrory, and business leaders in Charlotte. Pei Cobb Freed & Partners were enlisted to design the complex, which is near the Charlotte Convention Center. Hall of Fame building The building contains the following: Glory Road *First Floor: **High Octane Theater ‚Äì A screening room below ground level which shows videos to guests, including a primer video for first-time visitors. *Second Floor: **Ceremonial Plaza ‚Äì An outdoor \\"patio\\" with a video screen. **Glory Road ‚Äì A 33-degree banked ramp (matching that of Talladega Superspeedway) featuring 18 different cars and saluting 46 past and current tracks. **The Great Hall ‚Äì Dubbed as the Times Square of the hall, a -by- video screen and rotating exhibits will be staged here. **\\"Studio 43\\" ‚Äì Named in honor of Richard Petty's car number ‚Äì used for television production. *Third Floor: **Hall of Honor ‚Äì A 360-degree wall with the honorees enshrined serves as the centerpiece of the building with each enshrinee with their own exhibit. **Transporter and Racecar Simulators ‚Äì Simulators provided by iRacing.com. **Inside NASCAR ‚Äì Simulates an actual week in a NASCAR team, from race prep through inspection, practice, time trials and the race. *Fourth Floor: **Heritage Speedway ‚Äì The seven decade history of NASCAR is focused here, including a glass-enclosed section with historic artifacts from the history of stock car racing. There is a gift shop, the Hall of Fame Caf√© and a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant on site. An expansion, which includes a new ballroom, is part of the project. While most information on the Charlotte bid has been released voluntarily, the Charlotte Observer has asked the state Attorney General for an opinion requiring full disclosure of the financial details. The self-proclaimed slogan used by Charlotte for the Hall of Fame was \\"Racing Was Built Here. Racing Belongs Here.\\" Other final candidates The other two cities at the time of the announcement that were in the running were the cities of Atlanta and Daytona Beach. =Other bids= The state of Alabama had been mentioned as a potential candidate location, and was no longer seen as a contender, possibly because Lincoln, Alabama is home to the International Motorsports Hall of Fame, which is not affiliated with NASCAR. The only northern area that considered bidding was in the state of Michigan. Detroit prepared bids, but state officials decided not to submit the proposals. The cities of Richmond, Virginia and Kansas City, Kansas, were among the five finalists, but on January 5, 2006, NASCAR announced they had been eliminated from the running, leaving just Atlanta, Charlotte and Daytona Beach as the remaining cities. Eligibility and selection process=Eligibility Former drivers must have been active in NASCAR for at least 10 years and retired for at least three. Starting with the 2015 Hall of Fame nominations that were voted in the 2014 nomination process, the three-year rule is waived for drivers who compete in 30 or more years in NASCAR-sanctioned competition or turn 55 years of age. The rule applies to all NASCAR-sanctioned competitions; some drivers in the Hall of Fame did not participate in the Cup Series. Non-drivers must have been involved in the industry at least ten years. Some candidates with shorter careers will be considered if there were special circumstances. Selection process Hall of Honor, where the inductees are enshrined =Nomination= A 20-member nominating committee chooses nominees from those who are eligible.

The company's specialty was usually cars and trucks in tin, plastic and diecast. The company went bankrupt in 1976 but was reorganized in 1993 and then totally independent again by 1996. History Originally named Spielzeugfirma Schreyer & Co, the company changed its name to the more succinct Schuco in 1921 (likely a derivation of Schreyer und Company; see Knox 2002, p. 4; Rixon 2005, p. 64). At its beginnings, the company made unique clockwork tin toys (Johnson 1998, p. 210). Some of these were clever in that, instead of using a key, one would wind an arm or another feature (King 1986, p. 173). In the 1920s Schuco introduced its famous Pick-Pick bird (over 20 million were made up until the 1960s). A wind-up mouse, a dancing mouse and trotting dog wearing a cape were other popular offerings (King 1986, p. 173). Before World War II there were also a number of 'gnome'-like wind-up figures and soldiers sometimes called blacksmiths ‚Äì finished in creative colorful attire. Schuco Motodrill motorcycle made3 in the zone of U.S. occupation in West Germany about 1950. Pre-War vehicles In 1935 one of the first Schuco patent motor cars was produced, starting a legacy of producing toy motor vehicles that have usually been the company's main offering. Schuco toy lines always had some special quality or gimmick to attract collectors as well as children. Around 1938, production was begun on tin cars that were made either with clockwork motors or 'telesteering' where the toy could be steered through a small steering wheel attached to the car with a wire (Schuco 3000 No date). Schuco 'Studio' cars had a starting crank, removable wheels, varied gearing and rack and pinion steering. Cars came with miniature tool kits. Probably because the Schuco name ended in \\"o\\", this started a tradition of naming vehicle lines and sets with a somewhat male, Italian-sounding \\"o\\" at the end. Thus, Studio, Piccolo, and Varianto. One notable Studio car was the Luigi Fagioli Auto Union Avus 'Streamline', built in 1937, which came in a detailed box, complete with tools. Only 1,000 were produced. Schuco 'Turn Back' cars had a metal pin sensor that made the car turn when approaching the edge of a table (King 1986, p. 173). Wooden pegs were actually provided with the toy so the car could be driven around them. The Schuco 'Command 2000' car was voice activated, by speaking loudly or blowing through louvres in the roof, it would start or stop on command (MAAS n.d.). Post-War directions A Schuco Varianto gift pack with track. Toy production was halted during the devastation of World War II. In the late 1940s, Schuco again began tin toy assembly ‚Äì this time focusing a bit more on the broader European and international market. Tin toys were larger scale ‚Äì in the neighborhood of 1:24 to 1:18. During the 1950s there was a shift to plastic (especially for larger scales) and diecast metal, introduced in the Piccolo series in 1958, became commonplace for models in the early 1970s. Model types were varied and continued to include remote control and wind-up toys. Toy scales were always widely varied starting with HO (1:87) up to a foot long or larger (about 1:12). Post-war cars during the 1950s mimicked real cars but were most often generic ‚Äì some Schucos looked like Kaiser-Frazers, BMW 328s, Buick sedans, or Porsches, but these names were never used for the toys until the Mercedes Elektro Phanomenal was introduced in 1955. By the mid-1960s, most cars were given specific brand names of actual automobiles (see the gradual transformation in Knox 2002, pp. 30‚Äì49). Varianto Various examples of the Schuco Varianto lineup. Notice the very rare 3048 Patrol car in the lower right corner. The Schuco Varianto wire-track system was introduced in 1951. The company's advertisements stated, \\"The automatic traffic game featuring a new kind of wire track never seen before.\\" The clockwork or battery-operated cars had a guide wheel on the underside that set within coiled wire tracks. The tracks could be arranged in various configurations of the owner's own design. Different plastic pieces could be linked with the wire track to create intersections and overpasses. The Varianto system was sold for fifteen years and was immensely popular as a much cheaper alternative to electric train sets, having similar features and limited in layout only by the owner's imagination (Keus No Date; Schuco Varianto 2011). Piccolos Edward Force wrote that Schuco's first consistent foray into diecast toys was in 1958 when the 1:90 scale 'Piccolo' series was introduced (Force 1990, pp. 216, 219). These solid metal (and heavy) cars were accurate, yet mildly cartoonish at the same time. Piccolos were solid cast metal without plastic windows nor did they have interiors. Piccolos are highly collectible today, whether the original models or the later Schuco reproductions. More than 100 different Piccolos have been produced, some in many liveries, like the VW transporter van (Lilliput 2009). Micro Racers and Old Timers With a windup key, the 1:45 scale Micro Racer cars would zip around, yet could also be pushed forward or backward without harming the wind-up mechanism. The \\"micro\\" name came from the \\"micro\\" ‚Äì threaded steering which could be precisely adjusted (Lilliput 2009). 'Old Timers' had specialized clock-work motors. When wound up and in neutral, the cars would shake and vibrate. Shift the car into gear and off they roll ‚Äì the direction chosen by how the steering wheel was turned (Sinclair's 1983). Examples of cars in this series were a Ford Model T, a Mercedes Simplex, or a Mercer 35J. In addition, remote, drive-by-wire \\"telesteering\\" was seen on earlier, larger scale cars. Larger Scales Larger cars made during the 1970s were equally impressive and usually focused on German products (Rixon 2005, p. 76). The 1:12 scale BMW 3.0 CSL Coupe in racing colors had switches to turn on and off head, tail and hazard lamps. A lever on the steering column operated the turn signals. The instrument panel was illuminated. The model had working steering (Sinclair 1976). A 1:16 scale Porsche 911 was cleverly equipped with an electric horn that sounded with two tones and a set of studded rally tires that could be placed on the vehicle after raising it with a functioning jack. The car, similar to the BMW, ran with a smooth electric motor forward and reverse and also had working steering (Sinclair's 1976). Schuco's 1:16 scale Formula 2 Brabham Ford BT33 and Formula 2 Ferrari were made in the early 1970s and very nicely detailed with many pressed metal pieces including very authentic looking wheels and tires. They had electric motors for both forward power and steering. Traditional diecast Models in 1:43 scale (the 1000 series) were introduced in 1960. In 1971 and 1972, a new 1:43 scale was introduced (the 600 line) and the first 1:66 Matchbox-sized 300 series appeared. The smaller cars were called \\"Super Schnell\\" (Super Fast), which after translation from German seems essentially identical to the wording used by Matchbox. As seen, other diecast and remote control vehicles were sometimes much larger. Schuco's diecast 1:43 scale line in the 1970s was extremely precise in detail with near perfect proportion to the real cars. Usually all features opened. Paint application seemed more refined and not as thick as with British Corgis and Dinkys. As might be expected, most models were German makes: Volkswagen, Porsche, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW. Accurate replication was as good as Solido and the earlier Politoys M series, and better than most Gamas or Conrads. Precision was perhaps on par with later NZG Mercedes and Porsche promotionals. Also, similar to Solido, Schuco avoided the attractive but less realistic jewels for head and tail lights. Alas, when the company comes up with near-perfect models ‚Äì financial troubles arrive (Force 1990, p. 210). Schuco lines Some of the popular Schuco toy lines (often ending in -o) have been: Command Car, Magico Series, Radio Series, Patent Series, Piccolo Series, Fex 1111, Mirako Series, Telesteering cars, Examinco Series, Akustico Series, Ingenico Series, Elektro Phanomenal, Dally cars, Grand Prix Racers, Studio series, Varianto System, Old Timers, Micro Racers, Motorcycle range, Elektro Radiant Airplanes. Financial woes and casting seconds Schuco went bankrupt in 1976. An English company Dunbee-Combex-Marx (DCM) acquired Schuco (or large parts of it), but it too went bankrupt in 1980. Eventually, rival German toymaker Gama Toys, acquired the rights to Schuco in the mid 1980s, and, for a time, new Gama Toys were 1:43 scale Schucos put directly into Gama boxes ‚Äì with no name change on the base of the vehicle. Whether these were newly cast cars with no change in lettering, or leftover stock is uncertain. In the U.S. during the 1980s, Schuco toys were marketed by the Lilliput Motor Company of Yerington, Nevada, with the Lilliput name appearing prominently on the colorful Schuco-style boxes (Johnson 1998, p. 210) Edward Force writes that about the time of the Gama purchase, Schuco dies were sold off to many other companies in different countries (Force 1990, pp. 218‚Äì219). Some even appeared with \\"Made in Russia\\" on their bases. The MIR Toy factory in Mir, Bulgaria (later to become Mikro'67 (see website link below), reproduced at least 16 different Schuco vehicles through the 1990s, in several colors. Sometimes they were packaged with \\"Made in Germany\\" still marked on their bases ‚Äì but after a time this labeling was removed. Some Schuco model castings then appeared as Gamas; some went to France and became Norevs, and some went to Brazil and were sold by Rei (Force 1990, p. 218). Revival In 1993 Gama-Schuco combined with Trix, a maker of small ('N') scale trains, and a company previously associated with M√§rklin. In 1996, Schuco became independent again and saw a revival, producing a wide variety of collectible models, with many newly designed castings, but many being exact replicas of earlier lines. In 1999, Schuco was acquired by the Simba Dickie Group and model boxes were labeled with stickers saying \\"Dickie Schuco\\" even if it was old inventory. Simba Dickie had previously absorbed Smoby which had previously purchased French Majorette which in turn had acquired Solido. Majorette and Solido were apparently spun off, but by 2009, Schuco was healthy enough to acquire Schabak. Today Schuco makes a variety of models (mainly street vehicles) in different scales. There are classic and newer lines, all accurately detailed. For example, the classic BMW 2000 sedan has a multi- colored interior, very tiny logo decals on the centers of the wheels, and more realistic clear plastic lights. One author wrote that the Schuco 2000's appearance was crisp because there were no opening features ‚Äì which often causes the mismatching of body panels (Doty 1999, 88‚Äì89). The company also became involved, in the early 2000s, in the production of promotional models for GM (Opel and Vauxhall) in 1:43 scale. These were done in authentic GM colors and interior styles with authentic dark flat gray window trim (Rixon 2005, p. 64). Changes in the parent company caused the name to change to Dickie Spielzeug GmbH (Schuco milestones 2016). Under Dickie, the quality of the models is superior to the average toy model vehicles, therefore unit prices are higher as well. References *Doty, Dennis. 1999.

His primary contribution to ecclesiastical practice was the introduction of litanies prior to Ascension Day as an intercession against earthquakes and other disasters, leading to \\"Rogation Days.\\" His feast day is the first of the Ice Saints.  Life  Prior to his elevation to the see of Vienne, little has been recorded about Mamertus' life. The fact that his brother, Claudianus Mamertus, the theological writer, received in his youth a sound training in rhetoric, and enjoyed the personal acquaintance of Bishop Eucherius of Lyons (434-50), suggests that the brothers belonged to a wealthy Gallic family from the neighbourhood of Lyons. Like his brother, St Mamertus was distinguished for his secular learning as well as theology, and, before his elevation to the episcopate, appears to have been married. His election and consecration took place shortly before 462. As bishop he enlisted the services of his brother, who had withdrawn to a cloister, and ordained him priest of Vienne. The activity of the brothers is described in one letter of Sidonius Apollinaris,Sidonius, Epist., IV, xi while another is addressed to Bishop Mamertus.Epist., VII, 1 In 463, Mamertus was engaged in a dispute with Pope Hilarius on the question of the privileges of the Bishop of Arles. Pope Leo I had regulated the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces of Arles and Vienne: under the latter he left the Dioceses of Valence, Tarentaise, Geneva and Grenoble, but all the other dioceses in this district were made subordinate to Arles. Regardless of this decision and infringing on the rights of his colleague of Arles, Mamertus consecrated in 463 a bishop for the city of Die (Dea). King Gundioc of the Burgundians complained to Pope Hilary of this action, whereupon the latter wrote to Bishop Leontius of Arles on 10 October 463, bidding him summon a synod of bishops from the different provinces to enquire into the matter. In a subsequent letter to the bishops of the Roman provinces of Lyons, Vienne, Narbonnensis I and II and Alpina, he also refers to the matter, and directs them to obey Leontius's summons to a regularly constituted synod.Thiel, \\"Epist. Rom. Pont.\\", I, cxlvi, cli; Jaff√©, \\"Regesta Rom. Pont.\\", I, 2nd ed., dlvi, dlix The synod decided against Mamertus, as we learn from another letter of the pope dated 25 February, 464.Thiel, op. cit., I, cxlviii; Jaff√©, op. cit., I, dlvii In this letter, St Hilary declares that Mamertus and the bishop unlawfully consecrated by him should really be deposed; desiring, however that clemency be used, he commissioned Bishop Veranus to inform Mamertus that, if he did not recognize and submit to the regulations of Pope Leo, he would be deprived also of the four suffragan dioceses, still subject to Vienne. The bishop invalidly installed by Mamertus was to be confirmed in his office by Leontius, after which he might retain the bishopric. Mamertus evidently submitted, since we find no subsequent reference to the incident. During his episcopate, the remains of St. Ferreolus were discovered, and were translated by Mamertus to a church in Vienne, built in honour of that martyr.Gregory of Tours, \\"De gloria mart.\\", II, ii St. Mamertus was the founder of the Rogation Processions, according to Sidonius Apollinaris,Sidonius, Epist., V, xiv; VII, i and his second successor, Avitus\\"Homilia de Rogat.\\" in P. L., LIX, 289-94 In connexion with these intercessory processions, Mamertus summoned a synod at Vienne between 471 and 475. About 475 he attended a synod at Arles, which dealt with the predestination teaching of Lucidus, a Gallic priest. As this is the latest information we possess concerning him, we may assume that he died shortly afterwards. William of Auxerre (d. 1231) says that Mamertus instituted the litanies after \\"a plague of wolves. For just as is told in the Gospel, that demons, by God's permission and on account of the sins of men, entered pigs, similarly they entered wolves in order to hurt and kill people better, not only in villages but even in cities.\\"William of Auxerre, Summa de Officiis Ecclesiasticis 3.84.1 Veneration After his death he was venerated as a saint. Saint Mamertus' name stands in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum and in the Martyrologium of Florus of Lyons under May 11, on which day his liturgical feast day is still celebrated (Henri Quentin, Les martyrologes historiques, 348) in the Roman Catholic Church.

As president of the Texas State Historical Association, he launched the project that produced the Handbook of Texas. He is also noted for his early criticism of the water usage patterns in the region. In 2012, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Biography Webb was reared on his family farm in Carthage in rural Panola County, Texas. After graduating from Ranger High School in Ranger in Eastland County, he earned a teaching certificate and taught at several Texas schools. He eventually attended the University of Texas at Austin and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1915 at the age of twenty-seven. He worked as bookkeeper in San Marcos and optometrist's assistant in San Antonio, then in 1918 he was invited to join the history faculty at the University of Texas. He wrote his Master of Arts thesis on the Texas Rangers in 1920 and was encouraged to pursue his PhD. After a year of study at the University of Chicago, he returned to Austin, where he began a historical work on the West. The result of this work was The Great Plains, published in 1931, hailed as great breakthrough in the interpretation of the history of the region, and declared the outstanding contribution to American history since World War I by the Social Science Research Council in 1939. He was awarded his PhD for his work on The Great Plains in 1932, the year after its publication. In 1939‚Äì1946 he served as president of the Texas State Historical Association. During his tenure as president, he launched a project to produce an encyclopedia of Texas, which was subsequently published in 1952 as the Handbook of Texas. The world wide web version of the work is a popular Internet reference tool on the state. In all, Webb wrote or edited more than 20 books. One of them, The Texas Rangers (1935) was considered the definitive study of the legendary Texas Rangers and its Captain Bill McDonald. In 1958 Webb served as president of the American Historical Association. Walter Prescott Webb grave at Texas State Cemetery in Austin, Texas Webb's father-in-law was the Confederate States Army veteran and Austin, Texas-based photographer William J. Oliphant (1845‚Äì1930). Webb was killed in an automobile accident near Austin. He was interred at Texas State Cemetery in Austin on the proclamation of then Governor John B. Connally, Jr. At the time of his death he was working on a television series on American civilization under a grant from the Ford Foundation. In his honor the University of Texas established the Walter Prescott Webb Chair of History and Ideas. The position is currently held by Philippa Levine. Webb Middle School in Austin, Texas is also named after him. Ideas Rundell (1963) has examined Webb's main books to see what inspired and prompted the writing of each, what the purpose and message of each seems to be, and Webb's emergent philosophy of history. The professional reception of these studies was also considered. The message of The Great Plains (1931) is contained in its subtitle 'A Study in Institutions and Environment.' Its primary purpose was to present representative ideas about the region rather than to write its history. Webb called the settled area of Europe 'the Metropolis' and the rest of the world 'the Great Frontier', claiming that \\"the Great Plains environment... constitutes a geographic unity whose influences have been so powerful as to put a characteristic mark upon everything that survives within its borders\\", pointing to the revolver, barbed wire, and the windmill as essential to its settlement. He claims that the 98th meridian constitutes an \\"institutional fault\\", with \\"practically every institution that was carried across it... either broken and remade or else greatly altered\\". The book was hailed as one of the top contributions to Am. history since World War I by the Social Science Research Council in 1939. Webb's The Texas Rangers (1935) was a pungent and learned treatment of a frontier institution, but is regarded by many modern historians as an apologia for border violence perpetuated by Rangers against Mexican-Americans. The economic domination of the North, through the tariff, Civil War pensions, and patent monopolies, and the development of the centralized economy dominated by 200 major corporations (over the South and West, which contained the largest share of natural resources) was the theme of Divided We Stand (1937). More Water for Texas (1954) popularized and vitalized a federal study of what he regarded as the most serious problem of his state. The Webb thesis focused on the fragility of the Western environment, pointing out the aridity of the territory and the dangers of an industrialized West. In 1951 Webb published The Great Frontier, proposing the Boom Hypothesis, that the new lands discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 ran out by 1900, closing the frontier and giving the U.S. economic and ecological problems, threatening the future of individualism, capitalism, and democracy. The book caused a firestorm of controversy. O'Har (2006) shows that in his classic interdisciplinary history of the post-Civil War West, Webb develops dominant characteristics of the Great Plains ‚Äì treelessness, level terrain, and semiaridity ‚Äì and examines effect on the lives of people from very different environments. To succeed, pioneers made radical readjustments in their way of life, eschewed traditions, and altered social institutions. Webb believed what set the Great Plains apart from other regions was its individualism, innovation, democracy, and lawlessness, themes he derived from the Frontier Thesis of Frederick Jackson Turner. His focus is said to have missed the emergence of a national empire, and others criticize him for failing to acknowledge the roles played by women, Indians, and Mexicans. Water Webb was an esteemed historian when he wrote an article in the May 1957 edition of Harper's entitled \\"The American West, Perpetual Mirage\\". In the article, Webb criticized U.S. water policy in the West, stating that the region was \\"a semidesert with a desert heart\\", and that it was a national folly to continue to follow the current federal policy (managed through the United States Bureau of Reclamation) of attempting to convert the region into productive cropland through irrigation. Webb's criticism of federal policy was roundly rebuked at the time, but some contemporary critics of U.S. water policy regard him as prophetic in his views.

It is currently home to the AHL's Rockford IceHogs hockey team. The arena formerly served as the home of several defunct minor league sports teams, including the Rockford Lightning basketball team, the Rock River Raptors indoor football team, and the Rockford Rampage indoor soccer team. The BMO Harris Bank Center also secured a spot in history when it hosted the first Arena Football League test game in 1986 between the Chicago Politicians and the Rockford Metros. Due to its outdoor appearance, it is often referred to as the \\"Big Orange Box\\", although IceHogs officials refer to the arena as \\"the Barnyard\\". History The opening night gala in 1981 was headlined by Bob Hope and Lynda Carter. Certainly the most significant event in BMO Harris Bank Center history occurred in the inaugural year, when The Rolling Stones made an appearance on their 1981 North American Tour on October 1, 1981. The concert was added to the tour in response to a radio station petition drive. The actual petitions were cut up and used to hold a lottery for the right to buy tickets. Each person drawn could purchase two of the $15 tickets. The facility hosted the 1984 and 1986 Mid-American Conference men's basketball tournaments as well as numerous IHSA basketball sectional and super-sectional tournaments. In addition to athletic events, it hosts concerts, conventions, and local high school graduations. Arena information The BMO Harris Bank Center hosts major concerts, sport events, and other large-scale events. The complex houses press boxes, a lounge, and suites to watch sport events in style, and a multi- purpose arena. Naming rights On August 11, 2011 it was announced that BMO Harris Bank had reached a long term agreement with the Rockford IceHogs for the naming rights of the venue. It was effectively renamed the BMO Harris Bank Center. Renovations In 2006, the city of Rockford, along with Winnebago County, announced plans to issue $23 million in bonds to fund a massive renovation of the Arena. Key to the plan was an agreement with the Chicago Blackhawks to put an American Hockey League (AHL) team in Rockford for the next 10 years. This team acts as the Blackhawks' farm team. The MetroCentre authority purchased an AHL franchise, and bought the rights to name it the \\"IceHogs.\\" During the summer of 2013, the seating structure in the building's lower level was replaced, making way for a new, updated seating system. New seats were added and the seating capacity for hockey increased to 5,895, up from 5,767. Along with new seats, the visitors' locker room was also expanded. New lights were added and the concourse was renovated.

At the time of acquisition, it operated sixteen casino properties, located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, and a horse track in Texas. History Pinnacle Entertainment traced its roots to June 10, 1938, when movie mogul Jack L. Warner opened the Hollywood Park Turf Club racetrack in Inglewood, California. The original shareholders included Hollywood figures such as Walt Disney, Mervyn LeRoy and Bing Crosby. The company was incorporated and renamed in 1981 as Hollywood Park Realty Enterprises. It was renamed as Hollywood Park, Inc. in 1992. After many years in the horse racing business, the company began a transformation into a casino operator. In 1997, the company acquired Boomtown, Inc. and its three casinos in Nevada, Louisiana and Mississippi for $188 million. In 1998, it acquired Casino Magic Corp. for $340 million, including two casinos in Mississippi, one in Louisiana and a controlling stake in two casinos in Argentina. The company sold the Hollywood Park racetrack in 1999 to Churchill Downs, Inc. and in 2000 changed its name to Pinnacle Entertainment. Belterra Casino Resort & Spa made its debut in 2000 as Pinnacle's first company-designed and developed gaming resort. Then in 2005, Pinnacle opened L'Auberge du Lac in Lake Charles, Louisiana. In September 2006, Pinnacle agreed to purchase the Sands Casino Hotel in Atlantic City, New Jersey and announced plans to replace it with a $1.5-billion resort. The property closed on November 11, 2006 and was demolished on October 18, 2007. Harsh economic times later caused Pinnacle to delay construction of the new resort.Pinnacle's AC casino plans on 'indefinite' hold, Forbes, November 7, 2008. In February 2010, the company announced that it had canceled its construction plans and would instead seek to sell the land.\\"Pinnacle folds its hand in Atlantic City\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, February 6, 2010. Eventually it was sold in 2013 for $29.5 million to a group of local developers who planned to build a casino or family entertainment attraction. In December 2006, Pinnacle purchased the President Casino in St. Louis, Missouri. Lumi√®re Place opened in downtown St. Louis in December 2007, anchoring an entertainment district including the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis and HoteLumi√®re. In March 2010, Pinnacle opened River City Casino, in Lemay, Missouri. Pinnacle announced the expansion of its L‚ÄôAuberge Baton Rouge project in September 2010 and held a grand opening on September 1, 2012. On November 9, 2009, chief executive officer Dan Lee was forced out by the company's board of directors after reportedly physically confronting and threatening a St. Louis County official. In July 2010, the company sold its Argentina casinos for $40 million. In January 2011, Pinnacle purchased River Downs Racetrack in southeast Cincinnati. The company agreed in April 2012 to buy a 75.5% stake in Retama Park, a money-losing horse track in Selma, Texas, for $22.8 million. The purchase was seen as a \\"defensive move\\" to help soften the blow if gaming in Texas were expanded and drew visitors away from Pinnacle's Lake Charles properties. In May 2011, Pinnacle expanded into the Asian gaming market with a $95-million investment for 26 percent ownership of Asian Coast Development Ltd., the owner and developer of the Ho Tram Strip, 80 miles away from Ho Chi Minh City in southern Vietnam, which will be the country‚Äôs first large-scale integrated destination resort. Upon the closing of the transaction, Pinnacle would enter into a management agreement through 2058 for the second integrated resort on the Ho Tram Strip. On June 26, 2012, Pinnacle sold Boomtown Reno for $12.9 million to M1 Gaming, the company of former Station Casinos executive Dean DiLullo. On August 14, 2013, Pinnacle bought Ameristar Casinos for $869 million plus $1.9 billion in assumed debt, adding nine properties in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Mississippi and Northern Nevada. To gain FTC approval for the merger, Pinnacle agreed to sell its Lumiere Place property and Ameristar's under-construction casino in Lake Charles. In November 2014, Pinnacle announced a plan to spin-off a real estate investment trust with the real estate assets of its 15 casinos. Gaming and Leisure Properties (GLPI) then approached Pinnacle with an offer to buy those assets, which it said would be simpler and faster than Pinnacle's plan. Pinnacle did not respond to the offer, so GLPI went public with its offer in March 2015. In July, the companies reached a deal for GLPI to buy 14 of Pinnacle's 15 properties for $4.75 billion in stock, and lease them back to Pinnacle, with rent starting at $377 million per year. The sale would be executed by Pinnacle spinning off a new company, also named Pinnacle Entertainment, with the casinos' operating businesses, along with ownership of Belterra Park (formerly River Downs) and the company's interest in Retama Park; GLPI would then acquire the original Pinnacle Entertainment. The sale was completed in April 2016. Pinnacle also purchased the operations of The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Pennsylvania from GLPI for $138 million in September 2016. In December 2017, Pinnacle agreed to be acquired by Penn National Gaming for $2.8 billion in cash and stock. To ensure regulatory approval for the deal, Pinnacle would sell the operations of four properties to Boyd Gaming for $575 million prior to the merger: Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Casino, and Belterra Park. The real estate of Belterra Park was originally to be sold to GLPI, but was ultimately sold to Boyd for $58 million. The transactions were completed on October 15, 2018.

Beck, is a 21-question multiple-choice self-report inventory, one of the most widely used psychometric tests for measuring the severity of depression. Its development marked a shift among mental health professionals, who had until then, viewed depression from a psychodynamic perspective, instead of it being rooted in the patient's own thoughts. In its current version, the BDI-II is designed for individuals aged 13 and over, and is composed of items relating to symptoms of depression such as hopelessness and irritability, cognitions such as guilt or feelings of being punished, as well as physical symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and lack of interest in sex. There are three versions of the BDI‚Äîthe original BDI, first published in 1961 and later revised in 1978 as the BDI-1A, and the BDI-II, published in 1996. The BDI is widely used as an assessment tool by health care professionals and researchers in a variety of settings. The BDI was used as a model for the development of the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), first published in 1979 by clinical psychologist Maria Kovacs.Kovacs, M. (1992). Children's Depression Inventory. North Tonawanda, NY: Multi-Health Systems, Inc. Development and history According to Beck's publisher, 'When Beck began studying depression in the 1950s, the prevailing psychoanalytic theory attributed the syndrome to inverted hostility against the self.'McGraw Hill Publishing Company \\"Test developer profile: Aaron T. Beck\\". Retrieved on 2009-02-24 By contrast, the BDI was developed in a novel way for its time; by collating patients' verbatim descriptions of their symptoms and then using these to structure a scale which could reflect the intensity or severity of a given symptom. Beck drew attention to the importance of \\"negative cognitions\\" described as sustained, inaccurate, and often intrusive negative thoughts about the self. In his view, it was the case that these cognitions caused depression, rather than being generated by depression. Beck developed a triad of negative cognitions about the world, the future, and the self, which play a major role in depression. An example of the triad in action taken from Brown (1995) is the case of a student obtaining poor exam results: * The student has negative thoughts about the world, so he may come to believe he does not enjoy the class. * The student has negative thoughts about his future because he thinks he may not pass the class. * The student has negative thoughts about his self, as he may feel he does not deserve to be in college. The development of the BDI reflects that in its structure, with items such as \\"I have lost all of my interest in other people\\" to reflect the world, \\"I feel discouraged about the future\\" to reflect the future, and \\"I blame myself for everything bad that happens\\" to reflect the self. The view of depression as sustained by intrusive negative cognitions has had particular application in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which aims to challenge and neutralize them through techniques such as cognitive restructuring. BDI The original BDI, first published in 1961, consisted of twenty-one questions about how the subject has been feeling in the last week. Each question had a set of at least four possible responses, ranging in intensity. For example: * (0) I do not feel sad. * (1) I feel sad. * (2) I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it. * (3) I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it. When the test is scored, a value of 0 to 3 is assigned for each answer and then the total score is compared to a key to determine the depression's severity. The standard cut-off scores were as follows: *0‚Äì9: indicates minimal depression *10‚Äì18: indicates mild depression *19‚Äì29: indicates moderate depression *30‚Äì63: indicates severe depression. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. Some items on the original BDI had more than one statement marked with the same score. For instance, there are two responses under the Mood heading that score a 2: (2a) \\"I am blue or sad all the time and I can't snap out of it\\" and (2b) \\"I am so sad or unhappy that it is very painful\\". BDI-IA The BDI-IA was a revision of the original instrument developed by Beck during the 1970s, and copyrighted in 1978. To improve ease of use, the \\"a and b statements\\" described above were removed, and respondents were instructed to endorse how they had been feeling during the preceding two weeks. The internal consistency for the BDI-IA was good, with a Cronbach's alpha coefficient of around 0.85, meaning that the items on the inventory are highly correlated with each other. However, this version retained some flaws; the BDI-IA only addressed six out of the nine DSM-III criteria for depression. This and other criticisms were addressed in the BDI-II. BDI-II The BDI-II was a 1996 revision of the BDI, developed in response to the American Psychiatric Association's publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, which changed many of the diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. Items involving changes in body image, hypochondriasis, and difficulty working were replaced. Also, sleep loss and appetite loss items were revised to assess both increases and decreases in sleep and appetite. All but three of the items were reworded; only the items dealing with feelings of being punished, thoughts about suicide, and interest in sex remained the same. Finally, participants were asked to rate how they have been feeling for the past two weeks, as opposed to the past week as in the original BDI. Like the BDI, the BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original: * 0‚Äì13: minimal depression * 14‚Äì19: mild depression * 20‚Äì28: moderate depression * 29‚Äì63: severe depression.https://www.psychcongress.com/saundras-corner/scales- screenersdepression/beck-depression-inventory-ii-bdi-ii One measure of an instrument's usefulness is to see how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown to have a high one-week test‚Äìretest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting that it was not overly sensitive to daily variations in mood.Beck AT, Steer RA and Brown GK (1996) \\"Manual for the Beck Depression Inventory-II\\". San Antonio, TX: Psychological Corporation The test also has high internal consistency (Œ±=.91). Impact The development of the BDI was an important event in psychiatry and psychology; it represented a shift in health care professionals' view of depression from a Freudian, psychodynamic perspective, to one guided by the patient's own thoughts or \\"cognitions\\". It also established the principle that instead of attempting to develop a psychometric tool based on a possibly invalid theory, self-report questionnaires when analysed using techniques such as factor analysis can suggest theoretical constructs. The BDI was originally developed to provide a quantitative assessment of the intensity of depression. Because it is designed to reflect the depth of depression, it can monitor changes over time and provide an objective measure for judging improvement and the effectiveness or otherwise of treatment methods. The instrument remains widely used in research; in 1998, it had been used in over 2000 empirical studies. It has been translated into multiple European languages as well as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Persian, and Xhosa. Limitations The BDI suffers from the same problems as other self-report inventories, in that scores can be easily exaggerated or minimized by the person completing them. Like all questionnaires, the way the instrument is administered can have an effect on the final score. If a patient is asked to fill out the form in front of other people in a clinical environment, for instance, social expectations have been shown to elicit a different response compared to administration via a postal survey. In participants with concomitant physical illness the BDI's reliance on physical symptoms such as fatigue may artificially inflate scores due to symptoms of the illness, rather than of depression. In an effort to deal with this concern Beck and his colleagues developed the \\"Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care\\" (BDI-PC), a short screening scale consisting of seven items from the BDI-II considered to be independent of physical function. Unlike the standard BDI, the BDI-PC produces only a binary outcome of \\"not depressed\\" or \\"depressed\\" for patients above a cutoff score of 4. Although designed as a screening device rather than a diagnostic tool, the BDI is sometimes used by health care providers to reach a quick diagnosis. The BDI is copyrighted; a fee must be paid for each copy used. There is no evidence that the BDI-II is more valid or reliable than other depression scales,Zimmerman M. Using scales to monitor symptoms and treatment of depression (measurement based care). In UpToDate, Rose, BD (Ed), UpToDate, Waltham, MA, 2011. and public domain scales such as the Patient Health Questionnaire ‚Äì Nine Item (PHQ-9) have been studied as a useful tool.

The arena is named for philanthropists John Petersen and his wife Gertrude, who donated $10 million for its construction. John Petersen, a Pitt alumnus, is a native of nearby Erie and is the retired President and CEO of Erie Insurance Group. The Petersen Events Center was winner of the 2003 Innovative Architecture & Design Honor Award from Recreation Management magazine. History The arena opened in 2002 on part of the former site of Pitt Stadium, which housed the university's football team from 1925 to 1999. The Pitt men's and women's basketball programs make their home here, previously residing in Fitzgerald Field House. The new building, due to its larger capacity, also meant that Pitt no longer had to play certain games or hold graduation ceremonies at the Civic Arena. Panther statues and the former site of Pitt Stadium. Its first event was a Counting Crows concert. For concerts the Center seats 9,000 for end-stage shows, 14,763 for center-stage shows. The first official women's basketball game at the Pete was a 90-51 win over Robert Morris University on November 22, 2002. The first official men's basketball game at the Pete was an 82-67 win over Duquesne University on November 23, 2002. Since its creation through the end of the 2012-13 season, the Pitt men's basketball team has compiled a record of 180‚Äì22 (.891) at the Pete, including a 9-1 record against teams ranked in the top five. Pitt broke the 100 win mark on November 22, 2008 with an 86-60 win over Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and the 200 win mark on December 30, 2014 vs Florida Gulf Coast. In 2006, the Pittsburgh Xplosion, a professional basketball team in the Continental Basketball Association, played its first game at the arena. The team folded just prior to the start of the 2008-09 season. In October 2011, a new high definition video board was installed in the Petersen Events Center. Since 2010, the Petersen Events Center has been used as the primary alternative to the much larger PPG Paints Arena, which replaced Mellon Arena, and is now the Pittsburgh home of Disney on Ice, Marvel Universe Live! and the Big3, and hosted the Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey Circus in its final years. Amenities With 430,000 total square feet, the Pete seats 12,508 for basketball and 9,000 for end stage concerts. The arena features of lobby space with high ceilings and of glass with a barely visible coating that allows sunlight through while controlling heat loss and gain. A video score board that had previous hung in Pitt Stadium was also installed in the lobby. The arena also features 18 luxury suites, including five courtside luxury suites (the only college arena with courtside suites) and a 193-seat SuperSuite. Student section and accolades UConn in 2009. A portion of the Oakland Zoo can be seen at the bottom. Pitt won the nationally televised game 70‚Äì60. The section known as the Oakland Zoo is composed of the sections across from the team benches and next to the court. The name comes from Oakland, the neighborhood where Pitt's campus resides. The students in the Zoo wear gold T-shirts with the words \\"Oakland Zoo\\" in some way, shape or form across the front. This layout and unity is a large factor in why the Pete is such a tough place to play for opposing teams. In fact, Pitt has lost only five home non-conference games out of over 120 since the Panthers moved into the Pete in 2002. In 2006, Sports Illustrated surveyed the Big East Conference's basketball players, and the Pete was named the \\"Toughest Place to Play,\\" with specific players mentioning the Oakland Zoo and the fans' creativity. In 2013, the facility was also ranked as having the second best game time environment in the nation by USA Today. The Petersen Events Center also has received accolades for being the sixth loudest college basketball venue according to ESPN the Magazine, the eighth best overall college basketball venue according to ESPN's Jason King, and among the toughest places for opponents to play in college basketball according to multiple Bleacher Report articles. The Pitt men's basketball team has also sold out of season tickets since the venue opened. In 2007 and 2010, \\"The Pete\\" hosted first and second-round games of the NCAA Women's Division I Tournament. Other uses An inside view of the arena in November, 2019 The Petersen Events Center serves as more than just the home court of the Panthers basketball teams. Located within the facility is a Baierl Student Recreation Center featuring four racquetball courts, two squash courts, Cybex weight machines, a free weight area, aerobics practice room, martial arts room, health assessment area, and aerobic area with treadmills, exercise bikes, elliptical and Stairmaster machines and four plasma TVs. In addition, the McCarl Panthers Hall of Champions, which pays homage to and displays memorabilia from past Pitt athletics achievements, and the official Pittsburgh Panthers Team Store are located in the main lobby of the Pete. Also included is the Willis Center for Academics for student athletes which includes computer and writing labs, a math and science area, individual tutor rooms, and a career resource area. Also, a food court is located within the Pete and is available to students and others during the weekdays in addition to when events are being hosted within the arena. The arena also features and auxiliary practice basketball facility, athletic training, office and media facilities. The Pete also hosts the University's commencement ceremony.

The story is told through text and photographs. It was first published by Doubleday in 1957, went out of print for years, was reissued by Houghton Mifflin in 1998, and brought out by Barnes & Noble in a narrated version for their Nook eReader in 2012. Wright wrote 10 books starring Edith and the bears. The nine that have been reprinted are The Lonely Doll, Edith and Mr. Bear, A Gift from the Lonely Doll, Holiday for Edith and the Bears, The Doll and the Kitten, Edith and the Duckling, Edith and Little Bear Lend a Hand, Edith and Midnight and The Lonely Doll Learns a Lesson. Plot The Lonely Doll tells the story of a doll named Edith, who lives by herself until two teddy bears, called Mr. Bear and Little Bear, appear in her life. One day, Mr. Bear goes out for a walk leaving the two alone in the house; He returns to find they have rummaged in a closet for dress-up clothing, smeared themselves with makeup, and written \\"Mr. Bear is just a silly old thing\\" in lipstick on the mirror. Mr. Bear proceeds to discipline both Little Bear and Edith, leaving Edith to worry that he will take Little Bear and leave. Mr. Bear assures her that he will never, ever, leave her.  Characters  Edith, the main character of many of her books, looks a great deal like Dare Wright herself, with a blonde pony tail and golden hoop earrings. Edith was named after Dare's mother, Edith Stevenson Wright, a portrait artist.  Controversy  When Houghton Mifflin reissued The Lonely Doll in 1998, it was not without a minor battle from colleagues, according to then children's book publisher Anita Silvey. At the core of the controversy was the scene in which Mr. Bear spanks Edith for misbehaving. As a result, some parents objected to the book. Other parents, such as critic and novelist Daphne Merkin and fashion designer Vera Wang, supported the book.Coleman, David. The Unsettling Stories of Two Lonely Dolls. The New York Times, October 17, 2004 Toys The doll is a felt Lenci Doll from the 1920s which belonged to Dare as a child. She sewed Edith's outfits for the books and changed her eye color to blue, resembling the author's looks. Mr. Bear was manufactured by Schuco, and Little Bear was a special edition Steiff, \\"Jackie Bear.\\" Both were purchased in the 1950s with the help of Dare's brother, Blaine Wright. The Rothschild Doll Company, founded by Mimi Rothschild and Howard Mandel, obtained a license directly from Dare Wright in 1985 to reproduce both a hard plastic and felt version of Edith The Lonely Doll. The Rothschild Doll Company manufactured a 22\\" felt Edith doll as originally produced by the Lenci company. She had human hair, painted face, a cotton pink checked dress and black suede shoes. Rothschild made an exclusive basket set containing the 22\\" felt doll, a Mohair joined teddy bear known as Mr. Bear and a 12\\" Mohair jointed Little Bear. A new felt finished rendition of the Edith doll was manufactured in 2005 by the Alexander Doll Company, who made the first Edith doll in 1958. It was sold exclusively by The Toy Shoppe. In 2007, R. John Wright produced a limited edition felt Edith doll for collectors to celebrate the 50th anniversary of The Lonely Doll. Reception The book was first published in 1957, and made the New York Times children's books best seller list. In November 2010, The British newspaper The Guardian named The Lonely Doll one of the 10 Best Illustrated Children's Books of all time.

Between 1990 and 1995 he was an advisor to the government of Bob Rae. Background Reville was born in Brantford, Ontario. After graduating from Brantford Collegiate Institute in 1961, he attended Trinity College at the University of Toronto and proceeded to law school. It was expected that he would follow the career path of his father, an Ontario judge. Instead, Reville became manic-depressive and attempted to kill himself during his law studies. He was institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital and became a crusader for mental health reform upon his release. During an interview with Canadian Press, Reville intoned, tongue firmly in cheek, \\"I became a New Democrat because I was mentally ill\\" and was bemused when his statement appeared as a headline in newspapers across the country. He was making the point that he had begun to learn something about powerlessness in hospital, and joined the NDP to fight for marginalized people. He once joked that he was the only MPP with a certificate to prove that he was sane. Politics Reville served on Toronto's city council from 1980 to 1985, and emerged as a popular alderman in the downtown area. Known primarily for his work on affordable housing, he was responsible for an environmental first. He got Council to award intervenor funding for a community group to be involved in the environmental assessment of a proposed refuse-fired steam plant. Out of the group that organized around the issue came two popular politicians, Marilyn Churley and Peter Tabuns, both of whom were City Councillors before being elected to the Legislature. David was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1985 provincial election, winning an easy victory in Riverdale. He was re-elected in the 1987 election, defeating future Liberal Member of Parliament and then City Councillor Jim Karygiannis by about 1,500 votes. Reville was an opposition MPP throughout his time in the legislature. He was proud to be the author of a private member's bill that brought roomers and boarders under the protection of the Landlord and Tenant Act for the first time. (Bill 10) Electoral record=Later life Reville did not seek re-election in 1990, arguing that he wanted to devote his time to more useful pursuits. After the NDP won a majority government in the 1990 provincial election, he served as a senior advisor to Premier Bob Rae. In 1994, Reville was appointed chair of the Ontario Advocacy Commission but it was disbanded by the Mike Harris government less than two years later. In 2001, he received an award from the Council of Canadians with Disabilities. He ran a consulting company called David Reville & Associates specializing in social research and community development. As a consultant to the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, he helped develop the augmented education program at George Brown College; the award-winning program helps people with mental health and addictions histories get their first jobs in the construction and culinary industries. In 2004, Reville began teaching for the School of Disability Studies at Ryerson University; one of his courses was called A History of Madness and the other Mad Peoples' History which received the Canadian Association for University Continuing Education Award of Excellence in 2011. He retired in 2014. That year, friends and colleagues honoured Reville by establishing the David Reville/Working for Change course bursary in Mad People's History; the winner is selected annually from the Working for Change community. Working for Change creates education and employment opportunities for people with mental health and addictions challenges. Reville was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Queen's University in 2015. Singing has been a big part of his life. He was a member, man and boy, of the choir at Grace Anglican Church in Brantford for 10 years. He sang at the Mariposa Folk Festival with the Spadina Road Tabernacle Band in 1980 and at Carnegie Hall with newchoir, Toronto's first rock choir in 2015. He was a member of the Eastminster United Church choir in Toronto (2014-2019).

Womanist theology associates with and departs from Feminist theology and Black theology specifically because it integrates the perspectives and experiences of African American and other women of color. The former's lack of attention to the everyday realities of women of color and the latter's lack of understanding of the full dimension of liberation from the unique oppressions of black women require bringing them together in Womanist Theology. The goals of womanist theology include interrogating the social construction of black womanhood in relation to the black community and to assume a liberatory perspective so African American women can live emboldened lives within the African American community and within the larger society. Some of its tasks are excavating the life stories of poor women of African descent in the church and to understanding the \\"languages\\" of black women. Etymology The term womanish was commonly used in Black daily language by mothers to describe adolescent daughters who act outrageous and grown-up, in contrast to girlish. Womanist was then developed in 1983 by black writer and activist Alice Walker in her collection of essays, In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose. In this text, she makes the point that \\"A Womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender.\\" Hence, while womanist referred primarily to African- American women, it was also for women in general. Walker's works would have significant impact on later womanist theologians. Development The roots of modern womanist theology grew out of the theology of James Hal Cone, Katie G. Cannon, Jacquelyn Grant, and Delores Williams. Cone developed black theology which sought to make sense out of theology from black experience in America. In his book A Black Theology of Liberation, Cone argued that \\"God is black\\" in an effort to demonstrate that God identifies with oppressed black Americans. Grant, a first-generation womanist theologian, argued that Cone did not attend to the fullness of black experience ‚Äì specifically that of black women. She argued that the oppression of black women is different from that of black men. Grant pointed out that lower-class black women must navigate between the threefold oppression of racism, sexism, and classism in her books Womanist Theology and White Women's Christ and Black Women's Jesus: Feminist Christology and Womanist Response. For her, Jesus is a \\"divine co-sufferer\\" who suffered in his time like black women today. Grant concludes that black women are more oppressed and in need of further liberation than black men and especially white women. Delores Williams took the work of theologians such as Cone and Grant and expanded upon them. She suggested that womanist theologians need to \\"search for the voices, actions, opinions, experience, and faith\\" of black women in order to experience the God who \\"makes a way out of no way.\\" She defines womanist in the following way: Approaches to the Bible Womanist theologians use a variety of methods to approach the scripture. Some attempt to find black women within the biblical narrative so as to reclaim the role and identity of black people in general, and black women specifically, within the Bible. Examples include the social ethicist Cheryl Sanders and the womanist theologian Karen Baker-Fletcher. Some approach the Bible \\"objectively\\" to critically evaluate text that degrades women and people of color and to offer an African-centered form, to resist male domination and bias, or what could be termed anti-women or androcentric attitudes and forms. Others draw on resources outside the Bible to enhance the plurality and cohesion of the texts along with our life experiences and reject scripture as a whole or part which is seen to serve male interest only. These methods are not separated and can be endorsed together. Patricia-Anne Johnson writes that \\"Renita J. Weems, a womanist professor and scholar of the Hebrew Bible, examines scripture as a world filled with women of color. Through the use of womanist imagination, Weems helps students to understand female roles, personalities, and woman-to-woman relationships during the time when the biblical texts were written.\\" Johnson, quoting further from Weems, also shows how Hagar and Esther can be seen as models of resistance for black women: \\"Womanism may be envisioned as a post-colonial discourse that allows African- American women to embrace a Jesus and a God free of the imperialism of white supremacy.\\" See also * Asian feminist theology * Stacey M.

Esposito is considered by some to be the father of modern pizza.Arthur Schwartz, Naples at Table: Cooking in Campania (1998), p. 68. .John Dickie, Delizia!: The Epic History of the Italians and Their Food (2008), p. 186. In 1889, pizza had not yet become a popular or well-known dish and was typically eaten by poor people as a way to use up various ingredients that would otherwise go to waste.Paul Hofmann, That Fine Italian Hand (1991), p. 32. At that time, Esposito was considered the premier pizza-maker in the city of Naples.Father Giuseppe Orsini, Joseph E. Orsini, Italian Baking Secrets (2007), p. 99. Esposito was, therefore, requested to prepare a pizza for Queen Margherita of Savoy, who had traveled to Naples with King Umberto I. Esposito and his wife were admitted to the royal kitchens to prepare this dish as he saw fit. Deeming the traditional garlic topping to be unfit for the royal palate, Esposito instead prepared three different pizzas, the last of which used a combination of tomatoes, mozzarella cheese and basil to emulate the red, white, and green of the Italian flag. It is claimed by some sources that this was the first time pizza was made with mozzarella cheese.James McNair, Pizza (1987), p. 5. Queen Margherita, having never had pizza before, so enjoyed the dish that she had her head of table services send Esposito a letter to commend his pizzas, stating that they \\"were found to be delicious\\". Esposito used this recommendation to successfully promote his restaurant, naming the pizza most enjoyed by the Queen, \\"Pizza Margherita\\".Linda Stradley, \\"History and Legends of Pizza\\" (2004). The legend of pizza Margherita is considered a false history, as a pizza made with the same toppings was already present in Naples between 1796 and 1810. It is widely reported that this event caused pizza to become a fad, from which it retained enduring popularity. Because of Esposito's experiments with ingredients and presentation, and his successful preparation of the dish for Queen Margherita, it is suggested by some that Esposito was the father of the modern pizza. Esposito's restaurant still exists, although the name has been changed to Pizzeria Brandi, and the royal letter favoring Esposito's pizza is on display in the restaurant.

He served the longest term ever as a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council. Biography=Early life Vernon Hamersley was born in Guildford, Western Australia. The son of Samuel Hamersley, he was a member of the prominent and well-connected Hamersley family. His grandfather was Edward Hamersley (Snr); among his uncles was Edward Hamersley (Jnr) and Maitland Brown; and he was related by blood or marriage to many prominent Western Australians including John Forrest and William Locke Brockman. He was educated at Guildford Grammar School, before continuing his studies in England at the Magdalen College School at Oxford, and the Downton Agricultural College at Salisbury. Career He returned to Western Australia in 1889, spending some time on the Eastern goldfields, before farming with his father at York until 1895. On the death of his grandfather in 1874, he inherited the station Hasely in Toodyay, which he developed as a farm and stud. He also became a part owner of Mount Barnett cattle station in the Kimberley. In 1895, he married Clara Hicks. He first became active in public life in 1899, becoming a member of the Toodyay Road Board. He would later become its chairman before retiring his membership in 1906. In 1900 he became a Justice of the Peace, and the following year he unsuccessfully contested the Legislative Assembly seat of Toodyay as an independent. On 5 August 1904, he won the Legislative Council seat of East Province in a by-election following the death of Edward Keane. He would be returned to the seat in the next six elections, holding the seat until his death. He joined the Liberal Party in 1911. He won the May 1916 election by a single vote. Upon a recount, both Hamersley and his opponent, Michael McCabe of the Country Party, had attained 1,651 votes each, and Hamersley was elected on the casting vote of the Returning Officer. McCabe then petitioned the Court of Disputed Returns against Hamersley's election, with the result that the election was declared null and void. Hamersley appealed to the full court, but the appeal was dismissed. A by-election was subsequently held on 2 September 1916, with Hamersley winning re-election on a significantly higher turnout. After 1920, he held his seat for the Country Party, and from April 1921 he was Father of the House. Plaque honouring Vernon Hamersley in Toodyay Death He died in West Perth on 24 October 1946. His term of 42 years, 2 months and 19 days remains the longest ever term as a member of the Western Australian Legislative Council.

Development The Boeing Pelican ULTRA is intended as a large-capacity transport craft initially for military use, with possible subsequent availability as a commercial freighter serving the world's largest cargo centers. It is significantly larger and more capable than the biggest existing commercial airliners, commercial freighters, and military airlifters. The Pelican is not targeted for civilian transportation, but it can be converted to a commercial airliner transporting up to 3,000 passengers. Internal deliberation The design process for what became the Pelican began in early 2000, when designers in the Phantom Works division of Boeing started working on solutions for the United States armed forces objective of moving thousands of troops, weapons, military equipment, and provisions to a war or battle scene faster, such as successfully deploying an Army brigade of 3,000 troops and of equipment within instead of the it required in the past. In particular, the Department of Defense had requested a vehicle of any mode (land, air, or sea) with the ability to move of cargo. Knowing that the United States Army was investigating large airships and airship-airplane hybrids, Boeing Phantom Works internally considered and rejected at least three known design iterations: a large blimp or dirigible airship, a smaller but wider airship that creates dynamic lift while in forward motion, and then back to a larger airship that flies at low altitude with wings spanning . It also looked at and discarded a fast oceangoing ship and a sea-based ground effect vehicle. A plan view of a ground effect concept airplane. Many features of this concept were incorporated into the Boeing Pelican ULTRA. Boeing Phantom Works then selected a land-based ground effect vehicle with high drooping wings as its solution. It applied for a patent in October 2001 on a ground effect airplane that would form the basis for the Pelican, aside from some eventually omitted design elements such as a T-tail, upward-pointing (positive dihedral) winglets, an additional middle row of landing gears, and a loading ramp at the back of the fuselage. The patent also listed open-ended fuselage compartment dimensions of at least high, wide, and long, with an aircraft wingspan of at least . Its example fuselage length and wingspan of and would come close to the final Pelican configuration, though. Initial artist drawings of the aircraft were made public in early 2002. In May 2002, Boeing applied for a patent on variable-sweep, downward-pointing (negative dihedral, or anhedral) winglets to help ground effect vehicles avoid water contact while minimizing aerodynamic drag; the patent drawings show a cylindrical fuselage, which may indicate that a pressurized aircraft was considered at the time, although the final Pelican design has an unpressurized fuselage. The next month, without explicitly naming Boeing as the aircraft originator, the Army cited the Pelican as an emerging technology to improve strategic responsiveness in its 2002 Transformation Roadmap. In July, a U.S. Transportation Command team lead at Scott Air Force Base mentioned the Pelican as a practical solution for moving troops and equipment over long distances. Meanwhile, the designers evaluated three different aircraft sizes with mean takeoff weights of and wingspans of , respectively. Public introduction The Pelican was formally introduced to the public at the 2002 Farnborough International Airshow in July, but with few specifics. As described in its physical form, the aircraft mostly resembled future versions of the Pelican, except that the winglets were reverted to upward-pointing to maximize lift. Boeing announced that the Pelican could fly up to in altitude and that the wingspan was limited by a so that it could be used on existing runways and taxiways. Both parameters were drastically smaller than the Pelican's eventual final specifications, however, and although Boeing's original patent called for a folding wing, news reports did not mention a folding mechanism, so it was unclear whether the stated wingspan represented an unfoldable, unfolded, or folded width. On the other hand, Boeing mentioned a theoretical Pelican payload of up to , which was much larger than the final specified maximum payload and was actually about equal to the final maximum takeoff weight. While Boeing said that the U.S. Army was evaluating the Pelican in war games as a solution to \\"beat ships across the ocean,\\" and that the company was jointly studying the aircraft with the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), it noted that full concept studies would not begin for another 5‚Äì8 years, and the aircraft would have to wait for at least 20 years before entering service. In the September 2002 edition of its company news magazine, Boeing published an article highlighting the Pelican and revealing more of its final specifications, including a , a wing area of over , a payload of of cargo, an increased flight service ceiling of or more in altitude, and a range for a smaller payload of , depending on the flight mode. In addition, it stated that the Pelican could move 17 M-1 Abrams tanks, and that the aircraft would be offered along with the C-17 Globemaster III transport, the CH-47 Chinook helicopter, and the Advanced Theater Transport as part of the company's mobility solution for the U.S. armed forces. This article attracted international media coverage, and as Boeing Phantom Works continued to mature the design (including selection of the mid-size vehicle option), additional details about the aircraft began to appear over the next year in newspaper, general science magazine, and aviation industry print publications and research conferences. In November 2002, Boeing also applied for a patent on an automated system for controlling large, multiple-wheel steering aircraft (such as the Pelican) during ground maneuvers, crosswind landings, and crosswind takeoffs. According to Boeing, the Pelican aircraft technology was starting to gain followers among the decision makers evaluating the mobility initiatives within the Army and the Air Force, and the Navy also showed interest though it was directing its attention more toward hybrid ultra-large airships (HULAs). The market could support over 1,000 of this type of aircraft by 2020, Boeing asserted, if the military used this aircraft and if air transport's share of the transoceanic cargo shipping market increased to two percent from one percent (versus the current 99 percent for ocean shipping transport). Taking some market share from ocean shipping could occur, contended Boeing, because in comparison with traditional air cargo transports, the Pelican is less expensive and offers much more payload volume and weight. Boeing stated that the Pelican's continued development could depend on a positive result in the U.S. Army's Advanced Mobility Concepts Study (AMCS), which would describe the future mobility concepts and capabilities needed by the armed forces in years 2015 to 2020. By the latter half of 2003, Boeing Phantom Works was showcasing the Pelican on its web site and in technology expositions. The U.S. Army published the AMCS report in December 2003, but the Pelican was not among the list of the eight most promising future mobility platforms for evaluation. Despite this setback, Boeing in 2004 continued low-key educational and evangelical promotion of the aircraft. At the 2004 Farnborough Air Show, Boeing announced that the Pelican had entered wind tunnel testing and that the aircraft's service ceiling was increased to . Project stoppage In a 2005 United States congressional report evaluating 11 proposed airlift and sealift platforms for military mobility, the Boeing Pelican was assessed as marginally feasible to enter service in 2016, ranking behind six platforms that were deemed feasible. The lower grade was due to the tremendous investment required to develop an operational product because of the scale of the aircraft and the use of high-risk technologies, which might prevent the aircraft from achieving technology readiness level (TRL) 5. With this assessment, the report essentially reaffirmed Boeing's previous concerns about its ability to produce the aircraft for service by a 2015 timeframe. At the cargo loading dock with wings folded up. Altitude measurement sensors attached throughout the underside of the aircraft. Though Boeing filed a couple of patent applications in mid-2005 relating to cargo container handling and automatic altitude measurement, no other public announcements appear to have been made about the aircraft after the report was issued. By April 2006, a report on Boeing internal documents showed that its long-term aircraft focus was primarily about low-cost and environmentally efficient passenger planes of conventional size, and there was no mention of the Boeing Pelican. Facing diminished odds of a large order from the U.S. armed forces, which collectively represented the aircraft's sole indispensable launch customer, Boeing quietly discontinued further development of the Pelican program. Description Like the pelican water bird for which it is named, the concept aircraft can both skim over water and soar to heights above mountain peaks. However, the Pelican is not designed for contact with bodies of water, so although the aircraft cannot take off or land at sea, it can be designed to be lighter and more aerodynamic. The aircraft is a land-based ground effect vehicle that operates from conventional runways despite having an enormous maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) of . During flight, the Pelican exits ground effect to climb a few thousand feet while the surface below the aircraft changes from ocean to solid ground, then enters descent to arrive at an airport like other airplanes. This capability differentiates the aircraft from some previously built ground effect vehicles such as the Caspian Sea Monster, whose relatively narrow could not produce enough lift to fly the large vehicle out of ground effect. Flight characteristics In its most efficient flight mode, the Pelican flies in ground effect at above the water, measured from the fixed structure (the underside of the fuselage), though the aircraft distance can be reduced to depending on its wingtip positioning. It has a cruise speed of , which lets it skim above 90 percent of the ocean about 90 percent of the time before high waves force it to fly out of ground effect. Boeing's ocean wave studies during 2000 revealed that north‚Äìsouth aircraft routes and many east‚Äìwest routes worked very well in ground effect, with flights at latitude between 30 degrees north and 30 degrees south being very efficient, while polar routes were more challenging. The aircraft can also cruise over land at with an altitude of . At higher flight levels, the aircraft can attain nearly jet-like speeds in thinner air but consumes fuel faster than in ground effect mode, though the aircraft still performs at a fuel efficiency similar to a Boeing 747-400F aircraft freighter. The Pelican can fly to a height of , so it can clear all of the world's highest mountain ranges except for the Himalayas. The aircraft takes off and lands at airfields differently from conventional airliners because of the Pelican's unusual landing gear configuration. A typical aircraft pitches its nose up right before final liftoff or touchdown, but the Pelican appears to have little or no rotation. Like the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress strategic bomber, the Pelican seems to levitate on or off the ground. Fuselage A double-deck structure with a rectangular cross- section, the fuselage is long and is unpressurized except within the cockpit. It is capped in front by a large swing-nose door, which allows for loading and unloading cargo through both decks, and in back by conventional tailfin and tailplane stabilizers attached directly to the fuselage, instead of the heavier T-tail empennage that is typically used by other ground effect planes. The main deck has a cabin area that is wide and long. For military purposes, the upper deck is designed to carry troops or cargo containers, while the main deck has a height of so that it can hold oversized vehicles such as tanks or helicopters. Wings A cross-sectional view of the undrooped part of the wing, showing a container stored within the cavity. A cross-sectional view of the fuselage-wing join. Note how the upper deck aligns with the wing cavity. The aircraft's wings are mounted to the fuselage in a high wing configuration, and they are unswept and mostly parallel to the ground in their inner sections. The wings droop downward in their outer sections to enhance ground effect, also having a slight backward sweep in the leading edge and forward sweep in the trailing edge. To let the aircraft change shape for different types of operations, the wings are hinged within the drooping sections, and the axis of rotation is parallel to the fuselage. The wings fold slightly for takeoffs and landings, and they fold about 90 degrees to reduce clearance amounts during taxiing and ground operations. At the ends of the folding wing sections, wingtips droop below the rest of the aircraft by up to when the larger folding wing and the wingtip are in their normal positions. To avoid ground or water contact, the wingtips are hinged for active rotation, as the rotational axis is perpendicular to the direction of flight but not necessarily parallel to the ground. If a wingtip accidentally touches the ground or water, it minimizes the contact by passively swiveling upward and backward, with the clock position moving from six o'clock to three o'clock or nine o'clock, depending on which side of the wing is viewed. The wings have an area of more than and a mean aerodynamic chord of . The wingspan is , although the wingspan can be reduced to as small as when the wing is folded. There are no leading edge devices or anti-icing systems, but the trailing edge has flaps that span the entire wing. The wings are designed with a large thickness-to- chord ratio to reduce aircraft weight and to hold part of the overall payload, a feature that is unique in modern aircraft and only rarely had been implemented in previous-era aircraft, such as in the Junkers G.38. Power plant Alternate engine propulsion arrangements. Each set of contra-rotating propellers is attached to two engines. The Pelican is powered by eight turboprop engines, which produce an output of each. The engines are about five times more powerful than the engines on turboprop or propfan-powered military transport aircraft such as the Airbus A400M (using Europrop TP400 engines) and the Antonov An-22 (Kuznetsov NK-12MA) and An-70 (Progress D-27). The new engines would probably be a hybrid derived from two General Electric (GE) engines: the LM6000 marine engine, an aeroderivative gas turbine based on the CF6-80C2 turbofan (used on the Boeing 767 and other widebody aircraft) that powers fast ferries, cargo ships, and stationary electrical generation plants, combined with a core based on the GE90 turbofan, which powers the Boeing 777 twin-engine widebody aircraft. The Pelican's many engines mitigate a single- engine loss scenario, so just as the Boeing 777-300ER can lift its maximum takeoff weight with just one of its two engines working, seven operational engines out of the eight total can provide enough power for the 7.7-times greater MTOW of the Pelican. The power plant converts about 38 percent of the fuel's energy into thrust, a comparable engine efficiency to those in modern widebody aircraft. The engines are paired behind four sets of coaxial contra- rotating propellers that are positioned at the leading edge of the inner sections of the wings. A set of contra-rotating propellers has eight blades (four blades on the front propeller and four blades on the back propeller) that are in diameter, which dwarfs the GE90 turbofan, is at least about two and a half times the size of the propellers on the aforementioned turboprop and propfan engines, and is noticeably bigger than the largest marine ship propellers, although it is less than half as wide as the main rotors on the largest helicopters. While a single engine drives each set of contra-rotating propellers on some common propfan aircraft such as the An-22 and the Tupolev Tu-95 (respectively the heaviest and fastest turboprop-powered aircraft in the world), the Pelican requires the two propellers within a contra-rotating propeller set to be matched with twin engines. This arrangement is due to the amount of power needed to lift the large aircraft off the ground and to ascend to and cruise at high altitude, but one of the engines in each engine pairing can be turned off while cruising in ground effect, as the paired engines are connected by a geared combiner gearbox so that one or both of the engines can turn the propellers. Payload The Pelican has a maximum payload weight of , which allows an army to transport 70 heavy expanded mobility tactical trucks (HEMTTs) or 52 M270 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRSs). It can carry 17 M-1 Abrams tanks in five rows of three abreast and one row of two abreast. The Pelican can also move ten CH-47D Chinook helicopters, which only use about ten percent of the payload weight capacity and are confined to the main deck due to their vehicle size. While human transportation would typically be in the form of military troops, the aircraft can be used to transport 3,000 passengers as a commercial airliner, though the aircraft is able to ferry the equivalent of 8,000 passengers (including carry-on items, luggage, seats, stowage bins, and other cabin furnishings) if factors other than payload weight are ignored (such as cabin area). Loading and unloading container cargo. As a cargo freighter, the Pelican is designed to handle the standard intermodal shipping containers used in shipping, rail, and trucking instead of the smaller unit load devices (containers and pallets) that dominate the air cargo industry. The aircraft is designed to handle two layers of containers on its main deck. The containers are arranged longitudinally within the fuselage in eight rows of five containers, followed by two rows of three containers, for a total of 46 containers in a layer. The upper deck only holds one container layer, but it allows access to the cargo area of the wings, each of which can hold 20 containers aligned parallel to the fuselage in two rows of ten abreast. Within a cumulative cargo area of , the entire aircraft can transport 178 containers, or the equivalent of a single-stacked, containerized freight train stretching over long. At the maximum payload weight, a Pelican aircraft holding the maximum number of containers will have an average gross weight of per container. Range At the maximum payload, the aircraft can travel in ground effect, which is about the distance between New York City and London. Carrying a smaller payload of , or slightly over half of the maximum payload, it can travel in ground effect, roughly the distance between Hong Kong and Buenos Aires, taking about in travel time. This distance is greater than the world's longest airline flights, and it is just short of the between two antipodes, which theoretically represents nonstop range to anywhere on earth (ignoring geopolitical barriers, headwinds, and other factors). The aircraft can alternatively carry that payload at high altitude with a decreased range of about , or approximately the distance between New York City and Shanghai. Ground accommodation A side view of the fuselage, showing a row of 19 landing gears distributed along the fuselage. The fuselage has a landing gear row underneath its left and right sides. Unlike the typical tricycle undercarriage of most airliners, the undercarriage arrangement for the Pelican distributes the aircraft's weight on ground over two rows of 19 inline landing gears, which are mounted on each side directly under the length of the fuselage. Each landing gear row contains dual-wheel retractable landing gears distributed over about in length, with an average center-to-center distance of between each inline landing gear. As the landing gear rows are spaced about apart from each other, the Pelican's wheel span may meet the code letter F standard of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Aerodrome Reference Code, which is used for airport planning purposes. While only the nose landing gear can be steered on most airliners, each landing gear on the Pelican is steerable, so the aircraft can more easily perform crosswind landings and complete turns at a smaller radius when it is on the ground. The combined 76 aircraft tires on the Pelican far exceeds the 32 wheels of the current largest cargo aircraft, the Antonov An-225. The average load per wheel is , or meaningfully larger than the typical maximum design load of for large, long-range aircraft. Pavement loading from the Pelican may be comparatively low, though. Boeing claims that the aircraft's ground flotation characteristic, a measure tied to the ground's ability to keep a vehicle from sinking, at maximum takeoff weight is superior to that of the much-smaller McDonnell-Douglas DC-10, which imposes the most demanding flotation requirements among aircraft of its era. However, according to the designer of the Aerocon Dash 1.6 wingship (a larger, sea-based ground effect vehicle that was investigated by DARPA a few years before the Pelican was proposed), regular Pelican operation at airports with high water tables underground may result in a type of seismic wave that leads to cracks in airport terminal buildings and eventually causes greater damage within months. A landing gear, which is steerable and holds two wheels. A conventional takeoff and landing (CTOL) aircraft, the Pelican requires a takeoff runway length of at MTOW, which is shorter than the listed distance required for the much-lighter Boeing 747-400F. For Pelican landings, a satisfactory airfield meets the desired runway length and width of , respectively, and has a load classification number (LCN) of at least 30 if paved or 23 if unpaved. The aircraft may also be able to use a marginal airfield, which has a minimum runway length of , width of , and an LCN (if known) of 30 paved or 23 unpaved. A runway with an LCN of 30 can thus withstand the Pelican at lower weights, but it should not host some versions of the Boeing 737 narrowbody aircraft (including the popular 737-800) nor most versions of the 777, regardless of whether the runway is long and wide enough to handle those other planes. Boeing maintains that many military airfields are able to host aircraft that have the Pelican's large wingspan, adding that in the conflict regions of Southwest Asia from the Fertile Crescent and the Arabian peninsula eastward to Pakistan, at least 323 airfields meet the satisfactory landing criteria, with additional airfields that can meet the marginal criteria or be restored to satisfactory or marginal. The aircraft's length and wingspan, however, make the Pelican too big for the \\"80-meter box,\\" the informal name of the maximum size specified in the ICAO Aerodrome Reference Code. The Pelican requires at the least a ramp or elevator to load and unload cargo. A more ideal setup is to build dedicated ground infrastructure at airports for transloading, such as cranes, railcars, and apron jacks, which approaches the sophistication of container terminal facilities used at the docks of major marine ports.

He pioneered an ecology-based architecture (since 1971), working on the theory and practice of sustainable design. The Guardian newspaper (2008) named him \\"one of the 50 people who could save the planet\\".[ 1] Yeang's headquarters is in Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) as Hamzah & Yeang, with offices in London (UK) as Llewelyn Davies Ken Yeang Ltd. and Beijing (China) as North Hamzah Yeang Architectural and Engineering Company. Biography=Formative Years Born in Penang, Malaysia, he attended Penang Free School (1961-1962) and entered Cheltenham College (Gloucestershire,1962-1967).[2] He qualified in architecture from the AA (Architectural Association) School of Architecture (London) where he did freelance illustrations and graphic work for the AD, AAQ magazines and for the AA. His dissertation at Cambridge University, \\"A Theoretical Framework for Incorporating Ecological Considerations in the Design and Planning of the Built Environment\\" earned him a PhD, published as ‚ÄòDesigning With Nature‚Äô (McGraw-Hill, 1995)[2] and as 'Proyectar Con La Naturaleza‚Äô (Gustavo Gili, SA, 1999). Academically, he holds the Distinguished Plym Professor chair (University of Illinois, USA, 2005). His honorary degrees include D.Litt.(Hon.) (Sheffield University, UK 2004), PhD (Hon.) (University of Malaya, 2013), D. Arch (Hon.) (Universidad Ricardo Palma, Peru 2016), D.Sc (Hon.) (Taylors University, Malaysia 2017). Yeang attended courses on ecology (Department of Environmental Biology at Cambridge University), partial attendance in ecological landuse planning (Department of Landscape Architecture, University Pennsylvania, under Ian McHarg). These provided the ecological basis for Yeang‚Äôs work and work on his biodiversity and ecomimcry approach to ecological architecture and masterplanning, joining the British Ecological Society in 1975. Other courses attended includes business management at the Malaysian Institute of Management, the Singapore Institute of Management and a short course at Harvard Business School. Professional Career He is registered as an architect with ARB (Architects Registration Board) (UK, 1972), RIBA (Royal Institute of Architects) (UK), PAM (Pertubuhan Arkitek Malaysia), and Singapore Institute of Architects (SIA). He is a Fellow of the SIA, Fellow (Hon.) of the AIA (American institute of Architects), Fellow (Hon.) of the Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, and Fellow (Hon.) Wolfson College, Cambridge University. Yeang interned at S.T.S. Leong (Singapore, 1969‚Äì70), worked at Louis de Soisson Partnership (1969), Akitek Bersekutu (Kuala Lumpur,1974) and joined fellow AA alumni, Tengku Datuk Robert Hamzah as T. R.

Yeang also served as Design Director and Chairman for Llewelyn Davies Ken Yeang (UK, 2005) until it was dissolved in 2012 . Yeang has completed over 12 bioclimatic eco high-rise buildings, several thousand dwellings (terraced houses), over two million sq. ft. interior design space, numerous eco-masterplans and eco-city designs. Yeang lectures extensively at conferences and schools of architecture (over 30 countries worldwide). He currently holds the Distinguished Plym Professorship chair (University of Illinois).

Work on Ecological Design Yeang's research and technical work is in ecological architecture and masterplanning, establishing the formal basis for design, focussing on the biointegration of the human-made with nature, creating hybrid systems as ‚Äòconstructed ecosystems‚Äô. His work adopts bioclimatic design (climate-responsive passive low-energy) as a subset to ecological design, providing for him an underlying armature for ecological design. The approach also engenders critical regionalist features where climatic responses provide the links to its locality. A key project is Yeang‚Äôs own house, the 'Roof-Roof' House (1985) which is his early experimental bioclimatic built work. The dwelling has an identifiable curved louvred umbrella-like upper roof-structure that functions as a solar-filtering device and device that shades the building's lower roof terrace. Its side 'wind wing-walls' directs wind into the dining area. The swimming pool on the east functions as an evaporative-cooling device bring in the predominantly easterly breeze into the adjoining internal living spaces. The many features make the building an instructive reference prototype for his subsequent work on climate-responsive and ecological architecture. Influences can be further found in Yeang's later building and planning work. Yeang applied the bioclimatic passive-mode principles to the high-rise tower typology. Contending that the high-rise tower as an intensive built form will not go away overnight because of its existent economic basis arising from high urban land values and ability to accommodate rapid urban growth. He sought ecologically benign ways to make this built form green and humane to inhabit. Professor Udo Kulterman (Washington University) credits him as the inventor of the 'bioclimatic skyscraper', The Mesiniaga Tower with its elevator core on the left side of the photograph The Mesiniaga Tower (an IBM Franchise, 1992) brought together earlier experimental bioclimatic ideas in a single built form, such as the placement of the elevator core as a solar buffers to the tower's hot sides, placement of toilets and stairwells with natural ventilation opportunities, adopting various solar-path shaped sun-shades, use of an evaporative-cooling pool at the uppermost level, the overhead louvred canopy as a framework for future PV cells, and the vegetated and stepped fa√ßade and recessed sky-terraces as interstitial semi-enclosed spaces for building's users. This building as a prototype received several awards including the Aga Khan Award for Architecture (1993), The Malaysian Institute of Architects Award, the Singapore Institute of Architects Award, The Royal Australian Institute of Architects Award and a citation from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). The Solaris building (Singapore, 2008) brought together his ideas on ecological architecture with a continuous landscaped ramp and other experimental devices. His ideas for an urban park-in-the-sky in the high-rise building type is manifested as a 'vertical linear park' in his Solaris Building (2011) at 1-North Singapore that is a benchmark building in his green agenda for designing buildings asbiointgratin with nature. The building has an ecologically-linked vegetated pedestrian walkway ramp that is 1.3 km in length as a 'vertical linear park', punctuated by sky garden terraces located at each of the building's corners, further linked to a mid- level and to the uppermost-level roof gardens. His work on biodiversity and systemic biointegrattion were implemented in the Suasana Putrajaya (Putrajaya, 2017) based on a 'biodiversity targets matrix' originally proposed for the GyeonGi Masterplan (Seoul, Korea). The Solaris' vertical linear park device led to his concept of the continuous 'green eco-infrastructure', a device that enables a vital ecological nexus between the built form and its surrounding landscape, bioregion and its hinterland, that became habitats and a crucial biodiversity and wildlife corridor in all his subsequent masterplanning and eco-city design work (e.g. the SOMA Masterplan in Bangalore, India) and in his architecture (e.g. the Spire Edge Tower, in Gurgaon, India, completion c. 2015). This green eco-infrastructure concept led to his developing a unifying platform for eco-masterplanning as the weaving together of 'four sets of eco- infrastructures' into a unified system. Yeang work on the high-rise typology as 'vertical green urbanism' (c.1990‚Äôs) sought to reinvent the skyscraper as 'vertical urban design'.[4] His ideas invert the high-rise typology as a 'city-in-the-sky', first exemplified in the National Library Singapore (2005). The building features large 40m high 'public realms-in-the sky' as verdantly landscaped 'skycourt gardens', a ground plane as an 'open-to-the-sky' plaza for public festivals and culture-related activities. The thickened first floor slab over the plaza functions bioclimatically as an evaporative-cooling mass to the public realm below. Multiple upper-level sky-bridges link the building's two blocks (one containing the book collections and the other shaped block for programming activities. The naturally-ventilated atrium between the blocks has a ventilating louvred canopy that serves as its 'fifth facade'. There are two multi-volume reading rooms are located at either sides. At the uppermost roof is a promontory viewing pod. The building's built form has an organic geometry in his on-going explorations to derive an ecological aesthetic (see below). The building received Singapore‚Äôs BCA Green Mark Platinum rating. Yeang worked on the Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital Extension (London, UK) (completed 2011) as a green healthcare facility in a temperate climate. The building has a mixed-mode flue-wall providing natural ventilation during the mid-seasons to the Walt Disney operated ground floor Caf√©, a sedum-planted roof, with various low energy building systems (CHP, etc.), use of green materials, etc. The building is BREEAM rated 'excellent'. His work on the development of a 'platform' for eco-masterplaning and designing eco-cities regards designing the built environment as 'a living system' that is both interactive and functional through the bio-integration of the 'four eco-infrastructural armatures' into an overall coherent system The approach provides an indeterminate framework enabling inclusivity of changing complex factors and technologies in a flexibility that allows for technological obsolescence while encouraging innovation.[5] A theoretical rigorousness underpins his work. His earlier Cambridge doctoral dissertation (1975) presents a unifying comprehensive theoretical model for eco-design defining the prime factors in eco-design in four sets of interdependent 'environmental interactions', assembled in a mathematical 'partitioned- matrix'. This theoretical model continues to serve as the underlying guiding framework for his present eco-architecture and eco-masterplanning work. The impact of Yeang's work on architecture is based on his patterns of biointegration of biotic constituents with the inorganic structure of the built environment. The approach involves creating viable habitats within the development and then matching these with selected native fauna species whether for feeding, breeding or refuge to enhance local biodiversity. These are matched with selected flora species in a composite 'biodiversity matrix '. This endeavour takes eco-design beyond accreditation systems, likely as the next stage in green design, redefining the relationship of the built systems with the ecology of the landscape, enabling a higher level of bio-integration. In Yeang's oeuvre of design, built and theoretical work, his most important and instructive contribution is his advancing the macro ecology-based landuse planning approach of the landscape architect Ian McHarg and in extending and articulating this from its macro urban regional scale to the micro level of architectural design at the scale of the built form using his biointegation patterns. This was an endeavour that McHarg had sought to do but unable likely limited by being a landscape architect. His recent work explores the concept of 'eco-mimicry' as designing the built environment as constructed ecosystems that emulates the processes, structure and attributes of ecosystems. ‚ÄòEco- mimicry‚Äô is a concept he first used in his papers on the use of biological analogies in design in Yeang, K.(1972), Bases for Ecosystem Design, in Architectural Design, Architectural Press, London (1973)), and in Yeang, K. (1974), Bionics: The Use of Biological Analogies in Design, in AAQ No.4 (Architectural Association Quarterly), London, UK, The ideas can also be found in, Learning From Nature: The Ecomimicry Project (Marchall, Alex, poster paper, Environmental Education conference, Western Australia (2006). The term 'eco-mimicry' is regarded by Yeang as an outgrowth from the ‚Äòbio-mimicry‚Äô and 'eco-mimetics'. Yeang's eco-mimicry refers to physical, structural and systemic mimicry of ecosystems, and not to be mistaken with a simplistic 'visual' mimicry which he regards as superficial. Many regard Yeang‚Äôs work as simply placing vegetation in his builtforms or as just creating an ecological nexus (continuous link) within his builtforms to enhance local biodiversity. Yeang‚Äôs work does much more than the addition of greenery and landscaping in his builtforms. The unique factor is involves the creation of new habitats within and around the development, matching of selected native species with these constructed habitats, setting their ‚Äòbiodiversity targets‚Äô to achieve the expected level of biodiversity and providing physical conditions within these habitats to enable the selected species to survive over the seasons of the year. His built work become more than just ‚Äòvertically-landscaped architecture‚Äô but are in effect constructed ‚Äòliving systems‚Äô.[6] This differentiates his work from others who imitate his work by just placement of planting within their builtforms. Recognition and awards Hamzah & Yeang's design and built work have been recognised by the over 70 awards received since 1989 that include the: * Aga Khan Award for Architecture (for the Menara Mesiniaga, an IBM franchise) * Prince Claus Award (Netherlands, 1999) * The UIA (International Union of Architects) Auguste Perret Award * Several Malaysian Institute of Architects (PAM) annual design awards * The WACA (World Association of Chinese Architects) Gold Medals (for the Solaris Building, 2011 and for the National Library Singapore) * The Holcim Regional Award for Sustainability (Switzerland) (for the Putrajaya Phase 2C5 building, Malaysia, 2011), His personal awards include: ‚Ä¢ Liangsicheng Prize (2017), Architectural Society China ‚Ä¢ Greenseal Award (BCA, Singapore, 2016) * PAM (Malaysia Institute of Architects) Gold Medal ‚Ä¢ UIA Auguste Perret Award * Government of Malaysia‚Äôs ‚ÄòDarjah Mulia Pangkuan Negeri (DMPN) Award (that carries the official title of ‚ÄòDato‚Äô (2003) generally regarded as the Malaysian equivalent of the UK‚Äôs OBE) * Lynn S. Beedle Lifetime Achievement Award from the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (USA) * Merdeka Award (for the 'environment' category, 2011) from the Government of Malaysia, regarded as its national equivalent of the Nobel prize. 5\\\\. Ecological Aesthetic. Yeang pursuit of eco-architecture and eco-masterplanning theories, concepts and ideas have been carried out in parallel with an exploration for an 'ecological aesthetic', in questioning \\"...What a green building and masterplan should look like?\\" Yeang contends that an ecological architectural aesthetic should resemble a living system, looking natural, verdant and hirsute with nature and its processes visible in the bio-integration of the synthetic builtform's physical constituents (abiotic) with the native fauna, flora (the biotic constituents) and the environmental biological processes of the land. He contends that much of existent architecture and masterplans that lay claim by other elsewhere to be sustainable are simply commonly-styled or iconically- styled builtforms stuffed internally with eco-engineering gadgetry and with occasional vegetation in its upper open courts. Yeang contends that an eco- architecture and an eco-city should be 'alive' as a living system, analogous to a constructed ecosystem and not 'de-natured' nor look predominantly inorganic, artificial and synthetic. He adopts these assertions as the basis for his eco-architecture. Yeang contends that eco-architecture and eco- masterplans demand their own identifiable 'style'. It is this distinctive green vegetated eco-aesthetic in Yeang's architecture and masterplans that brought international attention to his work. His eco-aesthetic does not have the shape or form that in any way resemble existent architectural styles. This aesthetic is an independent aesthetic that encompasses eco-design holistically and which comes from an interpretation, an understanding and the inclusion of ecological constituents and processes of its locality in its built form. This can be regarded as an emergent ecological aesthetic, where its shapes and forms have a nexus with adjoining ecosystems, which harmonise with the site's ecology, enhance local biodiversity, besides having other eco performance features such denying negative consequences, avert polluting emissions, be more energy and water efficient and carbon neutral than conventional buildings, and other eco-design attributes. He sees the eco-architecture as designed like a 'constructed living system'. Lord Norman Foster of Thames Bank refers to Yeang's eco-aesthetics, \\"Ken Yeang has developed a distinctive architectural vocabulary that extends beyond questions of style to confront issues of sustainability and how we can build in harmony of the natural world.\\" (2011). Yeang's work in his relentless pursuit of an original bio- integrated 'ecological aesthetic' can be regarded as Yeang's other contribution to this field.

Stilt houses are built primarily as a protection against flooding; they also keep out vermin. The shady space under the house can be used for work or storage.  Arctic  Summer family dwellings of the natives of the Kamchatka Peninsula (Russia) called Itelmens or Kamchadals. Their winter dwellings were earth-sheltered and communal. Houses where permafrost is present, in the Arctic, are built on stilts to keep permafrost under them from melting. Permafrost can be up to 70% water. While frozen, it provides a stable foundation. However, if heat radiating from the bottom of a home melts the permafrost, the home goes out of level and starts sinking into the ground. Other means of keeping the permafrost from melting are available, but raising the home off the ground on stilts is one of the most effective ways. Indo-Pacific The raised bale houses of the Ifugao people with capped house posts are believed to be derived from the designs of traditional granaries Raised rectangular houses are one of the cultural hallmarks of the Austronesian peoples and are found throughout the regions in Island Southeast Asia, Island Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia settled by Austronesians. The structures are raised on piles, usually with the space underneath also utilized for storage or domestic animals. The raised design had multiple advantages, they mitigate damage during flooding and (in very tall examples) can act as defensive structures during conflicts. The house posts are also distinctively capped with larger- diameter discs at the top, to prevent vermin and pests from entering the structures by climbing them. Austronesian houses and other structures are usually built in wetlands and alongside bodies of water, but can also be built in the highlands or even directly on shallow water. Latte period Chamorro buildings raised on capped stone pillars called haligi Building structures on pilings is believed to be derived from the design of raised rice granaries and storehouses, which are highly important status symbols among the ancestrally rice-cultivating Austronesians. The rice granary shrine was also the archetypal religious building among Austronesian cultures and was used to store carvings of ancestor spirits and local deities. While rice cultivation wasn't among the technologies carried into Remote Oceania, raised storehouses still survived. The pataka of the MƒÅori people is an example. The largest pataka are elaborately adorned with carvings and are often the tallest buildings in the MƒÅori pƒÅ. These were used to store implements, weapons, ships, and other valuables; while smaller pataka were used to store provisions. A special type of pataka supported by a single tall post also had ritual importance and were used to isolate high-born children during their training for leadership. The majority of Austronesian structures are not permanent. They are made from perishable materials like wood, bamboo, plant fiber, and leaves. Because of this, archaeological records of prehistoric Austronesian structures are usually limited to traces of house posts, with no way of determining the original building plans. Indirect evidence of traditional Austronesian architecture, however, can be gleaned from their contemporary representations in art, like in friezes on the walls of later Hindu-Buddhist stone temples (like in reliefs in Borobudur and Prambanan). But these are limited to the recent centuries. They can also be reconstructed linguistically from shared terms for architectural elements, like ridge-poles, thatch, rafters, house posts, hearth, notched log ladders, storage racks, public buildings, and so on. Linguistic evidence also makes it clear that stilt houses were already present among Austronesian groups since at least the Late Neolithic. Arbi et al. (2013) have also noted the striking similarities between Austronesian architecture and Japanese traditional raised architecture (shinmei-zukuri). Particularly the buildings of the Ise Grand Shrine, which contrast with the pit-houses typical of the Neolithic Yayoi period. They propose significant Neolithic contact between the people of southern Japan and Austronesians or pre-Austronesians that occurred prior to the spread of Han Chinese cultural influence to the islands. Rice cultivation is also believed to have been introduced to Japan from a para-Austronesian group from coastal eastern China. Waterson (2009) has also argued that the architectural tradition of stilt houses in eastern Asia and the Pacific is originally Austronesian, and that similar building traditions in Japan and mainland Asia (notably among Kra-Dai and Austroasiatic-speaking groups) correspond to contacts with a prehistoric Austronesian network. Americas Castro, Chilo√© Archipelago, Chile Stilt houses were also built by Amerindians in pre- Columbian times. Palafitos are especially widespread along the banks of the tropical river valleys of South America, notably the Amazon and Orinoco river systems. Stilt houses were such a prevalent feature along the shores of Lake Maracaibo that Amerigo Vespucci was inspired to name the region \\"Venezuela\\" (little Venice). As the costs of hurricane damage increase, more and more houses along the Gulf Coast are being built as or converted to stilt houses. Stilt houses are also still common in parts of the Mosquito Coast in northeastern Nicaragua, northern Brazil, Africa Stilted granaries are also a common feature in West Africa, e.g., in the Malinke language regions of Mali and Guinea.  Europe  Many of the buildings in Halibut Cove, Alaska, are stilt houses. Lake Constance, Pfahlbaumuseum Unteruhldingen, Germany In the Neolithic and the Bronze Age, stilt-house settlements were common in the Alpine and Pianura Padana (Terramare) regions. Remains have been found at the Ljubljana Marshes in Slovenia and at the Mondsee and Attersee lakes in Upper Austria, for example. Early archaeologists like Ferdinand Keller thought they formed artificial islands, much like the Irish and Scottish crannogs, but today it is clear that the majority of settlements were located on the shores of lakes and were only inundated later on. Reconstructed stilt houses are shown in open-air museums in Unteruhldingen and Z√ºrich (Pfahlbauland). In June 2011, the prehistoric pile dwellings in six Alpine states were designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. A single Scandinavian pile dwelling, the Alvastra stilt houses, has been excavated in Sweden. Herodotus has described in his Histories the dwellings of the \\"lake-dwellers\\" in Paeonia and how those were constructed.Herodotus, Histories, 5.16 In the Alps, similar buildings, known as raccards, are still in use as granaries. In England, granaries are placed on staddle stones, similar to stilts, to prevent mice and rats getting to the grain.

She was known for her stage work in Las Vegas and as the lead actress in the Ilsa film franchise which began with Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1975). Career Dyanne Thorne began her career in show business as a band vocalist and New York stage actress. She also worked as a comedic sketch artist/talking foil. Comedy albums, with Allen & Rossi, Vaughn Meader and Loman & Barkley, earned her appearances on many T.V. variety shows such as The Tonight Show, Red Skelton, Steve Allen, Merv Griffin, and with Tim Conway at Caesar's Palace Hotel in Las Vegas. Filmed in New York City, Thorne's first film role was in Norman Chaitin's short Encounter (1965), which was also an early screen credit for Robert De Niro. Moving to Hollywood to appear in Star Trek, and star as another villainess in Crown International's thriller Point of Terror (1971), led to further film roles. In 1975, Thorne married composer, conductor, musician and actor Howard Maurer. The couple subsequently starred in five films together, co-produced and starred in several Las Vegas Strip showroom productions and their careers took them around the world. As an actress, Thorne was known for her characterisation of the heinous international dominatrix and soldier of fortune \\"Ilsa\\". After her debut as Ilsa in Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS (1975), she reprised the role in the sequels Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks (1976), Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia and an unofficial entry Greta, the Mad Butcher (both 1977), the last directed by Jess Franco. Later years Thorne started but did not complete studies for a degree in anthropology. She claimed to have earned a degree in comparative religion over the course of ten years of study. As church ordained, non-denominational ministers, Thorne and Maurer created A Scenic Outdoor Wedding as an alternative to commercial chapel weddings. Couples worldwide travelled to Las Vegas to be married by Ilsa. Death Dyanne Thorne died in Las Vegas on January 28, 2020 from pancreatic cancer at the age of 83.

He did his primary studies at the gymnasium in Oldenzaal, completed his higher studies in the Seminary of 's-Heerenberg on 10 March 1838 and was ordained a priest at Oegstgeest. First employed as a chaplain in his hometown, he was appointed pastor of Ommerschans five years later. In 1846 moved to Assen, where he stayed eight years, and was then appointed pastor in Zwolle.http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=9&page;=488&size;=800&accessor;=accessor_index&view;=imagePane Funeral of Archbishop Schaepman at St. Maartenskerk, Utrecht Schaepman was in 1857 the first president of the seminary Rijsenburg in Driebergen.http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn2/heukelum A year later he was also appointed vicar general and on 13 July 1860 to coadjutor and bishop of Hesebon Esbus in partibus. Schaepman was ordained titular bishop of Esbus and auxiliary of Utrecht on 26 August 1860 at Rijsenburg by Franciscus Jacobus van Vree, Bishop of Haarlem. After the resignation of Msgr. Johannes Zwijsen, in 1868, he was appointed to the metropolitan see, and so became the second Archbishop of Utrecht, after the restoration of the Roman Catholic hierarchy in the country. After the death of Archbishop Johannes Zwijsen, Schaepman campaigned for the emancipation of Catholicism in the Netherlands. He supported the establishment of Catholic schools and founded congregations such as the Brothers of Utrecht and the Sisters of St. Joseph who devoted themselves to Catholic education. Schaepman promoted religious art, music and history, that were never Zwijsen priorities. Even before his appointment as archbishop, he organized the restoration of St. Catherine Cathedral in Utrecht in neo-Gothic style, together with Gerard van Heukelum (1834-1910), founder of the St. Bernulphusgilde and chaplain of the cathedral). Schaepman and Van Heukelum were also at the basis of what is now the Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht. Schaepman had favored architect Wilhelm Victor Alfred Tepe, giving him a virtual monopoly on the building of new Catholic churches in the metropolitan territories of the Archdiocese of Utrecht. Only after the death of Archbishop Schaepman in 1882, was this monopoly slightly affected, and other architects had a chance of competing.http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN/lemmata/bwn2/tepe Schaepman attended the First Vatican Council in part.

It publishes detailed and checked procedures for the synthesis of organic compounds. A unique feature of the review process is that all of the data and experiments reported in an article must be successfully repeated in the laboratory of a member of the editorial board as a check for reproducibility prior to publication. The journal is published by Organic Syntheses, Inc., a non-profit corporation. An annual print version is published by John Wiley & Sons on behalf of Organic Syntheses, Inc.  History  Prior to World War I, work on synthetic organic chemistry in the United States had been quite limited, and most of the reagents used in laboratories had to be imported from Europe. When export stoppages and trade embargoes cut off this source, Clarence Derick, a professor of chemistry at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, began an effort to synthesize these needed chemicals in industrial quantities in a university laboratory with the help of a few graduate students. This work was performed during the summer break and came to be known as the \\"summer prep\\". Students who worked in the laboratory were paid and received credit. The basic procedures were often obtained from textbooks, and the procedures were sketchy. Reproducibility was important in summer preps, so students were required to keep meticulous record books. The procedures were finally collected and published for the first time in a four- pamphlet set called Organic Chemical Reagents, which quickly sold out. The publishers received submissions from other chemists, which spawned the idea for serial publication, and the first annual volume of Organic Syntheses was thus published in 1921. By then, chemists from other universities and industry were also contributing. One example of much needed chemicals were dyes for sensitizing photographic film. Research efforts in this field led to the foundation of Eastman Kodak Organic Chemicals Division. The summer preps contributed to the war effort in World War II but were discontinued in 1950 because by then an infrastructure of chemical companies with their own research had been established. Until 1998, Organic Syntheses was published only as an annual printed volume. In that year, all past volumes were made available on an open access website and new articles are now published online as soon as they are accepted.4  See also  * Organic Reactions  References  External links  * * Organic Syntheses at John Wiley's Online Library Category:Organic chemistry journals Category:Publications established in 1921 Category:Open access journals Category:Wiley (publisher) academic journals Category:English-language journals ","title":"Organic Syntheses"},{"id":"1879265","text":"The Lloyd Noble Center is a 10,967-seat multi-purpose arena located in Norman, Oklahoma, some south of downtown Oklahoma City. It opened in 1975 and is home to the University of Oklahoma men's and women's basketball teams. History Before the construction of the facility, the teams played in the much smaller OU Field House, located on campus near Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. With the success of Sooner basketball in the 1970s and star forward Alvan Adams, demand became sufficient to upgrade to the modern and spacious Lloyd Noble Center, named after an alumnus and former member of the OU Board of Regents who gave OU's first ever $1 million gift to finance the center. The Sooners frequently sold out the arena during the Billy Tubbs era, with All-American forward Wayman Tisdale leading the high-scoring team to several Big Eight Conference titles and NCAA Tournament appearances. This led to the popular colloquialism around Norman that Lloyd Noble Center is \\"the house that Alvan built and Wayman filled.\\" In January 2006, the NBA and the New Orleans Hornets decided to move two games from the Pete Maravich Assembly Center in Baton Rouge to Oklahoma City due to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent low attendance it caused. The Ford Center in Oklahoma City was unavailable for one of the games against the Sacramento Kings, so it was moved to the Lloyd Noble Center. The center was named after Samuel Lloyd Noble (1896‚Äì1950), a Houston oilman and philanthropist, and founder of the Noble Corporation and the Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation. Concerts As a concert venue, the Lloyd Noble Center can hold between 2,848 and 4,516 in a theater set-up, 6,165 for end-stage concerts, and 11,238 for center-stage concerts. The arena contains of arena floor space as well as of concourse space, allowing for trade shows to be held at the arena. The arena stands only tall since the majority of the structure is under ground (including the entire lower arena level), and contains a portable stage and a state-of-the-art scoreboard and video system. There are 12 concession stands at the concourse. Amy Grant recorded half of her live albums, In Concert and In Concert Volume Two, here. Elvis Presley performed two back-to-back concerts at the center on March 25 & 26 1977. He died five months after the concerts on August 16, 1977.

He also founded Barkerville which is preserved as a historic town. Biography Barker was born in 1817 in March, Cambridgeshire, England and was baptised on 7 June 1817 in St Wendreda's Church, March. As a child he worked as a waterman on the waterways of England. He married widow Jane Lavender in Bluntisham, Huntingdonshire in 1839 and they had one daughter named Emma Eliza (born 1840). Because railways had begun to replace canal transport, Barker, in the 1840s, decided he would try his luck in America. He left his wife and child in England in penury and his wife died in the workhouse in Doddington, Cambridgeshire in 1850. He made little in California, but when the California Gold Rush ended, he moved up to British Columbia with many fellow miners as part of the British Columbia gold rushes. His party discovered gold in the Williams Creek area, and his fellow crew member \\"Dutch Bill\\" Wilhelm Dietz was the first to find a good amount of gold in the Creek Valley area. In 1862, Barker decided to search for gold down river, close to Stout's Gulch. Many people said he was crazy for doing this, but, after a short period of time, they pulled out about of gold at about 52 feet below ground. Barker's claim turned out to be the richest in the area and the settlement of Barkerville was set up around his claim. He pulled out roughly 37,500 oz of gold in his life. It was said that Barker smoked as many as 30 cigarettes a day, finding it hard to deal with the stress of having that much gold, and the progressive symptoms of Parkinson's disease. In 1863, Barker married the widow Elizabeth Collyer; she died on 21 May 1865 at the age of 38. The previous year Barker had sold his shares in the claim that had made him famous, since most of the \\"lead\\" gold had been cleared out. He may have thought he had made enough to live comfortably and still invest in further ventures, but his fortunes declined. His reputed generosity may also have contributed to his impoverishment. He died penniless in a Victoria nursing home on 11 July 1894 with symptoms of Parkinson's disease and/or possible cancer in his jaw. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Ross Bay Cemetery but there has been talk of moving his grave to Barkerville, which is preserved as a historic town.

He is a vampire and is devoted entirely to the current head of the Hellsing family (Integra Hellsing during the timeline of the story) and good friends with Walter. He also feels admiration towards his fledgling, Seras Victoria. Alucard works with the Hellsing Organization against other vampires and evil forces. He fights with ferocity and cruelty, sometimes only killing after his target has been disabled and humiliated, while frequently allowing enemies more than one chance to kill him (though he seeks only to be killed by a human, having grown bored of immortality and life). As revealed in volume 8 of the manga, he is Count Dracula (\\"Alucard\\" is \\"Dracula\\" spelled backwards). Soon after the events presented in Bram Stoker's original novel, Dracula was defeated by Abraham Van Helsing and became the family's loyal servant. Decades later, Abraham's descendant Arthur Hellsing gives the Count his current name: \\"Alucard\\". The manga is set over a hundred years later, where the Hellsing Organization is forced to fight the remnants of a Nazi battalion. He typically dresses in a distinctive Victorian and western fashion, with a charcoal suit, leather riding boots, a red cravat, and a long red duster (resembling Van Helsing's duster). He also wears a red fedora with a wide, floppy brim which he uses to cover his long black shaggy hair, and a pair of circular, wire-framed sunglasses (which are similar in design to glacier sunglasses and old-fashioned Wilson welding glasses). However, this form seems to be a part of his being as he can change it at will. In the anime (both the TV series and OVA) Alucard is voiced by Jouji Nakata. Character outline=Background Volume 8 features flashbacks of Alucard's life as a human. Dracula starts his career by fighting the Ottomans, believing that God does not reward prayer, but instead wants mortals to show their faith visibly. However, when his army is defeated and he is about to be executed, Vlad, believing he has been abandoned by God, turns his back on the divine. It is not explicitly shown or stated how he became a vampire, but in one scene he drinks blood from the floor in front of an executioner.Hirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 8. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 184‚Äì199. . The series mentions the events of Bram Stoker's Dracula, but deviates at the point of Dracula's defeat. In Hellsing, he was staked in the heart but not destroyed. It is unknown if he was forced into servitude or was willing, but he became a servant of the Van Helsing family, who not only augmented his formidable abilities, but also placed shackles on his power. He, along with a young Walter C. Dornez, were sent to Warsaw, Poland to stop Millennium's vampire production program.Hirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 4. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 110. . Integra's father eventually imprisoned Alucard in a dungeon in the Hellsing manor, as he believed the vampire was too powerful to be used frequently.Hirano, Kohta (2008). Hellsing, Volume 9. Dark Horse Comics. p. 68. . After 20 years of imprisonment, Integra, marked for death by her traitorous uncle, opened Alucard's crypt as a final resort. Her blood awakened and resuscitated the ancient vampire, who then executed Integra's uncle and his followers, and willingly entered the service of Integra.Hirano, Kohta (2003). Hellsing, Volume 1. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 44‚Äì59. . While the TV series does not include the same scenes to explicitly state that Alucard is Dracula, the end of the anime series implied that he is Vlad the Impaler, one of the original inspirations for Dracula. In the OVA series, however, it is much more explicitly stated that he is Dracula. In episode 8 of the OVA, he is shown as his former self wearing medieval armor, a long black cape (blood red on the inside), long hair, a mustache, and a long sword. Personality In most depictions, Alucard is violent, sadistic, and masochistic. He often taunts and belittles his opponents, allowing them to inflict wounds before regenerating and retaliating, as shown in his first appearance in the manga.Hirano, Kohta (2003). Hellsing, Volume 1. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 22‚Äì26. . He longs for battleHirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 8. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 89. . and has been shown to become angry when his opponents kill themselves. His thirst for battle is fueled by a desire to find an opponent powerful enough to end his eternal life, although he really wishes only to be slain by a human, for \\"Only a human can destroy a monster. Only a human could dare hope to.\\" He expresses admiration for some humans, calling Integra's order to kill \\"splendid\\"Hirano, Kohta (2004). Hellsing, Volume 3. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 90. . and the determination of his rival, Alexander Anderson, to destroy him an example of the \\"fantastic\\" and \\"magnificent\\" qualities of humans.Hirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 8. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 108. He recognizes Anderson as a parallel to himself, and pities him.Hirano, Kohta (2008). Hellsing, Volume 9. Dark Horse Comics. pp. 26‚Äì27. . He has great respect for these humans, going as far as to say he would have been proud if Anderson had killed him in his human form.Hirano, Kohta (2008). Hellsing, Volume 9. Dark Horse Comics. pp. 149. . As the manga continues, it becomes increasingly evident that Alucard is deeply depressed and is struggling with his nature as a vampire.Hirano, Kohta (2008). Hellsing, Volume 9. Dark Horse Comics. pp. 129. . It can be said that he considers vampirism a step down from humanity, and regrets the choice he made when becoming a vampire.Hirano, Kohta (2008). Hellsing, Volume 8. Dark Horse Comics. pp. 165. Alucard occasionally expresses disgust with the vampires he hunts, notably when they kill without purpose. Commenting on the \\"Bonnie and Clyde\\" in the story, he mentions the two vampires' killing as unnecessary.Hirano, Kohta (2003). Hellsing, Volume 1. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 80‚Äì81. . Abilities Alucard is not immortal (he himself has said \\"There is no such thing as immortals\\") but he does not age. In reality, Alucard's lack of senescence comes from the number of humans whose blood he consumed over the ages, which is a number in the millions.Hirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 4. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 109. . As many come to realize, whenever he drinks his victim's blood, Alucard also sucks out the soul of that person to obtain their memories while converting the victim into an extension of himself referred to as a Familiar.Hirano, Kohta (2007). Hellsing, Volume 4. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 28, 57. . When he retains all the claimed souls within his body, Alucard can easily regenerate from near fatal injuries in seconds.Hirano, Kohta (2004). Hellsing, Volume 3. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 62‚Äì67. .Hirano, Kohta (2003). Hellsing, Volume 1. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. pp. 166‚Äì167. . His regenerative abilities took even Anderson by surprise in their first encounter; Alucard was able to reconstitute himself within minutes of being decapitated and having his heart pierced, injuries that would kill an ordinary vampire. Alucard exhibits incredible accuracy when firing his twin large caliber handguns (his basic set being chambered in .454 Casull; a more powerful pair, codenamed 'Jackal' and armed with explosive rounds, was designed to fight regenerators like Father Anderson, Luke Valentine, and Incognito), and is capable of accurately shooting targets while looking the other way.Hirano, Kohta (2003).

He communicates telepathically with Seras and can hypnotize other characters. He is also immune to the harmful effects of sunlight, though he avoids it due to it weakening his powers; he misses the sunlight. He sees the same sunrise each time he dies and, every time, remembers how beautiful it is.Hirano, Kohta (2004). Hellsing, Volume 3. Dark Horse Books/Digital Manga Publishing. p. 25. . Alucard's power is restrained by a series of seals presumably made by Hellsing (known as the Control Ark Restriction System). Alucard can release the seals up to Level 1, where numerous eyeballs surround his body and can manifest a massive \\"Hellhound\\" named Baskerville. He also trades his traditional red fedora and duster for a black straight jacket with a large eyeball coming out of the center of his chest. When Integra Hellsing releases Level 0, the final seal, Alucard can assume the form he had in his previous life while manifesting all of his familiars into an undead army of over 3 million. Though this is his most powerful form, it also leaves Alucard vulnerable to attack, as the souls he consumed no longer reside in his body to give him regenerations; though he can draw familiars back into himself, any that are destroyed must be replaced through feeding. Anderson, augmented by the Nail of Helena, managed to critically injure Alucard during their final duel, which created a chain reaction that destroyed all Alucard's familiars except Luke Valentine and the Hellhound. Although Alucard recovered thanks to Seras' intervention and successfully defeated Anderson, he was then attacked by Walter, who had undergone vampirization by Millennium in order to kill Alucard when he was most vulnerable. However, Walter was tricked (via illusion) into killing Valentine instead; before he could get another chance to land a fatal blow, Alucard began absorbing the blood of the millions who died in the Battle of London, thus giving himself an indefinite number of regenerations and a new army of the dead. Unknown to Alucard, Schr√∂dinger had killed himself and fallen into the river of blood on the Major's orders; mixed in with the millions of other souls Alucard had consumed, he was unable to recognize himself and therefore neither he nor Alucard was able to exist, causing Alucard to vanish. However, after Alucard destroyed every additional soul except Schr√∂dinger's in his body, he gained the ability to exist \\"everywhere and nowhere\\". Reception Crispin Freeman received praise for how demonic and psychotic he made Alucard sound. In the Society for the Promotion of Japanese Animation Awards from 2008, Alucard was nominated as one of the best male characters. In an interview with Anime News Network, American voice actor Crispin Freeman stated that he enjoyed voicing Alucard, stating that he loved \\"characters who are on the edge of madness for one reason or another\\". Various merchandise based on Alucard's appearance has been created, including action figures, bust figures and key-chains. Anime News Network's Mike Crandol praised Alucard for being \\"a refreshing change from the traditional, mopey, woe-is-me vampire anti-hero\\", and called him \\"quite the cool figure\\". T.H.E.M Anime Reviews describes Alucard as \\"anti-hero through and through, but you just can't help rooting for him even when it's obvious he's not really a good guy at all...\\" Carl Kimlinger also from Anime News Network said \\"Hellsing's greatest attribute, without doubt, is Alucard. He's one of the scariest, and most unspeakably cool, anti-heroes to ever slaughter his way through an anime.\\" Jason Thompson commented that when the manga started \\"Alucard looked too much like Master of Mosquiton, or another badass manga character with John Lennon glasses\\" and thought he seems like Vash the Stampede and his backstory is similar to Vlad the Impaler. IGN ranked him as the 21st greatest anime character of all time, saying that \\"There have been many vampires in anime, but none have been as deliciously sadistic as Alucard.\\" ReferencesExternal links Category:Anime and manga characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Anime and manga characters who can teleport Category:Anime and manga characters with accelerated healing Category:Anime and manga characters with superhuman strength Category:Anime and manga telepaths Category:Comics characters introduced in 1997 Category:Cultural depictions of Vlad the Impaler Category:Dracula in written fiction Category:Fictional assassins Category:Fictional British people Category:Fictional Romanian people Category:Fictional characters who can turn intangible Category:Fictional characters who can manipulate darkness or shadows Category:Fictional characters who can move at superhuman speeds Category:Fictional characters with immortality Category:Fictional child sexual abuse victims Category:Fictional counts and countesses Category:Fictional demons and devils Category:Fictional demon hunters Category:Fictional genetically engineered characters Category:Fictional mass murderers Category:Fictional private military members Category:Fictional shapeshifters Category:Fictional vampire hunters Category:Fictional World War II veterans Category:Hellsing characters Category:Male characters in anime and manga ","title":"Alucard (Hellsing)"},{"id":"1879292","text":"Endesa Termic Endesa Termic is a chimney belonging to the thermal power station (i.e.:coal power plant) held by Spanish utility Endesa at As Pontes de Garc√≠a Rodr√≠guez in the outskirts of Ferrol in the province of A Coru√±a, north-western Spain.

In 1930, she broke Amelia Earhart's air speed record. Barnes raced in the Women's Air Derby and was a member of the Ninety-Nines. In later years, she was known as the owner of the Happy Bottom Riding Club, a bar and restaurant in the Mojave Desert, Southern California, catering to the legendary test pilots and aviators who worked nearby.  Early years  She was born as Florence Leontine Lowe on July 22, 1901, to Thaddeus Lowe II (1870‚Äì1955) and his first wife, Florence May Dobbins, in Pasadena, California. She was born to a wealthy family, growing up in a huge mansion in San Marino, California. During her formative years, she attended the area's finest private schools. Her father, an avid sportsman, encouraged her to appreciate the great outdoors, and Florence became an accomplished equestrian. Her grandfather was Thaddeus S. C. Lowe, who had pioneered American aviation with the establishment of the nation's first military air unit, the Army of the Potomac's balloon corps during the American Civil War. He took his granddaughter to an air show when she was 10 years old. In 1919, Florence married Reverend C. Rankin Barnes of South Pasadena, California, and they had a son, William E. Barnes. Her mother died in 1924.  Aviation career  Having spent four months abroad in Mexico, getting caught up with revolutionaries and escaping the attention of authorities, disguised as a man, she began to use the nickname \\"Pancho\\" around this time. Barnes returned to San Marino, California, with an inheritance bequeathed to her on her parents' death. In 1928, while driving her cousin Dean Banks to flying lessons, she decided to learn to fly, and convinced her cousin's flight instructor, Ben Caitlin, a World War I veteran, of her desire that same day. She soloed after six hours of formal instruction. Barnes ran an ad-hoc barnstorming show and competed in air races. Despite a crash in the 1929 Women's Air Derby, she returned in 1930 under the sponsorship of the Union Oil Company to win the race ‚Äì and break Amelia Earhart's world women's speed record with a speed of . Barnes broke this record in a Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship. Pancho Barnes with Travel Air Type R Mystery Ship R613K, c. 1930s After her contract with Union Oil expired, Barnes moved to Hollywood to work as a stunt pilot for movies. In 1931, she started the Associated Motion Picture Pilots, a union of film industry stunt fliers which promoted flying safety and standardized pay for aerial stunt work. She flew in several air- adventure movies of the 1930s, including Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels (1930). Barnes had extensive connections in Hollywood. Her early close friend George Hurrell (1904‚Äì1992), then eking out a living as a painter and photographer in Laguna Beach, California, would later become the legendary head of the portrait department of MGM Studios. Barnes is credited with helping Hurrell start his career in Hollywood after he took the photo she was to use on her pilot's license, introducing him to her Hollywood friends.Postrel, Virginia. \\"Starlight and Shadow. George Hurrell's brilliantly orchestrated photographs helped define Hollywood glamour in the 1930s.\\" The Atlantic, July 1, 2007. Retrieved: December 25, 2010. In a short period of time, Hurrell became the most in-demand photographer in Hollywood. Barnes lost most of her money in the Great Depression. By 1935, she had only her apartment in Hollywood left. She sold it, and in March 1935 bought of land in the Mojave Desert, near the Rogers dry lake bed and the nascent Muroc Field, then called March Field because it was an adjunct property of March Army Air Base at that time.  The Happy Bottom Riding Club  On her land, Pancho Barnes built the Happy Bottom Riding Club, also known as the Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch, a dude ranch and restaurant which catered to airmen at the nearby airfield and her friends from Hollywood. Barnes became very close friends with many of the early test pilots, including Chuck Yeager, Robert Anderson \\"Bob\\" Hoover, Walt Williams, Jack Ridley, General Jimmy Doolittle, Buzz Aldrin, North American Aviation flight test mechanic Bob Cadick, and flight test supervisor Roy Ferren. Barnes' ranch became famous for the parties and high-flying lifestyle of all the guests.\\"Happy Bottom Riding Club.\\" Happybottomridingclub.com, November 24, 2012. After successful flight trials, the Muroc and Edwards test pilots often enjoyed some good times at the Happy Bottom Riding Club. As proprietor, Barnes would offer them a customary free steak dinner for breaking the sound barrier. A change of command in 1952, however, contributed to Barnes getting into a conflict with the United States Air Force (USAF). The USAF was planning for the future of aviation, and decided it needed to build a new, super-long runway to accommodate new aircraft that were being planned to run on atomic power. That new runway would run directly across her ranch. The USAF originally offered her a price for her ranch, land, and facilities that was very close to the cost of undeveloped desert land. She requested a fair appraisal to better reflect the actual cost of replacement of her land and business, but in the midst of getting a re-appraisal, the base leadership accused her of running a house of ill-repute on her ranch. The effect of even the hint of impropriety resulted in her ranch and business being put off- limits to military personnel, and the value of her business plummeted. Barnes then filed a lawsuit against the USAF to, as she put it, \\"Roust out the scoundrels in the government who would perpetrate such an injustice.\\" She knew that if she filed a lawsuit, she would have the opportunity to depose under oath the various leaders and personnel on base, and the truth would come out and clear her name. During the height of the intense court battle, in 1953, her ranch burned in a fire of mysterious origin. After the fire, the value of her ranch and business further plummeted to a level more closely reflecting the original buy-out offer from the USAF. Nonetheless, the court battle continued. Barnes was determined to receive fair value for her land and business, and to clear her name. A main contention of her case was: \\"My grandfather founded the United States Air Force.\\" On that argument, the court found in her favor and she was awarded $375,000 remuneration for her property and business. Also, her name was cleared. As it turned out, the proposed runway was never built. The remains of the Happy Bottom Riding Club, c. 1990s showing the extent of the fire that consumed the main buildings. After the government bought her out, she moved to Cantil, California, in hopes of restarting a similar dude ranch business there. It never happened. It was not until the late 1960s that Barnes once again became a commonplace figure at the base and began to be referred to as the \\"Mother of Edwards AFB.\\" The wounds began to heal as Barnes reconnected with many old-timers. The officer's mess at Edwards was renamed the Pancho Barnes Room.  Death  Barnes suffered from breast cancer, likely the ultimate cause of her death. She was scheduled to be the keynote speaker at the Antelope Valley Aero Museum's annual \\"Barnstormers Reunion\\" on April 5, 1975. However, when a friend called on March 30, 1975, she could not reach her. Her son Bill found her dead in her home, and the coroner determined that she had died nearly a week earlier. Bill obtained special permission, which was granted from the United States Air Force, to spread her ashes over the site of the Happy Bottom Riding Club. He then flew an aircraft over the site, but a crosswind came up, sweeping the ashes back into the small Cessna aircraft, to be carried aloft again. \\"Even in death Barnes still loved a good joy ride.\\"  Legacy  Her fourth husband, Eugene \\"Mac\\" McKendry, continued to live in Cantil and survived Barnes for many years. Son Bill Barnes died piloting a North American P-51 Mustang flying near Fox Field in Lancaster in October 1980. In 1940, she had founded Barnes Aviation of Lancaster, which Bill operated in his adult years. It remains in the general aviation business today. Her life and personality were portrayed in the 1983 epic film The Right Stuff, adapted from Tom Wolfe's bestselling book of the same name. Kim Stanley played her. She was also the subject of a heavily fictionalized 1988 TV film, Pancho Barnes, written by John Michael Hayes, directed by Richard Heffron, and starring Valerie Bertinelli. The first biography about Barnes was published in 1986, The Lady Who Tamed Pegasus: The Story of Pancho Barnes, written by Grover Ted Tate, who relied heavily upon the copyrighted autobiographical materials of Pancho Barnes. In 1996, a second biography appeared, Pancho: The Biography of Florence Lowe Barnes, written by Barbara Schultz. A third biography appeared in 2000, written by Lauren Kessler, The Happy Bottom Riding Club: The Life and Times of Pancho Barnes. PBS sponsored a documentary film, The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club, completed in 2009. In it, Kathy Bates provides the voice of Barnes. The documentary was made independently of the estate of Barnes. However, the estate gave the film makers full access to her personal papers and photographs as well as her copyrighted autobiography that are owned by the estate. The film, which chronicles Barnes' life story, was produced and written by Nick T. Spark and directed by Amanda Pope in affiliation with KOCE- TV, a PBS station in Orange County, California. The documentary won an Emmy for best arts and history documentary. Barnes' Mystery Ship #32 was for a long time located in a hangar at Mojave Airport. It was sold to a private collector a number of years ago, and is currently in the United Kingdom, where it has been restored. Members of the Ninety-Nines and their families talk to attendees at Pancho Barnes Day, November 7, 2009. The Happy Bottom Riding Club historical site is the location for the annual USAF Test Pilot School/Edwards Air Force Base Pancho Barnes Day celebration (established in 1980). A barbecue is held and drinks are served, along with dancing and live music in remembrance of this aviation pioneer and friend. Family hour extends until approximately 9 pm, after which it is an adults-only party, perhaps in remembrance of the raucous old days of Happy Bottom Riding Club.

Barnes and the club were both featured in Tom Wolfe's 1979 book, The Right Stuff, and the 1983 film adaptation. Also known as the Rancho Oro Verde Fly-Inn Dude Ranch, the establishment was a favored hangout for both test pilots and the Hollywood elite during the 1940s, boasting over 9,000 members worldwide at the height of its popularity. When the United States Air Force intended to buy the club via eminent domain in order to extend their runways, a long and contentious series of lawsuits ensued. Barnes eventually won the lawsuits, but after the club was destroyed by fire in the 1950s, her plans to re-open in a nearby location never came to fruition. Establishment In 1935, Barnes originally purchased the property where the club would later stand to grow alfalfa, raise pigs and cattle and start a dairy. As the nearby U.S. Army Air Corps base at Muroc Army Air Base expanded in the post World War II period, the ranch's other business as a restaurant, bar, and hotel quickly outgrew its humble beginnings. Eventually, the ranch also included a hospitality business with an all-female staff and it became a destination of choice for test pilot relaxation.Gibson 2013, pp. 137‚Äì138. Amenities Along with a swimming pool and a rodeo stadium, Rancho Oro Verde had an airstrip that was the first amenity Barnes created in 1935 to stay in touch with her aviator-friendly social circle from south of the San Gabriel Mountains. Visiting civilians and military men alike flew into the strip to stay at the Rancho Oro Verde, with Barnes often holding events to entertain her guests that included barbecues and a treasure hunt for 200 silver dollars. The rodeo stadium held three-day weekend rodeos jointly sponsored by the local VFW post in Lancaster.Happy Bottom Riding Club (photos, documents and ephemera). Retrieved on November 24, 2012. Archived from the original on October 26, 2013. The original swimming pool was rectangular, and was one of the first built in the Antelope Valley, but was destroyed by the 1952 Kern County earthquake. The replacement pool was circular and had a circular ramp which reportedly allowed Barnes to ride her horse into the pool. This later pool was modeled after one Barnes had owned in the Pasadena area. The pool was lit at night ‚Äî an aid to visual air navigation.Gibson 2013, p. 138. As depicted in the book and film The Right Stuff, a tradition was started when Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier in the Bell X-1 and Barnes provided him with a free steak dinner. After that, pilots were given a free steak dinner when they personally broke the sound barrier for the first time. Following Yeager's achievement, the sound barrier was broken frequently from Edwards AFB in the late 1940s and early 1950s with Barnes giving free dinners multiple times during the course of a week. Fire and sale The remains of the Happy Bottom Riding Club (1990s), showing the extent of the fire that ravaged the main buildings and left the estate in a much-depleted condition. Despite a friendship between Barnes and the military, relations grew sour after a change of command in 1952, four years after Muroc Army Air Base became Edwards Air Force Base. One reason for friction between Barnes and the base commander was the increase in flights out of Edwards, along with an increase in flights at the club's landing strip.Pelletier 2012, p. 70. After he assumed command at the base, General Albert Boyd, an admirer and friend of Barnes, would berate her if her clientele came too close to military airspace and flight paths. Allegations surfaced that the club was a brothel, something Barnes believed was connected to her refusal to sell the ranch to the government for a runway expansion. The rules Barnes posted for hostesses were strict, and many seemed to discredit the allegations. Acting on the rumors, however, the Air Force prohibited servicemen from visiting the club, destroying the vast majority of her business. Since she and the government were in the middle of negotiations regarding establishing a fair price for her business and property, Barnes felt betrayed by the prohibition. When the government added a suit to appropriate the ranch, Barnes counter-sued for slander, harassment, unlawful acquisition of land, and conspiracy. The ranch was destroyed by fire on November 13, 1953, shortly before the lawsuit concluded. Barnes ended up resettling in nearby Cantil and the land was purchased by the Air Force via eminent domain. The proposed runway expansion was never implemented. Barnes' plans to reestablish the Happy Bottom Riding Club on her and her husband's land in Cantil never materialized. Legacy Members of the Ninety-Nines talk to attendees of Pancho Barnes Day November 7, 2009. Along with depictions in The Right Stuff, the club was also immortalized in Lauren Kessler's biography of Barnes, The Happy Bottom Riding Club. Barnes' life was chronicled in a 2009 documentary film for PBS station KOCE-TV, entitled The Legend of Pancho Barnes and the Happy Bottom Riding Club. A made- for-TV movie aired on the CBS TV network, Pancho Barnes (1988), starring Valerie Bertinelli, featured a fictionalized version of Barnes' life and events relating to The Happy Bottom Riding Club. Chuck Yeager, who made a cameo appearance in The Right Stuff film as a patron of the club, stated \\"if all the hours were ever totaled, I reckon I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years.\\" Pancho's Happy Bottom Riding Club was listed on the Promenade directory as located in section 02-11 in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. Air Force personnel from Edwards hold an annual barbecue on the site of the Happy Bottom Riding Club in remembrance of Barnes and the ranch. Visitors may still see the remains of the pool, the restaurant's foundation (including chimney), and the barn. From the air, an outline of the airstrip is visible.

Vita Cola's flavor is described as cola-like with a strong note of lemon and fruit flavoring. It is also noticeably less sweet than Afri-Cola, Coca-Cola or Pepsi, and has a slightly thicker consistency due to its use of citrus and other aromatic oils in the formula. Vitasoy (an unrelated company) also produces a cola beverage branded as Vita Cola.  History and Popularity  Vita Cola started out in the German Democratic Republic. Introduced in 1957, it was advertised as Brauselimonade mit Frucht- und Kr√§utergeschmack (carbonated soft drink with fruit and herb flavoring), using a formula that is still kept secret (similar to Coca-Cola's \\"Merchandise 7X\\" formula). At its peak, Vita Cola was bottled in over 200 factories. After the fall of the Berlin Wall and Iron Curtain in 1989, Vita Cola's business quickly collapsed as Western cola brands took its place. However, with the advent of Ostalgie (nostalgia among East Germans for the \\"old days\\"), many former GDR products were brought back, Vita Cola being one of the most popular. The company Th√ºringer Waldquell from Schmalkalden, Thuringia, secured the rights to the name and formula and began producing Vita Cola in 1994.

It occurred during the twelve-year war between France and Spain (1547‚Äì1559). The battle resulted in a victory by the Spanish forces, led by Lamoral, Count of Egmont, over the French, led by Marshal Paul de Thermes. The Spanish were supported by the English Navy, who opened fire on the French as they reached the sand dunes at Gravelines.Collins Encyclopedia of Military History. Following the dominance of the Spanish forces, led by Duke Emmanuel Philibert of Savoy, at the Battle of St. Quentin, Henry II of France prepared his revenge. He recruited a new army in Picardy, which he put in the hands of Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers. He asked the Ottoman Sultan for naval support and encouraged the Scots to invade England from the north. Francis, Duke of Guise, seized the port of Calais from the English and moved to the city of Thionville (on the border between Flanders and France), a city that had been overtaken by the duke's army on 22 June 1558. Marshall de Thermes invaded with another army consisting of 12,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, armed with a considerable amount of artillery. After crossing the Aa River at its mouth, de Thermes commandeered his army to conquer both Dunkirk and Nieuwpoort, consequently threatening Brussels. It is reported that a Spanish army was to later intercept the duke's army at the Aa River. Development of the battle The Duke of Savoy and Philip met an army of 15,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry, giving the command to the Count of Egmont. Surprised by the speed of the Spanish maneuver, Thermes had to do battle because he had the river behind him, the sea on his left, and his right completely blocked by the baggage column of his own army. He deployed his army on the left bank of the river, creating a double line with the cavalry and artillery in one row and the infantry in a second row behind them. Sighting the French positions, Egmont placed his troops in a crescent, with the light cavalry on the flanks and the Spanish troops, together with the German and Flemish units, in the center. The French used their artillery, and a chaotic battle was fought between the cavalry of both sides. The Spanish arquebusiers, who were better armed and trained, peppered the French cavalry. They then shot at the infantry sheltered behind the baggage train, creating great confusion among the French ranks. Egmont, at the head of his horsemen, decided to attack the French center with his cavalry. Biscay and English ships bombarded the French rear, causing numerous casualties. The outcome of the battle could not have been worse for the French: only 1,500 men had managed to flee; the rest lay dead or were taken prisoner. The lord of Thermes was taken prisoner. The French were forced to retreat to the border. This defeat, coupled with the loss at the Battle of St. Quentin (1557), forced Henry II of France to make peace with Philip II in the Peace of Cateau-Cambresis of 1559. It was because of this treaty that Philip II married Elisabeth of Valois, daughter of Henry, while Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy married Margaret of France, Duchess of Berry, sister of Henry and daughter of King Francis I of France.

Kanter (born February 25, 1948) is a former politician in Ontario, Canada. He served in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as a Liberal from 1987 to 1990. Background Kanter was educated at Glendon College, York University, the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, and Osgoode Hall Law School. He was called to the Bar in 1976. In 1984, he was named a course director at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. Kanter served as special assistant to Ontario Liberal Party leader Stuart Smith from 1976 to 1980. Politics He served as an alderman on the Toronto City Council from 1980 to 1987, and was also a member of the Metro Toronto council from 1985 to 1987. He was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, upsetting Progressive Conservative leader and longtime MPP Larry Grossman by 3,676 votes in the constituency of St. Andrew‚ÄîSt. Patrick. Shortly after the election he was appointed as Parliamentary Assistant to Solicitor General Joan Smith in David Peterson's government. In July 1989, Kanter was implicated in the Patti Starr affair. Starr, who was head of the National Council of Jewish Women, misused her position by having the organization make political contributions to the riding associations of prominent Liberal MPPs. Kanter's riding of St. Andrew-St. Patrick was among those who received these illegal contributions.Matt Maychak. Liberal links to fallen Starr scares MPPs. Toronto Star. June 15, 1989. pg A30.

Toronto Star. August 2, 1989. pp. A1, A27. The Liberals were defeated by the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1990 provincial election. Kanter's connection to the tainted Starr scandal was mentioned as one of the reasons that he finished third in his bid for re-election, 1,383 votes behind winner Zanana Akande of the NDP. Later life Kanter now practises regulatory law with the firm of Macdonald Sager Manis LLP. He serves on the Toronto Board of Trade Task Force, and writes and speaks frequently on municipal government and planning issues. In July 1990, he authored a publication entitled \\"Space for all: options for a Greater Toronto Area greenlands strategy\\".

Chrysler Museum was a car museum in Auburn Hills, Michigan, featuring historically significant vehicles designed and manufactured by Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep, AMC, Nash, Hudson, and Rambler. It was in operation from October 1999 through December 2012, with a brief re-opening in 2016 before closing permanently in December 2016. The museum was named after Walter P. Chrysler, the founder of Chrysler Corporation. Design Designed by Giffels Associates and occupying 10 acres adjacent the southeast edge of Chrysler's North American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan, the museum had three levels with about 55,000 square feet of exhibition space, its polished red granite and black glass exterior correlating to the nearby Chrysler Headquarters and Technology Center. Groundbreaking took place on November 19, 1996, and the museum opened on October 5, 1999. The building featured 65 antique, custom and concept vehicles along with interactive displays and historical exhibits depicting Chrysler's design, technology and innovation, and the cultural impact of the automobile. A two-story atrium featured a prominent rotating tower, mounted with platforms suspending concept vehicles. The atrium gave access to two floors of exhibition galleries and a more straightforward lower level, which traced the first 50 years of the automotive industry, focusing on Walter P. Chrysler and his company. A number of rare vehicles from the early 1900s were featured. A timeline wall detailed the roles of individuals and legacy companies, including DeSoto, Hudson, Nash, Plymouth, Rambler and Willys-Overland. The second floor featured the first Chrysler Hemi from 1951, as well as displays about vehicle styling, electronics, turbine technology, safety and fuel economy. The garage-like lower level held vehicles from the 1960s and 1970s, plus a series of Jeep¬Æ vehicles and trucks.

Built as a turnpike, the Dorchester Turnpike, it is mostly straight. History The Boston South Bridge over Fort Point Channel, on the site of today's West Fourth Street Bridge, opened on October 1, 1805 as the first bridge connecting downtown to South Boston. Until it was sold to the city of Boston on April 19, 1832, it was a toll bridge. The Dorchester Turnpike Corporation (sometimes called the South Boston Turnpike) was created by the state legislature on March 4, 1805, to build a turnpike from the east end of the Boston South Bridge (Nook Point) to Milton Bridge over the Neponset River, on the other side of which the Blue Hill Turnpike later continued. Construction cost more than expected, and thus high tolls were charged, so many travelers took the old longer route through Roxbury. Despite that, the Dorchester Turnpike was one of the most profitable turnpikes, with earnings steadily climbing to a peak in 1838. When the parallel Old Colony Railroad opened in 1844, earnings quickly fell. The North Free Bridge, on the site of today's Dorchester Avenue Bridge, opened in 1826, providing a more direct route form the north end of the turnpike to Dewey Square downtown. On April 22, 1854, the turnpike became a free public road, named Dorchester Avenue. The name was changed to Federal Street in 1856, as it provided a continuation of that street from downtown Boston (via the North Free Bridge), but it became Dorchester Avenue again in 1870. As part of the building of South Station (opened 1899), Federal Street was cut between the bridge and Dewey Square. Dorchester Avenue was extended north from the bridge around the east side of the new union station, along the shore of the Fort Point Channel, intersecting Mount Washington Avenue (which was also cut by the new station) and Summer Street and ending at Congress Street. Additionally, the Atlantic Avenue Viaduct was built as a second bridge just west of the Dorchester Avenue Bridge, connecting to Atlantic Avenue at Dewey Square. By 1923 the viaduct was gone, but the extension of Dorchester Avenue remains to this day. In the 1990s it was closed to the public, including pedestrians and bicyclists, from the bridge to Summer Street, due to its proximity to Big Dig construction. It has remained closed due to security concerns, as it runs next to the South Postal Annex (a sorting facility of the United States Postal Service). Public transportation The Dorchester Avenue Railroad, one of the first street railways in Boston, started operations in 1857, eventually running over the full length (from downtown to the Neponset River). When the road was realigned around 1899, the tracks were moved, ending at a line along Summer Street. As the Red Line opened in the 1910s and 1920s, parallel to Dorchester Avenue, most through passengers switched to that, and local routes were rerouted to feed into the new subway. Tracks were removed by the 1950s. Today the Red Line Ashmont branch is sometimes referred to as the Dorchester Avenue line. Nowadays the only bus routes to use the road are local routes to subway stations: :Note: routes that use Dorchester Avenue for only a few blocks are not listed. * 18 Ashmont--Andrew via Dorchester Avenue * 27 Mattapan--Ashmont via River Street and Dorchester Avenue * 217 Wollaston Beach --Ashmont via Adams, East Milton Square and Beale Street * 240 Ashmont--Avon Square via Crawford Square Randolph Numbered routes The first numbered routes in New England were the New England Interstate Highways in 1922. NE 6 may have used Dorchester Avenue south of South Boston, but it is more likely that it turned northwest towards Morton Street just after crossing the Neponset River. In any case, by 1927, Route 3 (which had replaced NE 6) and Route 28 turned northwest in Milton, on a route that Route 28 still uses. (By 1928, Route 3 had been realigned to use the new Southern Artery, now Gallivan Boulevard.) 100pxBetween 1933 and 1935, the C (city) routes through downtown Boston began to be signed. Route C37, a continuation of Route 37, used MDC Parkways (now Morrissey Boulevard), merging with Dorchester Avenue at Old Colony Avenue. From there C37 took Dorchester Avenue to its north end, Congress Street, turning northwest there into downtown. A one-way pair existed from West Fourth Street to the Fort Point Channel, with southbound traffic using Foundry Street and West Fourth Street, but this was later removed, with Dorchester Avenue returning to full two-way operation. In the 1970s, C37 (and the rest of the C routes) was decommissioned, leaving Dorchester Avenue with no numbered routes. Thus, over the years, the only route to use the road has probably been C37.

C‚ÄìTe‚ÄìC angles tend to be closer to 90¬∞.Reid, G., et al. Journal of Organometallic Chemistry, 642 (2002) 186‚Äì 190. Inorganic tellurides Many metal tellurides are known, including some telluride minerals. These include natural gold tellurides, like calaverite and krennerite (AuTe2), and sylvanite (AgAuTe4). They are minor ores of gold, although they comprise the major naturally occurring compounds of gold. (A few other natural compounds of gold, such as the bismuthide maldonite (Au2Bi) and antimonide aurostibite (AuSb2), are known). Although the bonding in such materials is often fairly covalent, they are described casually as salts of Te2‚àí. Using this approach, Ag2Te is derived from Ag+ and Te2‚àí. Applications Tellurides have no large scale applications. Cadmium telluride has attractive photovoltaic properties. Both bismuth telluride and lead telluride are exceptional thermoelectric materials. Some of these thermolectric materials have been commercialized.

Since December 16, 2004 the airport is also named after the Minas Gerais-born poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade (1902‚Äì1987). The airport is operated by Infraero. History Pampulha Airport was opened in 1933 as a support facility for the passenger flights operated by the Brazilian Air Force between Rio de Janeiro and Fortaleza. The first commercial operation started in 1936, when Panair do Brasil was granted a concession to fly between Rio de Janeiro and Belo Horizonte. In 1943 the runway was extended to 1,500m x 45m, in 1953 to 1,700m, and finally in 1961 to 2,505m. Since 1973 the airport has been operated by Infraero. With the great increase of traffic at Pampulha Airport, the facility became too small and unable to handle all operations. For this reason, the new Tancredo Neves International Airport was built in the adjoining municipality of Confins. The new facility was opened in 1984. However, due to the long distance between Belo Horizonte and Confins, Pampulha remained the airport of choice for most airlines, eventually becoming overcrowded, while Confins was under-used. In order to revert this scenario, in March 2005 the government of the state of Minas Gerais with the support of agencies of the Federal government decided to restrict Pampulha to operations of aircraft with capacity of up to 50 passengers. In the months thereafter, most operations were forced to move to Confins and Pampulha gained a new vocation as a hub for regional flights and general aviation. On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a BRL8.4 million (USD4.4 million; EUR3.1 million) investment plan to upgrade Pampulha Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Brazil, Belo Horizonte being one of the venue cities. The investment was used to: build a new control tower, upgrade general aviation hangars, and enlarge the apron. On June 17, 2020, the Federal Government signed an agreement to transfer the administration of the airport to the Government of the State of Minas Gerais. The transition period will end on December 31, 2020. Airlines and destinations No scheduled flights operate at this airport.

It can be used encouragingly or to compliment, as in \\"You son of a gun, you did it!\\" Definition The Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary and Webster's Dictionary both define \\"son of a gun\\" in American English as a euphemism for son of a bitch. Encarta Dictionary defines the term in a different way as someone \\"affectionately or kindly regarded.\\" The term can also be used as an interjection expressing surprise, mild annoyance or disappointment. Etymology The phrase is found in a piece of comic verse from 1726: A 1787 correspondent to The Gentleman's Magazine suggested that the phrase originally meant \\"a soldier's brat\\". A 19th-century gun deck (HMS Victory). The phrase potentially has its origin in a Royal Navy direction that pregnant women aboard smaller naval vessels give birth in the space between the broadside guns, in order to keep the gangways and crew decks clear. Admiral William Henry Smyth wrote in his 1867 book, The Sailor's Word-Book: \\"Son of a gun, an epithet conveying contempt in a slight degree, and originally applied to boys born afloat, when women were permitted to accompany their husbands to sea; one admiral declared he literally was thus cradled, under the breast of a gun- carriage.\\" Alternatively, historian Brian Downing proposes that the phrase \\"son of a gun\\" originated from feudal knights' disdain for newly developed firearms and those who wielded them. An American urban myth also proposes that the saying originated in a story reported in the October 7, 1864 The American Medical Weekly about a woman impregnated by a bullet that went through a soldier's testicles and into her womb. The story about the woman was a joke written by Dr. Legrand G. Capers; some people who read the weekly failed to realize that the story was a joke and reported it as true. This myth was the subject of an episode of the television show MythBusters, in which experiments showed the story implausible.

She first appeared in Kingdom Come #3 (July 1996). Publication history Iris West II/Kid Flash appears in issues 3 and 4 of the 1996 Kingdom Come mini-series. She subsequently appears in the Kingdom Come sequel, The Kingdom, starring in her own issue The Kingdom: Kid Flash (February 1999). Characters similar to this one appear in The Flash #143 (December 1998) and #146‚Äì149 (March‚ÄìJune 1999), as well as The Titans #23‚Äì25 (January‚ÄìMarch 2001); however, it is not clear if they are the same character. Fictional character biography=Kingdom Come In the alternate future of the Kingdom Come series, Iris West II is the daughter of Wally West (the first Kid Flash, third Flash) and Linda Park, and the twin sister of Barry West. Both Iris and Barry inherited their father's superspeed abilities, but only Iris chose to use her powers for good, while Barry used his powers to become a slacker and has no interest in the \\"family legacy\\". Iris is constantly bitter that her father, who has almost completely given up his life to patrol Keystone City non-stop, never makes time for her but does make time for Barry, and considered him the potential successor to the Flash identity instead of Iris, despite her becoming Kid Flash. In the sequel The Kingdom, Iris is recruited by Rip Hunter (along with several other heroes of her generation - Ibn al Xu'ffasch, Batman's son; Nightstar, the daughter of Nightwing and Starfire; and Offspring, the son of Plastic Man) to try to stop a madman named Gog from altering the past, before discovering it to be unnecessary due to Hypertime. In The Titans #23‚Äì25 she becomes a member of a group comprising the children of the original five Titans: herself; Nightwing and Starfire's daughter Nightstar; Donna Troy's son Darkstar; the Red Hood, Arsenal's daughter; and Tula, Tempest's daughter. They return to the present in various Hypertimelines to save the existence of Donna Troy. In the Dark Nights: Death Metal - Multiverse's End one-shot, Kid Flash is one of the heroes John Stewart leads on a mission to destroy Perpetua's tuning fork on Earth-3. DC Universe In Flash #225 (October 2005), Wally West's wife Linda gave birth to a daughter named Iris. Initially, her only power is the ability to vibrate through objects. In Flash #240 (May 2008) Iris appears to grow into a teenager wearing a costume similar to her future counterpart. In issue 241, Iris now wearing a \\"kid flash\\"-like costume displays superspeed and states she may be faster than her father. However her joy is short-lived, as she ages into adulthood after defeating Gorilla Grodd. In Flash #243, Iris is returned to her original age, and her powers revert to molecular acceleration. More than her twin brother Jai, Iris is a living conduit for the Speed Force, with absolute mastery over it almost rivaling the one briefly gained by her father during the Dark Flash Saga. Mind-controlled by Queen Bee, she exhibited the power of forming \\"cocoons\\" of Speed Force, bubbles in which she could control speed and time, freezing her targets or hastening their metabolism to death. Moreover, she repaired the weakening connection to the Speed Force that was crippling her father. Badly traumatized by her ordeal, she refuses to give in to her powers again.Flash #247. DC Comics. Her resolution wanes with the return of the first Reverse-Flash, Professor Zoom, during The Flash: Rebirth event. Since Jai's and Iris' connection to the Speed Force is still precarious, the attempts of Zoom to disrupt it force both kids to endure a large amount of crippling pain, until Iris decides to take the bulk of the Speed Power connection, freeing Jai but taking the pain for herself. At the last moment Jesse Chambers, guided by the late Johnny Quick, uses the Speed Mantra to save Iris' life, once again restoring her full potential. Iris embraces her new role with childlike glee, choosing to take up the mantle of Impulse, which Bart used before he joined the Teen Titans as Kid Flash.Flash: Rebirth #5 Impulse is later shown being recorded on Flyover, a social networking feature devised to help villains stalk and kill teen superheroes.Supergirl (vol. 5) #60. DC Comics. =DC Rebirth (2016-)= Iris and her brother Jai were absent from history due to the manipulations of Doctor Manhattan following Flashpoint. When Wally West returned in DC Rebirth #1 it was revealed that his wife, Linda Park, does not remember Wally, leaving the fate of Jai and Iris unknown at best. In Flash War #1 it was revealed by Hunter Zolomon to Wally that his forgotten children (and implied Bart Allen, Max Mercury, and Jesse Quick) not only existed in the altered timeline but are currently trapped in the speed force like he was. In the following issue Zoom urges a heartbroken Wally to break the speed force enough to save his family, leading to an altercation between Wally and Barry whether or not to rescue his children at risk of damaging the speed force and time once again.DC Rebirth (2016) #1. DC Comics.Flash (2016-) #48. DC Comics. Unfortunately for Wally, Zoom lied. Rather than breaking the Speed Force, the attempt broke the \\"Force Barrier\\", which unlocked hidden other forces related to the Speed Force, called the Sage and Strength Forces. Taking the power of these new forces to defeat the Justice League and the Titans, Zoom then claims that he does indeed know where the rest of the Flash family is, but Zoom withholds this information, and proceeds to claim the mantle of Flash before attacking Wally and Barry. Flash (2016-) #49. DC Comics. Iris and Jai next make brief appearances in flashbacks and simulations regarding Wally while he attempted to recover at Sanctuary during \\"Heroes in Crisis\\". Iris (in her Impulse costume) and Jai are finally revealed to exist in the DC Rebirth universe, stranded on the problematic undying planet in the ever encroaching Dark Multiverse that is seemingly connected to Wally and his actions in \\"Heroes in Crisis\\". She and Jai were emigrated to Earth 0 by Wally.Flash Forward (2019-) #2-6. DC Comics. Powers and abilities Iris West II has the same abilities as her father Wally West: superspeed, the ability to control and vibrate her molecules, and an aura that protects her from friction at high velocities.

He started playing professionally at 17, in 1973, with Newcastle United. Fans nicknamed him Rocky and he stayed with the Football League First Division side for four years before moving to the U.S. and playing with various teams for about 15 years. When he finished his playing career, he started coaching. He was named the head coach in the middle of the 2000 season of the Miami Fusion and was then hired by D.C. United on 8 January 2002 to be their head coach. He was replaced in 2004. Hudson then began commentating for GolTV. In 2012, he joined Sirius XM Radio as the morning show host of The Football Show on SiriusXM FC 157, SiriusXM's all soccer channel. Playing career Hudson signed with Newcastle United in 1973 at the age of 17, from local team Whickham Juniors. He made 25 appearances for Newcastle and fans there nicknamed him \\"Rocky.\\" After four years in the Football League First Division, Hudson moved to the United States, playing for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League from 1977 to 1983. His former teammate at Newcastle, Paul Cannell, who like Hudson had struggled to get a first team place, in his book Fuckin' Hell It's Paul Cannell, claimed he was one of the people responsible for getting Hudson to play his football in America. Cannell had spell on loan at the Washington Diplomats in the 1970s. When Cannell came back to Newcastle, Hudson, was keen to know what life and playing football was like in the US. Cannell claimed he gave Hudson tales of sex, drugs, rock and roll and football and the rest is history... In the next season Cannell played against Fort Lauderdale Strikers, a team full of world class players, and he explained Hudson was by far the best player on the pitch... Hudson played the winter season of 1983‚Äì84 in Germany with Union Solingen, making 10 appearances without scoring.Ray Hudson ‚Äì Fussballdaten ‚Äì Die Fu√üball-Datenbank Hudson also played for the Strikers following their move to Minnesota in 1984, which proved to be the league's final year. Over the course of his eight years in NASL, Hudson scored 44 goals in 197 matches with 99 assists, and was named to five All-NASL squads, including once as a Best XI in 1984.https://web.archive.org/web/20090503095238/http://home.att.net/~nasl/all- stars.htm He followed this with a season playing for Edmonton Brickmen before joining the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Soccer League. After a knee injury sidelined him, the Strikers released him. He spent one season (1990) playing for cross-state rivals Tampa Bayhttp://articles.sun- sentinel.com/1990-02-15/sports/9001240666_1_ray-hudson-tampa-bay-rowdies-fort- lauderdale-strikershttp://mytampabayrowdies.blogspot.com/2009/11/1977-rowdies- kick- magazine.htmlhttp://mytampabayrowdies.blogspot.com/2012_04_01_archive.html before returning to the Strikers in 1991. By this time the team was playing in the American Professional Soccer League. He was released by the Strikers when the club was mired in a four-match scoreless streak to begin the season. In 1992, he injured his other knee while playing in an NASL reunion match between NASL-era Strikers and Rowdies.http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/1992-08-18/sports/9201160346_1_strikers-ray-hudson-reunion-game Coaching After starting out as the Miami Fusion's community outreach director and TV commentator, Hudson was named its head coach in the middle of the 2000 season, finishing the season with an 11‚Äì1‚Äì12 record. He led the club to the best regular season record in Major League Soccer (the MLS Supporters' Shield) in 2001 with 16 wins, 5 draws, and 5 losses. However, the club was defeated by the San Jose Earthquakes in the semifinal round of the playoffs. Hudson quickly became known for his fiery personality. One memorable incident occurred after a Miami home win against the Tampa Bay Mutiny. The Fusion scored five goals, usually considered an excellent performance, but Hudson was apparently unsatisfied. He stormed into the media tent and up to the podium. He said, \\"I've got nothing to say. Any questions? ANY QUESTIONS? No? OK!\\" and stormed right back out. Interviews with players after the game indicated that Hudson was angered by a perceived lack of effort, even with the Fusion's dominant win. Following MLS's contraction of the Fusion, Hudson was hired to replace Thomas Rongen as head coach of D.C. United on 8 January 2002. He continued to regale fans and journalists with his wit, stories, and quotes. He said, \\"There's a lot of talent on this team, and I'm talking Anna Nicole Smith type of talent!\\" upon taking control of the team in 2002. D.C. United finished at the bottom of the table in the East in 2002 with a record of 9‚Äì5‚Äì14, and were ousted in the first round by Chicago Fire by a 4‚Äì0 aggregate score in the two-game series in 2003. \\"Someone get me a blindfold and a cigarette!\\" he said during the post-game news conference. He was replaced by Piotr Nowak in 2004. Hudson's cumulative record as an MLS head coach stands at 46‚Äì20‚Äì44. Commentating He worked for ESPN's World Cup coverage in 2002, and came up with a memorable quote after the United States drew 1‚Äì1 with South Korea in group play. Expounding upon whether U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel should be thanking his defenders for their work, he said, \\"I'll be kissing their bums in the showers.\\" Beginning with the 2004‚Äì2005 season, Hudson began commentating for GolTV. He was a co-commentator for European league matches and a co-host of American Soccer until his final appearance on the show on 29 August 2007. During the 2006 World Cup, he was a co-host for the English-language segment of the nightly Gol TV En Alemania wrap-up show. In 2012, Hudson joined Sirius XM Radio as lead commentator on SiriusXM FC 85, the service's soccer channel. Hudson hosts The Football Show with Charlie Stillitano, Neil Barnett, and Phil Schoen, which airs weekdays at 7am Eastern Time. His listeners refer to him as 'Rocky' which was his nickname back in his playing days. He is the centerpiece of Hudson's Howlers, a monthly feature highlighting his most outrageous comments. Hudson's commentating style, which mimics fellow Geordie, famous darts commentator Sid Waddell, consists of metaphors and excited, romanticized descriptions (e.g., \\"magisteeerial\\") of players and goals, has earned him both praise and ridicule. In March 2020, it was announced that Hudson will serve as play-by-play commentator for Inter Miami CF of Major League Soccer.

Some scholars have argued that it was actually section 24 that ensured that the Charter would not have the primary flaw of the 1960 Canadian Bill of Rights. Canadian judges would be reassured that that they could indeed strike down statutes on the basis that they contradicted a bill of rights.Dyck, Rand. Canadian Politics: Critical Approaches. Third ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Nelson Thomson Learning, 2000), p. 442. Text Under the heading \\"Enforcement,\\" the section states: Remedies Subsection 24(1) must be distinguished from subsection 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982. Whereas section 52 allows the courts to invalidate laws or parts of laws for breaches of the constitution (including the Charter), section 24 has broader capabilities (hindered only by the \\"appropriate and just\\" requirement) and can only be invoked when a claimant's rights are violated. Among other things, section 24 seems to give judges the power to place positive obligations upon a government,Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. (Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003), pp. 864-865. as well as to enforce more imaginative remedies. An example of an imaginative remedy can be found in the landmark case Doucet-Boudreau, (2003) 3 S.C.R. 3, as the claimants challenged the Nova Scotia government's delay in building French language schools as a breach of their section 23 rights. A lower-court judge had ruled in the claimants' favour, and then demanded the government report to him as construction progressed. Despite the Supreme Court minority's objections that this use of section 24 violated \\"fundamental justice\\" and the \\"functus officio\\" rule, in which a judge makes a ruling and afterwards has no role to play, the majority upheld the earlier decision. As the majority argued, section 24 is \\"responsive to the needs of a given case,\\" and as such \\"novel remedies\\" may not only be permissible, but also required. The \\"appropriate and just\\" limit was defined in this case as giving the courts themselves the right to determine what is appropriate and just (although they should keep in mind traditional common law limits on judicial power; in this case it was denied that functus officio was violated), and also as requiring courts to remember that section 24 is itself a part of the constitution and allows judges to carry out their function of enforcing rights.Supreme Court of Canada. Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education), (2003) 3 S.C.R. 3. Courts of competent jurisdiction These section 24(1) remedies may only be dispensed by a \\"court of competent jurisdiction\\". In R. v. Rahey (1987), it was found that in any case, provincial superior and appellate courts, and courts created by the federal government, will qualify as a court of competent jurisdiction and may award remedies where it is considered \\"appropriate and just\\". An inferior provincial court may qualify as a court of competent jurisdiction where the remedy sought relates to trial procedure. An administrative tribunal may qualify as a court of competent jurisdiction where it has been granted statutory jurisdiction over the parties, subject matter, and remedy sought.Weber v. Ontario Hydro (1995) It is important to note that the jurisdiction over \\"remedy sought\\" means the jurisdiction as granted by statute, irrespective of the total remedies available under section 24(1) that may be applied by other courts. Even where a tribunal is not found to be a court of competent jurisdiction it is still nonetheless capable of applying the Charter. Where a tribunal has been given the power to decide questions of lawsee N.S. v. Martin; N.S. v. Laseur (2003) for the Charter jurisdiction test it must conform to the Constitution in all of its application of law and so invalid laws must be treated as having no force or effect.Douglas/Kwantlen Faculty Association v. Douglas College (1990), see also Cuddy Chicks v. Ontario (1991) However, even if the tribunal is a court of competent jurisdiction it cannot make a declaration of invalidity for any invalid law, it can only treat it as no force or effect.ibid. Overall, section 24's \\"competent jurisdiction\\" limit on which courts may award remedies, in R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc. (2001), was taken as meaning that while Charter rights are generous, they exist within a framework set up by Parliament and the provincial governments. These elected governments have the authority to grant varying degrees of powers to courts and tribunals, and deference should be shown to the governments' decisions. Reviewing courts may, however, have to exercise interpretation regarding whether lower courts have powers to award certain remedies if it is not explicit in the laws. This involves examining whether the lower court can consider Charter arguments and if allowing the lower court to dispense section 24(1) remedies would disrupt its general operations or be too much of a work burden for the court staff. Exclusion of evidence Practices regarding what evidence may be brought against an individual in trials are addressed by section 24(2). When evidence is obtained through the violation of a Charter right, the claimant is able to apply to have the evidence excluded from the trial under this section. At common law, all evidence, regardless of how it was obtained, can be submitted in a trial.R. v. Wray (1970), 4 C.C.C. 1, 11 C.R.N.S. 235, [1971] S.C.R. 272. The US exclusionary rule excludes all evidence acquired through the violation of the Bill of Rights. Canada has taken a middle ground, sometimes allowing for the exclusion of evidence, whenever its use threatens to bring the \\"administration of justice\\" into \\"disrepute.\\" In the 2009 case R. v. Grant, the Supreme Court of Canada created a new test to determine when the administration of justice has been brought into disrepute (replacing the 1987 test in R. v. Collins). The Grant test lists three factors the courts must consider: (1) the seriousness of the Charter-infringing conduct (focusing on a review of how society would view the actions of the state), (2) the impact of the breach on the Charter-protected interests of the accused (focusing on a review of how the state's actions affected the accused), and (3) society's interests in the adjudication of the case on its merits (focusing on a review of the importance and reliability of the evidence). Past interpretations The 1987 case R. v. Collins had established three factors to consider when determining whether to exclude evidence. First, the courts would look at whether the admission of the evidence would affect the fairness of the trial. Second, they would look at the seriousness of the Charter violation, and third, they would look at the effect of excluding the evidence on the administration of justice. Typically, evidence obtained through violating an accused's right to have counsel (section 10(b)) or the right to security from unreasonable search and seizure (section 8) was excluded by this section. After Collins and other such decisions, by 2000 the Supreme Court of Canada had used the Charter to exclude evidence in 45% of section 24(2) cases that come before the Court.Morton, FL and Ranier Knopff.

It developed as a port around the mouth of the river of the same name. Today the city is a centre of environmental tourism and a gateway to the Treasure Beach resort area. Treasure Beach and Crane Beach are to the south-east, with Luana Beach to the west. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, it was a thriving sugar port with a market for African slaves. Growing prosperity in the sugar and lumber trade led to the construction of several warehouses. Some have been adapted as restaurants or as bases for eco-tours of the river. History Jamaican telegraph stamp used at Black River in 1900. Black River is one of the oldest European towns in the island of Jamaica, being shown on John Sellers' 1685 map. It was designed by the Leyden brothers of England, three wealthy men who were substantial land proprietors in the area. In 1773 Black River replaced Lacovia, 19 miles to the north-east, as the capital of St. Elizabeth. Soon after it became the main commercial, economic and transshipment centre of the parish. By the early 1900s, it was second only to Kingston in economic importance on the island. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Black River was a busy seaport for the lucrative logwood trade and for exports of rum, pimento and cattle skins from the nearby Holland, Vineyard, and Fullerswood plantations. The Logwood tree trunks were floated down the Black River to the port to be shipped to England for making of dyes. Into the early 19th century, slaves from Africa and other Caribbean islands were landed here and sold at auction at Farquharson Wharf (originally Town Wharf). This wharf still stands. In 2007, the United Kingdom celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Slave Trade Act 1807, which ended the African slave trade in its colonies. A monument was installed at Black River in 2007 to memorialize the slaves killed in the Zong massacre of 1781. More than 132 slaves were thrown overboard at sea from the Zong. They were sacrificed by the crew purportedly to save the remainder and the crew because of a shortage of water on board.\\"The Zong case study\\", Understanding Slavery Initiative website, 2011 The Zong finally landed at Black River. Its owners later sued for insurance claims for the slaves who had been killed, and the case was litigated in 1783 in Britain. The court rejected the owners' claim, as it was shown that the crew had made navigation errors that kept the ship at sea and threatened its supplies. Abolitionists publicized it, and the case became a catalyst for continuing efforts to abolish slavery. Britain abolished slavery in its empire (except for India, where it was endemic as part of the culture) in 1833. As a major sea port, Black River became a commercial center on the south coast of Jamaica. Due to its wealth, in 1893 this was the first town in Jamaica to be lit by electricity. Ten years later, in 1903 it was the first city on the island to have automobiles. A telephone system was installed 10 years after the instrument was invented. ReferencesExternal links * Aerial view.

Produced by the Weintraub Entertainment Group and directed by Jeff Kanew, starring Shelley Long, Craig T. Nelson, Betty Thomas, Mary Gross, Stephanie Beacham and introducing Jenny Lewis as Hannah Nefler. The film features a host of young actors, including Tori Spelling, Carla Gugino, Emily Schulman, Ami Foster, and Kellie Martin. Plot Phyllis Nefler is a socialite wife recently separated from her husband Freddy, a wealthy owner of an auto shop chain. In an attempt to maintain the relationship with her daughter Hannah during the contentious divorce, Phyllis becomes the den mother of Hannah's unruly, leaderless local girl scout troop of Wilderness Girls. Their first campout results in the troop getting caught in a rain squall, prompting Phyllis to take the girls to 'camp out' at the Beverly Hills Hotel. Despite her unorthodox ways, Phyllis demonstrates an unwavering commitment to the girls' well-being and ends up becoming a surrogate mother to the rest of the girls in the troop. Although Phyllis lacks the skills found in most troop leaders, due to a lack of interest in anything found in the 'wilderness', she resolves to teach the girls how to survive in \\"the wilds of Beverly Hills,\\" even customizing new merit badges for her troop. Phyllis's unorthodox methods run afoul of another scout leader, Velda Plendor, a mean-spirited, retired army nurse who runs the Culver City \\"Red Feathers\\" in which her own daughter, Cleo, is a member. Because Velda has considerable pull at the regional council level, she declares Phyllis's customized merit badges ineligible and sends her assistant troop leader, Annie Herman, to infiltrate Troop Beverly Hills and sabotage them. She repeatedly tries to get the troop disbanded and Phyllis fired, but her boss, Frances Temple, doesn't go along with it. All Velda and Annie's spying has done is show Frances that Phyllis may be unusual, but she has taken an active interest in these girls and is trying to help them learn to survive their personal environment rather than the wilderness. Troop Beverly Hills can gain recognition from the regional council by passing a series of tests at an upcoming Jamboree. In order to qualify, the troop needs to sell 1,000 boxes of cookies. To prevent this, Velda one-ups Troop Beverly Hills by selling cookies in their own neighborhood. Seeing this, Annie sides with Phyllis and offers her abilities and insider knowledge to the girls. Despite her unusual nature, Phyllis is beginning to learn at this point; for example, when her Hollywood friends ask her if they should solve the problem by buying the cookies, Phyllis points out that them doing that misses the entire point about building community‚Äîthey may well end up going the glamour route to sell the cookies, but it's still a legitimate attempt to do it meaningfully, at least for Beverly Hills. In fact, their star-studded sales drive sells over 4,000 boxes, more than enough to qualify for the Jamboree. Phyllis invites Velda to a party so that she may receive a check for the earnings. At the party, Velda takes her anger out on Annie and demands that she obey her or go work at Kmart. Annie snaps back, standing up to her superior for the first time. Meanwhile, Phyllis, dressed in a beautiful pink and blue dress, reconnects with her husband Freddy for the first time. They speak to each other while dancing and Freddy tells her he‚Äôs proud that she‚Äôs accomplished something. A few moments later, Phyllis learns that Freddy wants to proceed with the divorce, including seeking joint custody of Hannah. Phyllis is devastated and falls into a swimming pool spectacularly. The morning after the party, Velda talks Phyllis out of attending the Jamboree, warning that it is 100 miles from the nearest 4-star hotel and that she will be responsible if anyone gets hurt. Phyllis sinks into a deep depression and decides to disband the troop, but Hannah and the other girls talk her out of it, Tessa commenting that she gave them a new sense of self-esteem, which is translated as \\"That you made us like ourselves.\\" During the Jamboree, the Red Feathers trick Troop Beverly Hills during competition by misdirecting them into a snake-infested swamp. In a stroke of good luck, a skunk scares them into running through a shortcut, making them first in the qualifying event.The next day, Velda cheats again by cutting a rope bridge after her troop crosses and by leading them into a restricted area used only for hunting. In a stroke of bad luck, she breaks her ankle after falling into a hole. The Red Feathers, led now by Velda's daughter Cleo, leave her behind for the sake of winning. Troop Beverly Hills repairs the bridge and finds Velda and diagnoses her with a broken ankle and a severe personality disorder. The girls reluctantly carry her to the finish line after Phyllis reminds them that they have to be considerate to those in need - especially a fellow wilderness explorer. Though the Red Feathers cross the finish line first, they're disqualified because council law stipulates the leader must be with the troop. Troop Beverly Hills is declared the winners of the Jamboree and are validated as Wilderness Girls. Frances Temple, the regional leader, fires Velda for cheating and for putting the Troop Beverly Hills girls in jeopardy. Freddy, intrigued by Phyllis's complete turnaround, is interested in calling off the divorce. After working through their issues with one another, they get back together. The next year, Troop Beverly Hills is the designated Poster Troop, and it is Velda who ends up forced to take the job at Kmart after her actions at the Jamboree made her virtually unemployable.

Its dramaturgical structure, like that of his earlier Sturm und Drang play G√∂tz von Berlichingen (1773), is heavily influenced by Shakespearean tragedy. In contrast to the earlier work, the portrait in Egmont of the downfall of a man who trusts in the goodness of those around him appears to mark a shift away from Sturm und Drang values. Plot In Egmont, Goethe relates the fight of Count Egmont (1522‚Äì1568) in the Eighty Years' War against the despotic Duke of Alba. Egmont is a famous Dutch warrior and the Duke of Alba represents the Spanish invader. Though under threat of arrest, Egmont refuses to run away and give up his ideal of liberty. Imprisoned and abandoned because of the cowardice of his people, and despite the desperate efforts of his mistress Kl√§rchen, he is sentenced to death. Thus, faced with her failure and despair, Kl√§rchen puts an end to her life. The play ends on the hero's last call to fight for independence. His death as a martyr appears as a victory against oppression. Egmont is a political manifesto in which Egmont's craving for justice and national liberty is opposed to the despotic authority of the Duke of Alba. It is also a drama of destiny in which the Flemish nobleman, with fatalism, accepts the dire consequences of his straightforwardness and honesty. Quotation The phrase \\"Himmelhoch jauchzend, zu(m) Tode betr√ºbt\\" (heavenly joy, deadly sorrow) from Kl√§rchen's song in the third act has become a proverb often quoted by European intellectuals as characteristic of the Romantic soul: Freudvoll und leidvoll, gedankenvoll sein; Langen und bangen in schwebender Pein; Himmelhoch jauchzend, zum Tode betr√ºbt; Gl√ºcklich allein ist die Seele, die liebt. In joy and in sorrow, be thoughtful; Long and fearful in suspended pain; Rejoicing to heaven, grieving to death; Blessed alone is the soul that loves. Music When in 1809 the Burgtheater asked Ludwig van Beethoven, a great admirer of Goethe, to compose incidental music for a revival of the play, he accepted with enthusiasm. It recalled themes close to his own political preoccupations, already expressed in his opera Leonore (renamed Fidelio in the definitive 1814 version) and in his Coriolan Overture (in 1807). Besides the Overture, he wrote nine pieces of incidental music, of great quality but a little disconnected, culminating with the beautiful Kl√§rchen's Death. Though the other pieces in the incidental music are seldom played, Beethoven's overture to Egmont is a staple of the concert repertoire. It has been used in various modern-day cultural output, a famous United Nations film being one of them. The overture was played at the memorial service commemorating the kidnapping and murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Summer Olympics.  Cultural influences  The Short Film Palme d'Or- winning Hungarian film Overture by J√°nos Vad√°sz uses Beethoven's Egmont Overture as the soundtrack for a series of images, featuring a hatching bird, referencing the rebellious nature of Egmont fighting for freedom despite all barriers. The film, nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) has been described as one of the most influential short films in film history. The reviewer said it was \\"among the most ingenious pairings of music and image in the history of the festival.\\"http://www.film.com/movies/best-cannes-short-films NotesReferences * External links * English translation of Egmont by Anna Swanwick Category:Plays by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe Category:1788 plays Category:Plays set in the 16th century Category:Plays set in the Netherlands Category:Cultural depictions of Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba Category:Cultural depictions of William the Silent ","title":"Egmont (play)"},{"id":"1879423","title":"Jones AT&amp;T Stadium"},{"id":"1879426","text":"John Henry Comstock (February 24, 1849 ‚Äì March 20, 1931) was an eminent researcher in entomology and arachnology and a leading educator.

It gives an important limitation on the efficiency with which any error-correcting code can utilize the space in which its code words are embedded. A code that attains the Hamming bound is said to be a perfect code. Background on error-correcting codes An original message and an encoded version are both composed in an alphabet of q letters. Each code word contains n letters. The original message (of length m) is shorter than n letters. The message is converted into an n-letter codeword by an encoding algorithm, transmitted over a noisy channel, and finally decoded by the receiver. The decoding process interprets a garbled codeword, referred to as simply a word, as the valid codeword \\"nearest\\" the n-letter received string. Mathematically, there are exactly qm possible messages of length m, and each message can be regarded as a vector of length m. The encoding scheme converts an m-dimensional vector into an n-dimensional vector. Exactly qm valid codewords are possible, but any one of qn words can be received because the noisy channel might distort one or more of the n letters when a codeword is transmitted.  Statement of the bound  Let \\\\ A_q(n,d) denote the maximum possible size of a q-ary block code \\\\ C of length n and minimum Hamming distance d (a q-ary block code of length n is a subset of the strings of \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n\\\\text{,} where the alphabet set \\\\mathcal{A}_q has q elements). Then, the Hamming bound is: : \\\\ A_q(n,d) \\\\leq \\\\frac{q^n}{\\\\sum_{k=0}^t \\\\binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k} where :t=\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{d-1}{2}\\\\right\\\\rfloor. Proof It follows from the definition of d that if at most : t = \\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{1}{2}(d-1)\\\\right\\\\rfloor errors are made during transmission of a codeword then minimum distance decoding will decode it correctly (i.e., it decodes the received word as the codeword that was sent). Thus the code is said to be capable of correcting t errors. For each codeword c \\\\in C, consider a ball of fixed radius t around c. Every pair of these balls (Hamming spheres) are non-intersecting by the t-error-correcting property. Let m be the number of words in each ball (in other words, the volume of the ball). A word that is in such a ball can deviate in at most t components from those of the ball's centre, which is a codeword. The number of such words is then obtained by choosing up to t of the n components of a codeword to deviate to one of (q-1) possible other values (recall, the code is q-ary: it takes values in \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n). Thus, :m = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\sum_{k=0}^t \\\\binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k \\\\end{matrix}. A_q (n,d) is the (maximum) total number of codewords in C, and so, by the definition of t, the greatest number of balls with no two balls having a word in common. Taking the union of the words in these balls centered at codewords, results in a set of words, each counted precisely once, that is a subset of \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n (where \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n = q^n words) and so: : A_q(n,d) \\\\times m = A_q(n,d) \\\\times \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\sum_{k=0}^t \\\\binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k \\\\end{matrix} \\\\leq q^n. Whence: :A_q(n,d) \\\\leq \\\\frac{q^n}{ \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\sum_{k=0}^t \\\\binom{n}{k}(q-1)^k \\\\end{matrix}}. Covering radius and packing radius : For an A_q(n,d) code C (a subset of \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n), the covering radius of C is the smallest value of r such that every element of \\\\mathcal{A}_q^n is contained in at least one ball of radius r centered at each codeword of C. The packing radius of C is the largest value of s such that the set of balls of radius s centered at each codeword of C are mutually disjoint. From the proof of the Hamming bound, it can be seen that for t\\\\,=\\\\,\\\\left\\\\lfloor\\\\frac{1}{2}(d-1)\\\\right\\\\rfloor, we have: :: s ‚â§ t and t ‚â§ r. Therefore, s ‚â§ r and if equality holds then s = r = t. The case of equality means that the Hamming bound is attained.  Perfect codes  Codes that attain the Hamming bound are called perfect codes. Examples include codes that have only one codeword, and codes that are the whole of \\\\scriptstyle\\\\mathcal{A}_q^n. Another example is given by the repeat codes, where each symbol of the message is repeated an odd fixed number of times to obtain a codeword where q = 2. All of these examples are often called the trivial perfect codes. In 1973, it was proved that any non-trivial perfect code over a prime-power alphabet has the parameters of a Hamming code or a Golay code.Hill (1988) p. 102 A perfect code may be interpreted as one in which the balls of Hamming radius t centered on codewords exactly fill out the space (t is the covering radius = packing radius). A quasi-perfect code is one in which the balls of Hamming radius t centered on codewords are disjoint and the balls of radius t+1 cover the space, possibly with some overlaps.McWilliams and Sloane, p. 19 Another way to say this is that a code is quasi-perfect if its covering radius is one greater than its packing radius.

Early life and career Robert Stell Heflin was born in Morgan County, Georgia, near the city of Madison. He was educated in Fayetteville, Georgia, where his parents settled in 1832. His father, Wyatt Heflin was the first elected Sheriff of Fayette County Georgia. Robert Heflin served in the Creek War in The Battle of Shepherd's Plantation. The battle was fought on June 9, 1836, between a force of Georgia militia and an attacking party of Creek warriors. The battle was a pivotal fight in the a war of resistance launched by Coweta, Yuchi, Hitchiti, and other tribal warriors trying to prevent the forced removal of their people from their traditional lands along the Chattahoochee River. Robert Stell was wounded by a muskett ball that broke his femur. From that event on, he always walked with a limp and a cane. His first formal job was a legal career as a Clerk of the Superior Court of Fayette County, Georgia, Fall of 1836-1840. He also studied law, and was admitted to the bar in 1840. He practiced law in Fayetteville, and served in the Georgia State Senate in 1840 and 1841. Alabama career As more land was being opened up for white Americans in east Alabama in 1844, Robert Stell and his family followed his father and siblings to Louina on the eastern side of the Tallapossa River in Randolph County, Alabama. While living in Alabama he was active in politics served in the Alabama House of Representatives in 1849, and in the Alabama State Senate in 1860. One of the few Southern Republicans, Robert Stell was opposed to secession. After resigning from the Alabama Legislature upon the State's secession, he made his home in north Randolph County Alabama. His brother, Superior Court Judge Thomas Heflin had become a wealthy and powerful individual in Alabama politics. Once the Civil War began, Robert Stell was viewed as a threat was arrested and carried to Andersonville, Georgia. Judge Thomas Heflin used his influence to have his brother Robert Stell released. When Sherman marched through Georgia, a battle was fought at Brown's Mill in Coweta County Georgia. The Union soldiers were routed by General Joseph Wheeler and some made it to the home of Robert Stell Heflin. They confiscated what they needed, and he was given vouchers by the Union soldiers for his remaining cattle and food. After the war, he was repaid for his property by the US government. Following the end of the war, he served as judge of probate for Randolph County by appointment in 1865 and was elected to that office in 1866. Probate Court Judges settled disputes involving property and land that became in contention after the Civil War. Tenure in U.S. House Robert Heflin was elected to the United States Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives representing the 3rd Congressional District of Alabama and served March 4, 1869, to March 3, 1871, the first time representatives were allowed to serve from the Confederate States. He was best noted for introducing a bill that was passed and signed into law that provided an annual pension to wounded survivors and widows of militia members who served in the Creek Indian Wars. Also of note, Heflin‚Äôs term in Congress occurred during the impeachment proceedings of US President Andrew Johnson. Shortly after Robert Stell was elected to Congress, gold was discovered at Dahlonega, Villa Rica and Carrollton Georgia; Gold Hill in Cleburne County and Cragford in Clay County, Alabama were sites of discovery. Robert Stell, along with other gold speculators, invested in the search for gold in east Alabama. This speculating ultimately cost him almost everything that he owned. Death Robert Heflin died in 1901 near Wedowee, Alabama, and his remains were interred in the Masonic Cemetery in Wedowee along with his first wife Elizabeth Phillips Heflin and Mentoria Reeves Heflin. Because of his political beliefs, he is not buried with the remainder of the Heflin Family located at Concord Church near Wadley Alabama.

Depending on the intensity of the exercise, cooling down can involve a slow jog or walk. With lower intensities stretching can be used. Cooling down allows the heart rate to return to its resting rate. Anecdotally cooling down may reduce dizziness for professional or serious athletes and vocal performers after strenuous workouts.

One study has shown that athletes who perform an appropriate cool-down are less likely to become injured. Procedure Cool downs should involve the following important steps to ensure an effective cool down. After exercise, a gradual yet continuous decrease in exercise intensity (such as from a hard run to an easy jog to a brisk walk) should be the first step in cooling down the body. Duration can vary for different people, but 3‚Äì10 minutes is considered adequate. Stretching, especially static stretching allows the muscles to be elongated and lengthened. This is the next step athletes should take to cool down. Rehydration is an essential part of the procedure and should be done either during stretching and light intensity or after these steps. Refuelling the body with water and sports drinks will keep the body hydrated.  Stretching  Static stretching Stretching is a very important factor in the procedure of cooling down. Stretching allows the bodies muscles to build elasticity and repair from aerobic and anaerobic exercise. Static stretching is the appropriate form of stretching to aid in the cooling down procedure. It aids in decreasing the body's temperature, removing lactic acid from the muscles and increasing flexibility. Each stretch should be held for a minimum of 10‚Äì20 seconds and stretched to the point of mild discomfort but not pain. Each muscle used in mid-high intensity exercise should then be stretched during the cool down.  Half-time cooling down  This is a popular process for elite sporting clubs and athletes. It involves using either ice vests, cooling products or manually cooling down the body through gentle light intensity exercise to cool down the body during half time or breaks in an activity or sport. Half-time cooling down has proven to decrease body temperature and increase aerobic performance. Many sporting groups use cooling down jackets during half-time. Australian elite sporting teams such as those in the AFL, Olympic teams, military and elite athletes across all sporting fields use cooling down vests to increase performance and gain a competitive advantage over their competition. Cardiovascular issues, health, and heart rate Paralympian using an ice vest During aerobic exercise, peripheral veins, particularly those within a muscle, dilate to accommodate the increased blood flow through exercising muscle. The skeletal- muscle pump assists in returning blood to the heart and maintaining cardiac output. A sudden cessation of strenuous exercise may cause blood to pool in peripheral dilated veins which may cause varicose veins. A cool-down period allows a more gradual return to venous tone. The heart will also need to beat faster to adequately oxygenate the body and maintain blood pressure. It is theorised that individuals predisposed to, suffering from, or at risk for cardiovascular disease may be at risk for potential negative cardiovascular outcomes if a cool down is not completed following exercise bouts due to a rapid decrease in blood reaching areas of the heart (with narrowed blood vessels due to present cardiovascular disease). This, however, is only a theory, and clinical evidence for this is currently lacking. Muscular and skeletal injuries have also been found to increase when the cool down procedure is neglected. Ankle injuries are one of the most common injuries athletes and participants are at risk of obtaining when the cool down is performed ineffectively or not at all. Injuries are decreased significantly when the cool down is performed for an adequate amount of time compared to only a short period of time.

History Along with the War Memorial Fieldhouse, War Memorial Stadium was built in the spring and summer of 1950. The stadium replaced Corbett Field, a small field opened in 1922 and located southeast of Half Acre Gym in land now used by the Business School and the student union parking lot. It originally sat 20,000 in grandstands on the east and west sides of the field. In 1970, the western upper deck, containing 5,500 seats and a new press box, was added and in 1978 the eastern press box and northern bleachers were added, bringing capacity up to 33,500.http://www.wyomingathletics.com/trads/50-facts.html The playing field runs mostly in the traditional north‚Äìsouth configuration; it is slightly skewed to the northeast and southwest about 10¬∞.

Evans, Pater-Noster-Row, 1776, p 214 Another early reference to the recreational use of oxygen is found in Jules Verne's 1870 novel Around the Moon. In this work, Verne states: Modeled after the \\"air stations\\" in polluted downtown Tokyo and Beijing, the first oxygen bar (the O2 Spa Bar) opened in Toronto, Canada, in 1996. The trend continued in North America and by the late 1990s, bars were in use in New York, California, Florida, Las Vegas and the Rocky Mountain region. Customers in these bars breathe oxygen through a plastic hose inserted into their nostrils.Altman, Nathaniel. The Oxygen Prescription: The Miracle of Oxidative Therapies. Rochester: Healing, 2007. 313‚Äì14 Oxygen bars can now be found in many venues such as nightclubs, salons, spas, health clubs, resorts, tanning salons, restaurants, coffee houses, bars, airports, ski chalets, yoga studios, chiropractors, and casinos. They can also be found at trade shows, conventions and corporate meetings, as well as at private parties and promotional events. Provision of oxygen Oxygen bar guests pay about one U.S. dollar per minute to inhale a percentage of oxygen greater than the normal atmospheric content of 20.9% oxygen. This oxygen is produced from the ambient air by an industrial (non-medical) oxygen concentrator and inhaled through a nasal cannula for up to about 20 minutes. The machines used by oxygen bars or oxygen vendors differ from the typical medical-issue machine, although customers use the cannula, the rubber tube apparatus that fits around the ears and inserts in the nostrils, to breathe in the oxygen. Customers can enhance their experience by using aromatherapy scents to be added to the oxygen, such as lavender or mint.Stalling, Ann E., \\"A breath of fresher air.\\" Ball State Daily News. 27 Feb. 2004:1. http://www.bsudailynews.com/home/search/ Health risks and benefit claims It has been claimed by alternative medicine that the human body is oxygen-deprived, and that oxygen will remove \\"toxins\\" and even cure cancer.Wanjek, Christopher. \\"Suffocating Trends: Oxygen Bars and Drinks.\\" LiveScience (2006): 1. 25 June 2009. http://www.livescience.com/health/060418_bad_oxygen.html Proponents claim this practice is not only safe, but enhances health and well-being, including strengthening the immune system, enhancing concentration, reducing stress, increasing energy and alertness, lessening the effects of hangovers, headaches, and sinus problems, and generally relaxing the body. It has also been alleged to help with altitude sickness. However, no long-term, well- controlled scientific studies have confirmed any of the proponents' claims. Furthermore, the human body is adapted to 21 percent oxygen, and the blood exiting the lungs already has about 97 percent of the oxygen that it could carry bound to hemoglobin. Having a higher oxygen fraction in the lungs serves no purpose, and may actually be detrimental. The medical profession warns that individuals with respiratory diseases such as asthma and emphysema should not inhale too much oxygen. Higher than normal oxygen partial pressure can also indirectly cause carbon dioxide narcosis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The FDA warns that in some situations, droplets of flavoring oil can be inhaled, which may contribute to an inflammation of the lungs. Some oxygen bar companies offer safe water-based aromas for flavoring in order to maintain compliance and stay within FDA guidelines. Oxygen may also cause serious side effects at excessive doses. Although the effects of oxygen toxicity at atmospheric pressure can cause lung damage, the low fraction of oxygen (30-40%)\\"Oxygen Delivery Methods.\\" American Thoracic Society. http://www.thoracic.org/clinical/copd-guidelines/for-health- professionals/exacerbation/inpatient-oxygen-therapy/oxygen-delivery- methods.php Accessed 9 July 2013. and relatively brief exposures make pulmonary toxicity unlikely. Nevertheless, due caution should be exercised when consuming oxygen. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive publishes guidance on equipment (including tubing) and on staff training, as well as warning on potential hazards, and makes several recommendations to ensure safe practice, principally to minimise fire risks. Another concern is the improper maintenance of oxygen equipment. Some oxygen concentrators use clay filters which cause micro-organisms to grow, creating an additional danger that can cause lung infections.Chavis, Vicki F., \\"Oxygen Bars - Health Benefit or Hazard.\\" Natural Medicine 9 Apr. 2009: 2 Safety hazards Raised concentrations of oxygen increase the risk of ignition, the rate and heat of combustion, and the difficulty of extinguishing a fire. Many materials that will not burn in air will burn in a sufficiently high partial pressure of oxygen. Regulations In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines any substance used for breathing and administered by another person as a prescription drug. Melvin Szymanski, a consumer safety officer in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, has explained that at one end of the hose is a source of oxygen, so the individual providing the hose and turning on the supply is dispensing a prescription drug. He commented that \\"Although oxygen bars that dispense oxygen without a prescription violate FDA regulations, the agency applies regulatory discretion to permit the individual state boards of licensing to enforce the requirements pertaining to the dispensing of oxygen.\\" Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists says that \\"As health professionals, we cannot ethically or morally support providing oxygen therapy to those who do not require it.\\"Sorgen, Carol. \\"The Rise of Oxygen Bars.\\" WebMD (2002):1-2. http://www.webmd.com/balance/features/rise-of-oxygen-bars See also  * *  References  Category:Biologically-based therapies Category:Gases Category:Oxygen Category:Industrial gases ","title":"Oxygen bar"},{"id":"1879441","text":"View of conference center Entrance to main courtyard and student center.

It is represented by the chemical formula HgS. It is virtually insoluble in water. Crystal structure Cinnabar from Nevada, US HgS is dimorphic with two crystal forms: * red cinnabar (Œ±-HgS, trigonal, hP6, P3221), is the form in which mercury is most commonly found in nature. * black, metacinnabar (Œ≤-HgS), is less common in nature and adopts the zinc blende (T2d-F'3m) crystal structure. Crystals of red, Œ±-HgS, are optically active. This is caused by the Hg-S helices in the structure. Preparation and chemistry Œ≤-HgS is precipitated as a black powder when H2S is bubbled through solutions of Hg(II) salts. Œ≤-HgS is unreactive to all but concentrated acids. Mercury metal is produced from the cinnabar ore by roasting in air and condensing the vapour. Uses When Œ±-HgS is used as a red pigment, it is known as vermilion. The tendency of vermilion to darken has been ascribed to conversion from red Œ±-HgS to black Œ≤-HgS. However Œ≤-HgS was not detected at excavations in Pompeii, where originally red walls darkened, and was attributed to the formation of Hg-Cl compounds (e.g., corderoite, calomel, and terlinguaite) and calcium sulfate, gypsum. As the mercury cell as used in the chlor-alkali industry (Castner‚ÄìKellner process) is being phased out over concerns over mercury emissions, the metallic mercury from these setups is converted into mercury sulfide for underground storage.

The client-software is written in the Java programming language. Cross-platform, free and open source, it sends requests through a Mix Cascade and mixes the data streams of multiple users in order to further obfuscate the data to outsiders. JonDonym is available for all platforms that support Java. Furthermore, ANONdroid is a JonDonym proxy client for Android.ANONdroid v. 00.00.008 2011-12-22  Design  The JonDonym client program allows the user to choose among several Mix Cascades (i.e. a group of anonymization proxies) offered by independent organisations. Users may choose by themselves whom of these operators they will trust, and whom they won't. This is different from peer-to-peer based anonymity networks like Tor and I2P, whose anonymization proxies are anonymous themselves, which means the users have to rely on unknown proxy operators. However, it means that all the relays used for JonDonym-mediated connections are known and identified, and therefore potentially targeted very easily by hackers, governmental agencies or lobbying groups. This has for example led to the issues mentioned below, where court orders essentially gave all control over the whole system to the German government. As discussed below, solutions like international distribution of the relays and the additional use of Tor can somewhat mitigate this loss of independence. The speed and availability of the service depends on the operators of the Mixes in the cascades, and therefore varies. More users on a cascade improve anonymity, but a large number of users might diminish the speed and bandwidth available for a single user.  Cost, name change and commercial service  Use of JonDonym has been (and still is) free, but since financial backing of the original university research project ran out on 22 June 2007, a startup, Jondos GmbH, was founded by members of the original project team. Jondos GmbH has taken over development and continues to work on an improved blocking resistance function that would make it easier for users from restrictive countries to get a connection to the system. As a consequence, the JAP client has been renamed to JonDo and the service itself from AN.ON to JonDonym.JonDonym press release 2007 JonDonym mix cascades are mostly operated by SMEs in multiple countries and mix cascades always include three mix servers for advanced security. As contractors of Jondos GmbH must ensure sufficient throughput of their mixes, anonymous web browsing at standard DSL speeds is possible. Cost free Cascades are still in operation, although they do not offer the low latency, multiple Mixes per Cascade or guaranteed bandwidth the commercial ones do.  Privacy  The online activities of the user can be revealed only if all Mixes of a Cascade work together by keeping log files and correlating their logs. However, all Mix operators have to sign a voluntary commitment not to keep such logs, and for any observer it is difficult to infiltrate all operators in a long cascade. In July 2003, the German BKAReport on the Legal Proceedings against the Project, AN.ON ProjectAN.ON still guarantees anonymity 19. August 2003 obtained a warrant to force the Dresden Mix operators to log access to a specific web address, which was hosting child pornography. AN.ON then decided to introduce a crime detection function in the server software in order to make this possible. The feature was made transparent by publishing the changed source code on August 18, 2003, and subsequently criticized by many users. For the Dresden Mix, the feature continues to be part of their software until today. Tracing activities back in the past is still technically not possible for the operators, but anonymity now extends only to the time-point that a surveillance court order is issued.Project Declaration on the Future Relationship with Criminal Justice Authorities, AN.ON Project, 02. July 2013 It was pointed out though that the new feature was covered by the AN.ON threat model and not a security leak by itself. As a reaction to the threat from local authorities, the system has spread internationally. If the Mixes of a cascade are spread over several countries, the law enforcement agencies of all these countries would have to work together to reveal someone's identity.Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router AN.ON publishes every year the number of successful and unsuccessful surveillance court orders.Law enforcement, AN.ON Project, 02. July 2013 Further research is being done by AN.ON to make the crime detection functionality more privacy-friendly. Since May 2006, JonDonym can also be used as a client for the Tor network and since 2006 also for the Mixminion network. These features are still in an early stage and available only in the beta version of the software.

In the episode, Butters survives a murder attempt by his own mother after discovering his father's homosexual dalliances and must travel back to South Park in time for his parents' wedding anniversary at Bennigan's. Meanwhile, Butters' parents join John and Patsy Ramsey, Gary Condit, and O. J. Simpson in lying to the press about who murdered Butters. The episode was written by series co-creator Trey Parker. It is notable for being the first episode to center around Butters and a parody of 1950s sitcoms, albeit in a more dark comedic route. ‚ÄúButters‚Äô Very Own Episode‚Äù received largely positive reviews from critics, many of whom praised the shift of focus to Butters. Plot Butters expresses excitement about his parents' upcoming anniversary, which they are going to celebrate at Butters' favorite restaurant, Bennigan's. A few days before their anniversary, his mother, Linda, asks Butters to spy on his father, Chris, in order to find out what his gift for her will be so that her own will not fall short. While spying, Butters watches Chris enter first a gay theater and then a gay bathhouse (though Butters is too naive to understand the nature of his father's activity). Upon returning home, Butters reports to his mother about his father's whereabouts, leaving her appalled by her husband's homosexual affairs, becoming visibly distraught and unhinged. Linda then attempts to murder Butters by dumping her car in a river with him inside. Hours later, Chris enters the home to find his wife attempting to hang herself. He rushes to her side and explains that his homoerotic tendencies stem from chatting with other bi-curious and married men on the Internet. He insists he still loves her and does not want to lose his family over his \\"addiction\\". Linda then admits to having drowned Butters, to which Chris promises that he will not let her go to jail. The next day, the Stotches confront the press about their son, stating that he was abducted by \\"some Puerto Rican guy\\". As the media centers in on the \\"missing child\\" case, the pair are inducted into a club of infamous, highly publicized characters whose loved ones have also been \\"taken from them by Some Puerto Rican Guy\\", including Gary Condit, O. J. Simpson, and John and Patricia Ramsey. Butters, however, survives his mother's attempt to kill him, and brushes off the incident as an accident. He then sets off home, eager to get back in time to celebrate his parents' anniversary with them. First does some singing and dancing at a seedy 'dance' club, and then heads down a scary road after getting directions from an elderly Mechanic. He returns home to find his parents fighting over all the lies they have told, and shocks them that he is still alive. Upon hearing what the quarrel was about, he scolds them for lying and trying to teach him to lie. Deciding to follow in their son's footsteps, they come clean to the media about the cover- up, revealing many unsettling facts to Butters in the process. Afterwards, Stan, Kyle and Cartman chastise Butters about his unhinged parents. Although he attempts to make light of the situation, Butters admits that he is now probably scarred for life, the boys are gonna really go to town on him, and sometimes lying really can be for the best. Production Written by series co-creator Trey Parker and directed by animation director Eric Stough, \\"Butters' Very Own Episode\\" was rated TV-MA in the United States, and originally aired on December 12, 2001 on Comedy Central. In the DVD commentary, Parker and Stone indicate they planned to make Butters the fourth group member after Kenny was written off the show, and created this episode as a prelude to his assuming a more prominent role in the series. Reception IGN gave \\"Butters Very Own Episode\\" a positive rating of 8.5, stating, \\"There are several classic moments in this episode, but it all works so well because of the setup.\\" Legacy At the time of the episode, suspicion hung over Gary Condit regarding the disappearance of Chandra Levy, and the Ramseys regarding the murder of their daughter JonBen√©t. However, someone else was later convicted for the murder of Chandra Levy and Condit was thought to be exonerated. (Subsequently, prosecutors dropped all charges on July 28, 2016, after an associate of the sole witness came forward with secret recordings in which the witness admitted to falsifying testimony about the murder of Chandra Levy. The murder of Chandra Levy therefore remains unsolved.) The Ramsey family were also deemed innocent by the district attorney in the case. In a 2011 interview, South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone stated that they regretted how Condit and the Ramseys were portrayed in the episode. Home release \\"Butters' Very Own Episode\\", along with the fourteen other episodes from South Park: the Complete Fifth Season, were released on a three- disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The set includes brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode. The episode was also released on the two-disc DVD collection A Little Box of Butters.

Background Rumbles was born in South Shields in England and was educated at St James School in Hebburn, County Durham, Sunderland Polytechnic where he graduated with a BEd, and Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst. He served in the Royal Army Education Corps retiring as a Major in October 1994. Career Rumbles was elected to the West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine constituency in the 1999 election, and comfortably held the seat in the 2003 election and 2007 election but was defeated by the SNP in 2011. Following the Scottish Parliament's establishment in 1999, Rumbles was Convenor of the Standards Committee when it was charged with investigating the so-called 'Lobbygate' scandal, in which the son of the then Secretary of State for Scotland John Reid was embroiled. He promoted the legislation to establish an independent Standards Commissioner, the first Committee Bill of the Parliament.Stewart, Thomas A.W. (Ed.) (2019), The Scottish Parliament in its Own Words: An Oral History, Luath Press, p.45 Leadership contests On 12 May 2005, Rumbles announced his intention to stand for the vacant post of leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats. His candidacy involved a distinct platform from his opponent Nicol Stephen. In particular, he specified a number of 'deal- breakers' for any coalition negotiations that might occur in the aftermath of the 2007 Scottish Parliament elections, with an absolute insistence on the implementation of key Liberal Democrat policies such as abolition of the council tax, and an enhancement of the Scottish Parliament's powers. He also aimed to give the Liberal Democrats a more equal status within the coalition. He lost to Stephen in June 2005, winning 23.4% of the vote. On 2 July 2008, following Stephen's surprise resignation as leader, Rumbles again announced his intention to stand for the Scottish Liberal Democrat leadership. This time he stressed his commitment to reviewing party policy on whether to hold a national referendum on Scottish Independence (the policy of the Scottish National Party government). In the contest he faced former Ministers Ross Finnie and Tavish Scott. Scott won the contest comfortably.

This chlorine oxide is the anhydride of perchloric acid. It is produced by the careful distillation of perchloric acid in the presence of the dehydrating agent phosphorus pentoxide: :2 HClO4 \\\\+ P4O10 ‚Üí Cl2O7 \\\\+ H2P4O11 The chlorine(VII) oxide can be distilled off from the mixture. It may also be formed by illumination on mixtures of chlorine and ozone. It slowly hydrolyzes back to perchloric acid, which is also hazardous when anhydrous. Structure Cl2O7 is an endergonic molecule, meaning it is intrinsically unstable, decomposing to its constituent elements with release of energy: :2 Cl2O7 ‚Üí 2 Cl2 \\\\+ 7 O2 (ŒîH¬∞ = ‚Äì132 kcal/mol) Cl2O7 is bent with Cl‚àíO‚àíCl angle of 118.6¬∞ giving the molecule C2 symmetry. The terminal Cl‚àíO distances are 1.709 √Ö and the Cl=O distances are 1.405 √Ö. In this compound, chlorine exists in its highest formal oxidation state of +7, although the bonding in this molecule is significantly covalent. Chemistry Dichlorine heptoxide reacts with primary and secondary amines in carbon tetrachloride solution to yield perchloric amides: :2 + ‚Üí 2 + :2 + ‚Üí 2 + It also reacts with alkenes to give alkyl perchlorates. For example, it reacts with propene in carbon tetrachloride solution to yield isopropyl perchlorate and 1-chloro-2-propyl perchlorate. Dichlorine heptoxide is a strongly acidic oxide, and in solution it forms an equilibrium with perchloric acid. Safety Although it is the most stable chlorine oxide, Cl2O7 is a strong oxidizer as well as an explosive that can be set off with flame or mechanical shock, or by contact with iodine. Nevertheless, it is less strongly oxidising than the other chlorine oxides, and does not attack sulfur, phosphorus, or paper when cold. It has the same effects on the human body as elemental chlorine, and requires the same precautions.

It was first synthesised in 1834 by Antoine J√©r√¥me Balard, who along with Gay- Lussac also determined its composition. In older literature it is often referred to as chlorine monoxide, which can be a source of confusion as that name now refers to the neutral species ClO. At room temperature it exists as a brownish-yellow gas which is soluble in both water and organic solvents. Chemically, it is a member of the chlorine oxide family of compounds, as well as being the anhydride of hypochlorous acid. It is a strong oxidiser and chlorinating agent.

However this method is expensive, as well as highly dangerous due to the risk of mercury poisoning. :2 Cl2 \\\\+ HgO ‚Üí HgCl2 \\\\+ Cl2O A safer and more convenient method of production is the reaction of chlorine gas with hydrated sodium carbonate, at 20-30 ¬∞C. :2 Cl2 \\\\+ 2 Na2CO3 \\\\+ H2O ‚Üí Cl2O + 2 NaHCO3 \\\\+ 2 NaCl :2 Cl2 \\\\+ 2 NaHCO3 ‚Üí Cl2O + 2 CO2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl + H2O This reaction can be performed in the absence of water but requires heating to 150-250 ¬∞C; as dichlorine monoxide is unstable at these temperatures it must therefore be continuously removed to prevent thermal decomposition. :2 Cl2 \\\\+ Na2CO3 ‚Üí Cl2O + CO2 \\\\+ 2 NaCl Structure The structure of dichlorine monoxide is similar to that of water and hypochlorous acid, with the molecule adopting a bent molecular geometry due to the lone pairs on the oxygen; resulting in C2V molecular symmetry. The bond angle is slightly larger than normal, likely due to steric repulsion between the bulky chlorine atoms. File:H2O 2D labelled.svg File:Hypochlorous- acid-2D-dimensions.svg File:Dichlorine-oxide-2D-dimensions.png In the solid state, it crystallises in the tetrahedral space group I41/amd, making it isostructural to the high pressure form of water, ice VIII. Reactions Dichlorine monoxide is highly soluble in water, where it exists in an equilibrium with HOCl. The rate of hydrolysis is slow enough to allow the extraction of Cl2O with organic solvents such as CCl4, but the equilibrium constant ultimately favours the formation of hypochlorous acid. :2 HOCl ‚áå Cl2O + H2O K (0 ¬∞C) = 3.55x10‚àí3 dm3/mol Despite this, it has been suggested that dichlorine monoxide may be the active species in the reactions of HOCl with olefins and aromatic compounds, as well as in the chlorination of drinking water. With inorganic compounds Dichlorine monoxide reacts with metal halides, with the loss of Cl2, to form unusual oxyhalides. :VOCl3 \\\\+ Cl2O ‚Üí VO2Cl + 2 Cl2 :TiCl4 \\\\+ Cl2O ‚Üí TiOCI2 \\\\+ 2 Cl2 :SbCI5 \\\\+ 2 CI2O ‚Üí SbO2CI + 4 Cl2 Similar reactions have also been observed with certain inorganic halides. :AsCI3 \\\\+ 2 CI2O ‚Üí AsO2CI + 3 Cl2 :NOCl + Cl2O ‚Üí NO2Cl + Cl2 With organic compounds Dichlorine monoxide is an effective chlorinating agent. It can be used for either the side-chain or ring chlorination of deactivated aromatic substrates. For activated aromatics such as phenols and aryl-ethers it primarily reacts to give ring halogenated products. It has been suggested that dichlorine monoxide may be the active species in the reactions of HOCl with olefins and aromatic compounds. Photochemistry Dichlorine monoxide undergoes photodissociation, eventually forming O2 and Cl2. The process is primarily radical based, with flash photolysis showing radical hypochlorite (ClO¬∑) to be a key intermediate. :2 Cl2O ‚Üí 2 Cl2 \\\\+ O2 Explosive properties Dichlorine monoxide is explosive, although there is a lack of modern research into this behaviour. Room temperature mixtures with oxygen could not be detonated by an electric spark until they contained at least 23.5% Cl2O. which is an exceedingly high minimum explosive limit. There are conflicting reports of it exploding on exposure to strong light. Heating above 120 ¬∞C, or a rapid rate of heating at lower temperatures also apparently lead to explosions. Liquid dichlorine monoxide has been reported to be shock- sensitive.

Early life and priesthood Zwijsen was ordained a priest on 19 January 1817. He would first serve as a chaplain in Schijndel, after which he would become a pastor in Tilburg. During his time in Tilburg, he met the then heir apparent William II of the Netherlands. A strong friendship formed between the two, so strong even that some contemporaries implied a homosexual relationship. However, this seems to be founded merely in rumors. This unique bond that he shared with the king reached a culmination when he attended him at his deathbed in 1849. During this friendship with William II, Zwijsen became acquainted with the Dutch government, with people as Johan Rudolph Thorbecke in particular. Titular Bishop and Apostolic Vicar On 17 April 1842, he was consecrated Titular bishop of Geras and Coadjutor of the Apostolic vicar of s-Hertogenbosch, at Church of Saint Denis in Tilburg, by baron Cornelius Ludovicus van Wijkerslooth, ordaining bishop for the Netherlands. Zwijsen took as his episcopal motto: Mansuete et fortiter, mild and strong. He would live up to this motto by keeping his head down whenever he got into conflict with the protestant population, even once telling Pope Pius IX that the best way to achieve anything in his country was to do it silently. This did not mean he sat on his hands. He founded the Sisters of Charity of Our Lady Mother of Mercy as a teaching order, and the Brothers of Our Lady Mother of Mercy to carry out works of charity and works of mercy. In 1847 he was appointed Apostolic vicar of the Dutch Mission (Hollandse Zending), until 1848. First Archbishop of Utrecht When Pope Pius IX, with the apostolic letter \\"Ex qua die\\", reorganized the Catholic Church of the Netherlands, Utrecht was raised once more to an archbishopric, and Zwijsen was named the first archbishop; as administrator he also ruled the diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch. His connection to the Dutch government, one he had obtained through his friendship with William II, was most probably a factor in this appointment. He took up with great energy and caution the organization of the restored archdiocese, even though he had preferred it to be based in s-Hertogenbosch. By numerous excellent decrees he provided for the improvement of discipline, the encouragement of orders and of church associations and for the establishment of Catholic schools. In 1857 opened the diocesan seminary for the training of a competent clergy. In 1858 the cathedral chapters of the archdiocese were organized and in 1864 the first provincial synod was held. Resignation and Death In 1868 he resigned as archbishop of Utrecht, retaining only the direction of the diocese of 's-Hertogenbosch. Here he remained bishop until his death on October 16 1877.

Early Life and education Swift was born on Nantucket Island, the son of Foster Swift and his wife, Deborah. At the age of six, he saw George Washington on Boston Common, an experience that made an indelible impression on him. In 1792, the Swifts moved to Taunton, Massachusetts, where Joseph became the student of Reverend Simeon Doggett, who prepared him to enter Harvard College. Swift had read accounts of the American Revolution in his father‚Äôs diary and heard stories from a family friend, Major General David Cobb. With Cobb‚Äôs advice and assistance, Swift was appointed by President John Adams on May 12, 1800 as a cadet of artillerists and engineers. He reported for duty a month later at Newport Harbor. Later, in the summer of 1801, Secretary of War Henry Dearborn notified the Army that President Thomas Jefferson had directed the establishment of a military academy at West Point, New York. Swift reported as a cadet to the academy on October 14, 1801. On December 15, 1801, then-Major Jonathan Williams took command and several months later became the first Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. The Academy was established by law on March 16, 1802. Swift progressed well and was considered by Williams to be the foremost cadet. After a thorough examination, Swift became the first graduate of the Academy on October 12, 1802. Simeon Magruder Levy was the only other graduate in 1802. 1802-1814 Swift remained at West Point until April 30, 1804, and in June of that year, became the superintending engineer of the construction of the defenses of the mouth of the Cape Fear River in North Carolina. In January 1805 he became the commander of Fort Johnson, North Carolina. Swift returned to West Point in 1807 and took command of the Academy in Williams' absence. He remained there until November 23 of that year, when the Academy was closed for the winter vacation. Swift was promoted to Major in February 1808 and assigned to lead the defenses of the Eastern Department covering the New England coast. He was assigned with Joseph Gilbert Totten and Sylvanus Thayer, also graduates of West Point. Once again, Swift was assigned to his old station at the mouth of the Cape Fear River where he was charged with superintending and inspecting southern coast defenses until 1812. In July 1812, Jonathan Williams resigned as Chief Engineer of the Army, and Swift, then a lieutenant colonel and the next senior Engineer in the Army, assumed his command. His appointment as Colonel and Chief Engineer of the Army was unanimously confirmed in December 1812. Pending his confirmation, Swift was ordered back to his duties to superintend the defenses of North Carolina. Before leaving Washington, he ordered Captain Alden Partridge, the senior Engineer officer at West Point, to open the Military Academy (then practically defunct) in the coming spring. Swift was 30 years old upon becoming Chief Engineer of the Army and Superintendent of the United States Military Academy. In March 1813, Swift was called to Washington and consulted with the Secretary of War on the application of large appropriations for fortification of coastal defenses. He then reported to New York City to supervise the fortifications process, acting in his capacity as the Chief Engineer and Superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy. As Superintendent, Swift made frequent trips to West Point; he initiated plans for a new mess hall, academic building, and South Barracks and was authorized to employ an acting chaplain to be Professor of Ethics, History, and Geography (the first such being Rev. Adam Empie). He remodeled the functions of the academic staff and assumed the duties of inspector of the institution to oversee the authority of the local commander, Captain Partridge. With the repairs of New York Harbor completed and fortifications against the British fleet in place, Swift requested orders for the field. He became the Chief Engineer of the Northern Army under Major General James Wilkinson, which took him to the ill-fated St. Lawrence Campaign; here Swift won a citation for gallantry in the battle of Chrysler's Farm. He was breveted a brigadier general on February 19, 1814. The Secretary of War refused Swift further field service because coastal defenses required attention and sent Swift again to New York where, in conjunction with the Committee of Safety, he established plans for coastal defenses for New York and Brooklyn and supervised thousands of volunteers working on the project. For that effort the Corporation of New York named him Benefactor to the City. 1814-1818 After completing the defenses of New York, Swift was called upon to form a new system of infantry tactics, to reduce the Army to a peacetime establishment, and later, with Colonel George Bomford, to rebuild the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C., which had been destroyed by the British in the War of 1812. Shortly after the war, Congress authorized the President to employ Brigadier General Simon Bernard of the French Army, a distinguished engineer under Napoleon, as an assistant in the Corps of Engineers. He was placed at the head of the Board of Engineers while Swift became solely Superintendent of the Military Academy. Swift protested the admission of foreigners into the American military, who in the event of war might become enemies. However, Bernard stayed on the Board of Engineers until 1831. As Superintendent, Swift recommended sending two Engineer officers to Europe to examine French and Dutch fortifications and to purchase books to form a library at West Point. It was also hoped that one of them would replace him as Superintendent. Swift also secured a loan from Jacob Barker, a rich Quaker merchant, because no government appropriations were available. Swift saved the institution from abandonment when he personally arranged a $65,000 loan at 7% interest. For some time, Swift remained in local command at West Point, and in January 1817, proceeded to Washington to present his grievances to President James Madison. This resulted in Swift‚Äôs resuming his position in Washington at the head of the Corps of Engineers and leaving Bernard without any military control. Swift accompanied newly elected President James Monroe on his trip to examine the northern states and during the seven-week excursion was able to study the battlefields of the American Revolution and the War of 1812, as well as inspect arsenals, Navy yards and fortifications, and study the capacity of the country for defense. He also examined institutions of learning, particularly the Military Academy, in which Monroe was very interested. At the time of this visit to West Point, it was decided that Partridge would be replaced by then- Major Sylvanus Thayer, who, in 1817, was appointed Superintendent of the Academy and later became known as \\"the Father of West Point\\". The Presidential tour continued to Maine, and Swift and a joint board of Army and Navy officers examined fortifications from Penobscot, Maine, to Connecticut. He also traveled to the Chesapeake Bay area and chose a site for a Navy yard at Norfolk, Virginia. In 1818, just before leaving the military, Swift‚Äôs main duties were in Virginia. He studied the northern tributaries of the Chesapeake and made his last inspection of the Military Academy in September 1818. He was engaged with Governeur Kemble and four others in establishing the West Point Foundry at Cold Spring-on-the-Hudson. After contemplating civilian life for more than two years, he submitted his resignation on November 12, 1818, reserving all his rights as a brevet brigadier general in the Army, to be called into service in the event of war. He maintained this status until his death. Soon after he left the Army, Swift was asked by the Corps of Engineers to sit for a portrait in his honor. The portrait, painted by Sully, was hung in the Library at the Academy upon its completion and hangs there today. 1818-1832 The day after his resignation, Swift accepted the surveyorship of the Port of New York. As a civil engineer, he soon became involved in various important projects. In 1819, he was consulted on the feasibility of banking and draining the Newark Flats. In 1820 he was appointed by the Legislature of New Jersey to superintend the plan to open the Morris Canal improvement. In 1822 he was one of three Commissioners charged with regulating streets and drainage of the eastern part of the City of New York. In 1825, he was appointed as commissioner to determine the capacity of the Bronx and Croton Rivers to supply New York City with pure water. Unfortunately for Swift, during this time he decided to venture into business dealings on Wall Street. In 1825, he was elected vice president of a life and trust insurance company. The company failed, and all its members were indicted for conspiracy to defraud the state. Swift was acquitted but suffered the loss of all his property. Without means to support his family, Swift moved to a small farm belonging to his wife in Haywood County, Tennessee, where he built a small cabin and began growing cotton. Finding the title to his plantation defective and his children suffering from the weather, Swift returned to New York and to his career in civil engineering; within the following year took charge of the Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad in Maryland. In March 1829, he was appointed superintendent of the harbor improvements on Lake Ontario and held this position for sixteen years. While the lake works were suspended during the winter of 1829, Swift took charge of construction of a new railroad from New Orleans to Lake Pontchartrain that was routed five miles through a dense swamp, which was considered impassable as it could be neither drained nor piled. This was a pioneer railroad of the South, and perhaps the first in America where iron edge rails were used. In 1832, Swift succeeded Benjamin Wright as Chief Engineer of the New York and Harlem Railroad, but interference from the Board of Directors caused him to resign. 1832-1865 Swift moved to Geneva, New York, and Hobart College elected him Professor of Engineering and Statistics. Though he declined this honor, he accepted the membership offered to him in the Society of Statistics of Paris, France, and took a great interest in statistical and educational matters. In 1833, Swift was asked to present his views on how far the West Point system of discipline and instruction could be adapted to a university to be established in the City of New York. In 1834, he proposed a plan to Governor William L. Marcy for normal schools and advised the school system to secure the services of Professor Horace Webster as Superintendent of the Free Academy, which later became the College of the City of New York. Marriage and family Swift married Louisa Margaret Walker, the daughter of James and M.M. Walker, on June 6, 1805 in North Carolina. They had at least six children.Washington Street Cemetery Death Swift died on July 23, 1865 in Geneva, aged eighty-two, and was buried in Washington Street Cemetery in Geneva next to his wife, who had died in Geneva on November 15, 1855. Six of their children are also buried there: * Charlotte Swift, born April 5, 1826, died December 31, 1840; * Julius H. Swift, died February 6, 1850, aged 35; * Thomas Delano Swift, born Wilmington, November 27, 1812, died Geneva September 1829; * James Thomas Swift, died July 31, 1890; * Foster Swift, M.D., born Geneva October 31, 1833, died Santa Cruz, West Indies May 10, 1875; * Jonathan Williams Swift, Commodore, United States Navy, born Taunton, March 30, 1808, died Geneva July 30, 1877.

It has also been introduced to Latin America, the Caribbean, and the southeastern United States. It is a highly flammable fire-adapted species, and can spread rapidly by colonizing disturbed areas and encouraging more frequent wildfires.  Common names  Imperata cylindrica on a mountainside in Bukidnon, Philippines The species is most commonly known in English as \\"cogongrass\\", from Spanish cog√≥n, from the Tagalog and Visayan kugon. Other common names in English include kunai grass, blady grass, satintail, spear grass, sword grass, thatch grass, alang-alang, lalang grass, cotton wool grass, and kura-kura among other names. Description It grows from 0.6 to 3 m (2 to 10 feet) tall. The leaves are about 2 cm wide near the base of the plant and narrow to a sharp point at the top; the margins are finely toothed and are embedded with sharp silica crystals. The main vein is a lighter colour than the rest of the leaf and tends to be nearer to one side of the leaf. The upper surface is hairy near the base of the plant while the underside is usually hairless. Cogongrass has an extensive rhizome network, the biomass of which accounts for 60% of the total biomass of the plant. They can penetrate up to deep, but is typical in sandy soil.  Flammability  Green cogongrass on fire in Papua New Guinea Cogongrass is a fire-adapted species. It is highly flammable, even when still apparently green, particularly in tropical climates. It is not uncommon to see hillsides of cogongrass on fire. Cogongrass depends on regular fires to spread and maintain ecological dominance. Because of its density and high biomass, cogongrass provides a very high fuel load, enabling wildfires to burn faster, higher, and much hotter. This is hot enough to kill most competing plants, including trees. After a fire, cogongrass will recolonize the area using their rhizome network which was unaffected by the fire. A common expression in the Philippines is ningas cogon ('cogon brush fire'). It is a figure of speech for procrastination, specifically people who show a fervent interest in a new project but lose interest quickly, in reference to the propensity of cogongrass to catch fire and burn out quickly.  Phytochemistry  The plant contains the triterpenoids arundoin, cylindrin and fernenol.The structures of arundoin, cylindrin and fernenol : Triterpenoids of fernane and arborane groups of imperata cylindrica var. koenigii.

Natori, Tetrahedron, 1968, Volume 24, Issue 2, Pages 735‚Äì752, Cultivation and uses A Japanese bloodgrass cultivar, Imperata cylindrica 'Red Baron', grown as an ornamental It is used for thatching the roofs of traditional homes throughout south-east Asia. Imperata cylindrica seeds It is planted extensively for ground cover and soil stabilization near beach areas and other areas subject to erosion. Other uses include paper- making, thatching and weaving into mats and bags. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine. A number of cultivars have been selected for garden use as ornamental plants, including the red-leaved 'Red Baron', also known as Japanese blood grass. Young inflorescences and shoots may be eaten cooked, and the roots contain starch and sugars and are therefore easy to chew. It is used as an ingredient in the skincare brand Kiehl's Ultra Facial Cream for its high concentrations of potassium which provides a hydrating effect. Their website also states that indigenous native Australians may have used the plant as a substitute for salt due to its high saline content. Weed problems The plant has become naturalized in the Americas, Northern Asia, Europe and Africa in addition to many islands and is listed as an invasive weed in some areas. In the U.S. it survives best in the Southeast (and, according to a 2003 survey, has overtaken more acreage in that region than the notorious kudzu),Aggressive weed becoming a menace worse than kudzu , UF researcher says] but has been reported to exist as far north as West Virginia and Oregon. Worldwide it has been observed from 45¬∞N to 45¬∞S. It grows on wet lands, dry lands, areas of high salinity, organic soils, clay soils and sandy soils of pH from 4.0 to 7.5. It prefers full sun but will tolerate some shade. In Florida I. cylindrica is found in areas where the soil has been disturbed, such as roadsides, building sites, timber harvesting areas, and borrow pits. It is able to invade both moist and dry upland pine forests. Once established it often forms dense monocultures. In addition to outcompeting species for resources, the grass also exhibits allelopathic tendencies. The chemicals it releases as well as the dense mat of vegetation that usually accompanies a cogongrass invasion gives it an advantage over indigenous plants. It spreads both through small seeds, which are easily carried by the wind, and rhizomes which can be transported by tilling equipment and in soil transport. In the Southeastern United States, state governments have various eradication efforts in place, and deliberate propagation is prohibited by some authorities. Control is typically by the use of herbicides. Currently, the most effective herbicides used to control growth are glyphosate and imazapyr. Burnoff is seldom successful since the grass burns at a high temperature causing heat damage to trees which would ordinarily be undamaged by a controlled burn and recovers from a burn quickly. Quarantine and extermination of this plant is especially difficult because cogongrass establishes root systems as deep as four feet, and regrowth can be triggered by rhizome segments as small as one inch. Cogongrass is difficult to contain mainly because it is highly adaptive to harsher environments, establishing itself on soils low in fertility. The grass also can grow on sand and clay, and consumers of it are few. The grass tends to be averse to dense shade, but reports indicate more shade-tolerant strains are developing. The legume vine Mucuna pruriens is used in the countries of Benin and Vietnam as a biological control for Imperata cylindrica.  Taxonomy  Imperata cylindrica was first described by Linnaeus in 1759 under the basionym Lagurus cylindricus.Wunderlin, R. P., and B. F. Hansen. 2008. Imperata cylindrica.

Established by Peter the Great and completed in 1727, the Kunstkammer Building hosts the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (), with a collection of almost 2,000,000 items. It is located on the Universitetskaya Embankment in Saint Petersburg, facing the Winter Palace. History Kunstkamera in 1740 The Kunstkamera was established by Peter the Great on the Neva Riverfront. The turreted Petrine Baroque building of the Kunstkamera designed by Georg Johann Mattarnovy was completed by 1727. The foundation stone for the Kunstkammer was laid in 1719. The name Kunstkamera is derived from German Kunstkammer, literally meaning \\"Art chamber\\". Peter's museum was a cabinet of curiosities dedicated to preserving \\"natural and human curiosities and rarities\\", a very typical type of collection in the period. The tsar's personal collection, originally stored in the Summer Palace, features a large assortment of human and animal fetuses with anatomical deficiencies, which Peter had seen in 1697 visiting Frederick Ruysch and Levinus Vincent. The underlying idea of their kunstkammers was to acquire full knowledge of the world. The Dutch word \\"kunst-kamer\\" seems to be introduced by the surgeon Stephanus Blankaart in 1680. The Kunstkamera of Peter the Great is often seen as a haphazard collection of incoherent rarities, but it seems they were collected systematically subject to a well defined plan. Peter's main interest was in \\"naturalia\\", rather than the so- called \\"artificialia\\". Peter encouraged research of deformities, all along trying to debunk the superstitious fear of monsters. He issued an ukase ordering malformed, still-born infants to be sent from all over the country to the imperial collection. He subsequently had them put on show in the Kunstkamera as examples of accidents of nature.Driessen-Van het Reve, J.J. (2006) De Kunstkamera van Peter de Grote.

In 1716, Peter established the mineral cabinet of Kunstkamera, depositing there a collection of 1195 minerals which he had bought from Gotvald, a Danzig doctor. The collection was enriched with Russian minerals. It was a predecessor of the Fersman Mineralogical Museum, now based in Moscow. Many items were bought in Amsterdam from pharmacologist Albertus Seba (1716) and anatomist Frederik Ruysch (1717) and formed the basis for the Academy of Sciences. The Kunstkamera was specially built to house these two extensive collections. A third acquisition came from Jacob de Wilde, a collector of gems and scientific instruments. Head-physician to the czar, Robert Erskine, and his secretary Johann Daniel Schumacher were responsible for the acquisition.Driessen-Van het Reve, J.J. (2006) De Kunstkamera van Peter de Grote.

Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography In the 1830s, the Kunstkamera collections were dispersed to newly established imperial museums, the most important being the Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography, established in 1879. It has a collection approaching 2,000,000 items and has been known as the Peter the Great Museum since 1903 (in order to distinguish the older museum from the Russian Museum of Ethnography). Originally, there were separate museums for anthropology and ethnography, but on 5 December 1878 it was decided to merge them into a single museum with Leopold Schrenk being appointed on 10 November 1879. It was not until 1887 that the museum was finally provided with its own exhibition premises attached to Kunstkamera in Tamozhennyi pereulok. On 23 September 1889, the first exhibition of the unified Museum was opened. One of the most gruesome exhibits is the head of Willem Mons, brother of Anna Mons. In 1747 some objects were lost in a fire. The museum houses 78 watercolours by the Peruvian artist Pancho Fierro, the largest collection outside Peru. These were brought back by Schrenk following his visit there in 1854.

The overall style of letter depends on the relationship between the parties concerned. Business letters can have many types of content, for example to request direct information or action from another party, to order supplies from a supplier, to point out a mistake by the letter's recipient, to reply directly to a request, to apologize for a wrong, or to convey goodwill. A business letter is sometimes useful because it produces a permanent written record, and may be taken more seriously by the recipient than other forms of communication.Guffey, Rhodes and Rogin.

Font formatting  No special character or font formatting is used, except for the subject line, which is usually underlined.  Punctuation  The salutation or greeting is generally followed by a comma in British style, whereas in the United States a colon is used in formal contexts and a comma otherwise. The valediction or closing is followed by a comma.  Form  The following is the general format, excluding indentation used in various formats: [SENDER'S COMPANY NAME] [SENDER'S ADDRESS (optional if placed at bottom)] [SENDER'S PHONE] [SENDER'S E-MAIL (optional)] [DATE] [RECIPIENT W/O PREFIX] [RECIPIENT'S COMPANY] [RECIPIENT'S ADDRESS] (Optional) Attention [DEPARTMENT/PERSON] Dear [RECIPIENT W/ PREFIX] [First Salutation then Subject in Business letters] [CONTENT] [CONTENT] [COMPLIMENTARY CLOSING (Sincerely, Respectfully, Regards, etc.)] [SENDER] [SENDER'S TITLE (optional)] [SENDER'S ADDRESS (optional if placed at top)] Enclosures ([NUMBER OF ENCLOSURES])  Indentation formats  Business letters conform to generally one of six indentation formats: standard, open, block, semi-block, modified block, and modified semi-block. Put simply, \\"semi-\\" means that the first lines of paragraphs are indented; \\"modified\\" means that the sender's address, date, and closing are significantly indented.  Standard  The standard-format letter uses a colon after the salutation and a comma after the complimentary closing.  Open  The open-format letter does not use punctuation after the salutation and no punctuation after the complimentary closing.  Block  In a block-format letter, all text is left aligned and paragraphs are not indented.  Modified block  In a modified-block format letter, all text is left aligned (except the author's address, date, and closing), paragraphs are not indented, and the author's address, date, and closing begin at the center point. company name and address date TO  Semi-block  Semi-block format is similar to the Modified block format, except that the first line of each paragraph is indented.  Modified semi-block  In a modified semi- block format letter, all text is left aligned (except the author's address, date, and closing), paragraphs are indented, and the author's address, date, and closing are usually indented in the same position.

He is a lawyer who lives in the Upper West Side of New York City with his best friend, Grace Adler (Debra Messing). The series also portrays his relationship with the two other main characters, Karen Walker (Megan Mullally) and Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes). Fictional character history Will was born on October 23, 1966, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, to WASP parents Marilyn (Blythe Danner) and George Truman (Sydney Pollack). He has two brothers, Paul (Jon Tenney) and Sam (John Slattery in the first season, Steven Weber in the eighth). Will and Grace met in college and began dating, while Will was in denial about being gay. He came out in 1985, when ‚Äî after being accused of living in denial by then-acquaintance Jack McFarland ‚Äî he found himself attracted to a poster of Kevin Bacon. Will then realized that his relationship with Grace masked his true sexuality. He and Grace had a fight after Will came out to her -- after proposing marriage to her in a desperate means of avoiding sex -- and did not speak to each other for a year. Eventually, however, they reconciled and became inseparable best friends. After graduating from Columbia University and NYU School of Law, he started working for a successful law firm on track to make partner, but decided to quit and start his own practice. His practice folds in the show's second season after his main client Harlin Polk (Gary Grubbs) fires him, and he begins working for the law firm Doucette & Stein (Doucette played by Gregory Hines and Stein played by Gene Wilder), where he remains until the end of the seventh season, when he quits to do something more meaningful with his life. Will's next job is working for the mysterious Malcolm (Alec Baldwin), but that comes to an end when Malcolm reveals that he is an FBI agent. In the eighth season, Will takes a job at the Coalition of Justice, a business providing legal support for people who cannot afford it. He ultimately returns to Doucette & Stein, taking back his old job after being offered a partnership by his new boss at the firm, Margo (Lily Tomlin). In the ninth season, after being promoted to senior partner, Will finally quits from the firm for good after realizing that this is not what he wants, and partners with Grace at Grace Adler Designs. In the tenth season, Will works as a part-time law professor at New York University, before eventually securing a full-time position midway through the season. In season 11, Will decides to have a child. He hires a surrogate named Jenny (Demi Lovato) to carry his baby. Relationships=Grace Adler Will and Grace have been best friends since college. They dated in 1985, before Will realized he was gay; after he came out to her, she was so hurt that they didn't speak for a year, but they eventually reconciled and became inseparable best friends. They move in together after Grace breaks up with her fianc√© Danny and live together for a year. At the beginning of the second season, Grace moves out, albeit only across the hall. They are on-and-off roommates for the rest of the series. Their relationship is somewhat codependent, with each basing the future of every romantic relationship on whether the other approves. Other characters in the series, particularly Jack and Karen, often compare their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage. In the fifth season, Will and Grace decide to have a baby together through in vitro fertilization. The process is repeatedly delayed through a series of mishaps, however, and Grace changes her mind after she begins dating Leo Markus (Harry Connick, Jr.), whom she marries later in the season. Will is hurt that she does not want to have a baby with him, and the ensuing argument nearly ruins their friendship. Eventually, however, they both realize that they just want the other to be happy, and reconcile. Will and Grace become roommates again in the sixth season when Grace admits her marriage to Leo is deteriorating, and Will supports her in the seventh season when she decides to get a divorce from Leo for cheating on her. In the eighth season, Grace finds out she is pregnant with Leo's child after a chance encounter with him, and she and Will plan on raising the child together. In the series finale, however, Grace has a nightmare that the two will become miserable and resentful from raising the child, and thus reunites with Leo when he proposes to her again. Will feels betrayed and ends their friendship. They do not see each other again for two years. By the time they reconcile, they both have their own families, and they find that they have no time for each other. They drift apart, until 16 years later, when they meet again while helping their children move into the same college dorm. Will's son, Ben (Ben Newmark), and Grace's daughter, Lila (Maria Thayer), begin dating and eventually marry, and Will and Grace once again become close friends. When the series was revived in 2017, the events of the original 2006 finale were retconned. While Grace and Leo did remarry, they never had any children and are going through a divorce. Grace moves back in with Will while her divorce is being finalized. When Grace gets pregnant in the 11th season, Will plans to raise their children with her, and they eventually buy a house together in Upstate New York. In the series finale, Grace goes into labor as they are packing up the apartment, and Will leaves with her, Jack, and Karen to go the hospital. Jack McFarland Will and Jack meet in 1985, and Jack sees immediately that Will is gay. Jack helps Will come out and find the confidence to start dating men, and the two become best friends. That closeness does not prevent them from trading insults with each other at virtually every opportunity: Will makes fun of Jack's promiscuity, effeminate behavior and perpetual unemployment, while Jack mocks Will's stagnant love-life and enjoys calling Will \\"fat and bald\\" (which he clearly isn't). However, on several occasions Jack has confessed his love for Will, and it is occasionally suggested that Jack is attracted to him. Jack is often portrayed sponging off of Will, who pays half of his rent, gives him money to pay his back taxes, and foots the bill for clothes and meals. Karen Walker In the beginning of the series, Will has an antagonistic relationship with Grace's assistant Karen Walker; she makes fun of his sexuality, while he mocks her alcoholism and vain, spoiled demeanor. They warm up to each other somewhat after Will becomes Karen's lawyer, although they continue to mock each other ruthlessly. Throughout the series' run, however, Karen has expressed concern for him and has even offered her friendship, albeit in her own sarcastic fashion. In one eighth-season episode, they get drunk together and bond over their troubles, while still bantering incessantly. She also comforts him at his father's funeral. In the series finale, Will and Karen are portrayed as still being friends 18 years in the future. Romances Will has had romantic relationships with three women: Claire (Megyn Price), his high school girlfriend; Grace, whom he dated in college; and Diane (Mira Sorvino), with whom he had a one-night stand after he and Grace broke up. However, Diane is the only woman Will has ever had sex with. At the beginning of the series, Will's most successful relationship was with his long-term boyfriend Michael (Chris Potter/Cheyenne Jackson), whom he was with from 1989 to November 1996. They briefly reconcile in 2018, but Will ends it once more after realizing that Michael is manipulative and controlling. In the seventh season, he enters into a serious relationship with NYPD officer Vince D'Angelo (Bobby Cannavale). They break up after Vince, who loses two consecutive jobs because he can't resist trying on gloves while on duty, needs to take some time off for himself from their relationship. The two reunite during the funeral of Will's father in season eight and are shown to be raising a son together, Ben Truman, after the series' time-jump in the 2006 series finale. Nearly twenty years later, Ben, who was conceived through in vitro fertilization with a surrogate, goes off to college and meets Grace's daughter, Laila Markus, whom he would eventually marry. In the 2017 revival of the series, the events of the original 2006 finale were retconned. In the new continuity, Will and Vince were together for five years. They never had children, as it was revealed that Ben and the series' original time-jump were figments of Karen's imagination. Vince visits Will and informs him that he is getting married and invites him to his wedding ceremony. Will tries to be happy for Vince, but is secretly insecure, not knowing why their relationship ended. When Will shows up at the wedding and his toasts at the reception end up being condescending, Vince reveals that they broke up because Will criticized everything he did and did not really appreciate him. Vince and Will then manage to patch things up somewhat, Will assuring Vince he is not making a mistake with his marriage and the two fondly reminiscing about the time they had together. In the 10th season, Will begins dating McCoy Whitman (Matt Bomer), a famous news anchor. Although they have problems at first due to McCoy's insecurity and Will's fear of commitment, they eventually move in together, and Will finally proposes to him during Jack's wedding. In the season 11 premiere, they get into a discussion about having children and start making plans to adopt. However, several episodes later, McCoy changes his mind and admits to Will that he is not ready to have children and needs to break off their engagement if this becomes a problem for them. This prompts Will to break up with him so he can continue with his adoption plans. In the series finale, however, Will and McCoy get back together. Family Will comes from a wealthy, but dysfunctional, family of Connecticut WASPs. His relationship with his parents is complicated, particularly with his father, who is uncomfortable with his son's sexuality. In season eight, the two have a fight in which George confesses that he wishes Will wasn't gay. A few days later, having not spoken with Will since the fight, George dies of a heart attack. Will is devastated, but learns from the tragedy to be more open about his feelings, especially with people he loves. He was once very close to his brother Sam, but they stopped speaking to each other following a fight over Sam's marriage (Will disliked Sam's wife). They do not see each other for five years after that, until, in the first-season episode \\"Big Brother is Coming\\", Grace engineers a chance meeting and forces them to talk out their problems. They have another fight in the following episode when Will finds out that Sam and Grace slept together, but they eventually repair their relationship. Reception The character met with a mixed reception from critics; some applauded him for not conforming to gay stereotypes, while others criticized him as a safe version of a gay man designed to be more palatable to heterosexual viewers. Nevertheless, McCormack won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series in 2001 for his performance.

His engines were to become famous for their use in rocket-powered aircraft--notably the Me 163 Komet--but most of his early efforts were spent on systems for submarine propulsion. In these cases the hydrogen peroxide was reduced chemically and the resulting gases used to spin a turbine at about 20,000 rpm, which was then geared to a propeller. This allowed the submarine to run underwater at all times, as there was no need for air to run the engines. The system also used up tremendous amounts of fuel, and any boat based on the design would either have to be huge or have limited range. Thus the system saw only limited development even though a prototype was running in 1940. But when problems with the existing U-boat designs became evident in 1942, the work was stepped up. Eventually two engineers identified a solution to the problem.uboat.net Elektroboot Instead of running the submarine entirely on the perhydrol, they used it just for bursts of speed. Most of the operations would then be carried out as with a normal boat, using a diesel engine to charge batteries. However while a conventional design would use the diesel as the primary engine and the batteries for short periods of underwater power, in this case the boat would run almost all the time on batteries in a low-speed cruise, turning on the perhydrol during attacks. The diesel was now dedicated entirely to charging the batteries, which it needed only three hours to do.youtube, Type XXI Elektroboat U-Boat Wunderwaffe \\"Wonder Weapon\\" The perhydrol design suffered from several design flaws which were not fixed before the end of the war. As an intermediate solution, the perhydrol propulsion system was dropped in favour of a conventional diesel/electric solution, but retaining the streamlined hull-shape. The battery capacity was increased significantly along with fuel stores, and the boat was designed to operate underwater for long periods.militaryfactory.com, Elektroboat Electric U-boats The result was the \\"Elektroboot\\" series, the Type XXI U-boat and a short range Type XXIII U-boat, finalized in January 1943 but with production only commencing in 1944‚Äì1945. When under water, the Type XXI managed to run at , which was faster than a Type VII running full out on the surface and almost as fast as the ships attacking her. After the war, tests carried out by the United States Navy on two captured Type XXIs showed they could outrun some ASW ships by going in the direction of heavy seas. (The US Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, , used a modified Type XXI hull shape.) For most of the trip it ran silently underwater on batteries, surfacing only at night, and then only to snorkel depth. Weapons were likewise upgraded, with automated systems allowing the torpedo tubes to be reloaded in less than one-fourth of the time, firing homing torpedoes that would attack on their own. Even the interior was improved: it was much larger and fitted with showers and a meat refrigerator for long patrols. The design was to be produced in two versions, primarily the Type XXI, and lesser numbers of the smaller Type XXIII. Both were much larger and more difficult to build than the existing designs, the Type XXI taking some 18 months. Mass production of the new type did not really get started until 1944 and subsequently only one combat patrol was carried out by a Type XXI before the war ended. This patrol is considered controversial. According to some sources, the U-2511 did not make any contact with the enemy. Another version suggests that the U-boat did make a contact with of the Royal Navy, but did not fire as the captain had already received orders of surrender. A number of boats were commissioned into Allied navies after the war for research purposes, and one into the Bundesmarine of post-war Germany.

The experiment was the first to successfully show that food could taste different depending on changes in sound. In the experiment, Spence demonstrated that the pitch and volume of the noise made when biting into Pringles chips affected people's perception of how fresh they were. Louder, higher-pitched crunch noises were rated by eaters to be 15% fresher on average than softer, lower-pitched crunch noises. Since then, his research has established that the sight, touch and sound of food can have large effects on its perceived taste. Other findings include that strawberry mousse is perceived as 10% sweeter when eaten from a white container over a black one, that coffee drunk from white mugs tastes almost two times more intense but only two-thirds as sweet as coffee drunk from a black mug, and that eaters perceive yogurt to be roughly 25% more filling when its plastic container weighs two and a half ounces more.

John Stow mentions various dignitaries buried in the early church in his 1598 Survey of London. They include Richard Chaucer, vintner, said by Stow to be the father of the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. John Milton married his third wife, Elizabeth Minshull, in the church in 1663. The parish registers date from 1558, and are now deposited in the Guildhall Library. Rebuilding after the Great Fire St Mary Aldermary was badly damaged in the Great Fire of London of 1666, although parts of its walls and tower survived.\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p88:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 It was mostly rebuilt by Sir Christopher Wren in a Gothic style. A legacy of ¬£5,000 had been left by one Henry Rogers for the rebuilding of a church, and his widow agreed to use it to fund the reconstruction of St Mary's. According to some sources, she stipulated that the new church should be an exact imitation of the one largely destroyed. The church as rebuilt has an aisled nave, six bays long, with a clerestory. There is a short chancel. The tower is attached to the south west corner of the building, and is entered through a western lobby. It is divided into storeys by string courses; the corners have octagonal turrets, terminating in what George Godwin called \\"carved finials of impure design\\". The nave and aisles are separated by arcades of clustered columns, supporting somewhat flattened Gothic arches. The ceilings are decorated with elaborate plaster fan vaulting.Godwin 1839, p.6 The east wall of the chancel is set askew in relation to the axis of the church. According to Nikolaus Pevsner, St Mary Aldemary is \\"the chief surviving monument of the 17th-century Gothic revival in the City and ‚Äì with Warwick ‚Äì the most important late 17th-century Gothic church in England\\". The parish of the church of St Thomas the Apostle, destroyed in the Great Fire and not rebuilt, was united with that of St Mary's. In 1781 a new organ was installed, built by George England and Hugh Russell. Wartime damage St Mary Aldermary was damaged by German bombs in the London Blitz during the Second World War.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) All the windows were shattered and some plaster fell from the vaulting but the building itself remained intact. Restorations St Mary Aldermary Church Interior The church has been repaired and restored many times over the years. In 1876‚Äì7 there were major changes to the interior: a new oak screen was inserted dividing the church from the lobby; the pews and stalls were replaced, the organ was moved from the western gallery to the chancel; the floor was repaved, new stained glass put into the windows, and a new reredos installed.Daniel 1892, p.234 The latest interior restoration was finished in April 2005, with special attention paid to the plaster ceilings and the memorials on the north wall. A service was held on April 21, 2005 to celebrate the restoration, presided over by Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London. From 2005 until 2009, Father John Mothersole was the priest-in-charge and oversaw much of the restoration work at that time. He was succeeded in 2010 by Reverend Ian Mobsby, initially as curate and then as priest-in-charge, who continues in post at present. The church was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950. Burials *Charles Blount, 5th Baron Mountjoy Current activities In January 2010, the Bishop and Archdeacon of London invited the Moot Community to make their home in St Mary Aldermary. Moot is a Church of England community in the new monastic tradition. Members annually commit to live by a \\"rhythm of life\\", which encompasses spiritual practices such as prayer, meditation and presence, and values such as acceptance, balance, creativity and hospitality. The community is currently in a process of discernment about whether it has a vocation as a Church of England Acknowledged Religious Community. Daily prayer, regular worship services, meditation and discussion groups go on in the church, and the community also hosts conferences and courses on subjects such as justice in economics, conflict resolution or mindfulness. The church hosts regular art exhibitions and installations, and retreat days. It is home to a caf√©, Host, which sells fair trade coffee and goods, and there is a small market of food stalls outside the church on weekdays. Since 2007, the church has been the Regimental Church of the Royal Tank Regiment.

He later served as a Judge of the 13th Judicial Circuit Court of the U.S. state of Alabama. Background Graddick graduated in 1963 from the all-male University Military School in Mobile. The institution was the forerunner of UMS-Wright Preparatory School. In 1967, he received his undergraduate degree from the University of Alabama at Tuscaloosa, where he was a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. In 1970, Graddick obtained his Juris Doctor from the Cumberland School of Law in Birmingham, having been chosen the class president. In 1975, at the age of twenty-eight, he was elected District Attorney of Mobile County. Graddick, who served as Alabama‚Äôs Attorney General from 1979 to 1987, has always been a proponent of the tough on crime mindset and decades to life sentencing policies that have made Alabama's prison system one of the worst human right violators in the US. He wrote Alabama‚Äôs infamous habitual offender law, which punishes people with a life sentence for drug and property crimes. He justified it by referring to all offenders as ‚Äúcareer criminals‚Äù. However, those ‚Äúcareer criminals‚Äù were mostly poor and Afro-american young males, who were sentenced in their late teens or early twenties to a mandatory life without parole for crimes like robbery, theft and burglary. That population has spent decades warehoused in Alabama's notorious and overcrowded prisons. In 2019, the DOJ released a scathing report, citing overcrowding, widespread violence and corruption in Alabama‚Äôs prisons, and gave leaders a deadline to implement changes. Graddick made a career using inflammatory rhetoric about people in the criminal justice system. He infamously promised to ‚Äúfry them until their eyeballs pop out and smoke comes out of their ears.‚Äù He maintains a zealous support for executions, despite known wrongful convictions and an appalling racial disparity on Alabama‚Äôs death row. As Attorney General, he blocked efforts to reduce the prison population and fought against rehabilitative programs. When he ran unsuccessfully for Governor, he promised to make sure Alabama prisons remained brutal for people serving time. ‚ÄúThe next Governor needs to make sure our prisons look more like prisons and less like welcome centers,‚Äù he told a crowd of supporters. After almost 20 years in the private practice of law, he was appointed as circuit judge in 2004 and was elected twice thereafter without opposition. He Served as Presiding Judge for 10 years. After retirement from the State Court Bench, Judge Graddick was appointed Senior Judicial Advisor to the Mayor of Mobile and Director of Courts. In 1966, Graddick married the former Corinne Whiting. The couple has three children, Charles Allen Jr., Herndon Whiting, and Corinne and six grandchildren. 1986 gubernatorial race The 1986 Alabama Democratic primary for governor featured Attorney General Graddick in a heated runoff with then Lieutenant Governor Bill Baxley. Graddick won by a almost ten thousand votes,Graddick Wins Rowdy Alabama Runoff but the state Democratic party ruled that he had violated a party rule by encouraging Republicans to vote in the Democratic primary. The court later instructed the Democratic Party either to hold another election or determine whether the crossover votes affected the outcome of the election. After a Party meeting the Party nominated Baxley. Like Texas, Georgia, and Arkansas, Alabama does not register voters by party. At that time, the Democratic party had never enforced such a rule in any election because Alabama was a one-party state. Many Alabama voters opposed the democratic party hierarchy action and therefore voted in protest against Baxley and for H. Guy Hunt, the Republican nominee. Though he was previously considered a token candidate, Hunt won easily and became the first Alabama Republican governor since Reconstruction.Republicans Celebrate Gubernatorial Gains Hunt's election surprised many, since no living person had witnessed a Republican winning the election for governor of Alabama. The media had paid little attention to the Republican gubernatorial primaries, fully expecting that the GOP nominee would be the next loser in the general election. After the campaign for governor in 1986, Graddick established a statewide law practice. At the request of Governor Hunt in 1991 filled an unexpired one year term as district attorney for Montgomery County. He returned to private practice in 1992. Subsequently, Republican Governor Bob Riley appointed Graddick to fill the post left vacant when Judge William McDermott of the 13th Judicial Circuit Court died in office in May 2004. Graddick was elected in January 2005 to serve a six-year term in the same post. He was selected by his fellow circuit judges to serve as the presiding judge of the 13th Judicial Circuit until his retirement in 2017. Graddick switches parties In 2011, Graddick declared his candidacy for Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, in the Republican primary held on March 13, 2012. Graddick opposed current chief justice, Charles \\"Chuck\\" Malone, and former Chief Justice Roy Moore. Both Graddick and Malone had lobbied Governor Robert J. Bentley for his appointment to replace then Chief Justice Sue Bell Cobb, who stepped down before her term expired. Roy Moore held the chief justiceship from 2001 to 2003, when he was removed from office over the Ten Commandments dispute which received national attention. In a bid to return to his former position, in spite of all the pre-election day polls showing Graddick leading, Moore won nearly 51 percent of the ballots in the 2012 primary, having defeated both Malone and Graddick. Moore faced the Democrat Harry Lyon in the general election scheduled for November 6, 2012, only to be kicked off the ballot by the Democratic Party to be replaced by their hand-picked nominee, Robert Vance. Moore won the seat in the general election.

The flexi disc (also known as a phonosheet, Sonosheet or Soundsheet, a trademark) is a phonograph record made of a thin, flexible vinyl sheet with a molded-in spiral stylus groove, and is designed to be playable on a normal phonograph turntable. Flexible records were commercially introduced as the Eva-tone Soundsheet in 1962,US Trademark for \\"Soundsheets\\" was granted to Eva-Tone Soundsheets, Inc. in 1982. The term was first used in commerce in April 1962. Trademark Serial Number: 73399790, Registration Number: 1258434 and were very popular among children and teenagers and mass-produced by the state publisher in the Soviet government. History Before the advent of the compact disc, flexi discs were sometimes used as a means to include sound with printed material such as magazines and music instruction books. A flexi disc could be moulded with speech or music and bound into the text with a perforated seam, at very little cost and without any requirement for a hard binding. One problem with using the thinner vinyl was that the stylus's weight, combined with the flexi disc's low mass, would sometimes cause the disc to stop spinning on the turntable and become held in place by the stylus. For this reason, most flexi discs had a spot on the face of the disc for a coin, or other small, flat, weighted object to increase the friction with the turntable surface and enforce consistent rotation. If the turntable's surface is not completely flat, it is recommended that the flexi disc be placed on top of a full sized record. In Japan, starting in the early 1960s, Asahi Sonorama published the monthly Asahi Sonorama magazine which included an inserted flexi disc (\\"Sonosheet\\"). Every year between 1963 and 1969, The Beatles made a special Christmas recording which was made into a flexi disc and sent to members of their fan club. While the earlier discs largely contained 'thank you' messages to their fans, the later Christmas flexis were used as an outlet for the Beatles to explore more experimental areas; the 1967 disc, for example, became a pastiche of a BBC Radio show and even included a specially recorded song entitled \\"Christmas Time (Is Here Again).\\" In 1964, the National Geographic Society released Song and Garden Birds of North America which included a 12-sided clear flexidisk, bound alternating with pages giving the titles and birds on the recordings. The work was done by Arthur A. Allen and Peter Paul Kellogg of the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology. The August 1965 issue of National Geographic Magazine included a soundsheet of the funeral of Sir Winston Churchill narrated by David Brinkley. The recording has the sounds of the funeral procession to St. Paul's, a hymn sung by the leaders of the world, and an excerpt of the funeral sermon. Excerpts from various recordings of Churchill's speeches are included. The recording ends with bagpipes accompanying Churchill's coffin to the funeral barge on the Thames, as the public phase of the funeral ends. During the 1970s, MAD magazine included Soundsheets in several special editions. One was a dramatization of \\"Gall in the Family Fare\\", its parody of \\"All in the Family,\\" packaged with MAD Super Special #11 (1973). The Summer 1980 edition of MAD Super Special (published in 1979) featured \\"It's a Super-Spectacular Day\\", a song with eight different versions pressed into eight concentric grooves; which version was played depended on where the needle was dropped onto the disc. Another issue included \\"It's a Gas\\", a song whose lyrics were belches. There was also a \\"Mad Disco\\" special issue containing a Soundsheet. ABBA/Live 77 was a special single-sided promo gold flexi disc given as a bonus to children who sold magazines and books at Christmas for Jultidningsf√∂rlaget, a publishing company using door sales as their main distribution channel. The disc contained excerpts from the Swedish group's recent concert appearance in Australia. A two-sided flexible sheet record of the songs of humpback whales (produced by Roger Payne) was included with the January 1979 issue of National Geographic Magazine. With a production order of 10,500,000 copies, it became the largest single press run of any record at the time. Computer magazines began to provide software in audio form \\"Vinyl Data\\" on flexi discs from June 1979 until 1986. While flexi- discs were usually just used as occasional giveaways, from 1980 to 1982, Flexipop made a speciality of giving away such a disc with each edition. Compact discs and the internet have rendered flexi discs largely obsolete, but gimmick discs are still produced occasionally: Amelia‚Äôs Magazine included a one-sided Libertines flexi of What Katie Did. American manufacturer Eva-Tone, believed to be one of the last manufacturers of flexi discs, stopped production of the product in August 2000. As of December 2010, Pirates Press, an independent record manufacturing company based in San Francisco, California, USA, has started production of flexi discs of various sizes and color. In November 2010 extreme metal magazine Decibel began releasing flexi discs with each issue, starting with the January 2011 issue. The content on the disc features \\"100 percent exclusive songs\\" from artists that have been previously featured in the publication. In 2011 independent London-based record label X-Ray Recordings set up, releasing predominantly limited edition runs of flexidiscs for new bands. Their first release with post-punk band Trogons has now sold out and they continue to release more flexidiscs on a semi-regular bases. In October 2011, the Los Angeles-based record company, Side One Dummy Records, teamed up with Alternative Press to offer a Title Fight flexi disc (containing 2 previously unreleased B-Sides) along with a year of AP subscription as a limited edition offer. Due to manufacturing delays the discs arrived packaged with the November issue of AP magazine in mid December. On April 2, 2012, Third Man Records released 1000 flexi discs tied to blue helium balloons into the air in Nashville, Tennessee. The discs contained the first release of \\"Freedom At 21\\", a track on Jack White's debut solo album, Blunderbuss. It is estimated that fewer than 100 of the discs will ever be found and they will be a valuable collector's item for many years. On April 20, 2012, Domino Recording Company released a zine exclusively for Record Store Day that included five individual, multi-colored flexi-discs, each containing a song by Dirty Projectors, Real Estate, Cass McCombs, John Maus, and Villagers. The Dirty Projectors disc was previewed on April 19 by frontman Dave Longstreth via a YouTube video of him playing the record on a turntable. In 2012 Rookie online magazine released its first hardcopy edition, Rookie Yearbook One, which contained a red flexi disc with two songs written specifically for the site: \\"I Don't Care\\" by Dum Dum Girls and \\"Rookie\\" by Supercute!. In the summer 2013 issue of German fanzine PUNKROCK!, the punk rock band Riots, based in Oslo, Norway, gave away a free 2-track exclusive flexi disc to the 200 odd subscribers of the fanzine. This flexi featured 2 tracks - Riots and We're All Slaves. This was pressed by Pirates Press out of the USA. Shortly before the release of the 2014 Foo Fighters album \\"Sonic Highways\\" some of the pre-orders came with a cover of Two Headed Dog on Flexi- Disk In the summer 2015, PizzaDischi, an independent record manufacturing company based in Italy, has started production of flexi discs too, in collaboration with the European Slimer Records independent label run by Panda Kid members, dedicated to limited and rare edition of worldwide artists. In the Soviet Union Flexi discs were mass-produced from 1964 to 1991 by the Soviet government as inserts in the popular Krugozor magazine for teens. The appearance of the Soviet flexi disc was always the same, vivid blue, and the discs are familiar to virtually anyone who grew up in the Soviet Union and even the post-Soviet era. In 1969 in addition to the successful audio-magazine Krugozor, the government also launched the audio-magazine for children Kolobok, which also consisted of flexi disks. Because of a shortage of vinyl recording material (and official censorship of some Western music) during the Soviet era, bootleg recordings known as Ribs, Bones or roentgenizdat were produced on discarded medical X-ray prints. The musician Stephen Coates of UK band The Real Tuesday Weld has created the X-Ray Audio Project devoted to these.The X-Ray Audio Project an archive of information and examples of Soviet 'roentgenizdat' flexi discs More \\"rock on bones\\" roentgenizdat flexi recordsVitaliev, Vitali, Dancing with String Bags in the Snow, column in Engineering & Technology Magazine, Vol. 9, Iss. 8, September 2014, p.106, The Institution of Engineering and Technology, London Human League track \\"Flexi Disc\\" is also the title of a spoken-word track recorded by electronic band The Human League on a flexi disc which accompanied their 12\\" single \\"The Dignity of Labour\\" in 1978.

There were 6 episodes. It was released in January 2003 in a DVD box-set in the United States through Geneon. The series details the life and history of Nanako Shichigusa, a 16-year-old who works as a maid (not nurse as the title might imply) in the hospital of Dr. Kyogi Ogami, the male lead. Nanako is a classic ditzy slapstick protagonist who tends to accidentally break things and do everything wrong. Ogami treats her frequently in a cruel or heartless manner‚Äîthreatening her, yelling at her and even subjecting her to physical abuse‚Äîyet at the climax of every episode he comes through to rescue her from whatever predicament she got herself into. Much of the series revolves around the relationship between Nanako and Ogami‚Äîhis mean veneer, her faith in him, and how he alternates between the evil mad scientist archetype and the knight in shining armor archetype. As the series progresses we are gradually revealed the history between Nanako and Ogami's family and given a reason why the two are so tightly knit together, as well as why the title refers to Nanako as a \\"nurse\\". A minor supporting cast is introduced, though Nanako and Ogami are clearly the leads. The plot incorporates the American military, the Catholic Church and outlandish science fiction experiments, with these elements progressed mostly in the lead episode and the last two episodes. The middle episodes 2-4 feature mostly unrelated one-shot plots, though minor progress is made in each episode regarding the history between Nanako and Ogami's family. Plot summary In the beginning, Nanako was the subject of a cyborg experiment conducted by Dr. Ogami for one of his most powerful robots. Through rigorous training, Dr. Ogami trained Nanako to withstand the pain. However, he made her too strong, and the plan ultimately failed. However, recent developments between the Pentagon and the Vatican to resurrect Jesus for the Second Coming have landed Nanako as the subject of an operation in which she will give birth to the new Jesus. Throughout the series, we learn that Nanako is, in fact, the third clone in a series of clones cloned from the original Nanako. The original died from a mysterious illness, and an experiment to clone her was successful. However, around the age of 20, each Nanako clone dies of the same mysterious illness that claimed the life of the first Nanako. It has been Dr. Ogami's quest to cure the \\"Nanako illness\\" ever since he promised the second clone that he would heal her before she died when he was young. Mia Ortiz anime and manga to of here in 27th Episode 1: The First Spiral Nanako is doing her usual chore of cooking, but the fish she cooks burns and, before that, breaks a dozen plates that were handed down through the Ogami family, which later makes Dr. Ogami angry at her. This is typical of Dr. Ogami, as Nanako does get into a lot of trouble. She gets mixed up in a fight between Kuron and Komanechi, two old people who reside in the hospital. After running out for a few groceries, she returns to meet Dr. Ogami and the Army. They are conducting an experiment, but she is doing her usual exercises that Dr. Ogami has planned for her. After she finishes, she returns to the experiment, just as it goes haywire. The experiment kills a few officers, and Nanako is sucked into the goo-like monster. She has also caught a cold, so the flu virus helps to weaken the monster as she continuously sneezes. Dr. Ogami rescues Nanako and defeats the monster. The monster freezes and falls apart, ending the disaster. Episode 2: Memories of You Nanako runs through tough training exercises, such as standing under a cold waterfall with nothing but a bikini on, with the help of Genki. Nanako, however, believes she is on vacation. While standing by the fire at night, Nanako cooks fishes. However, when she gives Dr. Ogami one, he gets angry because she forgot to buy daikon radish, which helps the protein in fish digest properly. Nanako gets frustrated, and runs away. While in the woods, she encounters a giant bear after trying to light a fire, and Dr. Ogami reminisces about past Nanakos in the trailer. Nanako runs from the bear in fear as it chases her. Dr. Ogami realizes she is missing and then begins to read a signal coming from a stuffed animal he had given to her. He locates her and saves her from plunging off a cliff. Genki stops the bear from mauling her to death. Nanako, while hanging from Dr. Ogami's hand, which has a hold of her foot, begs for forgiveness, but Dr. Ogami drops her into the river below as punishment. However, Nanako catches a cold and relaxes naked in a hot tub above a fire Kuron built. Dr. Ogami appears with the stuffed animal that had thought by Nanako to have been dropped off the cliff when she was rescued, but, not only is it a tracking device, it is also a recorder. It plays back something Nanako had said about Dr. Ogami behind his back. Dr. Ogami gets angry and Nanako freaks, jumping out of the tub naked and running for her life. Dr. Ogami chases after her with a beating stick experiment. Episode 3: The Psycho Patient Dr. Ogami now has to deal with a patient who has a violent record. He is trying to solve a murder mystery for the police. He performs tests on him, while Kaoru Satsuki teases him. This causes him to become nervous. He also constantly stares as Nanako, as if she is of importance to him. He turns into a \\"Hyde\\" monster and wreaks havoc on the Ogami Hospital. Many attempts of falsely torturing Nanako, including stripped her down to only her panties and being tortured by Kuron, hanging her above a boiling pot of goo, topless with only nipple shields to cover her big breasts in a torture ritual, and a near-lesbian scene where Satsuki tries to \\"make her into a real woman,\\" all fail. They attempt to shoot tranquilizers into the monster to stop it, but all fail, and, in turn, make everyone else except Dr. Ogami go to sleep. While cornered outside in the rain by the monster, Nanako is saved by Dr. Ogami, who manages to put it to sleep. The next day, Nanako goes over to Satsuki's room, hoping to ask her about \\"making her a real woman\\", but not the way Nanako thought. However, Nanako caught Satsuki at a bad moment... without her makeup on! Episode 4: Fire-Crackers In her sleep, Nanako is fitted with a special suit which enables her to be a war machine. She can fly, shoot rockets, and fire bullets with the suit. She awakes to find herself in an exhibit showcasing the suit she is wearing. During her display, in which only Satsuki can control, she is stopped by a robot named Griffith, which also destroys tanks and people in the process. Inside, a man named Alan Mizuki claims she is a cyborg named Nana-Go, which was shown to him by Dr. Ogami in their early days in college together. The once-friend of Dr. Ogami has now become his biggest rival, after sabotaging an attempt to revive one of his loves, Jamie. Nanako pleads that she is not a cyborg, but a human. Mizuki refuses to listen, and still believes she is a cyborg, because she cannot take the suit off. Griffith is then released on her in combat, and eventually destroys half of the hospital. However, Mizuki drops the remote that controls Griffith, and that actives a mode which attacks anything that moves. While frozen, they try to figure out a way to retrieve the remote. When a rock falls from the ceiling, Griffith attacks it, giving them time to dash to the remote. Yet, their plans are foiled when a rock falls upon the remote and Griffith destroys it, destroying the remote also. It goes haywire and fires at everything in sight. Nanako is caught in the middle, and is forced to defeat the robot. She picks the robot up and throws it into the distance, defeating it, but also setting off a self-destruct sequence. It explodes, destroying Ogami Hospital. Outside, in plain view of the wreckage, Nanako soon realizes her suit is running low on battery power. The suit soon falls apart, revealing her completely naked to Mizuki, proving to him she is not a cyborg. She realizes what happened and covers herself. Mizuki is then carried away by authorities, but Jamie rescues him on the way to jail by self- destructing herself. At the end, Dr. Ogami returns from seeing his father to see that the hospital is in ruins. Episode 5: The Last Spiral, Part 1 Another attempt to revive Jesus fails. Nanako and Dr. Ogami steal a plane, but Nanako, once again, believes she is going on vacation. The operation to begin the revival of the second Jesus is beginning, and she is on her way there. The government is about to find out Nanako's secret, and almost find out by going to what remains of the hospital. However, they are saved by a task force. The people who lived in the hospital are the ones who figures out that Nanako is a clone. While in the air, a \\"hijacker\\" tries to stop them, but fails, mostly because the plane is attacked by fighter jets. In the process, an engine aboard the plane explodes after being hit from one of the jets, making flight almost impossible. So, Nanako is ordered to remove all that she can from within the plane. It fails, and she also, in vain, removes a few articles of her clothing to also help. Yet, Dr. Ogami and Nanako exit the plane, and at the very end, Nanako's bra falls off and into the air. Episode 6: The Last Spiral, Part 2 Nanako and Dr. Ogami float to safety, and so begins the operation. They strip Nanako down and tie her up to begin the procedure. Dr. Ogami participates, but is really there to sabotage the entire experiment (not to mention cure Nanako). Before putting her under, Dr. Ogami tells Nanako that he called the Army to rescue them. After the first step in the experiment is completed, the Army and Air Force arrives to destroy the area, and the experiment is a complete failure. Another monster goes berserk and starts killing people left and right, including the head of the experiment, Griffin. Saint, however, escapes with the information about the experiment, hoping to sell it to the highest bidder. Dr. Ogami and Nanako escape into a river and wind up near a waterfall. Dr. Ogami dreams of the past Nanako and himself falling in love, and the past Nanako encourages him. Nanako and Dr. Ogami are eventually saved by the rest of the gang. However, after returning to the base, it is revealed that Dr. Ogami was to be assigned to SkyLab 5, the newest orbital space station. Realizing that the assignment was really a means to hide him, Dr. Ogami refuses, stating that he will not work anywhere that doesn't have fish. After the Army offers to send up as much fish as he wants, Dr. Ogami adds that he prefers grated radish on his fish. After the Army agreed to this request, Dr. Ogami finally stipulated that only one person is allowed to grill the fish and grate the radish... Nanako! When she realized what Dr. Ogami meant, Nanako groaned in discouragement. Reception On Anime News Network, Mike Crandol gave it an overall grade of D+.

She has starred in numerous films and several television series, most memorably in Wong Kar-wai's internationally acclaimed 1994 feature, Chungking Express, which earned her a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the 14th Hong Kong Film Awards. A former Miss Hong Kong runner-up (1991), she is also the first Chinese model to be signed by US cosmetics company Revlon in 1998. Since 2003, she has worked primarily as a fashion publicist and in 2010, opened Mama Kid, a children's designer concept store in Hong Kong. In 2018, she made a surprising return to acting, starring in the film Prison Architect by renowned Chinese visual artist Cao Fei. The film was commissioned by Tai Kwun, the Centre for Heritage and Arts in Hong Kong, and screened at the 69th Berlin International Film Festival as part of their Forum Expanded programme. Life and career=1970-93: Early life and Miss Hong Kong Pageant Chow was born and raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, the only child to an upper-middle-class family. Her father was a property developer whom she describes as \\"tough, direct, and self- disciplined.\\" Chow had spent some of her teens in Hong Kong during the mid-80s where she attended Marymount Secondary School and completed Form-5. She described these years as having been \\"difficult\\" and \\"stressful,\\" and had initially returned to Vancouver before moving to Hong Kong a second time in the summer of 1991. It was then that she joined the 1991 Miss Hong Kong Pageant, in which she placed first runner-up and made her entry into the entertainment industry. Following a brief study break where she studied Law at the University of Hong Kong, Chow began her career in late 1992 as a television presenter for the lifestyle programme, Eye on Hong Kong on TVB Pearl. Her first film credit was a cameo in Peter Chan's He Ain't Heavy, He's My Father, released in December 1993. 1994-97: Hong Kong films As a newcomer, she drew considerable controversy for her role in the Category-III box office hit Twenty Something, which dealt with sexually explicit themes considered shocking for a former Miss Hong Kong beauty queen. Her following role in Wong Kar-Wai's widely acclaimed Chungking Express also made an impression and garnered her a Hong Kong Film Award nomination. Her career took a sharp turn when she played the role of a \\"homewrecker\\" in a hugely popular television series. The role was ill-received and the image of seductress came to be closely associated with Chow, perhaps further fuelled by earlier rumours of her alleged affair with Tony Leung Chiu Wai (then already dating long-time partner Carina Lau), whose music videos and album cover she also featured in. In the subsequent period between 1995‚Äì97, she was cast in a string of B-movies, usually in the role of a villain. The more notable of these were that of the female terrorist in Jing Wong's High Risk, a moderately successful box-office hit, and a guest appearance in Tsui Hark's acclaimed wu-xia feature The Blade. 1997‚Äì99: Hollywood and Revlon In late 1996, she left the Hong Kong film industry to pursue a career in Hollywood, adopting a more racially ambiguous screen name, Rachel Shane. She was signed to the William Morris Agency and had a small part in the film Phantoms which starred Peter O'Toole and Ben Affleck. More substantially, she became the first Chinese spokesmodel for Revlon US in 1998, appearing in national print and tv ad campaigns alongside Halle Berry, Salma Hayek, and Melanie Griffith. She is to be followed by Lucy Liu. 2000‚Äì02: Career Transition, Part-time Actor Chow eventually returned to Hong Kong in 2000, where she joined the media communications department at Lane Crawford, although continued to act part- time. The following year saw her return to the small screen in the ATV series, Healing Hearts, in which she played the role of a lawyer. The role briefly revived her career, leading to several magazine covers and an ad campaign with Neutrogena Hong Kong. She also starred alongside Leslie Cheung in Inner Senses (2002), which was to be Cheung's last film. 2003‚Äìpresent: Fashion publicist, entrepreneur Since 2003, Chow has, for the most part, left the entertainment industry. For the next seven years, she would continue to work as publicist for the Pedder Group, the shoes and accessories division of Lane Crawford. Looking back on her career in 2010, Chow remarks: > \\"I worked for the group for 10 years. I rounded off this experience as vice- > president, marketing. I met larger-than-life individuals who left an > impression. Highlights included working with [American filmmaker] David > Lynch and [footwear designer] Christian Louboutin at Cafe de Flore, in > Paris, and producing the first Guy Bourdin exhibition in Hong Kong. I am > also proud of the fact that I'm well known in the fashion industry for > producing some of the best store window displays in Central. I think more > people have seen or admired my window displays than have watched my films.\\" Chow's most recent acting credit was a TV series filmed in mid-2004, but never aired until December 2010, more than six years after filming completed. In September 2010, Chow opened Mama Kid, a children's clothing boutique in Hong Kong's Central District to great success, which has since relocated to Stanley. Chow married Darryl Goveas, a Hong Kong-based Belgian-Indian interior designer in 2005, with whom she has a daughter.

A pairing would usually not apply for critical votes, such as no-confidence votes. The member abstaining from voting is referred to as a pair. In the United States, pairing is an informal arrangement between members and the pairs are called live pairs. An alternative method of maintaining the relative voting positions of parties in a legislative body is proxy voting, which is not commonly used, but is used, for example, in New Zealand.New Zealand House of Representatives Standing Orders, sections 155-156. Examples=Australia In Australia, following the 2010 federal election, the Gillard Government formed a minority government with the support of a number of votes from minor parties and independents, and the Opposition refused to grant automatic pairing,news.com.au, 28 Sept 2010: Tony Abbott gets tough on pair for Julia GillardThe Australian, 29 Sept 2010: Tony Abbott puts federal ministers under virtual house arrest leading to some embarrassment and reversals for the Opposition when, for example, a pair was initially not given for a member to care for her sick babyMichelle Rowland granted pair to care for sick baby or to attend at the birth of his baby.Sydney Morning Herald, 9 Sept 2011:Abbott agrees to pair for Thomson A pair has also been granted to minor party legislators. Greens Senator Scott Ludlam, for example, was given a government pair when absent from the Senate in late 2016 because of mental health issues. The pairing system was abused in Victoria in March 2018 when the Labor Government granted pairs to two Opposition MPs in the upper house, but who then unexpectedly returned to the chamber, while the government pairs were absent, to vote down an important government bill.Labor's fire service rejig goes pear-shaped after paired pair reappear Canada The 1926 Canadian election was called when Arthur Meighen's three-day-old Conservative government was defeated 96‚Äì95 on a motion of confidence, when an opposition MP who was paired with an absent Tory voted against the government, later stating that he had forgotten that he was a pair. In 2005, Paul Martin's Liberal government faced a confidence vote. NDP MP Ed Broadbent, who planned to vote in support of the government, abstained from voting so that independent MP Chuck Cadman, who planned to vote against the government but was sick, could stay at home. The Liberals narrowly won the vote, with the Speaker breaking the tie.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/civility-thats-the- word/article1330460/  Sweden  Pairing in the Swedish Riksdag is a voluntary agreement run by appointed members of most of the represented political parties, called Kvittningspersoner. The system is intended to enable MPs to abstain from votes for electorate events, study trips etc, without affecting the likely outcome of the vote. United Kingdom In 1976, the Conservatives broke off pairing, after accusing the Labour whips of bringing in an MP who was paired off to vote on the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries bill; on 27 May of that year, a division on a Tory amendment to the bill tied 303‚Äì303, leading to the Speaker making a casting vote against it; on a procedural matter relating to the bill following immediately after, Labour won the division 304‚Äì303. Incensed Tory MPs accused the government of cheating on the vote, leading to physical altercations in the Commons, Shadow Minister for Industry Michael Heseltine famously removing the House of Commons mace and swinging around in the chamber, and the Speaker declaring the session being suspended as an incident of grave disorder. The Labour whips defended their action, stating that they released junior whip Tom Pendry from the pair when it was discovered that the Minister of Agriculture, Fred Peart, was abroad on a ministerial trip but not paired. In 1979, the government of James Callaghan fell by one vote, partially due to Labour deputy whip Walter Harrison suspending the unspoken obligation of his Conservative counterpart Bernard Weatherill to pair for the terminally ill Labour backbencher Sir Alfred Broughton. Pairing in the British House of Commons was again suspended by a decision of the Labour and Liberal Democrat Chief Whips, Donald Dewar and Archy Kirkwood on 17 December 1996, following an incident when they claimed to find the Conservative government cheating in a vote by pairing the same three Conservative MPs with three absent Labour MPs as well as three absent Liberal Democrat MPs. The pairing system once again came under scrutiny during the 2017‚Äì2019 parliamentary term, when the Conservatives were in power as a minority government. In June 2018, Labour MP Naz Shah attacked the government after Tory whips refused to pair Shah and the heavily pregnant MPs Jo Swinson (Liberal Democrat) and Laura Pidcock (Labour) on an important Brexit vote; Shah was required to attend the debate, despite being in a wheelchair and on a morphine drip for severe nerve pain. Several weeks later, the Conservative chairman, Brandon Lewis, broke a pair with Swinson on several votes on a trade bill‚ÄîSwinson was on maternity leave and held a \\"long-term\\" pair with Lewis‚Äîat the behest of the Chief Whip, Julian Smith. After Labour MP Tulip Siddiq delayed giving birth in January 2019 in order to vote on a crucial Brexit- related division, the House of Commons approved a trial of a proxy voting system for new and expectant parents. United States In the United States Senate and House of Representatives, pairing is referred to as a live pair, which is an informal voluntary agreement between members, not specifically authorized or recognized by House or Senate rules. Live pairs are agreements which members make to nullify the effect of absences on the outcome of recorded votes. If a member expects to be absent for a vote, he or she may \\"pair off\\" with another member who will be present and who would vote on the other side of the question, but who agrees not to vote. The member in attendance states that he or she has a live pair, announces how each of the paired members would have voted, and then votes \\"present.\\" In this way, the other member can be absent without affecting the outcome of the vote. Because pairs are informal and unofficial arrangements, they are not counted in vote totals; however paired members' positions do appear in the Congressional Record. An example of a live pair is the lack of vote by Steve Daines (R-MT) and Present vote of Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) during the final confirmation vote in the Senate of Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Daines was in attendance at his daughter's wedding in Montana at the time of the vote.

The album was released in 1977 in two different versions, comprising a total of 30 songs by the Beatles. The performances were recorded on a home tape machine using a single microphone, resulting in a low fidelity recording. Ted \\"Kingsize\\" Taylor began to investigate possible marketing of the tapes in 1973. The tapes were eventually bought by Paul Murphy and subjected to extensive audio processing to improve the sound, leading to the 1977 album. Although the poor sound quality limits its commercial appeal, the album provides historic insight into the group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania. The Beatles were unsuccessful in legally blocking the initial release of the album; the recordings were reissued in many forms until 1998, when the group were awarded full rights to the performances. History=Background The Beatles' five residencies in Hamburg during 1960 to 1962 allowed the Liverpool band to develop their performance skills and widen their reputation. Drummer Pete Best was added to the band in August 1960 to secure their first Hamburg booking, where they played for 48 nights at the Indra Club and then 58 nights at the Kaiserkeller. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961 to play at the Top Ten Club for three months.Lewisohn (2000), pp. 22, 28, 42. A new Hamburg music venue, the Star-Club, opened on 13 April 1962, with The Beatles booked for the first seven weeks. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in November and December 1962 for their fourth and fifth engagements there, which had been booked for the Star- Club many months in advance. Unlike their previous three trips to Hamburg, their drummer was Starr, having replaced Best in August. The Beatles were reluctant to return for their final two-week booking, which started 18 December, as they were gaining popularity in Britain and had just achieved their first charted single with \\"Love Me Do\\".Lewisohn (2000), pp. 62, 69, 86. Recording Portions of The Beatles' final Star-Club performances (along with other acts) were recorded by the club's stage manager, Adrian Barber, for Ted \\"Kingsize\\" Taylor.Williams (1975), p. 209. Barber used a Grundig home reel-to-reel recorder at a tape speed of 3¬æ inches per second, with a single microphone placed in front of the stage. Taylor, leader of The Dominoes (who were also playing at the club), said that John Lennon verbally agreed to the group being recorded in exchange for Taylor providing the beer during their performances. The tapes were originally described as having been recorded in the spring of 1962, an attempt to pre-date The Beatles' June 1962 contract signing with Parlophone.Unterberger (2006), p. 38. However, song arrangements and dialogue from the tapes pointed to late December 1962,Unterberger (2006), p. 39. and a recording date of 31 December 1962 (the group's last day in Hamburg) was commonly cited.Lewisohn (2000), p. 86. Later researchers have proposed that the tapes are from multiple days during the last week of December;Unterberger (2006), pp. 38‚Äì39. Allan Williams (The Beatles' booking agent at the time) recalled that a total of about three hours was recorded over three or four sessions between Christmas and New Year's Day. The tapes captured The Beatles performing at least 33 different titles, plus some repeated songs.Unterberger (2006), p. 40. Of the 30 songs that were commercially released from the tapes, only two were Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney compositions. The others were an assortment of cover versions, 17 of which would be re-made by The Beatles and appear on their various studio albums or Live at the BBC. The arrangements played at the Star-Club are similar to the versions recorded later, albeit less refined, although there are a few cases with distinct differences. For example, \\"Mr. Moonlight\\" has a much quicker tempo, a guitar-based instrumental break, and an intentionally altered lyric with Lennon proclaiming he is on his \\"nose\\" instead of his \\"knees\\"; \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" was described as \\"never taken at a more breakneck pace\\". The recording equipment and method resulted in the tapes being unmistakably low fidelity. The vocals, even in the best cases, sound \\"somewhat muffled and distant\\". The vocals on a few songs are so indistinct that labelling and liner notes on early releases gave incorrect information about who was singing and the exact song being performed. Much of The Beatles' dialogue between songs is audible, which includes addressing the audience in both English and German, as well as repartee among themselves. The banter is irreverent and coarse at times, an aspect of their stage act that would soon cease under the influence of manager Brian Epstein. Marketing attempts Taylor said he had offered to sell the tapes to Epstein in the mid-1960s, but that Epstein did not consider them to be of commercial value and offered only ¬£20. Taylor said he kept the tapes at home, largely forgotten until 1973 when he decided to look into their marketability. Williams related a different history than Taylor, stating that after Taylor returned to Liverpool, he left the tapes with a recording engineer for editing into a potential album. The project was never finished and the engineer later relocated, with the tapes being among many items left behind. In 1972, Williams, Taylor, and the engineer gained access to the abandoned office and recovered the tapes \\"from beneath a pile of rubble on the floor.\\"Williams (1975), pp. 209‚Äì210. When the existence of the tapes was first publicly reported in July 1973, Williams was planning to ask Apple for at least ¬£100,000.Badman (2003), pp. 108‚Äì109. Williams said he later met with George Harrison and Starr to offer the tapes for ¬£5,000, but they declined, citing financial difficulties at the time.Williams (1975), pp. 210‚Äì212. Williams and Taylor teamed up with Paul Murphy, head of Buk Records, to find an outlet for the tapes. Release Murphy eventually bought the tapes himself and formed a new company, Lingasong, specifically for the project. He sold the worldwide distribution rights to Double H Licensing, which spent more than $100,000 on elaborate audio processing and mixing of the songs under the direction of Larry Grossberg. The sequence of songs was rearranged, and some of the individual songs were edited to bypass flawed tape sections or make up for an incomplete recording. After an unsuccessful attempt by The Beatles to block it, the 26-song Live! at the Star-Club in Hamburg, Germany; 1962 was released by Lingasong. The album first appeared in Germany in April 1977 in association with Bellaphon Records, and was released in the UK the following month.Weiner (1992), p. 61. For the album's June 1977 US release (in association with Atlantic Records), four songs were removed and replaced with four different songs from the tapes.Weiner (1992), pp. 138, 159. Reissues Over the next two decades, the recordings were licensed to several record companies, resulting in numerous releases with varying track selections. In 1979, Pickwick Records performed some additional audio filtering and equalisation of the songs on the Lingasong US version, and released it over two volumes as First Live Recordings; the set included the song \\"Hully Gully\\" that was mistakenly credited to The Beatles,Weiner (1992), p. 139. but was actually performed by Cliff Bennett and the Rebel Rousers, another act on the Star-Club bill.Winn (2008), p. 23. In 1981, Audio Fidelity Enterprises released Historic Sessions in the UK, the first single package with all 30 Beatles tracks from the original Star-Club releases.Weiner (1992), p. 163. Several additional songs from the Star-Club tapes have appeared on Beatles bootleg records over the years. In 1985, a bootlegger known as \\"Richard\\", who had already found infamy by issuing several titles with controversial covers and content, issued his own bootleg version of the Star Club tapes without any of the editing found on the official releases, entitled The Beatles vs. the Third Reich‚Äîdirectly parodying The Beatles vs. the Four Seasons in both name and cover. The release of the recordings on two CDs by industry giant Sony Music in 1991 sparked renewed legal attention by The Beatles (as represented by Paul McCartney, Harrison, Starr, and Yoko Ono). Sony also produced a version specifically for their Columbia House music club, but Sony withdrew the titles in 1992 as a lawsuit was progressing. Lingasong's CD release of the original set prompted another lawsuit from The Beatles in 1996; the case was decided in 1998 in favour of The Beatles, who were granted ownership of the tapes and exclusive rights to their use. Harrison appeared in person to provide evidence in the case, and his testimony was cited as an important factor in the judge's decision. Harrison characterised the claim that Lennon gave Taylor permission for the recording as \\"a load of rubbish\\", and added: \\"One drunken person recording another bunch of drunks does not constitute business deals.\\" Reception The album had limited commercial success, reaching a peak position of No. 111 during a seven-week run on the US Billboard 200 album chart. Assessments of the album often weigh the poor sound quality against the historic importance and insight provided into The Beatles' early stage act. Rolling Stone reviewer John Swenson called the album \\"poorly recorded but fascinating\\" and commented that it showed The Beatles as \\"raw but extremely powerful.\\" Allmusic, commenting on a reissue, wrote: \\"The results were very low-fidelity, and despite The Beatles' enormous success, it took Taylor fifteen years to find someone greedy and shameless enough to release them as a record\\". Q magazine described the recordings as having \\"certain historical interest\\" and remarked: \\"The show seems like a riot but the sound itself is terrible ‚Äì like one hell of a great party going on next door.\\" George Harrison gave the assessment: \\"The Star-Club recording was the crummiest recording ever made in our name!\\"Unterberger (2006), p. 41.

Research and development  It took five years of research under the directorship of Benjamin Hulme, Harvey Christmas, Charles Sumner Tainter and Chichester Bell at the Volta Laboratory to develop and distinguish their machine from Thomas Edison's Phonograph. Among their innovations, the researchers experimented with lateral recording techniques as early as 1881. Contrary to the vertically-cut grooves of Edison Phonographs,Newville, Leslie J.

Retrieved from University of San Diego History Department website December 19, 2009 the lateral recording method used a cutting stylus that moved from side to side in a \\"zig zag\\" pattern across the record. While cylinder phonographs never employed the lateral cutting process commercially, this later became the primary method of phonograph disc recording. Bell and Tainter also developed wax-coated cardboard cylinders for their record cylinder. Edison's grooved mandrel covered with a removable sheet of tinfoil (the actual recording medium) was prone to damage during installation or removal. Tainter received a separate patent for a tube assembly machine to automatically produce the coiled cardboard tube cores of the wax cylinder records. The shift from tinfoil to wax resulted in increased sound fidelity and record longevity. Besides being far easier to handle, the wax recording medium also allowed for lengthier recordings and created superior playback quality.Library and Archives Canada.

Additionally the Graphophones initially deployed foot treadles to rotate the recordings, then wind-up clockwork drive mechanisms, and finally migrated to electric motors, instead of the manual crank on Edison's Phonograph.  Commercialization  In 1885, when the Volta Laboratory Associates were sure that they had a number of practical inventions, they filed patent applications and began to seek out investors. The Volta Graphophone Company of Alexandria, Virginia, was created on January 6, 1886, and incorporated on February 3, 1886. It formed to control the patents and to handle the commercial development of their sound recording and reproduction inventions, one of which became the first Dictaphone.Newville, Leslie J.

After the Volta Associates gave several demonstrations in Washington, D.C., businessmen from Philadelphia created the American Graphophone Company on March 28, 1887, to produce and sell the machines for the budding phonograph marketplace. The Volta Graphophone Company then merged with American Graphophone,Hoffmann, Frank W. & Ferstler, Howard.

Tainter resided there for several months to supervise manufacturing before becoming ill, but later went on to continue his inventive work for many years. The small Bridgeport plant, which initially produced three or four machines a day, later became the Dictaphone Corporation.  Subsequent developments  A 1912 advertisement for the Columbia GrafonolaShortly after American Graphophone creation, Jesse H. Lippincott used nearly $1 million of an inheritance to gain control of it, as well as the rights to the Graphophone and the Bell and Tainter patents. He directly invested $200,000 into American Graphophone, and agreed to purchase 5,000 machines yearly, in return for sales rights to the Graphophone (except in Virginia, Delaware, and the District of Columbia). Soon after, Lippincott purchased the Edison Speaking Phonograph Company and its patents for US$500,000, and exclusive sales rights of the Phonograph in the United States from Ezrah T. Gilliand (who had previously been granted the contract by Edison) for $250,000, leaving Edison with the manufacturing rights. . He then created the North American Phonograph Company in 1888 to consolidate the national sales rights of both the Graphophone and the Edison Speaking Phonograph. Jesse Lippincott set up a sales network of local companies to lease Phonographs and Graphophones as dictation machines. In the early 1890s Lippincott fell victim to the unit's mechanical problems and also to resistance from stenographers, resulting in the company's bankruptcy. A coin-operated version of the Graphophone, , was developed by Tainter in 1893 to compete with nickel-in-the-slot entertainment phonograph demonstrated in 1889 by Louis T. Glass, manager of the Pacific Phonograph Company.How the Jukebox Got its Groove Popular Mechanics, June 6, 2016, retrieved July 3, 2017 In 1889, the trade name Graphophone began to be utilized by Columbia Phonograph Company as the name for their version of the Phonograph. Columbia Phonograph Company, originally established by a group of entrepreneurs licensed by the American Graphophone Company to retail graphophones in Washington DC, ultimately acquired American Graphophone Company in 1893. In 1904, Columbia Phonograph Company established itself in Toronto, Canada. Two years later, in 1906, the American Graphophone company reorganized and changed its name to Columbia Graphophone Company to reflect its association with Columbia. In 1918, Columbia Graphophone Company reorganized to form a retailer, Columbia Graphophone Company‚Äîand a manufacturer, Columbia Graphophone Manufacturing Company. In 1923, Louis Sterling bought Columbia Phonograph Co. and reorganized it yet again, giving birth to the future record giant Columbia Records.Patmore,David.

Early machines compatible with Edison cylinders were modified treadle machines. The upper-works connected to a spring or electric motor (called Type K electric) in a boxy case, which could record and play back the old Bell and Tainter cylinders. Some models, like the Type G, had new upper-works that were not designed to play Bell and Tainter cylinders. The name Graphophone was used by Columbia (for disc machines) into the 1920s or 1930s, and the similar name Grafonola was used to denote internal horn machines.

Arnaut de MareuilHis name has many variations: Maruelh, Marolh, Marol, Maroill, Maruoill, or Meruoill. (fl. late 12th century) was a troubadour, composing lyric poetry in the Occitan language. Twenty-five, perhaps twenty-nine, of his songs, all cansos, survive, six with music. According to Hermann Oelsner's contribution to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Arnaut de Mareuil surpassed his more famous contemporary Arnaut Daniel in \\"elegant simplicity of form and delicacy of sentiment\\". This runs against the consensus of both past and modern scholars: Dante, Petrarch, Pound and Eliot, who were familiar with both authors and consistently proclaim Daniel's supremacy His name indicates that he came from Mareuil-sur-Belle in P√©rigord. He is said to have been a \\"clerk\\" from a poor family who eventually became a jongleur; he settled at the courts of Toulouse and then B√©ziers. He apparently loved the countess Azalais, daughter of Raymond V of Toulouse, married to Roger II Trencavel, and Arnaut's surviving poems may be seen as a sequence (lyric cycle) telling of his love. Alfonso II of Aragon was his rival for Azalais's affections, and according to the raz√≥ to one of Arnaut's poems, the king jealously persuaded her to break off her friendship with Arnaut. He fled to Montpellier, where he found a patron in count William VIII. Arnaut's cantaire (singer) and jongleur (minstrel, messenger) was Pistoleta. References *Biographies des troubadours, ed. J.

He famously marched on Kamakura, besieging and capturing it from the H≈çj≈ç clan in 1333. Later he fought the Takauji brothers on the Emperor's behalf in a see-saw campaign which saw the capital change hands several times. After a peaceful compromise was agreed, Yoshisada was entrusted with two royal princes. At the Siege of Kanegasaki (1337), both princes were killed, along with Yoshisada's son, although Yoshisada was able to escape. He committed seppuku when his horse was killed at the Siege of Kuromaru. Kamakura campaign Long an enemy of Ashikaga Takauji, Nitta Yoshisada is often blamed for the split between the Northern and Southern Courts, as he fought against the Ashikaga and for the emperor, Emperor Go-Daigo. This rivalry came largely from the fact that the Ashikaga were ranked above the Nitta, despite their being descended from a younger ancestor; since the ancestors of the Nitta did not fight alongside their Minamoto cousins in the Genpei War, they were never accorded power or prestige at Kamakura. March on Kamakura In 1331, after being ordered by the bakufu (shogunate) to join an army at the Chihaya fortress, Nitta was ordered by Prince Morinaga and Emperor Go-Daigo to strike at the H≈çj≈ç, so he left his post. Returning to his home province of Kozuke, Yoshisada rallied the aid of other descendants and vassals, including his brother Yoshisuke of the Minamoto clan, and began to march toward Kamakura through Musashi. On the approaches to the city, Nitta enjoyed some early victories, routing the H≈çj≈ç defenders and pursuing them towards the city. Nitta Yoshisada offering his sword to Ry≈´jin Except for its coastline, Kamakura is surrounded by steep hills, making an overland attack difficult. Nitta first tried to enter through the Gokurakuji Pass and the Kewaizaka Pass, but strong H≈çj≈ç forces stopped him. Judging it‚Äôs impossible to enter by land, Nitta decided to try by sea, bypassing Inamuragasaki Cape on Sagami Bay, west of Kamakura. Once there, Nitta took advantage of a low tide and moved his men in through the beaches to the south, but according to the Taiheiki, he threw his sword into the surf and prayed to Ry≈´jin, who parted the waters for him. In describing this event, Japanese sources say Nitta Yoshisada prayed to a sea-god or Ry≈´jin; English sources almost always refer to Sun Goddess Amaterasu. The Taiheiki (Á®≤ÊùëÂ¥éÊàêÂπ≤ÊΩü‰∫ã) says:name=\\"Taiheiki\\" He therefore speaks to Ry≈´jin who, he has heard, is a manifestation of Amaterasu.Mutsu (1995:247) The stele at , the tiny bay west of Inamuragaki, says:Original Japanese text available here > 666 years ago on May 21, 1333Old Japanese lunar calendar date.

(Erected in 1917) Fall of Kamakura The city was taken, and the H≈çj≈ç clan's influence destroyed. Following the fall of Kamakura (and of the H≈çj≈ç regency), Yoshisada was appointed governor of Echigo and vice-governor of Harima and K≈çzuke Provinces, as Emperor Go-Daigo redistributed the H≈çj≈ç lands. Marriage Yoshisada courted a daughter of a court noble, K≈çt≈ç-Naishi (ÂåÇÂΩìÂÜÖ‰æç), and married her through the emperor's mediation. Later campaigns During the following few years, Nitta Yoshisada's rivalry with Ashikaga Takauji and his brother Ashikaga Tadayoshi came to a head, with an imperial commission to destroy the two brothers issued in 1335. The two armies fought a number of battles, starting at the Yahagi River on December and ending at Mishima later that month. Yoshisada's forces were eventually defeated and the brothers advanced upon Kyoto. The Ashikagas were able to capture Kyoto for a few days in February 1336, before help arrived for Yoshisada and Kusunoki from Prince Norinaga and Prince Takanaga. In April 1336 Nitta attacked Akamatsu Norimura in Harima Province. He kept up the investment of Akamatsu's strongholds at Shirohata and Mitsuishi until June, when he retreated in the face of advances by Tadayoshi's army. Yoshisada was defeated in the Battle of Minatogawa allowing Takauji to occupy Kyoto once again. Nitta retreated with the emperor to Hieizan. Eventually, on November 13, 1336, the emperor agreed with Takauji's offers to return to Kyoto. Before he did so, he entrusted Nitta with escorting Prince Takanaga and Prince Tsunenaga to Echizen Province. They made it as far as a loyalist stronghold, where they had to endure the Siege of Kanegasaki (1337) Nitta escaped, but his son Nitta Yoshiaki and the princes were eventually killed. Death Nitta's death was as remarkable as his life. While Nitta was fighting in the Siege of Kuromaru against Hosokawa Akiuji, an ally of Takauji, his horse was felled by arrow fire. Nitta, pinned under the dead horse and unable to move, was an easy target for archers. As a final act, Nitta is supposed to have drawn his short sword and cut off his own head. Record has it that a number of his fellow samurai committed junshi seppuku nearby, in a show of allegiance.Turnbull 2003.

Mammals generally do not have an equivalent organ; the bone marrow is often the site of both hematopoiesis and B cell development. The bursa is present in the cloaca of birds and is named after Hieronymus Fabricius, who described it in 1621. Description The bursa is an epithelial and lymphoid organ that is found only in birds. The bursa develops as a dorsal diverticulum of the proctadael region of the cloaca. The luminal (interior) surface of the bursa is plicated with as many as 15 primary and 7 secondary plicae or folds. These plicae have hundreds of bursal follicles containing follicle-associated epithelial cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells. Lymphoid stem cells migrate from the fetal liver to the bursa during ontogeny. In the bursa, these stem cells acquire the characteristics of mature, immunocompetent B cells The bursa is active in young birds. It atrophies after about six months.https://www.nlm.nih.gov/cgi/mesh/2009/MB_cgi?mode=&term;=Bursa+of+Fabricius Research history In 1956, Bruce Glick showed that removal of the bursa in newly hatched chicks severely impaired the ability of the adult birds to produce antibodies.Glick, B. (1983). The bursa of Fabricius. In \\"Avian Biology\\" Vol. 7 (D.S. Farner, J.R. King, and K.C.Parkes, Eds.). New York: Academic Press. In contrast, removal of the bursa in adult chickens has little effect on the immune system. This was a serendipitous discovery that came about when a fellow graduate, Timothy S. Chang, who was teaching a course on antibody production obtained chickens from Glick that had been bursectomised (removal of the bursa). When these chickens failed to produce antibody in response to an immunization with Staphylococcus bacteria, the two students realized that the bursa is necessary for antibody production. Their initial attempts to publish their findings were thwarted by an editor who commented that \\"further elucidation of the mechanism ... should be attempted before publication.‚Äù The role of the thymus in the immune response was also identified shortly after the discovery of bursa's role in antibody responses. In thymectomized animals, the ability to reject allografts, and to mount delayed hypersensitivity responses, was drastically reduced. By the mid-1960s, immunologists were convinced that there were indeed two separate arms of the immune system: one dealing exclusively with the production of circulating antibodies (humoral immunity), and another that is involved in the delayed hypersensitivity-type reactions and graft rejections (cell-mediated immunity). Diseases Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) is a viral disease in poultry. Typically, the virus attacks the bursa of young birds, preventing development of the immune system.

Coverage area for the Press-Telegram includes Long Beach, Lakewood, Signal Hill, Artesia, Bellflower, Cerritos, Compton, Downey, Hawaiian Gardens, Lynwood, Norwalk and Paramount. The Press-Telegram's precursor, the Press, was first published in 1897. The Press was purchased in the early 20th century by Charles H. Prisk and William F. Prisk, Charles being the owner and William the editor and publisher. Sometime after 1918 The operative reference is the photograph of a still-extant Daily Telegram announcing 1918 Armistice the Press was merged with another paper, the Daily Telegram; the combined paper was first published under the name Daily Press then, from 1924, the Press-Telegram. On September 30, 1933, the Press-Telegram published what David Dayen called \\"One of the more influential letters to the editor in American history\\": Francis Townsend's letter outlining the Townsend Plan, a proposal that sparked a national campaign which influenced the establishment of the Roosevelt administration's Social Security system. In 1952, the Independent (founded in 1938) was merged into the Press-Telegram, creating the Independent-Press-Telegram with the Independent being the paper's morning edition and the Press-Telegram the evening edition. The Independent was discontinued in 1981, leaving only the Press-Telegram (now published in the morning) as the paper's only edition. The paper was owned by Ridder Publications and its successor Knight Ridder from 1952 to 1997, when it was acquired by its current owner, the Los Angeles Newspaper Group (then a division of newspaper conglomerate MediaNews Group). In 2013, MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media merged into Digital First Media.MediaNews Group and 21st Century Media Transaction Has Been Finalized An online version of the paper began web publication in 1995. In 2011, the paper eliminated its sports, photography, and features departments. Some of the eliminated positions were picked up by the Torrance Daily Breeze, another Los Angeles Newspaper Group paper. The paper's longtime home, the Press-Telegram building at 6th Street and Pine Avenue, was sold late 2006 to real estate developers intending to convert the property into condominiums. The paper's operations were moved to the Arco Center in Downtown Long Beach. The building at 6th Street and Pine Avenue in Downtown Long Beach occupied nearly the entire block, and at one time encompassed the entire production of the paper, including the presses, which were formerly visible behind glass windows at street level. The old building on Pine Avenue was eventually acquired and redeveloped by Molina Healthcare. The paper is currently located at 5225 E. Second St., Suite 400 Long Beach, CA 90803. For the 2016 presidential election, the paper chose to endorse no candidate.

Nash is best known as the alleged mastermind of the Wonderland Murders. Early life Nash was born Adel Gharib Nasrallah in British Palestine. His family were Orthodox Christian Palestinians from the city of Ramallah, just outside Jerusalem. Before the creation of Israel in 1948, Nash's family owned 48 hotels. He later told a friend he spent time in a refugee camp and fled the country after Israel Defense Forces soldiers gunned down his brother-in-law. In the early 1950s, Nash emigrated to the United States with only $7. He briefly found work as an actor and stuntman, and was an expert horseman. In 1952, he appeared in a small role as a character named \\"Nash\\" in an episode of the Western series The Cisco Kid. In the 1960s, Nash opened a hot dog stand called Beef's Chuck on Hollywood Boulevard. By the 1970s, Nash owned several nightclubs and restaurants in Los Angeles, such as the P.J.'s club (shortly afterward renamed Starwood) in West Hollywood, the Soul'd Out club in Hollywood, the Odyssey disco, the Paradise Ballroom, the Seven Seas, Ali Baba's, and The Kit Kat strip club. Nash's clubs attracted diverse groups, as he operated clubs marketed towards gays, straights, teenagers, African Americans, and other target audiences. Wonderland murders Nash was most notorious for his alleged involvement in the quadruple Wonderland Murders in 1981, the possible retaliation for a robbery of Nash's home perpetrated two days earlier by three to five men. A key player in the incident, adult film performer John C. Holmes, was later acquitted of the murders. Nash and Holmes were well acquainted with each other; Nash enjoyed introducing his countless houseguests to Holmes, who was infamous for playing the X-rated movie character \\"Johnny Wadd.\\" However, by 1981, Holmes had become desperately addicted to freebasing cocaine, and as a result, his career had declined due to chronic impotence. In order to settle a substantial debt to drug kingpin Ron Launius, leader of the widely feared Wonderland Gang which dominated the Los Angeles cocaine trade, Holmes helped the group plan the invasion. Holmes went to Nash's home on the morning of the attack to leave a sliding door unlocked so the Gang could enter the home. On June 29, 1981, the Wonderland Gang entered into Nash's home via the unlocked sliding door, held Nash and his bodyguard at gunpoint, and stole Nash's drugs, jewelry and money. At one point, one of the Wonderland Gang's member's guns went off, grazing Nash's bodyguard's face. Nash was then made to beg for life on his knees, an act that he found humiliating. Nash quickly suspected John Holmes was involved in the robbery as he had been at Nash's home the morning of the robbery. The following day, a friend of Nash's confirmed his suspicions after telling him he had seen Holmes wearing some of his stolen jewelry. On July 1, two days after Nash was robbed, Ron Launius, Billy Deverell, Joy Audrey Gold Miller, and Barbara Richardson were found bludgeoned to death at their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Susan Launius, Ron's wife, was critically injured but survived. Officials from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) remarked that the Wonderland Murders were particularly brutal, noting that the crime scene was bloodier than the Tate-LaBianca murders. Nash was believed to have planned the murders that were committed by three of his henchman. Nash planned to kill John Holmes but later decided to spare Holmes' life and use the Wonderland murders to \\"teach Holmes a lesson\\". Holmes later told his first wife, Sharon, he was forced to accompany three gunmen to the Wonderland Avenue home. He claimed he was then held at gunpoint and forced to watch the quadruple murders. While police believe Holmes likely took part in the murders, Holmes would maintain that he never killed anyone. A police search of Nash's home days after the murders revealed a large amount of cocaine. Nash was sentenced to eight years in prison, but a judge released him after just two, purportedly due to Nash's poor health. An associate of Nash later admitted that they had bribed the judge with about $100,000.(Goldsmith 2001). In 1990, Nash was tried in state court for having planned the murders; the trial resulted in an 11-1 hung jury. Nash would later admit that he had bribed the lone holdout, a young woman, with $50,000. The retrial ended in an acquittal. According to John Holmes' second wife Laurie (known as Misty Dawn), in a Playboy magazine interview, \\"He [Eddie Nash] was an awful man... John told me he used to leave the bathrooms without toilet paper, then offer the young women cocaine if they'd lick his ass clean.\\"\\"Bigger Than A Payphone, Smaller Than A Cadillac: The Life, Death and Dick of John C. Holmes\\" Throughout the 1990s, law enforcement figures continued to hound Nash, who had been referred to in various print media as \\"the one who got away\\". In 1995, in a broad series of raids targeting alleged organized crime figures, federal agents armed with search warrants raided Nash's house and confiscated what was thought to be a cache of methamphetamine. To the chagrin of law enforcement, the \\"meth\\" turned out to be a cache of mothballs, and no charges were filed against Nash. In 2000, after a four-year joint investigation involving local and federal authorities, Nash was arrested and indicted on federal charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) for running a drug trafficking and money laundering operation, conspiring to carry out the Wonderland Murders, and bribing one of the jurors of his first trial. Nash, by this point in his seventies, and suffering from emphysema and several other ailments, agreed to a plea bargain agreement in September 2001, pleading guilty to RICO charges and to money laundering. He also admitted to jury tampering (for which the statute of limitations had run out) and to having ordered his associates to retrieve stolen property from the Wonderland house, which might have resulted in violence including murder, but he denied having planned the murders that occurred. He also agreed to cooperate with law enforcement authorities. In exchange, he received a four-and-a-half year prison sentence (including time already served) and a $250,000 fine. Bautista murders On September 6 or 7, 1984, Nash's former lover Maureen Bautista and her son Telesforo were stabbed to death by Hells Angels biker Robert Frederick Garceau. Garceau was turned in to the police after he murdered Greg Rambo, who had helped him dispose of the Bautistas' bodies. Rambo's wife, Susan, knew of the Bautista murders and talked to the police under an agreement of immunity. During the trial, Susan Rambo testified that Harlyn Codd had told her Nash was Telesforo's father, and that Nash once had paid Garceau to fulfill a contract but that Garceau had failed to perform and, as a result, Nash was \\"looking for\\" Garceau. At trial, evidence was presented that Garceau murdered Bautista because she threatened to expose Garceau's drug operations to Nash, and Garceau killed her son because Telesforo had witnessed Bautista's murder. Garceau was convicted of all three murders and sentenced to death. A lengthy court appeal of Garceau's death sentence was begun, but in 1993 the California Supreme Court upheld the legality of what became known as \\"The Nash testimony.\\" Garceau died from cancer on San Quentin's death row on December 29, 2004. Death On August 9, 2014, Nash died at the age of 85. He is interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City in Culver City. In popular culture=Films *In the movie Boogie Nights (1997), Alfred Molina plays a character named Rahad Jackson, whose bodyguard, home, and living situation are heavily influenced by Nash's. *In the movie Wonderland (2003), Nash is portrayed by actor Eric Bogosian.

HOGG & JOHN S. WEEKS, KRAUSE PUBLICATIONS, 2000, PAGE 267, ) or FA was a select-fire, crew-served automatic rifle and also world's first operational automatic rifle, designed by Vladimir Grigoryevich Fyodorov in 1915 and produced in the Russian Empire and later in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. A total of 3,200 Fedorov rifles were manufactured between 1915 and 1924 in the city of Kovrov; the vast majority of them were made after 1920. The weapon saw limited combat in World War I, but was used more substantially in the Russian Civil War and in the Winter War. Some consider it to be an \\"early predecessor\\" or \\"ancestor\\" to the modern assault rifle. Design and development Stamp featuring the Fedorov Avtomat The Fedorov Avtomat is a short-recoil operated, locked-breech weapon which fires from a closed bolt. The bolt locking is achieved by a pair of symmetrical plates mounted to either side of the breech and held in place by a sheet metal cover, each with two lugs, one square and one round, mounted at either side of the breech, latching barrel and bolt together through recesses on the bolt. Those plates are allowed to tilt slightly down after about 10 mm of free recoil, unlocking the bolt. A bolt hold-open device is fitted and the firing mechanism is of hammer type. Captain V. Fedorov began a prototype of a semi-automatic rifle in 1906, working with future small arms designer Vasily Degtyaryov as his assistant. A model was submitted to the Rifle Commission of the Russian army in 1911, which eventually ordered 150 more rifles for testing. In 1913, Fedorov submitted a prototype automatic rifle with a stripper clip-fed fixed magazine, chambered for his own experimental rimless 6.5 mm cartridge, called the 6.5mm Fedorov. This new rimless ammunition was more compact than the rimmed Russian 7.62√ó54mmR, better suited for automatic weapons and produced less recoil, however, the round was prone to occasional jamming. When fired from an 800 mm barrel, this experimental cartridge propelled a pointed jacketed bullet weighing 8.5 grams at an initial velocity of 860 m/s with a muzzle energy of 3,140 J as opposed to the 3,550 J muzzle energy of 7.62√ó54mmR ammunition from a barrel of the same length.–ú–∏—Ö–∞–∏–ª –î—Ä–∞–≥—É–Ω–æ–≤, \\"30 –ª–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–Ω–µ–º –∫—Ä–∞–µ\\", –û—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ 1999/4, p. 24 6.5 mm Fedorov rifles were tested late in 1913 with somewhat favorable results. In the autumn of 1915, Fedorov was posted as a military observer to France, in the Mont- Saint-√âloi sector. Here he was impressed by the ubiquity of the French Chauchat and by the firepower it brought, but less so about its mobility. According to Fedorov's memoirs, it is here he came up with the idea of introducing into Russian service a weapon with firepower intermediate between the rifle and the light machine gun, but with mobility comparable to a rifle. His decision to adapt his semi-automatic rifle design for this purpose was one of wartime expediency. Fedorov set to the task upon his return to Russia in January 1916. He retained the mechanism of his semi-automatic rifle, with the major addition of a selective fire switch. The fixed magazine was replaced by a curved 25-round detachable box magazine. Due to limited trial nature of its production, most of its parts were custom fitted and not interchangeable, including the magazine. Therefore, in practice, the Fedorov was issued to the troops with only one magazine, which would be reloaded through the breech via standard 5-round Arisaka stripper clips. Production of the new cartridge was out of question so it was decided to convert 6.5 mm Fedorov rifles to use the Japanese 6.5√ó50mmSR Arisaka ammunition which was in abundance, having been purchased from Japan and Great Britain along with Arisaka rifles. (About 763,000 Arisaka-type rifles were imported to Russia,John Sheehan, \\"Arming Ivan Part II: the bear begs, borrows and buys guns to stay in the fight\\", Guns, Apr 1, 2005–†—É—Å–ª–∞–Ω –ß—É–º–∞–∫. \\"–ù–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–ª–æ–º–µ: –í—ã–±–æ—Ä –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑—Ü–∞ –≤–∏–Ω—Ç–æ–≤–æ—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–æ–Ω–∞ –¥–ª—è —Å—Ç—Ä–µ–ª–∫–æ–≤–æ–≥–æ –æ—Ä—É–∂–∏—è –†–ö–ö–ê\\", –ö–∞–ª–∞—à–Ω–∏–∫–æ–≤. –û—Ä—É–∂–∏–µ, –±–æ–µ–ø—Ä–∏–ø–∞—Å—ã, —Å–Ω–∞—Ä—è–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ (Kalashnikov magazine) 2007/8, pp. 37‚Äì39 along with approximately 400 million cartridges for them; domestic production of the Arisaka cartridge remained insignificant though.) The change of ammunition involved only minimal changes to the rifle, including a chamber insert and a new range scale for the rear sights. The somewhat less powerful Japanese cartridge meant that the muzzle velocity was only about 654‚Äì660 m/s because of constrained barrel length. A US Army analysis from the early 1950s considered that the Fedorov Avtomat was unreasonably complex to manufacture and that it suffered from rapid overheating of the barrel on automatic fire. Russian tests indicated that the gun could fire about 300 rounds continuously before heat buildup rendered it inoperable. This was still an improvement compared to the Mosin‚ÄìNagant M1891 rifles, which would begin to smolder after 100 rounds. The main factor in the increased heat dissipation was the metal shroud over the barrel at the end of the forearm, which acted as a radiator. In terms of accuracy, Russian data indicates that when fired in short bursts the Fedorov Avtomat could reliably hit targets having a profile of 0.6√ó0.5 m at a distance of 200 m. At 400 m the dispersion increased to 1.1√ó0.9 m and at 800 m it was 2.1√ó1.85 m. Consequently, burst fire was only considered effective up to about 500 m. Production and service In 1916, the Weapons Committee of the Russian Army decided to order no less than 25,000 Fedorov automatic rifles. In the summer of 1916, a company from the 189th Izmail Regiment was equipped with eight Fedorov Avtomats. Trained in tactics with the new weapon, they concluded that the Fedorov worked best as a crew-served weapon: the gunner armed with the Fedorov, and an ammo bearer armed with an Arisaka rifle. As both weapons used the same ammo and same 5-round stripper clips, this allowed for the greatest flexibility. It also allowed for the ammo bearer to fire defensively, while the gunner reloaded. It was also recommended that the primary mode of fire be in semi-automatic, as the Fedorov would rapidly overheat in full-auto. After completing their training, the company was deployed to the Romanian front in early 1917. It was supposed to report back valuable combat experience with the new weapon, but this did not happen because the company disintegrated during the Kerensky Offensive. About 10 other Avtomats were given to the Russian naval aviation; Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia telegraphed back that his pilots found it more suitable than the Chauchat in light aircraft.–§–µ–¥–æ—Å–µ–µ–≤, p. 304 In early 1917, the order for Fedorov rifles was limited to 5,000 weapons. However, only about 100 Fedorov Avtomats had been produced before the collapse of the Russian Empire in 1917, when production was halted. The gun's cost estimated in 1918 was 1,090 rubles; in comparison the cost of a Madsen light machine gun was around 1,730 rubles at that time. A Fedorov Avtomat captured during the Winter War with an army handbook on traversing Finnish territory. In 1920, Lev Kamenev found the Fedorov Avtomat to be a promising design and authorized a limited production run. The Avtomat was used to equip Red Army units in the Karelian sector during the Karelian Uprising, particularly the ski battalion of Toivo Antikainen. Reports from combat experiences with the gun during 1921‚Äì1922 were very positive as long as spare parts were available.–ë–æ–ª–æ—Ç–∏–Ω, p. 159 In 1923, 10,000 copies of a 46-page manual for the gun were printed.–ò.–°–≤–µ—Ä—á–∫–æ–≤, –ê–≤—Ç–æ–º–∞—Ç –§–µ–¥–æ—Ä–æ–≤–∞, –í—ã—Å—à–∏–π –í–æ–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –†–µ–¥–∞–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –°–æ–≤–µ—Ç, 1923; number of copies is given on p. 2 Despite some noted reliability issues and performance issues, the Fedorov Avtomat was deemed acceptable for Red Army use in a 1924 review. However, due to supply problems, Soviet leaders decided to abandon all weapons using foreign ammunition.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxHJbEmvCPI As a consequence, production of the Fedorov Avtomat was halted in October 1925. Only 3,200 Fedorovs were manufactured between 1915 and 1925. At the time of its use, the Fedorov Avtomat was one of only three practical fully automatic rifles in service, the other two being the American Browning Automatic Rifle and the French CSRG M1915. Although these alternative rifles were initially intended for mobile assault fire, both models became more or less exclusively used as stationary light machine guns due to their higher weight and caliber. However, the lighter, lower recoil Fedorov Avtomat, which was less than half the weight of the BAR and CSRG, retained a unique niche role as a mobile assault rifle.Avtomat Fedorova Modern Firearms Despite this pioneering status, the Fedorov Avtomat was not without its flaws, and was notoriously difficult to clean, maintain, and repair. After 1925, the rifle was withdrawn from service and put in storage; the last unit to give it up was the Moscow Proletariat Red Banner Rifle Division in 1928. During the 1939‚Äì1940 Soviet‚ÄìFinnish war, an acute lack of individual automatic weapons led to the reintroduction of the stockpiled Fedorovs into service. They were sent to the Karelian front, mostly to military intelligence units. It is presumed that most of the Fedorov Avtomats were expended or destroyed during that war. Terminology Fedorov mechanism schematic Initially Fedorov wanted to call the class of weapons to which his new gun belonged —Ä—É—á–Ω–æ–µ —Ä—É–∂—å—ë-–ø—É–ª–µ–º–µ—Ç (lit. \\"handheld light-machine- gun\\", i.e. a lighter class than —Ä—É–∂—å—ë-–ø—É–ª–µ–º–µ—Ç which denoted light machine guns like the Madsen), which reflected his tactical thinking behind the development of the weapon. This designation appeared in a September 1916 article in the journal of the Artillery Commission. Fedorov's superior, General N.M. Filatov, is credited for introducing the much shorter term \\"avtomat\\" for the gun‚Äîa neologism derived from the Greek word 'automaton' and synonymous with the English word \\"automatic\\", this is the one that stuck. Written records of this new term being applied to the gun date to 1919.–§–µ–¥–æ—Å–µ–µ–≤, p. 309 In contemporary Russian terminology, the word \\"avtomat\\" denotes assault rifle, although historically the term has had a broader meaning. Contemporary Western writers have struggled to classify the Fedorov Avtomat. Some consider it to be an \\"early predecessor\\" or \\"ancestor\\" to the modern assault rifle, while others believe that the Fedorov Avtomat was the world's first assault rifle. The dispute centers on whether the cartridge, which was \\"one of the least powerful rifle-caliber cartridges then in use\\", counts as a full-power or intermediate- power cartridge. Still other writers argue that the Cei-Rigotti (which predates the Fedorov by 20 years) was the world's first assault rifle because it was also select-fire and chambered for an intermediate-power cartridge; however, its 25-round magazine was fed by stripper clips rather than being detachable,http://www.ausairpower.net/SP/DT-MS-AR-1007.pdf Mile Stones, Origins of the assault rifle, Dr Carlo KoppEncyclopedia of United States National Security, by Richard J.

The adaptation follows the original radio series in 1978 and 1980, the first novel and double LP, in 1979, and the stage shows, in 1979 and 1980, making it the fifth iteration of the guide. The series stars Simon Jones as Arthur Dent, David Dixon as Ford Prefect, Mark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox, Sandra Dickinson as Trillian and Stephen Moore as the voice of Marvin. The voice of the guide is by Peter Jones. Simon Jones, Peter Jones, Stephen Moore and Mark Wing-Davey had already provided the voices for their characters in the original radio series in 1978/80. In addition, the series features a number of notable cameo roles, including Adams himself on several occasions. Although initially thought by BBC executives to be unfilmable, the series was successfully produced and directed by Alan J. W. Bell and went on to win a Royal Television Society Award as Most Original Programme of 1981, as well as several British Academy Television Awards for its graphics and editing.  Development and production  After the success of the first seven episodes of the radio series, all broadcast in 1978, and while the second radio series was being recorded, Douglas Adams was commissioned to deliver a pilot script for a television adaptation on 29 May 1979, to be delivered by 1 August. A fully animated version was briefly discussed in the autumn of 1978, but it was eventually decided to make most of the series feature \\"live action\\" and only animate The Guide's entries. John Lloyd, who had worked with Adams on the first radio series, is credited with starting the process of adapting the series for television, after the receipt of the pilot script, with a memo to the head of light entertainment (John Howard Davies) in September 1979. Adams was still working on scripts for the second radio series of Hitchhiker's and working as script editor for Doctor Who, and thus the BBC extended the deadline for the pilot script of the television adaptation to the end of November.Pixley, \\"One Step Beyond.\\" Page 31. The script for the pilot was delivered in December 1979, and terms for the five remaining scripts were agreed upon in January 1980. While there was some resistance to a project considered \\"unfilmable,\\" Alan J. W. Bell was given the duties to produce and direct the TV adaptation. John Lloyd was signed as associate producer. Simon Jones as Arthur Dent, watching his home being demolished in the first television episode. In early 1980, production on the pilot episode began on several fronts. Rod Lord of Pearce Animation Studios directed a 50-second pilot, hand-animated, giving a 'computer graphic' feel to the Babel Fish speech of the first episode. Douglas Adams and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the go-ahead to do all of the animation for episode one, and subsequently the complete TV series.Simpson, Hitchhiker. Page 157. Narration for the first episode was recorded by Peter Jones in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters was done on 8 May 1980. Further filming of crowd reactions to the Vogons, location filming of Arthur's house and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and 16 May 1980. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on 7 June 1980, in the BBC's TC1 studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on 2 July 1980, and it was premiered for a test audience three days later (5 July 1980). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast was reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the autumn, with filming and recording occurring out of order. Recording and production of the final episode continued into January 1981. The gap in production made for some continuity problems between the pilot episode and the remainder. Notably, Simon Jones's hair was cut short for another role and he wears a noticeable hairpiece in later episodes. Conversely, David Dixon's hair appears longer. One major change first appeared in the stage show and LP adaptations, and made its way into the novels and TV adaptation. Nearly all of the sequences from episodes five and six in the first radio series that were originally co-written with John Lloyd were completely cut. Thus the Hotblack Desiato character and Disaster Area make appearances in TV episode five, and Ford, Arthur, Zaphod and Trillian are all randomly teleported off of Disaster Area's stunt ship in TV episode six. Lloyd does receive a co-writer's credit on episode five, for the material on the statistics about the universe. The complexities of adapting the material for television meant that some episodes became as long as 35 minutes; as a result, material that had appeared in the radio series (e.g.: the seance involving Zaphod's ancestors) had to be cut. The programme is particularly notable for its mock computer animation sequences, actually produced on film using traditional cel animation techniques. There have been several different edits of the series: Some, but not all, American PBS stations recut the series into seven 30-minute episodes when they began transmitting the episodes nearly two years later, in December 1982. Other PBS stations re-edited the programme into TV movies, broadcasting more than one episode at a time without interruption. The UK videotape release was on two cassettes, each consisting of three episodes edited to run together and also adding some previously unseen material. The soundtrack was remixed into stereo. The North American VHS tape released by CBS/Fox Video included this material on a single video cassette. The DVD edition claims to be the final and definitive version of the six TV episodes. Mark Wing-Davey as Zaphod Beeblebrox with animatronic second head and third arm. Another production problem was that, being a visual adaptation, a solution had to be found to display Zaphod's three arms and two heads, a joke originally written for radio. In a previous stage adaptation, a version of a pantomime horse was used, where two actors filled one costume, providing three arms and two heads between them. For this TV series, a radio-controlled animatronic head was designed and built, incorporating twelve servo motors and two receivers. However, the head was notoriously unreliable and in many scenes merely sits there, inanimate. For the third arm, most of the time it was seen tucked into Zaphod's jacket. But when called for, Mike Kelt, who had designed the extra head (with Joan Stribling; BBC Make-up, Hair, Prosthetics Designer) would hide behind Mark Wing-Davey and slip his arm into the appropriate sleeve. Other elements to the production were done by a variety of BBC designers. The Heart of Gold and B Ark models were built by Perry Brahan. The small, furry creature from Alpha Centauri in episode three was a puppet designed and controlled by Jim Francis, who also built the Magrathean bubble car (also seen in episode three), and was the stunt double for Richard Vernon in the scene in which the bubble car was seen to fly. Matte paintings throughout the series were created by Jean Peyre. Music and sound effects were by Paddy Kingsland, with the exception of the theme music; the familiar Journey of the Sorcerer theme by Bernie Leadon was used again, in the arrangement by Tim Souster that had previously been used for the Hitchhiker's LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by Dave Jervis. Other puppets, including insects seen in episode five, were designed by Susan Moore. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by Stuart Murdoch, including operating parts of the Dish of the Day animal. Two important cast changes were made for the TV version. David Dixon replaced Geoffrey McGivern as Ford, and Sandra Dickinson replaced Susan Sheridan as Trillian. The changes were made because McGivern did not suit the role visually, and Sheridan was unavailable at the time. Another new cast member was Michael Cule, who appears as the Vogon Guard in episode two. Cule had first appeared in one of the Hitchhiker's stage adaptations, performing no fewer than twelve roles. He reprised the Vogon Guard part in the 1992 Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy TV documentary, voiced the Babel fish, appeared in the 1994 photo illustrated edition of the book (as Prosser), and returned a third time as a Vogon Guard for the BBC Radio 4 Quandary Phase. Because of the sheer number of models used in episodes two to six, a single day of filming just the model sequences was set aside at the BBC Television Centre on 28 October 1980. This has been described as \\"a luxury few other shows could afford.\\" To provide proper timing of spoken lines on-set, Douglas Adams himself spoke the lines of Eddie the Computer and Deep Thought, until they were redubbed by David Tate and Valentine Dyall respectively. Douglas Adams has several cameo appearances in the TV series: *Episode 1: One of the drinkers in the background of the pub. *Episode 2: The man who walks naked into the ocean, similar to Reginald Perrin. The original actor for the part called in sick. *Episode 2: The Guide entry on \\"The Worst Poetry\\" also used Adams's likeness as the basis for the illustration of Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings. *Episode 2: In the future Encyclopedia Galactica, Douglas makes a cameo appearance as one of the Sirius Cybernetic Marketing Division members. *Episode 3: An image in a guide entry on \\"an important and popular fact\\", along with animator Rod Lord, who provided a self-portrait. The hand-animated \\"computer graphics\\" of The Hitchhiker's Guide itself won a BAFTA, a Design and Art Direction Silver award, and a London Film Fest award. The spaceman, suspended from a wire, in the opening title sequence was Alan Harris. Locations for filming included a clay pit and the former Par‚ÄîFowey railway tunnel in Cornwall, the Edmonds Farm and Red Lion pub in Haywards Heath, Sussex, the Budgemoor Golf & Country Club near Henley- on-Thames, and at Dovestones in the Peak District National Park. Episode three was originally scripted to have a \\"pre-credits sequence\\" where Trillian announces their arrival at \\"the most improbable planet that ever existed\\", Magrathea, to Zaphod. This was never filmed. The arrangement of Journey of the Sorcerer by Tim Souster, used in the titles, was released as a single in the UK in January 1981. The B-side featured Douglas Adams playing rhythm guitar. Many of the costumes seen in episodes one to four can be seen again during sequences at Milliway's in episode five. In episode five the writing at the start showing 42 crossed out several times also includes the number 101010 which is the 42nd number in the binary number base.  Episode guide = Episode 1 (Fit the First) First broadcast: 5 January 1981 Synopsis: Episode one begins with a pre-credits sequence, the only one of the TV episodes to have one. A countdown to the end of the world is displayed through animation, and the narrator begins telling the story of the Guide and Arthur Dent's connection to it as the sun rises over the English countryside for the final time. Arthur wakes, discovers the threat to his house from a yellow bulldozer by looking out the window, and the camera pulls back to the titles. This episode closely follows the plot and dialogue of the first episode of the radio series, cutting the speech by Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton. It ends at a slightly earlier point than the radio episode, after Ford's line \\"he might want to read us some of his poetry first\\", and on a cliffhanger that Arthur and Ford are about to be discovered in a Vogon storeroom, but before the Vogon poetry is actually read.

After being read Vogon poetry, they are thrown out of an airlock and improbably rescued by the starship Heart of Gold, which has been stolen by Ford's semi-cousin Zaphod Beeblebrox, accompanied by Trillian, a young woman who Arthur once met at a party. Ford and Arthur are escorted to the bridge by Marvin the Paranoid Android and meet Zaphod and Trillian. The episode ends after they are introduced, with no cliffhanger.

Zaphod has been explaining to Ford that he has found the legendary planet of Magrathea, whilst Trillian tends to a pair of white mice. Zaphod orders the computer to land on the planet surface. Before long, they receive a transmission from the commercial council of Magrathea, informing them that the planet is closed for business and asking them to leave. They ignore this and later receive another message, noting that nuclear missiles have been sent at the ship. Attempts to evade the missiles fail, and Arthur uses the ship's infinite improbability drive, which ends up turning the missiles into a very surprised looking whale and a bowl of petunias. Trillian discovers that during the chaos, her mice escaped. The five characters go onto the surface, where they find it desolate. Zaphod suggests that the Magratheans lived beneath the surface of the planet. They split into two groups ‚Äì Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, while Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface. Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's thread ends on a cliffhanger, with them seeing something alarming at the end of the corridor. Meanwhile, Arthur and Marvin watch the sunset. Eventually, Slartibartfast arrives, and asks Arthur to come with him. He explains that the Magratheans were in hibernation for the last five million years. They get into his air-car, and descend deep into a tunnel. A guide narrative intervenes, explaining that while humanity had always assumed that it was the most intelligent species on Earth, in fact the dolphins were more intelligent, and had left the planet some time before. However, both the dolphins and humans were less intelligent than the mice. Meanwhile, Slartibartfast shows Arthur the vast tract of hyperspace that acts as the Magrathean's factory floor, and that they have been brought out of hibernation for a special commission ‚Äî \\"the Earth Mk II, we're making a copy from our original blueprints\\". The Earth was originally made by Magrathea for mice; and it was destroyed five minutes too early. The episode ends here.

After learning that the Earth was set up to search for the Ultimate Question, Slartibartfast and Arthur join Ford, Trillian, Zaphod, and Trillian's mice, who had guided them to Magrathea. The mice dismiss Slartibartfast, then express their desire to determine the Ultimate Question by first extracting Arthur's brain. While the mice attempt to strike a deal, the galactic police arrive, and Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Zaphod flee the dining hall, only to be cornered by the police in a large bay. After a misunderstanding, the police open fire on a computer behind which the four are hiding, causing it to explode and ending the episode on a cliffhanger.

However, the idea of the role was for that character to have been descended from the earlier programmer, Lunkwill, played by Antony Carrick.  Episode 5 (Fit the Fifth) First broadcast: 2 February 1981 Synopsis: After an initial period of confusion, the four travellers find they have been transported forward in time to just before the end of the universe. They are in \\"Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe\\", which was built on the ruins of Magrathea. So, as Arthur says, they have travelled through time but not through space. Waiting for them is Marvin the depressed robot, whom they left on Magrathea 40 million years ago. He's now an attendant at the car park, and still depressed. Just before the universe ends, Zaphod and Ford get Marvin to help them steal a supercool all-black spaceship, which turns out to be the property of a very loud rock band called \\"Disaster Area\\". The episode ends on the cliffhanger as the black ship is about to start a dive into the sun of Kakrafoon. Cast (in order of appearance): * The Book: Peter Jones * Arthur Dent: Simon Jones * Ford Prefect: David Dixon * Trillian: Sandra Dickinson * Zaphod Beeblebrox: Mark Wing-Davey * Garkbit (Head Waiter): Jack May * Girl on stairs (uncredited): Mary Eveleigh * Hotblack Desiato: Barry Frank Warren * Bodyguard: Dave Prowse * Max Quordlepleen: Colin Jeavons * Dish of the Day: Peter Davison * Marvin (costume): David Learner * Marvin (voice): Stephen Moore * The Great Prophet Zarquon: Colin Bennett  Episode 6 (Fit the Sixth) First broadcast: 9 February 1981 Synopsis: Just before the supercool all-black ship crashes into a sun, Zaphod, Trillian, Ford, and Arthur escape in a teleport module that they convince Marvin to stay behind and operate. He is still on the ship when it heads into the sun. Ford and Arthur arrive - without Zaphod and Trillian - on a spaceship carrying millions of people in cryogenic pods. The ship's inhabitants are from Golgafrincham; they are unskilled workers in apparently pointless jobs, the people that the clever Golgafrinchams, the thinkers and the doers, back home wanted to get rid of. The ship lands on pre-historic Earth. Ford realises that the Golgafrinchams, not the primitive cave dwellers already on the planet, are the ones that will evolve into the human race. The episode ends with the two friends lamenting the eventual destruction of the Earth. The regular theme music follows the song What a Wonderful World by Louis Armstrong.

However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell and/or Geoffrey Perkins involved were all offered as causes), and the second series was never made.Simpson, The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide. Page 96 The elements of the Doctor Who and the Krikketmen project instead became the third novel, Life, the Universe and Everything.  Documentary  100px In 1992, Kevin Davies wrote and directed a documentary entitled The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Davies had previously worked on the stage show at the Rainbow Theatre, and, while working for Pierce Animation Studios in 1980, had introduced Alan Bell to Rod Lord, leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of Simon Jones, David Dixon and Michael Cule, in character, were shot at the farm in Sussex used as Arthur Dent's house, and incorporated into the documentary with some references to So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, such as Arthur finding his home intact, and placing his (animated) Babel fish into a goldfish bowl. BBC video released the sixty-minute documentary on VHS in 1993. Footage not included in the original documentary was included in the 2002 DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has not (as of 2005) been transmitted on TV.  Availability  Front cover of the first part of the UK VHS release of the series. Neil Gaiman reveals in the first edition of his biography of Douglas Adams, Don't Panic, that the BBC was preparing a Laserdisc release of the Hitchhiker's TV series in the mid-1980s, but had to cancel the project due to a legal tangle with the movie rights, although master tapes for the Laserdiscs were prepared. The sound was specially remixed in stereo and Elektra/Asylum records agreed to license the original Eagles theme music. BBC Video eventually was able to do an initial VHS release in 1992. This was a dual cassette edition, with additional material which had originally been cut from the episodes. CBS/Fox Video made the six episodes available on a single tape in North America starting in 1993. They were joined by The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, also on VHS, that same year, as well as a Laserdisc release. The complete series on one tape and the Making of on the second tape could also be purchased in a box set edition. Restoration of the six episodes and the Making of documentary were begun in 2001, with a Region 2+4 DVD release in the United Kingdom by BBC Video (Catalogue Number BBCDVD 1092) in January 2002. A Region 1 edition, released by Warner Home Video, followed in April 2002. Both DVD editions are two-disc sets, with the six episodes on disc 1, and bonus materials on disc 2. The North American DVD edition also has a copy of the Omnibus tribute to Douglas Adams from BBC Two that aired on 4 August 2001, which the UK DVD edition does not. A special edition box set of the series was released on Blu-ray and DVD on 1 October 2018. The set featured upscaled HD versions of the original episodes alongside optional stereo or 5.1 surround sound mixes remastered by Mark Ayres, formerly of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. In North America, the complete series is viewable on Hulu and Amazon Prime. In the UK, the complete series is viewable on BritBox. Reception On Rotten Tomatoes, the show has a 67% approval rating based on 6 reviews.

Wynn was nicknamed \\"The Toy Cannon\\" because his bat had a lot of \\"pop\\" for his small size (, ).  Professional career = Minor leagues  Wynn's career started in 1962 when the Cincinnati Reds signed him as an amateur free agent after he attended Taft High School. He played that season with the Tampa Tarpons in the Florida State League. He played mostly at third base, batting .290 with 14 home runs. After the season, he was drafted by the then Houston Colt .45s in the 1962 first-year player draft.  Houston Astros (1963‚Äì1973)  Wynn began the 1963 season with the Double-A San Antonio Bullets in the Texas League, and while there split his time between shortstop and third base while batting .288 with 16 home runs in 78 games. He was promoted to the major leagues in July, and made his major league debut on July 10. Starting at shortstop, he went 1-for-4 with a stolen base. He split his time during the rest of that initial season between shortstop and the outfield, most often playing left field. He finished the season having played in 70 games, having 61 hits, four home runs, 27 runs batted in, four stolen bases and a .244 batting average. Having struggled defensively at shortstop, Wynn was converted to a full-time outfielder in 1964. He opened the season as the Colt .45s starting center fielder, but was sent back to the minor leagues in June, with Mike White taking over. He was called up in September, and finished the season starting in center field. He ended the season having played 67 games, with 49 hits, five home runs, 18 runs batted in, five stolen bases, and a .224 batting average. He played his first full season the following year, playing in 157 games; accordingly, he had 155 hits, 22 home runs, 73 runs batted in, 43 stolen bases and a .275 batting average and a .371 on-base percentage. His 1966 season ended abruptly after 105 games after breaking his left arm crashing into the outfield wall at Connie Mack Stadium chasing down a Dick Allen fly ball resulting in a game-winning, inside-the- park home run for Allen and the Philadelphia Phillies in the bottom of the 10th inning on August 1, 1966. He had 107 hits, 18 home runs, 62 runs batted in, 13 stolen bases, a .256 batting average and .321 on-base percentage. His 1967 season was a return to form, as he played in 158 games, having 148 hits, 37 home runs (a career high), 107 runs batted in, 16 stolen bases, a .249 batting average and a .331 on-base percentage, was named to his first ever All-Star Game and finished 11th in the MVP voting, being edged out by Hank Aaron (and his 39 home runs) in the home run chase for the season in the final days of the season; it has been speculated Wynn may have lost a substantial number of home runs to the lengthy fences in the Astrodome, while Aaron played in the more homer-friendly Atlanta‚ÄìFulton County Stadium. Aaron himself commented he considered Wynn the season's home run champion. Perhaps Wynn's most famous home run came on June 10 of the 1967 season at Crosley Field. The shot, which came in the eighth inning of the Astros' 8‚Äì3 loss to the Cincinnati Reds, cleared the 58-foot scoreboard in left-center field and landed on Interstate 75 outside the stadium. Five days later, Wynn became the first Houston batter to hit three home runs in one game as his Astros defeated the San Francisco Giants 6‚Äì2 at the Astrodome. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates one month later, on July 23, Wynn hit another tape measure home run, the ball clearing Forbes Field's center- field wall from home plate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4Cn6qusV3c The following season, he played in 156 games while having 146 hits, 85 runs, 26 home runs, 67 runs batted in, 11 stolen bases with a .269 batting average and a .376 on-base percentage, although he walked 90 times and struck out 131 times. His 1969 season had its highs and lows, as he played in 149 games while having 133 hits, 113 runs, 33 home runs, 87 runs batted in, 23 stolen bases, 148 walks (a career high) for a .269 batting average and a .436 on-base percentage (a career high), although he struck out 142 times (also a career high). He finished 15th in the MVP balloting. The following year, he played in 157 games while having 156 hits, 82 runs, 27 home runs, 88 runs batted in, 24 stolen bases, 106 walks, 96 strike outs, and a .282 batting average with a .394 on-base percentage. In the 1971 season, he played in 123 games (his least since 1966), having 82 hits, 38 runs, seven home runs, 45 runs batted in, 10 stolen bases, 56 walks, 63 strike outs, with a .203 batting average and .302 on-base percentage. He returned to form the following season, playing in 145 games while having 148 hits, 117 runs, 24 home runs, 90 runs batted in, 17 stolen bases, 103 walks, 99 strikeouts, and a .273 batting average and a .389 on-base percentage. The 1973 season was his final one with the Astros. He played in 139 games, having 106 hits, 90 runs, 20 home runs, 55 runs batted in, 14 stolen bases, 91 walks, 102 strikeouts with a .220 batting average and a .347 on-base percentage. On December 6, 1973, he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers for David Culpepper and Claude Osteen.  Los Angeles Dodgers (1974‚Äì1975)  Wynn at Minute Maid Park, 2010 In his first season with the Dodgers, he played in 150 games, having 145 hits, 104 runs, 32 home runs, 108 runs batted in, 18 stolen bases, 108 walks, 104 strikeouts, with a .271 batting average and a .387 on-base percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game that season, while finishing 5th in the MVP balloting and being awarded by The Sporting News with the Comeback Player of the Year Award in helping the Dodgers win the National League pennant. In the 1974 NLCS, he had just two hits in 10 at-bats, although he walked nine times and had 2 runs batted in and scored four runs while they beat the Pittsburgh Pirates in four games. In the 1974 World Series, he went 3-for-16 while having 2 runs batted in and his only postseason home run was off Rollie Fingers in the 9th inning of Game 1 in a losing cause. Wynn started 1975 well, although a bad shoulder injury limited his effectiveness at the plate and making throws from center field, thus he was moved to left field. In his second (and last season) with the Dodgers, he played in 130 games, having 102 hits, 80 runs, 18 home runs, 58 runs batted in, seven stolen bases, 110 walks, 77 strikeouts with a .248 batting average and .403 on-base percentage. He was named to the All-Star Game, his third and final selection. On November 17, 1975, he (along with Lee Lacy, Tom Paciorek and Jerry Royster) were traded to the Atlanta Braves for Dusty Baker and Ed Goodson.  Atlanta Braves (1976)  In his only season with the Braves, Wynn played in 148 games, having 93 hits, 75 runs, 17 home runs, 66 runs batted in, 16 stolen bases, 127 walks, 111 strikeouts, with a .207 batting average and a .377 on-base percentage. On November 30, he was purchased by the New York Yankees.  New York Yankees / Milwaukee Brewers (1977)  Wynn spent the final year of his playing career mainly as a designated hitter for the New York Yankees and Milwaukee Brewers, having been released by the Yankees on July 14, then was signed as a free agent by the Brewers 12 days later. He played in 30 games for the Yankees and 36 for the Brewers, for a total of 66 games, garnering 34 total hits, one home run, 13 runs batted in, four stolen bases, 32 walks, 47 strikeouts, with a .175 batting average and a .289 on-base percentage. On October 28, he was released by the Brewers. Career statistics In 1920 games over 15 seasons, Wynn had 8011 plate appearances and compiled a .250 batting average (1665-for-6653) with 1105 runs, 285 doubles, 39 triples, 291 home runs, 964 RBI, 225 stolen bases, 1224 base on balls, 1427 strikeouts, .366 on-base percentage and .436 slugging percentage. Defensively, he posted a career .980 fielding percentage. Following retirement  Wynn's number 24 was retired by the Astros on June 25, 2005, when the Astros played the Texas Rangers. Jason Lane, who wore Wynn's 24 before the ceremony, changed his number to 16 as a result. Wynn previously served as a post-game analyst on Houston Astros television broadcasts on FSN Houston. He also served as a community outreach executive for the team.  In popular culture  In the 1995 film Apollo 13, television footage of Wynn rounding third base is shown as the Apollo astronauts broadcast what they erroneously think is a live feed to a national audience. Death Wynn died on March 26, 2020, two weeks after turning 78, in Houston, TX; no cause was given. Marie, his wife; Kimberly, his daughter; and James, his son, survive him.

Construction Aerial view of Tele2 Arena and Ericsson Globe, April 2018. The Ericsson Globe is the largest hemispherical building on Earth and took two and a half years to build. Shaped like a large white ball, it has a diameter of and an inner height of . The volume of the building is and it has a seating capacity of 16,000 spectators for shows and concerts, and 13,850 for ice hockey. In the upper area there are 40 VIP boxes and a restaurant. The steel, concrete and glass construction designed by the architects Berg Arkitektkontor AB is supported by a MERO space structure. It represents the Sun in the Sweden Solar System, the world's largest scale model of the Solar System. History Globen was inaugurated on 19 February 1989 after a construction period of less than three years. The first major event was the Melodifestivalen 1989. On 2 February 2009, the naming rights to the Stockholm Globe Arena were officially acquired by Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson, and it became known as the Ericsson Globe. Tenants The Globe is primarily used for ice hockey, and is the former home arena of AIK, Djurg√•rdens IF, and Hammarby IF. It is also used for musical performances as well as other sports than ice hockey, for example futsal (indoor football). The third team to play a home game in their league was Huddinge IK (three home games there, all in 1993), followed by Hammarby IF (20 home games in The Globen to this day) and AC Camelen (one game in 1998, in the sixth level league, with 92 spectators). The first international game played in Globen was between Hammarby IF (Sweden) and Jokerit (Finland) a couple of weeks before the grand opening, although the players were only 12 years old at the time (born 1977) and it was a friendly game. The arena has been the home of the finals of Sveriges Television's yearly music competition Melodifestivalen until 2012. Ericsson Globe has hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 and Eurovision Song Contest 2016. It will host several matches of the 2023 World Men's Handball Championship with Sweden co-hosting alongside Poland.  Artwork  A small cottage bolted to the top of the Globe. A small cottage in aluminum with a base was placed upon the Globe on 26 May 2009. The artist, Mikael Genberg, intended it to illustrate two important symbols for Sweden: the high-technology Globe building and the traditional, simple small countryside cottage in Falu red with house corners painted in white. The house was positioned some distance from the exact top position of the Globe. Genberg also hoped to eventually place a similar cottage on the Moon. The cottage remained on the Globe until October 2009. (The sequence starts automatically within a few seconds.) Skyview Assembly of the 'Skyview' elevator using helicopter 6 November 2009 Skyview is an exterior inclined elevator which transports visitors to the top of the arena for a virtually unobstructed view of Stockholm. It has two spherical gondolas, each able to accommodate up to 16 passengers, which travel along parallel tracks on the exterior of the south side of the globe. Skyview opened in February 2010 and carried 160,000 people during its first year of operation.

Pantocrator or Pantokrator, usually translated as \\"Almighty\\" or \\"all-powerful\\", is derived from one of many names of God in Judaism. The Pantokrator, largely an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic theological conception, is less common under that name in Western (Roman) Catholicism and largely unknown to most Protestants. In the West the equivalent image in art is known as Christ in Majesty, which developed a rather different iconography. Christ Pantocrator has come to suggest Christ as a mild but stern, all-powerful judge of humanity. When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek as the Septuagint, Pantokrator was used both for YHWH Sabaoth \\"Lord of Hosts\\"2 Kings (2 Samuel) 7:8 and Amos 3:13 and for El Shaddai \\"God Almighty\\".Job 5:17, 15:25 and 22:25 In the New Testament, Pantokrator is used once by Paul () and nine times in the Book of Revelation: , , , , , , , , and . The references to God the Father and God the Son in Revelation are at times interchangeable, Pantokrator appears to be reserved for the Father except, perhaps, in 1:8. Meaning Byzantine style from the Cefal√π Cathedral, Sicily The most common translation of Pantocrator is \\"Almighty\\" or \\"All-powerful\\". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek words , ' (GEN '), i.e. \\"all\\" and , , i.e. \\"strength\\", \\"might\\", \\"power\\". This is often understood in terms of potential power; i.e., ability to do anything, omnipotence. Another, more literal translation is \\"Ruler of All\\" or, less literally, \\"Sustainer of the World\\". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for \\"all\\" and the verb meaning \\"To accomplish something\\" or \\"to sustain something\\" (, '). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God can do everything). Iconography The oldest known icon of Christ Pantocrator, encaustic on panel (Saint Catherine's Monastery). The two different facial expressions on either side may emphasize Christ's two natures as fully God and fully human.God's Human Face: The Christ-Icon by Christoph Schoenborn (1994) page 154Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine by John Galey (1986) page 92 Mirror composites of the two sides of the face. The icon of Christ Pantokrator is one of the most common religious images of Orthodox Christianity. Generally speaking, in Medieval eastern roman church art and architecture, an iconic mosaic or fresco of Christ Pantokrator occupies the space in the central dome of the church, in the half-dome of the apse, or on the nave vault. Some scholars (Latourette 1975: 572) consider the Pantocrator a Christian adaptation of images of Zeus, such as the great statue of Zeus enthroned at Olympia. The development of the earliest stages of the icon from Roman Imperial imagery is easier to trace.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 96‚Äì99; Burns & Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78‚Äì80; James Hall, A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art, pp. 91‚Äì97, 1983, John Murray, London, The image of Christ Pantocrator was one of the first images of Christ developed in the Early Christian Church and remains a central icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church. In the half-length image, Christ holds the New Testament in his left hand and makes the gesture of teaching or of blessing with his right. The typical Western Christ in Majesty is a full-length icon. In the early Middle Ages, it usually presented Christ in a mandorla or other geometric frame, surrounded by the Four Evangelists or their symbols. The oldest known surviving example of the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in encaustic on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the Iconoclastic disputes that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in Saint Catherine's Monastery, in the remote desert of the Sinai.Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, \\"An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai\\", The Art Bulletin 49.3 (September 1967) pp. 197‚Äì208. The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed to be a very high-quality icon, probably produced in Constantinople.Galey, John, Forsyth, George, and Weitzmann, Kurt, Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine, p. 92, Doubleday, New York, 1980, The icon, traditionally half-length when in a semi-dome,Otherwise the size of the figure would have to be greatly reduced to avoid the head appearing at the flattening top of the semi-dome. which became adopted for panel icons also, depicts Christ fully frontal with a somewhat melancholy and stern aspect, with the right hand raised in blessing or, in the early encaustic panel at Saint Catherine's Monastery, the conventional rhetorical gesture that represents teaching. The left hand holds a closed book with a richly decorated cover featuring the Cross, representing the Gospels. An icon where Christ has an open book is called \\"Christ the Teacher\\", a variant of the Pantocrator. Christ is bearded, his brown hair centrally parted, and his head is surrounded by a halo. The icon is usually shown against a gold background comparable to the gilded grounds of mosaic depictions of the Christian emperors. Often, the name of Christ is written on each side of the halo, as IC and XC. Christ's fingers are depicted in a pose that represents the letters IC, X and C, thereby making the Christogram ICXC (for \\"Jesus Christ\\"). The IC is composed of the Greek characters iota (Œô) and lunate sigma (C; instead of Œ£, œÇ)‚Äîthe first and last letters of 'Jesus' in Greek (); in XC the letters are chi (Œß) and again the lunate sigma‚Äîthe first and last letters of 'Christ' in Greek (). In many cases, Christ has a cruciform halo inscribed with the letters Œü Œ© Œù, i.e. \\"He Who Is\\". File:Pantocr√†tor de Ta√ºll.jpgPantocr√†tor de Ta√ºll, Sant Climent de Ta√ºll Church, Catalonia.

This act expanded on the Representation of the People Act 1918 which had given some women the vote in Parliamentary elections for the first time after World War I. The 1928 Act widened suffrage by giving women electoral equality with men. It gave the vote to all women over 21 years old, regardless of property ownership. Prior to this act only women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications could vote. Similar provision was made for the Parliament of Northern Ireland by the Representation of the People Act (Northern Ireland) 1928 (18 & 19 Geo V, Ch 24 (NI)).David Jarvis, \\"Mrs Maggs and Betty: The Conservative Appeal to Women Voters in the 1920s.\\" Twentieth Century British History 5.2 (1994): 129-152. This statute is sometimes known informally as the Fifth Reform Act or the Equal Suffrage Act. Passing of the act The act was passed by the Conservative Party without much opposition from other parties. The bill became law on 2 July 1928, having been introduced in March. The leader of the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies who had campaigned for the vote, Millicent Fawcett, was still alive and attended the parliament session to see the vote take place. She wrote in her diary the same night \\"It is almost exactly 61 years ago since I heard John Stuart Mill introduce his suffrage amendment to the Reform Bill on 20 May 1867. So I have had extraordinary good luck in having seen the struggle from the beginning.\\" On 5 August 1928 Millicent Fawcett obtained a letter from the prime minister Stanley Baldwin. He points out that even though there were obstacles in passing the bill, he always believed it would be ratified in \\"the simple and complete form it ultimately assumed\\". Baldwin, Stanley. Letter to Fawcett, Millicent. 5 Aug. 1928. MS He finishes the letter by expressing a hope that equal vote would be beneficial for the country and it would serve for the greater good in England. Results The Act added five million more women to the electoral roll and had the effect of making women a majority, 52.7%, of the electorate in the 1929 general election, which was termed the \\"Flapper Election\\".

The BD-1 was designed in 1960 as a kit-built aircraft intended for home assembly by amateur builders. Design goals included a kit price of $US 2500, including a rebuilt 100 hp (75 kW) engine and a cruise speed of 130 knots (240 km/h). The prototype N624BD first flew in 1962. No kits were sold however, and it was not until Bede had been removed from the company and the design was reworked - including the removal of the folding wing feature - that it entered production as the American Aviation AA-1. Design The BD-1 was a low-wing monoplane of all-metal construction, utilizing aluminium honeycomb construction and a laminar flow wing. The aircraft was predominantly of bonded, rather than riveted, construction. It featured a sliding canopy and two seats. The aircraft was designed to be towed behind a car to allow it to be stored at home in a garage and thus reduce hangarage costs. To facilitate this goal the aircraft had folding wings and a horizontal stabilizer of less than 8 foot (2.4 m) width. It was designed to be fully aerobatic as well and was stressed for 9g (90 m/s¬≤). Many parts of the BD-1 were interchangeable to simplify production. For example, the wings were interchangeable as were the fin and horizontal tail. The ailerons and flaps were interchangeable and the rudder and elevators were also. Many aerodynamic and handling compromises were made to achieve this commonality of parts and trailer-ability. The aircraft was intended to be offered with a variety of new or rebuilt engines. Rebuilt engines were to be available to reduce the purchase price. Design powerplants included the Continental A65-8 of , Continental C90-14F of , Continental O-200A of and a Lycoming O-235C1 of . Development The BD-1 was never developed beyond prototype stage and no kits were produced. The company Bede founded to produce the BD-1 kits, Bede Aviation Corporation, eventually became American Aviation and they pursued FAA certification under FAR 23 for the design so that completed aircraft could be sold. Due to financial problems Bede was forced out of the company and the BD-1 was redesigned. During the redesign process the aircraft was modified so that the wings did not fold, making it easier to achieve certification. Other changes included a longer wing to improve rate of climb, an anti-servo tab on the elevator along with an elevator centering spring system to increase longitudinal stability and stall strips to improve the stall performance. The resulting aircraft entered production in the fall of 1968 as the 1969 model American Aviation AA-1 Yankee Clipper. While the BD-1 never did enter production itself, it has had a lasting impact on light aircraft production and spawned a whole series of offspring designs including the Grumman American AA-1, AA-5, and Gulfstream American GA-7 Cougar. The ultimate derivative design, the Tiger Aircraft AG-5B Tiger, was produced until 2006 by Tiger Aircraft.

It marked Humphrey Bogart's final film role.Erickson, Hal. It received an Oscar nomination for Best Cinematography, Black and White for Burnett Guffey at the 29th Academy Awards. Plot Sportswriter Eddie Willis, broke after the newspaper he works for goes under, is hired as a PR man by boxing promoter Nick Benko. Nick has recruited Toro Moreno, a towering Argentinian. Despite Toro's lack of fighting ability, Nick plans to use his size as a gimmick to draw fans to his fights. Unbeknownst to Toro and his manager, Lu√≠s Agrandi, all of his fights are fixed to make the public believe that he is a talented boxer. Eddie feels misgivings about the scheme, but the lure of a huge payday is enough to make him ignore the venture's dishonesty. He is able to spin Toro as a legitimate up-and-comer even when his first fight goes so disastrously wrong that the boxing commission threatens to open an investigation. As Benko's entourage crosses the country in a bus bedecked with advertising for the fighter, Toro gradually becomes a ranked contender. Throughout the tour, Eddie handles negotiations with other boxing managers to ensure Toro's fights remain fixed. Toro fights Gus Dundee, whose previous fight with champion Buddy Brannen has left him feeling unwell. After the Toro fight, Dundee collapses and dies. Toro is overcome with guilt, thinking he killed Dundee, and wishes to return to Argentina. In a last-ditch attempt to protect the upcoming bout with Brannen, Eddie tells Toro the truth: that Brannen was responsible for Dundee's condition, that Toro is no fighter, and that all his fights have been fixed. During the Brannen fight, Toro sustains a brutal beating. Afterward, Eddie learns that Benko has sold Toro's contract to another manager. While Eddie gets his promised payout of $26,000, Benko has rigged the accounting so Toro earns only $49.07. Ashamed of his part in the farce and not wanting to see Toro exploited any further, Eddie gives Toro the $26,000 and puts him on a plane to Argentina before Benko's men can stop them. Though Benko threatens to harm Eddie, Eddie begins writing an expos√© about the corruption.

Steiger recalled the actor's professionalism during production, even while coping with the disease: > \\"Bogey and I got on very well. Unlike some other stars, when they had > closeups, you might have been relegated to a two-shot, or cut out > altogether. Bogey didn't play those games. He was a professional and had > tremendous authority. He'd come in exactly at 9am and leave at precisely > 6pm. I remember once walking to lunch in between takes and seeing Bogey on > the lot. I shouldn't have because his work was finished for the day. I asked > him why he was still on the lot, and he said, 'They want to shoot some > retakes of my closeups because my eyes are too watery'. A little while > later, after the film, somebody came up to me with word of Bogey's death. > Then it struck me. His eyes were watery because he was in pain with the > cancer. I thought: 'How dumb can you be, Rodney'!\\" The film was released with two different endings: one where Eddie Willis (inspired by sports writer Harold Conrad, according to Conrad) demanded that boxing be banned altogether, and the other where he merely insisted that there be a federal investigation into boxing. The video version contains the \\"harder\\" ending, while most television prints end with the \\"softer\\" message. Occasionally inaudible in a take, some of Bogart's lines as Willis are reported to have been dubbed in post-production by Paul Frees. Reception=Critical response The film premiered at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther liked the film, writing \\"It's a brutal and disagreeable story, probably a little far-fetched, and without Mr. Schulberg's warmest character‚Äîthe wistful widow who bestowed her favors on busted pugs. But with all the arcana of the fight game that Mr. Yordan and Mr. Robson have put into it‚Äîalong with their bruising, brutish fight scenes‚Äîit makes for a lively, stinging film.\\"Crowther, Bosley, The New York Times, film review, May 10, 1956. Accessed: August 9, 2013. Dennis Schwartz wrote \\"The unwell Bogie's last film is not a knockout, but his hard-hitting performance is terrific as a has-been sports journalist out of desperation taking a job as a publicist for a fight fixer in order to get a bank account ... The social conscience film is realistic, but fails to be shocking or for that matter convincing.\\"Schwartz, Dennis, Ozus' World Movie Reviews, film review, December 17, 2004. Accessed: August 9, 2013. Lawsuit Primo Carnera sued Columbia for $1.5 million in damages, alleging that the film was based on him and invaded his privacy. The lawsuit was not successful.

It was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries as a supplement to the earlier Type 61. It was based on the best features of a number of contemporary designs, placing it in the same class as the US M60 or German Leopard 1. Like these designs, it mounts the Royal Ordnance L7 rifled 105 mm gun. The design did not enter widespread use until 1980, by which point other Western forces had introduced more capable designs. It was followed by the heavier Type 90. Both the Type 74 and Type 90 are supplemented and will be eventually replaced by the new-generation Type 10 tank. History STB-2 tank The JGSDF began studies on new tank designs with Mitsubishi in 1962, after the Type 61 had been shown to be outmatched by new Soviet tanks such as the T-62. Features from several designs were incorporated, including the controllable suspension of the US-German MBT-70 project, the hull of the Leopard 1, and a similar 105mm gun. The design included a rotating cupola for the commander, and a new autoloader for the main gun. Prior to the 1965 decision to design an entirely new tank, some technologies which would later be used in the STB-1 (first prototype) were already in development independently in Japan. The design was finalized in 1964 and various test rigs were built between 1964 and 1967. Design=Armament The first vessels had been designed to bear the 90mm M3 cannon, present in the Type 61, and ST-A1, revealing itself underpowered. Later in the development stage engineers opted to license the NATO standard Royal Ordnance L7 105mm cannon. Japan only produced the barrel under license, developing an indigenous mantlet, breech and recoil system. The full length of the cannon was 5,592 mm, for a total weight of 2,800 kg. Initially, the main gun only used APDS (Armour-Piercing Discarding Sabot) and HEP (High Explosive Plastic) as its primary ammunition. Later it was modified to fire APFSDS (Armour-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot) and HEAT-MP (High-Explosive Anti-Tank Multi-Purpose) shells as well. The secondary armament consisted of a 12.7mm anti-aircraft machine gun (with 660 rounds) and a 7.62 co-axial machine gun (4500 rounds). Mobility The Type 74 tank is powered by the Mitsubishi 10ZF Model 21 10-cylinder two-stroke cycle diesel engine providing 750 hp (560 kW). At 19 hp/tonne, its power-to-weight ratio is similar to the French AMX-30. The maximum quoted road speed of the Type 74 is 53 km/h; however, speeds of at least 60 km/h have been achieved. Armor Instead of composite armour (as used on the later Type 90 main battle tank), the Type 74 adopted welded steel plates for hull construction, with sloped armour extensively used to defeat armour-piercing shells and other kinetic energy penetrators. It has frontal hull armor of 80 mm with an effective armor thickness of up to 189 mm for the upper glacis and 139 mm for lower glacis. Side armor is 35 mm, while rear armor is 25 mm thick. The cast steel turret has an estimated 195 mm of armor. When compared to other second-generation MBTs, the Type 74 has more armour than a Leopard 1 (122mm and 140mm), but less than comparable Soviet vehicles such as the T62 (174mm and 204mm).:ja:74ÂºèÊà¶Ëªä Service The first prototype, designated STB-1, was delivered in late 1968 and underwent a number of modifications until 1969. The autoloader proved too complex and expensive, and was removed, as was the remote-controlled anti- aircraft machine gun. The overall design of the turret was also changed, becoming longer. These changes resulted in the STB-3, which was delivered in 1971. The final prototype, designated STB-6, was delivered in 1973. Production finally started as the Type 74 in September 1975, with 225 being delivered by January 1980. Production ended in 1989, with total production running to 893 examples. In service, the tanks were updated with the addition of infra-red imagers rather than image intensifiers for the commander and gunner, and a laser rangefinder in the commander's cupola. The gunner's position included a digital fire control computer, fed range data from the commander's range finder. Rounds for the main gun were upgraded from HEP to APFSDS and HEAT-MP. The Type 74 was considered outdated even before it entered service. The Type 90 was to have replaced it outright, but with the end of the Cold War, these plans were scaled back. In 1993 four Type 74s were improved to the new Type 74 Kai (Êîπ) [Type 74 mod G (GÂûã)] standard, adding a passive infrared camera and side skirts. The upgrade proved to be extremely expensive, and the program was abandoned. Variants Rear view. Front view.

Previous definitions used a 30-minute time limit. The seizures can be of the tonic‚Äìclonic type, with a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs, or of types that do not involve contractions, such as absence seizures or complex partial seizures. Status epilepticus is a life-threatening medical emergency, particularly if treatment is delayed. Status epilepticus may occur in those with a history of epilepsy as well as those with an underlying problem of the brain. These underlying brain problems may include trauma, infections, or strokes among others. Diagnosis often involves checking the blood sugar, imaging of the head, a number of blood tests, and an electroencephalogram. Psychogenic nonepileptic seizures may present similarly. Other conditions that may also appear to be SE include low blood sugar, movement disorders, meningitis, and delirium among others. Benzodiazepines are the preferred initial treatment after which typically phenytoin is given. Possible benzodiazepines include intravenous lorazepam as well as intramuscular injections of midazolam. A number of other medications may be used if these are not effective such as valproic acid, phenobarbital, propofol, or ketamine. Intubation may be required to help maintain the person's airway. Between 10 and 30% of people who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The underlying cause, the person's age, and the length of the seizure are important factors in the outcome. Status epilepticus occurs in up to 40 per 100,000 people per year. It makes up about 1% of people who visit the emergency department. Signs and symptoms Status epilepticus can be divided into two categories: convulsive and nonconvulsive (NCSE). Convulsive Convulsive status epilepticus presents with a regular pattern of contraction and extension of the arms and legs. Epilepsia partialis continua is a variant involving hour-, day-, or even week-long jerking. It is a consequence of vascular disease, tumors, or encephalitis, and is drug-resistant. Generalized myoclonus is commonly seen in comatose people following CPR and is seen by some as an indication of catastrophic damage to the neocortex. Refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues despite treatment with benzodiazepines and one antiepileptic drug. Super-refractory status epilepticus is defined as status epilepticus that continues or recurs 24 hours or more after the onset of anaesthetic therapy, including those cases where status epilepticus recurs on the reduction or withdrawal of anesthesia. Nonconvulsive Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is a relatively long duration change in a person's level of consciousness without large scale bending and extension of the limbs due to seizure activity. It is of two main types with either prolonged complex partial seizures or absence seizures. Up to a quarter of cases of SE are nonconvulsive. In the case of complex partial status epilepticus, the seizure is confined to a small area of the brain, normally the temporal lobe. Absence status epilepticus is marked by a generalized seizure affecting the whole brain. An EEG is needed to differentiate between the two conditions. This results in episodes characterized by a long-lasting stupor, staring, and unresponsiveness. Causes Only 25% of people who experience seizures or status epilepticus have epilepsy. The following is a list of possible causes: *Stroke *Hemorrhage *Intoxicants or adverse reactions to drugs *Insufficient dosage or sudden withdrawal of a medication (especially anticonvulsants) *Consumption of alcoholic beverages while on an anticonvulsant, or alcohol withdrawal *Dieting or fasting while on an anticonvulsant *Starting on a new medication that reduces the effectiveness of the anticonvulsant or changes drug metabolism, decreasing its half-life, leading to decreased blood concentrations *Developing a resistance to an anticonvulsant already being used *Gastroenteritis while on an anticonvulsant, where lower levels of anticonvulsant may exist in the bloodstream due to vomiting of gastric contents or reduced absorption due to mucosal edema *Developing a new, unrelated condition in which seizures are coincidentally also a symptom, but are not controlled by an anticonvulsant already used *Metabolic disturbances‚Äîsuch as affected kidney and liver *Sleep deprivation of more than a short duration is often the cause of a (usually, but not always, temporary) loss of seizure control. Diagnosis Definitions vary, but currently it is defined as one continuous, unremitting seizure lasting longer than five minutes, or recurrent seizures without regaining consciousness between seizures for greater than five minutes. Previous definitions used a 30-minute time limit. Nonconvulsive status epilepticus is believed to be under-diagnosed. Treatments Diazepam that can be inserted rectally is often prescribed to caregivers of people with epilepsy. This enables treatment of multiple seizures prior to being able to seek medical care. Benzodiazepines are the preferred initial treatment after which typically phenytoin or fosphenytoin is given. First aid guidelines for seizures state that, as a rule, an ambulance should be called for seizures lasting longer than five minutes (or sooner if this is the person's first seizure episode and no precipitating factors are known, or if SE happens to a person with epilepsy whose seizures were previously absent or well controlled for a considerable time period). Benzodiazepines When given intravenously, lorazepam appears to be superior to diazepam for stopping seizure activity. Intramuscular midazolam appears to be a reasonable option especially in those who are not in hospital. The benzodiazepine of choice in North America for initial treatment is lorazepam, due to its relatively long duration of action (2‚Äì8 hours) when injected, and rapid onset of action, which is thought to be due to its high affinity for GABA receptors and low lipid solubility, which causes it to remain in the vascular compartment. If lorazepam is not available, or intravenous access is not possible, then diazepam should be given. In several countries outside North America, intravenous clonazepam is regarded as the drug of first choice. For instance, a guideline from the Netherlands recommends clonazepam. Cited advantages of clonazepam include a longer duration of action than diazepam, and a lower propensity for the development of acute tolerance than lorazepam. The use of clonazepam for this indication has not caught on in North America, as it is not available as an intravenous formulation there. Particularly in children, another popular treatment choice is midazolam, given into the side of the mouth or the nose. Sometimes, the failure of lorazepam alone is considered to be enough to classify a case of SE as resistant to treatment. Phenytoin and fosphenytoin Phenytoin was once another first-line therapy, although the prodrug fosphenytoin can be administered three times as fast and with far fewer injection site reactions. If these or any other hydantoin derivatives are used, then cardiac monitoring is necessary if they are administered intravenously. Because the hydantoins take 15‚Äì30 minutes to work, a benzodiazepine or barbiturate is often coadministered. Because of diazepam's short duration of action, they were often administered together anyway. Barbiturates Before the benzodiazepines were invented, there were the barbiturates, which are still used today if benzodiazepines or the hydantoins are not an option. These are used to induce a barbituric coma. The barbiturate most commonly used for this is phenobarbital. Thiopental or pentobarbital may also be used for that purpose if the seizures have to be stopped immediately or if the person has already been compromised by the underlying illness or toxic/metabolic-induced seizures; however, in those situations, thiopental is the agent of choice. Carbamazepine and valproate Valproate is available to be given intravenously, and may be used for status epilepticus. Carbamazepine is not available in an intravenous formulation, and does not play a role in status epilepticus. Others If this proves ineffective or if barbiturates cannot be used for some reason, then a general anesthetic such as propofol (French). may be tried; sometimes it is used second after the failure of lorazepam. This would entail putting the person on artificial ventilation. Propofol has been shown to be effective in suppressing the jerks seen in myoclonus status epilepticus. Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist drug, can be used as a last resort for drug-resistant status epilepticus. Lidocaine has been used in cases that do not improve with other more typical medications. One concern is that seizures often begin again 30 minutes after it is stopped. Additionally, it is not recommended in those with heart or liver problems. Prognosis Between 10 and 30% of people who have status epilepticus die within 30 days. The great majority of these people have an underlying brain condition causing their status seizure such as brain tumor, brain infection, brain trauma, or stroke. However, people with diagnosed epilepsy who have a status seizure also have an increased risk of death if their condition is not stabilized quickly, their medication and sleep regimen adapted and adhered to, and stress and other stimulant (seizure trigger) levels controlled. However, with optimal neurological care, adherence to the medication regimen, and a good prognosis (no other underlying uncontrolled brain or other organic disease), the person‚Äîeven people who have been diagnosed with epilepsy‚Äîin otherwise good health can survive with minimal or no brain damage, and can decrease risk of death and even avoid future seizures. Epidemiology In the United States, about 40 cases of SE occur annually per 100,000 people. This includes about 10‚Äì20% of all first seizures. Research Allopregnanolone is being studied in a clinical trial by the Mayo Clinic to treat super-resistant status epilepticus.

He was born around 1480 into the noble family of Berlichingen in modern-day Baden-W√ºrttemberg. G√∂tz bought Hornberg Castle (Neckarzimmern) in 1517, and lived there until his death in 1562. He was active in numerous military campaigns during a period of 47 years from 1498 to 1544, including the German Peasants' War, besides numerous feuds; in his autobiography he estimates that he fought 15 feuds in his own name, besides many cases where he lent assistance to his friends, including feuds against the cities of Cologne, Ulm, Augsburg and the Swabian League, as well as the bishop of Bamberg. His name became famous as a euphemism for a vulgar expression (Er kann mich am Arsch lecken ‚Äì \\"He can lick my ass\\" though in the play it is written as \\"He can kiss my ass\\") attributed to him by writer and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749‚Äì1832), who wrote a play based on his life. Life The second iron prosthetic hand worn by G√∂tz von Berlichingen. armour worn by G√∂tz von Berlichingen, on exhibit in the Hornberg museum. In 1497, Berlichingen entered the service of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. In 1498, he fought in the armies of Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I, seeing action in Burgundy, Lorraine, and the Brabant, and in the Swabian War the following year. By 1500, Berlichingen had left the service of Frederick of Brandenburg, and formed a company of mercenaries, selling his services to various Dukes, Margraves, and Barons. In 1504, Berlichingen and his mercenary army fought for Albert IV, Duke of Bavaria. During the siege of the city of Landshut, he lost his right arm at the wrist when enemy cannon fire forced his sword against him. He had two mechanical prosthetic iron replacements made. The first iron hand was a more simple device, claimed to have been made by a local blacksmith and a saddle maker. The second, more famous prosthetic hand was capable of holding objects from a shield or reins to a quill. Both are on display today at the Burg Jagsthausen. In spite of this injury, Berlichingen continued his military activities. In the subsequent years he was involved in numerous feuds, both of his own and in support of friends and employers. In 1512, near the town of Forchheim, due to a long running and bitter feud with Nuremberg he raided a group of Nuremberg merchants returning from the great fair at Leipzig. On hearing this, Emperor Maximilian placed Berlichingen under an Imperial ban. He was only released from this in 1514, when he paid the large sum of 14,000 gulden. In 1516, in a feud with the Principality of Mainz and its Prince-Archbishop, Berlichingen and his company mounted a raid into Hesse, capturing Philip IV, Count of Waldeck, in the process. A ransom of 8,400 gulden was paid for the safe return of the count. For this action, he was again placed under an Imperial ban in 1518. In 1519, he signed up in the service of Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, who was at war with the Swabian League. He fought in the defence of M√∂ckm√ºhl, but eventually was forced to surrender the town, owing to a lack of supplies and ammunition. In violation of the terms of surrender, he was held prisoner and handed over to the citizens of Heilbronn, a town he had raided several times. His fellow knights Georg von Frundsberg and Franz von Sickingen successfully argued for his release in 1522, but only after he paid a ransom of 2,000 gulden and swore not to take vengeance on the League. In 1525, with the outbreak of the German Peasants' War, Berlichingen led the rebel army in the district of Odenwald against the Ecclesiastical Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Despite this, he was (according to his own account) not a fervent supporter of their cause. He agreed to lead the rebels partly because he had no other option, and partly in an effort to curb the excesses of the rebellion. Despite his wishes to stop wanton violence, Berlichingen found himself powerless to control the rebels and after a month of nominal leadership he deserted his command and returned to the Burg Jagsthausen to sit out the rest of the rebellion in his castle. After the Imperial victory, he was called before the Diet of Speyer to account for his actions. On 17 October 1526, he was acquitted by the Imperial chamber. Despite this, in November 1528 he was lured to Augsburg by the Swabian League, who were eager to settle old scores. After reaching Augsburg under promise of safe passage, and while preparing to clear himself of the old charges against him made by the league, he was seized and made prisoner until 1530 when he was liberated, but only after repeating his oath of 1522 and agreeing to return to his Burg Hornberg and remain in that area. Berlichingen agreed to this, and remained near the Hornberg until Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, released him from his oath in 1540. He served under Charles in the 1542 campaign against the Ottoman Empire of Suleyman the Magnificent in Hungary, and in 1544 in the Imperial invasion of France under Francis I of France. After the French campaign, Berlichingen returned to the Hornberg and lived out the rest of his life in relative peace. He died on 23 July 1562 in Hornberg Castle at the age of 81 or 82. Berlichingen married twice and left three daughters and seven sons to carry on his family name. Legacy G√∂tz left an autobiography in manuscript form (Rossacher Handschrift). The text was published in 1731 as Lebens-Beschreibung des Herrn G√∂zens von Berlichingen (\\"Biography of Sir G√∂tz von Berlichingen\\"), and republished in 1843 as Ritterliche Thaten G√∂tz von Berlichingen's mit der eisernen Hand (\\"Knightly Deeds of G√∂tz von Berlichingen with the Iron Hand\\") (ed. M. A. Gessert). A scholarly edition of the manuscript text was published in 1981 by Helgard Ulmschneider as Mein Fehd und Handlungen (\\"My Feuds and Actions\\"). Goethe in 1773 published the play G√∂tz von Berlichingen based on the 1731 edition of the autobiography. Jean-Paul Sartre's play Le Diable et le Bon Dieu features G√∂tz as an existentialist character. The Waffen-SS 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division G√∂tz von Berlichingen in World War II was named after him. The and each bore the emblem of a \\"War Glove\\" with the legend \\"G√∂tz von Berlichingen!,\\" while an emblem used by the U-69 pictured signal flags spelling out \\"L.M.A.\\" --an initialism of the famed vulgar quote. From commissioning in June 1958 until decommissioning in June 2006, the 2nd Fast Patrol Boat Squadron (2. Schnellbootgeschwader) of the German Navy used the clenched 'Iron Fist' of G√∂tz von Berlichingen in the center of their squadron crest. During World War II, one of the armed merchant cruisers sent by the Kriegsmarine to Japan was named G√∂tz von Berlichingen by its captain after Kriegsmarine HQ rejected his initial suggestion Michael.

The raw materials are squeezed under high pressure in a single step. When used for the extraction of food oils, typical raw materials are nuts, seeds and algae, which are supplied to the press in a continuous feed. As the raw material is pressed, friction causes it to heat. In the case of harder nuts (which require higher pressures) the material can exceed temperatures of . Overview An expeller press is a screw-type machine that mainly presses oil seeds through a caged barrel-like cavity. Other materials used with an expeller press include (but are not limited to) meat by-products, synthetic rubber and animal feeds. Raw materials enter one side of the press and waste products exit the other side. The machine uses friction and continuous pressure from the screw drive to move and compress the seed material. The oil seeps through small openings that do not allow seed fiber solids to pass. Afterward, the pressed seeds are formed into a hardened cake, which is removed from the machine. Pressure involved in expeller pressing creates heat in the range of . Raw materials are typically heated up to to make the pressing more efficient, otherwise the pressing itself will heat the oil to . Some companies claim that they use a cooling apparatus to reduce this temperature to protect certain properties of the oils being extracted.Spectrum Expeller Pressed vs. Cold Pressed Efficiency Expeller processing cannot remove every last trace of liquid (usually oil) from the raw material. A significant amount remains trapped inside the cake remaining after pressing. In most small-scale rural situations this is of little import, as the remaining cake after oil extraction finds uses in local dishes, in the manufacture of secondary products, or in animal feed. Some raw materials do not release oil by expelling, the most notable being rice bran. To remove oil from commodities that do not respond to expelling or to extract the final traces of oil after expelling, it is necessary to use solvent extraction. Design=Continuous screw The earliest expeller presses utilized a continuous screw design. The compression screws were much like the screws of a screw conveyor‚Äîthat is, the helicoid flighting started at one end and ended at the other. Interrupted screw Valerius Anderson invented the interrupted screw design and patented it in the year 1900.Twin screw press with interrupted flights - US Patent 6550376 Description Anderson observed that in the continuous flighting arrangement of a compression screw, there are tendencies for slippery materials either to co- rotate with the screw or to pass through with minimal dewatering. He wrote that \\"brewers' slops, slaughterhouse refuse\\" and other \\"soft and mushy\\" materials dewater poorly in continuous screw presses. His invention consisted of putting interruptions in the flighting of a compression screw. It was much like having a hanger bearing in a screw conveyor: there is no flighting on the shaft at that point, so material tends to stop moving and pile up. It is only after solids accumulate in the gap that the downstream flighting catches material. When this happens, material is forced along its way. The result is better dewatering and thus a more consistent press cake. Resistor teeth After the 1900 patent, a major improvement was made with the addition of resistor teeth. Fitted into the gaps where there is no flighting, these teeth increase the agitation within the press, further diminishing co-rotation tendencies. Expanded applications As the years passed, applications of the interrupted screw design expanded beyond slippery and slimy materials. This happened because competing continuous screw presses worked best only under conditions of constant feed, at constant consistency. If either the consistency or the flow rate diminished, squeezing would diminish until it was inadequate for proper moisture removal. At the same time, if the consistency increased, the press could jam. To counteract these tendencies it was necessary to build a heavy press, frequently with a costly variable speed drive. In contrast, it was found that the interruptions in the flighting of the Anderson screw would provide cushion within the press. If consistency decreased, compression was still effective. A plug of sufficiently solid material had to build up at each interruption before solids could progress toward the discharge. This self-correcting performance prevents wet material from purging at the cake discharge. It is achieved without varying the speed of the screw. The economic advantages of these characteristics led to interrupted screw presses being used to dewater fibrous materials that are neither slippery nor slimy.

Mooney is a fictional character on the 1960s CBS situation comedy The Lucy Show, portrayed by Gale Gordon. Mooney was the president of the local bank in Lucy Carmichael's (Lucille Ball) hometown of Danfield. As such, he was also the trustee of an apparently sizable trust fund of which the widowed Mrs. Carmichael was the beneficiary, left to her by her late husband. Much of the series' humor in its early episodes was based around Lucy's attempts to get Mooney to allow her to invade the principal of the trust, with Mooney steadfastly resisting Lucy's often harebrained schemes. Gordon joined the show at the beginning of its second season in September 1963, and in a two-part episode that introduced the character, the tone of their frequently antagonistic relationship was immediately set, as Lucy accidentally locked herself and Mooney in the bank vault overnight. Gordon was to have joined the series at its premiere in 1962, but he was still contractually obligated to his role as Mr. Wilson on Dennis the Menace. Consequently, Charles Lane played the similar Mr. Barnsdahl character in The Lucy Show‚Äôs first season. Eventually, Lucy had spent so much of her time and efforts at the bank that it seemed logical to make her a paid bank employee, and she became such, serving as Mooney's secretary. In the series' later years, both Mooney and Lucy moved to California, where Mooney became vice president of a larger bank and Lucy again served as his secretary. The Mooney character's role expanded with the shift in locale to California, as The Lucy Show's other costar, Vivian Vance, left the series at the same time. Mooney became a key figure in nearly every episode from this point on. The Mooney character is best remembered for his ill-temper and shouting outbursts at the incompetent \\"Mrs. Carmichael\\". During their time in Danfield, he also did battle with Lucy's school friend, the Countess Framboise (n√©e Rosie Harrigan, and played by Ann Sothern), who had been widowed herself by her husband, who was badly in debt. Since she was looking for money to pay off his debts, she crossed swords with Mr. Mooney, whom she invariably called \\"Mr. Money\\". When The Lucy Show ended in 1968, Gordon moved to Ball's new show Here's Lucy in the role of Lucy's brother-in- law, Harry Carter, a character similar in temperament and demeanor to Mooney. He remained with the new program until it left the CBS lineup in 1974. He then played the similar character Curtis McGibbon on the short-lived Life with Lucy in 1986. Gordon would reprise the character one last time in the first episode of the 1991 sitcom Hi Honey, I'm Home!

The southern portion of Chicago Midway International Airport is located within this community area.  History  The history of Clearing begins shrouded in mystery. An anomalous subdivision began showing up in maps as early as 1870. Local author and historian Robert Hill calls this the \\"Lost Village\\". This subdivision appears between present day Nashville and Narragansett and between 59th and 63rd streets. Though when names appear, they are different from what they are currently. For example, Narragansett is Major. The area gets its name from the fact that farm goods from the area were \\"cleared\\" (delivered) through the airport and railroad yards. Clearing was first incorporated as a town in 1912, within the Township of Stickney. The Clearing area quickly became a part of Chicago in 1915 because the growing population needed services provided by the city. It is bordered on the west by Harlem Avenue, on the east by railroad tracks just east of Cicero Ave., to the North by 59th street and to the south by 65th street. The southern portion of Midway Airport is in Clearing. The Clearing Industrial District was founded in 1909. Lawler Park (), is located in Clearing.

Rear-Admiral William Branford Shubrick. Harper's New Monthly Magazine, August 1876, Vol. 53, pp. 400‚Äì407. His father served in the Continental Army under Generals Nathanael Greene and Benjamin Lincoln during the American Revolutionary War. Two of his sons joined the army and four sons including William chose naval career. He briefly studied at Harvard College in 1805-1806 before being commissioned a midshipman on June 20, 1806 at the age of sixteen joining his older brother, John Templer Shubrick. Naval career He started his active service on the Mediterranean Squadron in USS Wasp in May 1807. It was aboard this ship where he met his lifelong friend James Fenimore Cooper, who was assigned to the Wasp in November 1809.Phillips, Mary Elizabeth. James Fenimore Cooper, New York: John Lane Company, 1912, p. 216. At the end of 1809, Shubrick transferred to the Atlantic Squadron to Argus and sailed along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Shubrick was promoted to lieutenant on January 5, 1812 on the eve of the War of 1812. After duty in Hornet, he was assigned to Constellation. While that frigate was at Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 June 1813 he led a party of bluejackets in beating off a British attack against Craney Island. He subsequently was awarded the Congressional medal for service in Constitution during her capture of HMS Cyane and Levant. During the subsequent decades before the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, Shubrick commanded, in turn, Lexington and Natchez; directed operation of the West Indies Squadron from 1838 to 1840; and headed the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing from 1845 to 1846. At the outbreak of the war with Mexico, Shubrick requested sea duty and, in Independence, sailed for the California coast to relieve Commodore John D. Sloat in command of American Naval forces there. However, Commodore James Biddle brought his East India Squadron to Monterey, California, on 2 January 1847 only a week after Shubrick's arrival, and assumed command. In April, Shubrick sailed for the coast of Mexico to head the blockade of Guaymas and Mazatl√°n. Early in June, Shubrick was recalled to California where Biddle restored him to overall command on 19 July and sailed for the East Coast. Under Shubrick, the Navy successfully conducted the closing operations of the war on the Pacific coast. Highlights were the capture of Guaymas in October and occupation of Mazatl√°n in November. San Blas fell in January 1848. The following spring, Shubrick headed home and took command of the Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1849. Beginning in 1853, he headed the Bureau of Construction and Repair, and between 1854 and 1858, he chaired the Lighthouse Board. In October 1858, Shubrick sailed in command of the fleet sent to South American waters to support diplomatic efforts to resolve differences with Paraguay resulting from the firing upon USS Water Witch.

In December 1861, a law was passed by Congress according to which all navy officers were to retire after reaching sixty-two years or accumulating forty five years of service; Shubrick was placed on the retired list. He was promoted to rear admiral on the retired list on 16 July 1862 and for ten years served as chairman of the United States Lighthouse Board where he was a member since 1852.William B.

The first of these was formed in 1942, during the North African campaign and surrendered to the Allies at Tunis in 1943. The army was re-formed in France in 1944, fought in Western Europe and surrendered in the Ruhr pocket in 1945. History=Formation in Italy and deployment in North Africa On 17 November 1942, the Stab Nehring staff, assigned to the German general in Rome, was reformed to become the LXXXX Army Corps. This staff was soon repurposed to become the 5th Panzer Army. The 5th Panzer Army was created on 8 December 1942 as a command formation for armoured units forming to defend Tunisia against Allied attacks which threatened, after the success of the Allied Operation Torch landings in Algeria and Morocco. The army fought alongside the Italian First Army as a part of Army Group Afrika. The army capitulated on 13 May 1943, along with its commander Gustav von Vaerst. The army was disbanded on 30 June 1943. Normandy The army was reformed on 24 January 1944 as Panzer Group West, the armoured reserve for OB West. The new army was placed under the command of Leo Geyr von Schweppenburg. The method of employment of Panzer Group West in the event of an allied invasion was the subject of much controversy, with OB West commander Gerd von Rundstedt and Army Group B commander Erwin Rommel favouring different methods. Rundstedt and Geyr von Schweppenburg believed that the panzer group should be held in reserve some distance from the front, to counter-attack Allied penetrations. Rommel was convinced that Allied air power and naval artillery would not allow the Germans the freedom to move large formations and so insisted that the panzers should be deployed much closer to the front line. Adolf Hitler forced an unhappy compromise on the western commanders and refused to allow them to commit the panzer group without his authority. When the Allied Invasion began on 6 June 1944, Panzer Group West remained immobile; by 8 June, Geyr had been able to rush three panzer divisions northward to defend Caen against British and Canadian forces. Geyr planned to launch the divisions in a counter-attack that would drive the British and Canadians back into the sea. On 10 June, Schweppenburg was wounded in an attack on the Panzer Group West headquarters at La Caine. Geyr's tank units managed to limit the British advance for another month but he was relieved of his command on 2 July, after seconding Rundstedt's request that Hitler authorize a strategic withdrawal from Caen. On 2 July he was replaced by Heinrich Eberbach. The panzer group fought against the Allied forces in Normandy, suffering heavy losses and eventually finding many of its divisions trapped in the Falaise Pocket. After the shattered remnants of the panzer group escaped from Falaise, it began a retreat towards the German border. Retreat, Ardennes In August, the remaining elements of Panzer Group West were reorganized as 5th Panzer Army, with a combat formation remaining in action under the title Panzer Group Eberbach. After a brief period under Sepp Dietrich, command of the army passed to Hasso von Manteuffel. The army saw heavy combat on the German border against Allied forces, the panzer divisions suffering heavily from Allied ground attack aircraft. In November the 5th Panzer Army began forming up in the Ardennes, alongside the newly formed 6th SS Panzer Army under Dietrich. Both formations took part in the Battle of the Bulge, the Fifth Panzer Army was set to be the main central force advancing westwards from the pre-existing front lines, suffering heavy losses in battles around Bastogne and in the armour battles around Celles and Dinant, the westernmost points of advance. After the offensive was cancelled, it continued its fighting withdrawal to the German border. In March, it was involved in efforts to eliminate the American bridgehead over the Rhine at the Ludendorff Bridge in Remagen. The 5th Panzer Army was encircled and trapped in the Ruhr Pocket, and surrendered on 17 April 1945.

Most European and Asian bond and futures prices are quoted in decimals so the \\"tick\\" size is 1/100 of 1%.Interest Rate Derivatives: Fixed Income Trading Strategies. Eurex Frankfurt AG. p.7 Stocks and futures Tick size is the smallest increment (tick) by which the price of stocks, futures contracts or other exchange-traded instrument can move. The purpose of having discrete price levels is to balance price priority with time priority. If the tick is too small then too much of a preference is given to price priority meaning that market makers and the general public will have less of an incentive to post their orders well in advance since people can jump ahead of them by increasing their price by a small, virtually inconsequential, fraction. If the tick is too big then the opposite happens and time priority is given far too much of an advantage. The size of a tick is picked to basically balance those two priorities. Tick sizes can be fixed (e.g., USD 0.0001) or vary according to the current price (common in European markets) with larger increments at higher prices. Heavily-traded stocks are given smaller tick sizes. An instrument price is always a rational number and the tick sizes determine the numbers that are permissible for a given instrument and exchange. In Europe, Mifid has resulted in a variety of multilateral trading facilities (MTF) with distinct tick size regimes for the same stocks. These differences mean that order routing systems must be aware of every MTF's tick size regime and adjust outgoing orders accordingly. There is now an industry effort underway to harmonise tick sizes. As of 2019, the article 49 of the new MiFID II directive requires trading venues to adopt minimum tick sizes in relation to equity and certain equity-like instruments. Why are price increments limited to ticks? In theory, the price for a stock could be any fraction of a dollar (or euro, yen, ...). American stocks could be traded on 1/100 of a cent: the usual trade is 100 shares and a penny in the trade price would be 1/100 of a cent when calculated per share. But that's not the case: per share, it is still traded in cents. The reason is that if the difference between two prices was very small, it would be easier to do \\"penny jumping\\", which is a small scale version of front running.

It tells the story of Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell), a writer who moves into a remote mansion and finds herself terrorized by supernatural forces. It was made at the peak of popularity for interactive movie games and features live-action actors and footage, both during cinematic scenes and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. It was noted for its violence and sexual content. Williams had long planned to design a horror game, but she waited eight years for software technology to improve before doing so. More than 200 people were involved in making Phantasmagoria, which was based on Williams' 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. The game was originally budgeted for $800,000, but it ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop and was filmed in a $1.5 million studio that Sierra built specifically for the game. The game was directed by Peter Maris and features a cast of twenty-five actors, all performing in front of a blue screen. Most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, while Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed that it was intended for adult audiences, and the company willingly submitted it to a ratings system and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content. Phantasmagoria was released on seven discs after multiple delays, but it was a financial success, grossing $12 million in its opening weekend and becoming one of the best-selling games of 1995. Sierra strongly promoted the game. It received mixed reviews, earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone while being criticized for its slow pacing and easy puzzles. The game also drew controversy, particularly due to a rape scene. CompUSA and other retailers declined to carry it, religious organizations and politicians condemned it, and it was refused classification altogether in Australia. The sequel Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh was released in 1996, although Williams was not involved. Gameplay Phantasmagoria includes a user interface with a screen that shows gameplay and cinematic scenes, surrounded by a stone border with buttons and inventory slots. The game integrates live-action performers within the three-dimensional rendered environments of the game. Phantasmagoria is a point-and-click adventure game that features live-action actors and cinematic footage, both during scenes between the gameplay and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were at the peak of their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon. In this single-player game, the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who is always on the screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to \\"talk to\\" when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, and walk. The mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier Sierra On-Line games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can click to perform an action.Dembo, p. 64 Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it. The user interface is a screen surrounded by a stone border, with buttons and eight inventory slots along the bottom. Adrienne can only hold eight items at once, and each black slot can contain an image of an item that the user can click on to retrieve or use within the game. In the middle of the inventory slots is a \\"P\\" button that brings up an options screen, allowing the player to save or restore games, change the game screen to full- or half-size, control the volume, or switch between a censored version of the game and uncensored one, with more graphic content. A chapter gauge on this screen conveys how much progress remains in a given chapter. A fast-forward button, located above the options button, allows the user to skip past cinematic scenes. On the left side of the interface is a red skull button, which the user can click to receive hints. On the right side is a red button with a picture of a closed eye, which displays any inventory item that the user drags to the button. The display shows a close-up image that can be turned in multiple directions. Game designer Roberta Williams, co-founder of Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive so it would be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward. Plot Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell) and her photographer husband Don Gordon (David Homb) have just purchased a remote mansion off the coast of a small New England island previously owned by a famous 19th-century magician, Zoltan \\"Carno\\" Carnovasch (Robert Miano), whose five wives all died mysteriously. Adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home, but starts having nightmares immediately upon moving in. She is comforted by the loving and supportive Don. Adrienne explores the estate, making mysterious discoveries like strange music, warnings written on her computer, and ominous messages from a fortune-teller automaton. Unbeknownst to the happy couple, Carno had practiced black magic when he lived in the mansion and had summoned an evil demon that possessed him and caused him to murder his wives. During her exploration of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly toward Adrienne, and rapes her. Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him to stay away from his wife. After Mike leaves the mansion, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death. While the local townspeople believe all Carno's wives died of natural causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in grotesque ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an alcoholic, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is force-fed animal entrails through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a s√©ance for Adrienne, revealing in the form of a green ectoplasm the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again. Adrienne visits the nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (Douglas Seale), who had been Carno's apprentice as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (Jeff Rector), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most dangerous escapology trick, in which Carno donned a burning hood and escaped from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage left Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survived and attacked Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno was killed by Gaston, who then succumbed to his own wounds. Malcolm tells Adrienne about a ritual that can eradicate the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides to leave with Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, which pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne walking out of the mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic. Development= Conception  Phantasmagoria was a radically different game for Williams, who was best known for designing the family-friendly King's Quest fantasy adventure game series.\\"The Ultimate\\", p. 30 Williams said she did not want to get typecast in a particular genre, adding: \\"I felt I had more to offer than fairy stories. I wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions.\\"\\"The Ultimate\\", p. 32 Although Phantasmagoria was her first horror game, Williams had created murder and crime stories in her earlier mystery games, Mystery House and the Laura Bow series. Williams was a fan of the horror genre, although she did not watch many horror films as a child after a traumatic experience watching Horrors of the Black Museum (1959) at age four. She began watching them again as a teen, and particularly enjoyed such films as Halloween (1978),Shannon, p. 8 and movies based on Stephen King novels, like Carrie and The Shining (1980). Williams cited the works of King and Edgar Allan Poe as the inspirations behind Phantasmagoria. Williams had wanted to make a horror game for eight years prior to Phantasmagoria, and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the computer game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player had to be able to empathize with the character to fear for them.Shannon, p. 5 Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.  Writing  Phantasmagoria was the first Sierra On-Line game script to be written like a film screenplay.Shannon, p. 150 During the writing stage, Williams was under pressure to ensure Phantasmagoria was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband Ken Williams, the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company to focus more on lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in Phantasmagoria. Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial, but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don. She felt the rest of the story \\"would make no sense\\" without the scene, but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from the game before production ended. The script numbered roughly 550 pages when completed, about four times the size of an average Hollywood screenplay. It also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes. In preparation for writing it, Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels, as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays.Shannon, p. 9 She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear. She immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading. She also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process. Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games, like the Laura Bow series and some of the King's Quest games. She said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne, although it was not purposeful: \\"I think it just kind of naturally worked out that way.\\" Andy Hoyos, the game's art director and a horror aficionado, participated in brainstorming sessions and discussions with Williams during the writing stage.Shannon, p. 98 He conceived the ideas for most of the death scenes and tried to make each one different and original with what he called \\"fresh approaches to murder\\". Williams wanted to include more scenes with Adrienne and Don as a happy, normal couple, so that Don's transformation to evil would have greater impact. She proved unable to do so while also maintaining the correct pacing for the gameplay. Williams wrote Phantasmagoria with the mass market in mind, targeting casual players as well as die-hard computer game fans. To that end, she wrote the game in short chapters to break it into smaller, easier-to-play sections. Her targeted demographic for the game was ages 16 and older. She chose the title \\"Phantasmagoria\\" after reading the word in a reference book about the history of magic and magicians. The term refers to a 17th-century theatrical horror show in which \\"spirits of the dead\\" were revealed in a darkened theater by the use of a modified magic lantern. Design Andy Hoyos was the art director for Phantasmagoria,Shannon, p. 97 and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy were among the computer artists.Shannon, p. 102 It was the first computer game Prugh worked on.Shannon, p. 104 Mark Hood, a veteran Sierra programmer,Shannon, p. 144 and Mark Seibert served as Phantasmagoria project managers.Shannon, p. 147 Seibert called managing the project \\"much more of a technical and managerial problem-solving job than I ever envisioned\\".Shannon, p. 148 Unlike previous Sierra games, it also involved managing a great deal of outside resources, such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule. The game's three-dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on Silicon Graphics software. In creating the look of the game, Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of Tim Burton, and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting, sets and \\"imaginative edge\\" of Batman (1989). Other influences included the films Alien (1979) and Hellraiser (1987). Phantasmagoria was designed using the 3-D software package Alias.Shannon, p. 103 Hoyos started by designing the rooms,Shannon, p. 105 then created the furniture, and added textures and lighting. Once complete, the computer rendered final images of each room, which became the backgrounds for the game. While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures,Shannon, p. 145 Phantasmagoria had more than 1,000. The game developers realized early during development that the game could not be completed entirely in-house due to the large scope of the project, and required working with Hollywood agencies, actors and special effects houses, among others. This added further complexity to the game's development and design. Gerald B. Wolfe, the game's director of photography, spoke to the artists about how to set up the camera angles during filming to best accommodate the design of the rooms. Mannequins created in the computer substituted as stand-ins for the actors to help Wolfe position the shots. Most of the artists had never created computer-generated backgrounds for video-captured characters, and found it to be a challenging process. Seibert said bridging the gap between Hollywood and the software world was difficult at first, but after about four weeks of shooting, the two sides had \\"come to a common language and had a greater understanding of the process\\". Hoyos said the biggest difficulty in designing the look of the game was creating a definitive scale for the environment, and ensuring the objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism.Shannon, p. 100 Once the filming was completed, more than 20 two-hour Beta SP video tapes of footage had to be edited down to fit the actions of the game.Shannon, p. 146 The programming included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes.Shannon, p. 149 The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs to reduce the number of times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected. Casting Twenty-five professional actors were cast in Phantasmagoria.\\"A First Look\\", p. 26 Roberta Williams watched the audition tapes of all the roles, and was involved with Mark Seibert in picking the actors. The only actor that Siebert chose without Williams' input was Victoria Morsell as the protagonist, Adrienne Delaney. Williams had watched other audition tapes for the part and was not happy with any of the choices. While she was on vacation, Seibert watched Morsell's audition and immediately selected her for the part. Williams was initially concerned that she was not involved in the decision, but later came to agree that Morsell was the correct choice. Morsell mostly had television experience, but had also previously worked in film and theater roles.Shannon, pp. 127‚Äì128 She had to work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, for three months to capture all her character's actions and movements. David Homb portrayed Adrienne's husband, Don Gordon.Shannon, p. 132 Morsell and Homb started dating in real life after filming.Shannon, p. 131 Robert Miano was cast as the villain Zoltan \\"Carno\\" Carnovasch. He had previously appeared in several films by Phantasmagoria director Peter Maris.Shannon, p. 138 The comic relief roles of Harriet and Cyrus were played by V. Joy Lee and Steven W. Bailey, respectively. Lee had mostly done theater work in the Atlanta and Seattle areas, along with appearing in some industrial films and an episode of Northern Exposure.Shannon, p. 139 Bailey had been an actor in Seattle for about three years, doing mostly stage work, as well as some commercials, television episodes, independent films, and industrial films for the United States Navy.Shannon, p. 141 Malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor Douglas Seale. Stella Stevens played the antiques store owner Lou Ann, Geoff Pryser played Bob the realtor, and Carl Neimic played phone technician Mike. Traci Clauson portrayed Marie, Carno's fifth and final wife. Filming Phantasmagoria was Sierra's first game to use live actors integrated with computer-generated backgrounds. About 600 scenes were filmed for the game. The total filming took about four months, 12 hours a day, shooting six days a week. More than 200 people were ultimately involved in the making of the game. A total of $800,000 was originally budgeted for Phantasmagoria, but it ended up costing $4.5 million. The budget issues caused some friction between Roberta and Ken Williams. It was the first game made in a new filming studio built by Sierra in Oakhurst, California, the same location as Sierra's headquarters.Shannon, p. 115 It cost $1.5 million to build and was overseen by studio manager Bill Crow, who said, \\"Phantasmagoria essentially started with the design and creation of the studio\\". Sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage the shooting process, including software to digitize the video into the computer. Some of the software was built as the game was being made and as the need for new tools was being identified.Shannon, p. 116 Sierra wanted the game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a director with experience in the film industry. They hired Peter Maris,Shannon, p. 112 whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies.Shannon, p. 114 Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated a great deal from the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective.\\"The Ultimate\\", p. 34 Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors,Shannon, p. 113 using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting.\\"A First Look\\", p. 27 All filming was done entirely in front of a blue screen, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by Petro Vlahos's UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made Phantasmagoria a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist. Due to the nature of filming for a computer game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before,Shannon, p. 128Shannon, p. 140Shannon, p. 143 and Miano had only done it once.Shannon, p. 135 Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive.Shannon, p. 130 Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with.Williams, p. 14 During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood in such a way that his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.Shannon, p. 133 Morsell found it challenging to film a scene near the end of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.Shannon, p. 118 The chase scene at the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne throughout the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said \\"we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax\\". Several scenes in Phantasmagoria involved animals, including a Doberman Pinscher, two cats, a beagle and several rats.Shannon, p. 123 Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillan and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals.Shannon, p. 122 Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for Phantasmagoria were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether. Despite a storyline running over a course of seven days, Adrienne wears the same wardrobe throughout the entire game: an orange shirt and black pants. Williams said this is because many of Adrienne's actions throughout the game can be repeated by the player over and over, making it difficult to change her wardrobe without it becoming \\"a nightmare of shooting\\". The only solutions she saw were to allow less decision-making by the player, or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes. Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game. An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen. None of the characters wear blue, purple, gray or any shade of green similar to the blue screen for that same reason. Effects In one of several special effects created by The Character Shop, a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head was pulled apart by strings to create the appearance that a demon was ripping the head apart. For Phantasmagoria's special effects, Sierra sought the professional effects house The Character Shop, headed by senior creature maker Rick Lazzarini.Shannon, p. 119 The core special effects team for the game consisted of Lazzarini, Michael Esbin and Bill Zahn.Shannon, p. 121 Lazzarini said making Phantasmagoria was a much faster and more cooperative process than in the film industry. Due to the tight filming schedule, most effects had to be done in one shot with no cuts, so there was less margin for error.Shannon, p. 120 They created the effects for all the death scenes in the game, which included creating assorted body prostheses, burn makeup and what Lazzarini called \\"gallons of fake blood\\", which was made of sugar, water and dye. Adrienne's head is split open by a swinging pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head,Shannon, p. 129 with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached to either side so it could be pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.Shannon, p. 12 One scene involved a burning head, which was created by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax to make it look bumpy. Another special effect involved a spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a s√©ance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring.Shannon, p. 13 It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful,Shannon, p. 14 and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes. Music Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User created the musical score for Phantasmagoria, with Neal Grandstaf providing additional music.Shannon, p. 108 Most of the music is a mixture of real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer.Shannon, p. 110 Themes for the music ranged from rock and roll to opera. The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating stingers as needed.Shannon, p. 109 For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry.Shannon, p. 111 The opening theme of the game features a neo-Gregorian chant, which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the underscore music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a \\"pounce\\" effect, creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of Phantasmagoria, when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings are used in the score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments. Release Phantasmagoria took more than two years to develop. Sierra officials said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: \\"It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do.\\" The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, Phantasmagoria was not among them because it was not ready yet. The date was changed once more to August 3, before it was finally released in stores on August 24, 1995, the same day as the Microsoft's operating system Windows 95 version. Phantasmagoria came out first for Windows 95, Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS, then for Macintosh computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out at the same time as the game. Phantasmagoria was also ported to Sega Saturn and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name Phantasm. In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication Multimedia World, said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with Outpost, for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing Outpost and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an IBM compatible 486‚Äì25, 8 megabytes of RAM, 5 megabytes hard disk space, SVGA (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported Sound Blaster-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95. Phantasmagoria was heavily advertised by Sierra in advance of its release, and the company touted it as its biggest game to date. It was Sierra's first computer game targeted to an adult audience. There was no legislated rating system for computer games in the United States in place, although one was being debated before the U.S. Senate at the time. Sierra was among several major software companies that voluntarily supported the ratings system designed by the Entertainment Software Rating Board, which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases. The game was given an \\"M\\" rating for \\"mature\\" audiences, meaning intended for audiences 17 or older. As a result, it carried a content warning on the box that said \\"contains adult subject matter\\". The game box prominently displayed this rating, as well as a warning on the back panel that the game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children. It also encouraged parents to review the material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors. Phantasmagoria also received mature ratings in Germany and the United Kingdom. The game itself includes a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs during the most violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed it was the first CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: \\"There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line.\\" But Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the censoring option was \\"unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old\\" and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, \\"the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are\\". In October 1997, the first chapter of Phantasmagoria was included in the Roberta Williams Anthology, a limited-edition collection of 15 games created by Williams over 18 years. Phantasmagoria was made available for digital download on the website GOG.com starting in February 2010 for $9.99. Reception=Sales Phantasmagoria quickly became the best-selling game in the United States, and was Sierra's best-selling computer game to date. It grossed $12,000,000 and sold 300,000 units during its first week-end of release, debuting at number four in PC Data's August 1995 list of top-selling computer games for MS-DOS and Windows. It followed MechWarrior 2, Microsoft Flight Simulator and Myst. By September, it had reached number one on the list among computer games and ranked third among all computer software, following Windows 95 and Microsoft Plus! InterAction, a magazine published by Sierra On- Line, wrote that no other Sierra game topped game charts as quickly as Phantasmagoria did.\\"Phantasmagoria: Unprecedented Success\\", p. 25 By the end of December, it remained at number three among overall software, and number one among computer games, and by January it was estimated as many as 500,000 copies had been sold. According to Sierra On-Line, its global sales surpassed 600,000 units by March 1996. Phantasmagoria finished 1995 as the ninth best- selling game of the year according to an analysis by PC Data of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, Phantasmagoria was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind Microsoft Flight Simulator, Myst and Command & Conquer, and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh, and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling computer software programs according to Computer Life magazine. One year after Phantasmagoria was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than one million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone. NPD Techworld, which tracked sales in the United States, reported 301,138 units sold of Phantasmagoria by December 2002. Reviews Phantasmagoria received mixed reviews. Vince Broady, executive editor of Multimedia World, said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as The 7th Guest. Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle declared it the best game of the year, calling it a \\"masterwork\\" and \\"as close as it gets to a film you control\\", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. Entertainment Weekly gave it a B+ and called it \\"one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies\\". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some \\"horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a Freddy Krueger-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed\\". Kim McDaniel of The Salt Lake Tribune called it \\"the most sophisticated computer game to date\\" and \\"a weird, wild, horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart\\". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced players, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual players than difficult games like The 7th Guest. A Billboard magazine review said Phantasmagoria \\"lives up to the advanced billing\\" and \\"aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex\\". USA Today writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and \\"a much-needed change from normal fare\\", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of The Providence Journal said the game was \\"an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer- generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming\\". He also called the gameplay \\"elegant in its simplicity\\". San Francisco Chronicle writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for Next Generation was pleased with the story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced players, since they would be able to finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for those who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, \\"The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach.\\" Steve La Rue of U-T San Diego found the game \\"visually opulent and interesting\\" with \\"dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite gothic novel plot\\", but also said he had to adjust to the \\"gradual, contemplative pace\\". Jack Warner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote: \\"It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going\\", although he said \\"precious little happens\\" in the first few discs. Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo called the storyline of a couple buying a haunted mansion \\"a clich√© so familiar that it needs no explanation\\", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne was too much of an exaggeratedly feminine \\"girlie-type girl\\". Overall, Dembo said the game \\"achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game\\" and was \\"an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry\\". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria \\"appears to deliver on its ambitious promises\\" and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that \\"would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks\\". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was \\"hilariously bad\\" and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with \\"so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before\\". Other reviews were more negative. GameSpot writer Jeff Sengstack said the expensive budget and long production history \\"do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming\\". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered \\"[the game] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame\\". Mike Hall of the Albuquerque Journal compared Phantasmagoria to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like Cleopatra and Waterworld. He said the graphics were beautiful, but the game ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. The Escapist writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were \\"ordinary, pixilated fare\\" was \\"odd and unflattering\\". A one-star review in The Video Games Guide, published in 2013, \\"now seems little more than a flawed, though ambitious, white elephant\\". In a 2014 review, IGN writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that Phantasmagoria wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content for the end of the game. But he said it was ultimately \\"less a bad game than a bad horror film\\" and said the execution, \\"although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices\\". Awards Phantasmagoria earned an Editor's Choice Award from PC Gamer, and a Golden Triad Award from Computer Game Review, whose editors later gave it their 1995 Best FMV of the Year prize. It was nominated for Best Adventure/Role-Playing Software in the annual Excellence in Software Awards competition, known in the game industry as \\"The Codies\\", which are among the most prestigious honors in software development. It was also named Best Adventure Game of the Year by Games Magazine, Game of the Month by Windows Magazine, and was one of three nominees for PC/Computing's Game of the Year. Controversy Before Phantasmagoria was released, CompUSA, the nation's largest discount computer retailer, notified Sierra it would not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: \\"Software comes out all the time. Some we buy, some we don't. This one we chose not to.\\" Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of Jefferies & Co., a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, and that it could in fact help it generate publicity. He added that \\"It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever.\\" Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, \\"When you say you're not going to carry something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about.\\" Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: \\"I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product.\\" Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock Phantasmagoria, but others like Walmart continued to carry it. As well as the graphic gore and violence, the rape scene in Phantasmagoria drew particular attention and objections from the game's critics. One major newspaper claimed Phantasmagoria \\"makes a game of sexual violence\\". Multiple parents' groups, religious organizations, community action committees and special interest groups called for a boycott, and sent letters to the Sierra offices in droves voicing objections to the game. Phantasmagoria was unable to be sold in Australia after being refused classification by Office of Film and Literature Classification (the R 18+ classification was not available for video games at the time). The Roberta Williams Anthology collection was also banned in Australia because it featured a one-chapter preview of the game. The governments of two other countries also banned Phantasmagoria. The game was spotlighted in U.S. Senate hearings debating regulation of content in the computer software industry, and there was talk that it could re-ignite the debate in Congress over whether to impose federally mandated ratings on computer software that stores would be required to enforce. Sierra found that Williams tended to garner extremely favorable press, even as Phantasmagoria got negative press, so the company began having her discuss the game in person. In response to the backlash, Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television, which she said often have more violent content than Phantasmagoria, in part because computer games are often regarded as children's entertainment rather than for adults. Williams said Phantasmagoria was less excessively violent than games like Doom and Mortal Kombat, and that unlike those games, Phantasmagoria is \\"the good guy ... not going around shooting up people\\". Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the company's vice president of sales, both expressed surprise at the reaction to the game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing, box warnings and censoring options. Cloutier said the company was essentially \\"censoring ourselves\\". Steven L. Kent of The Seattle Times said there were more violent games than Phantasmagoria, but that most video game violence appears in computer animations, and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live- action game, which elicits a stronger emotional response. In April 1998, three years after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under criticism for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in Cendant, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the Phantasmagoria and other Sierra games. Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell, Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad, and Lamar Alexander, the former governor of Tennessee, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in West Paducah, Kentucky, and Jonesboro, Arkansas, and the \\"increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down in front of a computer screen\\". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of Phantasmagoria or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: \\"We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that.\\" The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in California, Ohio and Texas. Legacy The commercial success of Phantasmagoria had a positive financial impact on Sierra On-Line. Before its release, the company's stock rose in July 1995, up $3.875 to $30.875, which Vince Turzo of Jeffries & Co attributed in part due to anticipation of Phantasmagoria. Sierra's stock continued to rise after it was released. The company closed on the NASDAQ stock market at $43.25 on September 8, 1995, translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months, which Turzo attributed partially to Phantasmagorias success. For the quarter ending September 30, 1995, Sierra posted a profit of $3.26 million, compared to a loss of $850,000 in 1994. This improvement exceeded expectations in analysts' forecasts, and was thanks largely to Phantasmagoria sales. Williams returned to work on the King's Quest series after Phantasmagoria was completed. Sierra used the same technology and Hollywood techniques from Phantasmagoria to make The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (1995), another interactive movie adventure game. Williams later described Phantasmagoria as the game that best represented her career as a game designer. Due to its development delays, Phantasmagoria was released after other interactive movie games like Wing Commander III and Under a Killing Moon, so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that game subgenre as the other titles. Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said by the time it was finally released, \\"computer games that incorporate video [were] becoming a common sight on the software store racks\\". Sean Clark, a project leader at LucasArts, feared the success of Phantasmagoria would set a bad precedent in that software companies would think they need huge budgets and many discs to have a successful game, rather than focusing on quality. Sequel A Phantasmagoria sequel, Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh (1996), was released by Sierra a year after the original. It was written and designed by Lorelei Shannon, Roberta Williams' design partner on King's Quest VII. Williams was not involved with it, and the game featured a very different tone and completely different characters, with no direct connection to the storyline of the first game.Salter, p. 75 Shannon said the original game was a haunted house story in the style of a \\"late night creature feature\\", while her game has more science-fiction and fantasy horror elements, in the style of the works of Clive Barker and Tanith Lee. Roberta Williams said both she and her husband Ken enjoyed the sequel. A preview for A Puzzle of Flesh was included in the first CD of the original Phantasmagoria game. Ken Williams had wanted Roberta to work on a Phantasmagoria sequel immediately after the success of the first game, but she could not do so due to her obligations to King's Quest VIII. Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because players could sense the absence of Roberta's style. \\"It's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten. Within a few pages, the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed, regardless of the quality of the work.\\" Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after A Puzzle of Flesh because of issues after Sierra was acquired by CUC International in 1996. Distribution was handled by Davidson & Associates, another CUC company, which primarily sold educational software. Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in Phantasmagoria and did not attempt to sell the sequel as aggressively as Sierra would have.Ramsay, p. 203 He also claimed Jan Davidson, the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson, personally did not like the game and \\"wanted it shut down\\". Due to these sales challenges, Williams said \\"there was no reason to make a third Phantasmagoria\\". Roberta Williams said she was asked by Sierra to make a third Phantasmagoria game, and that she said she would consider it, but it was not ultimately made.

He may be known best for his four Star Wars novels, including the novelization of Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith. He has also written several fantasy novels, including Iron Dawn and Jericho Moon. He has written four science-fiction/fantasy hybrid stories featuring a hero named Caine: Heroes Die, Blade of Tyshalle, and Caine Black Knife, with the most recent, Caine's Law, released April 4, 2012. Biography Stover attended Danville High School in Danville, Illinois, and graduated in 1979. He then graduated in 1983 from Drake University, and settled in Chicago for many years, before relocating to St. Petersburg, Florida. He is an avid martial artist and a student of the Degerberg Blend, a Jeet Kune Do concept that mixes approximately twenty-five different fighting arts from around the world. This combat style influences the way Stover writes his fight scenes, for which he has won considerable acclaim. He is also the founder and self-described \\"international grandmaster\\" of a parodic self-defense system he calls Hu√†n Dao (\\"Way of the Hedgehog\\"), which he has described as \\"self-defense for people too lazy to train and too smart to fight.\\" He says the system was inspired by a passage from the ancient Greek soldier-poet Archilochus: \\"The fox is swift and clever and knows many tricks, yet still he is taken by the hounds. The hedgehog is slow and dull, and knows only one trick -- but it is a very good trick.\\" He sometimes refers to Huan Dao as \\"Fatmattjitsu.\\" His non-Star Wars novels have garnered a smaller but loyal audience, primarily for the Acts of Caine cycle. As for future Star Wars novels, Stover has said that he would be interested in writing the final adventure of the heroic trio of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia.

Before U.S. Route 101 was built through the Gaviota Pass, SR 154 was the main throughway to Santa Barbara and the tri city area including use as a stagecoach route in early years. After being replaced by US 101 as the primary route between the Santa Ynez Valley and Santa Barbara, SR 154 now serves as a scenic bypass. Route description California SR 154 marker sign on San Marcos Pass Road in Santa Barbara It is a 2 lane road with some passing lanes, with the highest altitude being 2000 ft. It rivals US 101 for traffic, but it goes through the Los Padres National Forest and the San Marcos Pass. It starts in Los Olivos as a spur from US 101, goes through the town, and then the end of SR 246 at Santa Ynez. It then reaches Lake Cachuma and passes through the Los Padres National Forest, and across the Cold Spring Canyon Arch Bridge, where Cold Spring Tavern is on Stagecoach Road which passes below the bridge. Nearby it crosses Camino Cielo Road to the East and West, then the intersection of Painted Cave Road and Old San Marcos Road before descending to Santa Barbara. It then briefly becomes four lanes and passes an offramp for SR 192 (named Foothill Road to the East and Cathedral Oaks Road to the West of SR 154), before stopping at Calle Real and a Southbound onramp to US 101 and ending at the point where State Street to the East becomes Hollister Avenue to the West. SR 154 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is not part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 154 is eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, and is officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a \\"memorable landscape\\" with no \\"visual intrusions\\", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community.

It is the smallest and most abundant of the Pacific salmon. The scientific species name is based on the Russian common name for this species gorb√∫≈°a (–≥–æ—Ä–±—É—à–∞), which literally means humpie. Appearance In the ocean, pink salmon are bright silver fish. After returning to their spawning streams, their coloring changes to pale grey on the back with yellowish-white belly (although some turn an overall dull green color). As with all salmon, in addition to the dorsal fin, they also have an adipose fin. The fish is characterized by a white mouth with black gums, no teeth on the tongue, large oval-shaped black spots on the back, a v-shaped tail, and an anal fin with 13-17 soft rays. During their spawning migration, males develop a pronounced humped back, hence their nickname \\"humpies\\". Pink salmon average 4.8 pounds (2.2 kg) in weight.Fisheries and Oceans Canada species account Retrieved 2007 October 16 The maximum recorded size was 30 inches (76 cm) and 15 pounds (6.8 kg).Fishbase species account Retrieved 2007 October 16 Reproduction Pink salmon in their native range have a strict two year life cycle, thus odd and even-year populations do not interbreed. In the state of Washington, Pink salmon runs occur on odd years. Adult pink salmon enter spawning streams from the ocean, usually returning to the stream where they originated. Spawning occurs between late June and mid-October, in coastal streams and some longer rivers, and in the intertidal zone or at the mouth of streams if hyporheic freshwater is available. Using her tail, the female digs a trough-shaped nest, called a redd (Scandinavian word for \\"nest\\"), in the gravel of the stream bed, where she deposits her eggs. As she expels the eggs, she is approached by one or more males, which fertilize them as they fall into the redd. Subsequently, the female covers the newly deposited zygotes, again with thrusts of her tail, against the gravel at the top of the redd. The female lays from 1,000 to 2,000 eggs in several clutches within the redd, often fertilized by different males. Females guard their redds until death, which comes within days of spawning. In dense populations, a major source of mortality for embryos is a superposition of redds by later-spawning fish. The eggs hatch from December to February, depending on water temperature, and the juveniles emerge from the gravel during March and April and quickly migrate downstream to estuaries, at about one-quarter gram in weight. The fish achieve sexual maturity in their second year of life. They return to freshwater in the summer or autumn as two-year-old adults. Pink and chum salmon sometimes interbreed in nature to form the hybrid known as the miko salmon; the hybrids are sterile. Distribution and habitat Pink salmon are coldwater fish with a preferred temperature range of 5.6 to 14.6 ¬∞C, an optimal temperature of 10.1 ¬∞C, and an upper incipient lethal temperature of 25.8 ¬∞C. The native range of the species is in the Pacific and Arctic coastal waters and rivers, from the Sacramento River in northern California to the Mackenzie River in Canada; and in the west from the Lena River in Siberia to Korea and Honshu in Japan. In North America pink salmon spawn from the Mackenzie River in the Arctic to as far south as tributaries of Puget Sound, Washington, although they were also reported in the San Lorenzo River near Santa Cruz, California in 1915 and the Sacramento River in northern California in the 1950s. In 2013 a new record for the southernmost extent of spawning pink salmon was published for the Salinas River. In the fall of 2017 a dozen pink salmon were counted in Lagunitas Creek about north of San Francisco, California. Pink salmon were introduced into the Great Lakes of North America, and in Iran. In Europe, pink salmon have been periodically introduced to rivers of the White Sea and Barents Sea basins in Russia since 1956. Stray fish from these rivers have been encountered ascending to rivers also in Norway, Sweden, Ireland, Great Britain and Iceland, and in Norway even self-sustaining populations have been observed.

The industry expanded steadily until 1920. During the 1940s and 1950s, pink salmon populations declined drastically. Fish traps were prohibited in Alaska in 1959. Now, most pink salmon are taken with purse seines, drift nets or gillnets. Populations and harvests increased rapidly after the mid-1970s and have been at record high numbers since the 1980s. More than 20 million harvested pink salmon are produced by fishery-enhancement hatcheries, particularly in the northern Gulf of Alaska.Salmon Enhancement and Hatcheries Retrieved 2007 October 16 Pink salmon are not grown in significant numbers in fish farms. The fish are often canned, smoked or salted. Pink salmon roe is also harvested for caviar, a particularly valuable product in Asia.  References = Citations  Sources   Bonar, S.A., G.B.

Coho salmon are also known as silver salmon or \\"silvers\\". The scientific species name is based on the Russian common name kizhuch (–∫–∏–∂—É—á). Description Coho salmon from Oregon During their ocean phase, coho salmon have silver sides and dark-blue backs. During their spawning phase, their jaws and teeth become hooked. After entering fresh water, they develop bright-red sides, bluish-green heads and backs, dark bellies and dark spots on their backs. Sexually maturing fish develop a light-pink or rose shading along the belly, and the males may show a slight arching of the back. Mature adults have a pronounced red skin color with darker backs and average and , occasionally reaching up to . They also develop a large kype (hooked beak) during spawning.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/static/education/wns/coho_salmon.pdf Mature females may be darker than males, with both showing a pronounced hook on the nose. Reproduction The eggs hatch in the late winter or early spring after six to seven weeks in the redd. Once hatched, they remain mostly immobile in the redd during the alevin life stage, which lasts for 6‚Äì7 weeks. Alevin no longer have the protective egg shell, or chorion, and rely on their yolk sacs for nourishment during growth. The alevin life stage is very sensitive to aquatic and sedimental contaminants. When the yolk sac is completely resorbed, the alevin leaves the redd. Young coho spend one to two years in their freshwater natal streams, often spending the first winter in off-channel sloughs, before transforming to the smolt stage. Smolts are generally and as their parr marks fade and the adult's characteristic silver scales start to dominate. Smolts migrate to the ocean from late March through July. Some fish leave fresh water in the spring, spend summer in brackish estuarine ponds, and then return to fresh water in the fall. Coho salmon live in salt water for one to three years before returning to spawn. Some precocious males, known as \\"jacks\\", return as two-year-old spawners. Spawning males develop kypes, which are strongly hooked snouts and large teeth.

Human uses Freshly caught coho Fisheries The total North Pacific harvest of coho salmon in 2010 exceeded 6.3 million fish, of which 4.5 million were taken in the United States and 1.7 million in Russia. This corresponds to some 21,000 tonnes in all. Annual Statistics 2010: Commercial salmon catch by species and country North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission Statistical Yearbook. Retrieved 2015 March 16. These numbers do not include fish taken in Russian waters by foreign fleet. Coho salmon are the backbone of the Alaskan troll fishery; however, the majority are caught by the net fishery (gillnet and seine). Coho salmon average 3.5% by fish and 5.9% by weight of the annual Alaska salmon harvest.(Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute, 2003, p. 2) The total North Pacific yields of the pink salmon, chum salmon and sockeye salmon are some 10‚Äì20 fold larger by weight. Game fish In North America, coho salmon is a game fish in fresh and salt water from July to December, especially with light fishing tackle. It is one of the most popular sport fish in the Pacific Northwest of the United States and Canada. Its popularity is due in part to the reckless abandon which it frequently displays chasing bait and lure while in salt water, and the large number of coastal streams it ascends during its spawning runs. Its habit of schooling in relatively shallow water, and often near beaches, makes it accessible to anglers on the banks, as well as in boats. Nutritional value Ocean-caught coho is regarded as excellent table fare. It has a moderate to high amount of fat, which is considered to be essential when judging taste. Only spring chinook and sockeye salmon have higher levels of fat in their meat. Due to the lower fat content of coho, when smoking, it is best to use a cold-smoking rather than hot-smoking process. Cultural tradition Historically coho, along with other species, has been a staple in the diet of several indigenous peoples, who would also use it to trade with other tribes farther inland. The coho salmon is also a symbol of several tribes, representing life and sustenance. Ecology In their freshwater stages, coho feed on plankton in the water column, such as Chironomids, and terrestrial insects that fall into the water. Upon entering the marine environment, they switch to a diet of plankton and fish, with fish making up most of their diets after a certain size. Adult coho feed on a vast variety of prey items that depend on the region they reside in during their second year at sea. Spawning habitats are small streams with stable gravel substrates. Salmonid species on the west coast of the United States have experienced dramatic declines in abundance during the past several decades as a result of human-induced and natural factors. Conservation Coho salmon, Tillamook State Forest, Oregon The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has identified seven populations, called Evolutionary Significant Units (ESUs), of coho salmon in Washington, Oregon and California. Four of these ESUs are listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act (ESA). These are the Lower Columbia River (threatened), Oregon Coast (threatened), Southern Oregon and Northern California Coasts (threatened), and Central California Coast (endangered). The long-term trend for the listed populations is still downward, though there was one recent good year with an increasing trend in 2001. The Puget Sound/Strait of Georgia ESU in Washington is an NMFS \\"Species of Concern\\". Species of Concern are those species for which insufficient information prevents resolving the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's concerns regarding status and threats and whether to list the species under the ESA. On May 6, 1997, NMFS, on behalf of the Secretary of Commerce, listed as threatened the Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast coho salmon ESU.62 Fed.Reg. 24588 The coho salmon population in the Southern Oregon/Northern California region has declined from an estimated 150,000‚Äì400,000 naturally spawning fish in the 1940s to fewer than 10,000 naturally producing adults today. These reductions are due to natural and man- made changes, including short-term atmospheric trends (such as El Ni√±o, which causes extremes in annual rainfall on the northern California coast), predation by the California sea lion and Pacific harbor seal, and commercial timber harvesting. More than 680,000 coho salmon returned to Oregon in 2009, double that of 2007. The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife required volunteers to herd fish into hatchery pens. Some creeks were reported to have so many fish, \\"you could literally walk across on the backs of coho,\\" claimed a Portland television station. Lower temperatures in 2008 North Pacific waters brought in fatter plankton, which, along with greater outflows of Columbia River water, fed the resurgent populations. The 2009 run was so large, food banks were able to freeze for later use.

This periodinane has several advantages over chromium- and DMSO-based oxidants that include milder conditions (room temperature, neutral pH), shorter reaction times, higher yields, simplified workups, high chemoselectivity, tolerance of sensitive functional groups, and a long shelf life. However, use on an industrial scale is made difficult by its cost and its potentially explosive nature. It is named after the American chemists Daniel Benjamin Dess and James Cullen Martin who developed the reagent in 1983. It is based on IBX, but due to the acetate groups attached to the central iodine atom, DMP is much more reactive than IBX and is much more soluble in organic solvents. :Reaction scheme Preparation The most friendly synthesis of IBX has been determined to be treating 2-iodobenzoic acid with oxone in water, at elevated temperatures for 3 hours. IBX is then acylated using Ireland and Liu‚Äôs modifications from the original procedure. These modifications allowed for higher yields and a simplified work up procedure. The resulted solids can be obtained via filtration and washing with ether. Ireland and Liu used a catalytic amount of tosylic acid, which allowed the reaction to complete in less than 2 hours (compared to the classic synthesis, utilizing 24 hours) and in yields exceeding 90%. :Preparation of DMP The classic method presented by Boeckman and Mullins involved heating a solution of potassium bromate, sulfuric acid, 2-iodobenzoic acid to afford IBX (1-hydroxy-1,2-benziodoxol-3(1H)-one 1-oxide, 2-iodoxybenzoic acid). IBX was then acylated using acetic acid and acetic anhydride. :Classic production method Oxidation mechanism Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane is mainly used as an oxidant for complex, sensitive and multifunctional alcohols. One of the reasons for its effectiveness is its high selectivity towards complexation of the hydroxyl group, which allows alcohols to rapidly perform ligand exchange; the first step in the oxidation reaction. Proton NMR has indicated that using one equivalent of alcohol forms the intermediate diacetoxyalkoxyperiodinane. The acetate then acts as a base to deprotonate the Œ±-H from the alcohol to afford the carbonyl compound, iodinane, and acetic acid. When a diol or more than one equivalent of alcohol is used, acetoxydialkoxyperiodinane is formed instead. Due to the labile nature of this particular periodinane, oxidation occurs much faster. :Oxidation by Dess-Martin-Periodinan Schreiber and coworkers have shown that water increases the rate of the oxidation reaction. Dess and Martin had originally observed that the oxidation of ethanol was increased when there was an extra equivalent of ethanol. It is believed that the rate of dissociation of the final acetate ligand from the iodine is increased, because of the electron-donating ability of the hydroxyl group (thus weakening the I-OAc bond). :Water addition Chemoselectivity Using the standard Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane conditions, alcohols can be oxidized to aldehydes/ketones without affecting furan rings, sulfides, vinyl ethers, and secondary amides. Allylic alcohols are easily oxidized using DMP, which are typically difficult to convert to their respective carbonyls using the typical oxidants. Myers and coworkers determined that DMP could oxidize N-protected- amino alcohols, without epimerization (unlike most other oxidants, including Swern oxidation). These protected amino alcohols can be very important in the pharmaceutical industry. Benzylic and allylic alcohols react faster than saturated alcohols, while DMP oxidizes aldoximes and ketoximes to their respective aldehydes and ketones, faster than a primary, secondary or benzylic alcohol to its respective carbonyl. In one example of the Dess‚ÄìMartin oxidation, involves transforming a sensitive Œ±-Œ≤-unsaturated alcohol to its corresponding aldehyde. This moiety has been found in several natural products and due to its high functionality, it could be a valuable synthetic building block in organic synthesis. Thongsornkleeb and Danheiser oxidized this sensitive alcohol by employing the Dess Martin Oxidation and altering the work up procedure (diluting with pentanes, washing with poly(4-vinylpyridine) to remove the acetic acid generated during the reaction, filtering and concentrating via distillation. :Application using DMP t-Butyl DMP Difluoro and monofluoro alcohols are more difficult to oxidize. Swern oxidation has been used, but a large excess of the oxidant had to be employed, and in some cases did not give reproducible results. Linderman and Graves found DMP was successful in most cases but could not tolerate the presence of nucleophilic functional groups in the alcohol, as these reacted with DMP by displacing acetate. Using the compound shown below produced the desired carbonyls in high yields as the addition of the tert-butoxy group, due to its steric bulk, minimizes these side reactions. :t-Butyl DMP See also * Alcohol oxidation * Pyridinium chlorochromate * Jones oxidation * Oppenauer oxidation * Pfitzner‚ÄìMoffatt oxidation * Parikh‚ÄìDoering oxidation * Albright- Goldman oxidation * Swern oxidation * Corey‚ÄìKim oxidation * Ley oxidation (TPAP oxidation) * TEMPO oxidation ReferencesExternal links Category:Oxidizing agents Category:Iodates Category:Periodinanes Category:Name reactions Category:Acetates ","title":"Dess‚ÄìMartin periodinane"},{"id":"1880266","text":"Helen Vanderburg (born January 12, 1959) is a former Canadian synchronized swimmer and world champion.

She was previously a Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Early life and career Priscilla Owen was born in Palacios, Texas. Her earliest years were spent on her family's farm in Collegeport. She later grew up and went to school in Waco. She worked part-time during high school and college at her stepfather's insurance company. During summers, she returned to Collegeport, working in rice fields and herding cattle.See . Owen started college at the University of Texas at Austin and later transferred to Baylor University to be near her family in Waco. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree, cum laude, from Baylor. She then went to Baylor Law School, where she became editor of the Baylor Law Review and graduated cum laude in 1977, receiving a Juris Doctor. From among approximately 400 examinees, at age 23, she received the highest score on the December 1977 Texas bar examination. She joined the Andrews & Kurth law firm in Houston, as a litigator, specializing in oil and gas litigation. She made partner at the age of 30. In private practice, Owen handled a broad range of civil matters at the trial and appellate levels. She was admitted to practice before various state and federal trial courts and appellate courts. She is a member of the American Law Institute, the American Judicature Society, the American Bar Association, and a Fellow of the American and Houston Bar Foundations. In 1993, after 17 years at Andrews & Kurth, she was asked to run for the Texas Supreme Court as a Republican. She won with 53 percent of the vote, promising to restore integrity and dignity to a court tainted by scandal. Owen had written articles and lobbied the Texas Legislature to eliminate partisan election of judges, arguing that they hinder the ability of courts to provide impartial justice. When she was up for reelection in 2000, Democrats did not put up an opponent against her, and she was returned to office with 84 percent of the vote, defeating a Libertarian opponent with the help of endorsements from newspapers statewide. Owen served on the board of Texas Hearing and Service Dogs, which rescues dogs from pounds, provides training for them, and then gives the dogs to disabled people who cannot otherwise afford them. In addition, she was a founding member of the St. Barnabas Episcopal Mission in Austin and has taught Sunday school. In the mid-1990s, Congress reduced funding for the Legal Services Corporation. Owen was part of a committee that successfully encouraged the Texas Legislature to enact legislation that has resulted in millions of dollars per year in additional funds for providers of legal services to the poor. Owen served as the Texas Supreme Court's representative on the Court-Annexed Mediation Task Force, working to resolve differences between lawyer and non-lawyer mediators, in order to provide an alternative to expensive courtroom trials. She has been a member of the Gender Bias Reform Implementation Committee and statewide committees regarding legal services to the poor and pro bono legal services. Owen also served on the boards of advisors of the Houston and Austin Chapters of the Federalist Society. Owen was instrumental in organizing a group known as Family Law 2000 that seeks to find ways to educate parents about the effect that divorce can have on their children and to lessen the adversarial nature of legal proceedings when a marriage is dissolved. Fifth Circuit nomination and confirmation President George W. Bush in 2002 Owen was nominated on May 9, 2001, by President George W. Bush to fill a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit created by Judge William Lockhart Garwood, who had taken senior status on January 23, 1997. Senate Democrats immediately decided to block her nomination for two reasons. First, the Democrats were angry that two previous nominees who President Clinton had nominated to Garwood's empty seat, Jorge Rangel and Enrique Moreno, were never given hearings by the United States Senate during Clinton's second term because the Senate at the time controlled by Republicans. Second, they considered her to be too conservative. As a result the Senate Democrats, who controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee during the 107th Congress, did not let Owen's nomination come up for a vote. In 2003, after Republicans had taken the Senate back, Democrats filibustered her. In 2005, after Republicans picked up four more seats in the Senate during the 109th Congress, her nomination was again considered. Owen had considerable judicial experience as a member of the Texas Supreme Court, and had been rated \\"Well-Qualified\\" (highest possible) by the American Bar Association for the Fifth Circuit position.ABA ratings during 109th Congress. According to ABC News reporter Jan Crawford Greenburg, Senate Democrats strategically \\"targeted outspoken conservatives who were potential Supreme Court picks....their successes in filibustering women, Hispanics, and African Americans in 2003 undermined Bush's plans to replace [retiring U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor] with another woman or a minority.\\"Greenburg, Jan Crawford. Supreme Conflict; The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, pages 255 and 314 (2007). Supporters of the Owen nomination asserted that her criticized rulings were often near- unanimous, or simply followed federal precedents. Owen was touted as a judicial conservative who would, in the words of President Bush, \\"interpret the law, not legislate from the bench.\\"Bush, George. Remarks by the President at Bush-Cheney 2004 Reception (2003-07-18). Opponents, however, criticized her for what they claimed were her conservative positions on contentious social and economic issues, and pro-corporate decisions. Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy said President Bush's appointee for Attorney General, Alberto Gonzales, during his service with Owen on the Texas Supreme Court had frequently criticized Owen; Kennedy said Gonzales argued one of Owen's positions taken in dissent would \\"judicially amend\\" a statute for the benefit of manufacturers selling defective products.. On abortion, Owen was criticized by pro-choice groups for her interpretation of Texas's parental-notification law, and for joining a majority decision on overrides only once.. In May 2005, a compromise was arranged by a bipartisan group of moderate senators called the Gang of 14, which allowed for Owen to finally be given a full Senate vote. On May 24, 2005, debate on her nomination was ended by a vote of 81‚Äì18. She was finally confirmed by a vote of 55‚Äì43 on May 25, 2005, and was sworn in on June 6, 2005. Owen was the third judge nominated by Bush to the Fifth Circuit and confirmed by the United States Senate. Possible Supreme Court nomination In 2005, Owen was often cited as a potential Bush Supreme Court nominee to replace retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor. On September 17, 2005, Minority Leader Harry Reid informed Majority Leader Bill Frist that Owen would be filibustered if she were nominated for the Supreme Court, but Frist believed at the time that Owen could still be confirmed in the face of a filibuster.Novak, Robert. Chicago Sun-Times, (2005-09-18) Notable opinions In June 2015, Owen joined Judge Carolyn Dineen King in reversing an unconditional writ of habeas corpus granted to Albert Woodfox, one of the Angola Three inmates at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. The ruling, which held that Judge James Joseph Brady of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana abused his discretion in issuing the writ, kept 69-year-old Woodfox in solitary confinement at the penitentiary until his release on February 19, 2016. In 2010, Owen joined Emilio M. Garza and Edith Brown Clement in affirming the dismissal of the complaint in Doe v. Silsbee Independent School District. The plaintiff (\\"H.S.\\") was a cheerleader who was ordered by her high school to cheer for her alleged rapist, a basketball player named Rakheem Bolton. H.S. refused and was kicked off the team. She sued, claiming a violation of her First Amendment right to free speech. The Eastern District of Texas Judge Thad Heartfield granted the school district's motion to dismiss, and Judges Clement, Garza, and Owen affirmed. H.S. was ordered to pay the school $45,000 in legal fees for filing a \\"frivolous\\" lawsuit. See also *George W. Bush judicial appointment controversies *George W.

Also titled ·πØp·π≠ nhr (\\" the Judge of the River\\"),Smith (1994), p. 235. he is also one of the 'ilhm ( 'ilahuuma/'ilahiima Elohim) or sons of El, the name given to the Levantine pantheon. Of all the gods, despite being the champion of El, Yam holds special hostility against Baal Hadad, son of Dagon. Yam is a deity of the sea and his palace is in the abyss associated with the depths, or Biblical tehom, of the oceans. Yam is the deity of the primordial chaos and represents the power of the sea, untamed and raging; he is seen as ruling storms and the disasters they wreak, and was an important divinity to the maritime Phoenicians. The gods cast out Yam from the heavenly mountain Sappan (modern Jebel Aqra; Sappan is cognate to Tsephon). The fight of Baal-Hadad with Yam has long been equated with the Chaoskampf mytheme in Mesopotamian mythology in which a god fights and destroys a \\"dragon\\" or sea monster; the seven-headed dragon Lotan is associated closely with him and Yam is often described as the serpent.

Setting=Liavek Located on the southern shore of the Sea of Luck at the mouth of the Cat River, Liavek is a hot, busy trade city. Magic is present and based on a combination of 'birth luck' and the length of time one's mother was in labor. Everyone is privy to some luck, but using it to their advantage is no easy feat. On an annual basis, luck or magic must be invested in an object outside of oneself, and only then can it be used to power spells. Investment is difficult and dangerous, while not investing luck and magic will result in the magic draining away. This is more prevalent in magicians who will find their life drain away with the magic. https://www.amazon.com/Points-Departure- Patricia-C- Wrede/dp/1626815550/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1432142703&sr;=1-1&keywords;=Points+of+Departure%3A+Liavek+Storieshttps://www.npr.org/2015/05/16/406998251/the- gates-of-liavek-are-open-again-in-points-of-departure Works=Liavek Edited by Will Shetterly and Emma Bull, published by Ace Books in 1985 * Badu's Luck - Emma Bull * The Green Rabbit from S'Rian - Gene Wolfe * Ancient Curses - Patricia C.

The first is a superhero and his only appearance was in Superman # 163 (August 1963). The second is Hercules, who uses the name when he replaces Wonder Woman as the representative of the Olympian Gods in Wonder Woman v3, #3. The third is Dane of Elysium, who is a male version of Diana Prince that exists on Earth-11, where the genders of the superheroes are reversed. Other versions=Ajax Within the story, he appeared on the scene and eventually came to rival Superman, possessing the same powers as he, but not his weaknesses. His popularity surpassed Superman which left him depressed, feeling like a has-been. It was later revealed that Wonder Man used to be Ajax, one of Superman's duplicate robots that he used for help or hiding his identity. Ajax was kidnapped by the Superman Revenge Squad while in space, who turned him into a real living being while still having his bionic super- powers. The invaders wanted to use him to remove Superman so that he would no longer be in their way for their attack. Wonder Man, not being evil, thwarted their plan with Superman when he learned of their full intentions. After the aliens' defeat, Superman offered Wonder Man (who revealed to him his secret) the chance to fight at his side, but the aliens installed a death-mechanism in him that was triggered to kill him within a week. Wonder Man died, and then laid in a grave which said that he was born a robot, but died a human. Hercules Hercules appears during the events of One Year Later. Now shaven and bearing an updated version of the armour worn in the Hercules Unbound series, he replaces Wonder Woman as an agent of Olympus. He is referred to as \\"Wonder Man\\" by Cheetah and Nemesis. He temporarily set up his base in the Greek Embassy. In Wonder Woman v3 #4, Hercules is revealed to have lied about his reasons for returning to Earth and was actually partnering with Circe. Dane of Elysium Dane of Elysium was introduced in Countdown Presents: The Search for Ray Palmer - Superwoman/Batwoman #1 (2008) as an inhabitant of Earth-11, which is home to reverse-gendered superheroes. He is the reverse gender of New Earth's Diana Prince. It is revealed that Dane was exiled from \\"Woman's World\\" when he killed Maxine Lord on national television for controlling Superwoman. He eventually led his male Amazons into battle against the United States, but was defeated by Superwoman and the Justice League. Following the Flashpoint (2011) reboot, Earth 11's gender-reversed Wonder Woman is Wonderous Man, as shown in The Multiversity Guidebook (2015).

Although it had a tortuous publication history after Franklin's death, this work has become one of the most famous and influential examples of an autobiography ever written. Franklin's account of his life is divided into four parts, reflecting the different periods at which he wrote them. There are actual breaks in the narrative between the first three parts, but Part Three's narrative continues into Part Four without an authorial break. In the \\"Introduction\\" of the 1916 publication of the Autobiography, editor F. W. Pine wrote that Franklin's biography provided the \\"most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men\\" with Franklin as the greatest exemplar. Summary= Part One  Part One of the Autobiography is addressed to Franklin's son William, at that time (1771) Royal Governor of New Jersey. While in England at the estate of the Bishop of St Asaph in Twyford, Franklin, now 65 years old, begins by saying that it may be agreeable to his son to know some of the incidents of his father's life; so with a week's uninterrupted leisure, he is beginning to write them down for William. He starts with some anecdotes of his grandfather, uncles, father and mother. He deals with his childhood, fondness for reading, and service as an apprentice to his brother James Franklin, a Boston printer and publisher of the New- England Courant. After improving his writing skills through study of the Spectator by Joseph Addison and Sir Richard Steele, he writes an anonymous paper and slips it under the door of the printing house by night. Not knowing its author, James and his friends praise the paper and it is published in the Courant, which encourages Ben to produce more essays (the \\"Silence Dogood\\" essays), which are also published. When Ben reveals his authorship, James is angered, thinking the recognition of his papers will make Ben too vain. James and Ben have frequent disputes, and Ben seeks a way to escape from working under James. Eventually James gets in trouble with the colonial assembly, which jails him for a short time and then forbids him to continue publishing his paper. James and his friends come up with the stratagem that the Courant should hereafter be published under the name of Benjamin Franklin, although James will still actually be in control. James signs a discharge of Ben's apprenticeship papers but writes up new private indenture papers for Ben to sign which will secure Ben's service for the remainder of the agreed time. But when a fresh disagreement arises between the brothers, Ben chooses to leave James, correctly judging that James will not dare to produce the secret indenture papers. (\\"It was not fair in me to take this Advantage\\", Franklin comments, \\"and this I therefore reckon one of the first Errata of my life\\".) James does, however, make it impossible for Ben to get work anywhere else in Boston. Sneaking onto a ship without his father or brother's knowledge, Ben heads for New York City, but the printer William Bradford is unable to employ him; however, he tells Ben that his son Andrew, a Philadelphia printer, may be able to use him since one of his son's principal employees had just died. By the time Ben reaches Philadelphia, Andrew Bradford has already replaced his employee but refers Ben to Samuel Keimer, another printer in the city, who is able to give him work. The Governor, Sir William Keith, takes notice of Franklin and offers to set him up in business for himself. On Keith's recommendation, Franklin goes to London for printing supplies, but when he arrives, he finds that Keith has not written the promised letter of recommendation for him, and that \\"no one who knew him had the smallest Dependence on him\\". Franklin finds work in London until an opportunity arises of returning to Philadelphia as an assistant to Thomas Denham, a Quaker merchant; but when Denham takes ill and dies, he returns to manage Keimer's shop. Keimer soon comes to feel that Franklin's wages are too high and provokes a quarrel which causes the latter to quit. At this point a fellow employee, Hugh Meredith, suggests that Franklin and he set up a partnership to start a printing shop of their own; this is subsidized by funds from Meredith's father, though most of the work is done by Franklin as Meredith is not much of a press worker and is given to drinking. They establish their business, and plan to start a newspaper, but when Keimer hears of this plan, he rushes out a paper of his own, the Pennsylvania Gazette. This publication limps along for three quarters of a year before Franklin buys the paper from Keimer and makes it \\"extremely profitable\\". (The Saturday Evening Post traces its lineage to Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette.) The partnership also receives an appointment as printer for the Pennsylvania assembly. When Hugh Meredith's father experiences financial setbacks and cannot continue backing the partnership, two friends separately offer to lend Franklin the money he needs to stay in business; the partnership amicably dissolves as Meredith goes to North Carolina, and Franklin takes from each friend half the needed sum, continuing his business in his own name. In 1730 he marries Deborah Read, and after this, with the help of the Junto, he draws up proposals for Library Company of Philadelphia. At this point Part One breaks off, with a memo in Franklin's writing noting that \\"The Affairs of the Revolution occasion'd the Interruption\\".  Part Two  The second part begins with two letters Franklin received in the early 1780s while in Paris, encouraging him to continue the Autobiography, of which both correspondents have read Part One. (Although Franklin does not say so, there had been a breach with his son William after the writing of Part One, since the father had sided with the Revolutionaries and the son had remained loyal to the British Crown.) At Passy, a suburb of Paris, Franklin begins Part Two in 1784, giving a more detailed account of his public library plan. He then discusses his \\"bold and arduous Project of arriving at moral Perfection\\", listing thirteen virtues he wishes to perfect in himself. He creates a book with columns for each day of the week, in which he marks with black spots his offenses against each virtue.\\"Project for Moral Pefection\\" Study Guide at What So Proudly We Hail Curriculum Of these virtues, he notices that Order is the hardest for him to keep. He eventually realizes that perfection is not to be attained, but feels himself better and happier because of his attempt.  Part Three  Beginning in August 1788 when Franklin had returned to Philadelphia, the author says he will not be able to utilize his papers as much as he had expected, since many were lost in the recent Revolutionary War. He has, however, found and quotes a couple of his writings from the 1730s that survived. One is the \\"Substance of an intended Creed\\" consisting of what he then considered to be the \\"Essentials\\" of all religions. He had intended this as a basis for a projected sect but, Franklin says, did not pursue the project. In 1732, Franklin first publishes his Poor Richard's Almanac, which becomes very successful. He also continues his profitable newspaper. In 1734, a preacher named Rev. Samuel Hemphill arrives from County Tyrone Ireland; Franklin supports him and writes pamphlets on his behalf. However, someone finds out that Hemphill has been plagiarizing portions of his sermons from others, although Franklin rationalizes this by saying he would rather hear good sermons taken from others than poor sermons of the man's own composition. Franklin studies languages, reconciles with his brother James, and loses a four-year-old son to smallpox. Franklin's club, the Junto, grows and breaks up into subordinate clubs. Franklin becomes Clerk of the General Assembly in 1736 thus entering politics for the first time, and the following year becomes Comptroller to the Postmaster General, which makes it easier to get reports and fulfill subscriptions for his newspaper. He proposes improvements to the city' watch and fire prevention regulations. The famed preacher George Whitefield arrives in 1739, and despite significant differences in their religious beliefs, Franklin assists Whitefield by printing his sermons and journals and lodging him in his house. As Franklin continues to succeed, he provides the capital for several of his workers to start printing houses of their own in other colonies. He makes further proposals for the public good, including some for the defense of Pennsylvania, which cause him to contend with the pacifist position of the Quakers. In 1740 he invents the Franklin stove, refusing a patent on the device because it was for \\"the good of the people\\". He proposes an academy, which opens after money is raised by subscription for it and it expands so much that a new building has to be constructed for it. Franklin obtains other governmental positions (city councilman, alderman, burgess, justice of the peace) and helps negotiate a treaty with the Indians. After helping Dr. Thomas Bond establish a hospital, he helps pave the streets of Philadelphia and draws up a proposal for Dr. John Fothergill about doing the same in London. In 1753 Franklin becomes Deputy Postmaster General. The next year, as war with the French is expected, representatives of the several colonies, including Franklin, meet with the Indians to discuss defense; Franklin at this time draws up a proposal for the union of the colonies, but it is not adopted. General Braddock arrives with two regiments, and Franklin helps him secure wagons and horses, but the general refuses to take Ben's warning about danger from hostile Indians during Braddock's planned march to Frontenac (now Kingston, Ontario). When Braddock's troops are subsequently attacked, the general is mortally wounded and his forces abandon their supplies and flee. A militia is formed on the basis of a proposal by Benjamin Franklin, and the governor asks him to take command of the northwestern frontier. With his son as aide de camp, Franklin heads for Gnadenhut, raising men for the militia and building forts. Returning to Philadelphia, he is chosen colonel of the regiment; his officers honor him by personally escorting him out of town. This attention offends the proprietor of the colony (Thomas Penn, son of William Penn) when someone writes an account of it in a letter to him, whereupon the proprietor complains to the government in England about Franklin. Now the Autobiography discusses \\"the Rise and Progress of [Franklin's] Philosophical Reputation.\\" He starts experiments with electricity and writes letters about them that are published in England as a book. Franklin's description of his experiments is translated into French, and Abb√© Nollet, who is offended because this work calls into question his own theory of electricity, publishes his own book of letters attacking Franklin. Declining to respond on the grounds that anyone could duplicate and thus verify his experiments, Franklin sees another French author refute Nollet, and as Franklin's book is translated into other languages, its views are gradually accepted and Nollet's are discarded. Franklin is also voted an honorary member of the Royal Society. A new governor arrives, but disputes between the assembly and the governor continue. (Since the colonial governors are bound to fulfill the instructions issued by the colony's proprietor, there is a continuing struggle for power between the legislature and the governor and proprietor.) The assembly is on the verge of sending Franklin to England to petition the King against the governor and proprietor, but meanwhile Lord Loudoun arrives on behalf of the English government to mediate the differences. Franklin nevertheless goes to England accompanied by his son, after stopping at New York and making an unsuccessful attempt to be recompensed by Loudoun for his outlay of funds during his militia service. They arrive in England on July 27, 1757.  Part Four  Written sometime between November 1789 and Franklin's death on April 17, 1790, this section is very brief. After Franklin and his son arrive in London, the former is counselled by Dr. Fothergill on the best way to advocate his cause on behalf of the colonies. Franklin visits Lord Grenville, president of the King's Privy Council, who asserts that the king is the legislator of the colonies. Franklin then meets the proprietaries (the switch to the plural is Franklin's, so apparently others besides Thomas Penn are involved). But the respective sides are far from any kind of agreement. The proprietaries ask Franklin to write a summary of the colonists' complaints; when he does so, their solicitor for reasons of personal enmity delays a response. Over a year later, the proprietaries finally respond to the assembly, regarding the summary to be a \\"flimsy Justification of their Conduct.\\" During this delay the assembly has prevailed on the governor to pass a taxation act, and Franklin defends the act in English court so that it can receive royal assent. While the assembly thanks Franklin, the proprietaries, enraged at the governor, turn him out and threaten legal action against him; in the last sentence, Franklin tells us the governor \\"despis'd the Threats, and they were never put in Execution\\".  Publication history  Title page of the original edition of the autobiography in French. The Autobiography remained unpublished during Franklin's lifetime. In 1791, the first edition appeared, in French rather than English, as M√©moires de la vie priv√©e de Benjamin Franklin, published in Paris. This translation of Part One only was based on a flawed transcript made of Franklin's manuscript before he had revised it. This French translation was then retranslated into English in two London publications of 1793, and one of the London editions served as a basis for a retranslation into French in 1798 in an edition which also included a fragment of Part Two. The first three parts of the Autobiography were first published together (in English) by Franklin's grandson, William Temple Franklin, in London in 1818, in Volume 1 of Memoirs of the Life and Writings of Benjamin Franklin. W. T. Franklin did not include Part Four because he had previously traded away the original hand- written holograph of the Autobiography for a copy that contained only the first three parts. Furthermore, he felt free to make unauthoritative stylistic revisions to his grandfather's autobiography, and on occasion followed the translated and retranslated versions mentioned above rather than Ben Franklin's original text. W. T. Franklin's text was the standard version of the Autobiography for half a century, until John Bigelow purchased the original manuscript in France and in 1868 published the most reliable text that had yet appeared, including the first English publication of Part Four. In the 20th century, important editions by Max Ferrand and the staff of the Huntington Library in San Marino, California (Benjamin Franklin's Memoirs: Parallel Text Edition, 1949) and by Leonard W. Labaree (1964, as part of the Yale University Press edition of The Papers of Benjamin Franklin) improved on Bigelow's accuracy. In 1981, J. A. Leo Lemay and P.M. Zall produced The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin: A Genetic Text, attempting to show all revisions and cancellations in the holograph manuscript. This, the most accurate edition of all so far published, served as a basis for Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography: A Norton Critical Edition and for the text of this autobiography printed in the Library of America's edition of Franklin's Writings. The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin also became the first full- length audiobook in history, which was voiced by actor Michael Rye and released in 1969.  Reactions to the work  In Frank Woodworth Pine's introduction of the 1916 publication published by Henry Holt and Company, Pine wrote that Franklin's biography provided the \\"most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men\\" with Franklin as the greatest exemplar of the \\"self-made man\\". Franklin's Autobiography has received widespread praise, both for its historical value as a record of an important early American and for its literary style. It is often considered the first American book to be taken seriously by Europeans as literature. William Dean Howells in 1905 asserted that \\"Franklin's is one of the greatest autobiographies in literature, and towers over other autobiographies as Franklin towered over other men.\\" By the 1860s, use of the Autobiography and its depiction of Franklin's industry and relentless self-improvement had become widespread as an instructive model for youth. So much so that Mark Twain wrote an essay humorously castigating Franklin for having \\"brought affliction to millions of boys since, whose fathers had read Franklin's pernicious biography\\".Twain, Mark (1995). Essays and Sketches of Mark Twain, p. 58. Barnes & Noble, Inc. D. H. Lawrence wrote a notable invective against the \\"middle-sized, sturdy, snuff-coloured Doctor Franklin\\"Birch, Dinah, ed. (7th ed. 2009). The Oxford Companion to English Literature, p. 391. Oxford University Press. in 1923, finding considerable fault with Franklin's attempt at crafting precepts of virtue and at perfecting himself. Nevertheless, responses to The Autobiography have generally been more positive than Twain's or Lawrence's, with most readers recognizing it as a classic of literature and relating to the narrative voice of the author. In this work, Franklin's persona comes alive and presents a man whose greatness does not keep him from being down-to-earth and approachable, who faces up to mistakes and blunders (\\"errata\\") he has committed in life, and who presents personal success as something within the reach of anyone willing to work hard enough for it.

He earned acclaim for his work in silent film, and later pioneered the use of color in film for dramatic effect. Early years Menzies was born in New Haven, Connecticut to Scots immigrant parents, Charles A. and Helen originally from Aberfeldy, Scotland. He studied at Yale and the University of Edinburgh, and after serving in the United States Army during World War I he attended the Art Students League of New York. Career Menzies joined Famous Players-Lasky, later to evolve into Paramount Pictures, working in special effects and design. He quickly established himself in Hollywood with his elaborate settings for Robin Hood (1922), The Thief of Bagdad (1924), The Bat (1926), The Dove (1927), Sadie Thompson (1928), and Tempest (1928). In 1929, Menzies formed a partnership with producer Joseph M. Schenck to create a series of early sound short films visualizing great works of music, including a 10-minute version of Dukas's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, and created the production design and special effects for Schenck's feature film The Lottery Bride (1930). Menzies's work on The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938) prompted David O. Selznick to hire him for Gone with the Wind (1939).Memo from David O. Selznick, selected and edited by Rudy Behlmer, Viking Press, 1972, p.156. Selznick's faith in Menzies was so great that he sent a memorandum to everyone at Selznick International Pictures who was involved in the production reminding them that \\"Menzies is the final word\\" on everything related to Technicolor, scenic design, set decoration, and the overall look of the production.Memo from David O. Selznick, p.196. \\"Production designer\\" (which is sometimes used interchangeably with \\"art director\\") was coined specifically for Menzies, to refer to his being the final word on the overall look of the production; it was intended to describe his ability to translate Selznick's ideas to drawings and paintings from which he and his fellow directors worked. Menzies was the director of the burning of Atlanta sequence in Gone with the Wind. He also re-shot the Salvador Dal√≠ dream sequence of Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945).Dal√≠, Surrealism and cinema by Elliott H. King, Kamera Books, 2007, p. 85‚Äì86. In addition, Menzies directed dramas and fantasy films. He made two science-fiction films: Things to Come (1936), based on H.G. Wells' work for producer Alexander Korda which predicted war and technical advancement; and Invaders from Mars (1953), which mirrored many fears about aliens and outside threats to humanity in the 1950s. Death Shortly after completing his work as an associate producer on Around the World in 80 Days (1956), Menzies died of cancer. He was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Accolades At the first Academy Awards, held on May 16, 1929, Menzies won for Best Art Direction for The Dove and Tempest. The following year he was nominated in the same categories for his work on Bulldog Drummond, Alibi, and The Awakening, but lost to Cedric Gibbons. At the 12th Academy Awards held on February 29, 1940, Menzies won an Academy Honorary Award \\"for outstanding achievement in the use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood\\" in the production of Gone With the Wind. Legacy In 2005, Menzies was in the first group of art directors and production designers inducted into the Art Directors Guild Hall of Fame. Several of Menzies home movies are part of the collection of the Academy Film Archive and were preserved by the archive in 2015.

The series was directed by David Richardson, written and presented by Frank Delaney, produced by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and broadcast on BBC Two. The series was released on DVD in Europe and North America in 2004. Delaney also wrote a six-chapter companion book, extended with four tales from Irish mythology. Episodes=Series 1 #\\"Dawn of a Culture\\" #\\"Years of Affluence\\" #\\"Secrets of the Gods\\" #\\"Heroes in Defeat\\" Series 2 # \\"The Man with the Golden Shoes\\" covers the archaeological and historical evidence for the Celts and the extent of their civilisation across the European continent, including the two core periods of Celtic Culture (i.e. Hallstatt culture and La T√®ne culture). # \\"The Birth of Nations\\" shows the formation of the modern Celtic nations from the ashes of the Roman conquest and fall. # \\"A Pagan Trinity\\" discusses Celtic mythology, legend, and belief, and then the introduction of Christian faith to the Irish and Scots. # \\"The Open-Ended Curve\\" presents the distinctive physical art of the Celts, both ancient and modern. # \\"The Final Conflict\\" returns to history, presenting the conquest of the modern Celtic nations by neighbouring England and France, with a detailed review of the attempted destruction of the Welsh language, the Irish resistance and revolution, and the immigration of the Irish and others to North America. # \\"The Legacy\\" is a discussion on the degree to which modern people may view themselves as Celts, with examples of modern Celtic-inspired practices like military discipline and warfare, the Welsh Eisteddfod, modern Irish music and art, and the efforts of the Bretons and Cape Bretoners to preserve their native languages in the face of societal assimilation by their ruling nations. Some of this episode was filmed in Portmeirion, Wales and makes references to the 1960s series The Prisoner. Soundtrack The series introduced the music of Irish singer Enya to a wider audience. Enya, formerly a member of the Celtic music group Clannad, was commissioned by David Richardson to compose the score for the series. Each episode of the series begins with the series' theme song, \\"The Celts\\". Two episodes include music videos of Enya performing the songs \\"I Want Tomorrow\\" and \\"Aldebaran\\". The DVD includes an interview and musical performances by Enya. The soundtrack album for The Celts was first released in 1987 by BBC Records under the title Enya. It reached No.69 in the UK albums chart.UK official charts - Enya It was later reissued in North America by Atlantic Records. In 1992, Reprise Records, the licensees of Enya's later popular recordings such as \\"Orinoco Flow\\", obtained the rights to the Enya album and it was remastered and reissued under the title The Celts. This time the album reached No.10 in the UK. Also, Enya appeared in a new music video to promote the title song, and a CD-single of the theme song was released.

It is produced by Johnston Press, owners of Portsmouth Publishing & Printing, at their headquarters in North Harbour, Portsmouth, and printed in nearby Hilsea. Its official title is The News, though it was formerly known as The Portsmouth Evening News and still popularly referred to as The Evening News despite being printed in the early hours of the morning. The News is printed Monday to Saturday. There was also a weekly sports paper, The Sports Mail, which followed the fortunes of local club Portsmouth F.C. and local sports news. A weekend magazine and an entertainment supplement called WOW247 (formerly The Guide) are also printed. Sales have declined following price rises and the rise of social media. Like many regional newspapers The News' circulation has plummeted in recent years, slumping by 15% in the last six months of 2018 to 13,902. History The News began in the North East in 1873, when Samuel Storey MP founded The Echo in Sunderland. Together with six partners and an original investment of ¬£3,500, Storey hoped to produce an evening paper that reflected his radical views. Storey was elected into Parliament as the mayor, where he met future business partner Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish born millionaire. The partners, along with businessman, Passmore Edwards, arrived in Portsmouth in 1883 with intentions of buying out the Hampshire Telegraph and starting a new evening newspaper, the Southern Standard. By this time, The Evening News had already been established in Portsmouth by Graham Niven, who served as the paper's editor, manager, reporter and distributor. Both Storey and Niven faced a problem when they realised there was no room for two evening papers in Portsmouth. Niven soon sold out to Storey, retaining one quarter share. Storey's original project, The Southern Standard only survived for eight issues. When the Storey-Carnegie syndicate broke up in 1885, Storey invested in various other papers expanding his newspaper company to West Sussex, Chichester and the Isle of Wight. In 1903 Samuel Storey's son Frederick George took over from his father as the managing director of The Echo. When Frederick died in 1924 it was his son, also named Samuel Storey born in 1896, who was to begin the third generation of the Storey family in control of the newspaper group. The original founder of the group died in 1925. During his 49 years as chairman of his grandfather's company, which had since become Portsmouth and Sunderland Newspapers Limited (P&SN;), Lord Buckton guided the company through the technological advances of the 1950 and 1960s. Aided by his brother F.G.H Storey, P&SN; explored the new processes of photo-composition and web-offset printing. The final member of the Storey family to become chairman at the company was Sir Richard Storey, who stepped down in June 1998. Sir Stephen Waley-Cohen took over as chairman at P&SN; until the company was sold to Johnston Press in July 1999. The News has since remained in the control of Johnston Press, whose slogan is \\"Life is Local\\". In 2000 the paper launched the \\"We can do it\\" awards recognising \\"unsung heroes\\" in the community. OfficesThe former offices of The News, in Hilsea For many years, the newspaper was based out of offices in a former slaughterhouse in Portsmouth's Stanhope Road. In 1969, The News moved from the centre of Portsmouth to a new location in Hilsea, under the supervision of Ted Galpin, a Director and general manager (South) of P&SN.; Galpin was subsequently made an OBE for his services to the newspaper industry, an honour he dedicated to his staff. When Lord Buckton died in 1978 his son Richard (who inherited his father's baronetcy) assumed the role of chairman of the company. In 1982 an ¬£11 million plan to develop The News Centre was announced. This hoped to provide the latest equipment for editorial, marketing, production and administration departments. The extension was opened in 1983 by Kenelm Storey, the son of the former chairman, who became the fifth generation of the family to be involved with the company. In the following years, southern editions of a number of national newspapers have been printed at the News Centre, using the time when the presses are not needed to print evening papers. In April 2013, The News announced it would be closing its Hilsea headquarters and moving to new offices in Portsmouth's former IBM headquarters in North Harbour. The newspaper's newsroom, advertising, newspaper sales, finance, IT, and front counter staff moved to the new headquarters in June. However, the newspaper's printing press remains at the former site.

These weapons are characteristically too large for an individual to fire from the shoulder or often carry by themselves, but unlike artillery pieces, punt guns are able to be aimed and fired by a single person from a mount. In this case, the mount is typically a small watercraft. Many early models appear similar to over-sized versions of shoulder weapons of the time with full-length wooden stocks with a normal-sized shoulder stock. Most later variations do away with the full-length stock‚Äîespecially more modern models‚Äîand have mounting hardware fixed to the gun to allow them to be fitted to a pintle. Operation and usage Sighting a punt gun Punt guns were usually custom-designed and varied widely, but could have bore diameters exceeding and fire over a pound (‚âà 0.45 kg) of shot at a time.BASC - \\"Irish Tom\\" historic punt gun to be put on permanent display A single shot could kill over 50 waterfowl resting on the water's surface. They were too big to hold and the recoil was so large that they had to be mounted directly on punts used for hunting, hence their name. Hunters would manoeuvre their punts quietly into line and range of the flock using poles or oars to avoid startling them. Generally the gun was fixed to the punt; thus the hunter would manoeuvre the entire boat in order to aim the gun. The guns were sufficiently powerful, and the punts themselves sufficiently small, that firing the gun often propelled the punt backwards several inches or more. To improve efficiency, hunters could work in fleets of up to around ten punts. Punt guns are usually muzzle loaded with a lock similar to muskets or rifles of the day including flintlock, percussion, and more modern types. Holland and Holland offered models using breech loading and standardized shotgun shells in both brass and combined paper and brass base in the 1890s via custom order.https://www.africahunting.com/hunting/hunting-forums/holland- holland-1910-catalog.pdf Double-barreled models also existed, typically in the smaller 8-gauge loadings. In most cases, these guns were work-guns with little additional adornment in surviving examples. Many appearing in modern auctions have signs of being repaired or upgraded in some fashion, such as upgrading a flintlock action to a more modern percussion system or refinishing by rebluing the piece. Size comparison of a man and punt gun In the United States, this practice depleted stocks of wild waterfowl and by the 1860s most states had banned the practice. The Lacey Act of 1900 banned the transport of wild game across state lines, and the practice of market hunting was outlawed by a series of federal laws in 1918. While use and possession of punt guns is still legal in the United States, Federal regulations make them illegal for usage in migratory waterfowl hunting. According to Eunan O'Halpin's book Defending Ireland, a Local Defence Force unit of the Irish Army in Co. Louth was equipped in 1941 with a number of flintlock weapons that had been gifted to them. Among these guns was a weapon described as being a \\"nine-foot [long] blunderbuss\\", which could be more commonly understood to be a punt gun. In the United Kingdom, a 1995 survey showed fewer than 50 active punt guns still in use. The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 limits punt guns in England and Wales, and in Scotland, to a bore diameter of (1 1/8-pounder). Since Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee in 1897 there has been a punt gun salute every Coronation and Jubilee over Cowbit Wash in Cowbit, Lincolnshire, England. During the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II, 21 punt gun rounds were fired separately, followed by the guns all being fired simultaneously. Fictional usage Desmond Bagley's 1973 thriller, The Tightrope Men, features a percussion-fired punt gun. Although set in northern Finland, punt guns were never used in the country. In his 1978 novel Chesapeake, author James A. Michener details the historical use of various punt guns (described by him as ‚Äúlong guns‚Äù) and their impact on waterfowl numbers. One, called \\"The Twombly,\\" was described as 11 feet 6 inches long, 110 pounds (with a load of 3/4 lbs of black powder and over 1.5 lbs of number 6 shot), which was used to hunt geese and ducks by the highlighted watermen of the Chesapeake Bay. The 2004 film Tremors 4: The Legend Begins featured a punt gun used in combat. This punt gun was custom-built for the film and was long, weighed , and had a bore (classified as \\"A\\" gauge by the Gun Barrel Proof Act of 1868 in Schedule B). The weapon was not actually of this bore, instead being a large prop shell concealing a 12 gauge shotgun firing triple-loaded black powder blanks, with the barrel sprayed with WD-40 water displacer to produce a large smoke cloud on firing. In the novel Outer Dark, by Cormac McCarthy, the use of a four- gauge punt gun for hunting ducks is described. In the Discworld novel Pyramids, mention is made of a \\"Puntbow\\", essentially a combination of this weapon and a crossbow.

Biography  Austin was born in England on 18 March 1800, the son of an official in the Chatham Dockyard. In 1828, was dispatched on a scientific expedition in the Pacific Ocean under the command of Captain Henry Foster, with Austin as his first lieutenant. Foster explored the South Atlantic, and especially the South Shetland Islands. Foster drowned in 1831, in the Chagres River in Panama. After Foster's loss, the ship's command fell to Austin. On the expedition, the ship circumnavigated along the Southern Hemisphere and visited the River Plate, Isla de los Estados and South Georgia, before returning to Falmouth in 1830. Following the 1849 failure of Sir James Clark Ross's attempt to locate Franklin's lost expedition, Austin led an expedition in 1850 that also attempted to find the missing explorers. George F. McDougall was second master on board . Although the expedition located only traces of Franklin's presence, Austin is credited with organising successful sledging expeditions along the coasts of several North American Arctic islands, including the island of Bathurst, Byam Martin, Melville, and Prince of Wales. Between October 1850 and March 1851, members of the Resolute crew under Austin published at least five editions of a handwritten newspaper, The Illustrated Arctic News, during the wintering of the Resolute in what they identified as Barrow Strait.\\"The Illustrated Arctic News,\\" Upon the return of the Resolute to home port in England, the manuscript paper was printed in London in 1852.Roy Alden Atwood (1997). \\"Shipboard News: Nineteenth Century Handwritten Periodicals at Sea.\\" Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (80th, Chicago, Illinois, 30 July ‚Äì 3 August 1997) Addendum I.

The Scarborough Bluffs, also known as The Bluffs, is an escarpment in the Scarborough district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. There are nine parks along the bluffs, with Bluffers Park being the only one with a beach. Forming much of the eastern portion of Toronto's waterfront, the Scarborough Bluffs stands above the shoreline of Lake Ontario. At its highest point, the escarpment rises above the coastline and spans a length of . History The Scarborough Bluffs previously extended further along the coast of Lake Ontario, but its western fringe was leveled by explosives to make way for urban development. The French gave the name \\"Les grands Ecores\\", or tall points on the shore, to the cliffs. In the 1788 Plan of Toronto by Alexander Aitken, the bluffs were simply known as the High Lands. They became known as the Scarborough Highlands in 1793 named after Scarborough, North Yorkshire. This name was chosen by Elizabeth Simcoe, who was the wife of the first lieutenant governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe. The escarpment along Lake Ontario reminded Elizabeth Simcoe of the limestone cliffs in her hometown. In her diary, she wrote, \\"The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but I believe they are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough.\\" The name was later given to the entire township in 1796. In time, the cliffs became known as the Bluffs. A stylized version of The Bluffs was incorporated into the design of the flag of the former city of Scarborough. The Scarborough Bluffs formerly extended further west along the coastline of Lake Ontario towards the Toronto Harbour, but extensive areas along the western fringe were leveled by the use of explosives for the implementation of primarily industrial and some residential urban development. Even the existing formation has and continues to shrink considerably decade after decade due to consistent and dramatic erosion. The Bluffs have become a community meeting place for people of all ages. It features various recreational hiking and walking trails, as well as picnic tables, fire pits, places to pitch a tent, parking lots, a restaurant, and a large marina with a boating club. Geology The Bluffs run from the foot of Victoria Park Avenue in the west to the mouth of Highland Creek in the east, reaching as high as ‚Äî the equivalent of twenty-five storeys. However, the escarpment continues westward inland, running between Kingston Road and Queen Street East, pausing over the Don Valley, and continuing on the north side of Davenport Road. The escarpment forms part of the old shoreline of Glacial Lake Iroquois, formed after the last ice age, which left valuable geological records as the part of the escarpment by the lake eroded. The eroded alluvial deposits from the Bluffs then settled westward to form the Toronto Islands. Issues= Erosion  Erosion is a major issue in the preservation of the Scarborough Bluffs. The Scarborough Bluffs have been eroding at a rapid rate since residences have been built along the lake bluff tops. The million-dollar views have been prime real estate since the 1940s. The desire for a beautiful lakeside view and an affluent lifestyle led to a real estate boom along the Bluffs‚Äîthis resulted in a direct correlation of the accelerating rate of erosion.Eyles, N., et al. \\"Applied Sedimentology in an Urban Environment‚Äîthe Case of Scarborough Bluffs, Ontario: Canada's Most Intractable Erosion Problem.\\" Geoscience Canada 12.3 (1985). The eroding Bluffs have resulted in damaged private property and the need for public assets to be spent on repairs and corrective action. In summer 2008, chunks of the Bluffs had eroded to the point that one quarter of a cottage that the late actor and comedian Billy Van once owned, was left hanging on the cliff‚Äîthe cottage was deemed a safety hazard by Toronto city officials as a result. To combat erosion, boulders acting as armour, rocks, and trees were placed at the base. However, to place these rocks and trees, a beach must be created to allow trucks to access the cliff base which would involve leveling parts of the Bluffs, such as the aforementioned Bluffer's Park. The Cathedral Bluffs, which is an impressive portion of the Bluffs, was the result of continued erosion. In 2017, the Toronto Region Conservation Authority created the Scarborough Waterfront Project which aims to revamp about 11 kilometres of Scarborough Bluff's shoreline which includes the expansion of the existing beach by approximately 60 metres into Lake Ontario between Bluffer's Park and Meadowcliffe.  Safety  The Scarborough Bluffs have been a sought out destination for photographers and visitors to trek through. However, due to erosion and flooding, this leads to dangerous conditions; according to the Toronto Region Conservation Authority, numerous people ignore warning signage. Areas that appear to be stable can collapse. \\"In terms of the park areas or where people want to go right at the top of the Bluffs, it's completely safe as long as they stay on the appropriate side of the fence. It's when they go on the wrong side of the fence that it causes issue\\".O'Keefe, Lara. \\"They're not bluffing.

Parks View from atop the Scarborough Bluffs at Bluffers Park. The Bluffer's Park Yacht Club is visible to the left. A number of city parks are located along the bluffs from Victoria Park Avenue to Rouge River. Most are located on the top the bluffs, but some are located at the base along the shoreline with Lake Ontario. Development of parkland began with the then Borough of Scarborough prior to 1960, while some remained in private hands. From 1960 to 1978 the parks were acquired by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority which developed into today's current parks. Outside of the parks, many sections of the bluffs are on private property. * Bluffer's Park: only park along the Bluffs with direct access to the lake.

These versions are to be distinguished from the Gospel of the Hebrews which was one or more works found in the Early Church, but surviving only as fragmentary quotations in Greek and Latin texts. Some scholars consider all the rabbinical versions to be translated from the Greek or Latin of the canonical Matthew, for the purpose of Jewish apologetics.Brown This conclusion is not unanimous. Other scholars have provided linguistic and historic evidence of Shem Tov's Matthew coming from a much earlier Hebrew text that was later translated into Greek and other languages.

Shem Tov debated Cardinal Pedro de Luna (later Antipope Benedict XIII) on original sin and redemption in Pamplona, December 26, 1375, in the presence of bishops and learned theologians. Nine manuscripts of The Touchstone survive, though if an independent version of the text of Matthew used by Ibn Shaprut ever existed then it is lost. Spanish Jews of Ibn Shaprut's period were familiar with the New Testament in Latin. Jacob Ben Reuben in his Wars of the Lord translated Gilbert Crispin's Disputation of Jews and Christians from Latin into Hebrew, along with quotes from Matthew. Lasker (1998) remarks that \\"By the fourteenth century, most likely every Iberian anti-Christian Jewish polemicist knew Latin.\\" Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas made proficient use of Latin phrases. Profiat Duran (fl.1380-1420) had extensive knowledge of Latin Christian texts, and devoted a chapter of his Disgrace of the Gentiles (Klimat ha-goyim) to criticism of Jerome's Latin Vulgate. Hayyim ben Judah ibn Musa argued with Nicholas de Lyra in his Book of Shield and Spear (Sefer magen va-romah).Daniel J. Lasker in In Iberia and beyond: Hispanic Jews between cultures ed. Bernard Dov Cooperman 1998 p176 Likewise converts to Christianity such as Abner of Burgos (Alphonso of Valladolid, ca. 1270-1347) continued to write polemical, theological, philosophical, and scientific works in Hebrew. Shem Tov's The Touchstone (Eben = stone, bohan = test) has never been translated into English or published. It follows the model of Milhamoth ha-Shem of Jacob Ben Reuben in use of Matthew but contains not just sections of Matthew as Jacob Ben Reuben, but the whole text of Matthew and parts of Mark. George Howard excised the text of Matthew from among Shem Tov's comments and published it separately as The Gospel of Matthew according to a primitive Hebrew text (1987), and then a revised second edition Hebrew Gospel of Matthew (1995).William Horbury Appendix pp729 in A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew ed. . D. Davies, William David Davies, Dale C. Allison Shem Tov's quotations of Matthew in The Touchstone are marked by Jewish thought, and are interspaced with the comments of the author. As a consequence several scholars feel it is difficult to determine which parts are Shem Tov's commentary, and which parts are the actual text of the source he was quoting. Many scholars view the text as a mediaeval translation from the Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew, as well as being the likely source of all later Hebrew versions of Matthew prior to the 20th century. Where the Tetragrammaton occurs in Tanakh quotations, instead one finds a single Hebrew He (◊î) except in one place where the word \\"ha-shem\\" (◊î◊©◊ù, the name) is spelled out. There are some interesting readings of Matthew in The Touchstone.Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's \\"Hebrew Matthew\\" * Matt 12:37 \\"According to your words you will be judged, and according to your deeds you will be convicted.\\" * Matt 24:40-41 \\"40 Then if there shall be two ploughing in a field, one righteous and the other evil, the one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at a mill; one will be taken and the other left. This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the good from the evil.\\" * Matt 28:9 \\"As they were going Jesus passed before them saying: 'May the Name deliver you.'\\" * Matt 28:19-20 \\"Go and teach them to carry out all the things which I have commanded you forever.\\" * Mark 9:20-28 is placed into the text of Matthew between Matt 17:17 and 17:19. Matt 17:18 is omitted.http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol03/Petersen1998a.html Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's \\"Hebrew Matthew\\" While the quotations in Shem Tov's The Touchstone, which are interspersed in his own commentary, diverge from the canonical text of Matthew, the text of the M√ºnster Matthew and the Du Tillet Matthew are significantly very close to it in many passages. Sebastian M√ºnster's Matthew, 1537 The M√ºnster Matthew is a printed version of the Gospel of Matthew, written in Hebrew published by Sebastian M√ºnster in 1537 and dedicated to King Henry VIII of England. It is disputed as to whether M√ºnster‚Äòs prefatory language refers to an actual manuscript that he used. Horbury, William, ‚ÄúThe Hebrew Matthew and Hebrew Study,‚Äù in Hebrew Study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda (Edinburgh, 1999), 124-125 M√ºnster‚Äôs text closely resembles the Du Tillet Matthew. Since the places where M√ºnster altered the text are indeterminate, using the M√ºnster text for textual criticism is problematic. Jean du Tillet's Matthew, 1555 The Du Tillet Matthew is a version of the Gospel of Matthew, written in Hebrew, known as Heb.MSS.132, and residing in the National Library, Paris. The manuscript was obtained by Bishop Jean du Tillet from Italian Jews on a visit to Rome in 1553, and published in 1555, with editing by Jean Mercier (Hebraist) and addition of a Latin version, dedicated to cardinal Charles de Guise. While the text is less divergent from the Greek textual tradition than is the Shem Tov Matthew, this version share some deviations in common with the Shem Tov Matthew; for example, the Tetragrammaton is replaced with a sign composed of three yodhs or dots enclosed in a semicircle. Jean Cinqarbres (Quinquarboreus), Hebrew professor of the College Royal also worked on the Du Tillet Matthew. Rahabi Ezekiel's Matthew, 1750 Rabbi Rahabi Ezekiel's Ha-sepher shel we-'angilu shel ha- Nosarim shel Yeshu [The book of the Gospel belonging to the followers of Jesus] is a polemical translation of Matthew dating from 1750.Pinchas Lapide Hebrew in the church: the foundations of Jewish-Christian dialogue 1984 This may or may not be the same as the polemical rabbinical Hebrew New Testament of Rabbi Ezekiel bought by Claudius Buchanan in Cochin and known as the \\"Travancore Hebrew New Testament\\", which led Buchanan to urge Joseph Frey to commence work on a Christian translation.Shalom Goldman God's sacred tongue: Hebrew & the American imagination p108 2004 \\"In Travancore he purchased a large collection of Hebrew manuscripts that included both a chronicle of the Jews of Cochin and a Hebrew New Testament.

M. Paul Bauchet.\\" However the principal modern Hebrew version of Matthew is based on the New Testament of a German, Franz Delitzsch. Shem Tov's Touchstone in Christian Aramaic primacy debate The Hebrew and Aramaic primacy hypotheses posits that the Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic. Scholars who support these hypotheses sometimes appeal to these 3 medieval Hebrew manuscripts. However, the vast majority of scholars believe Matthew was originally written in Greek.Brown 1997, p. 210 \\"There are medieval Hebrew forms of Matt that most scholars think of as retroversions from the Greek of canonical Matt, often made to serve in arguments between Christians and Jews. However, some claim that these texts are a guide to the original Hebrew of Matt (French scholars like J. Carmignac and M. Dubarle have contributed to this thesis...) Still other scholars think they can reconstruct the original Hebrew or Aramaic underlying the whole or parts of the Greek text of canonical Matt on the assumption that the original was in Semitic... The vast majority of scholars, however, contend that the Gospel we know as Matt was composed originally in Greek and is not a translation of a Semitic original... Brown, Raymond E. An Introduction to the New Testament\\" George Howard, Associate Professor of Religion and Hebrew at the University of Georgia has argued (1995) that some or all of these three medieval Hebrew versions may have descended (without any intervening translation) from ancient Hebrew manuscripts of Matthew, which may have been used by early Christians in the 1st or 2nd century, but were nearly extinct by the time of Jerome, late in the 4th century.Howard 1995 However the surviving citations from Jewish- Christian Gospels (namely Gospel of the Nazarenes, Gospel of the Ebionites and Gospel of the Hebrews) preserved in the writings of Jerome, Epiphanius and others, lead critical scholars to conclude that those Gospels themselves either were Greek or were translated from Greek Matthew.Philipp Vielhauer section in NTA1 In fact, most scholars consider that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts were descended (by translation) from medieval Greek or Latin manuscripts, and therefore that it is extremely unlikely that any of the unique readings found in these medieval Hebrew manuscripts could be ancient. Petersen 1998 Horbury (1999)Horbury W. Hebrew study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda 1999 p129 \\"These features are probably to be explained, however, not, as Howard thinks, from the influence of a gospel in Hebrew current among the early Christians, but rather from the encounter of Jews over the years with various forms of gospel text in other languages;\\" notes that the characteristics of ibn Shaprut's Touchstone are better explained by the influence of Latin Gospel harmonies.

It explains the behavior of simultaneously taking suspensions and increasing the index of the homotopy groups of the space in question. It was proved in 1937 by Hans Freudenthal. The theorem is a corollary of the homotopy excision theorem. Statement of the theorem Let X be an n-connected pointed space (a pointed CW-complex or pointed simplicial set). The map :X \\\\to \\\\Omega(\\\\Sigma X) induces a map :\\\\pi_k(X) \\\\to \\\\pi_k(\\\\Omega(\\\\Sigma X)) on homotopy groups, where Œ© denotes the loop functor and Œ£ denotes the reduced suspension functor. The suspension theorem then states that the induced map on homotopy groups is an isomorphism if k ‚â§ 2n and an epimorphism if k = 2n + 1. A basic result on loop spaces gives the relation :\\\\pi_k(\\\\Omega (\\\\Sigma X)) \\\\cong \\\\pi_{k+1}(\\\\Sigma X) so the theorem could otherwise be stated in terms of the map :\\\\pi_k(X) \\\\to \\\\pi_{k+1}(\\\\Sigma X), with the small caveat that in this case one must be careful with the indexing. Proof As mentioned above, the Freudenthal suspension theorem follows quickly from homotopy excision; this proof is in terms of the natural map \\\\pi_k(X)\\\\to\\\\pi_{k+1}(\\\\Sigma X). If a space X is n-connected, then the pair of spaces (CX,X) is (n+1)-connected, where CX is the reduced cone over X; this follows from the relative homotopy long exact sequence. We can decompose \\\\Sigma X as two copies of CX, say (CX)_+, (CX)_-, whose intersection is X. Then, homotopy excision says the inclusion map: :((CX)_+, X)\\\\subset (\\\\Sigma X,(CX)_-) induces isomorphisms on \\\\pi_i, i < 2n+2 and a surjection on \\\\pi_{2n+2}. From the same relative long exact sequence, \\\\pi_i(X)=\\\\pi_{i+1}(CX,X), and since in addition cones are contractible, :\\\\pi_i(\\\\Sigma X,(CX)_-)=\\\\pi_i(\\\\Sigma X). Putting this all together, we get :\\\\pi_i(X)=\\\\pi_{i+1}((CX)_+,X)=\\\\pi_{i+1}((\\\\Sigma X,(CX)_-)=\\\\pi_{i+1}(\\\\Sigma X) for i+1<2n+2, i.e. i\\\\leqslant 2n, as claimed above; for i=2n+1 the left and right maps are isomorphisms, regardless of how connected X is, and the middle one is a surjection by excision, so the composition is a surjection as claimed. Corollary 1 Let Sn denote the n-sphere and note that it is (n ‚àí 1)-connected so that the groups \\\\pi_{n+k}(S^n) stabilize for n \\\\geqslant k+2 by the Freudenthal theorem. These groups represent the kth stable homotopy group of spheres. Corollary 2 More generally, for fixed k ‚â• 1, k ‚â§ 2n for sufficiently large n, so that any n-connected space X will have corresponding stabilized homotopy groups. These groups are actually the homotopy groups of an object corresponding to X in the stable homotopy category. References *. *. * *.

Growing ever dissatisfied with the rock scene in Mexico, he opted to retire, but not before he distributed a home-made tape simply called \\"Familia Carbajal\\", where his expanding abilities as composer were evidenced. In 1997 \\"Jericho\\" appeared in CD format, making it accessible for a new generation of listeners from around the world.

He is known for his work on migration, cultural diffusion and time geography. A native and resident of Sweden, H√§gerstrand was a professor (later professor emeritus) of geography at Lund University, where he received his doctorate in 1953. His doctoral research was on cultural diffusion. His research has helped to make Sweden, and particularly Lund, a major center of innovative work in cultural geography. He also influenced the practice of spatial planning in Sweden through his students. Early life H√§gerstrand's father was a teacher at a remote elementary school and the family lived at the school. H√§gerstrand recalled that his early education was based on the pedagogical ideas of Swiss educator Johann Pestalozzi. Several of H√§gerstrand's students speculated that his holistic and visionary thinking was rooted in his early education:; > He was taught local geography, history and folklore at home in the > Pestalozzi tradition which was being introduced at that time. Cartography, > geology, botany and agronomy were all interrelated parts of a more holistic > understanding of processes within a spatial area. To start with, children > learned about their immediate environment (e.g., the school room and the > farm), then about the village, and gradually the whole district. As a pupil > of H√§gerstrand, it is easy for me to recognize parts of this tradition which > later became what we today would refer to as an 'integrative perspective'. Academic career H√§gerstrand entered Lund University in 1937. His 1953 doctoral thesis Innovation Diffusion as a Spatial Process gained fame for its innovative use of Monte Carlo simulation of demographic development.; ; It showed how dynamic, incremental simulation of spatial processes could be used at the spatial scale of the individual as well as large spatial aggregates. Forty years later, geographer Andrew Cliff remarked on the foresight of H√§gerstrand's methodology: \\"Bearing in mind that much of the research upon which the book is based dates from a time when computers were almost nonexistent, let alone used by geographers, it is remarkable that the simulation methodology which is so critically dependent upon computing power should have been contemplated.\\" H√§gerstrand's research was aided by developments at Lund University, notably the establishment of the Siffermaskinen i Lund (SMIL), one of Sweden's first computers. H√§gerstrand noted that the Swedish computer scientist Carl-Erik Fr√∂berg, who had been H√§gerstrand's \\"school-mate since secondary school\\", had introduced him to the Monte Carlo method that would define his doctoral thesis, following a trip by Fr√∂berg and other young Swedish scientists to the United States, a trip that was financed by the Swedish government's project to build its own computer. In 1969, he presented a paper titled \\"What about People in Regional Science?\\" to the European Congress of the Regional Science Association in Copenhagen, Denmark. This paper, published in 1970, developed two concepts: * The need to study the individual in order to understand social and group practices. Modern cultural geographers commonly now study everyday practices on an individualistic basis, in order to understand larger scale patterns. The study of just groups creates a homogenization of reality and hides the truth. * A link between space and time that had previously been poorly developed. Historically, social scientists had treated time as a relevant but external factor to spatial features. H√§gerstrand's early work on innovation diffusion (studying the geographical spread of new technologies) made him realise that the two, though separate, were not independent of each other; they have what French theorist Henri Lefebvre would call a dialectical relationship. Legacy H√§gerstrand's initial work was primarily quantitative, which is important as the discipline of geography was, when he published his first paper in 1942, a highly descriptive subject. In the 1950s he was a pioneer of geocoding statistical primary data. He developed models and statistical techniques, such as the time‚Äìspace cube and time‚Äìspace prism, which later became important in the development of geographic information systems that process and visualize movement data.For example: ; ; ; ; ; ; His work informed the likes of Allan Pred and Nigel Thrift, who helped take it to the English speaking world.; ; H√§gerstrand's work contributed to the introduction of humanistic thought into geography, which led to the development of critical geography.Christiaan van Paassen, The philosophy of geography: from Vidal to H√§gerstrand, in While his early work was largely quantitative, H√§gerstrand's later work paid closer attention to notions of embodiment and emotion.; Still, his methods were critiqued by feminist geographer Gillian Rose, who claimed that his models showed a masculine and falsely-ordered view of the world. More recent geographers have tried to combine time geography with the qualitative research and affective phenomenology of feminist geography.For example: ; ; ; ; Development of H√§gerstrand's work has continued to form part of the basis for non-representational theory, and a reappraisal of his work by new generations of social scientistsFor example: ; ; ; ; ; and biologistsFor example: ; ; means that he remains an influential thinker today. In 2005, Nigel Thrift summarized five benefits of H√§gerstrand's time geography for contemporary social science: > First, it provides a sense of concreteness, of the power of 'thereness', and > it does so in a way‚Äîvisually‚Äîthat is still the preserve of too few social > theorists. All those intricate diagrams were, in part, an attempt to > describe the pragmatics of events, a theme which has now, in the work of > writers like Deleuze, become fashionable in the social sciences and > humanities but, at the time at which H√§gerstrand was working, tended to be > restricted to the field of philosophy, except for the work of social > interactionists and ethnomethodologists which was often very imperfectly > understood by other than a relatively small coterie of enthusiasts. > Secondly, H√§gerstrand's work was an attack on the Durkheimian idea that > space and time were social categories, collective representations which both > derived from society and also dictated to society. [...] Time-geography > makes it possible to go beyond social constructionism by emphasizing the > physical constraints on human action and the wider networks of competing > opportunities that they set up which act to steer situations. [...] Thirdly, > and as a directly related point, those time-geographic diagrams did > something else too. They radically lessened the distinction between humans > and other objects. They provided a kind of neutrality of representation, > even a democracy of description, of the world. [...] Fourthly, H√§gerstrand's > work espoused a geographical ethics, centred on the wise use of space and > time. Although H√§gerstrand would often use economic metaphors to describe > that wisdom in the use of space and time, I am sure that he meant something > broader and more encompassing which it seems to me to be well worth keeping > hold of, a kind of democratic ethos of the cardinal dimensions, a > conviviality in the use of space and time. Fifthly, H√§gerstrand provided a > language which could register the world in different ways. Perhaps one way > of looking at H√§gerstrand's work is as a means of saying 'hello' in a > language many can understand: drawing as a kind of visual Esperanto. Honors He received honorary doctorates from University of Bergen, Norwegian school of economics and business administration, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Bristol, University of Edinburgh, University of Glasgow and Ohio State University. The commendation accompanying the honorary degree at Ohio State University noted that \\"his work on innovation diffusion, carried out in the 1950s and 1960s, continues to be cited as a standard against which current research is measured\\" and that \\"this distinguished individual...inspired a generation of scholars around the world.\\" He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters, the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters, the Finnish Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy, and a member of Soci√©t√© de G√©ographie in France. He was also one of the founding members of Academia Europaea. In 1968 Professor H√§gerstrand was awarded the Charles P. Daly Medal of the American Geographical Society and in 1968 received an Outstanding Achievement Award from the Association of American Geographers. In 1979 he received the Victoria Medal from the Royal Geographical Society.

Meadow-rue is a common name for plants in this genus. Thalictrum is a taxonomically difficult genus with poorly understood species boundaries; it is in need of further taxonomic and field research for clarification. Despite their common name of \\"meadow-rue\\", Thalictrum species are not closely related to the true rue (family Rutaceae), but resemble its members in having compound leaves twice or thrice divided.  Description  Meadow-rue leaves are alternate, bipinnately compound, and commonly glaucous blue-green in colour. The flowers are small and apetalous (no petals), but have numerous long stamens, often brightly white, yellow, pink or pale purple, and are produced in conspicuous dense inflorescences. In some species (e.g. T. chelidonii, T. tuberosum), the sepals are large, brightly coloured and petal-like, but in most they are small and fall when the flower opens or soon after. Habitat and distribution Meadow-rues are usually found in shaded or damp locations, with a sub-cosmopolitan range throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere and also south to southern Africa and tropical South America, but absent from Australasia. They are most common in temperate regions of the world; twenty- two species are found in North America. Ecology Anemophily (wind pollination) is a characteristic of some members this genus, as seen in Thalictrum fendleri and Thalictrum dioicum. Others, such as Thalictrum sparsiflorum, are entomophilous (pollinated by insects). Thalictrum species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the Setaceous Hebrew Character moth. Chemical constituents Thalictrum species have been extensively studied by chemists. Typical natural products found in this genus are benzylisoquinoline alkaloids such as magnoflorine and the structurally related alkaloid berberine.

Some of Marvel's \\"edgier\\" (more adult) titles were moved into the Marvel Edge imprint. These included titles featuring such characters as Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Ghost Rider, the Hulk, Nick Fury, and the Punisher. Marvel Edge was discontinued right before the Onslaught Saga (comics cover-dated May 1996).  History  Following an inter-office shake-up in late 1994, Tom DeFalco was removed as Marvel's Editor-in-Chief.\\"Newswatch: DeFalco Resigns from Marvel\\". The Comics Journal (Fantagraphics Books) (174): 25. February 1995. Rather than name a successor, Marvel appointed five \\"Editors-in-Chief,\\" each of whom would oversee a certain number of titles and, by extension, a certain portion of the Marvel Universe. This change was reflected externally by collecting all Marvel monthlies into broad groups: the X-Men titles, the Spider-Man titles, and three new imprints, one of them being Marvel Edge, which was overseen by Bobbie Chase. The imprint was launched with the storyline \\"Over the Edge,\\" (beginning in comics cover-dated September 1995) in which The Punisher went temporarily insane. He became convinced Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. were responsible for the death of his family, and pursued Fury through various titles which would form the core of the imprint, finally killing him. This led to a relaunch of the Punisher title, where the mafia faked Frank Castle's execution and recruited him as a mob boss.

He pitched for the Oakland Athletics, Chicago Cubs, and Texas Rangers of Major League Baseball. Early years Harden attended Claremont Secondary School in Victoria, British Columbia. He was a childhood friend and neighbor of Olympic diver Riley McCormick. Harden was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the 38th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball Draft, but instead attended Central Arizona College, which he graduated in 2001. While there he played baseball alongside future MLB All- Star second baseman Ian Kinsler. He led all NJCAA Division I pitchers with 127 strikeouts in 2001, and his ERA of 2.14 was the 5th lowest in the nation. In his first professional season as a 19-year-old with the Vancouver Canadians in Single-A, Harden had a 2‚Äì4 record in 18 games (14 starts), a 3.39 ERA, allowed only 47 hits and struck out 100 batters in 74 innings. Professional career=Draft and minor leagues Harden was drafted by the Athletics in the 17th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft, and signed by the team on May 28, 2001, shortly after graduating. In 2002, Harden began the year with the Single-A Visalia Oaks of the California League and was very impressive in 12 starts, as he had a 4‚Äì3 record with an ERA of 2.91, and struck out 85 batters in 68 innings. Halfway through the 2002 season, Harden was promoted to the Double-A Midland RockHounds of the Texas League, where he continued his impressive season, earning a record of 8‚Äì3, with an ERA of 2.95 in 16 starts. He also struck out 102 batters in 85 innings. His combined 2002 stats were 12‚Äì6, 2.93 ERA, 187 strikeouts and 75 walks in 153 innings. Harden began the 2003 season with Midland, and in 2 games, he had a 2‚Äì0 record and pitched 13 perfect innings, striking out 17 along the way. He was then promoted to the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats of the Pacific Coast League, where he pitched very well. In 16 games, 14 of which he started, Harden went 9‚Äì4 with an ERA of 3.15. Overall, Harden finished with a combined 11‚Äì4 record, 2.74 ERA, 107 strikeouts and 35 walks in 102 innings in the Minor leagues during the 2003 season. He was then promoted to the Oakland Athletics in July 2003. Oakland Athletics (2003‚Äì2008) Harden made his major league debut on July 21, 2003, against the Kansas City Royals. He held the Royals to only one run on four hits in seven innings, earning a no decision. Through Harden's first five starts, he had a 3‚Äì1 record, with an ERA of 1.69. In his next two, he allowed six runs in four innings against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 21, and then eight runs in 2.2 innings on August 26 against the Boston Red Sox. He finished the season with a 5‚Äì4 record and an ERA of 4.46. Harden pitched in two games in relief with the Athletics in their Division Series matchup with the Red Sox. In his playoff debut on October 1, Harden earned the win, pitching a scoreless inning. However in his second appearance, he pitched only one-third of an inning, and allowed two runs and was tagged with the loss. Harden began the 2004 season with the Sacramento River Cats, coming out of spring training as the A's 5th starter. But the Athletics had two off days in the first eight days of the season, and they optioned him down to get a start in the minor leagues. He pitched in one game, losing 5‚Äì3 to the Edmonton Trappers. The Athletics called him up on April 10, and he put together a very solid season with an 11‚Äì7 record and an ERA of 3.99. Harden compiled an 8‚Äì2 record and an ERA of 3.49 after the All-Star break. He ranked 8th in the AL with 167 strikeouts, and was tied for 7th with 81 walks. Harden allowed just 16 home runs in 189.2 innings, an average of 0.76 per nine innings, which was tied for 4th lowest in the American League. He threw the fastest fastball of all major league starters, averaging 94.3 miles per hour. In 2005, Harden began the season with the Athletics, but was sidelined with an oblique injury, and missed more than a month. Harden came back and pitched a two-hit game against the Texas Rangers on July 14, in which he allowed no runs for 7+ innings. One month later on August 14, Harden allowed only one hit, but received a no decision, en route to a 2‚Äì1 loss against the Minnesota Twins. On August 19, Harden had a 10‚Äì5 record with an ERA of 2.63, until he injured his right shoulder, sidelining him until September 25, by which time the Athletics were already out of the playoff hunt. Harden appeared in three games late in the season, pitching 5 innings of shutout ball, striking out seven and walking one. He finished the year with a 10‚Äì5 win-loss record, an ERA of 2.57 and 121 strikeouts in 128 innings. He allowed only seven HR's all season long, and despite the injuries, he emerged as the ace of the Oakland Athletics pitching staff. In 2006, Harden had two lengthy stints on the DL, spending most of the season there. He came back from the DL on September 21, 2006, for a short but outstanding start, going 3 innings allowing 1 run and recording 7 strikeouts, while finishing the season with a 4‚Äì0 record. He started off the 2007 season with a win against the Seattle Mariners, going 7 innings, striking out 7, and allowing two walks and two hits, before returning to the DL, on April 23. After another injury-plagued season, Harden started off the 2008 season with a strong start against the Boston Red Sox, pitching six strong innings and giving up a run and three hits while walking three and striking out nine batters. However, after his second start, he was again placed on the disabled list. Harden was activated on May 11 and struggled in his return allowing 8 hits and 5 runs in 3.2 innings and earning a no decision. In Harden's next start against his former teammate Tim Hudson and the Atlanta Braves, he pitched 7 innings only allowing 4 hits and 1 run while earning the win. In this start against the Braves on May 17, Harden also achieved his first major league hit. On June 8, 2008, he became the 38th pitcher to strike out three batters on nine pitches. This was done in the first inning, against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Rich Harden pitches to Darin Erstad of the Chicago White Sox during Oakland's home opener, 2007. Chicago Cubs (2008‚Äì2009) Harden pitching for the Cubs in 2008 Harden was traded to the Chicago Cubs on July 8, 2008, in a six-player deal. The Cubs traded Matt Murton, Eric Patterson, Sean Gallagher, and Josh Donaldson to Oakland for Harden and Chad Gaudin. He made his Cubs debut on July 12, against the San Francisco Giants, leaving the game with a 7‚Äì0 lead after pitching scoreless inning and striking out 10. Though the Cubs won 8‚Äì7, Harden earned a no decision after Carlos M√°rmol was unable to hold a five-run lead in the ninth. Harden registered ten strikeouts and allowed only one run in both of his following starts, but was not able to earn a win. He finally recorded his first win as a Cub on July 31, 2008, against the Milwaukee Brewers. At this point, Harden had the highest winning percentage among all starting pitchers over the last three years, with a record of 15‚Äì4 (.789).Chuck, Bill. 100 random things Harden finished the 2008 season with a record of 10‚Äì2. about the Red Sox, Rays, and Yankees, The Boston Globe. Published April 2, 2009. On October 8, 2008, the Cubs picked up the $7 million option in Harden's contract for the 2009 season. Texas Rangers (2010) On December 10, 2009, Harden signed with the Texas Rangers to a one year, $6.5 million contract, with a mutual option for 2011. Harden struggled in 2010 with a 5.68 ERA through 13 starts. He threw more pitches per inning than any starter in the league. He was put on the DL in June with a gluteal strain and returned to the rotation on July 31, pushing Scott Feldman to the bullpen. On August 23, 2010, the Texas Rangers combined for innings of no-hit ball on the Minnesota Twins, in which Rich Harden pitched innings but was pulled after throwing 111 pitches. Neftal√≠ Feliz eventually gave up the first hit for the Twins with one out in the ninth, a single to catcher Joe Mauer. Texas won the game, 4‚Äì0. On October 9, 2010, Harden was released by the Texas Rangers after being left off the post-season roster. The Rangers were playing the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALDS at the time. Harden finished the season with a record of 5‚Äì5 and a 5.58 ERA. Second stint with the Oakland Athletics (2011) Harden rejoined the Athletics on a one-year contract in 2011. On July 30, 2011, Oakland agreed to trade Harden to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for Triple-A First Baseman Lars Anderson and a player to be named later. That deal, however, fell through after the Red Sox front office reviewed Harden's medical records and determined that it was unlikely he would make it through the season without injury. Harden remained with the Athletics through the next day's non-waiver trade deadline. He finished the year at 4‚Äì4 over fifteen games with a 5.12 ERA but a high 9.91 strikeouts per nine innings. The Athletics declined arbitration at the end of the season. Free agency (2012) During the 2011‚Äì12 off-season, Harden underwent shoulder surgery and spent the entire 2012 season on free agency without signing for a team or playing a single game. Minnesota Twins (2013) After a one year hiatus from baseball due to recovering from shoulder surgery, Harden signed a minor league contract with the Minnesota Twins on December 21, 2012. Harden was released on July 27, 2013. Pitching style Harden threw four pitches: a fastball, a changeup, a splitter, and a slider. Harden's fastball typically reached speeds of 92‚Äì96 miles per hour (mph) and on occasion broke 100 mph. Because of the grip he used, his splitter often acted much like a knuckleball because it was difficult to predict what it would do, resulting in it often being referred to as the \\"ghost pitch\\". Former Oakland Athletics catcher Adam Melhuse coined the term \\"spluckle\\" (a combination of splitter and knuckleball) to refer to this innovative pitch. Harden was well known for his ability to induce strikeouts. With the exception of his 2010 season with the Texas Rangers, he struck out over a quarter of batters he faced after 2006. His swinging strikeout rate of 13% was highest of all then-active major league starters since 2008.

The Dolly Varden trout (Salvelinus malma) is a species of salmonid native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. It is in the genus Salvelinus of true chars, which includes 51 recognized species, the most prominent being the brook, lake and bull trout, as well as Arctic char. Although many populations are semi- anadromous, fluvial and lacustrine populations occur throughout its range. It is considered by taxonomists as part of the Salvelinus alpinus or Arctic char complex, as many populations of bull trout, Dolly Varden trout and Arctic char overlap. Taxonomy The scientific name of the Dolly Varden is Salvelinus malma. The species was originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. The name malma was based on the local Russian colloquial name for the fish. The Dolly Varden trout is considered part of the S. alpinus or Arctic char complex. For most of the 19th and 20th centuries, the Dolly Varden trout (S. malma) and the bull trout (S. confluentus) were considered the same species. Additionally, the Arctic char (S. alpinus) along with the bull trout have ranges that overlap and are remarkably similar in appearance, thus complicating identification. In 1978, inland forms of the Dolly Varden trout were reclassified as Salvelinus confluentus, retaining the common name bull trout. It appears that the first recorded use of the Dolly Varden name for fish referred to S. confluentus, now commonly known as the bull trout. This was likely due to overlapping ranges and similar appearances among members of the two species. Subspecies Dolly Varden fingerling at Hokkaido Japan aquarium, probably Salvelinus malma miyabei In North America, two subspecies of Dolly Varden are distinguished, the Northern Dolly Varden (S. m. malma) of the Arctic drainages and the Southern Dolly Varden (S. m. lordi) of the Pacific drainages. These can be distinguished as separate mitochondrial lineages also. The status of the Beringian drainage populations remains unclear. Northern populations on the Russian side of the Pacific down to Kamchatka are considered S. m. malma, and the southerly populations make another lineage and subspecies, the Asian Dolly Varden (or southern Dolly Varden) S. m. krascheninnikova (= S. curilus). The landlocked Miyabe Char (S. m. miyabei Oshima, 1938) from Lake Shikaribetsu on Hokkaido in Japan is also included in the Dolly Varden species.Salvelinus malma miyabei FishBase (2014) * S. m. malma (Walbaum, 1792) (Northern Dolly Varden) * S. m. lordi (G√ºnther, 1866) (Southern Dolly Varden) * S. m. krascheninnikova (Taranez, 1933) = Salvelinus curilus (Southern Dolly Varden or Asian Dolly Varden) * S. m. miyabei (Oshima, 1938) (Miyabe Char) Origin of common name \\"Dolly Varden\\" A freshly caught fish The first recorded use of the name \\"Dolly Varden\\" was applied to members of S. confluentus caught in the McCloud River in northern California in the early 1870s. In his book, Inland Fishes of California, Peter Moyle recounts a letter sent to him on March 24, 1974, from Valerie Masson Gomez: In 1874, Livingston Stone, a naturalist working for the U.S. government, wrote of this fish: Although the name \\"Dolly Varden\\" was originally given to the bull trout of the McCloud River, bull trout (S. confluentus) and Dolly Varden trout (S. malma) were considered the same species (S. malma) until 1978. Thus the common name \\"Dolly Varden\\" gained acceptance for S. malma for over 100 years. Additionally, the Arctic char (S. alpinus) and Russian subspecies have been referred to as Dolly Varden. It is known as belyi golets in Russian. Description Dolly Varden in crystal clear river at the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve The back and sides are olive green or muddy gray, shading to white on the belly. The body has scattered pale yellow or pinkish-yellow spots. There are no black spots or wavy lines on the body or fins. Small red spots are present on the lower sides. These are frequently indistinct. The fins are plain and unmarked except for a few light spots on the base of the caudal fin rays. S. malma is extremely similar in appearance to the bull trout (S. confluentus) and Arctic char (S. alpinus), so much so that they are sometimes referred to as \\"native char\\" without a distinction. Range U.S. range map for Salvelinus malma, Dolly Varden trout The Dolly Varden trout is found in coastal waters of the North Pacific from Puget Sound north along the British Columbia Coast to the Alaska Peninsula and into the eastern Aleutian Islands, along the Bering Sea and the Arctic Sea to the Mackenzie River. The range in Asia extends south through the Kamchatka Peninsula into northern Japan. Life cycle Dolly Varden are found in three distinct forms. A semi-anadromous or sea-run form migrates from fresh water and spends some time in the ocean or saltwater bays and estuaries to feed before returning to fresh water to spawn. Fluvial forms live in moderate to large freshwater riverine environments and migrate into smaller tributaries to spawn. A third form is found in deep, cold lakes, from where they eventually migrate into tributary streams to spawn. Most populations of the northern Dolly Varden (S. m. malma) are semi-anadromous, while more fluvial and lacustrine populations are found among the southern Dolly Varden (S. m. lordi). Conservation In the early 20th century, the Dolly Varden (still including bull trout, and often confused with Arctic char) suffered from a reputation as an undesirable predator of fish such as salmon, steelhead and cutthroat trout. Despite co-evolving with these other species for thousands of years, Dolly Varden were accused of indiscriminately feeding on eggs and fry of other species to their detriment. Between 1921 and 1941, the Territory of Alaska, supported by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, had an official extermination program that paid bounties on Dolly Varden. In the Iliamna Lake/Kvichak River region in southwest Alaska, the bounty was 2.5 cents per Dolly Varden tail turned into the territorial tax collector. Locals would trap Dolly Varden in nets and weirs, string 40 tails on a hoop of bailing wire and smoke them over a wood fire. One hoop would be worth one dollar. The fish carcasses would be used for dog food. The hoops of fishtails were then used as currency to pay for supplies, or in some reports, airfare with local bush pilots. The northern Dolly Varden in the Canadian province of British Columbia and in the federal region of the Northwest Territories is listed as a species of special concern. Fishing The Dolly Varden is considered and regulated as a game fish in the U.S. and Canada. Dolly Varden make up a sizable percentage of the catch in Alaskan subsistence fisheries where salmon are not abundant. Anglers will use a variety of lures to catch dolly varden, but when fishing during salmon spawning season, salmon roe is the bait of choice. https://www.riversearch.com/site/how-to-catch-dolly- varden.html ReferencesExternal links * Alaska Dolly Varden * Conservation of Dolly Varden in Alaska (PDF) * Education on Alaska Dolly Varden trout (PDF) * South Central Alaska Wild Dolly Varden (PDF) * Southeast Alaska Steelhead and Dolly Varden Management (PDF) * Washington's Native Char * British Columbia Dolly Varden ** U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Dolly Varden trout Category:Fish of the North Pacific Category:Cold water fish Category:Freshwater fish of the Arctic Dolly Varden trout Category:Taxa named by Johann Julius Walbaum ","title":"Dolly Varden trout"},{"id":"1880493","text":"Amir Ch≈´pƒÅn (; died November 1327), also spelt Choban or Coban, was a Chupanid noble of the Ilkhanate, and nominal general of the Mongol Empire. He was ennobled by Emperor Taiding of Yuan as Duke of Yi (ÁøäÂúãÂÖ¨).  Background  Chupan's father Malek participated in Siege of Baghdad while his uncle Akrunchi participated in a campaign in Georgia in 1318. His grandfather was Tudaun from the Suldus clan and was directly descended from Chilaun, who was one of Chingis Khan's four great companions. Tudaun accompanied Hulagu on his campaign against Golden Horde in 1262 and named as governor of Diyar Bakr, died in 1277 at the Battle of Elbistan.  Early career  He participated in a battle against Nogai of Golden Horde in 1289 during his 20s. Amir Chupan was mentioned as a supporter of Gaykhatu during the latter's successful campaign for the Ilkhanid throne. During Ghazan's fight with Baydu for the throne in 1295, Chupan met with him near the Ustunavand castle and changed sides. He participated in a campaign against Sulaimish of Oirats, who rebelled in Anatolia in 1299. He acted as a senior commander during Ghazan's three campaigns against Syria, then under the rule of the Mamelukes. However later, Chupan's army under the command of Ghazan's chief military officer Qutlugh Shah, was defeated by the Mamelukes in the battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303). When Qutlugh Shah fled, Chupan stayed with the army, and reached Ghazan in June. Ghazan, furious at the defeat, punished both Qutlugh Shah and Chupan, though the latter was dealt with more leniently. He also met Zahid Gilani sometime during reign of Ghazan.  Under √ñljeit√º  On 19 March 1305 Chupan was betrothed to the daughter of Ghazan's successor √ñljeit√º, Dowlandi Khatun. In 1307 he was given command of one of four armies assigned to quell the rebellious province of Gilan. Marching from Ardabil, he convinced the rulers of Astara and Gaskar to surrender peacefully, and then met up with √ñljeit√º. Qutlugh Shah's army, however, did not fare so well, and he was killed by the Gilakis. Following his death, √ñljeit√º made Chupan his chief military commander or Amir of the Ulus (nation). This was followed by his marriage to his fiancee Dowlandi on 30 September 1307. Chupan was now a major influence behind the throne, though he had to contend with the court viziers. Dowlandi died in 1314, following death of √ñljeit√º in 1316, his son Abu Sa'id confirmed Chupan's status as Amir of the Ulus, despite attempts by the Amir Sevinch to gain the position for himself. Moreover was betrothed to Sati Beg, another daughter of √ñljeit√º in 1317. Height and fall under Abu Sa'id Chupan attempted to neutralize the influence of the viziers. In 1318, he convinced the discredited former vizier Rashid-al-Din Hamadani to return to the Ilkhanid court. Rashid, who had many enemies, was accused of poisoning √ñljeit√º soon after he returned. Chupan promptly turned on him, and Rashid-al-Din was put to death in July of that year. In 1319, armies under the command of the khan of the Blue Horde, √ñz-Beg, invaded the Ilkhanate. Abu Sa'id led a campaign to stop the invasion. Chupan was on his way to assist Amir Husain (the father of the founder of the Jalayirids, Hasan Buzurg) against the raids of the Chagatai prince Yasa'ur, who was devastating Khurasan, but then turned around to support Abu Sa'id upon receiving word that the latter's position across the Kur River was in danger. Several of Abu Sa'id's officers had deserted, leaving his army weakened. He rushed to his master's position, only to find the troops of the Blue Horde already in flight. Nevertheless, Chupan inflicted heavy casualties upon the enemy. The matter of Abu Sa'id's officers fleeing still needed to be addressed. When the amir enacted punishment against Qurumushi (also a potential rival), as well as several other officers, for their military negligence, a conspiracy was then launched against him. The conspirators included Abu Sa'id's uncle Irinjin, who Chupan had dismissed from the governorship of Diyarbakr. Irinjin was defeated near Mianeh in June 1319. Following these events, Chupan gained almost complete influence over the Ilkhan, and his sons gained prominent positions as the Ilkhanate was parceled out between them. His sons Timurtash, Shaikh Mahmud, Hasan and Demasq Kaja were given governorships of Anatolia, Georgia, Khorasan and Azerbaijan respectively. He also married Abu Sa'id's sister Sati Beg, whom he had been betrothed to since 1316. However, his son Timurtash rose in rebellion in 1322, claiming to be Mahdi. Chupan went to obtain his surrender personally and even managed to get reappointment to the post by Abu Sa'id. Abu Sa'id sometime fell in love with Baghdad Khatun, one of emir Chupan's daughters. The emir's efforts to keep Abu Sa'id from marrying his daughter, who was still married to Hasan Buzurg (another powerful kingmaker of the era), did not help the situation. Abu Said approached Chupan in 1325, claiming her unsuccessfully. Chupan sent his daughter and son-in-law to Karabakh instead while himself went against √ñzbeg and Tarmashirin who invaded Azerbaijan and Khorasan respectively. Same year Chupan defeated another force led by √ñzbeg, and even invaded the Blue Horde. As Chupan had reached the height of his power, he had also sown the seeds of his fall. While Abu Sa'id lacked a treasury, Chupan's son and administrative representative Demasq Kaja spent his wealth extravagantly. This situation annoyed the Ilkhan, who was further influenced against him by his viziers, particularly Rukn al-Din Sa'in, Chupan's own prot√©g√©. Chupan's efforts to keep Abu Sa'id from marrying his daughter Bagdad Katun, who was already married to Hasan Buzurg, did not help the situation. Early in 1326, Chupan led an army to defend against an imminent invasion of Khurasan. By the request of Abu Said, the Khagan Yes√ºn Tem√ºr awarded his custodian Chupan the nominal title of a chief-commander of all Mongol Khanates.Thomas T. Allsen-Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia, p.39 In the autumn of that year, the Chagatai Khan Tarmashirin crossed the Oxus River, and was defeated by Chupan's son Hasan near Ghazna. The vizier Rukn al-Din Sa'in had traveled with Chupan, leaving Demasq Kaja in effective control at the Ilkhanid court. It was at this time that Abu Sa'id decided to make his move. Using opportunity, on 25 August 1327, Abu Sa'id had one of Chupan's sons, Demasq Kaja, killed, apparently for his activities with a former concubine of √ñljait√º's. Hearing this, Chupan marched against Abu Sa'id seeking revenge. he convinced the local religious leader of Simnan, Shaikh 'Ala' al-Daula, to try to negotiate a truce, and then camped near Qazvin. When the shaikh failed, he continued west, with his troops pillaging on the way. Upon reaching Quha, he was a day's journey away from Abu Sa'id's camp, but as night fell, most of his army including Muhammad Beg, uncle of Abu Sa'id deserted him near Ray, taking 30.000 soldier with them, leaving Chupan no choice but to retreat to Herat. Upon reaching Saveh, he sent his wife Sati Beg back to Abu Sa'id. He then traveled in the direction of Tabas, with the intention of finding refuge in Transoxiana. Upon reaching the Murghab River, he changed his mind and headed for Khurasan. He was given a friendly welcome into Herat by the local Kartid ruler, Ghiyath ud-Din. However he was soon strangled to death under orders of Abu Sa'id in 1327. Chupan and his son Chilaun were both killed. As Chupan's friend, Ghiyath ordered that he be killed by strangulation, which was considered an honorable way to die. The Kartid leader then sent one of Chupan's fingers to Abu Sa'id as proof of the deed. Many of Chupan's sons were to also die in the next few years. His daughter soon forced to divorce Hasan Buzurg and marry Abu Sa'id. In compensation, Hasan was awarded former post of Chupan, rising to be new commander-in-chief of Ilkhanid army. He was buried in Medina, in the cemetery of Baqi, under the supervision of his daughter Bagdad Katun.  Personality  Chupan was described as a devout Muslim who was also against among emirs who opposed √ñljeit√º's conversion to Shiism. Described by various sources as brave and just, he was also known to sponsor a water canal to Mecca in 1325. Being a fervent Muslim, he also oversaw reconstruction of mosques in Tabriz as well as demolition of churches. Nevertheless, he also protected Mar Yahballaha III. Children He had at least 4 wives, by whom Chupanid dynasty descended. Most of his children were born by unknown spouses. He also named at least two of his sons after his ancestors Chilaun and Sorgan Shira: *With unknown wives: *#Hasan ‚Äî Viceroy of Khorasan and Mazandaran *#*Talish *#*Haji Beg *#*Quc Husayn *#Timurtash ‚Äî Viceroy of Anatolia *#*Hasan Kuchak *#*Malek Ashraf *#**Timurtash *#**Sultanbakht *#*Malek Ashtar *#*Misr Malek *#Demasq Kaja ‚Äî Representative of Chupan in court of Abu Sa'id, married to Tursan (or Tursin), daughter of Irinjin of Keraites *#*Dilshad Khatun *#*3 daughters *#Shaikh Mahmud ‚Äî Governor of Armenia and Georgia *#*Pir Husayn *#*3 sons *#Bagdad Katun ‚Äî Khatun of Abu Sa'id * Dowlandi Katun (betrothal - 19 March 1305, married - 30 September 1307, died - 1314) ‚Äî daughter of √ñljeit√º *# Chilaun * Kurdujin Khatun ‚Äî governess of Shiraz and Kirman, daughter of Meng√º Timur and Abish Khatun: *# Siuksah *#Yagi Basti *# Nowruz * Sati Beg ( 1316‚Äì1345) ‚Äî daughter of √ñljeit√º, later Il-Khan: *# Surgan References Sources  * *Charles Melville and 'Abbas Zaryab. http://www.iranica.com/articles/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home1/iranica/articles/v5_articles/chobanids&OptStrLogFile;=/home/iranica/public_html/logs/pdfdownload.html *J.

They are an organized crime family originating from the Sicilian village of Corleone, and who are based in New York City. The Corleone family has drawn comparisons with the real-life Genovese and Bonanno crime families.  Fictional history  The Corleone crime family traces its roots to 1920, when Vito Corleone assassinated Little Italy's padrone, Don Fanucci, and took over Fanucci's territory along with fellow criminals Genco Abbandando, Peter Clemenza and Salvatore Tessio. Shortly afterward, he founded the Genco Pura Olive Oil Company as a front for his criminal activities. Around 1925, Vito formally organized the family, with Genco as his consigliere and Clemenza and Tessio as caporegimes. They became the most powerful crime family in New York City after defeating Salvatore Maranzano during the Olive Oil War in the early 1930s. It was during this time that Vito's eldest son, Santino \\"Sonny\\" Corleone, made his reputation and eventually became a caporegime himself. Upon becoming successful, the family moved to a compound on Long Island.  Killing the Turk  In 1945, Don Vito Corleone declines drug baron Virgil \\"The Turk\\" Sollozzo's narcotics business proposal, and this nearly destroys the family. Sollozzo believed Vito's eldest son Sonny wanted to accept the deal, and he had his men gun down Don Vito outside his office. However, Vito survives and is hospitalized. Sonny takes over as acting Don of the Corleone family. After a second assassination attempt on Don Vito, Sonny has Bruno Tattaglia, son of Don Tattaglia, assassinated. The situation escalates further when Don Vito's youngest son Michael murders both Sollozzo and corrupt police officer Captain McCluskey during a meeting in the Bronx, which forces Michael to flee to Sicily. This triggers the Five Families War, during which Sonny is assassinated. After Sonny's death, the still- recuperating Don Vito makes peace with the other families, realizing that his true enemy is Emilio Barzini, who wanted to crush the Corleones to become the most powerful mafia don in New York City.  Las Vegas  After Don Vito's semi-retirement, followed by his fatal heart attack, Michael succeeds his father as the Don. Michael carries out Sonny's plan to murder the other New York City Mafia bosses along with Moe Greene, who stood in the way of the family's business interests in Las Vegas, Salvatore Tessio, who betrayed Michael for Barzini, and Carlo Rizzi, who was involved in the murder of Sonny. Following this, Michael moves the family to Lake Tahoe. Michael attempts to legitimize the Corleone business, but is pulled back into crime after a failed attempt on his life by Miami gangster and Corleone business partner, Hyman Roth, attempting to halt the takeover of Las Vegas. Roth is eventually murdered on Michael's orders. Michael's older brother, Fredo Corleone, was ensnared by Roth to conspire against the Corleones. At their mother's funeral, Michael sanctions the assassination of his surviving older brother.  Legitimization  In The Godfather Part III, by 1979, the activities of the Corleone family were nearly completely legitimate. Michael Corleone sold their interests in all casinos and hotels and invested only in businesses unconnected to Mafia activities. The underboss of the Corleone's criminal enterprise, Joey Zasa, resentful of the reforms, aligned with aging kingpin Don Altobello, and together orchestrated an assassination attempt on Michael Corleone during a meeting in Atlantic City.  Vincent Corleone  In 1980, Michael appointed his nephew and Sonny's illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini, to be his successor as Don of the Corleone family, he allowed him to change his name to Vincent Corleone. In return for this, Michael ordered him to end his relationship with Michael's daughter (and Vincent's cousin) Mary Corleone. Vincent assured him that he would. Under Michael's mentoring, Vincent is remade into a new man - wiser, patient, and aware of his status as the new Don. However, he retained a violent streak, as evidenced in his first act as Don. With Michael's tacit blessing, he ordered the deaths of Gilday, Keinszig, and Lucchesi in one mass slaughter. However, Mary was killed in a failed assassination attempt on Michael. Vincent quickly and ruthlessly killed Mosca, the assassin responsible. Despite this, Michael still dies alone and despondent after an unknown period of time.

The station features agricultural news programming during the day and classic country at night. KRVN is one of two 50,000-watt stations in Nebraska, the other being KFAB in Omaha. It is the second-most powerful station in the state; unlike KFAB, it is not a clear- channel, Class A station, but it does operate on a clear-channel frequency, on which WCBS in New York City is the dominant station. KRVN broadcasts from a four-tower antenna array located in the middle of cornfields near Holdrege, Nebraska. KRVN is Nebraska's primary entry point station for the Emergency Alert System. Due to its transmitter power and central Nebraska's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), KRVN boasts one of the largest coverage areas in the Western United States. During the day, tower #3 radiates the transmitter's full power to almost all of Nebraska's densely populated area, as well as more than half of Kansas and northeastern Colorado. At night, power is fed to all four towers to provide a directional signal aimed to the west to protect WCBS. This results in the second-largest city within its coverage area, Kearney, only getting a grade B signal; a translator at 106.9 FM is used to make up for this shortfall. Even with this arrangement, it is able to cover western Nebraska, northwestern Kansas, northeastern Colorado, and most of the Dakotas. KRVN is a member of the Nebraska Cornhuskers radio network. The KRVN network is unique in that it is owned and operated by a cooperative of farmers and ranchers, the Nebraska Rural Radio Association. It was founded in 1948, opening its first station, KRVN, in 1951. It was originally located at 1010 AM, broadcasting with 10,000 watts. In 1972, it moved to its current frequency and boosted its transmitting power to 50,000 watts; the lower dial position and stronger transmitter enabled it to serve more of central Nebraska's farmers.NRRA timeline The NRRA launched a sister music station with a similar callsign, KRVN-FM (River 93.1), in 1962.

A karategi is somewhat similar to a judogi (ÊüîÈÅìÁùÄ or ÊüîÈÅìË°£, Judo uniform) as it shares a common origin; however, the material and cut of the uniform is generally much lighter and looser fitting. The heaviest of Karategi are only compared to some judogi at . Because of the nature of Karate training which emphasizes striking, kicking and a more limited range of standing throws compared to Judo the karategi has evolved in a manner that maximizes mobility and speed without the extremely coarse and strong fabric required for grappling and throwing found in Judo. They are made from smooth cotton which may be brushed or ribbed for unrestricted movement and added comfort. Reinforced stitching is common, as to compensate for the stresses put on the gi. Inferior karategi are often cut from a light fabric similar to that of a summer shirt. These karategi are easily ripped, and tend to adhere to the practitioner's skin, creating some discomfort after any extensive perspiration is experienced. Such materials yield a karategi no heavier than the . Most quality karategi are cut from a light canvas style cloth because of its ability to stand up to considerable amounts of rigorous application and abuse without restricting the mobility of the karateka. Typically, such karategi weigh at least . The weight of the material helps Karateka determine how rigid the suit will be. or cotton canvas is standard, although some manufacturers offer materials. It is not unusual for a martial artist to feel better cooled when using a heavier karategi, compared to the cheaper karategi. Naturally, heavier suits will be more rigid. This rigidity increases ventilation within the suit. The heavier gi also has a more pronounced sound when a move is executed. Despite the extra weight of the heavier fabrics, most experienced practitioners prefer them due to their durability, and the ability of the thicker fabric to wick away perspiration. The three main cuts of karate gi are Kata, European and Japanese. The Japanese cut has short sleeves and trousers for less restriction. This cut also has a longer lapel that prevents it from riding up over the belt (obi). The Kata cut is very rare. It has even shorter sleeves and is chosen more for aesthetic appeal. European Cut has longer sleeves and trouser. The lapel is shorter. This cut again is chosen for aesthetic appeal. Karate uniforms come in a wide array of colours. Most Karateka still wear white. Some clubs use a system of differing colours to differentiate students from instructors. Karatekas hone their skills at the dojo wearing karate gi Different styles of Karate have slightly different uniforms though all share the same basic design, differing only in the lengths of sleeves, legs and the skirt of the uwagi (jacket). Many karateka tend to wear their obi (belt) much longer than judoka and other martial artists. Karategi are sometimes worn to practice other arts, such as jujutsu, when the practitioners are young and can expect to grow out of the gi in a few years; in this case, their reduced durability in comparison to judogi is less of a factor, and buying karategi until the practitioner stops growing is more cost- effective. The karate gi appears to have been developed from the Judo uniform. When Gichin Funakoshi demonstrated karate in Japan at the Kodokan, he still wore a traditional judo gi. \\"GI\\" is a recognised word in both the official scrabble dictionary and the Merriam Webster Second edition dictionary.

It originally aired on NBC over four consecutive nights (one three-hour segment and three two-hour segments) in November 1977. The Godfather Saga is also known as The Godfather: The Complete Novel for Television, The Godfather: A Novel for Television, The Godfather Novella, The Godfather: 1901-1959 - The Complete Epic, and The Godfather Epic (on HBO). The television version was the basis for a shorter, 1981 video release known as The Godfather 1902‚Äì1959: The Complete Epic. Following the release of The Godfather Part III in 1990, a third unified version was released to video in 1992 entitled The Godfather Trilogy: 1901‚Äì1980.  Film structure  Francis Ford Coppola asked his editor Barry Malkin to make a seven-hour version for television; Coppola reportedly did this project to raise money for Apocalypse Now, which was severely over-budget at the time. The resulting film was in chronological order. The Godfather Part II had cut back and forth between scenes in the early 1900s and the late 1950s, and was therefore both a prequel and a sequel to The Godfather. Malkin also toned down the violence, sex, and language for a television audience. The television film incorporated additional footage not included in the original films, including Don Fanucci being attacked by street thugs, Vito Corleone's first encounter with Hyman Roth, Vito killing two of the mafiosi who worked for Don Ciccio and were instrumental in his family's death, Michael Corleone's reunion with his father after his return from Sicily, Sonny Corleone's taking charge of the family after his father is severely wounded, and Michael's vengeance upon Fabrizio for killing Apollonia. The previously deleted scenes totaled almost 75 minutes. Hal Erickson summarized the results as follows, \\"While this rearrangement was reasonably coherent, the rhythm and pacing of the original theatrical versions of the two films was severely damaged. The inclusion of scenes previously removed from the theatrical prints also stretched out what was already an overlong project. Even allowing for the achievement of pulling off this gargantuan editing assignment, The Godfather Saga is a lumpy affair which seems to stop and start at irregular intervals and never truly picks up momentum.\\"  Nielsen ratings  According to the entry in Les Brown's Encyclopedia of Television, the Nielsen ratings for the special were supposedly not as high as expected, possibly because both films had already aired (albeit separately) on NBC in previous years.  Re-release  On March 3, 2012, the American cable television channel AMC marked the 40th anniversary of the original theatrical release of The Godfather by re- broadcasting The Godfather Saga. It marked the first time the Saga was broadcast in high definition. This showing also reinstated the violence that had previously been removed for its original broadcast.  The Godfather 1902‚Äì1959: The Complete Epic  The Godfather 1902‚Äì1959: The Complete Epic is a reduced, 386 minute version of The Godfather Saga (434 minutes) that was released to video in 1981. Reports a runtime of 386 minutes. Copies of the credits and other materials that accompanied the video release. Unlike the Saga, which presented in four segments (each with opening and closing credits), the Epic is presented as a single segment. Lucia Bozzola wrote of this version, \\"With the freedom of home video, The Complete Epic reinstated the violence that had been edited for television; free of commercial breaks, the narrative drive of Part I was mostly restored, but the impact of Part II was still muted by the separation of Vito's rise from Michael's descent.\\" In January 2016, HBO aired the epic in its uncut and uncensored format; later making it available on its streaming platforms. The HBO showing contained most of the known deleted scenes, thereby lengthening the runtime of the Epic from its video release. This HBO version carries the title Mario Puzo's The Godfather: The Complete Epic 1901-1959 which has a runtime of 423 minutes.  The Godfather Trilogy: 1901‚Äì1980  Following the release of The Godfather Part III in 1990, Coppola, Barry Malkin, and Walter Murch edited the three Godfather movies into chronological order to make the film The Godfather Trilogy: 1901‚Äì1980. As had the earlier compilations, this film incorporated scenes that are not part of the theatrical releases. This webpage reproduces material originally distributed with the \\"home video\\" release. It was released on VHS and laserdisc in 1992; it has not been released on DVD, and is now rare. The total run time for this version is 583 minutes (9 hours, 43 minutes). There were reviews of this version of the film that were favorable. A Time review reads, \\"This trilogy has a novelistic density, a rueful, unhurried lyricism and a depth that, singly, the films could not achieve. Altogether glorious.\\"  Additional scenes  Several additional scenes not shown in theaters were added to the Saga, Epic, and Trilogy.  The Godfather additional scenes  *After Vito agrees to help Amerigo Bonasera avenge the beating of his daughter, Vito whistles to Sonny and asks if he was paying attention. Sonny confirms that he was.

Life and work  He was born Jacob Morris Strelitsky in Baku (Azerbaijan) to an eastern European Jewish family. When he was a child, his family left the Russian Empire and moved to the United States, settling in New York City. At a young age he took the name John Malcolm Stahl and began working, first as a theatre actor and then in the city's growing motion picture industry. He directed his first silent film short in 1913. In 1919 he signed on with Louis B. Mayer Pictures in Hollywood. In 1924 he was part of the Mayer team that founded MGM Studios. In 1927, Stahl was one of the thirty-six founding members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. With the industry's transition to talkies and feature-length films, Stahl successfully made the adjustment. From 1927 through 1929 Stahl was an executive at the short-lived independent studio Tiffany Pictures, and renamed the company \\"Tiffany-Stahl Productions\\". In 1930 he joined Universal Pictures where he directed in 1934 the film Imitation of Life, which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture. The following year, he directed Magnificent Obsession, starring Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor. Both films were later remade in the 1950s by director Douglas Sirk. John Stahl continued to produce and direct major productions as well as filler shorts up to the time of his death. Some of his other notable directorial work was for The Keys of the Kingdom in 1944 and the 1945 film noir, Leave Her to Heaven starring Gene Tierney, who was nominated for Best Actress. Stahl died in Hollywood in 1950. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. He was married to actress and writer Frances Irene Reels from 1918 to her death in 1926, and to actress Roxana McGowan from 1931 to his death. On February 8, 1960, for his contributions to the motion pictures industry, Stahl received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6546 Hollywood Boulevard.

Early life and education  He was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, but grew up on a ranch. He left school at a young age to work, but returned later in life to get his high school diploma. He eventually became a local businessman in the BC interior and also worked as a mining consultant and prospector.  Political life  He was first elected as a Reform Party MP in the 1993 election. He became recognized for the large cowboy hat he normally wore and for his outspoken conservatism. In his first term, he was often the centre of controversy. He was criticized for suggesting the best way to prevent spousal abuse was to give women handguns. After opposition MP John Cannis heckled him as a racist in the House of Commons, he replied \\"Do you have the fortitude or the gonads to stand up and come across here and say that to me, you son of a bitch?\\" Eventually the Speaker chided both men for unparliamentary language. Later that same year, after Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest called him a bigot in a heated exchange, Stinson replied that Charest was a \\"fat little, chubby, little sucker.\\" In 1999, he was accused of challenging Liberal MP Steve Mahoney to fight. He was one of a handful of Reform MPs to oppose the idea of a United Alternative, being unwilling to sacrifice Reform principles to facilitate a merger with the PC Party. He eventually agreed to the creation of the Canadian Alliance (CA) with elements of the PC Party, and became a member of that party when it was created. He backed Stockwell Day in the 2000 CA leadership election, and was given a number of critics positions when Day became leader. Stinson was much angered by the Liberal victory in the 2000 election and attended the inaugural convention of the Alberta Independence Party along with fellow CA MP Myron Thompson. This flirtation with Alberta separatism sparked controversy, and Stinson was moved by Day to the backbenches. Stinson and Thompson were soon after at the centre of another controversy when it emerged they had convinced Day to hire a private investigator to investigate Liberals. Stinson remained one of Day's strongest supporters, firmly against the Alliance members who tried to oust him. Stinson was reportedly one of the MPs most firmly opposed to allowing the dissident MPs back into the party after Day resigned. He continued his opposition to any merger with the Tories, and in 2003 was the only Canadian Alliance MP to vote against Stephen Harper's merger plan in a caucus meeting, but he later came to support the new party.  Recent times  Since 2004, he has been battling bladder cancer, and his frequent absences from parliament played an important role in the finely-balanced minority government. In the crucial May 19, 2005, vote on the Canadian budget, the 152‚Äì152 tie was broken by the Speaker voting in favour, ensuring the continuity of the government. As Stinson was undergoing surgery at the time, a Liberal MP agreed to sit out the vote as a courtesy. Due to his illness he retired from parliament following the fall of the Paul Martin government on November 28, 2005.

Life  Not much is known on Arpa's earlier life, except that he was a member of the house of Tolui. His lineage traced back to Ariq B√∂ke, who was the youngest brother of M√∂ngke, Kublai and Hulagu.His grandfather Mingqan Ke'un was a son of Malik Tem√ºr and Emegen Khatun and arrived in Iran during reign of √ñljait√º in summer of 1306.  Reign  He was nominated to the throne by Abu Sa'id's vizier Ghiyas al-Din and was elected 5 days later with regnal title Sultan Muiz al-Dunya wa'l Din Mahmud on Karabakh. Instead of a golden crown, he had a felt and simple waistband as regaila. Almost immediately he had to deal with an invasion by √ñzbeg of the Golden Horde. He defeated the invasion, and furthermore used it as a pretext for executing Abu Sa'id's widow Bagdad Katun, accusing her of poisoning Abu Sa'id and allying with √ñzbeg He afterwards married Sati Beg, Abu Sa'id's sister and widow of Chupan in order to legitimize his rule. Another execution was of Mahmudshah Inju, former ruler of Fars province in March 1336 (he was imprisoned by Abu Sa'id earlier because of his attempt on ilkhan's life). He also gave Shaykh Hasan the overall command of armies. He was characterized as not a practicing Muslim and more in favor of Genghis Khan's Yasa, mostly ignoring laws of Muslim khans like Ghazan and Abu Sa'id. His rule was not accepted by a part of Oirats, whose leader and the governor of Baghdad - Ali Padshah was an uncle of Abu Sa'id and had his own designs on throne. Claiming Abu Sa'id's wife Dilshad Khatun was still pregnant, he raised Musa, the grandson of Baydu as rightful heir to the throne. Oirat traditional rivalry with Ariq B√∂ke's line could also be a factor in this rebellion. After securing Shaykh Hasan's neutrality, Ali Padshah went on to battle Arpa on Jaghatu plains near Maraga on 29 April 1336. Arpa's army were led by 60 emirs, notably Hajji Taghay (son of Sutay, Governor of Diyar Bakr), Uyghur commander √ñgr√ºnch, Torut (a son of Nari and relative of Narin Taghay), Ortuq-Shah (son of Alghu) and Chupan's son Sorgan Sira. However, soon some emirs defected to the side of Ali Padshah, such as Mahmud b. Essen Qutlugh and Sultanshah Nikruz. Battle was a defeat for Arpa and soon after he was captured in Sultaniya and killed on 15 May 1336 by Mahmudshah's son, Amir Jalal al-Din Mas'ud Shah.

American publisher Bennett Cerf remarked at that year's meeting of the American Booksellers Association that there had been \\"only three novels published since the first of the year that were worth reading‚Ä¶ Cry, The Beloved Country, The Ides of March, and The Naked and the Dead.\\"\\"Reader's Digest: Gossip, news: J. F. Albright reports on A.B.A. meeting,\\" The Dallas Morning News, 30 May 1948, p. 6. Two cinema adaptations of the book have been made, the first in 1951 and the second in 1995. The novel was also adapted as a musical called Lost in the Stars (1949), with a book by the American writer Maxwell Anderson and music composed by the German emigre Kurt Weill. Plot summary During apartheid in South Africa, the separation of Blacks and Whites grew out of White racism. In the remote village of Ndotsheni, in the Natal province of eastern South Africa, the Reverend Stephen Kumalo receives a letter from a fellow minister summoning him to Johannesburg. He is needed there, the letter says, to help his sister, Gertrude, who the letter says has fallen ill. Kumalo undertakes the difficult and expensive journey to the city in the hopes of aiding Gertrude and of finding his son, Absalom, who traveled to Johannesburg from Ndotsheni and never returned. In Johannesburg, Kumalo is warmly welcomed by Msimangu, the priest who sent him the letter, and given comfortable lodging by Mrs. Lithebe, a Christian woman who feels that helping others is her duty. Kumalo visits Gertrude, who is now a prostitute and liquor seller, and persuades her to come back to Ndotsheni with her young son. A more difficult quest follows, when Kumalo and Msimangu begin searching the labyrinthine metropolis of Johannesburg for Absalom. They visit Kumalo's brother, John, who has become a successful businessman and politician, and he directs them to the factory where his son and Absalom once worked together. One clue leads to another, and as Kumalo travels from place to place, he begins to see the gaping racial and economic divisions that are threatening to split his country. Eventually, Kumalo discovers that his son has spent time in a reformatory and that he has gotten a girl pregnant. Meanwhile, the newspapers announce that Arthur Jarvis, a prominent white crusader for racial justice, has been murdered in his home by a gang of burglars. Kumalo and Msimangu learn that the police are looking for Absalom, and Kumalo's worst suspicions are confirmed when Absalom is arrested for the murder. Absalom confesses to the crime but states that two others, including John's son, Matthew, aided him and that he did not intend to murder Jarvis. With the help of friends, Kumalo obtains a lawyer for Absalom and attempts to understand what his son has become. John, however, makes arrangements for his own son's defense, even though this split will worsen Absalom‚Äôs case. When Kumalo tells Absalom's pregnant girlfriend what has happened, she is saddened by the news, but she joyfully agrees to his proposal that she marry his son and return to Ndotsheni as Kumalo's daughter-in-law. Meanwhile, in the hills above Ndotsheni, Arthur Jarvis' father, James Jarvis, tends his bountiful land and hopes for rain. The local police bring him news of his son's death, and he leaves immediately for Johannesburg with his wife. In an attempt to come to terms with what has happened, Jarvis reads his son's articles and speeches on social inequality and begins a radical reconsideration of his own prejudices. He and Kumalo meet for the first time by accident, and after Kumalo has recovered from his shock, he expresses sadness and regret for Jarvis' loss. Both men attend Absalom‚Äôs trial, a fairly straightforward process that ends with the death penalty for Absalom and an acquittal for the two other defendants. Kumalo arranges for Absalom to marry the girl who bears his child, and they bid farewell. The morning of his departure, Kumalo rouses his new family to bring them back to Ndotsheni, only to find that Gertrude has disappeared. Kumalo is now deeply aware of how his people have lost the tribal structure that once held them together and returns to his village troubled by the situation. It turns out that James Jarvis has been having similar thoughts. Arthur Jarvis' young son befriends Kumalo. As the young boy and the old man become acquainted, James Jarvis becomes increasingly involved with helping the struggling village. He donates milk at first, and then makes plans for a dam and hires an agricultural expert to demonstrate newer, less devastating farming techniques. When Jarvis‚Äô wife dies, Kumalo and his congregation send a wreath to express their sympathy. Just as the bishop is on the verge of transferring Kumalo, Jarvis sends a note of thanks for the wreath and offers to build the congregation a new church, and Kumalo is permitted to stay in his parish. On the evening before his son's execution, Kumalo goes into the mountains to await the appointed time in solitude. On the way, he encounters Jarvis, and the two men speak of the village, of lost sons, and of Jarvis' bright young grandson, whose innocence and honesty have impressed both men. When Kumalo is alone, he weeps for his son‚Äôs death and clasps his hands in prayer as dawn breaks over the valley. Characters *Stephen Kumalo: A 60-year-old Zulu priest, the father of Absalom, who attempts to find his family in Johannesburg, and later to reconstruct the disintegrating state of his village. Book three focuses heavily on his relationship with James Jarvis. *Theophilus Msimangu: A priest from Johannesburg who helps Kumalo find his son Absalom and his sister Gertrude. *John Kumalo: Stephen's brother, who denies the tribal validity and becomes a spokesman for the new racial movement in the city; a former carpenter. *Absalom Kumalo: Stephen's son who left home to look for Stephen's sister Gertrude, and who murders Arthur Jarvis. *Gertrude Kumalo: The young sister of Stephen who becomes a prostitute in Johannesburg and leads a dissolute life. *James Jarvis: A wealthy landowner whose son, Arthur, is murdered. He comes to the realization of the guilt of white residents in such crimes and forgives the Kumalos. *Arthur Jarvis: Murdered by Absalom Kumalo, he is the son of James Jarvis. He had many liberal racial views that are highly significant and influential. *Dubula: A big man who was the \\"heart\\" of anything and everything Arthur Jarvis did, including wanting peace between the races. *Mr. Carmichael: Absalom's lawyer; he takes his case pro deo (for God) in this case meaning for free. *Father Vincent: A priest from England who helps Stephen in his troubles. *Mrs. Lithebe: A native housewife in whose house Stephen stays while in Johannesburg. *The Harrisons: A father and son who represent two opposing views concerning the racial problem. The father, who is Arthur's father-in-law, represents the traditional view, while the son represents the more liberal view. *The Girl [Absalom's wife]: A teenage girl, approximately 16 years old, impregnated by Absalom, whom she later marries. She tells Kumalo that Absalom will be her third husband and that her father had abandoned her family when she was quite young. Given her young age it is unclear if any of these marriages were wholly consensual. Main themes Cry, the Beloved Country is a social protest against the structures of the society that would later give rise to apartheid. Paton attempts to create an unbiased and objective view of the dichotomies it entails: he depicts whites as affected by \\"native crime\\" while blacks suffer from social instability and moral issues due to the breakdown of the tribal system. It shows many of the problems with South Africa such as the degrading of the land reserved for the natives, which is sometimes considered to be the main theme, the disintegration of the tribal community, native crime, and the flight to urban areas. Another prevalent theme in Cry, the Beloved Country is the detrimental effects of fear on the characters and society of South Africa as indicated in the following quotation from the narrator in Chapter 12: Paton makes frequent use of literary and linguistic devices such as microcosms, intercalary chapters and dashes instead of quotation marks for dialogue to indicate the start of speech. Allusions/references to other works The novel is filled with Biblical references and allusions. The most evident are the names Paton gives to the characters. Absalom, the son of Stephen Kumalo, is named for the son of King David, who rose against his father in rebellion. Also, in the New Testament Book of Acts, Stephen was a martyr who underwent death by stoning rather than stop declaring the things he believed. The Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts are written to Theophilus, which is Greek for \\"friend of God\\". In the novel, Absalom requests that his son be named Peter, the name of one of Jesus's disciples. Among Peter's better-known traits is a certain impulsiveness; also, after Christ's arrest, he denied knowing Jesus three times, and later wept in grief over this. After the resurrection, Peter renewed his commitment to Christ and to spreading the Gospel. All that suggests Absalom's final repentance and his commitment to the faith of his father. In another allusion, Arthur Jarvis is described as having a large collection of books on Abraham Lincoln, and the writings of Lincoln are featured several times in the novel. Paton describes Arthur's son as having characteristics similar to his when he was a child, which may allude to the resurrection of Christ. Film, television and theatrical adaptations In 1951, the novel was adapted into a motion picture of the same name, directed by Zoltan Korda. Paton wrote the screenplay with John Howard Lawson, who was left out of the original credits because he was blacklisted in Hollywood for refusing to give information to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). Kumalo was played by Canada Lee, Jarvis by Charles Carson, and Msimangu by Sidney Poitier. In 1983, a historic stage adaptation was performed by the Capital Players theatre group at the Moth Hall in Gaborone, Botswana. The country was at that time one of the leading \\"frontline states\\" to apartheid South Africa and a centre for artistic activity that often stood in quiet opposition to the racist regime just across the border. The premiere was attended by Paton himself, who had travelled from Natal, as well as Botswana's then-President Quett Masire (with political acumen, the director had arranged for the first performance to take place on the President's birthday). School students from across the country were bussed to the capital to see the production.Cited by former President Masire in a foreword to \\"More Sherlock Holmes than James Herriot\\", a memoir by the director of the Gaborone production, veterinarian Roger Windsor, published in 2015 by the Book Guild Another film version was released in 1995, directed by Darrell Roodt. James Earl Jones played the Reverend Kumalo and Richard Harris filled the role of Jarvis. A stage version by the South African playwright Roy Sargeant was developed in early 2003; it was first staged at the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, Eastern Cape on 27 June 2003 and at the Artscape Theatre in Cape Town on 8 July 2003. The director was Heinrich Reisenhofer. The script, together with notes and activities for school use, was published in 2006 by Oxford University Press Southern Africa. Musical adaptation In 1949, the composer Kurt Weill, in collaboration with the American writer Maxwell Anderson (book and lyrics), composed a musical based on the book called Lost in the Stars. The original Broadway production opened on 30 October 1949 at the Music Box Theatre and starred Todd Duncan and Inez Matthews. It ran for 273 performances before closing on 1 July 1950. It was made into a movie, starring Brock Peters and Melba Moore, released in 1974. Lost in the Stars is the last work Weill completed before his death in 1950. Although he was influenced by spirituals, jazz and blues, Weill's distinctive and original style shines throughout the score. Israeli contratenor David D'Or performed in a stage version at the Israeli National Theater (\\"Habima Theater\\") in 2004.

It is named because the rebelling officers primarily used tanks. It was successfully put down by loyal Constitutionalist soldiers led by Army Commander-in-Chief Carlos Prats. Background By the beginning of June 1973, an important part of the high command of the Chilean Armed Forces had lost all respect for the Popular Unity government of President Salvador Allende, which had been in office since November 1970. During the so-called Tacnazo of 1969, high-ranking officers had learned that by exerting pressure as a group, they could achieve wide-ranging changes within the military. In 1969 they had achieved high command changes and an increase in the Armed Forces' budget. In June 1973, some began plotting against the Allende government. A week before the coup attempt, the conspiracy was discovered at the Santiago Army garrison. The garrison commander, General Mario Sep√∫lveda Squella, informed his immediate superiors at the Army General Staff, and also told Jos√© Toh√°, the Minister of Defense. The government immediately arrested nine people involved in the conspiracy, and Minister Toh√° decided to go public with this information on the afternoon of 28 June.Mart√≠nez Torre, Ewin. \\"Second Coup Attempt: El Tanquetazo (The Tank Attack)\\", in History of Chile Under Salvador Allende and the Popular Unity, New York (2000) Putsch Early in the morning of the following day, Lieutenant Colonel Roberto Souper, who had just learned that he would be relieved of his command for his part in the conspiracy, led a column of sixteen armored vehicles, including six Sherman tanks, plus 80 soldiers from the Second Armored Battalion in Santiago. The rebel column rapidly traveled to downtown Santiago and encircled the presidential palace, La Moneda, and the building housing the Ministry of Defense, just across the Plaza de la Libertad. At two minutes before 9:00 AM, the tanks opened fire on these buildings. At the Ministry, a tank made its way to the main entrance, climbed the steps into the building, and started firing on offices. Sergeant Rafael Veillena, of the Army's Second Division, was killed when he looked out a ninth-floor window. The firing of machine guns and tanks panicked workers in the area, who at that hour were making their way to their jobs downtown. A woman working at the State Bank near the Ministry was killed, as well as a couple who were caught in cross-fire. At least 16 people were wounded, four seriously. A group of foreign journalists covering the reforms carried out by Allende's government was caught in the middle of the insurrection. While filming the events outside La Moneda, Argentine cameraman Leonardo Henrichsen and his colleague Jan Sandquist were fired at by corporal H√©ctor Hern√°n Bustamante G√≥mez and several soldiers. Henrichsen was fatally shot by a soldier, who was never identified. Before collapsing in the arms of Sandquist, Henrichsen recorded the military foot patrol firing at him. The footage was recovered by Sandquist and showed on the Argentine television on 24 July.\\"Un asesino que ahora tiene nombre y apellido\\" (An assassin who today had a number and name), Pagina 12, 7 November 2005 General Mario Sep√∫lveda Squella immediately called General Guillermo Pickering, commander of the military institutes, requesting loyal troops to suppress the rebellion. After securing these troops, he called Army Commander-in-chief General Carlos Prats with a plan to neutralize Souper's forces. General Prats approved it immediately, and a few minutes later General Sep√∫lveda Squella started to position his own troops. Earlier that morning, Salvador Allende spoke to the people of Chile from the presidential residence at Tomas Moro in Santiago. In a 9:30 AM radio address, the president announced his unequivocal decision to defend the constitutional government against an attempted coup d'√©tat. He called upon the workers of Santiago to occupy the factories \\"and be ready in case it is necessary to fight alongside the soldiers of Chile.\\" In the meantime, General Prats visited all the nearby military regiments around Santiago to secure their support against the coup. The General encountered some resistance from the officers at the Junior Officers' Academy, who claimed that they did not want to fire against fellow soldiers. Prats insisted that the insurrection against the constitutional government had to be put down, and as Army Commander-in-chief, he ordered them to the streets. After a brief moment of indecision, they chose to support him, and soon after 10:30 AM, combat-ready units from the Academy joined the fight against the rebels. Driving toward La Moneda, General Prats thought about the likely effects of these actions on other military units, who might be participating or, at least, waiting to act until they had seen the initial results. Prats decided to use all the resources available to crush the rebellion before noon. Near the presidential palace, General Prats left his car carrying a Thompson submachine gun. A large number of people had already congregated nearby, watching the movement of troops. Colonel Julio Canessa arrived with forces from the Junior Officers' Academy, and General Prats ordered pieces of heavy artillery be deployed along the principal Avenue. He took what he subsequently called \\"a calculated risk\\" by speaking directly to the mutinous soldiers in an effort to convince them to give up their fight. Prats sought to prevent a long confrontation and unnecessary military and civilian casualties. According to his later account: \\"I then decided to advance in the company of Lieutenant Colonel Osvaldo Hern√°ndez, Captain Roger Vergara, and First Sergeant Omar Vergara. Extremely moved, Villaroel, the Military Chaplain, gave us the last absolution.\\" At 11:10 AM, the four soldiers walked along Alameda Avenue carrying assault weapons. When they reached the palace, they were within steps of Tank E-2814. The commander of the tank trained his machine gun on the group but did not fire. Prats ordered him to come down, identify himself, obey his orders, and surrender to the soldiers of the Junior Officers' School. According to the account of a journalist watching the events nearby, \\"the soldier came down, stood at attention before the general, and saluted. That tank would not again fire against the Ministry of Defense or La Moneda on that morning.\\" Prats successively repeated these orders to the men in other tanks and combat vehicles located south of the Palace. When a soldier shouted from a tank: \\"I will not surrender, General!\\", while pointing his machine gun at Prats's group, Major Osvaldo Zabala approached him from behind and put a gun to his temple, disarming him and bringing the tense standoff to an end. A few of the tanks fled rather than surrendering after reinforcements from the \\"Buin\\" First Infantry Regiment arrived at the scene. This military unit, led by General Augusto Pinochet, quickly deployed its cannons and machine guns. The last rebelling unit to flee was a group of tanks and military vehicles stationed north of La Moneda. As this convoy fled south, General Prats saw Lt. Colonel Roberto Souper, \\"who looked disoriented and lost.\\" Immediately General Prats entered the palace and ordered a general search of the buildings nearby. General Pickering had cleared the rebels out of the western sector near the presidential palace. By 11:30 AM, the shooting around La Moneda had subsided, and the coup attempt appeared to be over. Aftermath Souper surrendered later that day, after units from the \\"Tacna\\" regiment encircled and fired on the Second Battalion's barracks where he and his troops had taken refuge. Other military officers involved in planning the putsch were Ren√© L√≥pez, Edwin Ditmer, H√©ctor Bustamante, Mario Garay, Carlos Mart√≠nez, Ra√∫l Jofre, and Jos√© Gasset. It was soon discovered that the main leaders of the extreme right-wing group, Fatherland and Liberty, had been the instigators. , John Schaeffer, Benjam√≠n Matte, Manuel Fuentes, and Juan Hurtado sought asylum in the Embassy of Ecuador. From there they released a communique acknowledging that they had promoted the attempted coup. During the evening, President Allende addressed a massive demonstration of support in front of La Moneda. As he neared the end of his speech, he said: \\"... trust your government. Go home and kiss your wives and children in the name of Chile.\\" Though the tanquetazo was unsuccessful, it was a turning point in the deteriorating political situation of Chile. The failure allowed the conspirators to check loyalties, and push the government to take steps towards an alliance with the Christian Democracy party.Drago, Tito (1993). Chile: un doble secuestro. Editorial Complutense, pp. 124-125. Christian Democracy's leader Patricio Aylwin demanded the formation of a coalition cabinet, to include members of the armed forces.

Thailand (Siam) After Japan's defeat in 1945, with the help of Seri Thai, Thailand was treated as a defeated country by the British and French, although American support mitigated the Allied terms. Thailand was not occupied by the Allies, but it was forced to return the territory it had regained to the British and the French. In the postwar period Thailand had relations with the United States, which it saw as a protector from the communist revolutions in neighbouring countries.http://www.endofempire.asia/0827-the-lost-territories-franco-thai- relations-after-wwii-3/ Occupation of Japan At the end of World War II, Japan was occupied by the Allies, led by the United States with contributions also from Australia, India, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. This foreign presence marked the first time in its history that the island nation had been occupied by a foreign power. The San Francisco Peace Treaty, signed on September 8, 1951, marked the end of the Allied occupation, and after it came into force on April 28, 1952, Japan was once again an independent country. International Military Tribunal for the Far East During the occupation, leading Japanese war crime charges were reserved for those who participated in a joint conspiracy to start and wage war, termed \\"Class A\\" (crimes against peace), and were brought against those in the highest decision-making bodies; \\"Class B\\" crimes were reserved for those who committed \\"conventional\\" atrocities or crimes against humanity; \\"Class C\\" crimes were reserved for those in \\"the planning, ordering, authorization, or failure to prevent such transgressions at higher levels in the command structure.\\" Twenty-eight Japanese military and political leaders were charged with Class A crimes, and more than 5,700 Japanese nationals were charged with Class B and C crimes, mostly entailing prisoner abuse. China held 13 tribunals of its own, resulting in 504 convictions and 149 executions. The Japanese Emperor Hirohito and all members of the imperial family such as Prince Asaka, were not prosecuted for involvement in any the three categories of crimes. Herbert Bix explains that \\"the Truman administration and General MacArthur both believed the occupation reforms would be implemented smoothly if they used Hirohito to legitimise their changes.\\" As many as 50 suspects, such as Nobusuke Kishi, who later became Prime Minister, and Yoshisuke Aikawa, head of the zaibatsu Nissan Group, and future leader of the Chuseiren (a body representing small and medium-sized Japanese companies) were charged but released without ever being brought to trial in 1947 and 1948. Shiro Ishii received immunity in exchange for data gathered from his experiments on live prisoners. The lone dissenting judge to exonerate all indictees was Indian jurist Radhabinod Pal. The tribunal was adjourned on 12 November 1948.

Located in California's most diverse city, OUSD serves a diverse population of students. Nearly half of the students in district and charter schools speak a non-English language at home. For the school year 2016‚Äì2017, 31 percent of OUSD students are English language learners. OUSD also serves a large population of newcomer students. Seventy-three percent of students receive free or reduced-price meals. OUSD was among the first school districts in the country to implement restorative justice practices to limit or eliminate suspensions. During the 2015 school year, 96.1 percent of students were not suspended. Started in 2010, OUSD's African American Male Achievement Initiative enrolls more than 400 students. Students in the program have experienced success, including higher GPAs, higher graduation rates (up over 10 percent), and lower suspension rates (with a decrease of ‚Öì for students enrolled in the program). In 2016, OUSD launched an African American Girls and Young Women Achievement Program to give students a place where they can find equitable support and new pathways to success. In 2015 and 2016, OUSD forged partnerships with and secured grants from a number of technology companies, including Salesforce, Intel, Code.org, and Google, and set a goal to make computer science a graduation requirement for the freshman class that begins school in 2017. History The first school in Oakland opened in the 1850s and was located in a rented room in the back of a fandango at Second and Washington Streets. On July 12, 1853, the city held a parade to the first official school building. The schoolhouse was at the corner of Fifth and Clay and cost $1,000 to construct. The first school house had 16 students and was taught by a woman named Hannah Jayne. She was the only teacher in Oakland until 1855. Franklin Warner was hired soon after as Oakland's first principal. Frederick M. Campbell was hired as Oakland's first Superintendent. Reading, writing and arithmetic were stressed, as well as American history. Paper and books were scarce, so a lot of learning was done out loud. In 1860, there were about 400 students in one-room schoolhouses taught by one teacher, and another school building at Fifth and Broadway taught older students. The first public high school opened in 1869 with 29 students. By the end of the 1870s, there was a public high school and nine public grade schools. In the 1880s, the first kindergarten and the first night school in Oakland opened. A 1909 Chamber of Commerce guide to the city includes this description of Oakland public schools: \\"Oakland's chief pride is its public school system and the fact that her schools rank among the highest in the United States. No more modern school buildings can be found in any city in the United States than in Oakland. There are twenty-two public school buildings, and according to the figures of the City Assessor (which, upon municipal property are naturally low) the school land valuations amount to One Million, Ninety-three Thousand, Two Hundred Seventy-five Dollars ‚Ä¶ Connected with the High School is a completely equipped observatory, in which the study of astronomy is made effective and interesting with the aid of the most modern instruments.\\" A City of Oakland Chamber of Commerce brochure from 1915, which includes a photo of Oakland Technical High School, states: \\"The pride of Oakland is its schools. This, the Technical High School, with forges, machine shops, a great auditorium seating 1600 people, chemical laboratories and many other education features which prepare young men and women for an active and useful life, is one of the finest structures of its kind in the United States.\\" A 1915 Board of Education guide to Oakland schools included 46 schools, many of which are still open today. They include Allendale, Claremont, Cleveland, Dewey, Elmhurst, Emerson, Franklin, Frick, Fruitvale, Lincoln, Manzanita, McClymonds, Melrose, Peralta, Piedmont, Prescott, Sequoia, Santa Fe, Fremont High, Oakland High, and Oakland Tech. High school departments included English, History, Foreign Languages, Mathematics, Science, Commercial, Home Economics, Physical Training, Shop and Drawing. Oakland's first teachers' union, the Oakland Federation of Teachers, was first organized on May 3, 1943 as the Alameda County Federation of Teachers, Local 771 of the American Federation of Teachers (AFT) to \\"improve the educational facilities for the children of the nation and to improve the working conditions of the teachers in the public schools.\\" Oakland's first African American Superintendent was Dr. Marcus Foster, who was also the first black man to head a major U.S. school district. Born in Athens, GA, Dr. Foster arrived in Oakland in 1970, ‚Äúalready a celebrated and proven educator‚Äù. Dr. Foster viewed the three Rs and critical thinking as the building blocks of education. He also emphasized the need for art programs, team sports, and school activities that reflected the life circumstances of the students. In the short time he was in Oakland, Dr. Foster created a climate that gave life to a number of firsts: the Arts Magnet School, Far West School, Street Academy, Montera Film Festival (now the National Educational Film Festival), and the Oakland Education Institute (now the Marcus Foster Education Institute). Dr. Foster was murdered by the Symbionese Liberation Army in November, 1973. In 2003, OUSD Superintendent Dennis K. Chaconas was fired and Governor Gray Davis approved a $100 million emergency loan, the biggest school bailout in California history. Chaconas was replaced by a state-appointed administrator, Randolph E. Ward. Ward resigned in July 2006 after being appointed superintendent of the San Diego public school system. Kimberly Statham was named Ward's permanent replacement, but she resigned suddenly on September 17, 2007, ostensibly under pressure from state officials. OUSD Chief of Staff Vincent Matthews was named interim superintendent. In 2008, the state turned control over OUSD back to the city. The local school board hired an interim superintendent, Roberta Mayor, in July 2008 while the school board undertook a year-long search for a permanent leader. Anthony \\"Tony\\" Smith was hired in July 2009 as the district's permanent superintendent. Smith resigned suddenly in April 2013 after four years leading the district, citing family health issues. School board member Dr. Gary Yee was named the acting superintendent. In September 2014, Antwan Wilson became OUSD's fourth superintendent in six years. After just two years at the helm, Wilson resigned in November 2016 to become chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools.; Devin Dillon, OUSD's deputy superintendent of Academic Social Emotional Learning, was named acting superintendent, effective February 1, 2017. The school board selected Kyla Johnson-Trammell to replace Wilson as superintendent in July 2017. Johnson-Trammell grew up in East Oakland, attended Oakland public elementary and middle schools, and had served the district as a teacher, principal, and administrator. Grand Jury reports Oakland Unified School District has experienced ongoing financial difficulties in recent years. A 2018 Alameda County Civil Grand Jury report noted that the District had been \\"in financial peril\\" for the prior 15 years, with an average $20 million to $30 million in debt each year, due to budgetary errors and out- of-control spending. Enrollment had dropped from 54,000 to 37,000 students, resulting in decreased state funding, but the district had opened more schools (Rudsdale Newcomer School, which serves immigrants, and the School of Language, a bilingual middle school), rather than closing them in response to declining enrollment, the report found. The report also criticized \\"system- wide failures\\" including \\"no accountability, lack of trust, and high teacher and administration turnover.\\" Another Alameda County Civil Grand Jury Report published a year later that financial instability was due to \\"the district‚Äôs poor business practices and broken culture,\\" rather than just outside pressures like declining enrollment. The report found that although the District ranked sixth in per-pupil state funding out of 37 Bay Area school districts, it had far above average spending on non-teaching costs and consultants, and lower than average spending on teachers and special education. Spending for supervisor and administrator salaries was found to be more than six times the statewide average. Under Superintendent Antwan Wilson, the report said, millions of dollars were wasted as capital projects were halted in the planning stages, and $172 million was spent on new construction projects, leaving the district's finances \\"in shambles.\\" The Board of Education responded that the new Blueprint for Quality Schools, the Citywide Plan, and the Plan for Fiscal Vitality, released between the Grand Jury's investigation and the publication of its report, had already addressed some of the Grand Jury's recommendations. The Board of Education also disagreed or partially disagreed with many of the report's findings. 2019 strike Oakland Unified teachers went on strike for seven days, beginning on February 21, 2019, for fully funded public education, higher wages, and smaller class size. The strikes were part of the RedforEd campaign and were organized by the Oakland Education Association (OEA)--a union for teachers‚Äîand East Bay Democratic Socialists of America (EBDSA). Oakland Unified School District is under populated with a total of 87 public schools, so they have a plan to close some public, unionized (and predominantly low-income) schools over the next few years in order to save money. $57 million meant for public-sector schools is funneled to the private-sector charter schools a year. Leading up to the strike there was a meeting with the Oakland Unified School District Board of Education in which the community of Roots Academy, a school facing closure, testified a plea to keep their school open. Teachers gathered at the #RedforEd rally January 12, demonstrating that they are strike-ready. In show of solidarity, ten non-union charter schools ‚Äúengaged in a wildcat sympathy strike‚Äù. Rallies continued as teachers from all around the Bay Area took a sick day on January 18, 2019 and gathered at Oakland Technical High School to march to city hall in the name of public education. In an interview at the ‚Äúsickout‚Äù, an Oakland teacher said ‚ÄúWe have not had a contract for several years‚Ä¶.The district is currently offering a 5% raise amounting to $70 extra which is not enough to keep up with the rising cost of housing in Oakland.‚Äù. 1 in 5 teachers leave Oakland Unified School District because they cannot afford to teach in the city they live in. When asked if they had enough resources to succeed, three Oakland Tech students replied ‚ÄúNo, we don‚Äôt even have paper in some of the class rooms. Some kids do not have textbooks and they have to do their work at home, where they may not have internet. Our classes are overfilled. Sometimes students will try to print their work in the library but there will be no paper if there is no librarian. We did not have a librarian this whole school year until last week.‚Äù. Bread for Ed raised more than $175,000 to feed children and families out of school, because ‚Äú73 percent of [Oakland] students depend on free or reduced lunch from their school‚Äù. The teachers struck for seven days. ‚Äú97% of students were out of school, and tens of thousands were on the picket lines‚Äù, according to Oakland Education Association. On February 28, 2019, OUSD ‚Äúreached a tentative agreement‚Äù with OEA. On Sunday, March 3, Oakland Education Association teachers voted to authorize a new contract to implement an 11 percent increase in teachers‚Äô salary for the next four years, plus a 3 percent bonus to account for losses during the strike. The agreement also demands to decrease class size, hold off school closures for five months, and have the district vote on whether or not to push the state for a moratorium of charter schools. Not all of the demands were granted, but the Oakland teacher strikes empowered the community to face the billionaire-backed operation to privatize education. Bond measures In 2012, voters passed Measure J, a $475 million school facilities bond. The 2018-2019 Alameda County Civil Grand Jury report found that mismanagement led to delays in the 21 projects that were to be funded with Measure J, and in 2018, nine of those projects were paused due to budget overruns and the district running out of funds. As of the publication of the Grand Jury report, $12.5 million of bond money had been spent over the prior four years on rented office space for central offices at 1000 Broadway following a flood in the administration building in 2014, despite questions about the legality of this practice. In November 2020, Measure Y will ask voters whether to issue $735 million in additional bonds. If passed, the bonds will fund more than 20 projects, including upgrading and expanding seven schools, safety improvements, and converting a closed school to a new alternative education and administrative building, but are only one fifth of the district's calculated financial need for construction projects. Schools The district- run schools includes 59 elementary schools, 13 middle schools, 19 high schools, with 9 alternative education schools and programs, 4 adult programs and early childhood education centers at most of the elementary schools. There are 38,000 K-12 students in district schools and more than 5,000 employees. Elementary and middle schoolsMontclair Elementary School= In 2015, Montclair Elementary was recognized with the nation's highest honor for a K-12 school, the Blue Ribbon award, which recognizes \\"exemplary teaching and learning\\". Only 10 schools in the Bay Area, public or private, received the award that year. Nearly half the students (47 percent) who attend Montclair come from outside the neighborhood. The East Bay Times reported, \\"One of the school's secrets to success is what (Principal Nancy) Bloom calls the morning intervention acceleration model. Used in the kindergarten, first and second grades, children meet once a week in groups with no more than four or five students and get targeted instruction that meets their individual needs. On the other days, the students are outside doing physical education.\\" The school serves an increasing number of English language learner students and students who receive free and reduced priced meals. In 2016, Collaborative for High Performance Schools praised Montclair Elementary's energy efficient design. =Coliseum College Preparatory Academy= In 2015, Coliseum College Prep Academy (CCPA), located on the Havenscourt Campus in East Oakland, achieved a 91 percent graduation rate. The school serves about 450 students and a large percentage are English language learners (170 students in 2014-15). CCPA's ethnic breakdown for the 2013‚Äì14 school year consisted of 42.7% Hispanic or Latino students, 28% Black or African American students, 13.2% Asian students, 9.8% White students, 2.6% students of two or more races, and 1.1% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander.

Next to the Stratford and Shaw Festivals, MTC has a higher annual attendance than any other theatre in the country. It was founded in 1958 by John Hirsch and Tom Hendry as an amalgamation of the Winnipeg Little Theatre and Theatre 77. In 2010, the theatre received a royal designation from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and officially became the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre It has a seating capacity of 785 and opened on October 31, 1970. History Bronze statue of Hendry and Hirsch When the Winnipeg Little Theatre and Theatre 77 merged to become the Manitoba Theatre Centre in 1958, it became the first of a network of \\"regional theatres\\" across North America. Artistic Director John Hirsch and General Manager Tom Hendry focused on classics, Broadway hits, and new Canadian work. A second stage for experimental work was established in 1960, and an annual provincial tour began in 1961. Since its founding, MTC has produced more than 600 plays with hundreds of actors, including Len Cariou, Graham Greene, Martha Henry, Judd Hirsch, Tom Hulce, William Hurt, Tom Jackson, Robert Lepage, Seana McKenna, Eric Peterson, Gordon Pinsent, Keanu Reeves, Fiona Reid, R.H. Thomson, Kathleen Turner and Al Waxman. MTC Warehouse theatre Today, the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre operates two theatre venues in Winnipeg, Manitoba- The John Hirsch Mainstage and the Tom Hendry Warehouse. Each season, MTC produces six Mainstage productions, four Warehouse Productions, an annual 12-day Winnipeg Fringe Theatre Festival, the Master Playwright Festival and a regional tour. MTC also provides student-only matinees with the Theatre for Young Audiences program, and scholarships and apprentice opportunities for post-secondary theatre students. The Jean Murray - Moray Sinclair Theatre Scholarship is funded purely from donations received during a run of a particular show each season. The Naomi Levin Theatre Scholarship was established in memory of Naomi Levin, a theatre technician associated with the MTC for a number of years. The theatres were renamed after the company's founders in 2008. In 2009, the Government of Canada designated the Mainstage theatre a National Historic Site. On October 26, 2010, Manitoba Theatre Centre received a Royal designation, becoming Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre. Architecture The Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre was designed in the Brutalist style by Winnipeg's Number Ten Architectural Group with input from artistic director Eddie Gilbert. With its exposed concrete sculptural form, an informal interior theatre space and a foyer originally conceived to balance large gatherings and smaller intimate groups in the same space, the Royal Manitoba Theatre Centre is one of Canada's most important small-scale Brutalist designs.

By then he had already published his first work, \\"Tumblebugs\\" (1942), a short story.Introduction by Leza Lowitz, in Botandoro by Donald Richie In 1947, Richie first visited Japan with the American occupation force, a job he saw as an opportunity to escape from Lima, Ohio. He first worked as a typist, and then as a civilian staff writer for the Pacific Stars and Stripes. While in Tokyo, he became fascinated with Japanese culture, particularly Japanese cinema. He was soon writing movie reviews in the Stars and Stripes. In 1948 he met Kashiko Kawakita who introduced him to Yasujir≈ç Ozu. During their long friendship, Richie and Kawakita collaborated closely in promoting Japanese film in the West.Donald Richie, \\"Remembering Madame Kawakita\\" in: A wreath for Madame Kawakita, Kawakita Memorial Film Institute, Tokyo 2008, pp. 5-7 He began composing contemporary music and released a title for ballet at that time.Yoshida, Yukihiko, Jane Barlow and Witaly Osins, ballet teachers who worked in postwar Japan, and their students, Pan-Asian Journal of Sports & Physical Education, Vol.3, Sep. 2012. After returning to the United States, he enrolled at Columbia University's School of General Studies in 1949 and received a B.S. degree in English in 1953. Richie then returned to Japan as film critic for The Japan Times and in 1959 published his first book, The Japanese Film: Art and Industry, coauthored with Joseph Anderson, which gave the first English language account of Japanese film. The greater tolerance in Japan for male homosexuality than in the United States was one reason he gave for returning to Japan, as he was openly bisexual. He spent much of the second half of the 20th century living and working alone in Tokyo, with the exception of a brief marriage to the American writer Mary Evans from 1961 to 1965. Richie served as Curator of Film at the New York Museum of Modern Art from 1969 to 1972. In 1988, he was invited to become the first guest director at the Telluride Film Festival. Donald Richie with portrait by Carl Randall, made at Richie's home in Ueno, Tokyo, 2006. Richie was a prolific author. Among his most noted works on Japan are The Inland Sea, a travel classic, and Public People, Private People, a look at some of Japan's most significant and most mundane people. He has compiled two collections of essays on Japan: A Lateral View and Partial Views. A collection of his writings has been published to commemorate fifty years of writing about Japan: The Donald Richie Reader. The Japan Journals: 1947-2004 consists of extended excerpts from his diaries. In 1991, film makers Lucille Carra and Brian Cotnoir produced a film version of The Inland Sea, which Richie narrated. Produced by Travelfilm Company, the film won numerous awards, including Best Documentary at the Hawaii International Film Festival (1991) and the Earthwatch Film Award. It screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 1992. Author Tom Wolfe described Richie as \\"the Lafcadio Hearn of our time, a subtle, stylish, and deceptively lucid medium between two cultures that confuse one another: the Japanese and the American.\\"Arturo Silva, ed. (2001). The Donald Richie Reader. Promotional blurb, Thomas Wolfe Although Richie spoke Japanese fluently, he could neither read nor write it proficiently. Richie died, aged 88, on February 19, 2013, in Tokyo. Japanese cinema Richie's most widely recognized accomplishments were his analyses of Japanese cinema. With each subsequent book, he focused less on film theory and more on the conditions in which the films were made. There was an emphasis on the \\"presentational\\" nature of Japan's cinema, in contrast to the \\"representational\\" films of the West. In the foreword to Richie's book A Hundred Years Of Japanese Film, Paul Schrader writes, \\"Whatever we in the West know about Japanese film, and how we know it, we most likely owe to Donald Richie.\\" Richie also penned analyses of two of Japan's best known filmmakers: Yasujir≈ç Ozu and Akira Kurosawa. Because Richie was a friend of Fumio Hayasaka, who composed music for the cinema, he first met Kurosawa on the set of Drunken Angel, the director's initial collaboration with Toshiro Mifune. Richie wrote the English subtitles for Akira Kurosawa's films Throne of Blood (1957), Red Beard (1965), Kagemusha (1980) and Dreams (1990). In the 21st century, Richie provided audio commentaries for The Criterion Collection on DVDs of various classic Japanese films, notably those of Ozu (A Story of Floating Weeds and Early Summer), Mikio Naruse (When a Woman Ascends the Stairs), and Kurosawa (Drunken Angel, Rashomon, The Lower Depths, and The Bad Sleep Well), among others.

It is located close to City Hall. The museum was designed by Herbert Henry Gatenby Moody of Moody and Moore in 1965. The museum is the largest heritage centre in Manitoba and focuses on human and natural heritage. It has planetarium shows and a Science Gallery hall. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at the Manitoba Museum. History of the Museum=Background In 1879, the Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba began officially to collect and preserve its heritage at some unknown location. In the early 1890s, E. Thompson Seton wrote about the Manitoba Museum, which was reportedly housed in the basement of Winnipeg's City Hall. Those collections appear to have been dispersed, and by 1900 there was no public museum in Winnipeg. There were, however, significant private collectors and from 1911 to the early 1920s material from their collections was exhibited in the Exposition Building of the former Winnipeg Industrial Bureau at Main and Water. The present museum holds some of these collections although most were dispersed. In 1932, the Natural History Society of Manitoba, the Winnipeg Board of Trade, and the Auditorium Commission founded the Manitoba Museum Association. The Manitoba Museum officially opened its doors on December 15, 1932 in the newly built Civic Auditorium (now the Provincial Archives Building) on Vaughan Street. The museum remained in that location, together with the Winnipeg Art Gallery, until 1967. Critical support for outreach programs and exhibits came from the Carnegie Corporation and Junior League. Professors at the University of Manitoba, formerly the Manitoba Agriculture College, played significant roles in the museum's development. The museum was run by volunteer Honorary Curators, with assistance from other dedicated volunteers and a small staff. As the museum grew in acquisitions and attendance, the need for an expanded facility became critical, and in 1954 the Board began planning a new institution, which would reflect the values of the time. They consulted extensively with the American Museum of Natural History and the Hayden Planetarium. Funding came in large part from federal project sources designed to create new Canadian cultural facilities for the 1967 Canadian Centennial commemoration. Establishment In 1964, a proposal for a museum and planetarium was submitted to the Manitoba government headed by Premier Duff Roblin. The proposal stated that: > Manitoba needs a Modern Museum of Man and Nature. Not a collection of > stuffed birds, antiquated firearms or dusty rocks ‚Äì but a living history of > man and his environment, tracing the evolution of Manitoba's resources, > industry and culture, past and present, and pointing the way, through > research, to the future. To inform, instruct and educate by interpreting > nature to man and their effect on each other in the function of a Modern > Museum of Man and Nature. In 1965, provincial legislation dissolved the unincorporated Manitoba Museum Association and incorporated the Manitoba Museum of Man and Nature and the Manitoba Planetarium, and the location as part of the planned Manitoba Centennial Centre was announced. Paid curatorial positions were created, and the former volunteer curators were appointed to the Museum Advisory Council. Most of the invaluable collections were transferred to the new corporation and during 1968-69, while the new building was being completed; the collections were put in storage. The planetarium was opened in 1968, two years prior to the museum's facilities opening in 1970. Lieutenant Governor Richard Bowles opened the Planetarium on May 15, 1968, and the new museum facilities were officially opened in July, 1970 by Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate the province's Centennial. At the time of the official opening only the Orientation Gallery and part of the Grasslands Gallery were finished. The planetarium and museum were integrated as one corporation in 1988, and in 1996 the corporate name returned to the original Manitoba Museum. The museum formally began using the name The Manitoba Museum in 2002. In 1994, the Hudson's Bay Company designated the museum as the permanent home for its historic material collection, which portrays more than three centuries of the company's colourful history. In 1996, construction got underway for a new wing to house this magnificent collection. The new wing was officially opened in September, 1998, and the new HBC Gallery opened on May 2, 2000. When the last major gallery, Parklands/Mixed Woods, opened in September 2003, the grand design for a museum to portray the human and natural history of all of Manitoba was complete. A renewed Science Gallery opened in 2008 replacing the 'Touch the Universe' Gallery. The plan calls for a separate Science Museum building next to the Manitoba Museum. An expanded Alloway Hall opened in the spring of 2017. The new Hall is in size, doubling the previous space. The Winnipeg Gallery opened November 1, 2019. The purpose of this gallery is to tell the story of Winnipeg's development over the past century. It features a stained glass logo of Winnipeg that used to be located at the old \\"gingerbread\\" City Hall, and has not been seen since the 1960s. The Manitoba Museum is in the process of upgrading its antiquated HVAC system in 2019.An interpretive gallery at the Manitoba Museum, 2010 Collections Nonsuch. The Manitoba Museum is the first Canadian museum to recreate marine life as it was 450 million years ago. A virtual underwater observatory shows the Hudson‚Äôs Bay region during the Ordovician period. Manitoba is home to the giant trilobite. The collections in the museum reflect the heritage of Manitoba. The interpretive galleries are Earth History, Arctic/Sub-Arctic, Boreal Forest, Nonsuch, Hudson's Bay Company, Parklands/Mixed Woods, Grasslands and Urban. Together these explore the history and environment of the province from its northern Arctic coast to its southern prairie grasslands. In particular the museum is famed for its Urban Gallery, which recreates a Winnipeg street scene in the 1920s. The full-size replica of the Nonsuch, the ship whose voyage in 1668 led to the founding of the Hudson's Bay Company, is the museum's showcase piece.

Located in the Snowy Monaro Regional Council, the valley is the site of one of four resort bases of the Perisher Ski Resort, which also comprises Guthega, Blue Cow and Smiggin Holes. It is located within the Kosciuszko National Park between Jindabyne and Charlotte Pass on the Kosciuszko Road. Access to the Valley is via the Skitube Alpine Railway or by road. Although it is primarily a winter only resort village, year round accommodations are available, including tours, and bush walks. At the , Perisher Village had a population of 149 people. In winter, the population is approximately 2,500 due to guests. Climate Perisher Valley has a subantarctic climate (K√∂ppen Dfc) with cool summers accompanied by a high diurnal range, wet springs and cold, snowy winters. There is some continental influence in the temperature pattern throughout the year. Snow depth Snow depth measurements are taken by Snowy Hydro at Spencers Creek, approximately west of Perisher Valley. Average depth curve Full record History Perisher Valley, New South Wales The Snowy Mountains region is thought to have had Aboriginal occupation for some twenty thousand years. Large scale intertribal gatherings were held in the High Country during summer for collective feasting on the Bogong moth. This practice continued until around 1865. European explorers entered the district from 1835, and in 1840, Edmund Strzelecki ascended Mount Kosciuszko and named it after a Polish patriot. High country stockmen followed who used the Snowy Mountains for grazing during the summer months. Banjo Paterson's famous poem The Man From Snowy River recalls this era. The cattle graziers have left a legacy of mountain huts scattered across the area. A story, which may be apocryphal, credits James Spencer, who settled in the area in the 1840s with saying 'What a perisher' when caught in a storm, giving origin to the Perisher area. The Kosciuszko National Park in which Perisher is situated came into existence as the National Chase Snowy Mountains on 5 December 1906. In 1944 this became the Kosciuszko State Park, and then the Kosciuszko National Park in 1967. Perisher snow fields The development of Skiing in Australia began at Kiandra in the Northern Snowy Mountains around 1861, but in the 20th century, the focus of Skiing in New South Wales shifted towards the Mount Kosciuszko region. The first Kosciuszko Chalet was built at Charlotte Pass in 1930, giving relatively comfortable access to Australia's highest terrain. The growing number of ski enthusiasts heading to Charlotte Pass led to the establishment of a cafe at Smiggin Holes, near Perisher Valley, around 1939, where horse-drawn sleighs would deliver skiers to be begin the arduous ski to the Kosciusko Chalet. It was the construction of the vast Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme from 1949 that really opened up the Snowy Mountains for large scale development of a ski industry and led to the establishment of Thredbo and Perisher as leading Australian resorts. The Construction of Guthega Dam brought skiers to the isolated Guthega district and a rope tow was installed there in 1957. Oversnow transport in Perisher village Ski Tube railway cars at New South Wales Blue Cow Terminal As the number of skiers increased, services, facilities and means of access were improved, and Perisher's first lodges were constructed. Telemark and the Snow Revellers Club being completed in 1952. In the winter of 1953 the first oversnow transport operated to Perisher Valley. It was greeted by the inhabitants with cheers and celebrations. In 1958, Svere Kaaten, another pioneer of the mountains, built a sophisticated rope tow at North Perisher. Ken Murray, an old friend of Svere's built another rope tow and Perisher's first T-bar. Development continued and Mount Perisher Double Chair was opened in 1962. After the opening of the first chairlift, T-bar expansion and rope tows, the Perisher area thrived. Murray Publishers Pty Limited was taken over by Australian Consolidated Press in 1972 and Kosciuszko Alpine Resorts was formed. Murray Publishers then traded under the name of Perisher Ski Resort which incorporated the resorts of Perisher and Smiggins. In 1995, Murray Publishers Pty Limited and the Alpine Australia Group Pty Limited merged to form Perisher Blue Pty Limited. The last establishment of a major skifield in NSW came with the development of Mount Blue Cow in the 1980s. In 1987 the Swiss designed Skitube Alpine Railway opened to deliver skiers from Bullocks Flat, on the Alpine Way, to Perisher Valley and to Blue Cow, which also opened in 1987. The operators of Blue Cow purchased Guthega in 1991, and the new combined resort later merged with Perisher-Smiggins to become the largest ski resort in the Southern Hemisphere. In 2009 Perisher had 48 lifts covering 1,245 hectares and four village base areas: Perisher Valley, Blue Cow, Smiggin Holes and Guthega. Snowy Mountains of Music Since 2009, Perisher Valley has been the host of the Snowy Mountains of Music Festival, a folk festival created by the same people behind the Illawarra Folk Festival. The festival runs every year on the Queen's Birthday Weekend, which is also the official start of the Ski Season for the Snowy Mountains. It acts as both a promotional festival for the Australian Snow Season, specifically, Perisher Valley, but also as an outlet for all sorts of Australian and International talent across a diverse range of genres.

Bioff soon became involved in criminal ventures, beginning with petty theft, then minor protection rackets and working his way up to pimping in Chicago's Levee vice district, of which he was later convicted in 1922. Bioff later worked for Harry and Jake \\"Greasy Thumb\\" Guzik where, through Guzik, Bioff met Al Capone and later Frank \\"The Enforcer\\" Nitti. In the 1930s, Nitti sent Bioff to California as an enforcer for Mafia- controlled union leader George Browne, who later became President of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees. Bioff, aided by John \\"Handsome Johnny\\" Rosselli, eventually became the collector for the Syndicate- controlled unions in Hollywood, extorting millions of dollars from major motion-picture studios, and keeping several hundred thousand for himself. As one source notes with irony: > Amusingly, Bioff, a glorified Chicago thug, went Hollywood in a big way with > his sudden wealth. But his fancy suits and solid gold business cards made > him too high profile ... ‚Äì hence the indictment. Bioff later threatened a strike against New York movie theaters by demanding two projectionists in each theater. When owners complained they would go broke under the terms he demanded, Bioff agreed to an arrangement for two projectionists in exchange for reduced pay, much of which went to Bioff. By the late 1930s, a newspaper campaign began bringing attention to the Bioff- Browne extortion operation, creating a huge scandal in Hollywood. He was exposed by conservative newspaper columnist Westbrook Pegler, who was trying to prove that criminal corruption was rampant in labor unions. Indictment and testimony In 1943, Bioff was indicted for tax evasion and related crimes, as well as extortion and racketeering, along with a number of his associates. Rather than face prison, Bioff testified against his companions, including Paul \\"The Waiter\\" Ricca, Philip D'Andrea, Charlie \\"Cherry Nose\\" Gioe, Johnny Rosselli, Lou Kaufman, and Frank \\"The Enforcer\\" Nitti. The defendants received 10-year sentences. Nitti committed suicide shortly after Bioff's testimony. Bioff received a reduced sentence along with Browne. Upon his release, Bioff moved to Arizona and assumed a new identity, \\"William Nelson\\", and reportedly developed a friendship with then Senator Barry Goldwater, even so far as going into business with the senator's nephew Bobby. Bioff, however, soon began working for Riviera Casino manager Gus Greenbaum, at the Chicago Outfit-owned Las Vegas casino. On November 4, 1955, shortly after the release of his former companions, Bioff was assassinated through a bombing described as follows: > Bioff walked out of his home and slid behind the wheel of his truck. A > moment later, an explosion rocked the neighborhood. Parts of Bioff and his > truck were strewn all over the driveway. Police found the remains of a > dynamite bomb wired to the starter. The killers were never found. See also *List of unsolved murders ReferencesBibliography *Kelly, Robert J. Encyclopedia of Organized Crime in the United States.

Queen Baghdad), was a Chobanid princess, the daughter of Chupan. She was the Empress consort of the Ilkhanate as the wife of Abu Sa'id Bahadur Khan. Family Baghdad Khatun was the daughter of Amir Chupan, who was the leading Mongol amir of the Ilkhanid period. She had four full brothers Hasan, Demasq Kaja, Timurtash and Shaikh Mahmoud. Marriages=Hasan Buzurg In 1323, Baghdad Khatun married Amir Shaikh Hasan Buzurg, the son of Amir Husayn Kurkan, the son of Amir Aq Buqa Jalayir. In 1325 Abu Sa'id, at the aged twenty, fell in love with Baghdad and wanted to marry her, although she was married to Shaikh Hasan. He requested her hand from her father Chupan through intermediaries. At that time it was understood that according to the Genggisid law any woman sought by the Khan was to be given a divorce by her husband and sent to the emperor's harem. On the other hand, Chupan did not obey Abu Sa'id's order in the case of his own daughter. In fact, Chupan did not refused his order openly, but he put him off. He sent his daughter and son-in-law to Qarabagh and Abu Sa'id to Baghdad for the winter. But after the winter, Chupan did not give any answer to Abu Sa'id and in order to relive the situation, he realized that the best course of action was for him to absent himself from the emperor‚Äôs court for a few days. When he went, he took vizier Giyath al-Mulk and other amirs, which provoked the Sultan against him. When Chupan left for Khurasan, the rival amirs instigated the Abu Sa'id against Chupan‚Äôs son Dimasq Kaja, and had him executed in 1327. After the execution of his son, Chupan spoke reproachfully about Abu Sa'id, and in a combat with his soldiers he was killed. Abu Sa'id After Chupan, there was no hindrance for Abu Sa‚Äòid to marry Baghdad. This time, he sent Qazi to ask Baghdad form her husband Hasan. Bagdad was divorced and married by Abu Sa'id. After her marriage, Baghdad began to take an active part in all administrative and fiscal affairs. Abu Said gave her very rich yarlighs, it means besides her political power, she had also very rich economic resources. She became very effective in political matters with vizier Giyath al-Din Mahmud Rashidi. She took revenge of her father and her brother. By using this opportunity she executed enemies of her father and her brothers. Abu Sa'id's mother, Hajji Khatun regarded Baghdad as a rival to her influence over Abu Sa'id. She received the title Khodawandigar (Great lord). Using her power, Baghdad Khatun prevented the marriage of Chupan's widow Korducin Khatun to Malik Ghiyath ud-Din of Herat, who had murdered her father in 1327. She had also managed to gain respectful treatment of her stepmother Sati Beg Khatun and Sati's son Surgan. In 1331-32, it was said that Baghdad Khatun and her former husband Shaikh Hasan met secretly, and even made a plan to kill Abu Sa'id. One year later, it was understood that this was only gossip, but this event curbed their power and he was appointed as governor of Anatolia. During this time, Abu Sa'id fell in love with Dilshad Khatun, Baghdad's niece, the daughter of Dimasq Kaja and granddaughter of Chupan. He divorced Baghdad and married her in 1333. Baghdad lost her power and authority to a great extent. At the end of life, he was not happy with his wives, but Dilshad loved very much. Therefore, Baghdad became very jealous. Death After Abu Sa'id's death in 1335, Arpa Ke'un was crowned on the Ilkhanid realm but Baghdad did not obeyed him and he executed her with the pretext of her secret alliance with the enemy √ñz Beg Khan and poisoning of Abu Sa'id. She was beaten to death by Khwaja Lulu, a Greek slave in the bath on 16 December 1335.

Most of them are placed to limit civil liability in lawsuits against the item's manufacturer or seller (see product liability). That sometimes results in labels which for some people seem to state the obvious. Government regulation In the United States warning labels were instituted under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938.Federal Food, Drug, & Cosmetic Act, Pub. L.

Marion's L'Optique (1867) Phantasmagoria (, also fantasmagorie, fantasmagoria) was a form of horror theatre that (among other techniques) used one or more magic lanterns to project frightening images such as skeletons, demons, and ghosts onto walls, smoke, or semi-transparent screens, typically using rear projection to keep the lantern out of sight. Mobile or portable projectors were used, allowing the projected image to move and change size on the screen, and multiple projecting devices allowed for quick switching of different images. In many shows the use of spooky decoration, total darkness, (auto-)suggestive verbal presentation, and sound effects were also key elements. Some shows added all kinds of sensory stimulation, including smells and electric shocks. Even required fasting, fatigue (late shows) and drugs have been mentioned as methods of making sure spectators would be more convinced of what they saw. The shows started under the guise of actual s√©ances in Germany in the late 18th century, and gained popularity through most of Europe (including Britain) throughout the 19th century. The word \\"phantasmagoria\\" has also been commonly used to indicate changing successions or combinations of fantastic, bizarre or imagined imagery. Etymology From French phantasmagorie, from Ancient Greek œÜŒ¨ŒΩœÑŒ±œÉŒºŒ± (ph√°ntasma, ‚Äúghost‚Äù) + possibly either Œ±Œ≥ŒøœÅŒ¨ (agor√°, ‚Äúassembly, gathering‚Äù) + the suffix -ia, or ·ºÄŒ≥ŒøœÅŒµœçœâ (agore√∫≈ç, ‚Äúto speak publicly‚Äù). Paul Philidor announced his show of ghost apparitions and evocation of the shadows of famous people as Phantasmagorie in the Parisian periodical Affiches, annonces et avis divers of December 16, 1792. About two weeks earlier the term had been the title of a letter by a certain \\"A.L.M.\\", published in Magazin Encyclop√©dique. The letter also promoted Phylidor's show. Phylidor had previously advertised his show as Phantasmorasi in Vienna in March 1790.Phylidor Phantasmorasi handbill. 1792-03 The English variation Phantasmagoria was introduced as the title of M. De Philipsthal's show of optical illusions and mechanical pieces of art in London in 1801.Paul de Philipsthal Phantasmagoria 1801 handbill De Philipsthal and Philidor are believed to have been the same person. History=Prelude (before 1750) Giovanni Fontana's drawing from circa 1420 of a figure with lantern projecting a winged demon Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits are thought to have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or magic lantern projections. By the 16th century necromantic ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan \\"magicians\\" and \\"witches\\" seemed commonplace. In the 1589 version of Magia Naturalis, Giambattista della Porta described how to scare people with a projected image. A picture of anything that would terrify the beholder should be placed in front of a camera obscura hole, with several torches around it. The image should be projected onto a sheet hanging in the middle of the nascent dark chamber, where spectators wouldn't notice the sheet but only see the projected image hanging in the air. In his 1613 book Opticorum Libri Sex Belgian Jesuit mathematician, physicist and architect Fran√ßois d'Aguilon described how some charlatans cheated people out of their money by claiming they knew necromancy and would raise the specters of the devil from hell and show these to the audience inside a dark room. The image of an assistant with a devil's mask was projected through a lens into the dark room, scaring the uneducated spectators. The earliest pictures known to have been projected with lanterns were Death, hell and monsters: * Giovanni Fontana's 1420 drawing showed a lantern projecting a winged female demon. * Athanasius Kircher warned in his 1646 edition of Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae that impious people could abuse his stenographic mirror projection system by painting a picture of the devil on the mirror and projecting it into a dark place to force people to carry out wicked deeds. His pupil Gaspar Schott later turned this into the idea that it could be easily used to keep godless people from committing many sins, if a picture of the devil was painted on the mirror and thrown onto a dark place.Huygens' 1659 sketches for a projection of Death taking off his head * In 1659 Dutch inventor Christiaan Huygens drew several phases of Death removing his skull from his neck and putting it back again, which were sketches meant for a projection with \\"convex lenses and a lamp\\". This lamp later became known as the magic lantern and the sketches form the oldest known extant documentation of this invention. * One of Christiaan Huygens' contacts wrote to him in 1660: \\"The good Kircher is always performing tricks with the magnet at the gallery of the Collegium Romanum; if he would know about the invention of the Lantern he would surely frighten the cardinals with specters.\\" * Thomas Rasmussen Walgensten's 1664 lantern show prompted Pierre Petit to call the device \\"laterne de peur\\" (lantern of fear). In 1670 Walgensten projected an image of Death at the court of King Frederick III of Denmark. * In 1668 Robert Hooke wrote about a type of magic lantern installation: \\"It produces effects not only very delightful, but to such as know not the contrivance very wonderful; so that spectators not well versed in optics, that should see the various apparitions and disappearances, the motions, changes and actions that may this way be represented, would readily believe them to be supernatural and miraculous.\\" * In the 1671 second edition of Kircher's Ars Magna Lucis et Umbrae. the magic lantern was illustrated with projections of Death and a person in purgatory or hellfire. Kircher did suggest in his book that an audience would be more astonished by the sudden appearance of images if the lantern would be hidden in a separate room, so the audience would be ignorant of the cause of their appearance. According to legend Kircher secretly used the lantern at night to project the image of Death on windows of apostates to scare them back into church, but this is probably based on Gaspar Schott's suggestion (see above). * In 1672 French physician and numismatist Charles Patin was very impressed with the lantern show that \\"Monsieur Grundler\\" (Griendel) performed for him in Nuremberg: \\"He even stirs the shadows at his pleasure, without the aid of the underworld. (...) My esteem for his knowledge could not prevent my fright, I believed there never was a greater magician than him in the world. I experienced paradise, I experienced hell, I experienced specters. I have some constancy, but I would have willingly given one half to save the other.\\" After these apparitions Griendel showed other subjects in this performance, including birds, a palace, a country-wedding and mythical scenes. Patin's elaborate description of an early lantern show seems to be the oldest to contain more than frightening pictures. While surviving slides and descriptions of lantern shows from the following decades included all kinds of subjects, scary pictures remained popular. Late 18th century The last decades of the 18th century saw the rise of the age of Romanticism. There was an obsession with the bizarre and the supernatural. This movement had elements of the bizarre and irrational, and included the rise of the Gothic novel. The popular interest in such topics explained the rise and, more specifically, the success of phantasmagoria for the productions to come. The magic lantern was a good medium with which to project fantasies as its imagery was not as tangible as in other media. Since demons were believed to be incorporeal, the magic lantern could produce very fitting representations. Illustration of hidden magic lantern projection on smoke in Guyot's Nouvelles r√©cr√©ations physiques et math√©matiques (1770) When magicians started to use the magic lantern in shows, some special effects were thought up. French physician, inventor and manufacturer of conjuring apparatus and scientific instruments Edm√©-Gilles Guyot described several techniques in his 1770 book Nouvelles r√©cr√©ations physiques et math√©matiques, including the projection of ghosts on smoke. Johann Georg Schrepfer In the early 1770s in Leipzig, Germany, coffeehouse owner, charlatan, necromancer and leader of an independent Freemason lodge Johann Georg Schrepfer (or Schr√∂pfer) performed ghost-raising s√©ances and necromantic experiments for his Freemason lodge. For typical necromantic activity, his followers were asked to fast for 24 hours and were served a salad (possibly drugged) and much punch before the midnight start of s√©ances in a darkened room with a black-draped altar. A robed Schrepfer performed the rituals and demanded his followers remain seated at a table or else face terrible dangers. He made use of a mixture of Masonic, Catholic, and Kabbalistic symbolism, including skulls, a chalk circle on the floor, holy water, incense, and crucifixes. The spirits he raised were said to be clearly visible, hovering in the air, vaporous, and sometimes screaming terribly. The highlight of his career was a s√©ance for the court in the Dresden palace early in the summer of 1774. This event was impressive enough to still be described more than a century later in Germany and Britain. Apparitions reportedly raised by Schrepfer over the years included Frederick III, Elector of Saxony, the beheaded Danish \\"traitors\\" Johann Friedrich Struensee and Enevold Brandt with their heads in their hands, and the Knights Templars' last Grand Master Jacques de Molay. During a s√©ance in Dresden, Schrepfer ordered De Molay's spirit to take a letter to a companion in Frankfurt. De Molay obeyed and returned half an hour later with an answer signed in Frankfurt by the companion. Another spirit appeared engulfed in flames begging Schrepfer not to torture him so. In the early morning of October 8, 1774, Schrepfer reportedly committed suicide with a pistol in a park with five friends present. According to legend he was a victim of delusions about his necromantic abilities and convinced he could resurrect himself afterwards. However, there are several indications that he may actually have been murdered.Otto Werner F√∂rster: Tod eines Geistersehers. Johann Georg Schrepfer. Eine vertuschte s√§chsische Staatsaff√§re, 1774. Taurus Verlag Leipzig, 2011 Most spectators of Schrepfer's s√©ances were convinced that the apparitions they saw were real. No clear evidence of deceit seems to ever have been found, but critics have described several suspicions. The techniques that Schrepfer reportedly used for his elaborate effects included actors performing as ghosts, ventriloquism, hidden speaking tubes, glass harmonica sounds, aromatic smoke, camera obscura projections and/or magic lantern projections on smoke, concave mirror projections and staged thunder. Schrepfer had been friends with pharmacist and Freemason Johann Heinrich Linck the Younger and regularly held lodge meetings at Linck's garden house. Linck could have been helping Schrepfer with drugs and chemicals and also knew about the workings of optical and acoustic devices. Linck owned a magic lantern which was decorated with a crucifix and a skull with wings. Soon after Schrepfer's death, there was a boom of publications attacking or defending his supposed abilities to raise ghosts, expanding Schrepfer's fame across Europe. Several publications included explanations of techniques he might have used to conjure apparitions, which inspired several people to recreate Schrepfer's s√©ances. Christlieb Benedikt Funk, Professor of Physics at the Leipzig University, was possibly the first to publicly recreate such ghost-raising demonstrations; however, he was ordered to stop by the university's authorities. Physicist Phylidor The magician \\"physicist\\" Phylidor, also known as \\"Paul Filidort\\" and probably the same as Paul de Philipsthal, created what may have been the first true phantasmagoria show in 1790. After a first ghost-raising session in Berlin in 1789 led to accusations of fraud and expulsion from Prussia, Phylidor started to market his necromantic shows as an art that revealed how charlatans fooled their audiences. His improved show, possibly making use of the recently invented Argand lamp,Grau, Oliver. Remember the Phantasmagoria! chapter from MediaArtHistories, MIT Press/Leonardo Books, 2007, p. 144 was a success in Vienna from 1790 to 1792. Phylidor advertised these shows as \\"Schr√∂pferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister-Erscheinungen\\" (Schr√∂pfer-esque and Cagiostro-esque Ghost Apparitions)Phylidor Schr√∂pferischen, und Cagliostoischen Geister- Erscheinungen flyer 1790 and as \\"Phantasmorasi\\". Renowned German showman Johann Carl Enslen (1759-1848) is thought to have purchased Philidor's equipment when Phylidor left Vienna in 1792. He presented his own phantasmagoria shows in Berlin, with the King of Prussia attending a show on 23 June 1796. Enslen moved the lantern to produce the illusion of moving ghosts and used multiple lanterns for transformation effects. There were other showmen who followed in Phylidor's footsteps, including \\"physicist\\" Von Halbritter who even adapted the name of Phylidor's shows as \\"Phantasmorasie - Die nat√ºrliche Geister-Erscheinung nach der Schr√∂pferischen Erfindung\\". From December 1792 to July 1793 \\"Paul Filidort\\" presented his \\"Phantasmagorie\\" in Paris,Affiches, annonces et avis divers. 1793-07-23 probably using the term for the first time. It is assumed Etienne-Gaspard Robertson visited one of these shows and was inspired to present his own \\"Fantasmagorie\\" shows a few years later.Mervyn Heard, Phantasmagoria (2006), p. 87. In October 1801 a phantasmagoria production by Paul de Philipsthal opened in London's Lyceum Theatre in the Strand, where it became a smash hit. Robertson Robert's phantasmagoria at the Cour des Capucines in 1797 √âtienne-Gaspard \\"Robertson\\" Robert, a Belgian inventor and physicist from Li√®ge, became the best known phantasmagoria showman. He is credited for coining the word fantascope, and would refer to all of his magic lanterns by this term. The fantascope was not a magic lantern that could be held by hand, but instead required someone to stand next to it and physically move the entire fantascope closer or further to the screen. He would often eliminate all sources of light during his shows in order to cast the audience in total darkness for several minutes at a time. Robertson would also lock the doors to the theater so that no audience member could exit the show once it had started. He was also known for including multiple sound effects into his show, such as thunder clapping, bells ringing, and ghost calls. Robertson would pass his glass slides through a layer of smoke while they were in his fantascope, in order to create an image that looked out of focus. Along with the smoke, he would also move most of his glass slides through his fantascope very quickly in order to create the illusion that the images were actually moving on screen. Robertson's first \\"Fantasmagorie\\" was presented in 1797 at the Pavillon de l'Echiquier in Paris.Castle, Terry. \\"Phantasmagoria and the Metaphorics of Modern Reverie.\\" The Female Thermometer. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 1995. 140‚Äì167. Print. The macabre atmosphere in the post-revolutionary city was perfect for Robertson's Gothic extravaganza complete with elaborate creations and Radcliffean d√©cor. After discovering that he could put the magic lantern on wheels to create either a moving image or one that increased and decreased in size, Robertson moved his show. He sited his entertainment in the abandoned cloisters kitchen of a Capuchin convent (which he decorated to resemble a subterranean chapel) near the Place Vend√¥me. He staged hauntings, using several lanterns, special sound effects and the eerie atmosphere of the tomb. This show lasted for six years, mainly because of the appeal of the supernatural to Parisians who were dealing with the upheavals as a result of the French Revolution. Robertson mainly used images surrounded by black in order to create the illusion of free-floating ghosts. He also would use multiple projectors, set up in different locations throughout the venue, in order to place the ghosts in environments. For instance, one of his first phantasmagoria shows displayed a lightning-filled sky with both ghosts and skeletons receding and approaching the audience. In order to add to the horror, Robertson and his assistants would sometimes create voices for the phantoms. Often, the audience forgot that these were tricks and were completely terrified: In fact, many people were so convinced of the reality of his shows that police temporarily halted the proceedings, believing that Robertson had the power to bring Louis XVI back to life. Once the show was back, Robertson was exposed to the law again, this time in the form of a lawsuit against his former assistants who had started their own phantasmagoria shows using his techniques. It was this lawsuit in 1799 in which Robertson was required to reveal his secrets to the public and magic lantern shows popped up across Europe and in the United States shortly after, though many were not as elaborate as Robertson's. United States Phantasmagoria came to the United States in May 1803 at Mount Vernon Garden, New York. Much like the French Revolution sparked interest in phantasmagoria in France, the expanding frontier in the United States made for an atmosphere of uncertainty and fear that was ideal for phantasmagoria shows. Many others created phantasmagoria shows in the United States over the next couple of years, including Martin Aub√©e, one of Robertson's former assistants. Further history Thomas Young proposed a system that could keep the projected image in focus for a lantern on a small cart with rods adjusting the position of the lens when the cart was wheeled closer or further away from the screen. John Evelyn Barlas was an English poet who had written for several phantasmagoria shows during the late 1880s. He used the pseudonym Evelyn Douglas for most of the works written for phantasmagoria. He has written several different works, most of them focusing on the idea of dreams and nightmares. Some of his works include Dreamland, A Dream of China, and Dream Music. His work is known for including extravagant descriptions of settings with multiple colors. Most of Barlas' work also mentions flames and fire. The flames are meant to represent the burning of emotions laced throughout Barlas' poems, and fit well within the realm of phantasmagoria. By the 1840s phantasmagoria became already outmoded, though the use of projections was still employed, just in different realms: In other media Before the rise of phantasmagoria, interest in the fantastic was apparent in ghost stories. This can be seen in the many examples of ghost stories printed in the 18th century, including Admiral Vernon's ghost; being a full true and particular Account as how a Warlike apparition appeared last Week to the Author, Clad all in Scarlet, And discoursed to him concerning the Present State of Affairs (1758). In this tale, the author's reaction to the ghost he sees is much like that of the audience members at the phantasmagoria shows. He says that he is \\"thunderstruck\\", and that \\"astonishment seized me. My bones shivered within me. My flesh trembled over me. My lips quaked. My mouth opened. My hands expanded. My knees knocked together. My blood grew chilly, and I froze with terror.\\"\\"Admiral Vernon's ghost; being a full true and particular Account as how a Warlike apparition appeared last Week to the Author, Clad all in Scarlet, And discoursed to him concerning the Present State of Affairs\\" Printed for E. Smith, Holborn (1758): 1‚Äì8. Print.\\" French painters of the time, including Ingres and Girodet, derived ideas for paintings from the phantasmagoria, and its influence spread as far as J. M. W. Turner.Michael Charlesworth, Landscape and Vision in 19th century Britain and France (Ashgate, 2008), Chapter Two, \\"Ghosts and Visions\\". Walter Benjamin was fascinated by the phantasmagoria and used it as a term to describe the experience of the Arcades in Paris. In his essays, he associated phantasmagoria with commodity culture and its experience of material and intellectual products. In this way, Benjamin expanded upon Marx's statement on the phantasmagorical powers of the commodity.Cohen, Margaret. \\"Walter Benjamin's Phantasmagoria.\\" New German Critique 48 (1989): 87‚Äì107. Print. Early stop trick films developed by Georges M√©li√®s most clearly parallel the early forms of phantasmagoria. Trick films include transformations, superimpositions, disappearances, rear projections, and the frequent appearance of ghosts and apparent decapitations.\\"Overview of Edison Motion Pictures by Genre\\". The Library of Congress. The Library of Congress, 13 Jan 1999. Web. Modern-day horror films often take up many of the techniques and motifs of stop trick films, and phantasmagoria is said to have survived in this new form. Maria Jane Jewsbury produced a volume entitled Phantasmagoria, or Sketches of Life and Literature, published by Hurst Robinson & Co, in 1825. This consists of a number of essays on various subjects together with poetry. The whole is dedicated to William Wordsworth. Phantasmagoria is also the title of a poem in seven cantos by Lewis Carroll that was published by Macmillan & Sons in London in 1869, about which Carroll had much to say. He preferred that the title of the volume be found at the back, saying in a correspondence with Macmillan, \\"it is picturesque and fantastic‚Äîbut that is about the only thing I like‚Ä¶\\" He also wished that the volume would cost less, thinking that the 6 shillings was about 1 shilling too much to charge.Cohen, Morton N. \\"Lewis Carroll and the House of Macmillan\\". Cambridge University Press 7 (1979):31‚Äì70. Print. Phantasmagoria's influence on Disney can be found in the countless effects throughout the themed lands and attractions at the theme parks but are likely most memorable in the practical and projection effects of the Haunted Mansion (at Disneyland, Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disneyland), and Phantom Manor (at Disneyland Paris), as well live shows such as Fantasmic (at Disneyland and Disney's Hollywood Studios), which feature film/video projections on water screens. A series of photographs taken from 1977 to 1987 by photographer and model Cindy Sherman are described as portraying the phantasmagoria of the female body. Her photographs include herself as the model, and the progression of the series as a whole presents the phantasmagoric space projected both onto and into the female body.Mulvey, Laura. \\"A Phantasmagoria of the Female Body: The Work of Cindy Sherman.\\" New Left Review I.188 (July‚ÄìAugust 1991): 137‚Äì150. Web. The 1995 survival-horror video game Phantasmagoria is partly based upon these performances. In the game, several flashbacks are shown to fictional phantasmagorias performed by the magician \\"Carno\\". However, unlike the real shows, his are much more graphic and violent in nature. In modern times A few modern theatrical troupes in the United States and United Kingdom stage phantasmagoria projection shows, especially at Halloween. From February 15 to May 1, 2006, the Tate Britain staged \\"The Phantasmagoria\\" as a component of its show \\"Gothic Nightmares: Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination.\\" It recreated the content of the 18th and 19th century presentations, and successfully evoked their tastes for horror and fantasy. In 2006, David J. Jones discovered the precise site of Robertson's show at the Capuchin convent. See David J.

The communities of Denman Island and Hornby Island are also considered part of the Comox Valley. The Comox Valley contains the 47th largest metropolitan area in Canada with a population of about 66,000 as of 2016. Geography Comox Glacier The Comox Valley is a lowland area with deep alluvial soil. There are mountains to the west, and the Comox Glacier overlooks the valley, On the east, beaches stretch along the shore of the Strait of Georgia. History According to researcher Samuel Bawlf, Sir Francis Drake visited this area in 1579. This assertion is written about in The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake, 1577‚Äì1580 and suggests that Drake's reference to landing in what he called New Albion (the name of the region of North America explored by Drake) was, in fact, what is now known as Comox.Bawlf, Samuel (2003). The Secret Voyage of Sir Francis Drake, 1577‚Äì1580. . This conclusion is not shared, however, by other historians such as Jules Verne and Samuel Johnson. According to the Canadian Encyclopedia, first contact in Comox between the original First Nations inhabitants and the first European visitors occurred in 1792 when HMS Discovery anchored in Comox Harbour.Artibise, A. (2010). \\"Comox\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, Historica- Dominion. Retrieved on: 2011-11-03. The Grappler There were three groups of indigenous people, the Comox, the Pentlatch (who were then nearly extinct), and the Lekwiltok, in the valley. They farmed in the rich soil there, keeping the land cleared through burning. The first European settlers arrived in the spring of 1861, intending to start farms. At that time, Governor James Douglas was encouraging settlers arriving in the Colony of Vancouver Island to establish themselves in the Cowichan Valley and the Comox Valley rather than the gold fields of the mainland as these were the two areas that had agricultural potential on the island. The first settlers were Nanaimo coal miners and Hudson's Bay Company employees, John and William Biggs, Thomas Dignan, Edwin Gough, Adam Grant Horne, Thomas Jones, Alexander McFarlane, George Mitchell, Thomas Williams and Charles York all of whom had arrived on Vancouver Island before the 1858 gold rush. Of these, only Mitchell remained by 1862 when the Grappler arrived with the Comox Expedition. Dignan went to Gabriola Island. Horne and most of the others went to Nanaimo. A small pox epidemic in 1862 decimated the native population. In 1862, Surveyor General Pemberton secured funding from the colonial government in Victoria to construct the first road into the Comox area from Nanaimo. When it became clear that a wide wagon road would be too expensive, a bridle path with some bridges was built instead. Flooding and tree falls made maintenance of this road impossible. Until the mid-1890s, access to the area was by sea. In 1874 the government wharf and the first bridge over the Courtenay River were constructed. The area became the centre of one of the British Empire's largest private railway concerns, the Comox Logging & Railway Company. It was also the headquarters of Comox Logging, which owned Block 29, a valuable stand of Douglas Fir timber, stretching from south of Courtenay well to the north of Campbell River. For a number of years, logging was the largest source of employment in the community. Logging and mining declined in the 1960s, and fishing later declined in the 1990s. At that time the region was one of the fastest growing in British Columbia, although the growth rate between 2001 and 2006 has averaged just 2.0% annually. Most workers in the logging industry commuted to camps and logging operations further north on the Island or the mainland Coast; the Field lumber mill in Courtenay was disassembled in the fall of 2006. Today=Economy Since 2008, the area has been in the Comox Valley Regional District. The growth industries in the Comox Valley in recent years are tourism and construction. A ski resort at nearby Mount Washington brings in tourists. The Canadian Forces in the form of CFB Comox contributes to the local economy as well. The service sector accounts for over 50% of employment. The lumber resources of Comox Logging are now owned by TimberWest and are being cut for the second time. The remaining forest resources in Comox Valley are scattered amongst small woodlots on individual farms, or in isolated parks. There is air service direct to Calgary and points south and east, as well as Edmonton. Culture In 2007 the area was designated one of Canada's \\"Cultural Capitals\\" by Canadian Heritage.Government of Canada. 2007 Cultural Capitals of Canada. Canadian Heritage. Retrieved on: 2011-11-03. A number of music and arts events are undertaken in the region. The community also has a number of volunteer and non-profit organizations devoted to cultural pursuits.

With a population of approximately 43,700 , it is the second largest town in the District Rems-Murr-Kreis. The area of the town is . Fellbach was first mentioned as Velbach in 1121. It was called Vellebach in 1357 and the name Fehlbach was used in around 1800. On 14 October 1933, it was declared a city. After World War II it reached a population of more than 20,000 in 1950 and therefore received the status \\"Gro√üe Kreisstadt\\". Fellbach has 3 main districts: Fellbach, Schmiden (since 1 January 1973) and Oeffingen (since 1 April 1974). Geography=Geographical location Fellbach is located south of the Neckar basin on a plateau between the Neckar and Rems valley at the northern foothills of the Schurwald. The highest points are the Kappelberg (Baden-W√ºrttemberg) (469.0 m) and the Kernen (hill) (513.2 m). The metropolitan area extends north into the so-called \\"Schmidener Feld\\". Neighboring communities The following cities and towns adjacent to the city of Fellbach. They are starting clockwise to the east: Waiblingen and Kernen im Remstal (both Rems-Murr-Kreis), Stuttgart (city district) and Remseck am Neckar (district of Ludwigsburg). Constituent The city Fellbach consists of the core city and the two districts Schmiden (incorporated on 1 January 1973 and Oeffingen (incorporatedon 1 April 1974). In the field of Fellbach are five separate villages. For Fellbach owns the city Fellbach and the place Lindle. To Oeffingen includes the place Oeffingen and the homestead Tennhof and to Schmiden the place Schmiden. Furthermore, there are in the urban area Fellbach the dialed villages Erbach, Immenrot and Gretenbach.Das Land Baden-W√ºrttemberg. Amtliche Beschreibung nach Kreisen und Gemeinden. Band III: Regierungsbezirk Stuttgart, Regionalverband Mittlerer Neckar. Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart 1978, . S. 521‚Äì524 History Fellbach was first mentioned as \\"Velbach\\" in 1121. The name \\"Velebach\\" appeared in 1357 and \\"Fehlbach\\" in 1800. Several landlords had possessions in Fellbach, the House W√ºrttemberg bought piece by piece. First, the village belonged to Oberamt Cannstatt. After its dissolution in 1923 Fellbach came to Oberamt Waiblingen, this became in 1938 Waiblingen district. After Fellbach had grown to the largest W√ºrttemberg village, the community was named October 14, 1933 for city. After World War II, the population crossed the 20,000 threshold. Therefore, Fellbach was appointed on April 1, 1956 to the district town in the district of Waiblingen. *Schmiden was first mentioned in 1225 as \\"Smidheim\\". Schmiden first belonged to Oberamt Waiblingen and only came in 1718 to Oberamt Cannstatt. After its dissolution in 1923 it came again to Oberamt Waiblingen, later district Waiblingen. *Oeffingen was 789 first mentioned as \\"Villa Uffingen im Neckargau\\". Since this did not import the Reformation, Oeffingen remained Catholic. In 1618 Oeffingen was sold to the Chapter Augsburg and came due to the secularisation of 1803 to the Kingdom of Bavaria. The place was finally annexed in 1810 and assigned to Oberamt Cannstatt. After its dissolution in 1923 it came to Oberamt Waiblingen, later district Waiblingen. Religions 1534 in W√ºrttemberg the Reformation was introduced. The present church of the city is the Lutheran Church, which was built mainly in the 15th century. In addition to the Lutheran Church there is the Pauluskirche (built in 1927) and the Melanchthonkirche (built in 1964) and in the neighborhood Lindle the Johannes-Brenz-Kirche. Also in the district Schmiden the Reformation was introduced by W√ºrttemberg. In Oeffingen has only existed since 1970 a separate Protestant church and parish. All Protestants of Fellbach belonged initially to the deanery or church district Cannstatt, today to deanery or church district Waiblingen of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in W√ºrttemberg. Catholics: After the Reformation, there were no more Catholics. Only in the 19th century Catholics returned and built in 1923 their own church (St. Johannes). 1967, was built a second church, Maria Regina Kirche. Due to immigration of Catholics was built an own Catholic church (Holy Trinity). Since 1961 Schmiden has its own parish. Oeffingen was a Catholic enclave in Protestant W√ºrttemberg. In Oeffingen was an old Catholic church in the outskirts, which was heavily damaged by an air raid during World War II. The present church of Christus K√∂nig was built 1968. All three parishes of Fellbach are within the deanery Rems-Murr of the Diocese of Rottenburg- Stuttgart. The New Apostolic Church was erected in 1983 with 1,400 seats. In addition to two large churches there are in Fellbach, a Greek Orthodox church and several free churches, among them the United Methodist Church, the Mennonite church and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.

In the fields around Fellbach, Schmiden and Oeffingen grain and corn are preferably grown. Great importance had once the greenhouses. Retail The commercial life was marked up until the 1990s by the retail trade. With the structural changes here there was a profound change. Many of the long-established retail stores were closed by competitive pressure and a changing consumer behavior. Commuter Districts developed mainly to commuters living communities. However, there are now also numerous companies, especially in the metal sector.

Alte Kelter Fellbach In Old-Fellbach, former wine village at the foot of Kappel Berg, still dominate rural timbered houses from the 16th to the 18th century the big picture. Noteworthy is also the Fellbacher industrial architecture. By ill modernization in recent decades the historically grown building structures were ever broken, so that Fellbach has no longer a uniform cityscape today. Even the recent urban redevelopment measure are again several half-timbered houses like by demolition victims, including in the area of newly built Fellbacher market and currently in the rear street. In the 1950s, emerged on the outskirts several skyscrapers and numerous interspersed with green areas living quarters in the lower town. With the eastern ring road, built in 1989, the population threshold was further postponed into Schmidenen field. In contrast, the Western, aligned against Stuttgart suburbs long remained untouched, even to a possible annexation by the state capital counteract. Currently, this is where a large-sized combined indoor and outdoor pool is built.

Their main product was PC/TCP, a full-featured, standards- compliant TCP/IP package for DOS. The company was based in Andover, Massachusetts. It also had a number of offices throughout the United States and overseas.  Origins  The core open-source software was developed at MIT starting in 1982 as the PC/IP project, a project to make PCs into first-class citizens on TCP/IP networks. This project began as a Telnet implemented by Louis J. KonopelskiLouis J. Konopelski, \\"Implementing Internet Remote Login on a Personal Computer\\", bachelor's thesis, MIT, December 1982. Also available as MIT-LCS-TM-233 under the supervision of Jerome Saltzer. Later contributors to the PC/IP project included John Romkey, David Bridgham, David D. Clark, and Donald W. Gillies. FTP Software was the first of many companies to name themselves after an Internet protocol. At the time the company was founded, the PC/IP software package was already being sold by Wollongong, 3Com and others, and so some of the inventors of PC/IP decided to exploit their own product. After Donald W. Gillies produced a full-function multi-connection TCP and compatible SMTP for his bachelor's thesis, a mail proxy,Donald W. Gillies, \\"Improved network security with a trusted email relay\\", bachelor's thesis, MIT, June 1984 it became possible to offer an FTP implementation - which requires two concurrent TCPs. This software, known as \\"ntcp\\" (new TCP) in the source tree, could support seven connections on a 128KB IBM PC-XT, and could interoperate with ten different operating systems.Donald W. Gillies, personal communication to John Romkey, 1993 The multi-connection TCP languished in the source tree for two years before the FTP founders chose to make it the core of FTP Software, setting the company apart from the other competitors in this space, which were not actively improving PC/IP and were not willing to implement the FTP protocol based upon \\"ntcp\\".  Fate  Initially PC/TCP's protocol stacks and network interface drivers were linked into individual application executables, as with PC/IP. By 1990, all PC/TCP applications shared a TSR kernel, which itself (initially) used built-in network interface drivers. By 1991, John Romkey's TSR PC/TCP Packet Driver specification had largely replaced the built-in drivers. The company had a good run, with a valuation of over $1 billion at one point, but suffered greatly from both internal and external pressures. It had grown rapidly and repeatedly moved physically farther away from its roots at MIT. The founders, though technically adept, were inexperienced as managers. They suffered from in- fighting, epitomized in a public divorce between two of the founders. The company went public in 1994, and maintained profitable growth through 1995, as a dominant supplier of TCP stacks for x86-based machines. When Microsoft included a TCP stack at no extra cost in Windows 95 (as has become standard with all operating systems), FTP lost a significant revenue source. Due to management (which by that time was mostly non-founders) failing to adequately prepare for the transition into supplying network-using applications, FTP was not able meet Wall Street's expectations and its stock price declined sharply. In May 1996, FTP Software announced it was providing Microsoft with various technology for Internet Explorer 2.0 for Windows 3.1, including a PPP network, 16-bit email client, and other technology.\\"FTP Software to provide key technology for Microsoft's Internet Explorer Version 2.0 for Windows 3.1\\" Business Wire, May 1, 1996 In 1998, FTP Software was bought out by former rival NetManage.

It was developed by Epic Games and published by Microsoft Game Studios, initially as an exclusive title for the Xbox 360 in November 2006, before a Microsoft Windows version of the game, developed in conjunction with People Can Fly, was released in 2007. The game's main story, which can be played in single or co-operative play, focuses on a squad of troops who assist in completing a desperate, last-ditch attempt to end a war against a genocidal subterranean enemy, the Locust, and save the remaining human inhabitants of their planet Sera. The game's multiplayer mode allows up to eight players to control characters from one of the two factions in a variety of online game modes. Gameplay features players using cover and strategic fire in order to win battles. The game was a commercial success, selling over three million copies within ten weeks of its launch. It became the fastest selling video game of 2006, the second-most played game over Xbox Live during 2007, and the 6th best selling Xbox 360 game. Considered one of the seventh generation of video gaming's most significant titles, the game received universal critical acclaim for its gameplay and detailed visuals, with it winning over 30 \\"Game of the Year\\" awards in 2006. A remastered version, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, was developed primarily by The Coalition, and brought about a number of improvements, including updates to the gameplay from later titles and enhanced graphics. Ultimate Edition was released for the Xbox One in August 2015, and for Microsoft Windows in March 2016. Gears of War's success led to the development of a franchise, including four sequels (Gears of War 2 in 2008, Gears of War 3 in 2011, Gears of War 4 in 2016, and Gears 5 in 2019) and two prequels, Gears of War: Judgment, which was released in 2013 and Gears Tactics which was released in 2020. In addition, it has also spawned adaptations for books and comics, and a film based on the series is currently in development. Gameplay Gears of War is a third-person shooter that places emphasis on using cover to avoid taking damage while moving towards enemy forces. The game uses a number of weapons, but predominately featured is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted chainsaw bayonet that can deal melee damage at close range. Playable characters can carry two primary weapons, grenades, and a smaller, secondary weapon such as the Snub Pistol. Weapons are reloaded with a tap of the RB button, and a second tap within a given time (active reload) rewards the player with a damage bonus. However, failing to perform the \\"Active Reload\\" correctly will cause the gun to become momentarily jammed while the player's character fixes it. When the player takes damage, the \\"Crimson Omen\\", a red cog representing the player's health gauge, will fade into the screen, becoming more defined with larger amounts of damage. The player can seek cover to recover their health, but if they take too much damage, they will become incapacitated. Once this occurs, a skull will fill the center void of the omen. The player can then be revived by a teammate, executed by an enemy, or remain incapacitated until they \\"bleed out\\", dying from blood loss. The game features a five-act campaign that can be played alone or cooperatively with another player. The campaign focuses on COG Army soldiers Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago and their efforts in the Delta Squad to wipe out the Locust forces on their planet Sera. The player is joined by AI teammates that will help fight the Locust. Certain sections of the campaign feature two paths that can be taken as selected by the first player. If there is a second player, their character will automatically take the other. The campaign can be played at three difficulty settings in the first game. From easiest to hardest, these are \\"Casual\\", \\"Hardcore\\" and \\"Insane\\". The \\"Insane\\" difficulty is unlocked once the game is beaten on either the \\"Casual\\" or \\"Hardcore\\" difficulty. Multiplayer Gears of War features up to four-on-four competitive gameplay, with teams representing the Gears or the Locust. Players must execute downed foes, otherwise these will revive after a time. In Assassination matches, the team's leader is the only one that can track the other team's leader and pick up new weapons, after which teammates can pick them up, with the goal to eliminate the foe's leader. An Xbox 360 patch added the \\"Annex\\" mode, which is similar to King of the Hill, in which players must try to control a shifting control point for a certain amount of time to win. The PC version of Gears introduced \\"King of the Hill\\", a mode not present in the Xbox 360 version, which uses a fixed control point but varies the conditions on which it is controlled. Synopsis=Setting and characters Gears of War takes place on the planet Sera. A liquid called Imulsion became a highly valued power source after a scientist discovered how to use it, and the economic shockwave led to several wars between nations. The Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) originally existed only as an obscure world-government philosophy, but it evolved into a legitimate, though minor, political party during the 79-year-long Pendulum Wars. The soldiers of the COG are called \\"Gears\\". After \\"Emergence Day\\" (E-Day), when the Locust began their attack on humanity, the COG were the ones who took the necessary steps to ensure the survival of human civilization, instituting martial law and taking charge of the effort against the Locust. Fourteen years later, the COG is the only human government left on Sera. One year after E-Day, after losing battle after battle against the Locust, the COG made the greatest sacrifice using the Hammer of Dawn on human cities, giving the citizens of Sera three days to evacuate to the Jacinto Plateau, the only place Locust could not dig through, before going through with the attack. The game primarily focuses on Marcus Fenix, the main character, and Delta Squad, consisting of Dominic \\"Dom\\" Santiago, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird. Side characters, such as Private Anthony Carmine, and Lieutenant Minh Young Kim, Lieutenant Anya Stroud, and an elderly Stranded man known as Chaps, also aid Delta Squad throughout the narrative. Players take control of Fenix in the campaign; while in co-op mode, the second player controls Santiago. All four Delta squad members are available for play during multiplayer games, along with Carmine, Kim, and Colonel Victor Hoffman, in addition to the various Locust characters. Marcus Fenix is voiced by John DiMaggio; Dominic Santiago is voiced by Carlos Ferro; and Augustus \\"Cole Train\\" Cole is voiced by Lester \\"The Mighty Rasta\\" Speight. Plot The game's plot begins fourteen years after Emergence Day (E-Day), when the Locust Horde overran and killed many COG soldiers and civilians, declaring war against humanity. Marcus Fenix, a former COG soldier, is reinstated into the military after spending four years in prison for abandoning his military post in order to make a vain attempt to save his father, Adam Fenix. Dominic \\"Dom\\" Santiago, Marcus' best friend and fellow COG, successfully extracts Fenix from the prison, and takes him to meet Delta Squad. The group seeks to obtain the \\"resonator\\", a device that will map \\"The Hollow\\", the caverns which the Locust inhabit and later deploy the \\"Lightmass Bomb\\", which will destroy the heart of the Locust forces inside the Hollow. Fenix and his allies recover the device, but suffer multiple casualties in the process including Anthony Carmine and Squad leader Kim. Fleeing RAAM's forces, Fenix leads the remaining soldiers through the ruins of Ephyra to claim a \\"Junker\\" APC, drive to a mining facility, and finally into the planet's depths. Delta Squad successfully detonates the resonator, but the device fails to map enough of the tunnel network. They discover a larger map of the network that originates from Fenix's old home, specifically his father's laboratory. The group ventures to the Fenix estate at East Barricade Academy, where Fenix originally attempted to rescue his father. When they arrive, Delta encounters heavy Locust resistance. After collecting the data, the group fights their way past Locust forces and boards a train carrying the Lightmass Bomb. Fenix and Santiago battle their way through the train, and are able to defeat General RAAM, before uploading the data. Fully activated, the Lightmass Bomb launches into the Hollow, and eradicates the Locust tunnel networks. In the game's final sequence, Hoffman delivers a victory speech as the tunnels collapse and explode, whereupon the voice of the Locust Queen promises that the Locust will continue to fight onward, despite their losses. Development=Design The first concept for the game was conceived around the years 2000 and 2001 as Unreal Warfare, which was much closer to the multiplayer-driven Unreal series than the game that would eventually become Gears of War. The original concept for the game featured character classes and mechs, being played in a closed arena against other players or bots. The game was put on standby as Epic focused on the Unreal Tournament series, and when the team went back to it, the industry had shifted towards single-player games and the aim of the game was changed. Cliff Bleszinski served as lead designer on Gears of War According to Rod Fergusson, the game was at one point intended to be a horror game influenced by Band of Brothers, Resident Evil 4 and Kill Switch. A romance subplot was considered for the game but was eventually dropped. In an interview with Cliff Bleszinski, lead developer for Epic Games, he cites three games that were the primary influences in the game's design, including the pacing and over-the-shoulder third-person perspective from Resident Evil 4 and the tactical-cover system from Kill Switch; Bleszinski also cited Bionic Commandos influence on the cover system, equating the actions of moving from cover to cover as similar to the action of swinging from platform to platform in the latter game. These design choices reflect themselves in the gameplay, as Gears of War focuses mainly on squad team-based and cover-dependent tactics with limited weapons rather than brute force. Bleszinski also cited the influence of The Legend of Zelda, including its storytelling and world- building elements, acquiring and mastering of tools, and underground environments.http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legacy-of- zelda/1100-6434921/ The game's title itself is a homage to Metal Gear, an early formative influence on Bleszinski. The total cost of development was $10 million, according to Epic's Mark Rein, and 20 to 30 people were involved with the development at any time. However, these figures do not include the proprietary Unreal Engine 3. Gears of War was first shown as an unnamed exclusive for the Xbox 360 in a behind-closed-doors presentation by Epic Games at the 2005 Game Developers Conference. The demo was presented as a technology showcase for Unreal Engine 3 that would run on the Xenon processor at the center of the new Xbox. It showcased a group of human soldiers patrolling a city at night that fell under ambush. The demo was noted for its overall realism, suspense, and visual clarity, helping to reinforce the argument advanced by Epic Games' founder Tim Sweeney for Microsoft to double the memory in the Xbox 360 from the planned 256 MB to 512 MB. This decision that would ultimately cost Microsoft tens of millions of dollars and restrict the number of Xbox 360 consoles available at launch, but allowed Gears of War and many other Xbox 360 games to run at 720p resolution. Gears of War lead designer Cliff Bleszinski said he hoped for the game to expand into graphic novels and eventually film. On November 21, 2006, Microsoft Corporate VP of Global Marketing and Interactive Entertainment Business Jeff Bell stated Gears of War is the first in a trilogy, through sequences on E-Day and the battle of Jacinto Plateau, as well as information on Adam Fenix and his research. Epic Games Vice President Mark Rein posted a message on the official Gears of War Internet forums, stating \\"It's not over until it is not fun anymore\\", and, in his view, Gears of War may become the next Halo series in terms of popularity. The ending to Gears of War heavily suggested a sequel, and at the 2007 Game Developers Conference, Bleszinkski confirmed that Epic Games did \\"intend to do a sequel\\" to Gears of War. The game's sequel, Gears of War 2 was officially confirmed on February 20, 2008, and was released at midnight on November 7, 2008. On January 27, 2014 Microsoft announced that they have acquired all rights to the franchise from Epic Games and that Rod Fergusson had rejoined Microsoft Studios to lead development on future Gears of War games. Ports News of the franchise's future has emerged multiple times since the game's release. PC Gamer accidentally released an image in its 2006 holiday issue where Gears of War can be seen in a Games for Windows display, which led to suspicion that Gears of War would be released for the PC; however, the image was later stated to be a mock-up. Possible leaked pictures were released on February 13, 2007, leading to more suspicion of Gears on the PC. In an interview with Xbox fan site TeamXbox, Mark Rein stated that the game would eventually come to the PC; Epic was not currently ready to release it on that format, but the upcoming release of Unreal Tournament 3 was \\"helping (Epic) get optimization on the PC\\". On July 11, 2007 at the E3 conference, it was revealed that Gears of War would indeed be released for Windows. New features include three new multi-player maps, an extension of five new single-player chapters to act five which describes events of Delta Squad escaping a giant Brumak between acts four and five (which Mark Rein claims is \\"about 20 percent extra\\" over the existing Xbox 360 content), new game modes, a game editor, and Games for Windows ‚Äì Live support integrated into Unreal Engine 3. When asked about bringing the additional content to the Xbox 360 version, Mark Rein of Epic Games stated that \\"it is unlikely we will bring that content to 360\\". He then states, \\"Unfortunately the version it's built on is not really compatible with the 360 and so it would involve a massive patch, a patch larger than all five we've done so far, to Gears of War to do that.\\" Additionally, the PC and Xbox 360 versions will not allow for cross-platform play; Cliff Bleszinski stated that \\"while this feature does add value, it just wasn't that desired nor worth the extra months of design and development time. We want Gears of War to be out this holiday on PC.\\" This news angered many owners of Gears of War on the Xbox 360 due to the game no longer living up to its \\"Exclusively for the Xbox 360\\" title and not receiving the additional content. Mark Rein noted that despite their original label of the game as an Xbox 360 exclusive, Microsoft allowed them to develop the game as part of the Games for Windows moniker, as has been done previously with Halo 2. A patch was released on November 28 to fix performance issues and also the Games for Windows ‚Äì Live update issue. The patch was only released for American and Western European versions of the game; legitimate purchasers of the Eastern European and Russian versions were informed that \\"the game would continue to function without the patch\\" and never issued a corresponding version. A macOS version was confirmed by Mark Rein at the end of E3, on the Game Head television program on July 14, 2007, along with Unreal Tournament 3, but no release time frame was specified. As of August 2014, nothing more has been mentioned. =Digital certificate issue= In early 2009, an issue with a digital certificate, used to sign certain game-critical files as part of the anti-cheat mechanism, which expired on January 28, 2009, rendered the game unplayable without a temporary workaround of resetting the system clock to before the certificate expired. Initial information from sources led people to believe the issue was related to DRM within the game. Epic later acknowledged the problem, claiming it was not in relation to a form of DRM but instead to a form of Anti-Cheat, and notified end users that they \\"[were] working with Microsoft to get it resolved.\\" This issue was corrected as of February 6, 2009 with a downloadable patch.\\"Gears of War for Windows Update Now Available\\" Music The music was composed by Kevin Riepl who has previously worked with Epic Games on the soundtracks for Unreal Tournament 2004 and Unreal Championship 2: The Liandri Conflict. Riepl began receiving early builds and cinematics about halfway through the development process, closely collaborating with the development team on the influence the music should have on the player and the story. The theme of 'Destroyed Beauty' that had inspired the game's visuals guided the music too, creating mood suited to a beautiful city in ruins and the emotional desperation of its inhabitants. The score includes many mechanical percussive elements, altered samples of explosions, hits and impacts, and electric guitar stingers that punctuate the game's combat encounters. To complete the score these elements were combined with the organic sounds of a live orchestra. The orchestral score was orchestrated and conducted by Corey Status and performed by the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra. The title track was written and performed by thrash metal band Megadeth, with an instrumental version of the song being used for the soundtrack; a revised version with lyrics was featured on the band's 2007 album United Abominations. Megadeth performed the track live as headliners of Gigantour, a twenty-five stop metal tour sponsored by Microsoft as part of the promotion for the game. A soundtrack was released on July 31, 2007 by Sumthing Else Music Works. Marketing=Promotional videos Microsoft produced a thirty-minute documentary, titled Gears of War: The Race to E3, that aired on MTV2 on May 19, 2006 to promote the game. The program was produced in a reality TV style and featured Cliff Bleszinski, Epic Games president Mike Capps, and producer Rod Fergusson in the weeks leading up to the Gears of War gameplay reveal at the Xbox Media Briefing at E3 2006. The program captures several stressful moments including Xbox executive Peter Moore's desire to remove the chainsaw rifle from the E3 demo days before the show. The chainsaw remained and after the demo was given Bill Gates confided to Cliff \\"I love that chainsaw.\\" The \\"Mad World\\" spot used the game's textures and models, demonstrated the fidelity of the game's graphics. The Gears of War television ad reveals Marcus Fenix alone in the ruined streets of Sera as he moves to avoid threats that appear throughout a dark and deserted city. The spot was widely praised and has been described as one of the most iconic game trailers of the last decade. The spot, set to the Gary Jules' cover of \\"Mad World\\" and directed by Joseph Kosinski, is melancholy and reflective in tone and was a significant departure for videogame advertising at the time, especially a fast-paced shooter game. Visual effects company Digital Domain created the visuals inside the Unreal Engine 3 game engine, the same engine that powered Gears of War on the Xbox 360. While the spot was pre-rendered, the production method gave consumers an accurate preview of the game's textures and subtle facial expressions. The popularity of the commercial built a bigger audience for \\"Mad World\\" which would reach the #1 spot on iTunes five years after it was initially recorded. The melody remains heavily associated with the Gears of War franchise and was later adopted into the soundtrack of Gears of War 3. Limited Collector's Edition At the game's release, Epic Games released a Limited Collectors Edition. Some of the notable differences are a steel case instead of the regular plastic case and an extra disc which contains artworks of environments and stages including Locust that did not made it to the game, and extra content and behind footage of the making of Gears of War. The disc also contains a time-lapse on the creation of the \\"Emergence\\" mural. The game's disc and case has a different cover and instead features the Omen background. Another of the Collector's Edition extras is a book titled Destroyed Beauty which illustrates the game's back-story and includes concepts, sketches, and descriptions of the game's characters. The Collector's Edition also includes the same instruction manual and 48-hour Xbox Live Gold trial as the regular game does. Downloadable content Epic Games began working on new content for Gears of War in August 2006. The updates would remain free according to Epic Games president Mike Capps. The first of these updates was released over Xbox Live on January 9, 2007, with two new maps released the following day on January 10, 2007. The two maps reflected background scenes from the game's storyline, known as Raven Down and Old Bones, which depict Gears fighting Locust amidst the crash site of a King Raven chopper and a museum. Another update was released for Gears of War on January 22, 2007, which, according to Epic Games' Marc Rein, is said to fix some compatibility issues with the release of Gears of War in Japan, and that no game play or functionality features were changed. On April 9, 2007, Epic Games released their third update, containing a new game mode titled Annex, which requires teams to capture and hold certain areas of each map, as well as additional gameplay tweaks and fixing up some glitches, bugs and exploits. The update was free of charge. Epic Games initially said that four new maps would be released in conjunction with the third patch. However, due to disagreements between Microsoft and Epic Games, Epic decided instead to \\"put these maps on sale at a reasonable price then make them free a few months later,\\" according to Mark Rein of Epic Games. The map pack, titled \\"Hidden Fronts\\", was released on Xbox Live Marketplace on May 3, 2007, and included the maps Bullet Marsh, Garden, Process, and Subway. Free downloads of these maps were made available on September 3, 2007, four months after their initial release. A fourth update on June 14, 2007 added 250 additional Achievement points (bringing the total possible achievement points to 1250), in eight Achievements related to Annex mode and the maps from Hidden Fronts. Additionally, the update includes improvement of roadie run to keep the player from sticking to cover areas, and a patch to prevent the Annex clock from counting during connection errors. Other \\"housekeeping\\" issues were also addressed. Reception=Critical reception Upon its release, Gears of War received universal acclaim from critics, maintaining an average review score of 93.97% at GameRankings and 94/100 at Metacritic. It was the second highest rated game of 2006 on both sites. Metacritic erroneously lists the 2007 version of Out of the Park Baseball as its highest rated game of the year, conflating it with its 2006 counterpart. This is also assuming that both iterations of The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess are taken together as a single game. Most reviewers praised the game for its concept visuals, presentation and sound. IGN's review of the game called it \\"the most gorgeous looking game on the Xbox 360\\" and that \\"the sound design is worthy of awards.\\" While the game received high praise, reviewers did point out that Gears of War did not offer anything significantly new in its core gameplay. Eurogamer's review of the game states: \\"let's not pretend that we're wallowing in the future of entertainment. What we have here is an extremely competent action game that's as polished and refined as it could be, and is therefore very enjoyable. But if Epic had applied the same widescreen scope and ambition to the gameplay as it did to the engine we'd be much more excited than we are.\\" The game's story was noted for not being very deep, as GameSpot's review states \\"The lack of exposition feels like a missed opportunity to make the characters and the setting even more compelling.\\" The PC release of the game received similar praise as the 360 version, with reviewers noting various differences between the two versions. IGN commented that \\"The mouse and keyboard allow for more precise control, and the graphics have been improved as well;\\" however, 1UP stated that \\"the control scheme's a very central obstacle\\" to the game. GameSpot noted that the additional chapter felt out of place as \\"it changes things up a bit in ways that betray the difficulty progression of the game.\\" Hypers Cam Shea commends the game for its \\"visual, solid gameplay, killer multiplayer and reload mechanics\\". However, he criticised it for \\"potential frustration, pointless squad commands and chainsaw mechanics\\". The Lancer weapon was later featured in an Electronic Gaming Monthly article that discusses its practicality and historical precedents. Keirsey criticized this weapon by noting that in real life, \\"chainsaws are heavy.\\" He noted that the closest historical precedents are \\"medieval bludgeoning weapons\\".Evan Samoon, \\"Gun Show: A real military expert takes aim at videogame weaponry to reveal the good, the bad, and the just plain silly,\\" Electronic Gaming Monthly 230 (July 2008): 48. Awards Leading up to the game's release, Gears of War was one of the most anticipated games of 2006. The game premiered during the 2005 E3 show, and won, among others, several \\"Best 360 Game\\" awards, including from IGN, 1UP, and GameSpy. The game continued to win several awards at following 2006 E3 show prior to the game's release. These included the Game Critics Awards for \\"Best Console Game\\" and \\"Best Action Game\\", IGN's \\"Best 360 Action Game\\", \\"Best 360 Multiplayer Game\\", and \\"Best Overall Multiplayer Experience\\", and GameSpy's \\"Best Console Multiplayer\\", \\"Best Action Game\\", and \\"Xbox 360 Game of Show\\". Upon release, Gears of War received numerous awards from many publications. IGN named Gears of War as the \\"Xbox 360 Game of the Year\\" among other awards. GameSpot named the game its \\"Game of the Year\\" as well as \\"Best Xbox 360 Game\\", among other accolades. Official Xbox Magazine named Gears of War as their \\"Xbox 360 Game of the Year\\". G4 TV during the 2007 G-Phoria awards, named Gears of War its \\"Game of the Year\\" in addition to other awards. Gears of War won several awards at the 2007 Interactive Achievement Awards at the D.I.C.E. Summit, including \\"Overall Game of the Year\\", \\"Console Game of the Year\\", and \\"Action/Adventure Game of the Year\\", and \\"Outstanding Achievements\\" in Animation, Art Direction, Visual Engineering, and Online Gameplay. The game received the awards of \\"Ultimate Game of the Year\\" and \\"Xbox Game of the Year\\" at the 2007 Golden Joystick Awards. In addition, the characters within the game received additional awards. GameSpot gave their 2006 \\"Best New Character(s)\\" award to the Delta Squad of Gears of War. G4 TV named Marcus Fenix the \\"Best New Character\\" and gave Lester Speight's performance for \\"Augustus 'Cole Train' Cole\\" the award for \\"Best Voiceover\\". The game was given the Interactive Achievement Award for \\"Outstanding Character Performance ‚Äì Male\\" for its voicework. The Berserkers were named as Official Xbox Magazines \\"Enemy of the Year\\". Guinness World Records awarded Gears of War with 5 world records in the Guinness World Records: Gamer's Edition 2008. These records include, \\"First Console Game to Use the Unreal 3 Engine\\", \\"Fastest Selling Original Xbox 360 Game\\", and \\"First Music Single to Top the Chart After Promoting a Video Game\\" for the Gary Jules version of \\"Mad World\\", which was originally released in 2003, but topped the download charts in November 2006 after it was used as background music during the TV commercial for Gears of War. Sales Gears of War was a hit upon its release. On November 7, 2006‚Äîthe day that it was released‚Äîit became the most popular game on the Xbox Live service, until the release of Halo 3, overtaking Halo 2 which had held the spot since its launch in November 2004. Gears was the second most-played game on the Xbox Live service throughout 2007. Gears of War sold one million copies in its first two weeks on sale making it the fastest-selling Xbox 360 game to date. By January 19, 2007, just ten weeks after its debut, over three million units of the game had been sold. It received a \\"Double Platinum\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 600,000 copies in the United Kingdom. As of November 7, 2008, the game has sold 5.88 million copies worldwide. Gears of War was also the first Xbox or Xbox 360 game to sell out and reach the top ten charts in Japan. Ultimate Edition Promotional poster for Ultimate Edition featuring the main protagonists Leaked in April 2015, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was confirmed in E3 2015 Microsoft's press conference. It was released worldwide for the Xbox One in North America and Asian-Pacific countries on August 25, 2015, and in Europe on August 28. Ultimate Edition is a remaster of the original game, that features the five chapters of the campaign originally exclusive to the PC version of the game. Players who purchased the Ultimate Edition received early access to the multiplayer beta of Gears of War 4, which was released on April 18, 2016. The re-mastered game was subsequently released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016. Development Gears of War Ultimate Edition was developed under the direction of series Rod Fergusson but is the first to be created at The Coalition, the Microsoft Studios studio charged with the continuation and development of the franchise following its acquisition by Microsoft from Epic Games in early 2014. The remake took a total of 18 months, including pre- production, and included the remastering of over 3,000 art assets, original motion capture, and refinement of the control scheme. Only selected elements from the original were retained including the original score and voice performances. The remake's ending was also changed to show Myrrah, the Locust Queen. Display problems The initial release of Gears of War Ultimate Edition suffered from significant display problems and stuttering on contemporary top-end hardware, leading to significant criticism of the developer and Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform. The problems partially related to the developer's transition of the game to DirectX 12 and the implementation of ambient occlusion. Driver updates and a patch from the studio significantly helped to address the issues. On Xbox One X, when video resolution is set to 4K UHD, Gears of War Ultimate Edition suffers from brightness, color, and sharpness fluctuations. These fluctuations can be distracting to the player and significantly detract from the experience. As of January 2020, Microsoft has not issued a patch to address this issue. The only known workaround is to manually set the Xbox One X video resolution to 1080p when playing the game. Reception Gears of War: Ultimate Edition received generally positive reviews from critics. The improved graphics, sound & minimum changes from the original game were heavily praised, but was criticized for its AI problems & the dated campaign level design. Aggregate review website Metacritic assigned a score of 82/100 based on 74 reviews. GameSpot also gave the game a score of 7.0 out of 10 due to the fact that there wasn't major changes to the game other than graphics. IGN also gave the game a score 8.5 out of 10. Jeff Gerstmann from Giant Bomb, who reviewed the original game when he was at GameSpot, gave the title a negative review. He criticized the game's AI and the campaign mode, noting that it \\"aged pretty poorly\\". Film adaptation In March 2007, New Line Cinema bought the rights to make a film adaptation, with Stuart Beattie writing the script along with Marty Bowen and Wyck Godfrey. In June 2008, Len Wiseman was confirmed to direct before dropping out in 2010. Since then, New Line have been looking for a new director and have allegedly lowered the budget.

The AL-7 uses a type of operation developed by Pyotr Tkachyov of TsNIITochMash (Central Institute for Precision Machine Building) in the mid-1960s known as Balanced Automatics first used on the AO-38 assault rifle. The Balanced Automatics Recoil System (BARS) replaces the traditional Kalashnikov gas piston operating system, reducing the negative effects of recoil and allowing more efficient use of automatic fire. BARS works by shifting mass toward the muzzle of the rifle as the bolt and bolt carrier recoil rearward. The AL-7 and its BARS system were never adopted by the Soviet Army. The project was overshadowed by the acceptance of the AK-74 due to cost considerations. The passage of time has allowed manufacturing technology to advance, finally making the AL-7 concept economically viable, presenting itself in the form of the AK-107 and AK-108 rifles. Other rifles that use the balanced automatics system are the AEK-971, AO-38, SA-006, AKB and AKB-1.

After securing Shaykh Hasan's neutrality, Musa's patron Ali Padshah went on to battle Arpa Ke'un on Jaghatu plains near Maragha on 29 April 1336. Arpa's army were led by 60 emirs, notably Hajji Taghay (son of Sutai, Governor of Diyar Bakr, from Oirats), Uyghur commander √ñgr√ºnch, Torut (a son of Nari and relative of Narin Taghay), Ortuq-Shah (son of Alghu) and Chupan's son Sorgan Sira. However, soon some emirs defected to the side of Ali Padshah, such as Mahmud b. Essen Qutlugh and Sultanshah Nikruz. Battle was a defeat for Arpa and soon after he was captured in Sultaniya and killed. Subsequently, Musa was enthroned as new Ilkhan, in fact as a puppet of Ali Padshah. Supporters of Arpa Ke'un, namely Hajji Taghai meanwhile went to Jalayirid Hasan Buzurg, who in turn raised another Borjigid prince, Pir Husain as an Ilkhan on 20 July 1336. Chupanid Sorgan Sira again changed sides and joined Jalayirids at the battle of Qara Darra near Van. A Georgian contingent under Amirgambar I Panaskerteli, Duke of Tao also joined the battle on Jalayirid side. Despite Ali Padshah's contingents defeating Hajji Taghay and √ñgr√ºnch defeating Surghan, Musa was standing on center and badly defeated. As a consequence, battle was lost and Ali Padshah was captured and executed while Musa was forced to flee on July 24, 1336. Despite losing his patron, Musa didn't relinquish his claim to Ilkhanate and retreated to Baghdad, later joining forces with Togha Tem√ºr in June 1337 occupied Soltaniyeh. However, he was soon captured by Emir Qara Hasan and killed on 10 July 1337.

All voluntary movement relies on spinal lower motor neurons, which innervate skeletal muscle fibers and act as a link between upper motor neurons and muscles. Cranial nerve lower motor neurons control movements of the eyes, face and tongue, and contribute to chewing, swallowing and vocalization. Damage to the lower motor neurons can lead to flaccid paralysis, absent deep tendon reflexes and muscle atrophy. Classification Lower motor neurons are classified based on the type of muscle fiber they innervate: * Alpha motor neurons (Œ±-MNs) innervate extrafusal muscle fibers, the most numerous type of muscle fiber and the one involved in muscle contraction. * Beta motor neurons (Œ≤-MNs) innervate intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles with collaterals to extrafusal fibers (type of slow twitch fibers). * Gamma motor neurons (Œ≥-MNs) innervate intrafusal muscle fibers, which together with sensory afferents compose muscle spindles. These are part of the system for sensing body position (proprioception). Physiology Glutamate released from the upper motor neurons triggers depolarization in the lower motor neurons in the anterior grey column, which in turn causes an action potential to propagate the length of the axon to the neuromuscular junction where acetylcholine is released to carry the signal across the synaptic cleft to the postsynaptic receptors of the muscle cell membrane, signaling the muscle to contract. Clinical significance Damage to lower motor neurons, lower motor neuron lesions (LMNL) cause muscle wasting (atrophy), decreased strength and decreased reflexes in affected areas. These findings are in contrast to findings in upper motor neuron lesions. LMNL is indicated by abnormal EMG potentials, fasciculations, paralysis, weakening of muscles, and neurogenic atrophy of skeletal muscle. Bell's Palsy, Bulbar palsy, Poliomyelitis and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are all pathologies associated with lower motor neuron dysfunction.

Females, or gilts, are used as well. Boars (full-grown intact males) and sows generally are too large. Many Southern families have a pig roast for Thanksgiving or Christmas, graduations, weddings, or summer gatherings. Some communities hold cook-offs during festivals, where cooks compete against one another for prize money.Newport, NC Pig Cooking Contest Q and A Cooking A pig, often around 80‚Äì120 pounds dressed weight, is split in half and spread onto a large charcoal or propane grill. Some practitioners use a separate stove filled with hardwood to produce coals which are then transferred under the charcoal grill by shovel; others use charcoal with chunks of either blackjack oak, hickory wood or some other hardwood added for flavor. The style of these grills are as varied as the methods of producing them, some being homemade while others are custom-made. There is a long-running debate among barbecue enthusiasts over the merits of different fuels. Propane is said to maintain a consistent temperature, whereas charcoal or charwood are often touted as producing better-tasting meat.Natural Gas vs Propane vs Charcoal The cooking process is communal and usually directed by an authority figure; the host is helped by friends or family. It usually takes four to eight hours to cook the pig completely;The Best Way to Roast a Pig the pig is often started \\"meat-side\\" down, and then is flipped one time once the hog has stopped dripping rendered fat. Some practitioners clean ashes from the skin with paper towels or a small whisk broom before flipping the hog to help produce high quality cracklings from the skin. Often the hog is basted while cooking, though the method and sauce used differs according to region. For instance, a typical South Carolina Piedmont-area baste would be a mustard based sauce,South Carolina Barbeque Association an Eastern North Carolina baste is usually a very light vinegar based sauce with red pepper flakes,http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2008/10/north-carolina-barbecue- vinegar-sauce.html and Western North Carolina barbecue uses sauce with a ketchup base similar to traditional barbecue sauce.What Is North Carolina- Style BBQ? When the cooking is complete, the meat should ideally be tender to the point of falling off of the bone. The meat is then either chopped or pulled into traditional Carolina-style pork barbecue, or it is picked off the hog itself by the guests. It is from the latter that the gathering gains its name. The barbecue is sometimes eaten with hushpuppies (fried cornmeal, occasionally flavored with onions), coleslaw, baked beans or sometimes Brunswick stew. In South Carolina, it is common to serve pilaf or hash as a side dish. Hash is a blend of leftover pork mixed with barbecue sauce and usually served over rice. Sweet tea, beer, and soft drinks are often served.  Culture  The pig pickin' is a significant part of the culture of the South; the necessary work and time needed to cook the hog makes it ideal for church gatherings (\\"dinner on the grounds\\") or family reunions, and they can be held virtually year-round thanks to the region's mild winters. Pig pickin's are popular amongst the most devoted tailgaters at college football games across the South. The pig pickin' has been long associated with politics; many local political parties and politicians still use the pig pickin' to attract people to meetings and campaign rallies. In 1983, Rufus Edmisten, running for Governor of North Carolina at the time, was overheard saying \\"I've eaten enough barbecue. I am not going to eat any more. I'm taking my stand and that is it.\\" Culturally and culinarily different from traditional Deep South pig pickin' events, pig roasts are a common occurrence in Cuba and the Philippines, as well as the non-mainland American state of Hawaii, with roasts being done in the traditions of those places.

The legal name of this railway was the Halifax & South Western Railway, as is defined in various Acts of the Nova Scotia Legislature, such as 1902 c.1, Act respecting the Halifax & South Western Railway Co.. However, Halifax & Southwestern Railway is also sometimes also used. The H&SW; was created in spring 1901 when William Mackenzie and Donald Mann approached the provincial government with plans to finish the abortive plans for a railway from Halifax to Yarmouth along the province's South Shore. For many years, the line had significant curvature throughout its length, a result of the rugged local topography, which earned it the moniker, \\"Hellish Slow & Wobbly\\". Predecessors The H&SW; was not the first railway to build on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, as various charters for railway companies had preceded it. The Nova Scotia Central Railway (NSCR) had opened its line between Middleton in the Annapolis Valley and Lunenburg, by way of Bridgewater, on December 23, 1889. In 1893, the Coast Railway Company of Nova Scotia was incorporated under a charter to build a narrow gauge line between Yarmouth and Lockeport, by way of Barrington and Shelburne. Construction took place very slowly and what little trackage had been already built was converted to standard gauge in 1895. In 1899 the company was renamed the Halifax and Yarmouth Railway (H&YR;) and received a new charter to build east from Lockeport to Liverpool, Bridgewater and Halifax. By 1903 the line had barely reached Barrington. The Liverpool and Milton Tramway also built a short railway up the Mersey River valley between Liverpool and a pulp mill near Milton in Queens County in 1896, opening on February 1, 1897. It was renamed the Liverpool and Milton Railway (L&MR;) in 1900. Mergers and construction Donald MannSir William Mackenzie The H&SW; was created in spring 1901 when Mackenzie and Mann approached the provincial government with plans to finish the abortive plans for a railway from the City of Halifax to Yarmouth. Experienced railway engineers, MacKenzie and Mann already owned 2,000 miles in track in Canada by this time.Shirley E. Woods, Cinders and Saltwater, Nimbus, 1992. p. 141. On July 1, 1902, the H&SW; purchased the NSCR with its line from Mahone Bay to Bridgewater, forming part of the new mainline between Bridgewater and Halifax. The new construction between Halifax and Mahone Bay was completed by 1904. On April 11, 1903, the H&SW; purchased the Nova Scotia Southern Railway (NSSR). The NSSR had no trackage constructed, however it did have a charter to build from the NSCR at New Germany to Caledonia in what was rich timber territory. Upon acquiring the NSSR charter, the H&SW; built the 22 miles of track over the following months, with the first train reaching Caledonia on July 1, 1904. In April 1905, the H&SW; purchased the L&MR;, with a short section of that line forming part of the main line between Bridgewater and Barrington. The new construction between Bridgewater and Barrington was completed later that year. In 1905, the H&SW; also purchased the H&YR; with major upgrades being done to this line between Barrington and Yarmouth over the next year. Also in 1905, the H&SW; purchased the charter for the incomplete Middleton and Victoria Beach Railway (M&VBR;) in the western Annapolis Valley. The 40 mile M&VBR; line was opened by the H&SW; to connect an iron ore mine at Torbrook, near Middleton on the NSCR, with port facilities at Port Wade on Annapolis Basin. Canadian Northern Rail crossing at Martins River. The bridge is now part of the Trans Canada Trail.Construction was completed in 1906 and H&SW; tracks joined the Intercolonial Railway's mainline in Halifax at Southwestern Junction at Africville and ran into the Intercolonial's North Street Station. On December 19, 1906 the first H&SW; through train reached Yarmouth from Halifax. At some point after the completion of the H&SW; in 1906, the system was merged into Mackenze and Mann's Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) transcontinental system. The H&SW;, along with the Inverness Railway, were isolated from the rest of CNoR's trackage which ran from Montreal to Vancouver, not unlike rival Canadian Pacific Railway's Dominion Atlantic Railway. The CNoR, along with several other railway lines in Canada, entered financial difficulties during the First World War. Encumbered by construction debts and low traffic, the CNoR was bankrupt and requested financial aid from the federal government in 1918. On September 6, 1918, CNoR was nationalized and placed under a Board of Management by the Department of Railways and Canals. On December 20, 1918, CNoR, along with the Canadian Government Railways were placed under a new company named Canadian National Railways (CNR). Canadian National Under CNR, the H&SW; trackage saw significant infrastructure improvements to ballast, drainage, sleeper ties, rails, switches and bridges. The line still had significant curvature throughout, a result of the rugged local topography on the South Shore (locals called the H&SW; the \\"Hellish Slow & Wobbly\\"), but the improvements brought respectable track speeds and service improvements. The Intercolonial Railway / Canadian Government Railways Halifax terminal trackage inherited by CNR underwent significant change in the late 1910s with the construction and opening of a new south-end terminal and station in 1920. The project saw a massive railway cut built across the isthmus of the Halifax Peninsula which affected the H&SW; tracks that connected with the ICR mainline near Africville. In 1921, the Halifax end of the H&SW; was shifted to join the new alignment in the rock cut by constructing what became known as \\"Southwestern Junction\\" in the community of Fairview, adjacent to a large new roundhouse complex. In the years before the domination of publicly funded highways, the H&SW; formed a critical transportation link between the various communities, as well as steam ship connections at Yarmouth (to Boston and New York) and Halifax (to Europe). In the 1920s, the former M&VBR; line was proving uneconomic after the closure of iron ore mines at Torbrook and the port at Port Wade. CNR applied in 1925 to abandon west of Middleton, but permission was given to abandon only west of Bridgetown. By 1928, bridges were removed and trackage would be removed in the following years. The construction of the large Bowater Mersey Paper Company Limited mill at Brooklyn in 1929 led to more traffic from the Liverpool area. Shipyards in Liverpool and Shelburne lent some traffic, as did various saw mills and logging operations at locations between Yarmouth and Halifax and between Bridgewater and Middleton/Bridgetown and New Germany to Caledonia. The naval base HMCS Shelburne opened on Shelburne Harbour during the Second World War, requiring construction of a short 1 mile spur. Heating oil and gasoline distribution terminals operated by various oil companies in communities along the lines. A distillery in Bridgetown generated some traffic, as did a forest products plant in East River. In the early 1980s a large Michelin tire factory opened in Bridgewater and required rail service. The development of the Lakeside Industrial Park near the Beechville area in the 1960s create several large industrial customers. One of them, a Volvo assembly plant attracted steady strings of autorack cars until it closed in 1998.David Othen, Halifax and Southwestern Railway: Views of and from Trains Between Halifax and Bridgewater 1973-2008 (2010) Blurb.com self published, p. 11 Decline CNCanadian National officially became CN in 1960 passenger service ended on the South Shore on Saturday October 25, 1969, and its stations fell into disuse. The historic H&SW; passenger station in Bridgewater was destroyed by an unexplained fire on December 22, 1982. CN's former H&SW; lines on Nova Scotia's South Shore and in the Annapolis Valley were proving uneconomic by the early 1980s, even for freight service. In 1982, permission was given to abandon the far end of the mainline from Liverpool to Yarmouth as well as the branch line of the former NSCR line between Bridgewater and Bridgetown via Middleton, as well as the New Germany to Caledonia. Reduced to a line running from Halifax to Liverpool, CN depended on the Bowater paper mill and the Michelin tire plant, but even these customers were unable to keep the line generating positive income. Halifax, 2010. The track bed is now a multiuse trail. By the late 1980s, CN was given permission to abandon the remaining line from Bridgewater to Liverpool as the Bowater pulp mill in Liverpool shifted its transportation to ocean shipping and trucks. At Bridgewater, CN built a small yard on the east side of the Lahave River and sold its extensive former yard property to a shopping mall developer. In the early 1990s, even that trackage was eliminated, as Michelin began to use trucks to service its plant and CN's last remaining customer in Lunenburg County was the forest products company at East River. In 1993 the former H&SW; trackage was abandoned west of Halifax's Lakeside Industrial Park, leaving only a 7-mile spur as the last reminder of this once important railway network in southern Nova Scotia. Called the Chester Spur in its employee timetable, CN freight operations to the Bayers Lake Industrial Park and Lakeside Industrial Park were focused on serving a cement depot, a scrap dealer and several other customers through a team track. In 2006, as part of its \\"Three-Year Rail Network Plan\\", CN declared its intention to discontinue service on the Chester Spur, this being the last remaining portion of the original H&SW; trackage. The last freight trains operated on the spur west of Southwestern Junction through to the Lakeside Industrial Park in late 2007.Othen, p. 12 The rail corridor was purchased by the Halifax Regional Municipality and by October 2009, rails at level crossings were lifted and paved over\\"Off the Rails\\", Halifax Chronicle Herald, October 7, 2009, p. A7 and by September 2010, all the remaining track of the CN Chester Spur had been removed and replaced by a rail trail (paved recreational pathway). Preservation The railway's history is preserved at the Halifax and Southwestern Railway Museum in Lunenburg, Nova Scotia.Halifax and Southwestern Railway Museum website In addition to the network of recreational trails built on the former H&SW; roadbed, several stations have survived and been given alternative use. They include the French Village station, which is now a cafe and the Liverpool station which is the Hank Snow museum.

It is based on the novel The Hunter by Donald E. Westlake using the pseudonym Richard Stark, which had earlier been adapted into the 1967 film noir classic Point Blank, directed by John Boorman and starring Lee Marvin. In 2006, Helgeland issued a director's cut that differs substantially from the version released by the studio. Plot Face down on the kitchen table of an underground abortionist, barely conscious and with two large bullet wounds in his back, lies career thief and former Marine Porter. The unlicensed doctor uses the whiskey he is drinking as sterilizing agent and digs out the bullets. Porter spends five months recuperating. Porter begins tracking down his estranged wife Lynn and former partner-in-crime Val Resnick. Porter was betrayed by both following a $140,000 heist from local Chinese Triads. Resnick had manipulated Lynn into complicity with a picture showing Porter with another woman. Lynn then shot Porter and the two left him for dead. Val rejoined a criminal syndicate named \\"the Outfit\\", using $130,000 of the heist money to pay off an outstanding debt. Porter is intent on claiming his $70,000 cut, steadily climbing up the criminal hierarchy. He first finds Lynn, now a heroin-addicted prostitute. Taking pity on her disastrous predicament, he confines her to her bedroom, only to discover her dead from a heroin overdose the next day. Lynn's drug delivery guy points Porter towards lowlife drug dealer and gambler named Arthur Stegman. Porter finds Stegman in the company of two corrupt police detectives, Hicks and Leary, who start harassing Porter for a share of his goal. Porter enlists the help of Rosie, a call girl affiliated with the Outfit. He was once her limo driver and eventual lover, and a picture taken during their one-night stand was the one used by Resnick to stoke Lynn's jealousy and facilitate the original betrayal. Rosie tells Porter that Resnick is barred from soliciting Outfit prostitutes because his sadistic tendencies nearly killed one of them, possibly Rosie herself. Resnick is seeing a Triad-connected dominatrix named Pearl when Porter violently re-enters his life. Resnick begs the Outfit for help and explains why Porter demands $70,000, but is told to solve his own problems. He then pins the $140,000 heist solely on Porter in order to have him murdered by Pearl's associates. This attempt fails, and Resnick follows Porter's trail to Rosie's apartment, beats her and recognizes her as a former victim of his extreme sexual deviancy. Porter appears in time to prevent further abuse and shoots Resnick dead, not before obtaining the names of Outfit bosses Fairfax and Carter. He takes Rosie to a secret apartment but finds it rigged with plastic explosives, connected to the telephone by three of Carter's hitmen. Porter kills them and later confronts Carter in his own office, threatening to kill him unless he pays the $70,000. Carter states he is only an underboss, thus unauthorized to make financial decisions. Porter then forces Carter to phone the real boss, named Bronson. When Bronson refuses over the phone, Porter carries out his threat and kills Carter. Porter then frames Hicks and Leary by planting Leary's fingerprints on the gun used to kill Resnick, as well as stealing Hicks's badge and leaving it with the gun in Resnick's hand. With the aid of Rosie, Porter kidnaps Bronson's son Johnny. He then visits and threatens Fairfax; Hicks and Leary, who are waiting outside Fairfax's house, are promptly arrested by Internal Affairs on account of the false evidence left earlier. A shootout ensues involving Porter, Stegman, his driver, Pearl and the Triads; only Porter and Pearl survive. Porter is later captured by Fairfax's men, taken to a warehouse and beaten for hours. Bronson arrives with his own men, shows Porter a bag containing the symbolic $130,000 that he is never meant to have, and supervises a more gruesome torture method to extract his son's location. Porter finally gives an address that turns out to be his own secret apartment. He is locked inside a car trunk and driven by Bronson, Fairfax and their men to the flat which, unbeknownst to them, still contains the unexploded bomb left earlier by Carter's men. Porter then manages to grab the car phone and call his own apartment in time for Bronson to pick the telephone. After his captors meet an explosive demise, Porter goes to pick up Rosie. Leaving Johnny behind, the two take off with the money the mob owed him and drive off to Canada to begin a new life.

Although credited as director, Brian Helgeland's cut of the film was not the theatrical version released to audiences. After the end of principal photography, Helgeland's version was deemed too dark for the mainstream public. Following a script rewrite by Terry Hayes, director Helgeland was replaced by the production designer John Myhre, who reshot 30% of the film. The intent was to make the Porter character accessible. The film's tagline became: \\"Get Ready to Root for the Bad Guy.\\" A potentially controversial scene between Porter and Lynn which arguably involves spousal abuse was excised and more plot elements were added to the third act. After 10 days of reshoots, a new opening scene and voiceover track also were added, and Kris Kristofferson walked on as a new villain. Helgeland's version, Straight Up: The Director's Cut, was released on DVD, Blu-ray, and HD DVD on April 10, 2007, after an October 2006 run at the Austin Film Festival. The Director's Cut version features a female Bronson, that is never seen only heard over the phone voiced by Sally Kellerman, does not include the voice-over by Porter and several Bronson-related scenes. During their scuffle (which is longer than in the theatrical version and was the main source of controversy), Porter earlier tells Lynn that his picture with Rosie was taken before they met, thereby rendering her jealousy unjustified. This version has an entirely different, ambiguous ending where Porter is seriously wounded in a train station shootout and driven off by Rosie. A June 4, 2012, look at \\"movies improved by directors' cuts\\" by The A.V. Club described Payback: Straight Up as \\"a marked improvement on the unrulier original.\\" Editing Mel Gibson stated in a short interview released as a DVD extra that it \\"would've been ideal to shoot in black and white.\\" He noted that \\"people want a color image\\" and that the actual film used a bleach bypass process to tint the film. In addition to this, the production design used muted shades of red, brown, and grey for costumes, sets, and cars for further effect. Reception=Box office Payback was well received at the box office. The film made $21,221,526 in its opening weekend in North America. It eventually grossed $81,526,121 in North America and $80,100,000 in other territories, totaling $161,626,121 worldwide. Critical reception The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 54% based on 74 reviews from critics, and a weighted average of 5.9 out of 10. The website's critical consensus states, \\"Sadistic violence and rote humor saddle a predictable action premise.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B-\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film a three-star rating (out of four) in his review, writing, \\"There is much cleverness and ingenuity in Payback, but Mel Gibson is the key. The movie wouldn't work with an actor who was heavy on his feet, or was too sincere about the material.\\" ReferencesExternal links  * * Category:1999 films Category:1999 action thriller films Category:1999 crime thriller films Category:American films Category:American action thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American gangster films Category:English-language films Category:Films about identity theft Category:American films about revenge Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on crime novels Category:Films based on works by Donald E.

The size of the century changed over time and from the first century B.C.E. throughout most of the empire the standard size of a centuria was 80 men. A centuria is also a Roman unit of land area corresponding to 100 heredia. Roman use=Political In the political context the centuria was the constituent voting unit in the assembly of the centuries (Latin comitia centuriata), an old form of popular assembly in the Roman Republic, the members of which cast one collective vote. Its origin seems to be the homonymous military unit. The comitia centuriata elected important magistrates like consuls and praetors. Military The centuria was the pivotal tactical Roman legion unit after the Marian reforms of 107 BC. It originally consisted of a hundred soldiers; later 80 distributed among 10 contubernia, with support staff making up the remainder of the 100 men. Each contubernium (the minimal unit in the Roman legion) consisted of 8 soldiers who lived in the same tent while on campaign or the same bunk room in barracks. Centuriae were grouped by pairs forming maniples, and later into 6 century cohorts. A century was commanded by a Centurion, who was assisted by an Optio (lieutenant) and Tesserarius (sergeant). It had a banner or signum which was carried by a Signifer. Also, each century provided a Buccinator, who played a buccina, a kind of horn used to transmit acoustic orders. On the battlefield, the Centurion stood at the far right of the first row of men next to the Signifer, while the Optio stood at the rear, to avoid, if necessary, the disbanding of the troops and ensure the relay between typical closed order lines used by the Roman army. In the imperial period, but likely not the republican period, the first cohort (consisting of the bravest men from the legion) was twice the size of the other cohorts. Each of its five centuriae was a double centuria of 160 men (rather than 80). The first cohort thus consisted of 800 men. Centurions of these first-cohort double centuriae were called primi ordinis (\\"first rank\\"), except for the leader of the first centuria of the first cohort, who was referred to as primus pilus (first file).

He was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals in the sixth round of the 1994 NFL Draft. He played college football at Boise State. He also played for the Pittsburgh Steelers, New York Jets, and Philadelphia Eagles. He won the Vince Lombardi Trophy with the Steelers in Super Bowl XL against the Seattle Seahawks. College career Von Oelhoffen graduated from Moloka'i High School which did not have a football team. He played one season of high school football at Moanalua High School, which is located on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, in 1985. Von Oelhoffen started playing at the University of Hawaii, transferring to Walla Walla Community College the next year and finally settling at Boise State University. He suffered a number of injuries in college that slowed his development including a stress fracture in his foot in 1992 and a sprained ankle in 1993.Dave Reardon and B.J. Reyes, Kimo von Steeler, Star Billetin, 2/1/06 Professional career=Cincinnati Bengals The Cincinnati Bengals selected Von Oelhoffen with the first pick of the sixth round of the 1994 NFL Draft. In his first three seasons, he was largely a reserve, moving into the starting lineup in 1997. The next season, Von Oelhoffen became a mainstay of the defensive line, starting every game and finishing second in tackles among defensive linemen. Pittsburgh Steelers After a strong 1999 season, where he recorded 24 tackles and four sacks, he signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers as an unrestricted free agent on a four-year $11 million contract.Pat Bigold, Steelers made Von Oelhoffen an offer he couldn't refuse, Star Bulletin, 2/15/00 Pittsburgh initially inserted him as the starting nose tackle and converted him to defensive end. Von Oelhoffen would start all but one game from the 2000-2005 seasons. He won a Super Bowl ring in 2005 in his final season as a Steeler.Pittsburgh Steelers Player Page, steelers.com, Accessed on 9/2/07 =Carson Palmer's injury= During the 2005 Wildcard Playoff game against the Cincinnati Bengals, his former team, Von Oelhoffen was involved in a controversial hit on Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer that occurred on the Bengals second play from scrimmage, after which it knocked Palmer out of the game with a severe knee injury. Von Oelhoffen, coming off a block set by guard Eric Steinbach, rolled into Palmer's left knee after Palmer released a pass 66 yards down field to wide receiver Chris Henry, who was also injured on the play.Leonard Shapiro, The Steelers Carry On, Washington Post, 1/9/06 The injury to Palmer was severe, including damage to his anterior cruciate ligament, medial collateral ligament, and posterior cruciate ligament. MRI's later determined that Palmers ACL, PCL, and MCL were all torn as a result of the hit. Cincinnati fans booed at him after watching the replays on the jumbotron, thinking that a flag should've been thrown for a late hit or roughing the passer. However, no flag was thrown because the hit was deemed legal at the time. Von Oelhoffen later apologized publicly for the hit rather than contact Palmer directly about the incident. Though Palmer confirmed that von Oelhoffen never contacted him personally to apologize, Palmer stated that the injury was, \\"just part of the game.\\"Von Oelhoffen offers apology after Palmer's injury, ESPN.com, 1/9/06Graham Bensinger, Palmer has lofty expectations for 2006, ESPN.com Weekly Conversation, 1/15/06 During the off- season, the NFL Rules Committee modified the rule regarding low hits on quarterbacks. The so-called \\"Kimo Clause\\" now requires that defenders take every opportunity to avoid hitting a quarterback at or below the knees when the quarterback is in a defenseless position looking to throw with both feet on the ground. New York Jets For the 2006 season, Von Oelhoffen signed with the New York Jets on a three-year $9.2 million deal. He spent one season with the Jets, viewed somewhat as a disappointment given his $3.2 million signing bonus.Dave hitchinson, Wadsworth Likely a Cut, Star Ledger, 9/1/07 Philadelphia Eagles After being released by the Jets in training camp, Von Oelhoffen signed a one-year deal with the Philadelphia Eagles. He would appear in eight games for them during that season. He was later released by the team. He has since retired from professional football.

It is the longest north-south Autoroute, beginning as the continuation of I-91 at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border near Stanstead and continuing to Shawinigan, where it downgrades to Route 155. The total length of A-55 is currently long, including concurrencies with Autoroute 10, Autoroute 20 and Autoroute 40. Route description Autoroute 55 connects the mid-sized communities of Sherbrooke, Drummondville, Trois-Rivi√®res, and Shawinigan and the smaller communities in between. The most notable feature on A-55 is the Laviolette Bridge between Trois-Rivi√®res and B√©cancour, which is one of the longest bridges in Quebec and in Canada. A-55 had a short \\"gap\\" between B√©cancour and Drummondville until October 2006. The gap resulted from Transports Quebec's original intention of bringing A-55 southeast towards Victoriaville along what is now Autoroute 955 before shifting southwest to rejoin existing A-55 near Richmond. However, plans changed in the 1970s, and the present routing was chosen. The southern section was originally supposed to be Autoroute 51 and was intended to continue to the planned extension of Autoroute 30 in Pierreville. A-55 was signed along Route 155 (which is not an Autoroute- standard highway) until the new route was completed. All of the southern portion of A-55 became a full four-lane freeway by the end of October 2006. The gap being filled in the northern portion will initially be a two-lane freeway for about , but it is intended to ultimately be four lanes. The designation Autoroute Joseph-Armand Bombardier is in honour of Quebec businessman Joseph-Armand Bombardier, who lived in Valcourt, near where A-55 passes and who invented the snowmobile there. His company, Bombardier Inc., started by building snowmobiles and eventually grew into a major international manufacturer of transit vehicles and aircraft. The designation Autoroute de l'√ânergie means \\"Energy Highway\\" since it provides access to the Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station in B√©cancour and the hydroelectric facilities in Shawinigan and the Haut-Saint-Maurice area, but the section north of A-30 is likely to remain at its comparatively short length to Shawinigan for the foreseeable future.

Background Joseph Milton Bernstein was born on September 30, 1908, in Connecticut. He attended Yale University, where he joined the John Reed Club. Career Bernstein allegedly recruited T.A. Bisson, who had stopped working at the Board of Economic Warfare (BEW) and began working in the Institute of Pacific Relations (IPR) and in the editorial offices of Bernstein‚Äôs periodical Amerasia. Bisson passed to Bernstein copies of four documents: (a) his own report for BEW with his views on working out a plan for shipment of American troops to China; (b) a report by the Chinese embassy in Washington to its government in China; (c) a brief BEW report of April 1943 on a general evaluation of the forces of the sides on the Soviet-German front; and (d) a report by the American consul in Vladivostok. Bernstein is supposed to have functioned as the contact between Soviet Military Intelligence (GRU) and Philip Keeney of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and his wife, Mary Jane Keeney of the Board of Economic Warfare and later the United Nations. In 1945 the Office of Strategic Services Security Division and the FBI searched the offices of the magazine Amerasia, which was suspected of holding classified government documents. The staff of the publication included accused Communist spies and agents, including Joseph Bernstein. In subsequent years, the case resulted in several convictions and a number of congressional hearings were held on the case. Bernstein's code with the GRU and in the Venona project is \\"MARQUIS\\".

It was the alternate capital of the Chu state in the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period. Because the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521‚Äì1566) of the Ming dynasty was born and had lived in the city before he succeeded to the throne, Zhongxiang, the place where the Chengtian Prefecture (fu) Government Office was located, became one of the three major prefectures directly under the central government. Once on the throne, the Jiajing Emperor controversially had his dead father Zhu Youyuan (1476‚Äì1519) retroactively styled as the Gongruixian Emperor; his mother became the Zhangsheng empress dowager. They were buried at a sumptuous mausoleum, knowns as the Xianling Tomb, a few kilometers northeast of Zhongxiang.Eric N.

Career In 1974, Richard Tucholka, a computer technician in Michigan, collaborated with Robert Sadler on a number of pieces of fiction. One of their stories was a post-apocalyptic adventure story called The Morrow Project, about people who awake from cryogenic sleep 150 years after a nuclear holocaust. After completing two chapters, the two left the story in hiatus. The following year, Tucholka was introduced to the Dungeons & Dragons role- playing game (RPG), and he quickly realized that The Morrow Project could become an RPG. Using the story's setting as source material, Tucholka created the game background, and he and Sadler approached Kevin Dockery to add military realism to the game. After playtesting it at a local Michigan games convention, Tucholka, Sadler and Dockery formed Timeline Ltd. in 1979 to publish the new RPG. Almost immediately, Tucholka and Sadler left Timeline due to creative differences with Dockery and formed their own games company, Tacky Tack Games, based in Pontiac, Michigan. Their first product was the light- hearted microgame Geriatric War, a fast-paced game where \\"characters battle over a few pension checks that survive the Social Security collapse of 2018\\". Tucholka then created and published more serious RPGs such as Fringeworthy, the first RPG about dimensional travel, Bureau 13, the first horror RPG, and FTL: 2448, a space opera RPG. Given the more serious tone of these works, the company name was changed from Tacky Tack Games to the more professional- sounding Tri Tac Games in 1983. Tucholka continued to create new games for Tri Tac, including Bureau 13, Hardwired Hinterland, Monster Squash, Pterroductyl, The Viral Vegetable Wars, Drive By, War on High, Escape From Westerville State, Baby Boomer, Duck Trooper, Beach Bunny Bimbos with Blasters and HOLES. He also created supplements and adventure scenarios for other games, including Invasion U.S., Cloistrs, Rogue 417, Weirdzone, Hellsnight, Haunts, Starcharts, and the DM's Book Of Nasty Tricks & Misfit Magic. Tochulka was also a staff writer for Stardate and Stardrive small press magazines, and was the guest of honor at more than a dozen science fiction and games conventions. Personal life Tucholka's hobbies included gardening, house restoration, reading, and B movies. He was a fan of science fiction, and his personal collection of SF novels numbered over 18,000. He died of cancer in 2017. Awards Tucholka's creation Bureau 13: Stalking the Night Fantastic was voted Best Fantasy RPG of 1991 by the RPGA Network at Gen Con 1992.

This is the condition after rebuilding, with the cylinders lowered from their original position An 0-2-2, in the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, is one that has two coupled driving wheels followed by two trailing wheels, with no leading wheels. The configuration was briefly built by Robert Stephenson and Company for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway Equivalent classifications Other equivalent classifications are: *UIC classification: A1 (also known as German classification and Italian classification) *French classification: 011 *Turkish classification: 12 *Swiss classification: 1/2  Liverpool & Manchester Railway  Northumbrian as depicted in the October 16, 1830 issue of Mechanics' Magazine.  Rocket  The 0-2-2 or Northumbrian wheel arrangement was first used for Stephenson's Rocket, their entry for the Rainhill Trials of 1829, a competition to choose a locomotive design for the new Liverpool & Manchester Railway. Stephenson recognised that the rules of the competition favoured a fast, light locomotive of only moderate hauling power. Although George Stephenson's previous designs had been heavy four-coupled freight locomotives, Rocket was almost entirely new. Stephenson was an advocate of the adhesion railway, against the fashion of the time, and believed that the light loads for Rainhill would even allow just a single driving axle. This allowed the simplification of not requiring either a chain drive between the axles or Stephenson's invention of the external coupling rods. Achieving adequate traction required more of Rocket's weight to be over the driving axle than the carrying axle. The heavy boiler was placed forwards, with the axle beneath it, giving a 0-2-2 layout rather than 2-2-0. The cylinders were set at a steep angle, as used the year before for Lancashire Witch, rather than the typical vertical cylinders of this period. The cylinders were thus over the firebox and both driver and fireman shared a footplate at the same, rear, end of the engine. Previously they had often been separated to their own ends of the engine.  Novelty  Ericsson and Braithwaite's entry for the Trials, their Novelty, was an 0-2-2 well tank locomotive. Both the driving wheels and trailing wheels were the same size, and there may also have been the facility to fit a coupling chain drive to give better adhesion 'when needed'. Novelty has also been described as a 2-2-0WT design, as there is no clear 'front' or 'rear' to this design.  Northumbrian  Rocket was the only locomotive to complete the trials successfully and Stephenson became the supplier of locomotives to the L&MR.; The 0-2-2 arrangement was subsequently used by Robert Stephenson and Company on eight locomotives supplied to the Liverpool and Manchester Railway after 1829:, Meteor, Comet, Dart, Arrow, Phoenix, North Star, Northumbrian, and Majestic. Like the rebuilt Rocket, these had their cylinders set low in a near-horizontal position. The Northumbrian type was superseded by the 2-2-0 Planet type. These reversed the layout, placing the cylinders inside, between the frames, and below the smokebox at the front. The inside cylinders were closer together, giving less of a rocking couple and so were less prone to yawing oscillation at speed. Placing the cylinders below the smokebox also permitted shorter steampipes and exhaust pipes to the blastpipe, giving better efficiency. Northumbrians were the last, and only, production locomotives with this wheel arrangement. After the Planets, most passenger locomotives began to use a 2-2-2 arrangement, with an additional front carrying axle to give better riding at speed.  Tank engines  Railmotor with 0-2-2 locomotive unit c.1905 In the early 20th Century a number of railmotors were built by various railway companies in the UK where the locomotive section had an 0-2-2 wheel arrangement, but they were designed to operate semi-permanently coupled to a coach unit. The LSWR C14 class used a similar layout, but reversed as a 2-2-0T. Their low adhesive weight gave them a poor performance and half of them were rebuilt as the 0-4-0T S14.

The tale was first published with three others in New Fairy Tales by C.A. Reitzel in November 1843. The four tales were received by the Danish critics with great acclaim. A print depicting the angel and child became very popular.  Plot  When the tale opens, a child has died, and an angel is escorting him to Heaven. They wander over the Earth for a while, visiting well-known places. Along the way they gather flowers to transplant into the gardens of Heaven. The angel takes the child to a poverty-stricken area where a dead field lily lies in a trash heap. The angel salvages the flower explaining that it had cheered a crippled boy before he died. The angel then reveals he was the boy, and they continue their journey.  Themes  Jens Andersen, author of Hans Christian Andersen: A New Life (2005), describes God as \\"one of Andersen's most beloved ghosts\\" and notes that God in \\"The Angel\\" is a \\"pleasant and helpful traveling companion [...] There are few figures in his works to whom he returns more often or examines from so many different childish angles\\". The poet had an unshakable faith that a whole new existence awaited him once his spirit left his earthly frame at the appropriate time. When Andersen was assailed with doubts regarding the soul's immortality, he reverted to his child faith and could not bring himself to suggest that the human being is simply dispersed as gases and other substances to fertilize the earth at death as the scientific Niels Bryde does in Andersen's 1857 novel To Be or Not to Be. Andersen regarded God as a release for those suffering and a new chance for those who have failed. God was an optimistic and promising beginning for Andersen.Andersen (Jens) 2005, pp. 330,537ff  Background  The tale is completely Andersen's invention, and may have been motivated by the death of the eldest daughter of his friends, Edvard and Jette Collins. The theme of a child transformed into an angel had possessed Andersen since the completion of his poem \\"The Dying Child\\".Wullschlager 2002, p. 235 According to Gustav Hetsch, the story is one of three Andersen stories (along with \\"Beneath the Pillar and \\"The Nightingale\\") to have been inspired by Jenny Lind.  Publication history  Illustration by Vilhelm Pedersen, Andersen's first illustrator \\"The Angel\\" was first published in Copenhagen on 11 November 1843 by C. A. Reitzel in the first volume of the first collection of New Fairy Tales. For the first time, the phrase \\"told for children\\" was not part of the title--an omission Andersen scholar and biographer Jackie Wullschlager believes exhibited a new confidence on Andersen's part: \\"These [tales] were the most mature and perfectly constructed tales he had written, and though some of them at once became, and have remained favorites of children, Andersen here melds together the childlike and the profound with exceptional artistry.\\"Wullschlager 2002, pp. 230-1,235 The first edition of 850 was sold out by December 18, and Reitzel planned publication of another 850. \\"The Angel\\" was the first tale in the volume that included \\"The Nightingale\\", \\"The Sweethearts; or, The Top and the Ball\\", and \\"The Ugly Duckling\\". The tale was republished 18 December 1849 in Fairy Tales and again on 15 December 1862 in Fairy Tales and Stories.The Angel Wullschlager describes \\"The Angel\\" as a \\"sentimental genre picture [...] that suited the taste of the times.\\" A print made from an illustration of the tale by the German artist Wilhelm von Kaulbach was widely popular and sold briskly. Andersen once found the print in Portugal, a country in which he was relatively unknown.  Critical response  New Fairy Tales was a break-through for Andersen who, until its publication, had generally received vigorous condemnation from the Danish critics for his venture into the fairy tale genre. Reviews for the collection however were ecstatic.  Notes  References   External links *Engelen. Original Danish text *\\"The Angel\\".

The notation 2-4-0T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement on which its water and fuel is carried on board the engine itself, rather than in an attached tender. Overview The 2-4-0 configuration was developed in the United Kingdom in the late 1830s or early 1840s as an enlargement of the 2-2-0 and 2-2-2 types, with the additional pair of coupled wheels giving better adhesion. The type was initially designed for freight haulage. One of the earliest examples was the broad-gauge GWR Leo Class, designed by Daniel Gooch and built during 1841 and 1842 by R and W Hawthorn and Company, Fenton, Murray and Jackson, and Rothwell and Company. Because of its popularity for a period with English railways, noted railway author C. Hamilton Ellis considered the 2-4-0 designation to have the nickname (under the Whyte notation) of Old English. During 1846-47, Alexander Allan of the newly established London and North Western Railway (LNWR) created the Crewe type of locomotive, with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement for passenger classes and 2-4-0 for freight. During the 1850s and 1860s these designs were widely copied by other railways, both in the United Kingdom and overseas.Hamilton Ellis, Some Classic Locomotives, George Allen and Unwin, 1949, pp.19-32. 0298 Class Well tank locomotive During the mid-1840s, Sir John Hawkshaw developed a new style of 2-4-0 passenger locomotive with outside cylinders in front of the leading wheels and the rear driving axle behind the firebox. This layout provided steady running at high speeds, despite a long overhang at the front.Hamilton Ellis, Pictorial encyclopaedia of railways, Hamlyn, 1968, pp.53-4. Joseph Beattie of the London and South Western Railway was one of the first British locomotive engineers to use this type on express locomotives.D.L. Bradley, Locomotives of the London and South Western Railway, Part 1. Railway Correspondence and Travel Society, 1965, p.58. From 1858, he began experimenting with 2-4-0 designs for passenger work, culminating in his Seven-Foot express passenger locomotives, built between 1859 and 1868.Bradley (1965), pp.52-76. Beattie was also responsible for the long-lived 0298 Class of 2-4-0 well tanks, designed for suburban passenger work in 1874, some examples of which were still working in 1961. A locomotive of this type hauled the first Orient Express from Paris to Munich, a notable achievement for such a small engine. After 1854, the Hawkshaw type of 2-4-0 was adopted by Beyer, Peacock and Company, who built many examples of the type for export, including to the Swedish State Railways (Statens J√§rnv√§gar) in 1856 and the Zealand Railway in Denmark in 1870.Hamilton Ellis, Pictorial enclyclopaedia of railways, p.54. Usage=Germany The Bavarian B V and Bavarian B VI 2-4-0 locomotives of the Royal Bavarian State Railways (K√∂niglich Bayerische Staats-Eisenbahnen) were the first types to be produced in Bavaria in large numbers. In all, 208 were built between 1853 and 1863. One example is preserved in the Nuremberg Transport Museum. Mecklenburg III class No. 19 ZWEIHUNDERT Between 1864 and 1869, the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Friedrich-Franz Railway bought 19 Hawkshaw type Mecklenburg III locomotives from Richard Hartmann in Chemnitz. Between 1877 and 1885, altogether 294 passenger locomotives of the Prussian P 2 class were delivered to the Prussian State Railways and its forebears. New Zealand In New Zealand, two classes of tank locomotive were built with the 2-4-0T wheel arrangement. They were the New Zealand Railways (NZR) D class in 1874 and 1929, and the NZR L class in 1878, both classes having been designed for mixed traffic use. Five D class locomotives were built by D√ºbs and Company in Glasgow, Scotland, nineteen were built by Neilson and Company and eleven were built by Scott Brothers Ltd. of Christchurch. The first members of the D class entered service in 1874 and all had been withdrawn from NZR service by the end of 1927, which allowed the D classification to be used again in 1929. Of the 33 D class locomotives built, seven have been preserved, although only D16 and D140 were in operational condition. All ten L class locomotives were built by the Avonside Engine Company in Bristol. The first L class built, entered service in 1878 and another nine L class locomotives were ordered. In 1893-94, three of the L class 2-4-0T locomotives were rebuilt to a 4-4-0 wheel arrangement at Newmarket workshops, with larger boilers and enlarged cylinders. This new design was classified La, but their limited coal bunker capacity remained a drawback. The solution was to add a trailing pony truck to accommodate a larger coal bunker, converting them to a 4-4-2T wheel arrangement. A further four L class locomotives were similarly converted. Three were not rebuilt, but sold to the Public Works Department between 1901 and 1903. Three new locomotives were built in 1902-03. When the conversion program was completed in 1903, the classification for all ten remaining NZR locomotives was changed back to L. Of the ten L class locomotives built, numbers 207 (507), 208 (508) and 219 (509) survived long enough to be preserved, all three operational. South Africa 2-4-0T Ebden in Cape Town, c. 1872 A standard gauge railway line between Salt River and Wynberg in the Cape of Good Hope, constructed with private capital, was opened to the public on 19 December 1864. The Cape Town Railway and Dock Company undertook to rent and operate the line and acquired three 2-4-0 tank locomotives as motive power for the line in 1864.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1943).

In 1872, the locomotives came onto the roster of the Cape Government Railways when it took over the operation of all railways in the Cape of Good Hope. They remained in service on this line until after its conversion to dual standard-and-Cape gauges around 1872 and were retired in 1881, when sufficient Cape gauge locomotives were in service.

Moorland Publishing, 1977. . LNWR's Improved Precedent class Hardwicke at York Railway Museum Between 1846 and 1880, the 2-4-0 was the standard type for passenger and mixed traffic locomotives and was built in large numbers by, amongst others, the LNWR (1846‚Äì96), the Midland Railway (1846‚Äì1880), the Great Northern Railway (1849‚Äì97), the North Eastern Railway (1856‚Äì88) and the Great Eastern Railway (1856‚Äì1902). Most United Kingdom railways used 2-4-0s, including those designed by James Holden on the Great Eastern Railway, Matthew Kirtley on the Midland Railway, Joseph Armstrong on the Great Western Railway and Francis Webb on the London and North Western Railway. One of the latter's types, the Precedent (or Jumbo) class Hardwicke famously set outstanding records for the LNWR during the \\"Race to the North\\" in 1895.

Both were based in Ambarawa, where they have served for more than a hundred years. Locomotive B25-01 may also still be found at the entrance to the Ambarawa Railway Museum. On the island of Sumatra, there are some larger cousins of this class being used for hauling coal trains, namely the D18 and E10 classes. New Zealand NZR C class of 1873 The 0-4-2T arrangement was used by two classes of locomotives operated by the New Zealand Railways Department. The first was the C class of 1873, originally built as an 0-4-0T. The class was found to be unstable at speeds higher than 15 mph, so by 1880 all members of the class had been converted to 0-4-2T to rectify this problem. The second and more notable 0-4-2T class, and the only one actually built as 0-4-2T, was the unique H class designed to operate the Rimutaka Incline on the Wairarapa Line. The Incline's steep gradient necessitated the use of the Fell mountain railway system, and the six members of the H class spent their entire lives operating trains on the Incline. Except for a few brief experiments with other classes, the H class had exclusive use of the Incline from their introduction in 1875 until the Incline's closure in 1955. The class leader, H 199, is preserved on static display at the Fell Engine Museum in Featherston and is the only extant Fell locomotive in the world. The 0-4-2T arrangement was also employed for steam locomotives operated by small private industrial railways and bush and mineral tramways. One such locomotive, built by Peckett and Sons in 1957, is currently operational on the Heritage Park Railway, Whangarei. She is one of four such locomotives imported from Peckett and Sons, and was the last steam locomotive imported into New Zealand in the steam era. Two others worked alongside her and are preserved, whilst the fourth was owned by a forestry railway, who converted her to a Diesel locomotive. South AfricaStandard gauge= Blackie plinthed at Cape Town station In September 1859, Messrs. E. & J. Pickering, contractors to the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company for the construction of the Cape Town-Wellington Railway, imported a small 0-4-0 side-tank steam locomotive from England for use during the construction of the railway. This was the first locomotive in South Africa. In c. 1874, the locomotive was rebuilt to a 0-4-2T configuration before it was shipped to Port Alfred, where it served as construction locomotive on the banks of the Kowie river and was nicknamed Blackie. It has been declared a heritage object and was plinthed in the main concourse of Cape Town station.Blackie, Article by D. Littley, SA Rail September‚ÄìOctober 1989, Published by RSSA, p. 133. In 1860, the Cape Town Railway and Dock Company took delivery of eight standard gauge tender locomotives with a 0-4-2 wheel arrangement for service on the Cape Town-Wellington Railway, which was still under construction. They remained in service on this line while it was being converted to dual standard-and-Cape gauges from around 1872 and were only retired in 1881, when sufficient Cape gauge locomotives were in service. =Cape gauge= Two tank engine classes of this wheel arrangement were supplied to the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij (NZASM) by Maschinenfabriek Esslingen and Breda, Nederland between 1890 and 1894. NZASM 19 Tonner no. 17 * The earlier class of twenty-four 19 Tonner locomotives, built by Maschinenfabriek Esslingen and , were delivered between 1890 and 1892. Between 1906 and 1909, while in Central South African Railways (CSAR) service, ten of them were converted to rail motor engines for use on suburban services. In 1912, these locomotives were taken onto the South African Railways (SAR) roster as obsolete unclassified locomotives.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer‚Äôs Office, Pretoria, January 1912, p. 2 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) * The later class of four 32 Tonner rack locomotives, built by Esslingen in 1894 and 1897, was equipped with pinions for use on the rack railway section between Waterval Onder and Waterval Boven in the eastern Transvaal. They survived through the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) and CSAR eras and, even though the rack section was removed in 1908, they were still in service in 1912 when they were taken onto the SAR roster as obsolete unclassified locomotives. =Narrow gauges= SAR Class NG2 Between 1897 and 1901, several 0-4-2 saddle tank steam locomotives, built for narrow gauge by Dickson Manufacturing Company of Scranton in Pennsylvania, were delivered to various gold mines on the Witwatersrand by Arthur Koppel, acting as importing agents. In 1915, when an urgent need arose for additional locomotives in Deutsch-S√ºdwest-Afrika during the First World War, two of these locomotives were purchased second-hand by the SAR for use on the narrow gauge lines in that territory. The two locomotives remained in South West Africa after the war and were later designated Class NG2 on the SAR.Information supplied by John N.

Drawing Office, Pretoria, 28 November 1932 Pioneer derailed outside O'okiep after a Boer commando attack The Namaqua Copper Company's first gauge locomotive, acquired in 1901, was a Dick, Kerr- built 0-4-2ST named Pioneer which was rebuilt from the configuration, possibly due to the additional weight of fuel tanks which were installed under the cab when it was converted to use fuel oil. The company also operated four more tank locomotives, one 9 Ton and three 12 Ton, possibly also acquired from Dick, Kerr. In 1904, a single gauge 0-4-2 inverted saddle-tank locomotive named Caledonia was placed in service by the Cape Copper Company as a shunting engine at O'okiep in the Cape Colony. In 1905, the Cape Copper Company also placed a single 0-4-2 tank locomotive named Britannia in service as a shunting engine at Port Nolloth in the Cape Colony. United Kingdom 1400 class No. 4866 at Didcot From the mid-1860s onwards, the 0-4-2 wheel arrangement tended only to be used on tank engines in the United Kingdom. Exceptions were in Scotland on the Caledonian and Glasgow and South Western railways and in southern England on the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) and the London and South Western Railway. The LB&SCR; uniquely built express passenger 0-4-2 tender classes until 1891. Stroudley's D-tank From 1868, the Great Western Railway built a number of standard gauge 0-4-2T classes for branch line passenger work to a design known as the 517 class by engineer George Armstrong. This design was developed until the GWR 1400 Class was built between 1932 and 1936, designed for push-pull autotrains. These were the last British examples of this wheel arrangement. Four of them have been preserved. William Stroudley of the LB&SCR; built four very successful 0-4-2 classes, three tenders and one tank, between 1873 and 1891. The first of these was his powerful D-tank for suburban passenger work. By 1887, 125 of these had been built, some of which survived in service until 1951. However, the most famous 0-4-2 class were his Gladstone class express passenger locomotives, the first of which has been preserved. United States The Casper for South Fork and Eastern railroad used an locomotive number two \\"Daisey\\" an 1885 Baldwin 0-4-2T locomotive to haul its logging operations in its early days (Baldwin builder number 7558).

Another 25 locomotives of the C class were built in 1906 by the North British Locomotive Company (which succeeded D√ºbs) and were regarded as distinct from the Dagupan class. During the Manila Railroad era, they were replaced in mainline service by American tender locomotives such as the Porter 4-6-0 built in 1919 or the 4-6-2 Pacifics built by Baldwin Locomotive Works between 1926 and 1929.

Acquired to meet the traffic needs of the upper mountainous section of the line, they became known as the Mountain type. The first three of these locomotives were later described as the Clara Class, while the fourth was included in this Class by some and included in the subsequent Scotia Class by others. Between 1900 and 1905, six more Mountain type 0-6-2 tender locomotives were placed in service by the Cape Copper Company. Later described as the Scotia Class, they were similar to the earlier Clara Class locomotives, but with longer boilers, longer fireboxes and larger firegrates. =Tank locomotive= In 1892 and 1893, the Nederlandsche-Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg-Maatschappij of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Transvaal Republic) placed twenty 0-6-2T locomotives in mainline service.

United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the type was only ever used for tank engines and was first used by William Barton Wright of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1880. The arrangement was soon afterwards used by F.W. Webb of the London and North Western Railway on his famous Coal Tanks of 1881‚Äì1897. Many locomotives of this type were also used to haul coal in the South Wales Valleys by the Great Western Railway and its predecessors. LBSCR E5 class of 1904 Several railways around London later used the type for heavy suburban passenger trains, notably the following: * The London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR; ) with the E3, E4, E5 and E6 classes designed by R. J. Billinton between 1894 and 1904. * The Great Eastern Railway (GER) Class L77 of 1914, designed by Alfred John Hill. * The Great Northern Railway (GNR) Class N1 designed by Ivatt, and Class N2, designed by Nigel Gresley between 1906 and 1921. Gresley later improved upon the GER class with various versions of his London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) N7 class, built between 1925 and 1928. United States of America In the United States, 0-6-2 locomotives were largely 2-6-0 type locomotives which had been rebuilt with a larger firebox and therefore required greater weight distribution near their backs. The leading wheels were therefore relocated to the rear as trailing wheels. Nearly all of these locomotives were assigned to switch locomotive workings or used on branch lines. Many 0-6-2 types were found in the state of Hawaii on sugar cane railroads across the state. Most notable were the 0-6-2T‚Äôs of the Mcbryde Sugar Company of Kauai, 3 of which survive and are currently the only original steam engines operating in Hawaii.

Between 1893 and 1898, 175 46 Tonner steam locomotives were placed in service, built by the Maschinenfabrik Esslingen in Germany. In 1899, twenty more were ordered from the Nederlandse Fabriek van Werktuigen en Spoorwegmaterieel (Werkspoor) in the Netherlands, of which only two were delivered by the time the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) took over all railway operations in the ZAR during the Second Boer War.

Nine locomotives of this type were supplied by Beyer, Peacock and Company for the opening of the Mersey Railway in 1886. William Dean built three crane tanks in 1901, and Kitson & Co. of Leeds supplied nine locomotives to the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway in 1904. Other examples included the Midland Railway 2000 Class of 1907, the Highland Railway Drummond 0-6-4T Class of 1909, the SECR J class of 1913 and the Metropolitan Railway G Class of 1915. The type was eventually superseded by the popular 2-6-4T locomotive. United States of America In the United States, the 0-6-4 locomotive was largely built only for use in railyards, essentially as an adaptation of an 0-6-0 switch engine with an extended firebox, or a 4-6-0 reconstructed with a larger firebox which necessitated the relocation of the leading wheels to the rear to support the firebox.

Georg von Frundsberg (24 September 1473 - 20 August 1528) was a German military and Landsknecht leader in the service of the Holy Roman Empire and Imperial House of Habsburg. An early modern proponent of infantry tactics, he established his reputation in active service during the Italian Wars under Emperor Maximilian I and his successor Charles V. Life Frundsberg was born to Ulrich von Frundsberg, a captain of the Swabian League forces, and his wife Barbara von Rechberg at Mindelheim, into an old line of Tyrolean knights who had settled in Upper Swabia. In 1492 he followed his father in the campaign of the Hohenzollern margrave Frederick I of Brandenburg-Ansbach, authorized to execute the Imperial ban against Duke Albert IV of Bavaria. As Albert gave in, the expedition was cancelled. Frundsberg fought for the Habsburg emperor Maximilian I against the Swiss Confederacy in the Swabian War of 1499, where he had to realize that the era of the heavy armoured knights was well and truly over. In the same year he was among the Imperial troops sent to the aid of Ludovico Sforza, who had been deposed as Duke of Milan by King Louis XII of France. When Maximilian appointed him Tyrolean military captain, he recruited a powerful army of pike square infantry formations following the Swiss example. Still serving Maximilian, he took part in the 1504 War of the Succession of Landshut, fighting against Count Ruprecht of the Palatinate and his father Elector Palatine Philip. Frundsberg distinguished himself leading a Landsknecht regiment into the decisive Battle of Wenzenbach, whereafter Maximilian I personally bestowed knighthood on him: armed with muskets and culverines, the Frundsberg regiment broke a breach into the wagon-wall of the Bohemian mercenaries (composed 300+ wagons), which were then routed. Convinced of the necessity of a native body of trained infantry, Frundsberg assisted Maximilian in the organization of the Landsknecht troops. One year later, he became the commander of the Landsknechts in the Habsburg Netherlands. Thereafter, Frundsberg lived an uninterrupted life of war, campaigning for the Empire and the Habsburgs. In 1509, he was appointed \\"Highest Field Captain\\" of the Landsknecht Regiment (occupation force) and participated in the War of the League of Cambrai against the Republic of Venice, winning fame for himself and his men after defending the city of Verona against numerous attacks. In 1512 he was, together with Jakob von Ems, leading the Imperial contingent sent to aid Gaston de Foix to retake Brescia. After a short visit to Germany, he returned to the Italian peninsula, where he gained fresh laurels by his enterprises against the Venetians and the French. He was heading the Landsknechts at the side of the Spanish commander Fernando d'Avalos at the 1513 Battle of La Motta, routing the vastly outnumbering Venetian troops according to Frundsberg's motto Viel Feind', viel Ehr' (\\"Many foes, much honor\\"). Peace being made, he returned to Germany, and at the head of the infantry of the Swabian League assisted in driving Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, from his duchy in 1519. At the Diet of Worms in 1521, he allegedly spoke words of encouragement to the \\"little monk\\" Martin Luther, and during the Italian War of 1521‚Äì26, Frundsberg helped lead the Imperial Army into Picardy. When King Francis I of France appeared on the battlefield with a force of approximately 40,000 men, the clever withdrawal of Emperor Charles V's army saved its existence. Frundsberg considered the withdrawal on Valenciennes as \\"the greatest luck and most appropriate measure during war.\\" After the French campaign in 1522 ended and Frundsberg resigned from the leadership of the Landesknechts, he returned to lead the march of 6,000 men on upper Italy. A difficult alpine crossing through deep snow led to the Battle of Bicocca near Milan in April. Swiss nationals on foot fought alongside Frundsberg, who led and fought from the front. The emperor's victory at Bicocca allowed the return of the previous rulers of the oligarchic Republic of Genoa and the Duchy of Milan and brought the greater part of Lombardy under the influence of Charles V. In 1525, after a brief stop in Mindelheim as the \\"Highest Field Captain\\" of the entire German Nation (with a force consisting of 12,000 men and twenty-nine flag bearers), Frundsberg moved again towards upper Italy to relieve Pavia and to save the Empire's Duchy of Milan. Despite an additional 6,000 men, of whom some were Spanish, in battle against an enemy that was strongest, Frundsberg won his most famous victory at Pavia, with the capture of the French king. Only one year later, when the war in Italy was renewed in 1526, Frundsberg received a call for help from the Emperor's Army in Lombardy, to help decide the war. Albeit an insufficient amount, he obtained 36,000 German Thaler to organize the new army. During his occupation of Mindelheim, Frundsberg borrowed money and sold off his silver table settings and his wife's jewelry, in order to acquire the remaining funds to raise the army. In less than three weeks, Frundsberg organized over 12,000 men and crossed the Alps during the middle of November. He joined the Constable de Bourbon near Piacenza and marched towards Rome. However, order and discipline broke down near Modena on 13 March 1527, when no decisive battle developed after months of campaigning in Italy. Payment for the mercenaries remained overdue and, in the end, even Frundsberg was unable to rally the Landsknechts and restore order. The matter shook the old commander to such an extent that he suffered a stroke. Unable to regain his physical strength, Frundsberg was moved to Germany after a long struggle in Italian hospitals. Tormented by great anxiety over the situation with his mercenaries or \\"beloved sons\\", the loss of his personal estate and death of one of his sons, Frundsberg died in his castle in Mindelheim. Though there is no evidence that he ever left the Catholic Church, and in spite of his constant loyalty to the Catholic Emperor, Frundsberg was quite receptive to the message of Martin Luther and according to some stories, before the campaign of 1527, he motivated his troops (mainly Lutherans) by promising to hang the pope with a golden rope.Heroes of History, Will Durant Legacy Frundsberg was considered a capable and chivalrous soldier, and a devoted servant of the Habsburgs. A son had been killed in Italy in 1524 just before the battle of Pavia. Another son Caspar (1500-1536) and his grandson Georg (died 1586) were both soldiers of some distinction. With the latter's death, the family became extinct. In 1841 a bust by Max von Widnmann was added to the Walhalla memorial. Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria had a statue erected in his honour at the Hall of Generals (Feldherrenhalle) of the Vienna Museum of Military History, inaugurated in 1866, and the Austro- Hungarian corvette SMS Frundsberg launched in 1873 was named after him. During World War II, the Waffen-SS 10th Panzer Division by order of 3 October 1943 was given the honorific title Frundsberg. In literature Georg von Frundsberg is a character in the historical novel The Adventurer, AKA Michael The Finn (Mikael Karvajalka) by Mika Waltari.

In the United States, a simple expansion (simplex) version of the type was used only on the Southern Pacific and Union Pacific Railroads. Baldwin Locomotive Works built an experimental compound expansion in 1926, but since the weight and length of this engine was too much for all but the heaviest and straightest track and compound steam locomotives had already lost favor on United States railroads, its demonstration runs failed to generate interest and no more were produced.Swengel, F.M.

Usage=Brazil Brazilian 4-10-2 at the Museum of Technology, S√£o Paulo Brazil had 4-10-2 tender locomotives, built by Henschel in 1936. These were converted to gauge in 1940. South Africa Between 1899 and 1903, the Natal Government Railways (NGR) placed 101 tank locomotives in service. The locomotive was designed by G.W. Reid, the Locomotive Superintendent of the NGR at the end of the nineteenth century, and built in Scotland by D√ºbs and Company and the newly established North British Locomotive Company. On the NGR, the locomotive type became known as the Reid Tenwheeler and was officially designated Class C.The Railway Report for year ending 31 Dec. 1908, Natal Government Railways, p. 39, par 14. The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type that allowed the axle some lateral movement. In order to negotiate sharp curves, both the first and fifth sets of coupled wheels were flangeless, but since the blind trailing coupled wheels had a tendency to derail while reversing, particularly over points, their tyre width was later increased from to . In 1912, after the establishment of the South African Railways, the surviving unmodified NGR locomotives were designated Class H.Classification of S.A.R. Engines with Renumbering Lists, issued by the Chief Mechanical Engineer's Office, Pretoria, January 1912, pp. 7, 11, 13, 22‚Äì25 (Reprinted in April 1987 by SATS Museum, R.3125-6/9/11-1000) CSAR Class E In 1901 and 1902, towards the end of the Second Boer War, the Imperial Military Railways also acquired 35 Reid Tenwheeler locomotives from D√ºbs and Company and Neilson, Reid and Company. After the war, they came onto the roster of the Central South African Railways (CSAR), who designated them Class E. In 1903, the CSAR modified six of them to locomotives and, beginning in 1905, the remainder to tank-and-tender locomotives. A final order for one new Reid Tenwheeler was placed by Witbank Collieries as late as 1927. The total of 137 locomotives built to this design was about double the number of all other locomotives in use elsewhere in the world, all of which were tender locomotives that served in the United States and Brazil. United States of America In the United States, the type was used only on the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), which called it the Southern Pacific, and the Union Pacific Railroad (UP), which called it the Overland after their corporate sobriquet, The Overland Route. Only sixty locomotives of this wheel arrangement were built for domestic service and all but one were constructed as simplex three-cylinder engines.Boynton, James E. (1973). 4-10-2: Three Barrels of Steam. Glenwood: Felton. pp. 2, 5‚Äì6, 84‚Äì98, 144‚Äì149. In 1925, the SP placed an order for sixteen locomotives with the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and, later in the same year, the UP ordered one. The first SP locomotive, no. 5000, was completed in April 1925, while the UP locomotive, no. 8000, was completed the following month. Within a few months, the SP ordered more of these engines and built up a fleet of 49. The UP, on the other hand, waited thirteen months before repeating orders and establishing a fleet of ten locomotives. All 59 were simplex locomotives and were built by ALCO. Baldwin 60000 in the Franklin Institute Science Museum In 1926, Baldwin Locomotive Works constructed an experimental demonstrator, the Baldwin 60000, which was a three-cylinder compound locomotive, the only so constructed. This engine used high-pressure steam in the inside cylinder and then exhausted that steam into the two low-pressure outside cylinders. It also had a water tube boiler, one of a very few locomotives so equipped in the United States. As technologically innovative as Baldwin's was, however, it was outmoded when built since compound steam locomotives had already lost favor in United States railroading. It was found that the type ran better and rode smoother than the type from which it had evolved. The third cylinder in the center of the cylinder saddle sloped down at a 9¬Ω degree angle to a crank on the second drivers' axle, while the two outside rods connected to the third drivers. The three-cylinder feature on these locomotives gave them a distinctive sound at work, described as a \\"hop, skip and jump rhythm\\". While the SP engines could operate only on relatively straight and heavily built mainlines, their long service lives of between 28 and 30 years proved that they were good locomotives. The most serious mishap was when, in November 1946, one of the SP locomotives suffered a boiler explosion which killed four train crew. In addition, the inside cylinder's rod created serious maintenance problems because the floating bushings could fail, which lengthen maintenance down-time since such failures required major valve re-settings that caused delays. It was reported that such failures created such great pounding on the rails that railroad housewives along the line \\"complained of crockery cracking when a defective rumbled past their homes\\". When the UP became tired of the major mechanical problems associated with three cylinders, it converted its locomotives to two-cylinder locomotives in 1942 and renumbered them 5090 to 5099. Two locomotives of this type have been preserved: * Southern Pacific 5021, on static display at the Los Angeles County Fairgrounds in Pomona, California. * The Baldwin 60000 demonstrator, as a moving display at the Franklin Institute Science Museum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Overview The 0-6-6-0 wheel arrangement was used mostly on Mallet locomotives, on which the engine units were mounted either in tandem or facing each other. Usage=Canada The only compound Mallets to operate in Canada were the R1 class Vaughan design locomotives, with the cylinder ends of the engine units facing each other. The class was owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway and served on the Big Hill in British Columbia, which had a 4.1% grade. Five locomotives were built between 1909 and 1911. A sixth one was built, but it was a simple expansion Mallet with two sets of high-pressure cylinders. All the locomotives in this class were later converted to types and were used as shunting and transfer engines in Montreal. Germany The Saxon Class XV HTV was a class of goods train tank steam locomotive operated by the Royal Saxon State Railways, which had been conceived for hauling trains and acting as banking engines for routes in the Ore Mountains. The two CCh4v locomotives were built in 1916 at the S√§chsischen Maschinenfabrik, formerly Hartmann. In 1925, the Deutsche Reichsbahn grouped them into their DRG Class 79.0. The locomotive was of unusual design with two fixed six-coupled engine units with a central double cylinder on each side, each with a high-pressure cylinder for the rear and a low-pressure cylinder for the front drive. United States of America The first Mallet locomotive in North America was built in the United States and was of this type, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Class O no. 2400. Nicknamed Old Maude after a cartoon mule, it had a tractive effort and was a great success despite a top speed of only . A 0-6-6-0 Mallet of the New York Central Railroad The Kansas City Southern used the type as freight engines, with pilots, and had the most of them with twelve locomotives. The 0-6-6-0 wheel arrangement was also used to a limited extent on logging railroads and in mountain terminals. The Western Maryland Railway had a small fleet of 2-6-6-2 locomotives which, at one time, were the heaviest locomotives in the world, weighing 264 Tons. They were all converted to 0-6-6-0 locomotives for heavy switching.

The enzyme, released into the mouth along with the saliva, catalyzes the first reaction in the digestion of dietary lipid, with diglycerides being the primary reaction product. However, due to the unique characteristics of lingual lipase, including a pH optimum 4.5‚Äì5.4 and its ability to catalyze reactions without bile salts, the lipolytic activity continues through to the stomach. Enzyme release is signaled by autonomic nervous system after ingestion, at which time the serous glands under the circumvallate and foliate lingual papillae on the surface of the tongue secrete lingual lipase to the grooves of the circumvallate and foliate papillae, co-localized with fat taste receptors. The hydrolysis of the dietary fats is essential for fat absorption by the small intestine, as long chain triacylglycerides cannot be absorbed, and as much as 30% of fat is hydrolyzed within 1 to 20 minutes of ingestion by lingual lipase alone. Lingual lipase, together with gastric lipase, comprise the two acidic lipases.  Proposed mechanism  Lingual Lipase with catalytic triad highlighted in center Lingual lipase uses a catalytic triad consisting of aspartic acid-203 (Asp), histidine-257 (His), and serine-144 (Ser), to initiate the hydrolysis of a triglyceride into a diacylglyceride and a free fatty acid. First, there is a series of deprotonations that make the serine a better nucleophile. The lone pair on the oxygen of the serine then undergoes a nucleophilic addition to either the first or the third carbonyl of the triacylglycerol. Next, the electrons that had moved to form the carbonyl transfer back down to reform the carbonyl. Then the diacylglycerol leaving group is protonated by His-257. Following another round of deprotonations, the lone pair on the oxygen of water undergoes a nucleophilic addition to the carbonyl that reformed in the previous step. The electrons that had moved up from the carbonyl come back down to reform it and kick off the Ser, which again induces the chain of deprotonation. The final products of the reaction are the conserved catalytic triad, a diacylglycerol and a free fatty acid. Monoacylglyceride is also present in a lower concentration and is produced following a second round of hydrolysis by the same mechanism. It acts on tryglicerides to help breakdown food as a part of saliva composition. Mechanism of Triglyceride Hydrolysis  Cystic fibrosis  Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an 85% chance of additionally experiencing the effects of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In the most extreme cases, these patients will produce no pancreatic lipase, yet even when the enzyme is completely absent, dietary fat is still absorbed. Studies have shown that even in these cases, lingual lipase is present in normal amounts, and contributes to greater than 90% of total lipase activity in duodenum. This can be attributed to the fact that lingual lipase has a low pH optimum and can thus remain active through the stomach into the duodenum, where there is a low pH in patients with CF. It has, thus, been proposed that a possible treatment option for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency would be enzyme replacement therapy using lingual lipase, increasing the amount of dietary fat absorption and decreasing the risk of malnutrition. The proposed mechanism of lingual lipase preferentially cleaving short and medium chain triacylglycerols provides a means for absorption without the need for micelle formation and chylomicrons. Short and medium chain free fatty acids can be absorbed directly through the mucosal cells into the blood stream without further packaging and hence play a crucial role in nutrition for CF patients (and neonates).  Fat digestion in neonates  In the uterus, the fetus is dependent on a high- carbohydrate diet, and lingual as well as gastric lipases are present in the fetus from 26 weeks of gestation on. After birth, fat in mother's milk or a milk substitute becomes the major source of nutrition. Absorptive rates of dietary fat are much lower in neonates than in adults, 65‚Äì80% as compared to >95% respectively, which can be attributed to low pancreatic lipase activity. Furthermore, milk fat is not a good substrate for pancreatic lipase. This fact, in combination with the bile salt deficiency and low pH throughout the gastrointestinal tract of the neonate, demands that lingual lipase be the main enzyme catalyzing the hydrolysis of dietary fat. This enzyme activity has been seen as early as 26 weeks gestational age, with ability to hydrolyze dietary fats variable according to digestive tract maturity.

Only one 2-8-8-8-4 was ever built, a Mallet-type for the Virginian Railway in 1916. Built by Baldwin Locomotive Works, it became the only example of their class XA, so named due to the experimental nature of the locomotive. Like the same railroad's large articulated electrics and the Erie Railroad 2-8-8-8-2s, it was nicknamed \\"Triplex\\". An overview of Triplex engineering is given at Triplex (locomotive). The XA was unable to sustain a speed greater than five miles an hour, since the six cylinders could easily consume more steam than the boiler could produce. When operating in compound the high pressure steam was divided between the cylinders of the center engine. The exhaust from one cylinder was piped to the front articulated engine. The exhaust from the other center engine cylinder was piped to the tender engine. The exhaust from the front engine was piped to the exhaust nozzle inside the firebox to generate draft through the firebox, through the fire tubes and out the exhaust stack. The exhaust from the tender engine went out of a stack at the rear of the tender water tank. Unfortunately it did not contribute to draft, being wasted. The tender had a four-wheel truck at the rear to help guide the locomotive into curves when drifting back downhill after pushing a train over the hill. The XA was sent back to Baldwin in 1920 and was rebuilt as two locomotives, a 2-8-8-0, later a 2-8-8-2, and a 2-8-2. Unlike their progenitor which lasted only a few years in service, these two locomotives remained in service until 1953.

There shall be no rules. This set the light-hearted spirit of the 16 mm fraternity, where a sense of fun and whimsy often override more serious concerns. The use of live steam as the predominant motive power of the models means absolute scale reproduction is often sacrificed to the demands of steam engineering at this scale. However the realistic sound, smell and visual effects of steam-driven locomotives makes up for loss of fidelity elsewhere. Driving a live steam locomotive, even at this small scale is very different from driving an electrically powered model. For many years there were no commercially available parts, and everything was hand-built or kit-bashed from O scale components. In the early 1970s Archangel emerged as the first commercial manufacturer on a large scale, followed by Merlin and Beck at the end of that decade. All three companies produced affordable live steam locomotives in this scale. In 1981 Mamod entered the market with a cheap if somewhat crude steam loco for the UK market. Although not perfect, the low cost opened the hobby to a much wider range of people and as a result demand for other products grew. Today, Roundhouse almost dominate the market as builders of high quality live steam locomotives. A vibrant group of professional and hobbyist makers have emerged to meet this demand.

It is often regarded as among the first city building games and god games. A turn-based strategy game with some real- time elements, it is credited as \\"arguably the earliest ancestor of the real- time strategy genre.\\" In July 2010, the game was re-released on Microsoft's Game Room service for its Xbox 360 console and for Games for Windows Live. Gameplay In-game screenshot Utopia is a two-player game in which the two players each control one of the game's two islands. It lacks an AI opponent, although a single player can play to achieve a high score and ignore the other island. When starting the game, the players may choose how many rounds to play (up to 50) and the length of each round (30 to 120 seconds). The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game. Each player rules their own island and uses the controller disc to move a rectangular cursor around the screen. Both players spend gold bars to construct different buildings (houses, schools, factories, hospitals and forts) on their islands, build fishing boats or PT boats, or to fund rebel activity on the enemy island. As each island's population grows, the ruler is responsible for housing their people, feeding their populace and keeping them happy, or else risk rebel activity, which decreases the player's score and sometimes destroys buildings. Income is generated when randomly generated rain clouds, (and sometimes hurricanes) pass over a player's farms, when a fishing boat is positioned over a school of fish, and at the end of each turn, based on the player's factory output and fishing boats. Most rounds consist of constructing a building, then continuously maneuvering the player's fishing boat over a moving school of fish in order to maintain fishing income, with occasional interruptions to construct new buildings whenever the player is able to afford them. Alternatively, the player in the lead might spend considerable time maneuvering a PT boat to try and sink the losing player's fishing boat in order to keep their income down. Game algorithms generate and determine the course of rain clouds, tropical storms, hurricanes, schools of fish, and pirate ships. Legacy GameSpy included Utopia in its Hall of Fame in 2004, commenting: \\"Considering the state of home video-game technology in 1981, Utopia is an astonishingly detailed simulation.\\"GameSpy Hall of Fame Article on Utopia GameSpot featured Utopia in its series Unsung Heroes: Ground Breaking Games, calling it a \\"surprisingly complex game (often referred to as 'Civilization 0.5') [that] laid the foundation for PC sim classics such as Civilization and SimCity.\\" In 2012, Utopia has been included in the Smithsonian Institution's \\"The Art of Video Games\\" exhibition. Utopia was a turn-based strategy game with some real-time elements. Ars Technica cites Utopia as being the \\"birth of a genre\\", stating that its mixing of turn-based and real-time strategic gameplay was \\"virtually unheard of\\", and that it is thus \\"arguably the earliest ancestor of the real-time strategy genre\\". Matt Barton and Bill Loguidice say it \\"helped set the template for the real-time strategy genre\\", but has \\"more in common with SimCity than it does with Dune II and later RTS games.\\" Brett Weiss argues that \\"[m]ost experts consider Utopia\\" to be \\"the first real-time strategy game.\\" A remake of the game has been announced for release exclusively for the Intellivision Amico.

Born in a small town in East Texas, these roots would influence his work for his entire life. In World War II he served as an officer aboard an aircraft carrier in the South Pacific, where he began work on one of his most important and critically acclaimed books, The House of Breath. After the war and through the 1950s, he published short stories, collections of stories, other novels, and plays. He never achieved commercial success in America, but his translated work was highly regarded in Europe. During his life he could not completely support himself through his writing, so at various times he took work as an editor and teacher at several prominent universities. At one point he did not write fiction for several years, calling it a \\"relief\\" to not have to worry about his writing. Major themes in his work include home and family, place, time, sexuality, isolation, and memory. His style of writing is not easily categorized, and he eschewed labels of genre placed on his works. In 1963, he married Doris Roberts, the actress perhaps best known for her work in Everybody Loves Raymond; they remained together until his death in 1983. Biography=Early years Goyen was born in the small town of Trinity, Texas, on April 24, 1915, to Charles Provine and Mary Inez (n√©e Trow) Goyen. His father worked at the local sawmill, and his mother's family ran the post office. He was the oldest of three children and thought to be epileptic; he \\"was subject to sudden and prolonged spells of crying.\\" In 1923 he moved with his family to Houston. He resided in the Woodland Heights neighborhood, where he attended Travis Elementary School and Hogg Middle School.Goyen, William. \\"While You Were Away (Houston Seen and Unseen, 1923-1978).\\" In: Goyen, William (Editor: Reginald Gibbons). Goyen: Autobiographical Essays, Notebooks, Evocations, Interviews. Goyen: Autobiographical Essays, Notebooks, Evocations, Interviews. University of Texas Press, May 1, 2007. , 9780292714915. Start: p. 39. Cited: p. 43-44. In 1932 he graduated from Sam Houston High School. He attended Rice Institute (now University), where he earned a BA in literature (1937) and an MA in comparative literature (1939). He briefly pursued a Ph.D. at the University of Iowa. Career Goyen taught for one year at the University of Houston in 1939, then joined in the U.S. Navy that same year. During World War II he served as an officer on the aircraft carrier in the South Pacific. After the war he and Navy friend Walter Berns moved to Taos, New Mexico, where they lived near benefactor Frieda Lawrence (widow of D.H. Lawrence) to pursue writing. He traveled and lived at various times in New Mexico, Europe, New York, and California, living principally in New York. From 1955 to 1960, he taught creative writing at the New School of Social Research, which provided opportunities for European travel and literary productivity. During the 1960s he taught at various universities, including Columbia, Princeton, and the University of Houston. From 1966 to 1971 he was a senior trade editor for McGraw-Hill, but resigned to return to his writing. In 1973 he was visiting Professor of English at Brown University. He moved to Los Angeles in 1975 and lived there most of the rest of his life. Personal life Biographers have noted his sometimes excessive drinking, sometimes fragile mental state and ambiguous sexual orientation. His drinking at times became debilitating. Of his mental state when he would work, Goyen stated: \\"Ghost and Flesh ... you can see in those stories ... wow ... quite surreal and I loved those, and when that was finished and published, I kind of went off the beam. I think the book made me quite mad; writing it, the obsession of that book;‚Ä¶\\" In 1951 he had an affair with writer Katherine Anne Porter, but their restored letters to each other during this time reveal \\"the convoluted nature\\" of their relationship, \\"one of the most hopeless of her life\\". His interest in the theater and stage productions (original plays and adaptations of his own work) brought him into contact with the actress Doris Roberts, who starred in one of his plays. They married on November 10, 1963. In an interview after his death, Ms. Roberts said the greatest influence on her life was Goyen, referring to him as her \\"mentor\\". In 1971, Goyen had a conversion experience, which he described in some detail: This experience produced the nonfiction work, A Book of Jesus. Of this work Goyen said: \\"A very real man began to live with me, of flesh and blood. He did the same work on me that He did on the people of the New Testament that He walked among‚Ä¶.\\" Last years and death In 1976 he joined Alcoholics Anonymous and stopped drinking altogether. His later years were among the most productive in his life. He died in Los Angeles of leukemia on August 30, 1983, aged 68, two months before his novel Arcadio was published. Writing Goyen began writing what would become his first book, The House of Breath, when he served on an aircraft carrier during World War II. After the war he continued work on the novel and began writing short stories. His first published short story, \\"The White Rooster,\\" appeared in Mademoiselle in April 1947. Other stories included \\"The Fallen Splendid House\\" in Southwest Review, in Spring 1949, and \\"A Bridge of Breath\\" in Partisan Review, in June 1949. In 1948 he received a Literary Fellowship from Southwest Review. During this time he was also working on a translation from French of Albert Cossery's Les fain√©ants dans la vall√©e fertile (The Lazy Ones), which would be published in 1952. In 1950, his first book, The House of Breath, was received with critical acclaim and led to support through fellowships and awards. In 1950‚Äì51, he lived in New York, Chicago, Houston, and New Mexico, while completing stories for what would be his first collection, Ghost and Flesh: Stories and Tales. About this time his work was being translated into German and French by Ernst Robert Curtius and Maurice Coindreau in Europe, where it remains in print in several languages and where he is highly regarded. In the early 1950s he began to write plays and adaptations of his own works for the stage, and he eventually had several of his plays produced over many years: The Diamond Rattler (1960), Christy (1964), House of Breath Black/White (1971), and Aimee (1973). In 1954 the stage version of his first novel was produced off Broadway, and 1955 saw publication of his second novel, In a Farther Country, which had a hostile reception. During this time he was becoming more involved in the theatre world and traveled back and forth between New York and New Mexico. In 1958 he revised the screenplay and wrote song lyrics for the Paul Newman film, The Left-Handed Gun. A comic novel, The Fair Sister, about two African-American families, was published in 1963, but it was pulled by the publisher after a reviewer in The New York Times Book Review called Goyen \\"insensitive\\". He continued to have difficulty finding publishers and audiences for his work in America. He gave up his own writing when he was an editor with McGraw-Hill, from 1966 to 1971. He would later say about this time in his life: \\"There was no question of my own writing. I was relieved not to have to worry about my own writing.\\" Following a conversion experience in 1971, he published the non- fiction work, A Book of Jesus, in 1973. A biographer later noted: \\"Jesus cost Goyen his editorial job.\\" His fourth novel, Come the Restorer, was published in 1974. This tale about a community's search for a savior Goyen called his \\"biggest accomplishment\\". His limited readership made commercial publishers wary, and even for Arcadio, his final novel, he had to search widely for an interested firm. By this time \\"no one would touch his writing.\\" Arcadio was published two months after his death in 1983. The book concerns a hermaphrodite who, in general terms, is seeking a way to reconcile the warring halves of his/her self. A posthumous publication included Half a Look of Cain: A Fantastical Narrative, which was written in the 1950s and early 1960s and was published in 1998. Style Goyen is considered \\"a writer's writer\\". His East Texas origins and early childhood had an enduring influence on the speech patterns and cultural characteristics reflected in his writings, which are marked by the rhythms of rural speech, the Bible, and a sense of story and place. His style has been compared to Virginia Woolf, William Faulkner, and Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Biographer Peede notes that his works are known \\"for their incantatory passages, their fragmented brilliance, but not their seamless design.\\" Critics have tried to define his style with labels such as Southern, Southern Gothic, modernist, postmodernist, contemporary, and magical realist. But Goyen insisted that his work should be considered outside any genre: \\"I'm really not very interested in contemporary fiction, anyway. I consider my fiction absolutely separate and apart from and unrelated to \\"contemporary American fiction.\\" Themes Recurring themes in Goyen's work include alienation (from self and from the world), isolation, loneliness, home and family, time, memory, spirituality, sexuality, and place. Awards and honors Goyen was the recipient of several awards and fellowships. These include: * Southwest Review Literary Fellowship, 1949 * MacMurray Award for best first novel by a Texan, 1950 * Guggenheim Fellowship, 1952 and 1954 * Ford Foundation grantee, 1963‚Äì64 * Music awards for words and music, the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (A.S.C.A.P.), 1964, 1965, 1968, 1970, and 1971 * Distinguished Alumnus Award, Rice University, 1977 Legacy The importance of Goyen's contribution to literature is not settled. Some critics have argued that he may yet prove to be one of the most distinctive literary voices of the 20th century. His books continued to remain in print in Europe long after they were unavailable in America. In 2001, Doris Roberts established the Doris Roberts-William Goyen Fellowship in Fiction through the Christopher Isherwood Foundation. The monetary award is given annually and intended to support writers who have published at least one book of fiction, either a novel or a collection of stories.

He made two solo transatlantic crossings, one in a sailing dugout canoe made while working in Liberia and the second in a 17-foot Klepper Aerius II double folding kayak, modified to carry two masts and an outrigger. His book Alone at Sea documents the trips, which were totally unassisted. He was motivated to make the trips by an interest in how the human body and mind respond to survival at sea, a theme which the Kon-Tiki (1947) and Alain Bombard (1952) explored in earlier ocean voyages. His kayak was delivered to the Canary Islands, before sailing to the Caribbean. He very rarely paddled, though used a paddle when rudders broke. He carried of supplies, much of it canned comestibles, some of which he ditched on setting out as the kayak was too heavy. He caught fish and gathered rainwater to supplement his rations. The crossing to Saint Maarten took him 72 days. Towards the end of that trip he encountered storms of \\"wind force 8, gusting to force 9\\" when he capsized twice during a period of hallucinations brought on by fatigue and sleep deprivation. At times he described what might be described as tantric or altered states ‚Äì safe in the cocoon of his sodden kayak while storms raged around him for days. He was convinced that in a survival situation the mind gave up long before the body (or indeed the craft), and to help accomplish the second trip he trained himself in sleep deprivation as well as mentally, which he described at times as prayer, meditation, autogenic training and ingraining his sub-conscious with affirmational mottos like \\"I will make it\\" and \\"Keep going west\\". In the light of these experiences, Lindemann concluded that Alain Bombard had been supplied with fresh water and some other food supplies on two occasions, and could not have survived on salt-water and fish, as claimed.https://apaddleinmypack.wordpress.com/2011/06/29/lindemann-and- bombard/ ReferencesExternal links * Deutsches Museum (Bonn) * Ocean Rowing statistics * First Atlantic Crossing in Canoe -Video Newsreel film * Ebook: Alone at Sea Category:1922 births Category:2015 deaths Category:German male canoeists Category:German sailors Category:Sportspeople from Bonn Category:German male writers ","title":"Hannes Lindemann"},{"id":"1880976","text":"propeller of a Bombardier Q400 taken with a digital camera showing the wagon- wheel effect Video of a spinning, patterned paper disc. At a certain speed the sets of spokes appear to slow and rotate in opposite directions. The wagon-wheel effect (alternatively called stagecoach-wheel effect or stroboscopic effect) is an optical illusion in which a spoked wheel appears to rotate differently from its true rotation. The wheel can appear to rotate more slowly than the true rotation, it can appear stationary, or it can appear to rotate in the opposite direction from the true rotation. This last form of the effect is sometimes called the reverse rotation effect. The wagon-wheel effect is most often seen in film or television depictions of stagecoaches or wagons in Western movies, although recordings of any regularly spoked rotating object will show it, such as helicopter rotors, aircraft propellers and car commercials. In these recorded media, the effect is a result of temporal aliasing. It can also commonly be seen when a rotating wheel is illuminated by flickering light. These forms of the effect are known as stroboscopic effects: the original smooth rotation of the wheel is visible only intermittently. A version of the wagon-wheel effect can also be seen under continuous illumination. Under stroboscopic conditions This animated GIF demonstrates the wagon-wheel effect. The speed of the \\"camera\\", moving towards the right, constantly increases at the same rate with the objects sliding to the left. Halfway through the 24-second loop, the objects appear to suddenly shift and head backwards. Stroboscopic conditions ensure that the visibility of a rotating wheel is broken into a series of brief episodes in which its motion is either absent (in the case of movie cameras) or minimal (in the case of stroboscopes), interrupted by longer episodes of invisibility. It is customary to call the former episodes frames. An analog movie camera that records images on filmstock typically operates at 24 frames per second while digital movie cameras operate at 25 frames per second (PAL; European Standards), or at 29.97 frames per second (NTSC; North American Standards). A standard television operates at 59.94 or at 50 images per second (a video frame is two separate images; see interlace). A stroboscope can typically have its frequency set to any value. Artificial lighting that is temporally modulated when powered by alternating current, such as gas discharge lamps (including neon, mercury vapor, sodium vapor and fluorescent tubes), flicker at twice the frequency of the power line (for example 100 times per second on a 50-cycle line). In each cycle of current the power peaks twice (once with positive voltage and once with negative voltage) and twice goes to zero, and the light output varies accordingly. In all of these cases, a person sees a rotating wheel under stroboscopic conditions. Imagine that the true rotation of a four-spoke wheel is clockwise.Maxim, tutorial 928, Filter Basics: Anti-Aliasing http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/928 The first instance of visibility of the wheel may occur when one spoke is at 12 o'clock. If by the time the next instance of visibility occurs, the spoke previously at 9 o'clock has moved into the 12-o'clock position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be stationary. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 11:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating backwards. If at the second instance of visibility, the next spoke has moved to the 12:30 position, then a viewer will perceive the wheel to be rotating forwards, albeit more slowly than the wheel is actually rotating. The effect relies on a motion perception property called beta movement: motion is seen between two objects in different positions in the visual field at different times providing the objects are similar (which is true of spoked wheels‚Äîeach spoke is essentially identical to the others) and providing the objects are close (which is true of the originally 9-o'clock spoke in the second instant‚Äîit is closer to 12 o'clock than the originally 12-o'clock spoke). The wagon-wheel effect is exploited in some engineering tasks, such as adjusting the timing of an engine. This same effect can make some rotating machines, such as lathes, dangerous to operate under artificial lighting because at certain speeds the machines will falsely appear to be stopped or to be moving slowly. Finlay, Dodwell, and Caelli (1984) and Finlay and Dodwell (1987) studied perception of rotating wheels under stroboscopic illumination when the duration of each frame was long enough for observers to see the real rotation. Despite this, the rotation direction was dominated by the wagon- wheel effect. Finlay and Dodwell (1987) argued that there are some critical differences between the wagon-wheel effect and beta movement, but their argument has not troubled the consensus. Under continuous illumination=Effective stroboscopic presentation by vibrating the eyes Rushton (1967) observed the wagon-wheel effect under continuous illumination while humming. The humming vibrates the eyes in their sockets, effectively creating stroboscopic conditions within the eye. By humming at a frequency of a multiple of the rotation frequency, he was able to stop the rotation. By humming at slightly higher and lower frequencies, he was able to make the rotation reverse slowly and to make the rotation go slowly in the direction of rotation. A similar stroboscopic effect is now commonly observed by people eating crunchy foods, such as carrots, while watching TV: the image appears to shimmer. The crunching vibrates the eyes at a multiple of the frame rate of the TV. Besides vibrations of the eyes, the effect can be produced by observing wheels via a vibrating mirror. Rear-view mirrors in vibrating cars can produce the effect. Truly continuous illumination The first to observe the wagon-wheel effect under truly continuous illumination (such as from the sun) was Schouten (1967Schouten, J.F. (1967). Subjective stroboscopy and a model of visual movement detectors. In I. Wathen-Dunn (Ed.), Models for the perception of speech and visual form (pp. 44‚Äì55). Cambridge MA: MIT Press.). He distinguished three forms of subjective stroboscopy which he called alpha, beta, and gamma: Alpha stroboscopy occurs at 8‚Äì12 cycles per second; the wheel appears to become stationary, although \\"some sectors [spokes] look as though they are performing a hurdle race over the standing ones\\" (p. 48). Beta stroboscopy occurs at 30‚Äì35 cycles per second: \\"The distinctness of the pattern has all but disappeared. At times a definite counterrotation is seen of a grayish striped pattern\\" (pp. 48‚Äì49). Gamma stroboscopy occurs at 40‚Äì100 cycles per second: \\"The disk appears almost uniform except that at all sector frequencies a standing grayish pattern is seen ... in a quivery sort of standstill\\" (pp. 49‚Äì50). Schouten interpreted beta stroboscopy, reversed rotation, as consistent with there being Reichardt detectors in the human visual system for encoding motion. Because the spoked wheel patterns he used (radial gratings) are regular, they can strongly stimulate detectors for the true rotation, but also weakly stimulate detectors for the reverse rotation. There are two broad theories for the wagon-wheel effect under truly continuous illumination. The first is that human visual perception takes a series of still frames of the visual scene and that movement is perceived much like a movie. The second is Schouten's theory: that moving images are processed by visual detectors sensitive to the true motion and also by detectors sensitive to opposite motion from temporal aliasing. There is evidence for both theories, but the weight of evidence favours the latter. =Discrete frames theory= Purves, Paydarfar, and Andrews (1996) proposed the discrete-frames theory. One piece of evidence for this theory comes from Dubois and VanRullen (2011). They reviewed experiences of users of LSD who often report that under the influence of the drug a moving object is seen trailing a series of still images behind it. They asked such users to match their drug experiences with movies simulating such trailing images viewed when not under the drug. They found that users selected movies around 15‚Äì20 Hz. This is between Schouten's alpha and beta rates. =Temporal aliasing theory= Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2004) confirmed the observation of reversed rotation with regularly spaced dots on a rotating drum. They called this \\"illusory motion reversal\\". They showed that these occurred only after a long time of viewing the rotating display (from about 30 seconds to as long as 10 minutes for some observers). They also showed that the incidences of reversed rotation were independent in different parts of the visual field. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering the entire visual scene. Kline, Holcombe, and Eagleman (2006) also showed that reversed rotation of a radial grating in one part of the visual field was independent of superimposed orthogonal motion in the same part of the visual field. The orthogonal motion was of a circular grating contracting so as to have the same temporal frequency as the radial grating. This is inconsistent with discrete frames covering local parts of visual scene. Kline et al. concluded that the reverse rotations were consistent with Reichardt detectors for the reverse direction of rotation becoming sufficiently active to dominate perception of the true rotation in a form of rivalry. The long time required to see the reverse rotation suggests that neural adaptation of the detectors responding to the true rotation has to occur before the weakly stimulated reverse- rotation detectors can contribute to perception. Some small doubts about the results of Kline et al. (2004) sustain adherents of the discrete-frame theory. These doubts include Kline et al.'s finding in some observers more instances of simultaneous reversals from different parts of the visual field than would be expected by chance, and finding in some observers differences in the distribution of the durations of reversals from that expected by a pure rivalry process (Rojas, Carmona-Fontaine, L√≥pez-Calder√≥n, & Aboitiz, 2006). In 2008, Kline and Eagleman demonstrated that illusory reversals of two spatially overlapping motions could be perceived separately, providing further evidence that illusory motion reversal is not caused by temporal sampling. They also showed that illusory motion reversal occurs with non-uniform and non-periodic stimuli (for example, a spinning belt of sandpaper), which also cannot be compatible with discrete sampling. Kline and Eagleman proposed instead that the effect results from a \\"motion during-effect\\", meaning that a motion after- effect becomes superimposed on the real motion. Dangers Because of the illusion this can give to moving machinery, it is advised that single-phase lighting be avoided in workshops and factories. For example, a factory that is lit from a single-phase supply with basic fluorescent lighting will have a flicker of twice the mains frequency, either at 100 or 120 Hz (depending on country); thus, any machinery rotating at multiples of this frequency may appear to not be turning. Seeing that the most common types of AC motors are locked to the mains frequency, this can pose a considerable hazard to operators of lathes and other rotating equipment. Solutions include deploying the lighting over a full 3-phase supply, or by using high-frequency controllers that drive the lights at safer frequencies. Traditional incandescent light bulbs, which employ filaments that glow continuously with only a minor modulation, offer another option as well, albeit at the expense of increased power consumption. Smaller incandescent lights can be used as task lighting on equipment to help combat this effect to avoid the cost of operating larger quantities of incandescent lighting in a workshop environment.

Use in education Since its inception in 1998 at Argonne National Laboratory, the Internet2 initiative known as the Access Grid (a large-format presentation, video conferencing and interactive environment) has used backchannel communications to permit the node operators to pass URLs for display at another site, troubleshoot problems and even discuss what's for lunch at their location. The Access Grid backchannel has evolved from the use of a MOO to XMPP. In 2009 Purdue University developed a tool called Hotseat that enabled students to comment on the course lectures in near real-time using social networking tools such as Facebook and Twitter. Using a backchannel for educational purposes can function as a formal class activity or even an independent discussion without instructor participation and awareness. Aside from the normal discussion, a backchannel can also be used for note taking, asking questions, offering suggestions on different topics, and sharing resources with other students and faculty members. There are many different media networks out there that can be used as a backchannel. Including Twitter, Facebook, Yammer and Instant Messaging. Experiments Joichi Ito's HeckleBot includes an LED text panel displaying phrases sent from the chat room to catch the attention of the speaker or audience. The USC Interactive Media Division has experimented with \\"Google Jockeys\\" to feed visual information and search results between the speakers and the backchannel, projected on multiple screens surrounding their seminars. Software like SubEthaEdit allows for more formal backchannel: collaborative notetaking. In 2007 the Building Learning Communities Conference in Boston, Massachusetts used tools such as Twitter and Skype to create backchannels that included participants who were not on location and at times in remote parts of the world. At times presenters were not aware of the backchannel and other occasions the presenters themselves were involved in the backchannel. ReferencesFurther reading * Cliff Atkinson.

And while no two mission complexes are identical, they all employed the same basic building style. Site selection and layout Mission San Luis Rey de Francia in Oceanside, California. This mission is architecturally distinctive because of the strong combination of Spanish, Moorish, and Mexican lines exhibited. Although the missions were considered temporary ventures by the Spanish hierarchy, the development of an individual settlement was not simply a matter of \\"priestly whim.\\" The founding of a mission followed longstanding rules and procedures; the paperwork involved required months, sometimes years of correspondence, and demanded the attention of virtually every level of the bureaucracy.Johnson, p. 5 Once empowered to erect a mission in a given area, the men assigned to it chose a specific site that featured a good water supply, plenty of wood for fires and building material, and ample fields for grazing herds and raising crops. The padres blessed the site, and with the aid of their military escort fashioned temporary shelters out of tree limbs or driven stakes, roofed with thatch or reeds. It was these simple huts that would ultimately give way to the stone and adobe buildings which exist to this day. A plan view of the Mission San Juan Capistrano complex (including the footprint of the \\"Great Stone Church\\") prepared by architectural historian Rexford Newcomb in 1916.Newcomb, p. 15 The first priority when beginning a settlement was the location and construction of the church (iglesia). The majority of mission sanctuaries were oriented on a roughly east‚Äìwest axis to take the best advantage of the sun's position for interior illumination; the exact alignment depended on the geographic features of the particular site.Baer, p. 42; Mendoza, p. 7 Once the spot for the church was selected, its position would be marked and the remainder of the mission complex would be laid out. The priests' quarters, refectory, convento, workshops, kitchens, soldiers' and servants' living quarters, storerooms, and other ancillary chambers were usually grouped around a walled, open court or patio (often in the form of a quadrangle) inside which religious celebrations and other festive events often took place. The cuadr√°ngulo was rarely a perfect square because the Fathers had no surveying instruments at their disposal and simply measured off all dimensions by foot. In the event of an attack by hostile forces the mission's inhabitants could take refuge within the quadrangle. The basic, common elements found in all of the Alta California missions can be summarized as follows:Newcomb, p. ix * Arched corridors; * Curved, pedimented gables; * Terraced bell towers (with domes and lanterns) or bell walls (pierced belfries); * Wide, projecting eaves; * Broad, undecorated wall surfaces; and * Low, sloping tile roofs. The Alta California missions as a whole do not incorporate the same variety or elaborateness of detail in their design exhibited in the structures erected by Spanish settlers in Arizona, Texas, and Mexico during the same T.V period; nevertheless, they \\"...stand as concrete reminders of Spanish occupation and admirable examples of buildings conceived in the style and manner appropriate to the country in which they were built.\\"Newcomb, p. vii Some fanciful accounts regarding the construction of the missions claimed that tunnels were incorporated into garden the design, to be used as a means of emergency egress in the event of attack; however, no historical evidence (written or physical) has ever been uncovered to support these wild assertions.Engelhardt 1920, pp. 350‚Äì351. One such hypothesis was put forth by author by Prent Duel in his 1919 work Mission Architecture as Exemplified in San Xavier Del Bac: \\"'Most missions of early date possessed secret passages as a means of escape in case they were besieged. It is difficult to locate any of them now as they are well mean.\\" Building materials The three-bell campanario (\\"bell wall\\") at Mission San Juan Bautista. Two of the bells were salvaged from the original chime, which was destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. The scarcity of imported materials, together with a lack of skilled laborers, compelled the Fathers to employ simple building materials and methods in the construction of mission structures. Since importing the quantity of materials necessary for a large mission complex was impossible, the padres had to gather the materials they needed from the land around them. Five basic materials we used sexucting the permanent mission structures: adobe, timber, stone, brick, and tile.Crump, p. 7 Adobes (mud bricks) were made from a combination of earth and water, with chaff, straw, or manure added to bind the mixture together. Occasionally pieces of bricks or shells were placed in the mix to improve the cohesiveness.Crump, p. 8 The soil used may have been clay, loam, or sandy or gravelly earth. The making of the bricks was a simple process, derived from methods originally developed in Spain and Mexico. A convenient, level spot was chosen near the intended building site and close to a suitable water supply (usually a spring or creek). The ground was dug up and soaked with water, whereupon bare-legged workers would stomp the wet earth and binders into a homogeneous consistency fit for carrying to, and placing in, the brick molds. The mixture was compressed into the wooden formas, which were arranged in rows, and leveled by hand to the top of the frame. From time to time, a worker would leave an imprint of his hand or foot on the surface of a wet brick, or perhaps a literate workman would inscribe his name and the date on the face. When the forms were filled, the bricks were left in the sun to dry. Great care was taken to expose the bricks on all sides, in order to ensure uniform drying and prevent cracking. Once dry, the bricks were stacked in rows to await their use. California adobes measured , were thick, and weighed , making them convenient to carry and easy to handle during the construction process.Egenhoff, p. 149 skulls and crossbones were often used to mark the entrances to Spanish cemeteries (campos santos). Here, at Mission Santa Barbara, stone carvings were substituted. Facilities for milling lumber were almost non-existent: workers used stone axes and crude saws to shape the wood, and often used logs which only had their bark stripped from them. These methods gave mission structures their distinctive appearance. Timber was used to reinforce walls, as vigas (beams) to support roofs, and as forms for door and window openings and arches. Since most of the settlements were located in valleys or coastal plains almost totally devoid of suitably large trees, the padres were in most cases limited to pine, alder, poplar, cypress and juniper trees for use in their construction efforts. Indians used wooden carrettas, drawn by oxen, to haul timber from as much as forty miles away (as was the case at Mission San Miguel Arc√°ngel). At Mission San Luis Rey, however, the ingenious Father Lasu√©n instructed his neophyte workers to float logs downriver from Palomar Mountain to the mission site.Camphouse, p. 33 The lack of good-sized timber forced the men to design mission buildings that were long and narrow. For example, the widest inside dimensions of any of the mission buildings (at San Carlos, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz) is : the narrowest, at Mission Soledad, spans . The longest structure, at Mission Santa Barbara, stretches .Johnson, p. 24 Stone (piedra) was used as a construction material whenever possible. In the absence of skilled stonemasons, the inexperienced builders resorted to the use of sandstone; though easier to cut, it was not as weather-resistant as that which would have been used by skilled artisans. To bind the stones together, the priests and Indians followed the (Mexican) Pre- Columbian technique of using mud mortar, since mortar made from lime was unavailable to them. Colored stones and pebbles were added to the mud mixture, giving it \\"a beautiful and interesting texture.\\"Johnson, p. 26 The chapel at Mission San Gabriel Arc√°ngel was designed by Father Antonio Cruzado who hailed from C√≥rdoba, Spain which accounts for the Mission's strong Moorish influence. Ladrillos (conventional bricks) were manufactured in much the same manner as adobes, with one important difference: after forming and initial drying, the bricks were fired in outdoor kilns to ensure a much greater endurance than could be achieved through merely sun-drying them. Common bricks typically measured ten inches (250 mm) square and were thick. Square paving bricks were equal in thickness to the common variety, but ranged from across.Egenhoff, p. 156 Many of the structures erected with this type of brick remained standing long after their adobe counterparts had been reduced to rubble. The earliest structures had roofs of thatch or earth supported by flat poles. Tejas (roof tiles) were utilized in later construction (beginning around 1790) to replace the flammable thatch. The semicircular tiles consisted of clay molded over a section of a log was which well-sanded to prevent the clay from sticking. According to the accounts of Father Est√©van Tap√≠s of Mission Santa Barbara, some thirty-two Native American males were required to make 500 tiles each day, while the women carried sand and straw to the pits.Webb, p. 108 The mixture was first worked in pits under the hoofs of animals, then placed on a flat board and fashioned to the correct thickness. Sheets of clay were then placed over the logs and cut the desired to size: they ranged in length from , and tapered from in width. After trimming, the tiles were dried in the sun, then placed in ovens and burned until they took on a reddish-brown coloring.Egenhoff, p. 162 The quality of the tiles varied greatly among the missions due to differences in soil types from one site to another. Legend has it that the first tiles were made at Mission San Luis Obispo, but Father Maynard Geiger (the Franciscan historian and biographer of Jun√≠pero Serra) claims that Mission San Antonio de Padua was actually the first to use them.Crump, p. 17 Aside from their obvious advantage over straw roofs in terms of fire retardance, the impermeable surface also protected the adobe walls below from the damaging effects of rain. The original tiles were secured with a dab of adobe and were held in place because of their shape, being tapered at the upper end so they could not slide off one another. Construction methods The earliest projects had a layer of streambed stones arranged as a foundation, upon which the adobes were placed. Later, stone and masonry were used for foundation courses, which greatly added to the bearing capacity of the brickwork.Baer, p. 22 Aside from superficial leveling, no other ground preparation was done before construction started. There is some evidence to indicate that the initial structures at some of the outposts were produced by setting wooden posts close together and filling the interstitial spaces with clay.Baer, p. 23 At completion, the building would be covered with a thatched roof and wall surfaces would be coated with whitewash to keep the clay exterior from eroding. This type of construction is known as \\"wattle and daub\\" (jacal to the natives) and eventually gave way to the use of adobe, stone, or ladrillos. Even though many of the adobe structures were ultimately replaced with ones of piedra or brick, adobe was still employed extensively and was the principal material used in building the missions as there was an almost universal lack of readily-available stone. The adobes were laid in courses and cemented together with wet clay. Due to the low bearing strength of adobe and the lack of skilled brick masons (alba√±ils), walls made of mud bricks had to be fairly thick. The width of a wall depended mostly on its height: low walls were commonly two feet thick, while the highest (up to thirty-five feet) required as much as six feet of material to support them.Crump, p. 24 Timbers were set into the upper courses of most walls to stiffen them. Massive exterior buttresses were also employed to fortify wall sections (see the photo at right), but this method of reinforcement required the inclusion of pilasters on the inside of the building to resist the lateral thrust of the buttresses and prevent the collapse of the wall. Pilasters and buttresses were often composed of more durable baked brick, even when the walls they supported were adobe. When the walls got too high for workers on the ground to reach the top, simple wood scaffolding was erected from whatever lumber was available. Many times posts were temporarily cemented into the walls to support catwalks. When the wall was completed, the posts were removed and the voids filled with adobe, or were sometimes sawed off flush with the surface of the wall.Johnson, p. 50 A look inside the reconstructed (half-size) chapel at Mission Santa Cruz in December 2004. Note the exposed wood beams that comprise the roof structure. The Spaniards had various types of rudimentary hoists and cranes at their disposal for lifting materials to the men working on top of a structure. These machines were fashioned out of wood and rope, and were usually similar in configuration to a ship's rigging. In fact, sailors were often employed in mission construction to apply their knowledge of maritime rigging to the handling of loads.Johnson, p. 52 It is not apparent as to whether or not the padres used pulleys in their lifting devices, but these instruments nevertheless got the job done. Unless adobes were protected from the elements they would eventually dissolve into nothing more than heaps of mud. Most adobe walls, therefore, were either whitewashed or stuccoed inside and out. Whitewash was a mixture of lime and water which was brushed on the interior surfaces of partition walls; stucco was a longer-lasting, viscous blend of aggregate (in this case, sand) and whitewash, applied to the faces of load- bearing walls with a paleta (trowel). Usually the face of a wall that was to receive stucco would be scored so that the mixture would adhere better, or laborers would press bits of broken tile or small stones into the wet mortar to provide a varied surface for the stucco to cling to.Baer, p. 27 Once erection of the walls was completed, assembly of the roof could commence. The flat or gabled roofs were held up by square, evenly-spaced wood beams, which carried the weight of the roof and ceiling (if one was present). In the sanctuaries it was common for beams to be decorated with painted designs. Vigas rested on wood corbels, which were built into the walls and often projected on the outside of the building.Baer, p. 28 When the rafters were in place a thatch of tules (brush) was woven over them for insulation, and were in turn covered with clay tiles. The tiles were cemented to the roof with mortar, clay, or brea (tar or bitumen). At some of the missions the padres were able to hire professional stonemasons to assist them in their endeavors; in 1797, for example, master mason Isidoro Agu√≠lar was brought in from Culiac√°n, Mexico to supervise the building of a stone church at San Juan Capistrano.Camphouse, p. 30 The church, constructed mostly of sandstone, featured a vaulted ceiling and seven domes. Indians had to gather thousands of stones from miles around for this venture, transporting them in carrettas or carrying them by hand. This structure, nicknamed \\"Serra's Church\\" once had a l20-foot-tall bell tower that was almost totally destroyed by in 1812.Chase and Saunders, p. 27 Architectural historian Rexford Newcomb sketched this pair of doors, which display the Spanish \\"River of Life\\" pattern, at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a in 1916.Newcomb, p. 65 Arched door and window openings required the use of wood centering during erection, as did corridor arches and any type of vault or domed construction. Windows were kept small and to a minimum, and placed high on walls as a protective measure in case of Indian attack. A few of the missions had imported glass window panes, but most made do with oiled skins stretched tightly across the openings.Baer, p. 32 Windows were the only source of interior illumination at the missions, other than the tallow candles made in the outposts' workshops. Doors were made of wood cut into planks at the carpinter√≠a, and most often bore the Spanish \\"River of Life\\" pattern or other carved or painted designs. Carpenters used a ripsaw (or \\"pitsaw\\") to saw logs into thin boards, which were held together by ornate nails forged in the mission's blacksmith shop. Nails, especially long ones, were scarce throughout California, so large members (such as rafters or beams) which had to be fastened together were tied with rawhide strips.Johnson, p. 68 Connections of this type were common in post and lintel construction, such as that found over corridors. Aside from nails, blacksmiths fashioned iron gates, crosses, tools, kitchen utensils, cannons for mission defense, and other objects needed by the mission community. Settlements had to rely on cargo ships and trade for their iron supplies as they did not have the capability to mine and process iron ore. Architectural elements A close-up view of the pediment situated above the chapel entrance at Mission Santa Barbara and its unique ornamental frieze. Since they were not trained in building design, the padres could only try to emulate the architectural aspects of structures they remembered from their homeland. The missions exhibit a strong Roman influence in much of their design and construction techniques (as do many buildings in Spain), particularly in arch and dome construction. At Mission Santa Barbara, founding Father Ripali even went so far as to consult the works of 1st century B.C. Roman architect Vitruvius during the design phase of the project.Camphouse, p. 70 In addition to the domes, vaults, and arches, and the Roman building methods used to create them, the missions inherited several architectural features from mother Spain. One of the most important design elements of a mission was its church belfry, of which there were four distinct types: the basic belfry, the espada√±a, the campanile, and the campanario. The basic belfry was merely a bell hanging from a beam which was supported by two upright posts. The belfry usually stood just to one side of the main entrance to the church. The second type, the espada√±a, was a raised gable at the end of a church building, usually curved and decorated; it did not always contain bells, however, but was sometimes added to the building simply to give it a more impressive facade. The campanile, probably the most well-known bell support, was a large tower which held one or more bells; these were usually domed structures, and some even had lanterns atop them. The final method for hanging bells is the campanario, which consists of a wall with openings for the bells. Most walls were attached to the sanctuary building, save for the one at the Pala Asistencia which is a standalone structure. The campanario is unique in that it is native to Alta California. A view looking down a typical exterior corridor at Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. Other notable aspects of the missions were the long arcades (corridors) which flanked all interior and many exterior walls. The arches were Roman (half-round), while the pillars were usually square and made of baked brick, rather than adobe. The overhang created by the arcade had a dual function: it provided a comfortable, shady place to sit after a hard-day's work, and (more importantly) it kept rainfall away from the adobe walls. The mainstay of any mission complex was its capilla (chapel). The design of chapels overall followed that of Christian churches in Europe, but tended to be comparatively long and narrow due to the size of lumber available along the California coast. Each church had a main section (the nave), a baptistry near the front entrance, a sanctuary (where the altar was located), and a sacristy at the back of the church where materials used to celebrate Mass were stored and where the priests vested. In most churches, a stairway near the main entrance led up to a choir loft. Decorations were usually copied from books and applied by native artists. The religious designs and paintings are said to \\"show the flavor of the Spanish Era, mixed with the primitive touch of the Indian artists.\\"Baer, p. 50 The impact that mission architecture has had on the modern buildings of California is readily apparent in the many civic, commercial, and residential structures which exhibit the tile roofs, arched door and window openings, and stuccoed walls that typify the \\"mission look.\\" These elements are frequently included in the exterior finish of modern buildings in California and the Southwest, and are commonly referred to as Mission Revival Style architecture. The inclusion of these features in whole or part into otherwise ordinary commercial buildings has been met with varying levels of acceptance, and is regarded among some critics as \\"mission impossible\\", a phenomenon that is seen most brashly in the fast food emporiums of Taco Bell. When well-done, a mission style building will convey an impression of simplicity, permanence, and comfort, with coolness in the heat of the day and warmth in the cold of night (due to a phenomenon known as the thermal flywheel effect). Infrastructure Stone aqueducts, sometimes spanning miles, brought fresh water from a river or spring to the mission site. Baked clay pipes, joined with lime mortar or bitumen, carried the water into reservoirs and gravity-fed fountains, and emptied into waterways where the force of the water would be used to turn grinding wheels, presses, and other simple machinery. Water brought to the mission proper would be used for cooking, cleaning, irrigation of crops, and drinking. Drinking water was allowed to trickle through alternate layers of sand and charcoal to remove the impurities. Furniture Mission Carmel's campanile (\\"bell tower\\") as seen from the central courtyard in June 2004. Influenced by early mission furnishings, \\"mission oak\\" furniture bears some similarity to the related Arts and Crafts style furniture, using similar materials but without Arts and Crafts' emphasis on refinement of line and decoration. Oak is the typical material, finished with its natural golden appearance that will age to a rich medium brown color. Components such as legs will often be straight, not tapered, and surfaces will be flat, rather than curved. Generous use of materials leads to heavy and solid furnishings, giving an impression of \\"groundedness\\", through simplicity, functionality and stability. Straightforward lines predominate, with little or no decoration, other than that which is incidental to function, such as forged iron hinges and latches. The leading designer of furnishings in this style during the Arts and Crafts movement was Gustav Stickley. NotesReferences  * Egenhoff, E., ed.

The film was based on a 1979 novel of the same name by Peter Benchley who also wrote the screenplay. It is about a savage group of pirates, made up of outcasts, thieves, and murderers, who are hidden from the outside world by an uncharted Caribbean island, and who have raided boats to sustain themselves, since the 18th century. Plot Blair Maynard is a British-born American journalist who was once in the Navy and who decides to investigate the mystery of why so many boats disappear in the Bermuda Triangle of the Caribbean. He takes his estranged son Justin with him to the area on the \\"vacation\\" and, while fishing, both are attacked by an unkempt man and forcibly brought to an uncharted island. On the island, Blair discovers that the inhabitants of the island are a centuries-old colony of savage French pirates. The group has been living on the island for centuries, unseen by society, and sustain themselves by raiding pleasure boats. The pirates kill whoever comes to the island; however, Blair and his son are both kept alive due to a false assumption regarding their lineage and a need to offset the negative effects of inbreeding. Blair is used to impregnate a female and act as a scribe for the largely illiterate group, while Justin is brainwashed to become a surrogate heir to Nau, the pirate leader. Blair struggles to escape from the island, but all attempts fail. Blair begins his captivity as a very peaceable and civilized everyman, but he is helpless in the absence of law and the presence of the almost unlimited violence the pirates commit. Subjecting him to constant fear and abuse, the pirates fail to realize how desperate Blair is becoming as his repeated escape attempts continually fail. He eventually arranges for the pirates to come head to head with a US Coast Guard ship, but they manage to wipe out the crew and take over the vessel. Blair sneaks aboard and, while most of the pirates are gathered on the aft deck of the ship, he discovers a deck-mounted M2 Machine Gun hidden underneath a tarp. He opens fire on the pirates, and continues to fire even after they are all dead. He then learns that Nau was not on the deck. The two men then stalk each other through various parts of the decimated vessel. Blair eventually gets the upper hand and kills Nau with a flare gun. Blair and his son, who no longer desires to be a pirate and seems much more respectful of his father, are reunited.

These are Miss World, Miss Universe, Miss International and Miss Earth. Colour Key  Representative to Miss Universe  Representative to Miss World  Representative to Miss International  Representative to Miss Earth = Fatwa ruling in Malaysia  In Malaysia, female Muslims were denied participation in beauty pageants following the issue of a fatwa in 1996 by the Mufti of Selangor, Ishak Baharom. The issue came to a nasty twist in July - September 1997 when four Malay participants joined the Miss Malaysian petite contest, only to be arrested by the authorities. In the ensuing public outcry and debate that followed, the effectiveness of the fatwa was shown given the influence of the Selangor's Mufti over the nation's sharia law. The fatwa resonated with the ideology that Muslim women should cover up private parts of their body, or Aurat of which the beauty pageants' practices ran contrary to - even though such religious enactments also apply to male pageants. In Kuala Lumpur on 21 July 2013, the organisers of Miss Malaysia World 2013 were forced to drop four of its Muslim finalists following a fatwa prohibiting Muslim women from joining beauty pageants. According to Wan Zahidi, the fatwa prohibiting Muslim women from joining beauty pageants was issued and gazetted under the Federal Territories Islamic Administration Act in February 1996. In recent years, the National Fatwa Council, the country's highest Islamic body, had also issued rulings forbidding Muslims from using Botox and banned women from exhibiting tomboy behaviour, which it defined as behaving or dressing like men or taking part in lesbian sex. The council came under heavy scrutiny for its proposal to ban yoga after a university lecturer advised people to stop practising it for fear that it could deviate from the teachings of Islam. The move was met with protests from progressive Muslim women's groups like Sisters in Islam who deemed the fatwas regressive while observers claimed it highlighted the worrying trend of overt Islamisation in Malaysia. The four contestants are: # Wafa Johanna de Korte, 19, Kuala Lumpur # Sara Amellia Bernard, 20, Perak # Miera Sheikh, 19, Malacca # Kathrina Binti Ridzuan, 24, Kuala Lumpur Nevertheless, a public outcry ensued, as members of the public questioned the way the religious authorities handled the matter as well as the abrupt ruling which came about ‚Äì Muslim women in the past had participated in beauty pageants without much protest amongst the religious authorities. This invoked the concerns of Mahathir's who had raised objections to the way the religious authorities had implemented and enforced the law ‚Äì and questions including distinctions on religious laws and personal freedom were raised. Nevertheless, the fatwa ruling has since been very effective; Muslim women have since then been deterred from joining any beauty pageants. Malaysian beauty pageants, in compliance with the law, similarly denied Muslim individuals from participating. However, Muslim women may still join smaller scale beauty pageant contests such as Dewi Remaja, Miss Intercontinental, and Miss Tourism, provided that they don't display publicly wearing swimsuits.

These dependencies were often called \\"protectorates\\" or \\"trucial states\\". By this system, the day-to-day government and administration of areas both small and large were left in the hands of traditional rulers, who gained prestige and the stability and protection afforded by the Pax Britannica (in the case of British territories), at the cost of losing control of their external affairs, and often of taxation, communications, and other matters, usually with a small number of European \\"advisors\\" effectively overseeing the government of large numbers of people spread over extensive areas.The American Historical Association. \\"ENGLAND'S INDIRECT RULE IN ITS AFRICAN COLONIES\\" in THROUGH THE LENS OF HISTORY: BIAFRA, NIGERIA, THE WEST AND THE WORLD.

In 1890 Zanzibar became a protectorate (not a colony) of Britain. Prime minister Salisbury explained his position: :The condition of a protected dependency is more acceptable to the half civilized races, and more suitable for them than direct dominion. It is cheaper, simpler, less wounding to their self-esteem, gives them more career as public officials, and spares of unnecessary contact with white men.Andrew Roberts, Salisbury: Victorian Titan (1999) p 529 The Princely States of India were ruled indirectly.Lakshmi Iyer, \\"Direct versus indirect colonial rule in India: Long-term consequences.\\" The Review of Economics and Statistics (2010) 92#4 pp: 693-713 online . So too was much of the West African holdings.Adiele Eberechukwu Afigbo, The Warrant Chiefs: indirect rule in southeastern Nigeria, 1891-1929 (London: Longman, 1972) In Africa The ideological underpinnings, as well as the practical application, of indirect rule in Uganda and Nigeria is usually traced to the work of Frederick Lugard, the High Commissioner of the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria from 1899 to 1906. Indirect rule was by no means a new idea at the time, for it had been in use in ruling empires throughout history. For instance, in addition to India and Uganda, it had been practiced in the Songhai and Ashanti empires. In the lands of the Sokoto Caliphate, conquered by the British Empire at the turn of the century, Lugard instituted a system whereby external, military, and tax control was operated by the British, while most every other aspect of life was left to local pre-British aristocracies who may have sided with the British during or after their conquest. The theory behind this solution to a very practical problem (a problem referred to as 'The Native Problem' by Mahmood Mamdani in his work Citizen and Subject) of domination by a tiny group of foreigners of huge populations is laid out in Lugard's influential work, The Dual Mandate in British Tropical Africa. Lugard copied the numerous empires before his time who had created and developed the indirect rule system. he is only noted for the ruling system because he first published a book about this system of administration called ‚ÄúThe Dual Mandate in Tropical Africa,‚Äù According to the British, Indirect Rule was a political doctrine which held that the Europeans and Africans were culturally different to this extent, Africans had to be ruled through the Africans own institution. To achieve this objective: * Chiefs and or Royalty continued to exercise their traditional powers over their subjects; * Chiefs were appointed for areas with no chiefs; and * Aspects of traditional government repugnant to ‚ÄúEuropean ideas of what constituted government were modified.‚Äù e.g. the abolition of human sacrifice. But the truth and fact is that African scholars have recently refuted the British reasons adduced to explain the underlying reason for the introduction of indirect rule. Contrary to the British conception, it has been contended that the main reason was economic and not differences in culture. It has been pointed out that the British were not prepared to pay for colonial administration, though interested in exploiting the colonies; neither had got enough resources to finance it. This economic question coupled with the shortage of or lack of White personnel in Africa at the time convinced the British that it would be cheaper to use the traditional institutions to achieve the same objective. The nature and operation of Indirect rule in Northern Nigerian, amply confirm these contentions. When Lord Lugard conquered the Sokoto Caliphate of Northern Nigeria, in early twentieth century, his limited resources in terms of men and money, made it impracticable for him to rule that vast territory. Fortunately for him, however, the Sokoto Caliphate already possessed a highly developed and efficient system of administration headed by emirs, with the Sultan of Sokoto as the supreme head. The hierarchical nature of the political structure was ideal for Indirect Rule because the British could control the emirs and the emirs in turn could control their people.Dr. Ofosu-Mensah Ababio Ofosu-Mensah E.A. Gold Mining in Adanse: pre-colonial and modern. Sarbrucken: Lambert Academic Publising, 2014 Practical implementation Naaba Koom II, king of the Mossi in French Upper Volta, pictured in 1930. Preservation of precolonial political units was the basis of indirect rule in British and French empires Indirect rule was cheaper and easier for the European powers and, in particular, it required fewer administrators, but had a number of problems. In many cases, European authorities empowered local traditional leaders, as in the case of the monarchy of Uganda, but if no suitable leader could be found (in the traditional Western sense of the term), the Europeans would simply choose local rulers to suit them.Eric J. Hobsbawm, Terence O. Ranger, 'The Invention of Tradition' (1983) This was the case in Kenya and Southern Nigeria, and the new leaders, often called \\"warrant chiefs\\", were not always supported by the local population. The European ruling classes also often chose local leaders with similar traits to their own, despite these traits not being suited to native leadership. Many were conservative elders, and thus indirect rule fostered a conservative outlook among the indigenous population and marginalised the young intelligentsia. Written laws, which replaced oral laws, were less flexible to the changing social nature, old customs of retribution and justice were removed or banned, and the removal of more violent punishments in some areas led to an increase in crime. Furthermore, leaders empowered by the governments of European powers were often not familiar with their new tasks, such as recruitment and tax.Collins and Burns, pp. 297-308 Interpretations From the early 20th century, French and British writers helped establish a dichotomy between British Indirect rule, exemplified by the Indian princely states and by Lord Lugard's writings on the administration of northern Nigeria, and French colonial direct rule.

French rule, sometimes labeled Jacobin, was said in these writings to be based on the twin ideologies of the centralized unitary French government of the Metropole, with the French colonial ideology of Assimilation. Colonial Assimilation argued that French law and citizenship was based on universal values that came from the French Revolution. Mirroring French domestic citizenship law, French colonial law allowed for anyone who could prove themselves culturally French (the \\"√âvolu√©s\\") to become equal French citizens.Erik Bleich, 'The legacies of history?

It is considered a premier shopping and dining district on the Westside and draws crowds from all over the Greater Los Angeles area. Due to easy access to Downtown Los Angeles via the Big Blue Bus rapid transit service, E Line's terminus station and the Pacific Coast Highway-Santa Monica Freeway Interstate, the neighborhood's north-south thoroughfares connecting to Muscle Beach, Venice Canal Historic District, Marina del Rey, Ballona Wetlands and Los Angeles International Airport, and its proximity to historic U.S. Route 66, Santa Monica Pier, Palisades Park, Tongva Park, Santa Monica State Beach and the Pacific Ocean coupled with Los Angeles's mild mediterranean climate, it is also a popular tourist destination.  History  Third Street has been a center of business in Santa Monica since the town's inception in the late 19th century. The Promenade's roots date back to November 8, 1965 when three blocks of Third Street were converted into a pedestrian mall. Although successful, by the late 1970s, the Santa Monica Mall (as it was then called), was in need of modernization and a redesign. A new enclosed shopping center, Santa Monica Place (1980‚Äì2007), designed by Frank Gehry was added at the Promenade's southern end. A citywide bond measure was issued and architectural firm ROMA Design Group was hired to redesign Santa Monica Mall. The renamed Third Street Promenade opened on September 16, 1989. The project was part of a larger redevelopment effort, encompassing several blocks of Downtown Santa Monica. Santa Monica Place has since been renovated into a new open-air shopping and dining venue that re-opened on August 6, 2010. The Third Street Promenade and Downtown Santa Monica are overseen by Downtown Santa Monica, Inc. (formerly Bayside District Corporation), a private non-profit 501(c)(3) that works with the City of Santa Monica to manage services and operations in Downtown Santa Monica that promote economic stability, growth and community life within Downtown Santa Monica.  Features = Public art  A central feature of the Third Street Promenade are the public art topiary sculptures and fountains The Dinosaurs of Santa Monica by the French team Les Lalanne. Located along three blocks of the Third Street Promenade, the dinosaur topiaries \\"spew\\" streams of water from their mouths. Surrounding the Third Street Promenade are several multi-level parking structures developed in tandem with the Promenade's 1989 renovation. These parking structures contain exterior building-mounted sculptures, exterior building-mounted murals, and interior murals by artists such as Gilbert Lujan, Art Mortimer, Peter Shire, Cliff Garden, Ball-Nogues Studio, and Anne Marie Karlsen,  Entertainment  Community sentiment and feedback during the 1989 planning phase expressed strong desire for public gathering space and \\"outdoor living room\\" space. The redevelopment plans took this to heart and designed the public space for public life, shopping and entertainment. Street performers and entertainers are a frequent sight on the street. On a typical Saturday night in the summer, singer-songwriters, classical guitar players, magicians, clowns, hip-hop dancers, lounge singers, session drummers, and other artists line up approximately to apart from each other all along Third Street.

Development WIST-94 was designed at Military Institute of Armament Technology (WITU) under the code name Piryt (Pyrite in Polish). Two prototypes were made in 1992, which differ in the barrel locking system: Model A01 used a rotary-locking system and Model B01 using conventional, Browning-type tilting barrel locking. B01 was the only one to complete testing but the development was temporarily halted due to the military cutting off funding. Financed by WITU and Prexer company, the project continued and in 1994 a new prototype was developed. Called WIST-94 it is based on the B01 prototype. The new pistol was chosen by the Polish military as its new standard sidearm. Design details The WIST-94 is a semi-automatic pistol chambered for 9mm Parabellum round. It uses the Browning cam-lug system of operation. The polygonal-rifled barrel is locked to the slide by three locking lugs machined into the upper part of the barrel. The frame is made from polymer plastic while the slide is constructed from steel. The trigger mechanism is similar to the one used in Glock pistols: striker-fired double-action-only. After racking the slide back and after each shot fired the striker is held semi-cocked allowing for lighter trigger pull than conventional double-action. The only safety used is an internal automatic firing pin safety that unlocks the firing pin only in the final stages of the trigger pull. The WIST-94 is fed by a 16-round magazine. The magazine release catch is reversible for use by left-handed shooters. The slide release lever is located at the left side of the gun. The sights are fixed and have self- luminous tritium inserts for low-light situations. The WIST-94L is also equipped with a laser sight mounted in the upper part of trigger guard. The name of the hand gun sounds, in Polish, very similar to Vis. Variants WIST-94L variant *WIST-94 - basic version *WIST-94L - version with integral laser sights Users WIST-94 pistol has started entering service with the Polish army in 1997. 20,000 pistols were ordered and built\\"≈ªo≈Çnierze, z wyjƒÖtkiem jednostek specjalnych, sƒÖ uzbrojeni w trzy typy pistolet√≥w polskiej produkcji: P-64 Czak i P-83 Wanad (oba na amunicjƒô 9x18 mm Makarow) oraz WIST-94 na natowskƒÖ amunicjƒô 9x19 mm Parabellum.
