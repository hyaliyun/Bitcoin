The term was created by the American anthropologist Michael Agar. Meaning Agar used the term \\"languaculture\\" for the first time in his book Language Shock: Understanding the culture of conversation. Languaculture is a supposed improvement on the term \\"linguaculture\\" coined by the American linguistic anthropologist Paul Friedrich. Agar explains the change stating that \\"language\\" is a more commonly used word in English. It seems that \\"linguaculture\\" is getting more common again (cf. Risager 2012). When Agar talks about languaculture, he defines it as the necessary tie between language and culture. He underlines that languages and cultures are always closely related and it is not possible to distinguish languages from cultures. Therefore, you cannot really know a language if you do not know also the culture expressed by that language. The notion of culture and its understanding involve the link between two different languacultures that Agar define LC1 (source languaculture) and LC2 (target languaculture). Rich points The learning of target languaculture is driven by \\"rich points\\", which are when people realize that a culture is different from their own and when they face some behaviours which they do not understand. Rich points are those surprises, those departures from an outsider's expectations that signal a difference between source languaculture and target languaculture. They are the moments of incomprehension, when people suddenly do not know what is happening. In this situation different reactions are possible. People can ignore the rich point and hope that the next part makes sense. People can perceive it as evidence that the person who produced it lacks something. Or people can wonder why they do not understand and if maybe some other languaculture comes into play. Therefore, rich points belong to daily life and not only to language. Agar highlights that the term rich has the positive connotations of thickness, wealth and abundance. The largest rich point is the total incomprehension due to huge differences between source languaculture and target languaculture. In this case people are facing a \\"culture shock\\" that causes a deep bewilderment. The smallest rich point can occur among different groups of the same community. The existence of rich points comes from the fact that every statement implicitly refers to various elements that are taken for granted in a certain culture and do not match the elements of another culture (cultural implicitness). Culture in languaculture According to Agar, culture is a construction, a translation between source languaculture and target languaculture. Like a translation, it makes no sense to talk about the culture of X without saying the culture of X for Y, taking into account the standpoint from which it is observed. For this reason culture is relational. Moreover, culture is always plural. No person or group can be described, explained or generalized completely with a single cultural label.

Introduction Active and passive damping techniques are common methods of attenuating the resonant vibrations excited in a structure. Active damping techniques are not applicable under all circumstances due, for example, to power requirements, cost, environment, etc. Under such circumstances, passive damping techniques are a viable alternative. Various forms of passive damping exist, including viscous damping, viscoelastic damping, friction damping, and impact damping. Viscous and viscoelastic damping usually have a relatively strong dependence on temperature. Friction dampers, while applicable over wide temperature ranges, may degrade with wear. Due to these limitations, attention has been focused on impact dampers, particularly for application in cryogenic environments or at elevated temperatures. Particle damping technology is a derivative of impact damping with several advantages. Impact damping refers to only a single (somewhat larger) auxiliary mass in a cavity, whereas particle damping is used to imply multiple auxiliary masses of small size in a cavity. The principle behind particle damping is the removal of vibratory energy through losses that occur during impact of granular particles which move freely within the boundaries of a cavity attached to a primary system. In practice, particle dampers are highly nonlinear dampers whose energy dissipation, or damping, is derived from a combination of loss mechanisms, including friction and momentum exchange. Because of the ability of particle dampers to perform through a wide range of temperatures and frequencies and survive for a longer life, they have been used in applications such as the weightless environments of outer space,H.V. Panossian, Structural damping enhancement via non-obstructive particle damping technique, Journal of Vibration and Acoustics, 114 (1992), pp. 101‚Äì105.R. Ehrgott, H. Panossian & G. Davis, Modelling techniques for evaluating the effectiveness of particle damping in turbomachinery, Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne, Canoga Park, CA. PDF in aircraft structures, to attenuate vibrations of civil structures,S.S. Simonian, Particle beam damper, Proceedings of the SPIE, 2445 (1995), pp. 149‚Äì160. and even in tennis rackets.S. Ashley, A new racket shakes up tennis, Mechanical Engineering, 117 (1995), pp. 80‚Äì81. Advantages of particle dampers * They can perform in a large range of temperature without loss of temperature. * They can survive for a long life. * They can perform in a very wide range of frequencies, unlike viscoelastic dampers, which are highly frequency dependent. * The particles placed inside a cavity in a structure can be less in weight than the mass they replace. * Through analyses, one can find the right kind, size and consistency of particles for the given application. Therefore, they are suited for applications where there is a need for long service in harsh environments. Analysis of particle damping The analysis of particle dampers is mainly conducted by experimental testing, simulations by discrete element method or finite element method, and by analytical calculations. The discrete element method makes use of particle mechanics, whereby individual particles are modeled with 6-degrees of freedom dynamics and their interactions result in the amount of energy absorbed/dissipated. This approach, although requires high power computing and the dynamic interactions of millions of particles, it is promising and may be used to estimate the effects of various mechanisms on damping. For instance, a study was performed Non-obstructive Particle Damping Experience and Capabilities, Panossian, H., Proceedings- Spie The International Society For Optical Engineering, 2002, ISSU 4753; VOL 2, pages 936-941. PDF using a model that simulated 10,000 particles in a cavity and studied the damping under various gravitational force effects. Research literature review A significant amount of research has been carried out in the area of analysis of particle dampers. Olson Steven E. Olson, An analytical particle damping model, Journal of Sound and Vibration, 264 (2003), pp. 1155‚Äì1166. presented a mathematical model that allows particle damper designs to be evaluated analytically. The model utilized the particle dynamics method and took into account the physics involved in particle damping, including frictional contact interactions and energy dissipation due to viscoelasticity of the particle material. Fowler et al.Bryce L. Fowler, Eric M. Flint, Steven E. Olson, Effectiveness and Predictability of Particle Damping, Proceedings of SPIE Volume 3989, Smart Structures and Materials 2000, Damping and Isolation, 2000. PDF discussed results of studies into the effectiveness and predictability of particle damping. Efforts were concentrated on characterizing and predicting the behaviour of a range of potential particle materials, shapes, and sizes in the laboratory environment, as well as at elevated temperature. Methodologies used to generate data and extract the characteristics of the nonlinear damping phenomena were illustrated with test results. Fowler et al.Bryce L. Fowler, Eric M. Flint, Steven E. Olson, Design Methodology for Particle Damping, SPIE Conference on Smart Structures and Materials, 2001. PDF developed an analytical method, based on the particle dynamics method, that used characterized particle damping data to predict damping in structural systems. A methodology to design particle damping for dynamic structures was discussed. The design methodology was correlated with tests on a structural component in the laboratory. Mao et al.Kuanmin Mao, Michael Yu Wang, Zhiwei Xu, Tianning Chen, DEM simulation of particle damping, Powder Technology, 142 (2004), pp. 154‚Äì 165. utilized DEM for computer simulation of particle damping.

Bach composed the cantata for performance in K√∂then to celebrate the birthday of Leopold von Anhalt-K√∂then. The cantata is one of a series of congratulatory works which Bach wrote for this employer. Some of them are lost, while others such as Der Himmel dacht auf Anhalts Ruhm und Gl√ºck, BWV 66.1 can be reconstructed because Bach reused the music later. Durchlauchtster Leopold is unusual in surviving in a complete state.  History and words  Bach composed the cantata as a congratulatory cantata, also termed serenata, for the 28th birthday of his employer, Leopold von Anhalt-K√∂then, on 10 December 1722. The holograph manuscript survives in Berlin, but cannot be dated exactly. The libretto shows a date of \\"before 22 December 1722\\". Bach may have begun the work when he was appointed Prince Leopold's ' in 1717, according to Alfred D√ºrr. If this hypothesis is correct, Bach would potentially have had a few months to compose a work for the prince's birthday, but even relatively simple music could have required some haste given the circumstances in which he left his job in Weimar, being imprisoned by his employer for not following correct resignation procedures. Bach was released on 2 December and was still in the process of moving to K√∂then on 10 December 1717. The unknown poet wrote eight movements. Only two of them, 1 and 5, are recitatives, but even these are regular in meter and rhyme and may have been intended for arias. The first recitative even shows a da capo of the first line, addressing \\"\\", translated to \\"Most illustrious Leopold\\" or, more literally, \\"Most Serene Leopold\\". The two vocal parts may have been allegorical figures, as for example in the cantata for New Year's Day , but are not marked in the text. In 1724 Bach used six of the eight movements to form his cantata , for Pentecost Monday, and in 1725 he took movement 7 for his cantata for Pentecost Tuesday . =Publication= The cantata was published in 1887 in the first complete edition of the composer's works, the Bach-Gesellschaft-Ausgabe.  Scoring and structure  The cantata is scored for two vocal soloists (soprano and bass), two flauto traverso, bassoon, two violins, viola and basso continuo including violone and harpsichord. The last movement is marked chorus, but was probably performed by the two soloists. # Recitative (soprano): # Aria (soprano): # Aria (bass): # Aria (soprano, bass): # Recitative (soprano, bass): # Aria (soprano): # Aria (bass): # Chorus (soprano, bass):  Music  Bach composed varied music for the rather monotonous text. Movement 1 is accompanied by the strings and leads to a virtuoso coloratura on the da capo of the first line, addressing Leopold. Movement 2 is reminiscent of a dance, gently scored for flutes and strings, in triplets. Movement 3 is a short praise movement, marked vivace. Movement 4 is a duet, marked \\"Al tempo di minuetto\\", which handles three stanzas in ever richer variations: the first stanza is for one voice and strings in G major, the second in the higher key of D major with additional flutes, the final one for both voices in A major in a denser musical texture. The structure of this duet is unique in Bach's cantatas, the variations in rising keys, and the increase in instruments and musical texture all adding up to illustrate the exaltation of the addressee. Movement 5 leads to an arioso. Movement 6 is a bourr√©e, dominated by a flute which comes and goes. Movement 7 is in great contrast set for only low voice and instruments, bassoon and cello in unison to a continuo played by violone and harpsichord. The final dance-like movement shows elements of a polonaise. Its two parts begin both with an instrumental concerto which is then repeated with embedded voices.

It is found in protein kinases with various specificities, including the aspartate, glutamate and uridylate kinase families. In prokaryotes and plants the synthesis of the essential amino acids lysine and threonine is predominantly regulated by feed-back inhibition of aspartate kinase (AK) and dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHPS). In Escherichia coli, thrA, metLM, and lysC encode aspartokinase isozymes that show feedback inhibition by threonine, methionine, and lysine, respectively. The lysine-sensitive isoenzyme of aspartate kinase from spinach leaves has a subunit composition of 4 large and 4 small subunits. In plants although the control of carbon fixation and nitrogen assimilation has been studied in detail, relatively little is known about the regulation of carbon and nitrogen flow into amino acids. The metabolic regulation of expression of an Arabidopsis thaliana aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase (AK/HSD) gene, which encodes two linked key enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of aspartate family amino acids has been studied. The conversion of aspartate into either the storage amino acid asparagine or aspartate family amino acids may be subject to a coordinated, reciprocal metabolic control, and this biochemical branch point is a part of a larger, coordinated regulatory mechanism of nitrogen and carbon storage and utilization.

The lexicon is essential for the NLP (Natural language processing), as well as a prerequisite to any wide-coverage parser.Sagot, Beno√Æt. Automatic acquisition of a Slovak Lexicon from a Raw Corpus. The two main requirements represent raw corpus and the morphological description of the language. The aim is to provide lemmas that will serve to the explanation of all the words that occur within the corpus. For the achievement of a quality lexicon it is necessary to manually validate the generated lemmas and iterate the whole process several times. The process is focused on the open word classes (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs). Closed classes (e.g. prepositions, pronouns, numerals) are excluded. This method is applicable to the languages with a rich morphology, such as Slovak, Russian or Croatian. Applied to Slovak, being an inflectional language, the automatic acquisition focuses on the inflectional morphology as well as on the derivational morphology. This fact enables the users to find out the information about derivational relations (e.g. adjectivizations, prefixes) in the lexicon. For example, Slovak word korpusov√Ω is an adjectivization of korpus (eng. corpus).  Three-step loop  Conformably to Beno√Æt Sagot, there are three stages involved in the acquisition of lemmas: * 1. Generation and inflection * 2. Ranking * 3. Manual validation ''' The more iteration will be performed, the more accurate lexicon will be obtained. For each iteration are essential the information given by a manual validator. = Generation and inflection = Firstly, all words which represent the closed word classes (pronouns, prepositions, numerals) are manually excluded from the given corpus. Number of their occurrences in the corpus is provided. Then the automatic generation comes, when the hypothetical lemmas according to the morphological description of a language are created. Generated lemmas are consequently being inflected, so that all of their inflected forms are built. Obtained forms are associated with the corresponding lemma and a morphological tag. = Ranking = There was created a probabilistic model, represented by a fix-point algorithm, to rank the hypothetical lemmas generated in the first step. Best ranked lemmas are expected to be ideally all correct, whereas the least ranked tend to be incorrect. = Manual validation = Correctness of the best- ranked lemmas created in the previous step are checked by the manual validator, who should be a native speaker. Lemmas are at this stage divided into three categories: \\\\- valid lemmas, appended to lexicon \\\\- erroneous lemmas generated by valid forms ( later associated to another lemmas) \\\\- erroneous lemmas generated by invalid forms (these need to be excluded)  Future development  Automatic acquisition, in comparison to a purely manual development of the lexicons, seems to be promising, considering the future development, because of the short validation time needed and the relatively small amount of human labor involved.

Founded by Per Kure in 1897, it was for most of its history based at Hasle in Oslo, Norway. The company was dissolved during the creation of Asea Brown Boveri in 1988. History Per Kure, born in 1872, returned to Norway in 1897 after receiving an education in electronics in Mittweida, Germany. He established the company that bore his name on 28 September. The company started working with installation of electrical apparatuses, including lights and motors. Originally located in the street Kristian Augusts gate, the company moved to Universitetsgata 24 in 1905. The company was importer of Elektra, a Swiss brand of electrical heaters, and from 1911, the company received a license to produce the products for Norway and Sweden. In 1912, the company started selling products from Nya F√∂renade Elektriska Aktiebolaget of Sweden in Norway. After it had merged to create Allm√§nna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA), Per Kure took over ASEA's Norwegian division, Norsk Motor- og Dynamofabrik, and the new company was renamed A/S Per Kure Norsk Motor- og Dynamofabrik. The merged company produced transformers, which were largely sold for production of hydroelectricity in Norway. In 1937, all of the company's manufacturing was localized at Hasle. Per Kure remained CEO until 1938, by which time the company had 500 employees. Per Kure built transformers two classes of Norwegian electric locomotives, El 5 and El 9. In 1944, during the Second World War, the Norwegian resistance movement was active with sabotage against companies which were supplying the German armed forces. Workers at Per Kure had joined the communist resistance group Osvald. Because of the Allied bombing of Germany, Per Kure was thought to become part of a decentralized production facility for assembly of aircraft engines, and Osvald considered the plant a legitimate target. On 30 May 1944, the entire plant at Hasle was blown up and several transformers severely damaged. The action was not coordinated with central parts of the resistance, such as Milorg, which had a more passive strategy. In 1945, Per Kure died, and ASEA bought the company and renamed ASEA‚ÄìPer Kure. In 1967, the production of Elektra products was sold. The company remained until 1988, when ASEA merged to become ABB. In 1988, ASEA‚ÄìPer Kure was dissolved and the following year, production of transformers at Hasle ceased.

She left Port Jackson on 4 September 1791 for Norfolk Island and on the voyage was the first known vessel to enter Port Stephens. Salamander Point (now Nelson Head and Fly Point), Salamander Bay (now Nelson Bay), the present Salamander Bay and associated suburb were named after her. Southern whale fisheries (1791‚Äì1793): Salamander then became a whaler in the South Pacific. Not having much luck she sailed on to Peru. She was reported off the coast there in November 1792 with 30 tons of sperm oil. On 30 March 1793 she was \\"all well\\" at with 132 barrels of sperm oil and 6000 seal skins. She returned to England on 15 September 1793 with 117 tuns of sperm oil and 6100 seal skins, having come via St Salvadore.\\"Ship News\\", Times (London, England), 21 August 1793; pg. 3; Issue 2758. Southern whale fisheries (1794‚Äì1796): Under the command of Captain William Irish, on 9 February 1794 Salamander sailed again for the New South Wales fishery.British Southern Whale Fishery Database ‚Äì voyages: Salamander. By May she was at Rio de Janeiro, where she underwent repairs and calefaction. She was in Rio again in May two years later, replenishing her supplies. She returned to Britain on 2 September 1796 with 141 tuns of sperm oil, seven tuns of whale oil, five cwt of bone, and 250 seal skins. Transport (1797‚Äì1799): SAD data shows that the \\"Salamander transport\\" sailed from Yarmouth on 17 June 1797, bound for the West Indies. She was later reported at Barbados and Jamaica. The \\"Salamander (Transport)\\" returned from Jamaica, arriving at Gravesend on 27 July 1799.LL 30 July 1799, ‚Ññ3086, SAD data. Southern whale fisheries (1800‚Äì1801): Salamander underwent a \\"good repair\\" in 1799. Captain Thomas Hopper then received a letter of marque on 13 December for Salamander. The Protection Lists, which exempted the crews of certain classes of vessels, such as whalers, from impressment, listed her from 1798 to 1800. She sailed in 1800 for the Brazil Banks. She stopped in at Rio de Janeiro in May 1800 seeking repairs after having been attacked. She was reported off the Cape of Good Hope on 4 April 1801 on her way to the Cape of Good Hope for the condemnation of a small Spanish prize Salamander had taken off the Brazilian coast. At the time Salamander had 150 tons of whale oil.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4159. On 2 October 1801 Salamander was at St Helena. She then returned to England on 8 November. Lloyd's Register for 1802 listed Salamander as a London-based transport, with Hutchins, master, and still under the ownership of Mellish & Co. There was no mention of armament. She underwent another \\"good repair\\" that year. 1st slave voyage (1802‚Äì1803): A database of slave voyages shows that Salamander became a slave ship with William Jameson, master and Anthony Calvert, owner. Captain William Jameson sailed from London on 11 October 1802, bound for West Africa. Because she sailed during the short-lived Peace of Amiens Jameson did not acquire a letter of marque. Salamander stated acquiring slaves at Cape Coast Castle on 12 December 1802. she delivered 313 slaves to Havana on 1 May 1803. She arrived back at London on 26 August 1803.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database ‚Äì Salamander voyage #83466. 2nd slave voyage (1804): Lloyd's Register for 1804 showed Salamanders ownership had changed to Carver & Co., her master to Walbert, and her trade to London-Africa. Captain Derick Woolbert acquired a letter of marque on 17 February 1804. He sailed from London on 4 March 1804.Trans Atlantic Slave Trade Database ‚Äì Salamander voyage #83467. Despite her armament and letter of marque, Salamander was captured in 1804, recaptured, and taken into Barbados.Lloyd's List, n¬∞4507. The French privateer Grand D√©cid√©, of 20 guns and 153 men, captured Princess Royal, a brig privateer of 10 guns, which was carrying government stores.

When recaptured the \\"English Ship Salamander - (a Guineaman)\\", she had only five slaves aboard. Princess Royal too was recaptured, by , and arrived at Barbados on 13 October.\\"SHIP NEWS\\", Morning Chronicle (London, England), 22 November 1804; Issue 11080. Subsequent career: After 1804 Salamander disappeared from newspaper mentions in \\"Ship News\\" sections, particularly of ship arrivals and departures. From 1805 on, Lloyd's Register has an unchanged entry showing Wolbert, master, Calvert & Co., owner, and trade London-Africa. The database of slave voyages, however, has no further record of such voyages, and Britain abolished the slave trade in 1807. The entry continues unchanged through 1811. Salamander was no longer listed in 1812. With minor differences, the same holds true for the entry in the Register of Shipping.

In July 2010 Shannon ABC formed a strategic life sciences cluster with the Pharmaceutical & Molecular Biotechnology Research Centre (PMBRC) and the Ion Channel Biotechnology Centre (ICBC). This cluster was developed with the intention of providing further expertise to industry while taking advantage of complementary capabilities in the centres. Industry collaboration The key aim of Shannon ABC is to assist in the continued prosperity of industry by offering access to wide-ranging expertise and know how, state of the art equipment and facilities and access to a wide variety of national and international funding programmes. Shannon ABC provides biotechnology services on a range of levels. Companies can use Enterprise Ireland funded schemes (such as Innovation Vouchers and Innovation Partnerships) to carry out research, or they can fund the work themselves as contract research. Industry partners include those from a range of industries, including: Food, Agriculture, Marine, Pharmaceutical, Healthcare, Cosmetics, etc. Research Funding from Enterprise Ireland for the initial period of existence of Shannon ABC provided for the development of niche expertise areas of the Centre, as well as providing for a critical mass of experienced, commercially focused researchers.

In the absence of bioactivity, competencies within the Centre can be used to recommend other ways to add value to waste processes. Bioactive compounds A key research, development and innovation area for Shannon ABC are bioactive molecules. Bioactive molecules are those derived from biological origin that exhibit an active effect, and can include anti-oxidants, immunomodulatory compounds, anti microbials, prebiotics, etc. Bioactive molecules are extracted by traditional solvent extraction techniques or by super critical fluid extraction. Activity can then be screened for and molecules of interest identified.

Adopted at the start of the age of heraldry (circa 1200-1215). These arms were later quartered by Baron de Clifford Brougham Castle, built by Robert de Vieuxpont Robert de Vieuxpont (died 1227/8) (alias Vipont, also Veteripont Latinized to de Vetere Ponte (\\"from the Old Bridge\\")) was an Anglo-Norman landowner and administrator in the north of England. Origins He was born the younger son of William de Vieuxpont and his wife Maud de Morville. Career He entered royal service and was initially employed in Normandy as a paymaster of troops and director of military works, including those on Rouen Castle. He was rewarded in February 1203 by being given custody of Appleby Castle and Brough Castle, to which the lordship of Westmorland was added a month later, together with the office of Sheriff of Westmorland, to be held in perpetuity by his heirs. After returning from Normandy with King John in late 1203 Vieuxpont became increasingly involved in northern administration. In October 1204 he became High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests including control of Nottingham Castle, an important power base and store of the royal treasury. In 1206 he was a justice and assessor of tallage in the northern counties, in 1207 he was given custody of the See of York, and in April 1208 custody of the See of Durham. From 1210 to 1216 he was Sheriff of Devon and from 1210-1213 Sheriff of Wiltshire. He was highly trusted by King John, who put in his care both his treasury, his son Richard and his niece Eleanor, Fair Maid of Brittany. In 1216 he was also entrusted with the custody of Carlisle Castle, and from 1217 to 1222 was appointed Sheriff of Cumberland. He successfully defended his extensive landholdings from Scottish depredation, and built Brougham Castle in the process. Marriage and children In 1213 he married Idoine de Builli, the daughter of John de Builli, a descendant of Roger de Busli, which match brought him more land and honours. By Idonea he had children: *John Vipont (died 1242), who left children: **John Vipont (died 1241) **Robert de Vieuxpont (died 1264), who died from wounds received at the Battle of Lewes (1264) fighting on the side of Simon de Montfort. Following the defeat of de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265 and the return of King Henry III to power, Robert II's estate was seized by the Crown, but was later returned as part of a settlement with the reform leaders, and the Vieuxpont inheritance was divided in moieties between the daughters and co- heiresses of Robert II ‚Äì Isabella and Idonea. On the death of Idonea Vipont her moiety was regained by Isabella's husband Roger de Clifford, who thenceforth held one of the greatest northern lordships, ancestor of Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford (c. 1274 ‚Äì 1314), Feudal baron of Skipton. *Christiana Vipont, whom her father married off to his ward Thomas de Greystoke, son and heir of William de Greystoke, baron of Greystoke in Cumberland.

Cornish Language Partnership. is a small fishing village on the east coast of The Lizard peninsula to the south of the Helford River, in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom.It was built in the junction of Ley lines. It sits between the two neighbouring villages of St Keverne and Roskorwell. One road runs through the village, and there is public house, the Five Pilchards, named for the pilchard fishery. Porthallow lies at the midpoint of the South West Coast Path and is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).  Geology  The geology of the Lizard is complex and of great interest to geologists. The peninsula can be divided into two areas, with an irregular boundary running between Polurrian Cove on the west (Mount's Bay) coast and Porthallow in the east. To the north is the Meneage and to the south the Lizard District with the geology differing greatly between the two districts. The coast to the north of the village is designated as a Geological Conservation Review (GCR) site, and to the north and south is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Some 270 Ma years ago when the Lizard rocks were thrust up, the Meneage Crush Zone and Meneage Breccia was formed and the rocks to the north are of thick beds of conglomerates, and a combination of clay slates, mixed with sandstones and grits containing veins of quartz. To the south the rocks are serpentine, gabbro and hornblende schist. Porthallow beach History Porthallow, meaning \\"port at the end of the moor\\", was a flourishing fishing village in the 13th- century. It was first used as a fishing base by Beaulieu Abbey. Rents raised on fishing ports within the Duchy of Cornwall, during the 14th-century, indicate that Porthallow was a major fishing village paying slightly less rent than Fowey to the east. In 1836 the West Briton newspaper reported that several ‚Ä≥seans‚Ä≥ operated on the Lizard Peninsula at Perhala (Porthallow), Proustock (Porthoustock), The Lizard (possibly Polpeor Cove), etc. Some were taken to Falmouth and sold for two shilling per hundred, the rest would feed local people during the winter. The Trelowarren estate later owned the village and leased it to The Porthallow Pilchard Curing Company from 1914 to 1937. It was then bought by the Porthallow Institute and Reading Room. An attempt was made to attract tourists to Porthallow in 1881 with an advertisement in The Cornishman newspaper on 9 June 1881 for a newly built Inn. The advertisement mentioned the serpentine specimens and fine views on the cliffs, the good river and sea fishing and the perfectly safe sea bathing. In the 1960s the village was popular as a launch site for diving on The Manacles with a compressor and dive shop on the beach. Diving activities and overnight camping were banned from the beach following years of late night parties, loud music and bonfires, when in 1971, Trustees from the village bought and ran the beach. The Porthallow Village Association became a charity in 2008 and is now still maintained by a voluntary group of Trustees from the village. There is a Diving Centre at Polkerris, 1 km to the south. A new village hall was constructed in 2010.

While moderate numbers of Yugoslav citizens had residence in Switzerland during the 1980s, the bulk of immigration took place as a consequence of the Yugoslav Wars and the later Kosovo War, as well as by means of family reunion of those who had immigrated during this period. About half a million immigrants from the former Yugoslavia lived in Switzerland as of 2009, corresponding to roughly 6.5% of total Swiss population . About half of this number are ethnic Albanians (mostly Kosovo Albanians and to a lesser extent Albanians from North Macedonia), while the other half is of South Slavic origin. Taken as a single group, people from former Yugoslavia are the largest immigrant group in Switzerland, followed by the Italians at about 294,000. From the ethnic perspective, Albanians form the second largest immigrant group. Demographics Since the Swiss Federal Statistical Office keeps a record of the nationalities of foreign residents, their ethnicity is not recorded. In the case of former Yugoslavia, where ethnic conflict was the reason for the war and the breakup of the country, this had the consequence that there were several, sometimes mutually hostile, ethnic groups living in Switzerland, all registered under the same nationality. =History= In 1920, 1,235 citizens of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia had residence in Switzerland. This number dropped to below 700 during World War II. After the end of the war and the formation of Democratic Federal Yugoslavia, the number grew slowly, to 1,169 in 1960. During the 1960s to 1970s, immigration began to pick up noticeably with the influx of migrant workers, with 24,971 Yugoslav citizens registered in 1970 and 60,916 in 1980. On the eve of the collapse of Yugoslavia, immigration increased steeply, with 172,777 Yugoslavs registered in Switzerland by 1990. Immigration accelerated still more during the Yugoslav Wars. In 1995, there were more than 330,000 foreigners from former Yugoslavia residing in Switzerland, partly still registered with Yugoslavian nationality, partly under the nationality of Yugoslavia's successor states.Wohnbev√∂lkerung nach Geschlecht und detaillierter Staatsangeh√∂rigkeit, 1850‚Äì2009 , Swiss Federal Statistical Office. Registration under the successor states of Yugoslavia began gradually after 1992, but the problem remained unresolved until the year 2000. In 1998, there were still 198,131 foreign residents registered as \\"Yugoslavian\\". This number fell to 5,507 by 2000 and to zero by 2001. The same problem was repeated on a smaller scale with the breakaway of Montenegro from the state of Serbia and Montenegro, and Kosovo from Serbia in 2006 and 2008, respectively. The statistics for 2011 record an increase by 8,922 in the number of citizens of Kosovo, and at the same time a decrease by 10,386 in the number of citizens of Serbia. This does not reflect any real population movement, but the registrations as citizens of Kosovo by Albanians who were formerly registered as Serbian citizens.Zuwanderung: Wer woher kam, Tages-Anzeiger, 21 February 2012. =Current demographics= As of 2009, nationals of successor states of Yugoslavia are registered as follows: *Serbia and Montenegro: 187,554 (including also those with newer Serbian, Montenegrin or Kosovan passports) *North Macedonia: 60,293 *Bosnia and Herzegovina: 37,397 *Croatia: 35,259 *Slovenia: 2,501 By 1995, there were 40,000 Macedonian citizens in Switzerland. This number has risen further to 61,000 by 2002. This increase does not necessarily reflect immigration, but rather re-registration of formerly Yugoslav citizens as Macedonian nationals. An estimated 50,000 emigrants from North Macedonia are Albanians from North Macedonia.The Albanian fund-raising machine (2001 estimate reported by BBC) Since Kosovo began to issue passports in 2009, an increasing number of Albanians in Switzerland have since been registered as citizens of Kosovo. The number of foreign residents from former Yugoslavia naturalized as Swiss citizens in 2009 was at 14,780 (Serbia, Montenegro and Kosovo: 8,879; Bosnia and Herzegovina: 2,408; North Macedonia: 1,831; Croatia: 1,599; Slovenia: 63). This corresponds to one third of the total number of naturalizations during this year. In 2010, out of a total of 40,403 naturalizations, 13,440 were accounted for by citizens of successor states of Yugoslavia, again corresponding to one third of the total number (Serbia: 6,843, Bosnia and Herzegovina: 1,924; Kosovo 1,609; North Macedonia: 1,585; Croatia: 1,479). Ethnicities In terms of ethnicity, these populations consist mostly of Albanians, Bosniaks, Serbs, Croats and ethnic Macedonians. The size of each group is unknown and only amenable to rough estimates. An indicator of ethnicity can be taken from data on languages spoken in Switzerland. Unfortunately, the latest data on this was collected in the 2000 census. At that time, there were 103,000 native speakers of Serbo- Croatian, 95,000 speakers of Albanian and 61,300 speakers of Macedonian. Estimates on the actual ethnic composition of former Yugoslav immigrants in Switzerland are mostly left to ethnic cultural organizations. They cannot be expected to have better than single-digit accuracy, but nevertheless give an overview of the general situation; such estimates amount to roughly 250,000 Albanians,Die Albaner in der Schweiz: Geschichtliches ‚Äì Albaner in der Schweiz seit 1431 Im Namen aller Albaner eine Moschee? 150,000 Serbs, 80,000 Croats and 10,000 Macedonians.Boskovska (2000), p. 2648. The number of Slovenians in Switzerland is much smaller, well within the four-digit range. The Albanians in Switzerland consist to about 80% of Kosovo Albanians, 20% from North Macedonia, and a small number from Albania. Cultural organizations Macedonians in Switzerland are organized through many associations and clubs. The first such association was formed in 1988, and by 1991 there were five Macedonian clubs, now all part of one single organization called Zdru≈æenie na Makedonskite Dru≈°tva (ZMD), which was formed in 1992. The main purpose of this organisation was to encourage and spread Macedonian ideals, culture, language, and tradition. Reception The image of the groups from former Yugoslavia in Swiss society is very poor. In a survey performed in Zurich in 2011, \\"Former Yugoslavs\\" were found to be the least popular immigrant group, followed by Turks, Arabs and Germans.Marc Helbling (2011): \\"Why Swiss-Germans dislike Germans. Opposition to culturally similar and highly skilled immigrants\\", European Societies 13(1): 5‚Äì27. The Albanians have been singled out for their particularly poor image.Burri Shurani et al. (2010), 41-42, 67-70. As the largest group, they tend to be the most visible, besides the factor of prejudice against Islam, and the perceived link between immigration and crime. In a 2010 statistic, young males of the former Serbia and Montenegro (which to a large extent corresponds to the Kosovo Albanians in Switzerland) were found to have a crime rate of 310% of the young males in Swiss population, while those from Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia had crime rates of 230%-240% of the Swiss value. It has been pointed out that the crime rates cannot be the only reason for the group's poor image, as the crime rate of the Sri Lankans in Switzerland was still higher, at 470%, while that group has a much better reputation.Neue Statistik: Tamilen sind krimineller als Ex- Jugoslawen, Tages-Anzeiger 12 September 2010.

In 1989, he escaped from Yugoslav prison and came back to Switzerland to kidnap Swiss industrialist Karl Z√ºnd. He was arrested after a failed ransom transaction, but escaped from prison again in August 1993. Danilovic now had the plan to kidnap the richest Swiss businessmen, beginning with Martin Ebner. After three unsuccessful kidnapping attempts, he was arrested once again in December 1993. He reportedly planned to kidnap Christoph Blocher next. Danilovic was released from prison in 2008. He next perpetrated a series of armed robberies on wealthy residences in Lower Austria. He was arrested in Austria in March 2010.Showdown im Ried, NZZ Folio 05/96.

It is located northeast of Laurel and west of Billings. The elevation is 3,327 feet (1014 m.) Hesper appears on the Mossmain U.S. Geological Survey Map. History Hesper was established in 1917 as a town adjoining the Hesper ranch and is also the name of the school district. The name Hesper or Hesperus, is the evening star, and according to old mythology, the king of the western land. The name has Masonic roots. The community is named after the Hesper Farm, founded by Ignatius Daniel O'Donnell. In its heyday, the depot in Hesper served as a hub for surrounding farms and ranchers in the area. However, by the 1940s the town began to lose importance and declined. Most of the original township itself is no longer in use, with many of the original structures leveled or abandoned. The community is home to the Yellowstone Boys and Girls Ranch and is now considered a subdivision of the Billings Metro Area. The former Hesper School District is currently the Elder Grove Elementary School District and is still in operation today, serving grades kindergarten through eight.

In military doctrinal handbooks the identified intent artefacts generally express the initial state and situation, the desired end state and outcome, and how to get to the desired end state. Artefacts describing the initial situation are: own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Artefacts describing the outcome are: purpose, goals, mission, effects and end state. Artefacts describing how to reach the outcome are: concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, risk willing, how results might enable transition to future operations, objectives, transition conditions, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage. Another way to identify intent artefacts is from how people actually communicate intent. Klein (1998, pp. 225‚Äì29)Klein (1998, pp. 225‚Äì29) present the results of information types that is identified in intent communication. The seven information types of intent are according to Klein (1998, p. 226): (1) Purpose of task which describes why the task is performed, (2) objective of task, presents a picture of the desired outcome, (3) sequence of steps in the plan. Klein identifies this to be a source of problem since too detailed descriptions may limit the subordinates initiative, (4) rationale for plan includes all the information that where present when making the decision, (5) key decisions that may have to be made, i.e. if there is a choice to be made the commander can provide the intent in how he wants it to be conducted, (6) antigoals, describe unwanted outcomes, and (7) constraints and other considerations describes weather and rule of engagement etc. = Intent content definition = The doctrinal artefacts are mapped into the structure provided by Klein and the resulting seven facets are grouped in: (a) Initial Situation describing initial situation and state and consists of Kleins rationale for the plan, (b) Outcome is describing outcomes and consists of Kleins Purpose of task, objective of task, and antigoals, and (c) Execution that is describing how to reach the outcome and consists of Kleins sequence of steps, key decisions and constraints and other considerations. Intent is then defined to consist of the following eight facets. * Mission/Goal ‚Äì The purpose of the task (the higher-level goals). It provides the rationale why the missions and task are to be executed. It is a high-level definition of the overall intent and is regularly stated in one sentence following on the form of Who, What, When, Where and Why. A Mission/Goal can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. Mission/Goal belongs to the intent group outcome. * End-State ‚Äì The objective of the task in form of a representation of the desired outcome. The desired outcome is described as a state, e.g. completion of a task, the effects from tasks, or even the execution of tasks over time. The purpose is to provide a picture of the End- State. According to Klein (1998, p. 226) in his investigation, the end-state objective was only missing once in the thirty five examined Commander's intent statements. Effect is in this work defined as the physical and/or behavioural state of a system that results from an action, a set of actions, or another effect. The End State is a more detail description of the Mission/Goal statement and can be described in several sentences. An End State can be described by using the Actions, Effects or a compound State, i.e. situation. End State belongs to the intent group outcome. * Sequence ‚Äì The sequence of steps in the plan ‚Äì This is the plan that describes what do in general terms such as Courses of Actions and Course of Effects. Sequence belongs to the intent group execution describing how to reach the desired outcome and include concept of operations, tasks to subordinate units, how results might enable the transition to future operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage. * Initial State ‚Äì The situation that builds the rationale for the plan, what information was available, who was making the decisions, under what time pressure and similar circumstances. Initial State encompass own and other forces, adversaries, operating environment, terrain, time, preparation for future operations. Initial State belongs to the intent group initial situation. * Key Decisions ‚Äì The key decisions that may have to be made and guide the commander in how to make choices. Key Decisions belongs to the intent group execution and describes how to reach the desired outcome and encompass how results might enable the transition to future operations, transition conditions and expectations of force usage. * Antigoals ‚Äì Antigoals describe undesired outcomes. Antigoals are meaningful when to clarify alternatives action plans and what the resulting outcome might be. Antigoals are described in the same way as End State with the difference in that antigoals describe the unwanted outcome. In the surveyed doctrinal descriptions of intent, antigoals were not mentioned. Antigoals belong to the intent outcome. * Constraints ‚Äì Constraints and other considerations that should be taken into account and can vary from policy to weather and terrain. Constraints belongs to the intent group execution and encompass risk willing, restrictions in conducting operations, allocation of resources, and expectations of force usage. * An eight facet Expressives is proposed in Gustavsson et al. (2008d; 2011) to capture the style of organizations and commanders: experience, risk taking, use of power and force, diplomacy; ethics; norms; morale; creativity; and unorthodox behaviour. The use of Expressives can range from situations where participants (e.g. commanders) express their style to other participants (e.g. subordinates), or by Staff that develop models over the participants (commanders and subordinates) to be used in Course of Action development and war gaming. In both cases Expressives are a support to better understand the collaboration participants‚Äô capabilities and conduct of operations.  Intent in command and control  = Commander's intent = Commander's intent is an intent describing military focused operations and it is a publicly stated description of the end-state as it relates to forces (entities, people) and terrain, the purpose of the operation, and key tasks to accomplish. It is developed by a small group, e.g. staff, and a commander. Commander's intent (CSI) plays a central role in military decision making and planning. CSI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders to transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commander. The commander's intent links the mission and concept of operations. It describes the end state and key tasks that, along with the mission, are the basis for subordinates‚Äô initiative. Commanders may also use the commander's intent to explain a broader purpose beyond that of the mission statement. The mission and the commander's intent must be understood two echelons down. (U.S Army 2003, para. 4-27) Pigeau and McCann (2006)Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2006) Establishing Common Intent: The Key to Co-Ordinated Military Action. In: The Operational Art : Canadian Perspectives : Leadership and Command, 2006, Kingston, Ontario, Canada: Canadian Defence Academy Press, pp. 85‚Äì108. state that intent is more than an aim or a purpose; they state that Intent contains the aim and purpose together with all implications. Hence, CSI is not only to describe the End-State but also a concise expression of the purpose of the operation. CSI may also include the commander's assessment of the adversary commander's intent and an assessment of where and how much risk is acceptable during the operation. This view is supported by Klein (1998, p. 225)Klein, G. (1998) Sources of Power - How People Make Decisions Cambridge, MA: The Mit Press. . CSI originates from one commander's mind and is disseminated to the echelons below. CSI rarely gets reviewed and updated. For a short duration mission, such as a deliberate attack, the original statement may remain valid throughout planning. But for longer phases, in order to be agile the CSI might be changing in phase with the unfolding of the situation. Commanders must develop their intent within the bounds of a whole hierarchy of guiding principles that limit the types of solutions that they can entertain (Pigeau & McCann 2006). = Common intent = Common intent is an intent that is shared and understood by all participants, i.e. there is no discrepancy between the intent of the participating humans. Common intent is an idealized view of intent. In today's operational environment teams need to work together towards a desired End-State. Pigeau and McCann (2000)Pigeau, R. and McCann, C. (2000) \\"Redefining Command and Control\\". In: R. Pigeau and C. McCann, (eds.) The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience, 2000, New York, NY, USA: Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 165‚Äì84. . define Command and Control: ‚ÄúCommand and Control: The establishment of common intent to achieve coordinated action‚Äù. Common intent is the combination of explicit intent and implicit intent. Pigeau and McCann (2006) put forward that for a realizable Common Intent there need to be a single shared objective, together with a clear understanding in how that objective can be attained. They continue that Common Intent is an idealized concept where maximum overlap, with minimum scattering, exists between the intent of the commander and the intents of his subordinates. Knowledge known by the commander and his subordinates needs to be shared at all levels, guiding principles, reasoning ability, and to express similar levels of commitment. Intent is then not only something for a commander to disseminate but to exchange and learning the team members‚Äô intent. Farrell and Lichacz (2004)Farrell, P.S.E. and Lichacz, F. (2004) \\"Measuring Common Intent during Effects Based Planning\\". In: 2004 Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium The Power of Information Age Concepts and Technologies. state that common intent describes a socio- psychological phenomenon that seems to be evident amongst a team that achieves a common objective. The CSI is a sort of a one person's view, but as said in the introduction ‚Äúevery individual have intent of her own‚Äù implies that it may not just be enough to disseminate intent amongst staff members and subordinates. A conclusion of the work of Farrell (2006)Farrell, P.S.E. (2006) \\"Common Intent and Information Processing Frameworks applied to Effect Based Approaches to Operations\\". In: 2006, Cambridge, UK: CCRP. is that teams with different military and civilian cultures would need that all team members establish a common understanding of the mission objectives and the Commander's intent with respect to their own competencies, authorities, and responsibilities. Pigeau and McCann (2006, pp. 85‚Äì108) state that diverse team members need to have a high degree of common intent to perform effectively. In such teams the commander needs to ensure that the intent is perceived and understood by all team members (Pigeau & McCann 2000; Farrell & Lichacz 2004; Pigeau & McCann 2006; Farrell 2006). Alberts and Hayes (2007) say that in order to allow subordinates‚Äô initiative the operations order focuses on describing the CSI/CI so that flexibility in coordination and collaboration in the dynamic environment is entailed. There is a need for the commander to connect the subordinates‚Äô human potential (reason, opinions, questions, seek information regarding the mission) to align and be a support to the commanders own intent (Pigeau & McCann 2006, p. 102). = Command intent = Command intent (CI) is a practical view of common intent, meaning that it is not plausible to expect that all individuals during a whole mission in all situations will share the same intent. CI will be developed for specific parts of missions and shared amongst the participants. To establish CI the involvement of all participants is necessary, e.g. compare with football or soccer teams where the overall intent is formalized by coaches in collaboration with the players and where each player knows what the other players‚Äô intentions are. Pigeau and McCann (2000) states that ‚ÄúIn reality, it is presumed true that it is impossible to have common intent‚Äù. For a specific mission bounded for a certain time an overlap of intent ought to be achievable, e.g. as illustrated by the players in a soccer team where all have individual goals with their lives and families, but on the soccer field they have the common intent to win the game. This means that during the game, and in training and exercises prior to and after the game their common intent is to perform well according to the mission declared by the coach (Farrell & Lichacz 2004; Farrell 2006; Gustavsson et al. 2008d).Gustavsson, P.M., Hieb, M.R., Niklasson, L., Eriksson, P. and Moore, P. (2008d) \\"Machine Interpretable Representation of Commander's Intent\\". In: Proceedings of the 13th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium (ICCRTS). Bellevue, Washington, USA. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/13th_iccrts_2008/CD/html/papers/188.pdf. 188. A workable version of common intent is command intent that is directed for a specific situation, bounded by participating organization, space and time, i.e. for the operation at hand the intent is common but other intent and goals of the participating humans may differ. Much of the coordination can be done locally, i.e. on a lower level, without explicit orders. Brehmer (2009)Brehmer, B. (2009) \\"Command without Commanders\\". In: June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. proposes that the higher levels of command will have the time to consider other aspects of the problems facing them. Brehmer continues that there is the loss of combat power inherent in top-down command- directed synchronization. By NATO Network Enabled Capabilities (NNEC) as presented by Alberts, Garstka & Stein (1999, pp. 87‚Äì93) this is overcome by a high-speed continuum. Brehmer (2009) however says that the main responsibility of the commander and his staff is to articulate intent and crafting rules of engagement. For armed forces that have mission command as their principal doctrine this is not a new concept, but Brehmer further envisions that with articulated intent larger units will be able to co-ordinate with other units and conduct the mission without any explicit directions from higher headquarters. Command Intent is then an outline of a plan, objectives to be achieved, responsibilities, linkages and schemas of manoeuvre, and constraints. Establishing command intent also involves more than one person. Traditional Commander's intent is then replaced by an intent that arises from dialogue between commanders and key staff at more than one level. Command intent is to allow self-synchronization and to provide understanding of the complex causes and effects. To enable self-synchronization the subordinates must be given the mandate to operate on their own initiatives, within the boundary of the mission. In ‚ÄúRethinking Command and Control‚Äù by Curts and Cambell (2006),Curts, R.J. and Cambell, D.E. (2006) \\"Rethinking Command and Control\\". In: March 2006, San Diego, CA: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/2006_CCRTS/html/papers/005.pdf [Accessed March 16, 2009]. the authors address this fine line between delegating authority and maintaining and controlling hierarchy The commander delegating authority must refrain from directing the actions of subordinates, yet must also maintain some command structure. The subordinates must have the ability to work independently or within a team to achieve the mission goals. To create this empowerment the commander's information should be shared with everyone. Autonomy is created by setting boundaries and hierarchy then can be replaced by self-directed teams. CI acts as a basis for staffs and subordinates to develop their own plans and orders that transform thought into action, while maintaining the overall intention of their commanders (Gustavsson et al. 2008d; 2009Gustavsson, P.M. and Hieb, M.R. (2009) \\"Supporting Collaboration in Collective Endeavours with a Model of Operations Intent and Effects\\". In: Proceedings of the 14th International Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium, June 2009, Washington D.C.: CCRP. Available at: http://www.dodccrp.org/events/14th_iccrts_2009/papers/055.pdf. 055.). = Explicit and implicit intent = Explicit intent is an intent that is publicly stated and made available for the participants. Implicit intent is an intent that is not publicly stated. Implicit intent can be made explicit by the mechanism described below. Shattuck and Woods (2000)Shattuck, L.G. and Woods, D.D. (2000) \\"Communication Of Intent In Military Command and Control Systems\\". In: C. McCann and R. Pigeau, (eds.) The Human in Command: Exploring the Modern Military Experience, Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, pp. 279‚Äì92. Available at: http://csel.eng.ohio-state.edu/woods/C2/shattuck_Nato.pdf [Accessed July 14, 2008]. examined the role of communicating intent. In the study, company commanders received a battalion order including the battalion Commander's intent. Then changes to the situation were introduced and the actions performed by the company commanders were compared with the intent of the battalion commander. The result was that the company commanders matched their battalion commander's intent in only 34% of the cases. Pigeau and McCann (2000) introduced that intent consists of an explicit part and an implicit part. Explicit intent is the one that is publicly stated for all the headquarters (HQ) staff and subordinates to perceive, think about, and act upon. The explicit intent is either vocalized (i.e. made publicly) in doctrine, orders, statements or can be derived from questions and answers. Theoretically, each staff and subordinate member should be able to reiterate the commander's intent at any point during the process. Implicit intent consists of all the un-vocalized expectations that the commander and all team members have. The implicit intent is developed over a longer time, prior to the mission, and develops from the style of how the commander is conducting the operations with respect to experience, risk willing, use of power and force, diplomacy, ethics, social values, moral, norms, creativity and unorthodox behaviour and the concepts, policies, laws and doctrine agreed to by military, civil, organizations, agencies, nations and coalitions. Farell and Lichacz (2004) proposed that implicit intent is an internal expectation of Commander's intent. The example used by Farell & Lichacz (2004) is that with an explicit intent ‚Äúto capture the hill‚Äù the implicit intent might be ‚Äúto capture the hill with minimal battle damage‚Äù or ‚Äúto capture the hill with Air Force assets only.‚Äù The implicit expectations depend on how the members interpret Commander's intent from personal expectations based on their style and experience, (Pigeau & McCann 2000), and with the staff position (e.g., planner, operator, commander, etc.), (cf. Farrell & Lichacz 2004). Farell and Lichacz (2004) provided a way of finding implicit intent by asking questions of the form ‚Äúfrom perspective x, how do you interpret Commander‚Äôs intent?‚Äù Implicit intent can be made explicit by transforming the implicit into explicit statements. The commander can vocalize the Personal, Military or Cultural implicit intent. The commander can be monitored, e.g. by his subordinates, and his team members, who then draw conclusions about the commanders implicit intent. In the same way a commander can draw conclusions regarding his subordinates. Pigeau and McCann (2000) presented some mechanisms of making original implicit intent made explicit. They are: (1) Externalization is when a commander or subordinate make the internal intents explicit declared; (2) Internalization is a version of tacit learning, when a commander presents the intent and the mouth is saying something and the body language signals something different, or add context and meaning that are put into the mental model and affects the implicit intent; (3) Socialization is meeting and talking and performing exercises together, teaming, i.e. is to find the implicit intent and motives etc.; and (4) Dialogue is the explicit stated, publicly vocalized available description of an individual's intent.

Retrieved 8 January 2020 was a British motorcycle retailer who later became a motorcycle sidecar racer, motorcycle designer, constructor and retailer of accessories. In 1992 he was involved in running the Norton Rotary race team. Early days Seeley was born in Crayford, Kent. Leaving school at fourteen, he started riding on his handyman-father Percy's Vincent Rapide when he obtained his licence at sixteen, beginning his working motorcycle career as an apprentice for Harcourt Motorcycles, becoming acquainted with Bernie Ecclestone at his nearby used motorcycle salesroom, followed by Halfords motorists' shop, both in Bexleyheath, Kent, and then as a mechanic for a driving school where Seeley also learned to drive a car. Another move was to the Schwieso Brothers bike business in Dartford, Kent where he gained experience working with many different marques, also repairing and maintaining bikes in his spare time working in a wooden shed at his parents' home, using his bedroom to store parts.Coiln Seeley Racer and the rest Volume 1 at Google Books Retrieved 2014-09-30 In 1954, after being rejected for National Service as unfit, Seeley had aspirations to own his own motorcycle business, securing rented premises in the Old Forge, a car garage at Stapley Road in Belvedere, Kent. Whilst his father Percy had progressed from Series A Rapide through Series C Shadow to a Black Lightning, Colin was using a Matchless V-twin sidevalve with a large box sidecar to transport motorcycles signwritten with advertising for his business. In 1956 Seeley established his first retail shop in nearby Nuxley Road, where, with his father Percy, they traded as C.J.Seeley (Sales) Ltd., Motorcycle Specialist, keeping the Old Forge site for service and repairs. As agencies were difficult to obtain, Seeley started with sub-agencies (under the main-dealer umbrella) from Z√ºndapp, NSU and Moto Rumi, also selling bicycles, clothing and accessories, later being appointed as main agents for AJS, Ariel, BMW, Francis-Barnett, Greeves and Matchless. Further expansion in 1958 saw a nearby new showroom, again in Nuxley Road, dedicated to selling and fitting sidecars. Racing background When Seeley was fourteen he would cycle to the nearest local race track, Brands Hatch, which had then converted from grass track to hard surface, where he was impressed by Vincent Motorcycles employee Ted Davis racing his Vincent sidecar outfit. Seeley entered his first race in 1954 at Brands Hatch, a one-hour endurance event, riding a solo 500 cc BSA Star Twin borrowed from a friend, where he completed 42 laps during the hour. Pressure of work prevented any further competition until 1957 when Seeley entered his first scramble on a part-exchanged Triumph twin, followed by grass track, hill climb and Ramsgate sprint using the same machine. By 1958 Seeley had acquired an AJS agency and purchased an ex-works 500 cc scrambler which he was uneasy with; also holding a Greeves agency, Seeley approached the factory for support and rode scramblers for them in 1958 and 1959. In 1960, Seeley with his friend ‚Äì mechanic and employee Wally Rawlings ‚Äì bought their first sidecar outfit, and ex-Eric Oliver machine based on a Manx Norton, entering their first race at Snetterton in April 1960. With only one other entry accepted during 1960 ‚Äì at Charterhall in Scotland, 400 miles from his base in Kent ‚Äì Seeley was disillusioned with the race-regulating bodies. In late 1960, as a rider-agent, Seeley managed to convince the AMC factory to sell him a new Matchless G50 solo race bike to be modified and used with a Canterbury racing sidecar, for which Seeley was an agent. After some encouraging results on local tracks, Seeley entered his first Grand Prix event, the Isle of Man TT in 1961, finishing in sixth place.IOM TT 1961 Race Sidecar result Retrieved 2014-09-30 BMW RS54 Rennsport 500cc engine showing low flat-twin design, camshaft drive, Dell'Orto carburettors and gearbox output coupling to shaft final driveSeeley raced in the British and world championship sidecar competitions between 1961 and 1967.

The 1967 URS 500 cc four cylinder intended for Grands Prix racing was initially ridden by John Blanchard, but the Seeley-frame aspect of the project (provided by Colin Seeley Race Developments) ran into problems with personalities and by the sudden use of a non-Seeley front-brake from rival Rickman Brothers, resulting in Colin Seeley confiscating his rolling chassis less the brake, caused the Fath (URS) team to use a Rickman Metisse frame from 1968 onwards, a successful Grands Prix machine campaigned by German Karl Hoppe.

Seeley went on to develop in 1971 a roadster based on the Matchless G50 engine called the Seeley Condor. During the late 1960s and early 1970s when almost all the major motorcycle manufacturers had pulled out of Grand Prix racing, the Seeley- designed chassis became the race bike of choice for privateer racers of the era. John Cooper won the 500cc class at the 1968 North West 200, while Brian Ball finished second to Giacomo Agostini in the Senior TT at the 1968 Isle of Man TT, both riders on a Seeley-Matchless. At the 1969 North West 200, John Blanchard and Brian Steenson placed first and second in the 500 class aboard Seeley-designed motorcycles. In the 1969 Isle of Man TT, Seeley placed four of his machines in the top ten in the Senior TT race with third, fourth, sixth and seventh-place finishes. His best result as a constructor came in 1970 when Tommy Robb rode one of his machines to a fourth-place finish in the 500cc world championship. Seeley later used other Japanese engines in his chassis, most notably using a Hi-Tac Suzuki T500 engine for Barry Sheene in 1971. Sheene used the bike to win the British national championship and declared it the best-handling motorcycle he had ever ridden. His designs proved so successful in competition that he earned a reputation as one of the best motorcycle frame designers in the industry. In the 1970s, Seeley moved to automobile racing when Bernie Ecclestone hired him as joint Managing Director of Motor Racing Developments to work on Brabham racing car production, and in 1986 with the Brabham Formula One team. =Road bikes and others= Seeley Honda (1977) Following on from the Condor roadster, during the mid-1970s Seeley - under the name Colin Seeley International - produced a special, lightweight, single-seat sporting road bike with Honda CB750 750 cc SOHC engine and front forks, featuring his own fuel tank, seat and exhausts. \\"Colin Seeley; Racer and the Rest Volume Two\\" Google Books.

Education and career He finished his school education at the European School, Munich and studied psychology and biology at the University of Konstanz, the Ruhr University Bochum, University of Massachusetts Boston, the Shepens eye research Institute of the Harvard Medical School as well as with Marvin Minsky at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then started his research career at the University of St Andrews by investigating cells in the temporal cortex with David Perrett, and described cells that respond when the monkey views particular faces in a way that correlates with conscious perception. After that, he moved to the University of Parma where he was part of the team that discovered auditory mirror neurons in the frontal cortex of the macaque monkey. He then expanded the notion of mirror neurons to emotions and sensations, by showing that your somatosensory cortex is active not only when you are being touched, but also if you see someone else being touched, and that your insular cortex is active not only if you feel disgusted, but also if you see someone else being disgusted. More recently, he has looked at the neural basis of abnormal empathy in schizophrenia, autism and psychopathy. Currently, Keysers is a full Professor for the Social Brain at the Brain and Cognition program of the University of Amsterdam and he co-leads the Social Brain Lab of the prestigious Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. He has recently published a book called 'The Empathic Brain'.  Research career  He has collaborated with the French neuroimaging specialist Bruno Wicker, in using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and showed for the first time, that the secondary somatosensory cortex, previously thought only to represent a persons own experiences of touch, is also activated when seeing someone or something else be touched. They also showed that the insula, thought only to respond to the experience of first-hand emotions, was also activated when we see another individual experience similar emotions. Together this indicated a much more general principle than the original mirror neuron theory, in which people process the actions, sensations and emotions of others by vicariously activating one‚Äôs own actions, sensations and emotions. Jointly, this work laid the foundation of the neuroscientific investigation of empathy. At the University of Groningen, the team also demonstrated that rats show empathy for the others.

She worked for her father, the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell, until his death in 1991 when she moved to the United States and became a close associate of Epstein. In 2020, she was charged by the US federal government with the crimes of enticement of minors and sex trafficking of underage girls. Maxwell founded the self-described ocean-advocacy group The TerraMar Project in 2012. The organisation announced cessation of operations on 12 July 2019, a week after the sex trafficking charges brought by New York federal prosecutors against Epstein became public. The US Virgin Islands Department of Justice announced on 10 July 2020 that Maxwell was also under investigation in the Caribbean territory.  Early life  Headington Hill Hall Ghislaine Maxwell was born in 1961, in Maisons-Laffitte, France, the ninth and youngest child of Elisabeth (n√©e Meynard), a French-born scholar, and Robert Maxwell, a Czechoslovak-born British media proprietor. Her father was from a Jewish family and her mother was of Huguenot descent. Maxwell was born two days before a car accident that left her 15-year-old brother Michael in a prolonged coma until his death in 1967. Her mother later reflected that the accident had an effect on the entire family, and surmised that Ghislaine had shown signs of anorexia while still a toddler. Throughout childhood, Ghislaine resided with her family in Oxford at Headington Hill Hall, a 53-room mansion, where the offices of Pergamon Press, a publishing company run by Robert Maxwell, were also located. Her mother said all her children were brought up as Anglicans. Maxwell attended Marlborough College, and Balliol College, Oxford. Maxwell had a close relationship with her father and was widely credited with being her father's favourite. According to Tatler, Maxwell recalled that her father installed computers at Headington in 1973 and her first job was training to use a Wang and later programming code. The Times reported that he did not permit Ghislaine to bring her boyfriends home or to be seen with them publicly, after she started attending Oxford University.  Career  Maxwell was a prominent member of the London social scene in the 1980s. She founded a women's club named after the original Kit-Cat Club and was a director of Oxford United Football Club during her father's ownership.\\"Profile of Ghislaine Maxwell\\" , Walker's ResearchDavid Crabtree, et al \\"A History of Oxford United Football Club\\" , OUFC website, 8 March 2011 She also worked at The European, a publication Robert Maxwell had started. According to Tom Bower, writing for The Sunday Times, in 1986 Robert invited her to the christening in her honour of his new yacht the Lady Ghislaine, at a shipyard in the Netherlands. Maxwell spent a large amount of time in the late 1980s aboard the yacht, which was equipped with a Jacuzzi, sauna, gym and disco. The Scotsman said Robert Maxwell had also \\"tailor-made a New York company for her\\". The company, which dealt in corporate gifts, was not profitable. The Sunday Times reported that Maxwell flew to New York on 5November 1990 to deliver an envelope on her father's behalf that, unknown to her, was part of \\"a plot initiated by her father to steal $200m\\" from Berlitz shareholders. The Dancing Hare yacht, formerly known as the Lady Ghislaine After Maxwell's father purchased the New York Daily News in January 1991, he sent her to New York City to act as his emissary. In May 1991, Maxwell and her father took Concorde on business to New York, where he quickly departed for Moscow and left her to represent his interests at an event honouring Simon Wiesenthal. In November 1991, Robert Maxwell's body was found floating in the sea near the Canary Islands and the Lady Ghislaine.\\"Family Misfortunes\\", 21 January 1996, The Observer, page 14 Soon afterwards, Ghislaine flew to Tenerife, where the yacht was berthed, to attend to his business paperwork. Ghislaine attended her father's funeral in Jerusalem alongside various Israeli intelligence figures, president Chaim Herzog, and prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, who gave his eulogy. Although a verdict of death by accidental drowning was recorded, Maxwell has since said she believes her father was murdered, commenting in 1997, \\"He did not commit suicide. That was just not consistent with his character. I think he was murdered.\\"\\"Soundbites\\", The Observer, 23 February 1997 After his death, Robert Maxwell was found to have fraudulently appropriated the pension assets of Mirror Group Newspapers, a company that he ran and in which he held a large share of ownership, to support its share price. There were reportedly over ¬£440m in pension funds missing, which left the surviving Maxwell family members and the British government in a bind to repay the 32,000 people affected. Two of Maxwell's brothers, Ian and Kevin, who were the most involved with their father in daily business dealings, were arrested on 19 June 1992 and charged with fraud related to the Mirror Group pension scandal. The brothers were acquitted of the charges three and a half years later in January 1996. Maxwell moved to the United States in 1991, just after her father's death. She was photographed boarding a Concorde to cross the Atlantic, causing outrage amidst the pension scandal due to the high cost of the flight. Maxwell was provided with an annual income of ¬£80,000 thanks to a trust fund established in Liechtenstein by her father. By 1992, she had moved to an apartment of an Iranian friend overlooking Central Park. At the time, Maxwell worked at a real estate office on Madison Avenue and was reported to be socialising with celebrities. She quickly rose to wider prominence as a New York City socialite.  Relationship with Jeffrey Epstein  Accounts differ on when Maxwell first met American financier Jeffrey Epstein. According to Epstein's former business partner, Steven Hoffenberg, Robert Maxwell introduced his daughter to Epstein in the late 1980s. The Times reported that Maxwell met Epstein in the early 1990s at a New York party following \\"a difficult break-up with Count Gianfranco Cicogna Mozzoni\\" (1962‚Äì2012) of the CIGA Hotels clan. Maxwell had a romantic relationship with Epstein for several years in the early 1990s and remained closely associated with him for decades. The nature of their relationship remains unclear. In a 2009 deposition, several of Epstein's household employees testified that Epstein referred to her as his \\"main girlfriend\\" who also hired, fired, and supervised his staff, starting around 1992. She has also been referred to as the \\"Lady of the House\\" by Epstein's staff and as his \\"aggressive assistant\\". In a 2003 Vanity Fair profile on Epstein, author Vicky Ward said Epstein referred to Maxwell as \\"my best friend\\". Ward also observed that Maxwell seemed \\"to organize much of his life\\". Politico reported that Maxwell and Epstein had friendships with several prominent individuals in elite circles of politics, academia, business and law, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, attorney Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew. 2006 mugshot of Epstein Maxwell is known for her longstanding friendship with Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and for having escorted him to a \\"hookers and pimps\\" social function in New York. She introduced Epstein to Prince Andrew, and the three often socialised together. In 2000, Maxwell and Epstein attended a party thrown by Prince Andrew at the Queen's Sandringham House estate in Norfolk, England, reportedly for Maxwell's 39th birthday. In a November 2019 interview with the BBC, Prince Andrew confirmed that Maxwell and Epstein had attended an event at his invitation, but he denied that it was anything more than a \\"straightforward shooting weekend\\". In 1995, Epstein renamed one of his companies the Ghislaine Corporation; based in Palm Beach, Florida, the company was dissolved in 1998. As a trained helicopter pilot, Maxwell also transported Epstein to his private Caribbean island. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting a minor for prostitution and served 13 months of an 18-month jail sentence. Following Epstein's release, although Maxwell continued to attend prominent social functions, she and Epstein were no longer seen together publicly. By late 2015, Maxwell had largely retreated from attending social functions. = Civil cases and accusations =  Virginia Roberts Giuffre v. Maxwell (2015)  Details of a civil lawsuit, made public in January 2015, contained a deposition from \\"Jane Doe3\\" that accused Maxwell of recruiting her in 1999, when she was a minor, and grooming her to provide sexual services for Epstein. A 2018 expos√© by Julie K. Brown in the Miami Herald revealed Jane Doe3 to be Virginia Giuffre, who was previously known as Virginia Roberts. Giuffre met Maxwell at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where Giuffre was working at the time. She asserted that Maxwell had introduced her to Epstein, after which she was \\"groomed by the two [of them] for his pleasure, including lessons in Epstein's preferences during oral sex\\". Maxwell has repeatedly denied any involvement in Epstein's crimes. In a 2015 statement, Maxwell rejected allegations that she has acted as a procurer for Epstein and denied that she had \\"facilitated Prince Andrew's [alleged] acts of sexual abuse\\". Her spokesperson said \\"the allegations made against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue\\" and she \\"strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British press and elsewhere, and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims\\". Giuffre asserted that Maxwell and Epstein had trafficked her and other underage girls, often at sex parties hosted by Epstein at his homes in New York, New Mexico, Palm Beach, and the US Virgin Islands. Maxwell called her a liar. Giuffre sued Maxwell for defamation in federal court in the Southern District of New York in 2015. While details of the settlement have not been made public, in May 2017 the case was settled in Giuffre's favour, with Maxwell paying Giuffre \\"millions\\".  Sarah Ransome v. Epstein and Maxwell (2017)  In 2017, Sarah Ransome filed a suit, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, against Epstein and Maxwell, alleging that Maxwell hired her to give massages to Epstein and later threatened to physically harm her or destroy her career prospects if she did not comply with their sexual demands at his mansion in New York and on his private Caribbean island, Little Saint James. The suit was settled in 2018 under undisclosed terms.  Affidavit filed by Maria Farmer (2019)  On 16 April 2019, Maria Farmer went public and filed a sworn affidavit in federal court in New York, alleging that she and her 15-year-old sister, Annie, had been sexually assaulted by Epstein and Maxwell in separate locations in 1996. Farmer's affidavit was filed in support of a defamation suit between Virginia Giuffre against Alan Dershowitz. According to the affidavit, Farmer had met Maxwell and Epstein at a New York art gallery reception in 1995. The affidavit says that in the summer of the following year, they hired her to work on an art project in billionaire businessman Leslie Wexner's Ohio mansion, where she was then sexually assaulted by both Maxwell and Epstein. Farmer reported the incident to the New York Police Department and the FBI. Her affidavit also stated that during the same summer, Epstein flew her then 15-year-old sister, Annie, to his New Mexico property where he and Maxwell molested her on a massage table. Farmer was interviewed for CBS This Morning in November 2019 where she detailed the 1996 assault and alleged that Maxwell had repeatedly threatened both her career and her life after the assault.  Jennifer Araoz v. Epstein's estate, Maxwell, and Jane Does 1‚Äì3 (2019)  On 14 August 2019, Jennifer Araoz filed a lawsuit in New York County Supreme Court against Epstein's estate, Maxwell, and three unnamed members of his staff; the lawsuit was made possible under New York state's new Child Victims Act, which took effect on the same date. Araoz later amended her complaint on 8 October 2019 with the names of the previously unidentified women enablers to include Lesley Groff, Cimberly Espinosa, and the late Rosalyn Fontanilla.  Priscilla Doe v. Epstein's estate (2019)  Ghislaine Maxwell was named in one of three lawsuits filed in New York on 20 August 2019 against the estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The woman filing the suit, identified as \\"Priscilla Doe\\", claimed that she was recruited in 2006 and trained by Maxwell with step-by-step instructions on how to provide sexual services for Epstein.  Annie Farmer v. Maxwell and Epstein's Estate (2019)  Annie Farmer, represented by David Boies, sued Maxwell and Epstein's estate in Federal District Court in Manhattan in November 2019, accusing them of rape, battery and false imprisonment and seeking unspecified damages.  Jane Doe v. Maxwell and Epstein's Estate (2020)  In January 2020, a lawsuit was filed against Maxwell and Epstein alleging that they recruited a 13-year-old music student at the Interlochen Center for the Arts in the summer of 1994 and subjected her to sexual abuse. The suit states that Jane Doe was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Epstein over a four-year period and that Maxwell played a key role both in her recruitment and by participating in the assaults. According to the lawsuit, Jane Doe was targeted by Epstein and Maxwell for being fatherless and from a struggling family, in much the same manner as many of the other alleged victims.  Maxwell v. Epstein's Estate, Darren K. Indyke, Richard D. Kahn, and NES LLC (2020)  On 12 March 2020 Maxwell filed a lawsuit in Superior Court in the US Virgin Islands seeking compensation from Epstein's estate for her legal costs. Maxwell claimed she had been a longtime employee of Epstein (from 1998 to 2006) who had served to manage his property holdings in the US Virgin Islands, New York, New Mexico, Florida and Paris while continuing to deny any knowledge or involvement in his criminal activities. According to the lawsuit, Maxwell was seeking damages for the legal fees associated with defending herself against her accusers, expenses that she claims Epstein had promised to cover for her. = Dispute over release of court documents = On 2 July 2019, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered the unsealing of documents from the earlier civil suit against Maxwell by Virginia Giuffre. Jeffrey Epstein was arrested on 6July 2019 at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and charged with sex trafficking and sex trafficking conspiracy. Maxwell requested a rehearing in a federal appeals court on 17 July 2019, in an effort to keep documents sealed that were part of a suit by Giuffre. On 9August 2019 the first batch of documents were unsealed and released from the earlier defamation suit by Giuffre against Maxwell. Epstein was found dead on 10 August 2019, after reportedly hanging himself in his Manhattan prison cell. Maxwell and her lawyers continued to argue against the further release of court documents in December 2019. Reuters confirmed on 27 December 2019 that Maxwell was under investigation by the FBI for facilitating Epstein's criminal activities. Additional documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell defamation suit were released on 30 July 2020. The documents included a deposition given by Giuffre and more recent email exchanges between Maxwell and Epstein, with some of the correspondence from 2015. = Attempts to locate Maxwell to serve court documents = On 27 December 2019, Reuters reported that Maxwell was among those under FBI investigation for facilitating Epstein. After his arrest, Maxwell was in hiding, communicating with the courts only through her lawyers who, as of 30 January 2020, had refused to accept on her behalf service of three lawsuits against her. The New York Times said that by 2016 Maxwell was no longer being photographed at events. By 2017, her lawyers claimed before a judge that they did not know her address; they further stated that she was in London but they did not believe she had a permanent residence. Maxwell has a history of being unreachable during legal proceedings. During the lawsuit filed in 2017 from Ransome against Maxwell, District Judge John G. Koeltl granted a motion for \\"alternative service\\" on the grounds that the plaintiff's efforts to reach Maxwell were persistently thwarted; these included hiring a private investigation firm that attempted service at three physical addresses, sending information to several email addresses, and reaching out to the lawyers actively representing Maxwell in another lawsuit who refused to become a \\"general agent of process\\" to relay the information to her. According to court documents from a lawsuit filed by Epstein against Bradley Edwards (a representative for several of his accusers), in 2010 Maxwell had agreed to provide a deposition in the case but reportedly left the country one day before Edwards was scheduled to fly to New York to take her deposition, \\"claiming she needed to return to the UK to be with her deathly ill mother\\" with no intention of returning to the United States. However, Maxwell returned within a month to attend Chelsea Clinton's wedding. In January 2020, it was reported that Maxwell had refused to allow her lawyers to be served with several lawsuits in which she has been directly named in 2019 and 2020, including one by Farmer and from Araoz. While Maxwell's lawyers continued to argue on her behalf against the release of additional court documents from the Giuffre v. Maxwell lawsuit, they claimed to not know where she is or to have permission to accept the recent lawsuits filed against her. Authorities in the United States Virgin Islands (USVI) were unsuccessful in locating Maxwell during the three and a half months they were seeking to serve her with a subpoena. USVI prosecutors consider Maxwell to be a \\"critical fact witness\\" in their lawsuit against Epstein's estate. A court filing from the USVI Department of Justice, released on 10 July 2020, stated that Maxwell was also under investigation for her alleged participation in Epstein's sex trafficking operation in the Virgin Islands. = Arrest and indictment = Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn Maxwell faced persistent allegations of procuring and sexually trafficking underage girls for Epstein and others, charges she has denied. Maxwell was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire by the FBI on 2 July 2020 and charged with enticement of minors, sex trafficking of children, and perjury. On 14 July 2020, a New York federal judge denied Maxwell bail after determining that her risks of fleeing \\"are simply too great\\". Southern District of New York prosecutors charged her with six federal crimes, including enticement of minors, sex trafficking, and perjury. The indictment charged that between 1994 and 1997, she ‚Äúassisted, facilitated, and contributed\\" to the abuse of minor girls despite knowing that one of three unnamed victims was 14 years old. , Maxwell is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn, New York. Lawyers requested that the judge release her on $5 million bond with monitored home confinement while awaiting trial. Maxwell appeared by video link before a court in Manhattan on 14 July 2020. She pleaded not guilty to the charges. A naturalised US citizen since 2002 who also holds passports from France and the United Kingdom, Maxwell was denied bail as a flight risk amid concerns regarding her \\"completely opaque\\" finances, her skill at living in hiding, and the fact that France does not extradite its citizens. Her lawyers argued unsuccessfully that she was at risk of catching COVID-19 in detention. The judge set a date for the trial of 12 July 2021; the trial is expected to last for approximately two weeks.  TerraMar Project  In 2012, Maxwell founded The TerraMar Project, a nonprofit organisation that advocated the protection of oceans. She gave a lecture for TerraMar at the University of Texas at Dallas and a TED talk, at TEDx Charlottesville in 2014. Maxwell accompanied Stuart Beck, a 2013 TerraMar board member, to two United Nations meetings to discuss the project. The TerraMar Project announced closure on 12 July 2019, less than a week after the charges of sex trafficking brought by New York federal prosecutors against Epstein became public. An associated, UK-based company, Terramar (UK), listed Maxwell as a director. An application for the UK organisation to be closed was made on 4September 2019, with the first notice in The London Gazette made on 17 September 2019. The company Terramar (UK) was listed as officially dissolved on 3December 2019.  Personal life  Since at least 1997, Maxwell has maintained a residence in Belgravia, London. In 2000, Maxwell moved into a townhouse on East 65th Street, New York City, less than 10blocks from Epstein's mansion. Maxwell's townhouse was purchased for $4.95million by an anonymous limited liability company, with an address that matches the office of J. Epstein & Co. Representing the buyer was Darren Indyke, Epstein's longtime lawyer. In April 2016, the New York townhouse where she had lived was sold for $15 million. Following her personal and professional involvement with Epstein, Maxwell was romantically linked for several years to Ted Waitt, founder of Gateway computers. She attended the wedding of Chelsea Clinton in 2010 as Waitt's guest. Maxwell helped Waitt obtain and renovate a luxury yacht, the Plan B, and used it for travel to France and Croatia before their relationship ended, in late 2010 or early 2011. On 15 August 2019, reports surfaced that Maxwell had been living in Manchester-by-the-Sea, Massachusetts, in the home of Scott Borgerson, the CEO of CargoMetrics, a hedge fund investment company involved in maritime data analytics. Maxwell and Borgerson were described as having been in a romantic relationship for several years. Locals in the town of Manchester-by-the-Sea said Maxwell had kept a low profile, went by \\"G\\" instead of her full first name, and had been seen on several occasions walking a Vizsla dog along the beach. Borgerson and Maxwell filed documents in Massachusetts Land Court about Borgerson's residence, known as Phippin House, during a civil dispute with neighbours regarding rescinded access rights to the larger Sharksmouth Estate in 2019. A neighbouring property manager attested that Maxwell and Borgerson were living together at the property in question. Others have said they had been seen repeatedly running together in the mornings. Borgerson stated in August 2019 that Maxwell was not currently living at the home and that he did not know where she was. Also on 15 August 2019, the New York Post published photographs of Maxwell dining at a fast-food restaurant in Los Angeles, claiming that \\"The Post found the socialite hiding in plain sight in the least likely place imaginable ‚Äî a fast-food joint in Los Angeles\\". The photos were later proven to have been taken at a meeting with Maxwell's friend and attorney Leah Saffian, who also gave other pictures to the Daily Mail. Maxwell moved to a remote property in Bradford, New Hampshire in late 2019, where she used former British military personnel as personal security until her arrest in July 2020. At the time of her arraignment, Federal prosecutors stated that Maxwell is married; she did not disclose the identity of her spouse (or their respective finances).

ACBP is also known as diazepam binding inhibitor (DBI) or endozepine (EP) because of its ability to displace diazepam from the benzodiazepine (BZD) recognition site located on the GABA type A receptor. It is therefore possible that this protein also acts as a neuropeptide to modulate the action of the GABA receptor. ACBP is a highly conserved protein of about 90 amino acids that is found in all four eukaryotic kingdoms, Animalia, Plantae, Fungi and Protista, and in some eubacterial species. Although ACBP occurs as a completely independent protein, intact ACB domains have been identified in a number of large, multifunctional proteins in a variety of eukaryotic species. These include large membrane-associated proteins with N-terminal ACB domains, multifunctional enzymes with both ACB and peroxisomal enoyl-CoA Delta(3), Delta(2)-enoyl-CoA isomerase domains, and proteins with both an ACB domain and ankyrin repeats. The ACB domain consists of four alpha-helices arranged in a bowl shape with a highly exposed acyl-CoA-binding site. The ligand is bound through specific interactions with residues on the protein, most notably several conserved positive charges that interact with the phosphate group on the adenosine-3'phosphate moiety, and the acyl chain is sandwiched between the hydrophobic surfaces of CoA and the protein. Other proteins containing an ACB domain include: * Endozepine-like peptide (ELP) (gene DBIL5) from mouse. ELP is a testis-specific ACBP homologue that may be involved in the energy metabolism of the mature sperm. *MA-DBI, a transmembrane protein of unknown function which has been found in mammals. MA-DBI contains a N-terminal ACB domain. *DRS-1, a human protein of unknown function that contains a N-terminal ACB domain and a C-terminal enoyl-CoA isomerase/hydratase domain.

He is also described as a scribe who records events, and a boatman who takes Enlil to his future wife, Ninlil. His shrine was recorded to be in the Ekur. Later, In Babylonia and Assyria, he became the light and fire god, indistinguishable from Girru (formerly Gibil).  Later influence  The cuneiform inscription on this symbolic base reads \\"Cult pedestal of the god Nusku, the grand vizier, the temple E-kur...\\", 13th century BCE. From Assur, Iraq. Pergamon Museum In Babylonia and Assyria Nuska is the symbol of the heavenly as well as of the terrestrial fire. As the former he is the son of Anu, the god of heaven, but he is likewise associated with Enlil of Nippur as the god of the earth and regarded as a first-born son. A centre of his cult in Assyria was in Harran, where, because of the predominance of the moon-cult, he is viewed as the son of the moongod Sin and his wife Ningal, though Nuska was with Enlil when Sin wasn't born yet, and Enlil hadn't married Ninlil‚ÄîSin's mother. Nuska is by the side of Ea, the god of water, the great purifier. It is he, therefore, who is called upon to cleanse the sick and suffering from disease, which, induced by the demons, was looked upon as a species of impurity affecting the body. The fire-god is also viewed as the patron of the arts and the god of civilization in general, because of the natural association of all human progress with the discovery and use of fire. As among other nations, the fire-god was in the third instance looked upon as the protector of the family. He becomes the mediator between humanity and the gods, since it is through the fire on the altar that the offering is brought into the presence of the gods. While temples and sanctuaries to Nusku-Girru are found in Babylonia and Assyria, he is worshipped more in symbolical form than the other gods. For the very reason that his presence is common and universal he is not localized to the same extent as his fellow deities, and, while always enumerated in a list of the great gods, his place in the systematized pantheon is more or less vague. The conceptions connected with Nuska are of distinctly popular origin, as is shown by his prominence in incantations, which represent the popular element in the cult, and it is significant that in the astro-theological system of the Assyrian and Babylonian priests Nusku-Girru is not assigned to any particular place in the heavens. Nusku is revered in the name of Mutakkil-Nusku (\\"he whom Nusku endows with confidence,\\") a 12th-century BC king of Assyria.

The village is situated from Madurai. Though Madapuram is near Madurai it is within Sivagangai district. The famous Madurapuram Badhrakali amman and ayyanar temple is situated at this place. Today this temple is managed by HR&CE; ministry of Government of Tamil Nadu. Madurapuram kali is believed to be the Kaval deivams of Madurai Pandyan king. The temple has no roof. Madapuram kali is very famous here she stands with no roof and about high. Ammavasya days will be very crowded with people pray with lemon mala and archani. The Rajagopuram (the tower) of Bathirakaliamman temple is of five tiers. The Goddess amman idol is high and is guarded on both sides by two Boothas (demons). A horse statue high stands raising its legs over this idol. Bathirakaliamman holds a trident and has a crown of fire. People consider the temple to be a court of justice. It is common that at a small platform outside the temple people seek justice from the Goddess. They come in wet clothes, state their complaint and cut a coin and put it on a sacred place \\"Pattyakkal\\" installed here. They believe that by doing this they receive justice and the person against whom the complaint is lodged will be punished appropriately by the Goddess. The Thala virutcham is a Neem tree. The temple has two theerthams, namely Brahmma Gundam and Manikarni theertham. The temple is open from 6.00a.m. until 8.00p.m. History Before 2300 years back, this place was surrounded by thick thorn forest. During that period, Trimurti along with Goddess Gowri went for hunting. Lord Shiva asked Parvathy not to come along with them. As Parvathy doesn't wished to stay alone, Lord Shiva created a child named \\"Ayyanar\\" to accompany her. She requested Lord Shiva to make this place as a holy one and Lord shiva accepted her wish and made this place holy by informing that taking bath in Vaigai river within 3 km from this place is spiritually equivalent to taking bath in Kasi, the holy water. Goddess Parvathy stayed here as KALI and When a devotee asked a wish to her, she ordered him to provide a horse-shaped shadow for her standing posture. Lifting his two legs, he provided shadow and from that day onwards, Goddess Kali blessed the devotees in this form. There is another ancient history for this temple. Once upon a time the city Madurai was surrounded by flood. As Goddess Meenakshi asked to show the boundary of Madurai, Lord Adishesha showed the boundary by covering the area with its head and tail and this place was known as Padapuram (Padam-Face of the snake and Puram-Back of the snake) and in later days, it became Madapuram.

Thirupuvanam is situated just 1 km from Madapuram. The temple is one of 275 Siva Devera sthalams. The Main Deity is Poornanadhar Goddess Soundra Nayaki in separate sanctum. Sthala Vruksham is Jack Fruit. Teertham is Mnikarnigai River and Vaigi River. Dharmayagnan wanted to mix his father‚Äôs ash in Sethuk karai. As he was proceeding he happened to cross this place where the ashes turned to flowers. This place is considered equal to Kasi. Brahma, Thirumal, Surya, Naradha, Thirumagal, and Nala Maharaja worshipped Lord Siva of this place. Sambandhar, Thirunavukkarasar, and Sundarar sang hymns on Siva of this place. Before the 7th century AD in Tamil Nadu, Jainism and Buddhism were the dominant religions. During that period the four great Saivaite Quartet restores the pristine glory of Saivism. They traveled far and wide in the Pandya kingdom extolling and singing the glory of God. There are 14 Shrines where their songs are available. These 14 Shrines in the Pandiya Kingdom are known as Pandi-14. Amongst the 14 Shrines, Madurai, the Capital of the Pandiya Kingdom is the most ancient. But the city was ravaged due to the war of Lord Indra, the curse of Kannagi, which consumed Madurai, and the spate in the river Vaigai was brought back to life again and again but the only Shrine which maintains its ancient glory is Thirupuvanam. It is said that Goddess Parvati, to expiate from her sin, sat under the Parijatha Tree for Penance. The glories of the Thirupuvanam are narrated in Brahma-vaivarta puranam (Sanskrit). And it was translated in the Tamil Language and named as \\"Thirupuvana Puranam\\" by Kandasamy Pulavar. More over the glories of Thirupuvanam are narrated in 3 episodes in Thiruvillaiyadar Puranam of Paranjothi Munivar.

Ms McArdle was the Ministerial Special Adviser to Sinn F√©in Culture Minister Car√°l N√≠ Chuil√≠n and previously an IRA member, convicted of murder in 1984. Her appointment to the position was controversial because of her conviction for the murder of Mary Travers. Murder of Mary Travers Two male members of the IRA approached Resident Magistrate Tom Travers, his wife, and daughter, Mary, as they left Mass. Travers was shot six times and his daughter shot once through the back. One gunman brought his gun to point-blank range at Mrs. Travers face and fired twice, but the gun jammed. According to the Belfast Telegraph McArdle, then aged nineteen, was arrested shortly after the attack and charged \\"after two hand guns, a grey wig and a black sock concealed in bandages were found strapped to her thighs.\\" Two months later thirty-three-year-old IRA member Joseph Patrick Haughey, was arrested and charged in connection with the attack. At the trial two years later, McArdle was found guilty and received \\"a life sentence for her role in the murder of Mary Travers and an 18-year concurrent sentence for the attempted murder of Mr Travers.\\" Haughey was acquitted due to lack of forensic evidence and doubts over his identity, though Tom Travers positively identified him in a line-up. McArdle served 14 years in prison before being released early under the terms of the Belfast Agreement. Special Adviser appointment Following outrage at her appointment in 2011, Ms. McArdle expressed remorse for the murder of Travers, calling it \\"a tragic mistake\\". McArdle's statement was rebutted by Mary Travers' sister, Anne, who stated: Her brother, Paul Travers, who now lives in Australia, said to the Belfast Telegraph in July 2011: Travers made an open appeal to Sinn F√©in to work with the Historical Enquiries Team and determine who killed his sister: Aftermath In March 2012, Sinn F√©in stated that Ms McArdle had been moved from the post of special adviser to the Culture Minister to another post in the Party. She was replaced by Jarlath Kearney, a former journalist, who had previously worked as a Sinn F√©in policy adviser. A Sinn F√©in spokesperson said it was part of normal party policy to rotate staff.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) play a major role in carbon cycle and can be utilized as a source of carbon and energy by bacteria. Salmonella typhimurium propionate kinase (StTdcD) catalyzes reversible transfer of the Œ≥-phosphate of ATP to propionate during l-threonine degradation to propionate. Kinetic analysis revealed that StTdcD possesses broad ligand specificity and could be activated by various SCFAs (propionate>acetate‚âàbutyrate), nucleotides (ATP‚âàGTP>CTP‚âàTTP; dATP>dGTP>dCTP) and metal ions (Mg2+‚âàMn2+>Co2+). Inhibition of StTdcD by tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates such as citrate, succinate, Œ±-ketoglutarate and malate suggests that the enzyme could be under plausible feedback regulation. Crystal structures of StTdcD bound to PO4 (phosphate), AMP, ATP, Ap4 (adenosine tetraphosphate), GMP, GDP, GTP, CMP and CTP revealed that binding of nucleotide mainly involves hydrophobic interactions with the base moiety and could account for the broad biochemical specificity observed between the enzyme and nucleotides. Modelling and site-directed mutagenesis studies suggest Ala88 to be an important residue involved in determining the rate of catalysis with SCFA substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations on monomeric and dimeric forms of StTdcD revealed plausible open and closed states, and also suggested role for dimerization in stabilizing segment 235-290 involved in interfacial interactions and ligand binding. Observation of an ethylene glycol molecule bound sufficiently close to the Œ≥-phosphate in StTdcD complexes with triphosphate nucleotides supports direct in-line phosphoryl transfer. The enzyme is important in the process of glycolysis, enzyme levels being increased in the presence of excess glucose. The growth of a bacterial mutant lacking acetate kinase has been shown to be inhibited by glucose, suggesting that the enzyme is involved in excretion of excess carbohydrate. A related enzyme, butyrate kinase, facilitates the formation of butyryl-CoA by phosphorylating butyrate in the presence of ATP to form butyryl phosphate.

They are primarily Neotropical and include about 400 described species. Description and ecology The subfamily includes the sloth moths (genera Cryptoses, Bradypodicola and Bradypophila). Adults of these species live in the fur of sloths, while the caterpillar larvae feed on the sloth's dung. Other unusual Chrysauginae caterpillars have been found in Hymenoptera nests and on the spines of caterpillars of the brush-footed butterfly genus Automeris. But usually, their larvae feed on plants, boring into seed, fruits, stems and roots, or rolling and spinning leaves together to form a hideout. While the adults are fairly nondescript, Chrysauginae larvae can usually be recognized unequivocally by the sclerotised ring around seta SD1 of the metathorax. Systematics A checklist of the Chrysauginae in the Western Hemisphere was compiled by Solis et al. in 1995, but no phylogenetic analyses have been conducted. Four Australian genera were tentatively placed in this subfamily by Shaffer et al. in 1996, but study of the adults did not confirm this, and the larvae are unknown. *Abaera Walker, 1859 *Acallidia Schaus, 1913 *Acallis Ragonot, 1891 *Acutia Ragonot, 1891 *Adenopteryx Ragonot, 1891 *Ahyalosticta Amsel, 1956 *Anassodes Turner, 1932 *Anemosa Walker, 1859 (= Drymiarcha Meyrick, 1885) *Anemosella Dyar, 1914 (= Balidarcha Dyar, 1914) *Anisothrix Ragonot, 1891 *Arbinia M√∂schler, 1881 *Area Ragonot, 1891 *Arouva Walker, 1864 *Arta Grote, 1875 (= Xantippides Dyar, 1908) *Azamora Walker, 1858 (= Amblyura Lederer, 1863, Arica Walker, 1863, Thylacophora Ragonot, 1891, Torda Walker, 1863) *Basacallis Cashatt, 1969 *Bisinusia Amsel, 1956 *Blepharocerus C. √â.

Life He was born in Cow Lane (later Greek Street), Dublin, around 1729. He learnt mezzotint- engraving from John Brooks. When Brooks moved to London about 1746, MacArdell and other pupils followed. He opened a print shop at the Golden Head in Covent Garden, where in 1753 he published six views of Dublin. MacArdell died on 2 June 1765, in his fifty-seventh year, and was buried in the churchyard at Hampstead, where a stone bore an inscription to his memory. Works Portrait of the actress Hannah Pritchard, 1762 mezzotint by MacArdell after Francis Hayman. His earliest work appears to be a head of Archbishop Hugh Boulter in an engraving, altered from one by Brooks of Bishop Robert Howard. A head of Dr. Birch is stated to have been done by MacArdell in London. A portrait of Bishop Thomas Secker, engraved by MacArdell, was published in London in 1767, and also a humorous plate, entitled 'Teague's Ramble.' In 1748 he engraved a portrait of John Cartwright, after S.

Description The sandy anemone is a medium-sized anemone of up to 10 cm in diameter. It has over 300 short tentacles. Its body column is covered with sticky knobs to which sand and debris particles adhere. The species has a wide range of colours, including pink, brown, green and blue often with a contrastingly-coloured oral disc.Jones, Georgina. A field guide to the marine animals of the Cape Peninsula. SURG, Cape Town, 2008. Distribution The sandy anemone is found off the Argentinian coast and around the southern African coast from Luderitz to Durban. It inhabits waters from the intertidal to about in depth. It is found in pools on the lower shore and in crevices on rocks, often huddled into sandy gullies and round the bases of boulders. Juveniles are often found in mussel beds. Ecology This anemone is often seen crowded together in small gullies with strong wave action. It feeds on mussels, whelks, other molluscs, and urchins. It has an extremely strong contractile sphincter muscle which helps it grip and ingest passing food quickly before it is taken away by the waves. This anemone is larger and particularly abundant in areas where there is strong wave action that tears molluscs from the rocks, and it seems to rely on this turbulence to supply its prey. Sea anemones lack the free-swimming medusal stage of the lifecycle of the typical Cnidarian; the sandy anemone produces eggs and sperm, and the fertilized egg develops into a planula larva which drifts as part of the plankton before settling on the seabed and developing directly into a juvenile sea anemone.* References Category:Actiniidae Category:Animals described in 1857 ","title":"Sandy anemone"},{"id":"32019048","text":"Gottlieb Conrad Pfeffel, painting by Georg Friedrich Adolph Schoner, 1809 Pfeffel dictating to his daughter, image accompanying a text dedicated to Johann Georg Jacobi, 1800 Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel (28 June 1736 ‚Äì 1 May 1809) was a French-German writer and translator from the Pfeffel family. His texts were put to music by Ludwig van Beethoven, Joseph Haydn and Franz Schubert. He is sometimes also known as Am√©d√©e or Th√©ophile Conrad Pfeffel, which is the French translation of Gottlieb (\\"Godlove\\"). Biography Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel was born in Colmar. His father, Johann Konrad Pfeffel, was the mayor of Colmar and a legal consultant of the French king, but died when Gottlieb was only two years old. He was raised by his brother Christian Friedrich Pfeffel, who was ten years older. He went in 1751 to the University of Halle to study Law, with the intention of becoming a diplomat. There, he was a student of the philosopher Christian Wolff. In 1752, he translated Johann Joachim Spalding's Gedanken √ºber den Werth der Gef√ºhle in dem Christenthum in French. In 1754, he went to Dresden for treatment of an eye problem; there, he met the poet Christian F√ºrchtegott Gellert. His eye condition deteriorated, and in 1758, after an operation, he became completely blind and had to abandon his studies. In February 1759, he married Margaretha Cleophe Divoux, a merchant's daughter from Strasbourg. They had thirteen children together, of whom 7 died before adulthood. He started to establish himself as a writer and translator. In 1762, he translated Magnus Gottfried Lichtwer's Fabeln in French. He also worked on a translation into German of Claude Fleury's Histoire eccl√©siastique. He opened a military academy for aristocratic Protestants in 1773, since these boys were not allowed at the military academy of Paris. He joined the Helvetic Society in 1776, and in 1782 became a citizen of the city of Biel (Bienne) in Switzerland, and became an honorary member of the city council in 1783. The Prussian Academy of Arts made him an honorary member in 1788. After the French Revolution, he lost the military academy and his fortune, and found jobs with the educational board of Colmar, with the publisher T√ºbingen-Cotta, and as a translator, until Napoleon I granted him an annual pension in 1806. He wrote many articles for the magazine Flora. In 1808 he became an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities. He died the next year. His poem Der freie Mann was put to music by Ludwig van Beethoven (catalogue number WoO 117) in 1794 or 1795. Franz Schubert made a lied of his text Der Vaterm√∂rder (D10), and Leopold Kozeluch put music to his cantata for the blind Austrian singer Maria Theresia von Paradis. In 1773, his Philemon und Baucis: Ein Schauspiel in Versen von einem Aufzuge, a play in verse in one act, was turned into a Singspiel for a marionette theater by Joseph Haydn with the new title Philemon und Baucis oder Jupiters Reise auf die Erde (Philemon and Baucis or Jupiter's Travels to the Earth). It was changed into a regular opera in 1776. Pfeffel was a friend or acquaintance of many well-known persons of his period, including Voltaire, Vittorio Alfieri and the Swiss poet Johann Kaspar Lavater, which whom he corresponded for many years. In 1839, his niece Ernestine von Pfeffel (1810-94) married Fyodor Tyutchev, one of the most famous Russian poets. A statue of Pfeffel by Andr√© Friedrich was placed in the Unterlinden Museum in 1859, and a copy of that statue was placed on the Grand Rue in Colmar in 1927.

He is best known for his involvement in the Boxer Rebellion. Life Zaixun was born in the Aisin Gioro clan as the second son of Yiren (Â•ï‰ªÅ; 1824‚Äì1874), the ninth successor to the Prince Zhuang peerage, one of the 12 \\"iron-cap\\" princely peerages of the Qing dynasty. Born during the reign of the Xianfeng Emperor, Zaixun initially held the title of a fuguo gong. In 1875, during the reign of the Guangxu Emperor, he was promoted to qinwang (first-rank prince), and inherited the title \\"Prince Zhuang of the First Rank\\" (ËéäË¶™Áéã) from his father. In 1900, Zaixun strongly advocated making use of the Righteous and Harmonious Society (or \\"Boxers\\") to counter foreign aggression. The following year, after Empress Dowager Cixi issued the Imperial Decree of declaration of war against foreign powers, war broke out between the Qing Empire and Eight-Nation Alliance, leading to the Boxer Rebellion. Zaixun and Gangyi (ÂâõÊØÖ) were placed in command of Boxer groups to fight the foreigners. Zaixun had an altar set up in his residence, while he personally donned garments similar to those of the Boxers. Not long afterwards he was appointed as the Nine Gates Infantry Commander, and he gave out rewards for the capture and killing of foreigners. All the Boxers throughout China first gathered in Zaixun's residence after arriving in Beijing to receive their respective missions. When Beijing fell to the Eight- Nation Alliance in 1900, Empress Dowager Cixi fled to Xi'an in western China. She was accompanied by Zaixun, who took on the post of Camp Inspecting Minister (Êü•ÁáüÂ§ßËá£). 1,700 Boxers in Zaixun's residence were killed by foreign soldiers. During the negotiations for the Boxer Protocol, Zaixun was accused of being one of the masterminds of the Boxer Rebellion by the foreign powers. In 1901, he was impeached and stripped of his titles, and on February 21 he committed suicide by hanging himself in Puzhou (present-day Yongji, Shanxi).http://www.qingchao.net/lishi/yihetuan/ Â∞ÅÂª∫ËíôÊòß‰∏ª‰πâ‰∏é‰πâÂíåÂõ¢ËøêÂä®http://www.bjxch.gov.cn/pub/xch_wenziban/B/xcly/xcly_4/200812/t20081209_1131407.html Âπ≥ÂÆâÈáåÁöÑËØûÁîüÊó•Â∞±ÊòØËæâÁÖå‰∫ÜÂçÅ‰∏â‰ª£ÁöÑÂ∫ÑÁéãÂ∫úË¶ÜÁÅ≠Êó∂ Zaixun's residence previously belonged to Liu Jin, a court eunuch of the Ming dynasty.

It took the view that establishing the common-law employment status of an employment contract requires attention to a multiple list of factors. In some regards this judgement appears to undermine the three-step reasoning in Ready Mixed Concrete (South East) Ltd v Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (RMC), which was decided the previous year. However, 'Market Investigations' involved implying the companies best-practice handbook into each of the separate contracts between the parties, whereas 'RMC' was judged purely by rational construction of the agreed terms of a lengthy written contract, against the background of the written contract as a whole. Facts Mrs Anne Irving from time to time conducted market research questionnaires. There was a dispute between the business for whom she did the surveys, Market Investigations, and the Minister for Social Security; over whether National Insurance contributions should have been made on her behalf. This depended on whether she was an employee. Judgment The up-front ratio decidendi of the judgement was that Market Investigations (MI) were mistaken in their belief that they did not have a right of control over Mrs Irving. The 'Guide for Interviewers' which J Cooke implied into the terms of the contracts was a comprehensive prescription for how the work MUST be done. Therefore, MI had a clear right of control over Mrs Irvine, which meant that the contracts with her were contracts of service, and were subject to the National Insurance provisions for employed persons. The case did not create any precedent, but J Cooke included the following remark at the end of his brief review of the authorities. \\"The observations of Lord Wright, of Denning L.J. and of the Judges of the (US) Supreme Court suggest that the fundamental test to be applied is this: \\"Is the person who has engaged themselves to perform these services performing them as a person in business on their own account?\\" After establishing that the contracts which MI concluded with Mrs Irving were for personal service, and gave MI a decisive right of control over her, J Cooke looked to see whether the 'fundamental test' that he had adumbrated would strengthen or weaken the answer which consideration of the right of control had revealed. He found that there was nothing in the case which showed that the contracts were made with Mrs Irving, as a person in business on her own account, and therefore the decision based on control was sound. Interestingly, the first page summary of the case rearranged the order of J Cooke's actual reasoning. In doing so it obscured the importance of the 'right of control' to J Cooke's decision, giving prominence to the later review of whether Mrs Irving provided her services as a person in business on her own account. The Judgement runs from page 173 to page 188 of Vol 2 for the Queens Bench of that year.

Clarke. It was published in 1950 under the title \\"The Reversed Man\\" and appeared again in Clarke's collection of short stories Reach for Tomorrow, in 1956. Plot summary The first power plant to exploit superconductivity has been built, and worker Richard Nelson is \\"laterally inverted\\" following an accidental short-circuit in the facility. Nelson finds himself wearing his wedding ring on the wrong hand. Written texts appear mirror-inverted, and coins and his technical diary have been affected. Nelson begins to starve; normal food does not nourish him because most biological molecules are chiral. A chemist, Prof. Vandenburg, develops mirror-inverted parallels of nutrients required by Nelson. Ralph Hughes, the station's chief physicist, investigates the incident. He discovers that Nelson has traveled through a fourth spatial dimension. He dismisses the arguments of his curious secretary McPherson, who suspects that Albert Einstein had found this fourth dimension - time. The board of directors induce Nelson to partake in an experiment to \\"re-invert\\" him. Moreover, nobody is sure if they could continue to meet his unique dietary requirements. When recreating the short-circuit as closely as possible, a number of disquieting questions are raised regarding the technical parameters and specifications to meet. Subsequently, Nelson disappears during the second replicated short-circuit and, in a rush to supply power, a generator is brought in. It remains unclear what became of Nelson after his disappearance; his assistant remarked that there \\"didn't seem to be a person in the generator immediately after the accident\\". In the early hours of the morning, Hughes realises that the additional generator was placed exactly where Nelson disappeared. This leads him to believe that Nelson must have disappeared from time, but could re-materialize in the same spot as the running generator at any moment. He does not manage to contact the power station in time, and, in the distance, above the site of the station, a giant cloud of destruction is seen rising into the sky.

It was filmed from a single position at the Gorleston Pier end of the harbour, looking back towards Great Yarmouth itself. It was one of two films Birt Acres shot in Yarmouth. The second, which was premiered in 1897, has not survived, but depicted passengers being loaded onto (or unloaded from) a pleasure boat on the beach. Like other actuality films of the period, the film has no on-screen title, and the name by which the film is generally known is based on its content and references in contemporary sources. Release The \\"attractive Victorian film,\\" was according to Christian Hayes of BFI Screenonline, \\"one of the twenty-one subjects presented by Birt Acres to the royal family on 21st July 1896, the day before the marriage of Princess Maud to Prince Charles of Denmark, at one of the first royal film performances.\\" Legacy The film was long considered lost but footage discovered in the Henville collection in 1995 has been identified by the BFI as being from this film. This \\"decaying print,\\" according to Patrick Russell of the BFI, \\"was discovered and duplicated just in time for 1996's celebration of 100 years of projected film in Britain.\\" Hayes concludes that \\"the fragmentary nature of the film - the jarring cuts and the deterioration of the print - only serve to make it all the more intriguing.\\" References Category:British films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British silent short films Category:1890s documentary films Category:Black-and-white documentary films Category:Great Yarmouth Category:Films directed by Birt Acres Category:1890s rediscovered films Category:British documentary films Category:Rediscovered British films ","title":"Yarmouth Fishing Boats Leaving Harbour"},{"id":"32019181","text":"P Obul Reddy (died 30 June 2010) was an entrepreneur, industrialist, philanthropist and patron of the arts.

He also led Universidad de Las Palmas, Salamanca and Castell√≥n at that level. Playing career Amaral was born in Arico, on Tenerife in the Canary Islands. He spent his entire professional career with local CD Tenerife, apart from the 1985‚Äì86 season on loan to CD Bin√©far in Segunda Divisi√≥n B ‚Äì who were relegated. Over four seasons, Amaral amassed Segunda Divisi√≥n totals of 113 matches and 13 goals. He scored his first in the competition on 2 October 1983 in a 2‚Äì2 home draw against RC Celta de Vigo, after a blunder from the opposition's goalkeeper. Coaching career After managing several other clubs in the archipelago, Amaral was hired at Tenerife in January 2003, and resigned a year later with the team one point off the second-tier relegation zone. After a few months with rivals UD Las Palmas in the third level, he returned to the second with Tenerife briefly in 2006. Amaral took his first job outside his native islands in July 2006, with FC Cartagena. He left his position the following January, in protest at roles such as transfer business being assigned to Paco G√≥mez instead. In 2007‚Äì08, Amaral's SD Ponferradina won their group in the third division, but lost the play-off final 2‚Äì1 on aggregate to Alicante CF. He missed the first leg of that tie, having been sent off in the semi-final against M√©rida UD. In July 2008, he returned to the second tier with UD Salamanca, whom he led to ninth place in his only campaign. Amaral was appointed by CD Castell√≥n in the same league in June 2009. He was sacked on 13 October with the team in last place, having earned one point from seven games and lost the six others consecutively. In April 2011, Amaral returned to a Tenerife side seven points into the relegation zone with ten matches left in the second division. Despite having a year left on his contract, he was dismissed in June following their descent. Amaral returned to football in late September 2013, taking over an SD Huesca side in the zone of relegation to the Tercera Divisi√≥n. The following March, he was shown the door. In May 2019, Amaral ended a five-year hiatus by taking the place of Pier Luigi Cherubino at women's football team UD Granadilla Tenerife.

This is the largest kofun group in Japan, situated on a 70-meter hill composed of diluvium. Yamato Ouken and Miyazaki Expanding Yamato Ouken(red) around the 7th century;Miyazaki Prefecture is in eastern southern Kyushu There are various Japanese names for a political/governmental organization present starting in the third century of kofun period in Kinki area of Japan, composed of several powerful families, with ≈å (king) or ≈åkimi (great king) as its center. These names include Yamato Ch≈çtei (Court), Yamato ≈åken, Wa ≈åken, and Yamato Seiken. At the same time, there are views that the presence of smaller regional states should be respected. There is a view that Ch≈çtei (Court) should not be used before the 4th and 5th century. At the present time, Yamato ≈åken is tentatively used here. In the mythologies of country production, Miyazaki appeared as a part of Kumaso in Kyushu, but not as a unified force but it is considered to be a part of Kumaso-controlled area. By and by, the force of Yamato ≈åken infiltrated from the ≈åita area southward. According to Nihon Shoki, a Japanese document, the offspring of Prince Toyokuniwake, who followed Emperor Keik≈ç, became the top of Hy≈´ga, or agata-nushi, at Morokara. Hy≈´ga After the establishment of the Ritsury≈ç system, the country of Hy≈´ga had been called Himuka, facing the east. The control of Yamato ≈åken was not strong, and in 702, Satsuma country, and in 713, ≈åsumi country was separated, thus the country of Hy≈´ga was determined. These countries were under the strong control of Yamato ≈åken, or Dazaifu. In 815, there were 500 soldiers of the Yamato ≈åken, and comparison of soldiers revealed more lower class soldiers than in other countries. Kamakura period =Shimazu Tadahisa, the founder of the Shimazu Samurai clan= In 1185, Shimazu Tadahisa (died August 1, 1227) was the founder of the Shimazu samurai clan. The Shimazu clan had become the daimy≈ç of Satsuma and ≈åsumi domains of Kagoshima and Hyuga country. He went to Satsuma in 1196, subdued Hyuga and Osumi provinces, and built a castle in the domain of Shimazu (Hy≈´ga) which name he also adopted. He is buried in Kamakura, near his father's tomb. =Muromachi Period and Nanbokucho Period= Strongmen in Hyuga were Tsuchimochi, Ito, Kitahara and Shimazu, Hongo and Niiro. These strongmen fought against their enemies. Finally, Shimazu was most powerful, until the time of their defeat by Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1587. Then Hyuga was given to various daimy≈çs who fought for Hideyoshi. Miyazaki Encyclopedia (in Japanese) Miyazaki Nichinichi Shinbunsha 1983. Edo Period In the Edo period, Hyuga was divided into many hans; the greatest was the Satsuma han of Kagoshima which belonged to Shimazu clan. Other hans included Nobeoka han, Takanabe han, Sadowara han and Obi han. =Nobeoka Han= *In 1587, Takahashi Mototane was given this area (Nobeoka, Takachiho, Miyazaki, Honjo and Hokita) and built Agata (Nobeoka) Castle. 53,000 koku. Later, Arima Naozumi, Miura Akihiro and Makino Nario were given this area respectively but they did not govern this area continuously. In 1747, Naito Masaki was given this area and his family continued to the end of Edo period. 70,000 koku. =Takanabe Han= *In 1587, Akizuki Saburo was given this area. 30,000 koku. Takanabe han continued to the end of the han system. =Sadowara Han= *In 1577, Shimazu Iehisa entered Sadowara Castle, and the possession of his land was assured in 1588. In 1603, Shimazu Yukihisa entered the Sadowara Castle. 30,000 koku. The han continued to the termination of the han system. Sadowara town was composed of areas samurais lived and townspeople lived. Sadowara clay dolls were produced. =The It≈ç clan and Obi Han= The It≈ç-family were a Japanese clan that claimed descent from the medieval warrior It≈ç Suketoki. The family became a moderate power both in influence and ability by the latter Sengoku Period of Feudal Japan. The It≈ç family survived through the Muromachi Period, and remained a powerful clan well into the Sengoku period. The It≈ç family's most serious rivals in this period were the Shimazu. The Shimazu clan, which had unified Satsuma Province and ≈åsumi Province under their control, began to clash with the It≈ç in 1570. The It≈ç were finally defeated by the Shimazu in 1578. The family followed Toyotomi Hideyoshi's invasion of Kyushu and Itoh Suketake won the land of Obi, now Nichinan which became the Obi Domain. 23,000 koku which became 40,500 koku and a peak of 57,816 koku. Aya Castle 1331‚Äì1615, mountain castle, once one of the 48 castles of Ito clan =The Shimazu clan and Miyazaki= The Shimazu clan, the tozama daimyo, was a powerful clan and its territory spanned the provinces of Satsuma, Osumi and the south-west region of Hy≈´ga, and had the Ry≈´ky≈´ Kingdom as a vassal state. The territory is largely contiguous with today's Kagoshima prefecture, and parts of Miyazaki prefecture. Meiji Era Miyazaki Prefecture was placed, but it was made a part of Kagoshima Prefecture once. In 1883, Hyuga was separated from Kagoshima Prefecture, naming it Miyazaki Prefecture. A part of previously Hyuga remained in the Kagoshima Prefecture. =Peculiarities of the capital of Miyazaki Prefecture= *The area of Miyazaki City had been an exclave of Ito clan, Nobeoka han, Obi han, Kagoshima han, Takanabe han, Tenryo (shogunate governed) depending on the time and areas. Therefore, a deserted village of Kamibeppu Mura was chosen as the site of the prefectural building in 1873. It was very lonely, and it was said that badgers and foxes lived there. The name of the prefecture was from the Miyazaki gun of the village. *Almost all sites of the prefectural capital cities are the so-called castle towns. Miyazaki and Hokkaido are exceptions. *The development of Miyazaki Prefecture was very slow. People from other prefectures were invited to live there. Miyazaki Shrine and Hakko Ichiu Monument Miyazaki *Miyazaki-jing≈´ in which Emperor Jimmu was enshrined was established and enlarged in Miyazaki City. The Imperial house of Japan traditionally based its claim to the throne on its descent from Jimmu. No firm dates can be assigned to this early emperor's life or reign, nor for the reigns of his early successors. Most modern historians dismiss this entire period as being beyond what history can know. *Hakk≈ç ichiu (ÂÖ´Á¥ò‰∏ÄÂÆá, \\"eight cords, one roof\\" i.e. \\"all the world under one roof\\") was a Japanese political slogan that became popular from the Second Sino-Japanese War to World War II, and was popularized in a speech by Prime Minister of Japan Fumimaro Konoe on January 8, 1940.

It was founded in 1918 in Hy≈´ga, in the mountains of Miyazaki Prefecture in Ky≈´sh≈´. Work in the village and do creative work was their motto. In 1939 they were warned that much of their land was about to be submerged by the construction of a dam, so they searched for a new home and found 10 hectares in Moroyama-machi, Iruma-gun, Saitama Prefecture.

As Lord Clarke said,[2011] UKSC 41, [35] Facts Twenty car valeters, including Mr Paul Huntington and Mr Belcher, worked for Autoclenz Ltd in Measham, Derbyshire. Autoclenz Ltd had contracted with British Car Auctions Ltd (BCA) to provide valeting services. The valeters engaged by Autoclenz claimed holiday pay and pay at the rate of the national minimum wage. They had each signed contracts describing them as self-employed. Paul Huntington worked full-time from 1991 until the hearing before the Employment Tribunal (and thereafter) except for a few weeks working for a competitor in 2002 and 2003. In 2007 Autoclenz Ltd invited the valeters to sign new contracts, purportedly clarifying that they were sub-contractors and not employees, that they must provide their own cleaning materials, that there was no obligation to provide services to Autoclenz and nor did Autoclenz have any obligation to offer work to the valeters. Furthermore, there was a term that a valeter could provide a suitably qualified substitute. Autoclenz made a 5% charge for materials, and a charge for insurance. The individuals wore the BCA logo on uniforms for security reasons. Autoclenz contended that the individuals were not 'workers' for the purposes of the statutory definitions of that term in the Working Time Regulations 1999 and the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. Judgment =Employment Tribunal= At the Employment Tribunal, Employment Judge Foxwell held that the claimants were employees and that even if they were not, they were workers. Judge Peter Clark in the Employment Appeal Tribunal held that the claimants were not employees but that they were workers, following the decision of the Court of Appeal in Consistent Group Ltd v Kalwak. The company appealed against the finding that the individuals were workers, and the individuals then cross-appealed against the finding that they were not employees. =Court of Appeal= Smith LJ held that the car valeters were employees despite the contract describing them as self-employed. Employers and their advisers cannot draft their way out of employment status if that does not accord with the reality of the relationship: Aikens LJ concurred in the result, but said that he would put the point in his own words. Sedley LJ concurred with Aikens LJ. He said,[2008] EWCA Civ 1046, [103] =Supreme Court= Lord Hope, Lord Walker, Lord Collins, Lord Clarke and Lord Wilson, on appeal, unanimously held that the car valeters were engaged under contracts of employment and this was not affected by the clauses which stated that they were self-employed, had no obligation to work, no right to receive work, and could substitute another worker. Lord Clarke, giving the judgment of the court, emphasised that a contract of employment was a specific kind of contract, not to be treated the same as commercial contracts, because there may be an element of inequality of bargaining power. The judgment of Rimer LJ, in Consistent Group Ltd v Kalwak, suggesting that contractual documents contained the expression of the true intentions of the parties unless there was a sham, intended to deceive third parties, was expressly doubted. Accordingly, under the valeters were employees and 'workers' as defined and were entitled both to remuneration at the rate of the national minimum wage and to paid leave.

When Odisha became a state on 1 April 1936. Odisha Cabinet on 7 June 2020, Sunday accorded the poem the state anthem status. It was a long standing demand of people of the State to accord state song status to this poem which has been passed by the State cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik after the Odias across the globe had come together on the clarion of Chief Minister of Odisha Naveen Patnaik to sing Bande Utkala Janani on 5:30 pm of May 30 to boost the morale of frontline workers or COVID-19 warriors tackling the coronavirus outbreak. The poem envisages a Utkala who maintains her self-respect and dignity from a position of confidence and strength rather than insecurity and fear. This movement for a separate province also gathered momentum in Odisha. The Utkal Sammilani (a federation of Odias) was leading this movement. This influenced the poet Laxmikanta Mohapatra, who was then young and energetic. He started writing Bande Utkala Janani (Glory To The Mother Utkala!) and some other fiery songs with a patriotic motive. Well, known national poet of Odisha Banchhanidhi Mohanty was also a good singer. He used to sing Laxmikanta's patriotic songs throughout Odisha and inspired everyone. Once Rabindra Nath Tagore wrote in one of his essays i.e. \\"A Vision of India's History\\" that 'the history of India has been the history of a struggle between the mechanical spirit of conformity in social organization and the creative spirit of man which seeks freedom and love in self-expression' justifies Laxmikanta as a true patriotic poet. This song was first sung at the Utkal Sammilani's Conference at Balasore in 1912, This song was used as a weapon by the Utkal Sammilani to emancipate Odisha. In a meeting at Bhadrak, where the poet Mohapatra was felicitated, the then young leader of Odisha Harekrushna Mahtab admitted that the poet Laxmikanta's patriotic songs have inspired him a lot. In the past, outsiders like Mughals and Britishers ruled Odisha and its geographical boundaries changed from time to time accordingly. The State Government's decision to stand up to pay respect when the song is played has been praised. Therefore, it was made compulsory at the end of any Odisha Legislative Assembly Session and in the beginning of school prayer in State Govt. schools in Odisha during the 1990s.

The band's experiments with the sounds which would later be labelled as world and ambient music came parallel to that of Brian Eno, who described Floating World as an 'important album'.  History  After the end of the 1972 American tour, the band's Vertigo contract was cancelled and Jade Warrior dissolved. Steve Winwood then urged Chris Blackwell of Island Records to give the band a hearing, and the latter proposed that Jon Field and Tony Duhig reform the band and sign a contract for three albums (later expanded to four) \\"as an ornament\\" to the label. Since Blackwell was interested in a primarily instrumental sound, the contract offered by Island was not extended to include Glyn Havard. Floating World was the first of these four releases that Field and Duhig made with miscellaneous guest musicians. On some pieces ‚Äì particularly the more introspective (\\"Waterfall\\", \\"Rainflower\\" and \\"Memories of a Distant Sea\\"), multi-instrumentalists Duhig and Field provided all the instrumentation. On other tracks, such as \\"Easty\\", \\"Mountain of Fruit and Flowers\\" and \\"Red Lotus\\", guest musicians were brought in for the drums, string bass, harp, lead guitar and female voice (\\"Quba\\").  Style and concept  Floating World is a concept album structured around the Japanese philosophy of Ukiyo, the acceptance of life and its surroundings, living only for the moment (\\"..like a gourd floating along the river current..\\" to quote the album's liner notes). The sound of it has been described as \\"based on a unique combination of rock, jazz, classical and world influences, employing the extremities of dynamic range\\". AllMusic defines it as 'a complex set', noting that while \\"the compositions may be interlaced, ...the album itself is as diverse as any previous Jade offering\\". Among its high points, critics mentioned \\"Monkey Chant\\", a \\"collision of the ancient traditional Balinese Kecac pitted against David Duhig's screaming rock guitar solo\\" has been mentioned, the opening \\"Clouds\\", juxtaposing 'an ethereal girls choir, tinkling wind chimes, glowing ambient passages, and incendiary guitar licks' and more aggressive \\"Red Lotus\\". According to critic Jo-Ann Green, the \\"sheer diversity of sounds and moods, the constant clash or gentle intermingling of Eastern and Western styles, and the set's glittering atmospheres (make) Floating World an undeniable masterpiece\\".

ACT domains are linked to a wide range of metabolic enzymes that are regulated by amino acid concentration. The ACT domain is named after three of the proteins that contain it: aspartate kinase, chorismate mutase and TyrA. The archetypical ACT domain is the C-terminal regulatory domain of 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (3PGDH), which folds with a ferredoxin-like topology. A pair of ACT domains form an eight-stranded antiparallel sheet with two molecules of allosteric inhibitor serine bound in the interface. Biochemical exploration of a few other proteins containing ACT domains supports the suggestions that these domains contain the archetypical ACT structure. The ACT domain was discovered by Aravind and Koonin using iterative sequence searches.

The Council encouraged the inclusion of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support in its peacekeeping mandates. The adoption of Resolution 1983 marked the second time HIV/AIDS and the impact on international peace and security had been discussed by the Security Council. The resolution, tabled by Gabon, came ahead of a three-day high-level meeting concerning the international community's response to HIV/AIDS. Resolution =Observations= The Security Council was concerned that since the beginning of the HIV epidemic 30 years ago, more than 60 million people had been infected, 25 million had died and 16 million children were orphaned by AIDS. It recognised that the issue required an \\"exceptional and comprehensive global response\\" as it posed a threat to all societies. Council members emphasised the role of the General Assembly and Economic and Social Council in addressing HIV/AIDS. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) was praised for its response to HIV/AIDS in appropriate forums. The preamble of the resolution recognised the impact HIV/AIDS had in society, particularly in conflict and post-conflict situations through mass movements of people, sexual violence and limited access to medical care. The Council noted, therefore, that it was important to end conflict-related violence and empowering women to reduce their risk of exposure to HIV. There was also concern at the rise in health-related issues by United Nations personnel. Furthermore, the protection of civilians by United Nations peacekeeping operations could contribute towards fighting HIV/AIDS, and welcomed initiatives by countries to implement HIV treatment, care, prevention and support. =Acts= Council members emphasised that urgent action was needed to curb the impact of the HIV epidemic in conflict and post-conflict situations, through local, national, regional and international initiatives. The Council noted the \\"disproportionate burden\\" of HIV/AIDS on women that continued to affect gender equality and the empowerment of women and urged assistance in this context. The resolution recognised that United Nations peacekeeping operations were important factors in the response against HIV/AIDS, and welcomed its inclusion in its peacekeeping mandates, stressing support was needed to address the social stigma and discrimination associated with the disease. The Secretary- General was urged to consider a variety of HIV/AIDS-related issues in his activities concerning the prevention and resolution of conflict, and strengthen efforts to implement the zero-tolerance sexual exploitation policy. The Security Council encouraged the use of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support in its peacekeeping missions, such as through counselling, testing programmes and assistance provided to national institutions; such efforts needed to be intensified, according to the resolution. Finally, co-operation among states was welcomed and encouraged in the role of HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support.

The protagonist discovers a mysterious shop\\"The Shottle Bop\\", between Twentieth and Twenty-first Streets, on Tenth Avenue in New York Citywhich has bottles containing all manner of strange things. The proprietor dislikes his pompous attitude, paralyzes him by spraying him with the essential oil from the hair of a Gorgon's head, and only releases him after extracting a grudging apology.

His only album, on which he was credited as Mij (\\"Jim\\" spelled backwards), was released by ESP Records in 1969, and has been described as \\"one of the best and strangest cosmic folk records of the 1960s\\".Richard Morton Jack, \\"Altered States: Strange Folk - USA Part II\\", Record Collector magazine, May 2011, p. 28 Holmberg grew up on a farm near Salt Lake City, Utah, and attended military school in California. He was a keen football player and claimed to have had an out of body experience during one game. He started singing and playing guitar while in the US Navy, and after leaving became an itinerant folk singer. In the mid-1960s he had a motorcycle crash in Lancaster, California, which left him with a fractured skull and near-fatal spinal meningitis, after which he discovered a new falsetto singing range. In 1968, he was singing in Washington Square Park, New York City, when he was heard one day by Bernard Stollman, the head of ESP-Disk. Stollman offered to record Holmberg, and his semi-improvised solo album was recorded in three hours on 12 January 1969, with recording engineer Onno Scholtze. ESP Disk official site The front sleeve of the album showed an outline portrait drawing of Holmberg, with the instruction Color by the Number, the title by which the album is sometimes known although in more recent years it has often been promoted as The Yodeling Astrologer, despite Holmberg's protestations that he was never an astrologer and does not yodel. Interview with Holmberg by Liz Armstrong, Vice magazine, 2009 Eventually released in September 1969, the record was not commercially successful, and Holmberg disappeared from view for several decades.

He served as Governor of Barbados from 1689 to 1693. Early life Kendall was baptized on 17 June 1647, the fourth, but third surviving son of Thomas Kendall of Lostwithiel, Cornwall and his wife Elizabeth Arscott, daughter of Arthur Arscott of Tetcott, Devon. He was admitted at Middle Temple and Lincoln's Inn on 28 December 1666. He joined the army and was a cornet in the Royal Horse Guards in 1675. From 1678 to 1679 he was a lieutenant colonel in Lord Morpeth's regiment of foot and from 1680 to 1687 a captain in the Coldstream Guards. Career Kendall was returned as Tory Member of Parliament for West Looe at the 1685 English general election. He was appointed Governor of Barbados in 1689 until 1693, and a member of the Council from 1694 to 1695. He returned to England and was returned as MP for West Looe again at the 1695 English general election on the interest of his niece Mary Kendall. From 1696 to 1699, he was a Lord of the Admiralty. He was returned again at the 1698 English general election and at the two general elections of 1701, but when he fell out with his niece, he was dropped at the 1702 English general election. He thereupon disinherited her. At the 1705 English general election, Kendall stood in a contest at Lostwithiel on the interest of his relative Canon Nicholas Kendall. He was defeated in the poll, but petitioned and was seated as MP for Lostwithiel on 17 January 1706. By this time he was listed as a Whig. He was returned for Lostwithiel at the 1708 British general election. Death and legacy Kendall died of apoplexy at Carshalton on 10 July 1708 and was buried in south choir aisle of Westminster Abbey on 16 July.

Born in 1962, she studied mass communication at the UVA in Amsterdam and earned an MA International Journalism at City University in London. She worked in magazine journalism until 2000 while writing her first book Jagtlust, about a ramshackle villa that was a meeting place for many artists and poets in the 1960s. Annejet van der Zijl lives in Amsterdam with her husband, a journalist. Books Jagtlust (1998) was the debut novel about a villa where young artists gathered and rejected the established society of the 1950s. Jagtlust was followed by Anna (2002), the widely praised biography of the legendary Dutch children's writer Annie M.G. Schmidt. 'The book was nominated for several awards. This book was adapted into a TV mini-series called Annie M.G., directed by Dana Nechushtan. 2004 saw the appearance of Sonny Boy, a reconstruction of the forbidden love between a Surinamese student and a married Dutch woman against the backdrop of the 1930s and the Second World War. Based on a true story, the book became immensely popular, selling over half a million copies in the Netherlands alone. Also, it was published in six other countries. The film version, which was directed by Dutch filmmaker Maria Peters and premiered in January 2011, was the opening film of the Stony Brook Film Festival in New York in July 2011. Van der Zijl's fourth book, Bernhard ‚Äì a hidden history, appeared in March 2010. With this detailed reconstruction of the unknown early life of Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld, the German- born husband of queen Juliana, she obtained a doctorate in History at the University of Amsterdam. Like its predecessors, this book was nominated for several historical and literary awards. In March 2011, Bernhard was given the M.J. Brusse Award for Best Journalism of 2011. The thesis on which the book was based earned her a doctorate in history at the University of Amsterdam. In 2014 Van der Zijl published Gerard Heineken, a biography of Gerard Heineken, the little-known founder of the Heineken brewery and brand. Her latest book traces the life story of Allene Tew, an American socialite during the Gilded Age who made her way into European aristocracy in the 1930s. De Amerikaanse prinses ('The American Princess') was published in November 2015. The book was highly praised and became a huge bestseller in The Netherlands, topping the Dutch bestseller list for multiple weeks.http://www.debestseller60.nl/ An English translation by Michele Hutchison, An American Princess: The Many Lives of Allene Tew, followed in 2017.

The decision of the European Court of Justice concerned the scope of protection for people with regard to employment rights. The Court took the view that an employment contract requires someone to work under the direction of another. Facts Deborah Lawrie-Blum was a British national who had passed the first stage of teacher training whilst studying at the University of Freiburg. She was refused entry to the second stage of training by the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg because teachers in Germany are regarded as civil servants. Federal law stated that such posts could only be held by German citizens. Lawrie-Blum took the case to the Landgericht (State Court) of Stuttgart on the grounds that she was a worker and therefore entitled to obtain employment in any EEC state. The Landesgericht held that a trainee teacher was not a ‚Äòworker‚Äô within the terms of Article 48(1) of the Treaty of the European Economic Community, and even if it was, a public servant exemption in Article 48(4) applied. Lawrie-Blum then appealed to the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) which requested a ruling from the European Court of Justice (ECJ). Judgment The ECJ stated that the concept of ‚Äòworker‚Äô in Article 48 should be interpreted broadly as (I) a person (II) performing services (III) under the direction of another (IV) for remuneration, and that included a trainee teacher.

The case was heard on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Hong Kong. Facts A skilled stone mason wanted to claim he was within the health and safety regulations. To do so, he would have to be regarded in law as an employee. Advice Mr Lee Ting Sang was regarded as an employee. Therefore, he could claim that he was within the health and safety regulations. This was in spite of the fact that he was not, due to the skills he possessed, instructed how to do the job. The court took into account that he (1) worked mainly for a subcontractor on short-term basis, (2) was paid a piece-work rate or a daily rate, (3) did not possess any equipment, (4) did not hire any helpers, and (5) was not required to exercise management of the job, Significance The Privy Council took into account a number of factors to determine if there was a legal relationship of employment. They held that this was indeed the case, despite the fact that the worker here was skilled. Traditionally, skill was a factor which negated the existence of a legal relationship of employment.

The show aired on Fridays at 10:00 pm ET. The season consisted of 13 episodes. The show starred Emily Rose, Lucas Bryant, Eric Balfour and Nicholas Campbell. Storylines =Audrey Parker= In the beginning of season one, Audrey is dispatched to Haven, Maine, to investigate the death of an escaped federal prisoner named Jonas Lester, a former Haven resident. On her first day in town, she nearly runs her Ford Taurus off a cliff, but is rescued by Detective Nathan Wuornos, who ends up assisting in her investigation. She meets Havenites Conrad Brauer and Duke Crocker, as well as journalists Vince and Dave Teagues, before discovering that Lester was thrown to his death by a local woman named Marion Caldwell. Incredibly, Audrey finds that Marion killed the man using her paranormal abilities. The Teagues show Audrey an old newspaper clipping with a photo of a young boy, as well as a woman who strongly resembles Audrey herself. Her curiosity is awakened and, after solving the Lester case, Parker chooses to stay in Maine, using several weeks of her accrued vacation time. She questions Haven Police Chief Garland Wuornos (Nathan's father) about the woman in the picture. The photo is related to a 1983 case involving the \\"Colorado Kid,\\" and Wuornos was an investigator. The chief agrees to look into the matter and finds the old evidence box. They open the sealed box, but discover that it's empty. After solving the bizarre destruction of a bar called the Rust Bucket with Nathan, Audrey is offered a position with the Haven Police Department by Chief Wuornos, who cites Parker's willingness to \\"see things as they are\\" as a valuable trait. At the end of season one, Parker's supervisor, Agent Howard, demands that she give him a reason for her continued presence in Haven. Audrey explains that she has to pursue a personal search for her past and her identity, so she quits her job with the FBI on the spot. =Nathan Wuornos= In the beginning of season one, Nathan rescues FBI Agent Audrey Parker when her vehicle runs off the road and crashes through a barrier. He subsequently investigates the death of Jonas Lester with her, and is later shot through the shoulder while arresting a man named Ted Ford. Strangely, Nathan doesn't seem to react to being shot. He also investigates the bizarre destruction of a ship called the Rust Bucket with Parker. Another case involves the bizarre behavior of doctors and patients at the Murray Q. Frederickson Psychiatric Facility, when Nathan suffers a psychotic episode after falling victim to Ray McBreen's metaphysical power. Other cases include the inexplicable putrefaction of food surrounding Bill and Jeff McShaw at the Second Chance Bistro, the rapid-aging deaths of Phil Reiser and Joe Campbell, the mauling deaths of T. R. Holt and Brad Donnelly, the baffling attack on Eliot Wallace aboard the ship Endorfin and the death of Joe Sandimaro, as well as the deaths of Hessberg nurses Bill Rand and Mrs. Wilson. Nathan pursues a relationship with animal-rights activist Jess Minnion, though he experiences anxiety over being intimate with her because, as we find out, he can't feel physical sensation. The relationship ends after Minnion is attacked and nearly killed during one of Nathan's investigations (involving the Dark Man). Jess decides to return to Montreal, unable to cope with being drawn into the dangers inherent in Wuornos's line of work. After she leaves, Nathan discovers that he is able to feel the touch of Audrey Parker, and though he keeps the discovery to himself, he begins to find excuses to be in physical contact with her. Nathan attends a surprise birthday party for Parker at a hotel on a nearby island called Carpenter's Knot. A sudden storm hits and the lights go out. While trying to restore power, the guests find the hotel owner lying dead in a shapeless heap. Chief Wuornos, Nathan's father and one of the guests, explains the strange circumstances, saying that a shape-shifter must have been posing as the hotel owner for years. The \\"chameleon\\" has killed one of the guests during the blackout to assume a new identity. The elder Wuornos forbids anyone to leave the island until they discover the murderer, but then, his son falls under suspicion. Nathan has to act quickly to clear himself: he seizes Audrey, kisses her and then shoots her because he can't feel her touch and he knows that the chameleon has taken Parker's form. The chameleon, while dying, confesses to Nathan that Audrey is different and Nathan realizes that his partner is still alive. Fortunately, the guests find Parker and revive her. Nathan however, is very much aware that, in shooting Audrey, he has mirrored an action that his father took in May 1983. In the season's final episode, Max Hanson, who once lived in Haven, is paroled from Shawshank State Prison and returns to the town. Nathan then discovers that he is adopted and that the man is really his father. He also learns that his adoptive father, Chief Wuornos, has been struggling for decades to psychically hold the town of Haven together. When Garland's control over the town begins to fail, he is killed in one final effort to save Haven. Nathan is initially angry at Audrey for not offering the older man comfort, but he later apologizes and reveals he can feel her touch. Nathan is there when another \\"Audrey Parker\\" arrives at the close of the episode. =Duke Crocker= At the beginning of season one, Duke appears at the Haven, Maine police station to report a stolen revolver. Later, Crocker rescues FBI Agent Audrey Parker from drowning on her second day in town. He washes her clothes while she sleeps and makes her coffee the next morning ‚Äì with milk and one sugar, exactly the way she likes it ‚Äì even though Audrey has never seen the young man before. After Duke is arrested when his \\"stolen\\" gun turns up on Tuwiuwok Bluff, at the scene of Jonus Lester's mysterious death, Audrey clears him of suspicion in the case. Duke later acquires a stuffed marlin that once hung on the wall of the Shiny Scupper Restaurant and inadvertently buys the deed to the Second Chance Bistro from Bill McShaw for $20. Duke turns the place into the Grey Gull - a new bar/restaurant. In a later episode, he attends a surprise birthday party for Parker, and gives her a locket with the initials L.R. on the back. He admits that Lucy Ripley gave him the locket and that the old newspaper photo of Lucy (who uncannily resembles Audrey) also includes himself as a little boy. =Garland Wuornos= In the beginning of season one, Haven's Chief of Police, Garland Wuornos, grudgingly allows FBI Agent Audrey Parker access to the investigation of Jonas Lester's death, despite claiming that the man's greatest contribution to the town of Haven is dying. Lester is an escaped federal prisoner, so Parker is determined to figure out what happened to him and after the successful conclusion of the Lester case, Wuornos agrees to let Agent Parker look into the evidence container pertaining to the Colorado Kid murder. The two discover that the container (still closed with its original seal) is in fact, empty. Wuornos subsequently offers Agent Parker a job with the Haven Police Department, citing her willingness to \\"see things the way they are\\" as a valuable asset to his department. He is a member of the Haven Hunt Club, and is leading a hunt through the woods surrounding Haven when two members of the Club are attacked and killed by what appear to be wild animals. Later, Wuornos is among the guests attending a surprise birthday party for Parker on a local island called Carpenter's Knot when he must explain the nature of chameleons after one of them attacks a party guest. He later helps his son, Detective Nathan Wuornos, track Duke Crocker's boat, the Cape Rouge, when it is hijacked with Audrey on-board. At the end of season one, he encounters the newly-paroled Max Hansen, and in his anger, fails to hold up the Walton Lighthouse, which collapses. It turns out that Garland has literally been keeping the town of Haven together for years using psychic energy. Fearing that Nathan will soon discover that he has a past connection to Hansen, Garland admits to Nathan that the young man is adopted and is really Hansen's son. An argument follows and Garland believes that he has created an irreparable rift between himself and Nathan. In his anger over the argument, Garland fails to prevent a fissure from cracking a street as Hansen tries to escape, resulting in the parolee's death. As the elder Wuornos realizes that his control of the town is faltering, he goes out to Edgewater Beach, where he is later discovered by Audrey and Nathan. He struggles to regain control as fresh cracks open on the beach, and ultimately manages to heal the fissures by absorbing them into himself. Garland turns to stone and is shattered as a result. His remains are seen moving slightly after being collected.

(Socialists at the Crossroads: The Habsburg, Masaryk, or ≈†meral? 1968, extended edition in 1996), ƒåesk√© zemƒõ v √©≈ôe Prvn√≠ republiky (1918‚Äì1938), I‚ÄìIII (Bohemia in the First Republic Era (1918-1938), ed. 2000-2003), Mal√© dƒõjiny ƒçeskoslovensk√© (1867‚Äì1939) (Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867‚Äì1039), 2007). Professor K√°rn√≠k's professional creed was: ‚ÄúFind the cause of the phenomenon regardless of others‚Äô and your own previous conviction or opinion.‚Äù In his inaugural dissertation, Prvn√≠ pokusy o zalo≈æen√≠ komunistick√© strany v ƒåech√°ch (Initial Attempts at Founding a Communist Party in Bohemia), he focused on radical leftist groupings, primarily anarchists and anarchist-communists. His chef d‚Äôoeuvre about ‚Äòsocialists at the crossroads‚Äô focuses in detail on the developments in the social democrats‚Äô policies in Bohemia during the First World War in the Czech, Austrian-Hungarian, and international political context. The extensive trilogy on the First Republic brings a multifaceted analysis and description of the political, economic, demographic, social, and cultural and scientific development between the two world wars. The book is illustrated with images and tables, and the third tome analyses in detail the tragic period of the way to Munich Agreement. The work also takes into consideration the developments in Slovakia and Carpathian Ruthenia. His subsequent (and again extensive) work with a modest title of Small History of Czechoslovakia (1867‚Äì1939) approaches the topic from new positions. The timeline in itself is of principal importance, suggesting that the author examined both the prelude to the rise of the first Czechoslovak state towards the close of the Habsburg monarchy and its epilogue ‚Äì the Second Republic. The delivery tends towards the non-fiction fiction genre, in places focusing even more on the topics brought up by the ‚Äòtrilogy‚Äô, with more attention focused on Slovakia. Compared with the ‚Äòtrilogy‚Äô, the illustrations are much more extensive and illustration captions have the form of extensive explanations. K√°rn√≠k's editorial work is also of importance: Karel Kazbunda, Ot√°zka ƒçesko-nƒõmeck√° v p≈ôedveƒçer Velk√© v√°lky (Czech-German Question at the Dawn of the Great War, 1995), Bol≈°evismus, komunismus a radik√°ln√≠ socialismus v ƒåeskoslovensku, I‚ÄìV (Bolshevism, Communism, and Radical Socialism in Czechoslovakia, 2003‚Äì2005), K novovƒõk√Ωm soci√°ln√≠m dƒõjin√°m ƒçesk√Ωch zem√≠, I‚ÄìIV (On the Modern Times History of Bohemia, 1998‚Äì2001), etc. He also wrote a number of articles, essays, and 2 children's books about a group of boys set in the vicinity of Castle Hand≈°tejn during World War II. Zdenƒõk K√°rn√≠k has also contributed to the periodicals Pam√°tk√°≈ôsk√© pr√°ce (Heritage Works), Acta Oeconomica Pragensia, Historick√Ω obzor (Historical Horizon), V√Ωchodoƒçesk√© listy historick√© (Eastern Bohemian Historical Letters), Acta historica et museologica Universitatis Silesianae Opaviensis et al., to the Larousse encyclopaedia, and a number of collections and publications focusing on heritage preservation.

Almost 600 species are known today, which are found mainly in the tropics and subtropics. Some occur in temperate regions, but the subfamily is apparently completely absent from Europe, at least as native species. A few Epipaschiinae are crop pests that may occasionally become economically significant. Description and ecology Adult females are often hard to distinguish from related lineages, and even the larvae do not possess the characteristic sclerotized bristle base near the start of the abdomen, whose position is a tell-tale mark of the other subfamilies of Pyralidae. By contrast, the adult males of Epipaschiinae are easier to recognize, and three of their traits support the assumption that Epipaschiinae are a natural, monophyletic group: # an always upturned and pointed third segment of the labial palpi # a ventrally curved phallobase of the male which usually extends beyond the ductus ejaculatorius # the weakly sclerotized tegumen In addition, in most cases the adult males of this subfamily have a conspicuous scaled projection from the scape of the antennae. The caterpillar larvae are leaf rollers, leaf tiers and leaf miners. As pests, they infest such diverse plants as Persea americana (avocado), Swietenia (mahoganies), or Zea mays (corn). However, they are usually a mere nuisance and do not cause large-scale crop failure. Systematics Solis provided a phylogenetic analysis of 20 genera of the Pococera complex (consisting of some 300 species in the Western Hemisphere) in 1993, representing the first cladistic analysis of a pyraloid group. *Accinctapubes Solis, 1993 *Agastophanes Turner, 1937 *Anaeglis Lederer, 1863 *Anarnatula Dyar, 1918 *Anexophana Viette, 1960 *Apocera Schaus, 1912 (= Paranatula Dyar, 1913) *Araeopaschia Hampson, 1906 (= Aroeopaschia Amsel, 1956) *Astrapometis Meyrick, 1884 *Austropaschia Hampson, 1916 *Axiocrita Turner, 1913 *Bibasilaris Solis, 1993 *Cacozelia Grote, 1878 *Calybitia Schaus, 1922 *Canipsa Walker, 1866 (= Sarama Moore, 1888, Scopocera Moore, 1888) *Carthara Walker, 1865 (= Leptosphetta Butler, 1878, Pycnulia Zeller, 1881) *Catalaodes Viette, 1953 *Catamola Meyrick, 1884 (= Elaphernis Meyrick, 1936) *Cecidipta Berg, 1877 (= Acecidipta Amsel, 1956) *Chloropaschia Hampson, 1906 *Coenodomus Walsingham, 1888 (= Alippa Aurivillius, 1894, Dyaria Neumoegen, 1893) *Dasyvesica Solis, 1991 *Deuterollyta Lederer, 1863 (= Ajacania Schaus, 1925, Ajocara Schaus, 1925, Oedomia Dognin, 1906, Winona Hulst, 1888) *Doddiana Turner, 1902 *Elisabethinia Ghesqui√®re, 1942 *Ephedrophila Dumont, 1928 *Epilepia Janse, 1931 *Epipaschia Clemens, 1860 *Eublemmodes Gaede, 1917 *Geropaschia Hampson, 1917 (= Araeopaschia Hampson, 1916) *Glossopaschia Dyar, 1914 *Heminomistis Meyrick, 1933 *Homura Lederer, 1863 *Incarcha Dyar, 1910 *Isolopha Hampson, 1895 (= Islopha Janse, 1931) *Jocara Walker, 1863 *Lacalma Janse, 1931 *Lameerea Ghesqui√®re, 1942 *Lamida Walker, 1859 (= Allata Walker, 1863) *Lepidogma Meyrick, 1890 (= Asopina Christoph, 1893, Precopia Ragonot, 1891) *Lepipaschia J.

History The idea of an agricultural reporters' organisation was first mooted by Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, Minister of Agriculture from 1939-40. He approached Richard Haddon, managing editor of the Farmer and Stockbreeder magazine and senior voluntary press adviser to the Ministry of Agriculture, who in turn sought the backing of NFU Secretary Sir Cleveland Fyfe. Between 1941 and 1943, Haddon gathered a nucleus of senior journalists and was elected the Guild's first chairman in 1944. Founder members included: * Kenneth Pipe (first Honorary Treasurer; Chairman 1948-9; President 1967-8) * Percy Izzard * Anthony Hurd (agricultural correspondent of The Times, father of Douglas Hurd) * Sidney Maycock (editor of The Smallholder, then selling some 250,000 copies weekly) * Laurence Easterbrook (agricultural correspondent of the News Chronicle) * William Adair (editor of Scotland's Farming News) * Jock Robertson Coupar (agricultural correspondent for the Press Association) * Wilfrid Hill (public relations officer for the Milk Marketing Board, and seconded to the Minister during the war emergency) In his history of the Guild,The Guild of Agricultural Journalists: A History 1944-1987, Peter Bell MBE FGAJ Peter Bell reports that the early constitution of the Guild was lifted en bloc from another organisation and set out only the bread-and-butter running of the Guild. It was not until much later - 1959 - that the aims and objects familiar to today's members became part of the constitution. Despite Dorman-Smith's backing, Haddon did not wish the Guild to become a convenience for the Minister and the early members fashioned it in the form of a 'brotherhood'; the social side was important from the start. Initially, membership was open to agricultural journalists who gained three-quarters of their income from their writing. Annual subscription amounted to one guinea; half that for probationers. The earliest recorded meetings took place at the Milk Board's offices, presumably because of Wilfrid Hill's connections, but the venue soon switched to the Farmers Club in Whitehall Court, which has become the de facto London base of the Guild. By July 1948, membership had reached more than 100. Although the Guild started life as the GAJ of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the last three words were dropped after the Irish Republic formed a Guild to which the Northern Ireland members linked in 1962-3. In 2012, the name was further simplified to the British Guild of Agricultural Journalists.  Aims and Objectives  # To promote the highest professional standard among journalists, communicators, photographers and others who specialise in communications in agriculture, horticulture, rural affairs and related subjects # To represent members' interests and maintain relations with appropriate representative bodies # To provide a forum, through business meetings and social activities for members to meet eminent people in these industries # To maintain contact with similar associations overseas # To promote schemes for the continuing professional development of members of the Guild and for the provision and training of suitable entrants into agricultural and related journalism # To contribute towards a better understanding of agriculture's social, economic and environmental importance  Membership  Membership is open to anyone who earns their livelihood wholly or mainly through journalism or communication in the agricultural, horticultural and related industries. A 'Friend' category exists for those who do not meet the full membership criteria, but who nevertheless support the aims and objectives of the Guild, and who can make a contribution to its well- being and/or members.  Events  The Guild hosts a number of events each year. Chief amongst these is the annual Harvest Service held in St Brides' Church on Fleet Street, followed by luncheon. Others include receptions at the Cereals Event, LAMMA and the Royal Highland Show. The Guild hosted a reception at the Royal Welsh Show for the first time in 2012.  Awards  Several awards are run by the Guild, often supported by sponsors. While some are restricted only to members, others are open to all.

A metaplectic structure on a symplectic manifold allows one to define the symplectic spinor bundle, which is the Hilbert space bundle associated to the metaplectic structure via the metaplectic representation, giving rise to the notion of a symplectic spinor field in differential geometry. Symplectic spin structures have wide applications to mathematical physics, in particular to quantum field theory where they are an essential ingredient in establishing the idea that symplectic spin geometry and symplectic Dirac operators may give valuable tools in symplectic geometry and symplectic topology. They are also of purely mathematical interest in differential geometry, algebraic topology, and K theory. They form the foundation for symplectic spin geometry.  Formal definition  A metaplectic structure page 35 on a symplectic manifold (M, \\\\omega) is an equivariant lift of the symplectic frame bundle \\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\to M\\\\, with respect to the double covering \\\\rho\\\\colon {\\\\mathrm {Mp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R})\\\\to {\\\\mathrm {Sp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R}).\\\\, In other words, a pair ({\\\\mathbf P},F_{\\\\mathbf P}) is a metaplectic structure on the principal bundle \\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\to M\\\\, when :a) \\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\to M\\\\, is a principal {\\\\mathrm {Mp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R})-bundle over M, :b) F_{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\to {\\\\mathbf R}\\\\, is an equivariant 2-fold covering map such that :\\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\circ F_{\\\\mathbf P}=\\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf P} and F_{\\\\mathbf P}({\\\\mathbf p}q)=F_{\\\\mathbf P}({\\\\mathbf p})\\\\rho(q) for all {\\\\mathbf p}\\\\in {\\\\mathbf P} and q\\\\in {\\\\mathrm {Mp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R}). The principal bundle \\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf P}\\\\to M\\\\, is also called the bundle of metaplectic frames over M. Two metaplectic structures ({\\\\mathbf P_1},F_{\\\\mathbf P_1}) and ({\\\\mathbf P_2},F_{\\\\mathbf P_2}) on the same symplectic manifold (M, \\\\omega) are called equivalent if there exists a {\\\\mathrm {Mp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R})-equivariant map f\\\\colon {\\\\mathbf P_1}\\\\to {\\\\mathbf P_2} such that :F_{\\\\mathbf P_2}\\\\circ f=F_{\\\\mathbf P_1} and f({\\\\mathbf p}q)=f({\\\\mathbf p})q for all {\\\\mathbf p}\\\\in {\\\\mathbf P_1} and q\\\\in {\\\\mathrm {Mp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R}). Of course, in this case F_{\\\\mathbf P_1} and F_{\\\\mathbf P_2} are two equivalent double coverings of the symplectic frame {\\\\mathrm {Sp}}(n,{\\\\mathbb R})-bundle \\\\pi_{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\colon{\\\\mathbf R}\\\\to M\\\\, of the given symplectic manifold (M, \\\\omega). = Obstruction = Since every symplectic manifold M is necessarily of even dimension and orientable, one can prove that the topological obstruction to the existence of metaplectic structures is precisely the same as in Riemannian spin geometry. In other words, a symplectic manifold (M, \\\\omega) admits a metaplectic structures if and only if the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M)\\\\in H^2(M,{\\\\mathbb Z_2}) of M vanishes. In fact, the modulo _2 reduction of the first Chern class c_1(M)\\\\in H^2(M,{\\\\mathbb Z}) is the second Stiefel-Whitney class w_2(M). Hence, (M, \\\\omega) admits metaplectic structures if and only if c_1(M) is even, i.e., if and only if w_2(M) is zero. If this is the case, the isomorphy classes of metaplectic structures on (M, \\\\omega) are classified by the first cohomology group H^1(M,{\\\\mathbb Z_2}) of M with {\\\\mathbb Z_2}-coefficients. As the manifold M is assumed to be oriented, the first Stiefel-Whitney class w_1(M)\\\\in H^1(M,{\\\\mathbb Z_2}) of M vanishes too.

Hexon coat proteins are synthesised during late infection and form homo-trimers. The 240 copies of the hexon trimer that are produced are organised so that 12 lie on each of the 20 facets. The central 9 hexons in a facet are cemented together by 12 copies of polypeptide IX. The penton complex, formed by the peripentonal hexons and penton base (holding in place a fibre), lie at each of the 12 vertices. The hexon coat protein is a duplication consisting of two domains with a similar fold packed together like the nucleoplasmin subunits. Within a hexon trimer, the domains are arranged around a pseudo 6-fold axis. The domains have a beta-sandwich structure consisting of 8 strands in two sheets with a jelly-roll topology; each domain is heavily decorated with many insertions. Some hexon proteins contain a distinct C-terminal domain. Hexon directly recruits the cellular motor protein dynein in a pH-dependent manner. The dynein-regulatory protein, dynactin, was found to play a clear role in regulating the dynein-adenovirus complex transport to the nucleus.

They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins. Background  Dacians regions cf. Strabo (ca. 20 AD) by Muller (1877) Dacian gold bowl found in Transylvania (Vienna Museum) The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the Balkans to the northern Carpathians and from the Black Sea and the river Tyras to the Tisa plain, sometimes even to the Middle Danube. Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian- Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors. Dacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD). In the Bronze Age, proto- Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local Eneolithic (Chalcolithic) stock with the intruders of the transitional Indo- Europeanization Period. From these proto-Thracians, in the Iron Age, there were developed the Dacians of the Danubian-Carpathian Area on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern Balkan Peninsula on the other. Pre-Dacian periods North Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age. The local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared. Thracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions. While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East. Classical Dacian periods The 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto- Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube. The design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.

It is not known when Wright painted the picture, but it was first exhibited in 1769 in London with the Society of Artists. This was one of the earliest of many lamplight or candlelight paintings and portraits for which Wright is famed.  Description  This picture was described in the catalogue of the 1801 sale as a companion to The Alchemist Discovering Phosphorus. Each has a main figure in the foreground with two subsidiary ones behind, both are night scenes and show old men engaged in scientific research. The painting shows an old man who is thought to be a philosopher or a pilgrim, examining a collection of human bones in a lamp-lit cave. Two smaller men, or boys, dressed as pilgrims (as identified by the scallop shells in their hats: the emblem of St James) seem to be approaching him. The size of these figures is a lot smaller than the main character in the painting. Outside the cave the dark landscape is lit by the moonlight breaking through the clouds. Shells were the sign of pilgrims but they were also the emblem of the Darwin family which included Erasmus Darwin who was a leading member of the Lunar Society and Derby Philosophical Society which linked key men in the age of enlightenment. Democritus in Meditation by Salvator Rosa. Experts believe that this painting was based on Salvator Rosa's Democritus in Meditation. Wright‚Äôs friend John Hamilton Mortimer was a follower of Rosa‚Äôs so it is possible that Wright would have seen Rosa's work or an engraving of it. Democritus was a Greek philosopher who is remembered for making fun of the foolishness of mankind. Though the painting's subtitle is A Hermit Studying Anatomy, his attitude towards the bones he is holding does not suggest particularly serious scrutiny. He is surrounded by symbols of the ephemeral nature of the human condition which include the skeleton, a lamp that will burn all its fuel, the moon which has to be reborn every four weeks and an hour glass. The moon was also the symbol of the Lunar Society which Wright was strongly associated with although he never became a member. The preoccupation of the philosopher and trepidation of the two pilgrims may be a reflection on concerns about the new scientific understanding and enlightenment at the time Wright lived.

It was written in 1917 under the working title of \\"Bridge and the Oskaloosa Kid\\", and is a partial sequel to The Mucker (1914/1916). It was adapted into a silent film in 1919 starring Evelyn Greeley. Bridge, the protagonist, was a secondary character in the earlier work. It was first published in Blue Book Magazine in March 1918. Its first book publication paired it with an unrelated tale, \\"The Rider\\", in The Oakdale Affair and The Rider, issued by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. in February 1937 and subsequently reprinted by Grosset & Dunlap in 1937, 1938 and 1940. The story's first independent book publication was in a paperback edition from Ace Books in July 1974. Subsequent hardcover editions were issued by Buccaneer (1977) and Ameron; a subsequent paperback edition was issued by Charter (1979). Most editions omit the original ending, consisting of the last 174 lines of the magazine version, though the Buccaneer and Charter editions restore it. Plot summary In the home of Jonas Prim, president of an Oakdale bank, a thief makes off with a servant's clothing and valuables belonging to Prim's daughter Abigail. Abigail is thought to be absent visiting Sam Benham, whom her parents want her to marry. Escaping, the thief later encounters a group of hobos and is taken for one of them, the Oskaloosa Kid. Two of the hobos attempt to murder the newcomer for the loot, who shoots at one and flees. Meanwhile, the Prims discover the theft and learn that Abigail never arrived at Benham's. The incidents are assumed to be connected to other crimes, the assault and robbery of John Baggs and the murder of Reginald Paynter, who had been seen with two men and a girl. The local paper speculates Abigail might have been involved with Paynter's murder. Mr. Prim hires a private eye. The thief encounters another vagrant, Bridge, and the two take refuge from a storm in the deserted Squibb house, site of an old murder. Nearby, a shot is heard from a passing car, from which a woman is thrown. The two take the unconscious woman into the house. There they discover a dead body and hear something in the cellar dragging a chain. They lock themselves in one of the rooms. The woman, reviving, reveals herself as the girl with Paynter. The other men in the car were Terry, the driver, and the Oskaloosa Kid. She says the Kid murdered Paynter and afterwards threw her from the car and shot at her when she wouldn't keep quiet. The two hobos pursuing the thief enter the house, find the body, and encounter the thing in the cellar. Bridge lets them in the room to save them from the thing, at which the thief shoots. The thing retreats. Later, as the storm dies down, they again hear its approach, and a woman's shriek. When all is silent they emerge to find the dead man gone. The hobos threaten to turn the thief in for Paynter's murder unless they are given a share of the loot. Bridge, with the thief's gun, forces them to leave without it. Afterwards the thief goes to a nearby farmhouse of the Case family to buy food and brags to the Cases' son Willie about the exploits of the Oskaloosa Kid. After the thief's departure the Cases hear about the Baggs, Paynter and Prim mysteries from the local postman. A car containing Burton, a private detective, and two others pulls up to the Squibb house, and Bridge, the thief and the woman flee into the woods. Burton goes to the Case farm and questions the family, after which Willie disappears. The detective apprehends the hobos Bridge had driven from the Squibb house and gets their story, after which he arrests them as material witnesses. He himself vanishes for a few minutes, supposedly in search of a notebook he says he lost; actually he has found the loot from the Baggs robbery, implicating his captives in that crime. In the woods Bridge and his companions come across a cabin where Giova, a gypsy girl, is digging a grave. Willie also turns up. Bridge and Giova exchange stories. He tells her he tracked her and the thing from the Squibb place; the thing is now revealed as her pet bear Beppo. She tells him the body from the house which she is burying is that of her father, a villainous drunk who died of a fit. Bridge suggests they join forces. His group helps her bury the body, and she disguises them as gypsies. Meanwhile, Willie, whom the thief has tried to bribe into silence, steals off and calls Burton. Burton, Jonas Prim and a posse join Willie and are led to the cabin while the two hobos in Burton's custody are sent to jail. Bridge's party is not found, but the gypsy's body is dug up. Willie testifies on the gypsy's death at the inquest. Later that night, by chance, he spies the fugitives hiding in an old mill and again goes to inform Burton. But the group of hobos of whom Burton's captives were members has also learned their whereabouts, and plots to murder Bridge and the thief for the latter's loot and return the girl, whom they take for Abigail, to Prim for the reward. The gang duly attack them, but chaos ensues when Beppo the bear comes to their defense. Burton's posse arrives and intervenes; the bear is killed and all the combatants taken captive. Bridge and the thief are jailed and endangered by a lynch mob. Burton questions the woman, now identified as Hettie Penning. She tells him how Paynter died at the hands of the Oskaloosa Kid, and that the thief is not the Kid. Her story is confirmed when it is learned that the real Kid has turned up, fatally injured from crashing the car, and has confessed to murdering Paynter and shooting Hettie. Burton and Prim go to the jail, where they find the mob about to lynch Bridge and the thief, who they believe have robbed and killed Abigail Prim, and Paynter as well. Bridge, who has deduced the truth about his companion, reveals that the \\"thief\\" is Abigail, and the possessions she \\"stole\\" are her own property. Burton and Prim intervene and free the prisoners, whose secrets are now revealed. Abigail had run away so she would not have to marry Sam Benham. Bridge too is a runaway, having abandoned his own wealthy family to ride the rails. Burton has long been searching for him on commission from his father. In the end all is resolved satisfactorily Hettie takes on Giova as her maid, and Bridge and Abigail realize they have fallen in love with each other, which they seal with a kiss. In light of what Burton has revealed about Bridge, the prospects for their romance appear bright.

It was established for the United States defense of the Kingdom of Iceland during World War II. It was inactivated on 4 March 1947. History =Origins= Temporary Supply Dump in Reykjavik 1941 Building Nissen Huts in a gale 1942 Iceland was an important steppingstone between Europe and the New World in North America. Hitler several times toyed with the idea of a descent upon the island and laid preliminary plans for it; but to forestall such a move British troops, soon joined by a Canadian force, had landed in Iceland on 10 May 1940. Icelandic annoyance with the British and Canadian garrison, and British losses in the war, which made a withdrawal of the Iceland garrison seem desirable, plus the United States concern for the Atlantic sea lanes, combined to bring Iceland within the American defense orbit. In 1941, weakened by the withdrawal of some 50,000 troops in Greece and surprised by greatly reinforced German and Italian forces, Britain's Army of the Nile had been driven back, with serious losses, across the African deserts to the Egyptian border. Disaster in Greece, following hard upon the rout in North Africa, added 11,000 dead and missing to the casualties of the African campaign. The British therefore felt a pressing need for the 20,000 or so troops tied down in Iceland. Iceland, no less than Britain, was anxious to have the British garrison depart. Intensely nationalistic, proud of their ancient civilization, the Icelanders chafed under the \\"protective custody\\" in which they found themselves placed. They felt at first, when Canadian troops made up a large part of the total force, that a wholly British contingent would be preferable, but when the Canadians were later replaced by British troops most Icelanders seemed to find their lot no more bearable than before. As the scope of Germany's aerial blitzkrieg widened, the people of Iceland grew more uneasy; for it to be \\"defended\\" by one of the belligerent powers, they felt, was an open invitation to attack by the other. The Icelandic Government shared the apprehensions of the people and found further annoyance in Britain's control of Iceland's export trade. The Icelandic Government had, as early as mid-July 1940, approached the United States Department of State concerning the possibility of Iceland's coming under the aegis of the Monroe Doctrine. The Department of State was unwilling to take a firm decision, and said it did not want to tie its hands. Then came the British reverses in the Mediterranean and increasing German success in the North Atlantic. On 10 April 1941, while picking up survivors from a Dutch vessel torpedoed off the coast of Iceland, the American destroyer Niblach, which earlier in the month had been given the job of reconnoitering the waters about the island, went into action against a U-boat whose approach was taken as an intention to attack. This was the first of a number of \\"incidents\\" that were to take place in the waters south of Iceland, where from this time forward the safety zone of the Western Hemisphere and Germany's blockade area overlapped. On 13 April President Roosevelt received assurances from Prime Minister Churchill that Britain was determined to fight through to a decision in North Africa. American goods and munitions would perhaps be the deciding factor in the campaign. Preparations for sending an Army survey party were made. Discussions between General Chaney's staff and British officers had begun on 4 June on such matters as housing the American troops, the antiaircraft defense of Iceland, and the necessary fighter plane strength; and it was decided that a joint Admiralty, Air, and War Ministry committee would collaborate with the Special Observer Group in planning the relief of the British forces. The War Department began its preliminary planning at once. Since only a meager body of firsthand data was available, the point of departure had to be the decision itself (that American troops would immediately and completely relieve the British garrison) and from that point planning had to proceed on the basis of the two known factors: that approximately 30,000 troops would be required. An agreement with the Government of Denmark was concluded on 7 July 1941 for the United States to relieve the British and Canadian forces on Iceland. Plans were made and on 5 September 1941, a convoy got under way for the movement of American Army troops to Iceland. Guarded through coastal waters by vessels of the First and Third Naval Districts, the transports and accompanying freighters on the following day picked up their ocean escort and destroyer screen at a meeting point off the coast of Maine. Four days later, during the night of 15‚Äì16 September, the convoy reached Iceland safely. =United States Army= US Army Troops Arriving in Reykjavik January 1942 Camp Pershing, Iceland 1942 As outposts of defense, the North Atlantic bases were only imperceptibly affected by the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941. More than two months before, instructions had gone out to the American garrisons to dispute actively the approach of any Axis military plane or naval vessel. Iceland had gone on the alert even earlier. The ultimate decision that would bring into action the guns of the American garrisons had thus rested with Hitler and on his view of what was expedient. It had not depended on America's status, whether of belligerency, nonbelligerency, or neutrality. In recognition of these circumstances, reinforcements had been dispatched to the Atlantic outposts throughout most of 1941. This is not to say that the bases in the Atlantic escaped, even for a time, the hard impact of war. The affirmation in the ARCADIA Conference (the Anglo-American conference in Washington, December 1941 ‚Äì January 1942) of the strategy of concentrating an American air force in the United Kingdom acted as a catalyst on the hitherto uncertain and somewhat nebulous proposals that the United States take over the North Atlantic air route-the shortest path between America and the European front. As way stations on this route both Greenland and Iceland now acquired a new importance, in which Newfoundland, as one of the terminal points, shared. The United States Forces remained directly under General Headquarters, United States Army until 16 June 1942 when the Icelandic Defense Command was established. IDF was placed under the jurisdiction of the CG ETOUSA for training and operations. At the same time, it remained under the War Department for administrative purposes and continued to be supplied by the United States Navy and United States Army Air Forces. In March 1943, the commanding general, Iceland Base Command was charged with the defense of the territory of Iceland under his control and the training of units under his command in accord with directives issued by the commanding general, European Theater of Operations, United States Army (ETOUSA). In addition he was to comply with whatever special and specific instructions the CG ETOUSA might from time to time direct. Defense and training remained the primary mission o the command after its removal from ETOUSA Control. Of the four outposts in the North Atlantic, Iceland alone presented a major, immediate problem. The reinforcement of Newfoundland and Bermuda would require the transportation of comparatively small numbers and the distances were not great. Greenland would be frozen in until spring. Furthermore, early plans and prior commitments and the desire of the British to transfer their garrison gave Iceland a special position in the tug of European strategy After the arrival of the December troop convoy a battalion of marines had taken over the positions of one of the British infantry battalions, which was immediately returned to the United Kingdom. Then the 2nd Battalion, 10th Infantry, which arrived in the January convoy, took over from the marine battalion and it returned to the United States. No troops arrived in February. In March a small British force and the last remaining units of the marine brigade departed upon the arrival of the 2nd Infantry (minus one battalion) and accompanying units. A large American convoy arrived in mid-April and another in May with a total of about 8,700 troops, and this enabled most of the remaining British troops to be withdrawn. After 11 May only the British 146 Infantry Brigade, distributed among the three outports of Akureyri, Seydisfjordur, and Budareyri, and some Royal Air Force units remained. The better part of the job the United States had undertaken twelve months before was accomplished. There were now, at the beginning of June 1942, about 24,000 American troops in Iceland; but in the meantime Iceland's defense requirements had risen. The building of the Keflavik airfields, air ferrying activity, and troop transport operations over the sea lanes, and the fact that the United States had become one of the belligerents all meant that the size of the garrison had to be revised upward. Shortly after Iceland's inclusion in June in the new European Theater of Operations, large additions to the American forces arrived in July, August, October, and December, so that by the end of 1942 the garrison in Iceland had grown to approximately 38,000 men stationed at nearly 300 camps and posts. =Air Transport Command= Air Transport Command emblem North Atlantic air ferry routes to England, 1945. The Army Air Forces, GHQ AF, and the Iceland Base Command had for some time been united in favor of a heavy bomber field in Iceland in 1941. During November and December 1941 site and soil surveys, reports, and recommendations had been made, every one of them favorable. With the concurrence of the Air Forces, that the Army Engineers at once begin construction of an airfield in the vicinity of Keflavik suitable for heavy bombers and that the necessary funds be provided. In the meantime, commander of the Iceland Base Command's air forces, had been unobtrusively getting the construction of a new fighter field under way as part of the basic defense mission. As soon as the bomber field received official approval, the fighter field was fitted into the project as a satellite field. Thus, considerable progress had already been made by the time the first civilian construction gangs arrived in May. However, the need by Army Air Corps Ferrying Command (later:Air Transport Command) for a transient ferrying airfield on Iceland and the availability of bomber bases in England led to Ferrying Command taking jurisdiction of the planned airfields near Keflavik. Ultimately both a long- range transport airfield, used for ferrying multi-engine bombers was constructed, as well as a fighter airfield for the air defense of Iceland. Construction work on the main ferrying and transport airfield, Meeks Field, was started on 2 July by the Army Corps of Engineers and was taken over in August by one of the first Navy Seabee units organized on Iceland. A B-18 Bolo bomber, carrying high-ranking officers and their guests, made the first landing at Meeks Field on 24 March 1943. All major construction, including four 6,500 ft (2,000 m) runways were completed by the end of July 1943. Meeks became headquarters for Iceland Base Command. Its long runway was used for ferrying of multi-engined aircraft on flights between the US and the UK. The major American military units at Meeks Field were: * 824th Engineering Battalion (Aviation) (February 1942 ‚Äì 28 August 1943) * 342nd Composite Group : HQ located at Meeks Field, Squadrons operated from Patterson Field, (11 September 1942 ‚Äì 18 March 1944) * 14th Det, North Atlantic Wing, Air Transport Command (ATC Station #14), (28 August 1943 ‚Äì 1 August 1944) * Iceland Base Command (16 June 1942 ‚Äì 24 March 1947) * 2nd Service Group, 29 March 1943 ‚Äì 1 October 1945 : 14th Air Service Squadron, 1 October-28 December 1945 * 1386th Army Air Force Base Unit (1 August 1944 ‚Äì 18 February 1946) Army Engineers were also set to work on construction of Patterson Field (Originally Svidningar field), as the satellite airfield to Meeks was soon named. Completed before Meeks became operational, the first planes of the Eighth Air Force began coming through Patterson on their way to England, early in July 1942 when two of its three runways were in use. With the opening of Meeks it was primarily used by Iceland Base Command as a fighter base by the 342nd Composite Group for air defense, however it remained in use by ATC as an overflow base for ferrying single-engine aircraft on the North Atlantic Transport Route due to its short runways and congestion at Meeks. At the peak of the Second World War, thousands of USAAF airmen were stationed at the airfields (Meeks and Patterson ) near Keflavik in temporary Quonset hut camps. Reykjav√≠k Airport, , first used in 1919 as a grass civil airfield, was rebuilt for the Royal Air Force in October 1940 as RAF Reykjavik. It was used as a civil/military airfield during the war and remained under RAF jurisdiction, however it was also used by ATC as an overflow base. By the end of November 1943 the Greenland airfields had been completely graded and surfaced. All the links in the \\"Snowball\\" or North Atlantic air ferry route to England had been filled in. \\"The major problems concerned with aircraft ferrying had been largely solved,\\" states the official history of the Air Transport Command. \\"Ferrying had become virtually a routine operation.\\" = 342nd Composite Group = American Fighter Planes over Camp Artun, 1943 Lockheed P-38F-5-LO Lightning 42-12596 of the 50th Fighter Squadron in Iceland, 1942 The 342nd Composite Group was activated at Meeks Field on 11 September 1942, however its aircraft operated largely from Patterson Field due to the congestion of ATC traffic at Meeks. It reported directly to the HQ, IBC. The group flew a mixture of P-38 Lightning and P-40 Warhawk fighters, as well as some B-18 Bolos and P-39 Airacobras assigned to the Group's Base Flight. Operational squadrons were: * 33rd Fighter Squadron, (P-40s), 11 September 1942 ‚Äì 18 March 1944 * 50th Fighter Squadron (P-38s), 14 November 1942 ‚Äì 1 February 1944 * 337th Fighter Squadron (P-38s), 11 September ‚Äì 26 November 1942 The group's mission was the aerial defense of Iceland by intercepting and destroying some of the German planes that on occasion attempted to attack Iceland or that appeared in that area on reconnaissance missions. The unit also conducted antisubmarine patrols in the North Atlantic and provided cover for convoys on the run to Murmansk, Soviet Union. The USAAF first engaged enemy forces near Iceland on 28 April 1942 and had been followed by a three months' lull. Then in late July three more encounters took place. Up to this point the honors had gone to the Norwegian patrol squadron, which, under RAF command, was operating off the northern and eastern coast; but it was not long before the American air forces in Iceland had their chances at the Nazis. Having missed being the first to engage the enemy, an American plane became the first to bring one down. On the morning of 14 August 1942 two American fighter pilots, Lt. E. E. Shahan and Lt. J. D. Shaffer, intercepted and destroyed a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 about ten miles north of Reykjav√≠k. It was the first German plane of the war to be shot down by the Army Air Forces. During the next two months American fighter planes of the Iceland Base Command bagged two more German planes, intercepted and attacked seven, and unsuccessfully tried to intercept three others. Planes of the Norwegian RAF squadron, meanwhile, had met and attacked three German aircraft with varying degrees of success, and during the same period the ground troops opened fire on German planes a dozen times. A few planes appeared during the winter, but none was intercepted and only two came under antiaircraft fire. Some of this air activity over the North Atlantic was undoubtedly related to the enemy's efforts to set up weather and radio stations in Greenland. The spring of 1943 promised to be just as lively. In April German planes were spotted or reported on at least ten occasions. One of the intruders, a Junkers Ju 88 bomber, was shot down at the end of the month by two planes of the 50th Fighter Squadron. Throughout the year the number of enemy or unidentified planes reported was about 15 percent less than in 1942. Actual contacts were considerably fewer. Apparently the German planes were successfully avoiding the antiaircraft defenses and evading the American fighters. On 5 August American planes, making their second interception of the year, shot down another German bomber, the fifth and last enemy plane to be destroyed over Iceland. After the summer of 1943, little German activity was noted over the North Atlantic skies. The enemy was on the defensive, and the American defensive outposts in the Atlantic (Iceland, Greenland, Newfoundland and Bermuda) were shifting to secondary roles. The 342nd Composite Group was inactivated on 18 March 1944. Its squadrons were reassigned to England and the Eighth and Ninth Air Forces. IBC was removed from ETOUA and transferred to the jurisdiction of the Army Eastern Defense Command, 30 July 1944. It was further transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Army Air Forces effective 1 January 1946. =Postwar era= : See Naval Air Station Keflavik for NATO activities in Iceland, 1951‚Äì2006 Following World War II, all United States military personnel were withdrawn from Iceland as specified in the original agreement. All United States Army and Naval forces were withdrawn by the end of 1945. Reykjav√≠k Airport was turned over to Icelandic government by the RAF on 6 July 1946. Another agreement signed between the United States and Iceland in 1946 permitted continued use of Keflavik Airport for flights in support of occupation forces in Europe. The United States provided all the maintenance and operation of Keflavik Airport through an American civilian contractor. Once the civil infrastructure was in place, Iceland Base Command was discontinued on 24 March 1947 and USAAF air activity ended at both Patterson and Meeks (Keflavik Airport) Field on 31 March 1947. Iceland's charter membership in NATO in 1949 required neither the establishment of an Icelandic armed force, nor the stationing of foreign troops in the country during peacetime. However, the Cold War with the Soviet Union and growing world tensions caused Iceland's leaders to think otherwise. Icelandic officials decided that membership in the NATO alliance was not a sufficient defense and, at the request of NATO, entered into a defense agreement with the United States. This was the beginning of the Iceland Defense Force. During the past four decades, the Defense Force was \\"at the front\\" of the Cold War and was credited with playing a significant role in deterrence, and in 1951, the United States Air Force re-established a presence in Iceland, and the former Meeks Field, now known as Keflavik Airport, which became a NATO transport and interceptor base during the Cold War.

Following the conclusion of the \\"Flashpoint\\" crossover storyline, DC canceled all of its existing titles and debuted 52 new series in September 2011 with new first issues as a partial reboot. Among the renumbered series were Action Comics and Detective Comics, which had retained their original numbering since the 1930s. The relaunch included changes to the publishing format; for example, print and digital comics began to be released on the same day. New titles were released to bring the number of ongoing monthly series to 52. Various changes were also made to DC's fictional universe to entice new readers, including changes to DC's internal continuity to make characters more modern and accessible. In addition, characters from the Wildstorm and Vertigo imprints were absorbed into the DC Universe. The New 52 branding ended after the completion of the \\"Convergence\\" storyline in May 2015, although the continuity of The New 52 continued. In June 2015, 24 new titles were launched, alongside 25 returning titles, with several of those receiving new creative teams.

The new continuity features new outfits and backstories for many of DC's long-established heroes and villains. An interview with DC Comics executive editor Eddie Berganza and editor-in-chief Bob Harras revealed that the new continuity did not constitute a full reboot of the DC Universe but rather a \\"soft reboot\\". While many characters underwent a reboot or revamp, much of the DC Universe's history remained intact. Many major storylines such as \\"War of the Green Lanterns\\", \\"Batman: A Death in the Family\\" and Batman: The Killing Joke remained part of the new continuity, while others have been lost in part or in whole. DC editorial constructed a timeline that details the new history and which storylines to keep or ignore. On August 31, 2011, Midtown Comics Times Square held a midnight event at which they began selling Justice League #1 and Flashpoint #5. On hand to sign the books were DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns, who was the writer of both titles, and Co- publisher and writer/artist Jim Lee, who illustrated Justice League. On January 12, 2012, DC announced that after their eighth issues, Blackhawks, Hawk and Dove, Men of War, Mister Terrific, O.M.A.C., and Static Shock would be cancelled and replaced with six new titles, which would reveal more of The New 52 DC Universe.

Threshold would be published in January 2013, Constantine in March 2013, while the others would be published in February 2013. DC later consolidated these new titles as the Fourth Wave of The New 52. G.I. Combat, Frankenstein, Agent of S.H.A.D.E., Grifter, Blue Beetle, and Legion Lost were cancelled as a result. Young Romance: A New 52 Valentine's Day Special #1 was published as the 52nd title in February 2013.

DC has used the Green Lantern: Rebirth and The Flash: Rebirth miniseries as examples of the basis for the initiative, which has been described as a rebirth of the DC Universe. The Rebirth initiative reintroduced concepts from pre-Flashpoint continuity, such as legacy, that had been lost with The New 52 and built \\"on everything that's been published since Action Comics #1 up through The New 52.\\" Changes to the DC Universe Scott Snyder and Ivan Brandon at a September 21, 2011, signing for Batman #1 and Men of War #1 at Midtown Comics In June 2011, DC Co-Publisher Jim Lee revealed that he and DC Art Director Mark Chiarello had enlisted artist Cully Hamner to help spearhead the redesign of characters for the relaunch of the DC Universe. In late July 2011, DC released The New 52, a free preview book giving solicitations and previews of all of the new titles launching from August 31, 2011. Notable continuity changes shown included Superman's two new looks: one which consists of jeans, a blue T-shirt with the \\"S\\" logo and a cape, the other consisting of Kryptonian battle armor that resembles his classic costume. Other notable changes included the integration of the Wildstorm imprint's characters into DC continuity, with Martian Manhunter as a part of the new Stormwatch team in the relaunched Stormwatch series. Justice League was the first book of the relaunch, with the first issue released on August 31, 2011. The first story arc takes place five years in the past, detailing the first meeting of the Justice League members and the formation of the team. The initial run of first issues show a universe in which superheroes have only appeared within the last five years and are viewed with suspicion and hostility, with Superman and Batman being pursued by the police five years ago at the start of their careers. In the present day, organizations such as the United Nations and the United States government seek to exploit and control the superheroes through groups such as the Justice League International and the Justice League of America. The \\"Batman\\" family of titles strongly resemble the past continuity. However, former Batgirls Stephanie Brown and Cassandra Cain have had their histories erased. Additionally, all of the Robins have been accounted for, including the previously non-canonical Carrie Kelley. Stephanie Brown made her first appearance in The New 52 as the Spoiler in the teaser issue to Batman Eternal in Batman #28. Barbara Gordon recovered from the paralysis inflicted upon her by the Joker's bullet in Batman: The Killing Joke and returned to crimefighting as Batgirl. As for Superman, his romantic relationship and marriage to Lois Lane has not transpired, and his adoptive parents Jonathan and Martha Kent have died. He was depicted as being slightly more short- tempered, retaining his American identity, and in a relationship with Wonder Woman. Various character changes were implemented, such as Starfire, Guy Gardner, and Tim Drake having their origins significantly changed. Sinestro was depicted as having returned recently to the Green Lantern Corps, where he became a villain again. Meanwhile, the Earth-Two version of Alan Scott was depicted as gay. Publications =Imprint titles= The imprint titles are divided into seven families of titles, revolving around central characters or themes. By the release of the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. Instead they began releasing one larger solicit, titled \\"The New 52 Group\\". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as \\"Forever Evil\\", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. The original Justice League team, as they appear in The New 52; art by Jim Lee *\\"Justice League\\" ‚Äì These titles featured characters related to the Justice League. *\\"Batman\\" ‚Äì These titles featured Batman and the \\"Batman Family\\" of characters. *\\"Superman\\" ‚Äì These titles featured Superman and the \\"Superman Family\\" of characters. *\\"Green Lantern\\" ‚Äì These titles featured the members of the Green Lantern Corps and the other Lantern Corps of the emotional spectrum. *\\"Young Justice\\" ‚Äì These titles featured teenaged characters and superhero teams. *\\"The Edge\\" ‚Äì These are titles with war, science fiction, western, or crime themes, and include titles and characters formerly belonging to the WildStorm imprint. *\\"The Dark\\" ‚Äì These are titles with supernatural, fantasy and horror themes, including titles and characters formerly belonging to the Vertigo imprint. =Post-imprint titles= In February 2015, it was revealed that after the Convergence miniseries in June 2015, DC would no longer use The New 52 name to brand their books; however the continuity established in September 2011 would continue. Dan DiDio stated, \\"In this new era of storytelling, story will trump continuity as we continue to empower creators to tell the best stories\\". The new titles would be about \\"reinventing key characters\\", such as Black Canary, Cyborg, Bizarro, and Starfire, with a new \\"contemporary tonality to ensure a diverse offering of comic books.\\" In the initial \\"relaunch\\", 24 new publications joined 25 existing publications from before Convergence, with new titles continuing to be added. In March 2015, DiDio revealed there would not be an \\"overarching brand on this\\" stating the relaunch was just \\"DC Comics, pure and simple.\\" However, in May 2015, DC announced the advertising campaign DC You for the relaunch, which highlighted the four main themes of characters, talent, stories and fans. The initiative, which began in DC's print and digital comics on May 20, before transitioning to other digital content on June 3, was featured on print inserts and ads, as well as on the DC Comics website and across social media with a special hashtag of #DCYou. Reception =Sales= Jim Lee and Geoff Johns at a May 11, 2012 signing for the Justice League Vol. 1: Origin, the hardcover which collected the first six-issue story arc of that series Pre-orders for Justice League #1 exceeded 200,000 copies. Justice League #1 has been sent back to press at least four times and all of The New 52's first issue titles sold out by September 24, 2011. For the month of September 2011, DC had eight of the top ten comic books, in spite of Marvel's heavily publicized replacement Ultimate Spider-Man, Miles Morales debuting in that title the same month. Justice League #1 was the top selling comic book in 2011. Writer Warren Ellis was unimpressed with the relaunch's sales, stating that it garnered DC a half- point lead in dollar share and a five-point lead in units sold over Marvel Comics. Ellis also pointed out that the units DC sold are returnable. Columnist Heidi MacDonald stated that while the market share comparisons are correct, the sales figures for single issue books do not take into account the fact that returnable comics are downgraded by approximately 10%, and that DC's sales are about that amount lower than the actual sales, in order to allow for potential returns. MacDonald opined that while the sellouts and reprintings make returns unlikely, the sales will remain 10% lower throughout the period the books can be returned, which will last through December, and that actual sales would be adjusted for this factor in Diamond Comic Distributors' end of year figures. Writer and ComicMix columnist Glenn Hauman wrote that relying solely on Diamond's numbers, to the exclusion of newsstand, overseas and digital sales, does not provide a complete measure of the relaunch's success. Hauman emphasized that the infinite long-term availability of digital editions will mean that sales will continue on the books for weeks and months afterwards, and that the market share for that market is uncertain. By December 2011, Marvel Comics regained the top spot for market share in both dollars and units. In April 2013, DC's unit share fell below 28%, but rose to a 45.17% market share in September due to high orders for Villain Month. It fell back to 30.77% by January 2014. =Critical reception= Forbes, The New York Times and The A.V. Club saw The New 52 as a good editorial move from DC. The Christian Science Monitors Rich Clabaugh cited the relaunched Action Comics and Detective Comics as the strongest of the first week's releases. In terms of the books themselves, Keith Phipps and Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club praised the art in Justice League #1, but thought its writing and structure was a weak point. In all, the two reviewers named O.M.A.C., Captain Atom, Animal Man and Wonder Woman their favorite books of the relaunch. They gave Batman high praise, and enjoyed Action Comics, Swamp Thing, Batwoman, Frankenstein Agent Of S.H.A.D.E., Demon Knights, Batman and Robin, Nightwing, Aquaman, The Flash, All Star Western, and Voodoo. However, they both disliked Detective Comics, Hawk and Dove, Legion Lost, Red Lanterns, Legion Of Super- Heroes, DC Universe Presents: Deadman, Superman, Batman: The Dark Knight, The Fury of Firestorm: The Nuclear Men, and The Savage Hawkman. On the remaining titles, the reviewers were either split, or exhibited mixed reactions ranging from indifference to cautious optimism or curiosity. Corrina Lawson of Wired dubbed the New 52 \\"a big, fat failure\\" from a reader standpoint, noting that the same stories could have been told without rebooting the fictional universe. She did, however, state that the New 52 was good from a business perspective, as it led to an increased market share for DC. Criticism =Lack of female creators= The launch of the New 52 was criticized for the lack of female creators, which had dropped from 12% to 1%, the latter figure represented by writer Gail Simone and Amy Reeder, an alternating artist on Batwoman who would not debut on that title until issue #6. This led to a tense interaction between fans and DC Comics co-publisher Dan DiDio at the 2011 San Diego Comic Con, where DiDio was asked by a fan about the drop in female creators from 12% to 1%. DiDio responded saying, \\"What do those numbers mean to you? What do they mean to you? Who should we be hiring? Tell me right now. Who should we be hiring right now? Tell me.\\" In an editorial responding to DiDio, Comics Alliance editor-in-chief Laura Hudson wrote, \\"Women are half of the world, and a significant percentage of the DC Comics character stable, and yet only 1% of their creators. And the way that you treat and represent half of the people in your world--and by extension, half of the people in the real world who might potentially buy your books--should be more than a marginal concern.\\" On July 29, 2011, DC released a letter addressing the lack of female creators on their official blog, highlighting notable female creators currently being published by them and promising more in the future. Hudson called the letter \\"an enormous and very positive departure from how DC Comics has dealt with controversies about gender and race in the past, which was almost uniformly not to comment\\", adding, \\"While it remains to be seen what sort of meaningful changes in either attitudes or hiring practices will follow, it certainly leaves me feeling more optimistic than I have in some time, or maybe ever.\\" =Portrayal of female characters= DC also received criticism for its handling of certain female characters during the relaunch, sparking discussion of exploitative overtones in titles such as Catwoman #1 and Red Hood and the Outlaws #1. Laura Hudson of ComicsAlliance and Andrew Wheeler of Bleeding Cool criticized the relaunch for oversexualized characterization of its female characters, such as Catwoman, Harley Quinn, Starfire and Voodoo, for cancelling books with female leads like Power Girl, and relegating the star of that series to the status of Mister Terrific's girlfriend. Writer/editor Jim Shooter disliked the treatment of female characters in general, and referred to the treatment of Starfire in particular as \\"porn for kids\\". Keith Phipps and Oliver Sava agreed with the observations of Catwoman and Red Hood and the Outlaws, but opined that Voodoo was a positive example how to incorporate a female character's sexuality as a relevant aspect of the story without appearing exploitative. Wheeler also complained that retconning Barbara Gordon's paralysis as a temporary injury from which she recovered, and restoring her as Batgirl, to the exclusion of Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown, made the DC Universe less diverse and inclusive. Responding to the criticism, Catwoman writer Judd Winick explained that it was DC that desired this tone for that book. Restoration of Barbara Gordon's mobility and aftermath In June 2011, DC announced that Barbara Gordon would be returning to the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement became one of the most controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle have expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that: Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that: Former Batman writer and editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander expressed disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, \\"[W]e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals ... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective in a way that didn't involve violence.\\" However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, \\"Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration.\\" Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that \\"[t]imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era ... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm sure her work will be wonderful.\\" =Editorial controversies= A number of editorial controversies emerged in the wake of The New 52, prompting Topless Robot, a genre website owned by The Village Voice, to publish an article in September 2013, \\"The Eight Biggest DC Creative Screw-Ups Since the New 52 Began\\". A number of these controversies concerned firings or resignations of creators, which in some cases, stemmed from conflicts between those creators and editorial decisions. Writer/artist George P√©rez, who left Superman after six issues, explained his departure in July 2012 as a result of the level of editorial oversight exerted on the title. This included the inconsistent reasons given for rewrites of his material, the inability of editors to answer basic questions about the new Superman's status quo, such as whether his adoptive parents were still alive, and the restrictions created by not being told that Action Comics, with which Superman had to remain consistent, was set five years before Superman, a situation complicated by the fact that Action writer Grant Morrison was not forthcoming about his plans. In the following month Rob Liefeld, who had been hired by DC to plot Grifter and The Savage Hawkman, and to plot and draw Deathstroke, and who had indicated the previous month that his run on those titles would last into 2013, announced that he was quitting DC Comics, with his last issues being the #0 issues to be published that September. Though he characterized his experience on The New 52 as positive overall, he did not disguise his animosity toward editor Brian Smith, with whom he clashed, being among his reasons for leaving the company. Other reasons he cited were frequent rewrites of his material, and the overall corporate culture that was more prevalent now that both DC and Marvel were owned by large media conglomerates. Liefeld also referred to Scott Clark's artwork on Grifter as \\"crap\\". In response to these events, artist Pete Woods defended DC editorial, stating that the restrictions placed on creators was the result of a plan they had for all 52 of their titles that required them to be consistent with one another. Marvel's Senior Vice President of Publishing Tom Brevoort and writer Gail Simone defended Brian Smith, disputing Liefeld's characterization of him, leading to a heated exchange on Twitter between Liefeld and Brevoort, and eventually head Batman writer Scott Snyder as well. In late November 2012, Rich Johnston of Bleeding Cool had noted the possibility of Gail Simone leaving Batgirl and possibly DC Comics as a whole. In December 2012, Gail Simone had revealed that she was no longer the writer of Batgirl, despite the title being a consistent top-seller which had received favorable reviews. She had been informed by her new editor, Brian Cunningham, via e-mail of the creative change. Ray Fawkes would fill-in for two issues, Batgirl #17 and 18. Twelve days after being fired, however, Gail Simone had announced that she had been re-hired as the writer of Batgirl, and that she would return following Fawkes' issues. In March 2013, both Andy Diggle and Joshua Hale Fialkov announced that they would be leaving their writing duties at DC Comics. Diggle had previously signed as ongoing writer of Action Comics starting with issue #19, following Grant Morrison's run on the title. However, Diggle later announced that he would be leaving the title before the first issue had even been published, citing professional reasons. He is credited as the sole writer in issue #19. Series artist Tony Daniel finished Diggle's work on the title as a scripter. Fialkov was signed to write both Red Lanterns and Green Lantern Corps following Geoff Johns's departure from the Green Lantern line, however, Fialkov left DC Comics without a single issue being written by him due to creative differences with editorial. In September 2013, J. H. Williams III and W. Haden Blackman announced their intention to leave Batwoman with issue 26, citing last-minute editorial changes as the reason. Among these editorial decisions was a prohibition on having the title character marry her fianc√©e Maggie Sawyer. Co-Publisher Dan DiDio explained that the major superheroes in the Batman family of books should not get married because finding true happiness would undermine the angst and turmoil that typify those characters, and their commitment to the superhero lives they lead. Writer Marc Andreyko, who is openly gay himself, took over the title with issue 25, which featured a \\"Batman: Zero Year\\" tie-in. This creative change interrupted the finale to Williams' and Blackman's work on the title; they had already written issues 25 and 26 prior to their departure. Andreyko resolved Batwoman #24's cliffhanger ending in Batwoman Annual #1.

Organization and mandate The APESB was established by CPA Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia in February 2006, and later that year the National Institute of Accountants (now called the Institute of Public Accountants) became the third member of the APESB. The three organizations jointly fund the APESB. Members of these three major Australian accounting bodies have a responsibility to act in the public interest. They are expected to act with objectivity and integrity in their dealings with investors, governments, clients, employers and employees. Governance The Accounting Professional & Ethical Standards Board (APESB) corporate structure is one of a company limited by guarantee. The role, structure and responsibilities of the Board of Directors is outlined in the Board Charter. Relationship to international standards Where relevant, APESB has adopted appropriate professional and ethical standards issued by a standard setting board of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Whilst the applicable APESB standards remain consistent with IFAC standards, additional requirements or guidance may be included, taking into consideration the Australian environment. The 2006 version of the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants was based on the code issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants (IESBA) of the IFAC, but some provisions were amended to align with Australian legislation. When a revised version of the Code of Ethics was issued in December 2010, reflecting changes to the IESBA code issued in July 2009, the specific Australian requirements were omitted, replaced with a warning that accountants were also required to comply with legislation such as the Corporations Act 2001. The APESB contributes to development of international standards through submissions to the IESBA and as a member of the IESBA National Standards Setters group. Activities APESB develops new and revised standards, taking into consideration market and stakeholder needs. APESB follows a rigorous process in developing professional and ethical standards, based on a well- documented process, which is available at: https://web.archive.org/web/20140126043225/http://apesb.org.au/uploads/apesb- work-programs/revised-due-process-dec-2013-final.pdf.

Westergasfabriek was ready in 1885 and was strategically situated between the Haarlemmer trekvaart, and the first railway line in the Netherlands. In 1885 it was the largest gas extraction plant in the Netherlands. The gas was extracted from coal and was used for street lighting. Because of the higher gas prices the City of Amsterdam took over the operation in 1898 and expanded the plant. The plant was perfectly situated between the water and the railway line but gas production was very successful. The big Gasholder was built in 1902. The gas factory produced gas for the city until the late fifties. Amsterdam went over to gas from Hoogovens in IJmuiden, so the production of coal gas from the Factory decreased. In the sixties natural gas was found in Slochteren in the North of the Netherlands. This is why in 1967 the production of gas from the Factory stopped permanently. After the Western Gas Factory closed the Amsterdam Electricity and Gas Company (GEB) destroyed some of the buildings among them the gas plant itself and the water tower. The other buildings were used for storage and repair and as laboratories and workshops. The remaining buildings were recognised as monuments in 1989.http://www.iamsterdam.com/en- GB/experience/about-amsterdam/areas/amsterdam- neighbourhoods/westerpark/Westergasfabriek In 1992 the GEB left the buildings and they were taken over by the District Council of Westerpark.  Redevelopment  Most of the thirteen buildings on site were designed by architect Isaac Gosschalk in the Dutch Neo Renaissance style, popular in the Netherlands between 1870 and 1915. Gosschalk was a famous architect in his time, as famous as Pierre Cuypers and Dolf van Gendt. He was a Jewish architect and he mainly built factories among them the Heineken brewery which is unfortunately completely destroyed and the railway station of Groningen. Gosschalk united the functional nature of the buildings with the beauty of architecture. Symmetry played an important role in his design. Thirteen of the original buildings remain on the site (not all by Gosschalk) and are designated as national monuments. In the eighties the City of Amsterdam started to think about redevelopment but found out that the site was heavily polluted. In the nineties the District Council of Westerpark took over the responsibilities for the redevelopment. There were four main problems: remediation of the pollution, constructing a new park, finding new use for the derelict buildings and the overall problem: a lack of money.  Culture Park  The gas works were re-opened as the \\"Culture Park Westergasfabriek\\" in 2003. Its television studios host programmes like Pauw & Witteman (a former late night talkshow), De Wereld Draait Door (an early evening talk show with Matthijs van Nieuwkerk) and Eva Jinek's Sunday morning talk show. The main grass field of the park allows for six festivals to be organized annually. Thousands of people visit the park and its activities every day.

For their services to the field of arts, the Government of India have conferred on them the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan awards. Education and family Raja Reddy holds a Diploma in Choreography and has a bachelor's degree from the Osmania University. Radha Reddy also has a Diploma in Choreography.

Raja Reddy is married to Radha and her sister Kaushalya, also a Kuchipudi dancer. Raja Radha Reddy and Kaushalya have two children Yamini and Bhavana Reddy, also Kuchipudi dancers. Performing career Raja Reddy's interest in Kuchipudi began in childhood as he watched performances of Kuchipudi Bhagavatam by touring folk troupes in his home district of Adilabad and later reached a turning point after he saw a performance of Vyjayanthimala‚Äôs Nagin. Radha followed him into Kuchipudi after their wedding. The duo learnt Kuchipudi under their guru Vedantam Prahalada Sarma of Eluru. In 1966, on a Government of Andhra Pradesh scholarship, they went to Delhi where they studied choreography and other stage arts under Guru Maya Rao at Natya Ballet Centre. Their talent was soon noted and they were invited to dance with doyen of the time including Indrani Rehman. Their first big break came in 1970 when their performance at the Theatre Tamil Nadu was widely well reviewed and received. Their performances were also noted by the then Minister for Tourism, Dr. Karan Singh and by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi who allotted them a house in Delhi after witnessing their performance during the celebrations of Nehru's birth anniversary. They have since gone on to perform at venues all over the globe. Raja trained students with hearing and speech impairment and at the Blind Relief Association. He has also set to dance a piece based on three poems of former President APJ Abdul Kalam. In their careers spanning over five decades and still counting, Drs.Raja and Radha Reddy are the first Indian dancers to perform in the International Dance Festival of Avignon in France and Salzburg (Austria) and the Festivals of India in the USA, UK and Bangladesh.

Mr and Mrs. Babani did not hear Aakhri's comments and Chintu verbally abuses Babani while shouting. Babani suffers from a condition that affects his heart when he hears loud noises. Due to Chintu's shouting, Babani suffers a heart attack, landing him in a hospital. Babani's son Jai (Shreyas Talpade) comes to know of this and gets angry, then vows revenge, telling his friend Jolly (Ritesh Deshmukh), who is the son of billionaire J.D. (Mithun Chakraborty), to go to Chintu, agree to marry his daughter and then break off the wedding at the last minute. Jolly is busy trying to introduce his girlfriend J-Lo (Zarine Khan) to his own father and does not want to get involved. He suggests Max (John Abraham), their former college mate and a pick-pocket, to do the job. Jay goes with Max as his driver but somehow, they end in the wrong house and go to Dabboo's house. Jai and Max later find out their mistake. Jai, still wanting revenge, doesn't know what to do and Jolly suggests another former sleazy college mate, Sunil a. k. a. Sunny (Akshay Kumar). Jolly goes with Sunny as his bodyguard because Max and Sunny are sworn enemies and as Dabboo's house and Chintu's house are right next to each other, their plan may get destroyed.

After Sunny fools Chintu, Chintu calls Dabboo in excitement and tells him that his daughter, Heena, is marrying Jolly, the son of J.D. Confused, and believing Max to be Jolly, Dabboo takes Max and Bobby to J.D.'s mansion. Sunny handles the situation well by fooling J.D. by taking the name of Goddess Bhadrakali as he is his true devotee and tells him that Max is Jolly's friend and Bobby is Max's fianc√© (though actually it is true) and Max's father is against his and Bobby's marriage. J.D. then welcomes Bobby, Max and her family to his house and tells them to stay there till Bobby and Max's marriage.

J-Lo gives Jolly/Jwala the ultimatum ‚Äî take me to your house or forget me. To help Jolly/Jwala, Sunny lies to J.D., saying that J-Lo is his fianc√©e, and J.D. again agrees to let her live there as Sunny takes the name of Goddess Bhadrakali. Sunny and Max lie to their respective fathers-in-law that the other guy is the son of J.D. and a maid servant in the mansion, creating much confusion. When Sunny's father as well as Max's 'Guru' tells them never to break anyone's heart, Sunny and Max tell the truth to Heena and Bobby. Enraged, Bobby and Heena slap Max and Sunny respectively and tell them that they never want to see their faces again. But thinking that instead of telling the truth, Sunny and Max could have done more wrong with them, the two sisters forgive the two boys on the very next day. There Jai and Jolly also let off their plan of revenge on Kapoors on Jai's father's advice. Then Heena proposes to Sunny in Sunny's style and Bobby proposes to Max in Max's style. On the day of the four couples' marriage, J.D. and the other brides' fathers learn the truth about the grooms and that they have been lying so far. Finally Bobby and Heena convince their fathers to forget their enmity and live together as blood brothers. Chintu and Dabboo join hands and so do their wives. But J.D. was not convinced by them telling the truth, so he turns back into Jagga Dacoit and starts frightening the families with his gun. He tries to shoot Sunny with his gun as Sunny runs towards J.D. to save him from the falling chandelier and then he understands what was happening. In the end, all the grooms marry their respective girlfriends.

Golden Globe Award winners Joseph Bottoms and Judy Davis are among the cast. The soundtrack for the film was provided by the Australian band, Sherbet. The film was released in Australia on 4 August 1977. Plot Tex (Bottoms) is an American working at a carnival in Queensland. At the carnival he befriends a boxer, Alby (Taylor) and they decide to travel together to Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast. They hitch a ride with Arnold (Clayton) but problems arise when Arnold makes unwanted advances towards Alby. Alby beats up Arnold and he and Tex flee with Arnold's suitcase and car. However, the case is full of cash and the car is stocked with marijuana. So it comes as no surprise that Arnold and his friends want them back. Tex and Alby later give a lift to a sixteen- year-old hitch-hiker, Lynn and try to pick up two women, Barbie and Susie. Tex gets thrown out of a night club and beaten up by a bouncer so Alby takes both girls to bed. Arnold sends thugs to get them so they end up hijacking a tourist bus.

It is a Swiss heritage site of national significance. History The Lords of Grandson were first mentioned in the second half of the 11th century, when the castle was built. It was sited on the shore of Lake Neuch√¢tel to control the coast road. The House of Grandson sired a number of powerful scions, including bishops of Basel, Lausanne, Toul and Verdun de Fabianis, Valeria, ed. (2013). Castles of the World. New York: Metro Books. p. 180ISBN 978-1-4351-4845-1 Over the following century, as the Lords of Grandson expanded their power, they often came into conflict with the nearby monastery of Romainm√¥tier. In the 13th century the castle was rebuilt by Otto I of Grandson. Otto I is the most famous of the Lords of Grandson. He was a close friend of Prince Edward of England and accompanied him in 1271 on the Crusades to the Holy Land. He participated on the side of the English king in the conquest of Wales in 1283. In 1291 he commanded the Crusader army that unsuccessfully attacked Acre. In 1313 he defeated the rebellious city of Lausanne, which had risen up against the bishop. In addition to being a military leader, he was a skilled diplomat and had the confidence of the Pope, the Emperor and the French and English kings. After he died in 1328, Otto's brother William moved to England, where he was also successful and was the founder of the line of the Lords of Grandisson. His son was John Grandisson, the Bishop of Exeter.Burgen.ch website accessed 9 June 2011 The main line of the House of Grandson remained close to the House of Savoy and possessed the confidence of the Count. At the end of the 14th century the Lords of Grandson began to decline. Hugo of Grandson was sentenced to death for allegedly forging documents, but fled to England, where he mysteriously died. Otto III was accused of having killed Amadeus VII, Count of Savoy, in a fight. In Bourg-en-Bresse in 1397 he agreed to a judicial duel to prove his innocence. He was beaten by his opponent, Gerhard von Estavayer. John II of Grandson was convicted of forgery and sedition against the Duke of Burgundy and sentenced to death by suffocation. When John II died, the power of the family died with him. The estate was confiscated and given to Margaret of M√ºmpelgard. Thereafter, there were several changes of ownership. Johann Stumpf Grandson Castle, aerial photo In the late 15th century, Grandson Castle belonged to Jacques de Savoie, an ally of Charles the Bold. In 1475 the castle was taken by the Swiss Confederation. In late February 1476, Charles the Bold brought a large mercenary army with him together with many heavy cannons. When the garrison chose to surrender to Charles, they were all executed by hanging or drowning.\\"Panigarola and den Herzog (Galeazzo Maria Sforza) von Orbe,\\" 4 March 1476 as cited in Wilhalm Oechsli ed.

On 2 March 1476 the Swiss army approached the forces of Charles near the town of Concise. They surprised Charles' army and routed them in a short battle. While very few of Charles' soldiers were killed, the Swiss had humiliated the greatest duke in Europe, defeated one of the most feared armies, and taken a most impressive amount of treasure. What is probably a small surviving part of this fantastic booty is on display in various Swiss museums today, whilst a few remaining artillery pieces can be seen in the museum of La Neuveville, near Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland.Florens Deuchler, Die Burgunderbeute, q.v. The castle was used as a seat of the bailiff until 1798 and then went over to the private sector. Today the Ch√¢teau de Grandson survives as one of the best-preserved medieval fortresses in Switzerland. Only the dungeon has disappeared, probably destroyed during the construction of the castle's western section. Traces of the dungeon-tower can still be picked out on the northern side. In 1875, the level of Lake Neuch√¢tel was lowered as part of a series of projects to reduce flood-risk in the area, so that the ch√¢teau is now some distance from the lake alongside which it was originally sited, and no longer enjoys the \\"natural protection\\" on its south- eastern side which the lake once afforded.

While not originally defined as a theory of personality, the RST has been used to study and predict anxiety, impulsivity, and extraversion. The theory evolved from Gray's biopsychological theory of personality to incorporate findings from a number of areas in psychology and neuroscience, culminating in a major revision in 2000.Gray, J.A. and McNaughton, N., The Neuropsychology of Anxiety: An Enquiry into the Functions of the Septo- Hippocampal System, July 2003, (Oxford: Oxford University Press), and The revised theory distinguishes between fear and anxiety and proposes functionally related subsystems. Measures of RST have not been widely adapted to reflect the revised theory due to disagreement over related versus independent subsystems. Despite this controversy, RST informed the study of anxiety disorders in clinical settings and continues to be used today to study and predict work performance. RST, a continuously evolving paradigm, is the subject of multiple areas of contemporary psychological enquiry.Corr, P.J., The Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory of Personality, April 2008, (Cambridge: Cambridge University), Origins and evolution of the theory Gray's biopsychological theory of personality was informed by his earlier studies with Mowrer on reward, punishment, and motivation and Hans Eysenck‚Äôs study of the biology of personality traits. Eysenck linked Extraversion to activation of the Ascending Reticular Activation System (ARAS), an area of the brain which regulates sleep and arousal transitions. Eysenck's two original personality factors, Neuroticism and Extraversion, were derived from the same lexical paradigm used by other researchers (e.g., Gordon Allport, Raymond Cattell) to delineate the structure of personality. Eysenck‚Äôs Extraversion- Arousal Hypothesis states that under low stimulation conditions, introverts (defined as low in Extraversion) will be more highly aroused than extraverts; however, under high stimulation, introverts may become over-aroused, which will feedback within the ARAS and result in decreases in arousal. Alternatively, extraverts tend to show greater increases in arousal under high stimulation. Eysenck also studied the relationship between neuroticism and activation of the limbic system using classical emotional conditioning models. His theory focused more on anxiety as a disorder than a personality trait. Eysenck‚Äôs theory predicts that introverts are more likely to develop anxiety disorders because they show higher neuroticism and stronger emotional conditioning responses under high arousal. His theory was criticized because introverts often show the opposite pattern, weaker classical conditioning under high arousal, and some supporting data confounded personality traits with time of day. =Gray's biopsychological theory: behavioral activation and inhibition systems= Unlike Eysenck, Gray believed that personality traits and disorders could not be explained by classical conditioning alone. Gray proposed the Biopsychological Theory of personality in 1970 based on extensive animal research.Larsen, R. J., & Buss, D. M. (2009). Personality Psychology: Domains of Knowledge about Human Nature. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill. His theory emphasized the relationship between personality and sensitivity to reinforcement (i.e. reward and punishment). Eysenck‚Äôs theory emphasized Extraversion, Neuroticism, and arousal, while Gray‚Äôs theory emphasized Impulsivity, Anxiety, approach motivation, and avoidance motivation. Gray's model of personality was based on three hypothesized brain systems: Behavioral activation system (BAS) *The BAS includes brain regions involved in regulating arousal: cerebral cortex, thalamus, and striatum.De Pascalis, V., Fiore, A., Sparita, A. (1996). Personality, event-related potential (ERP) and heart rate (HR): An investigation of Gray's theory. Personality and Individual Differences, 20, 733-746. The system is responsive to conditioned and unconditioned reward cues. BAS regulates approach behaviors and is referred to as the reward system. In general, individuals with a more active BAS tend to be more impulsive and may have difficulty inhibiting their behavior when approaching a goal.Gray, J. A. (1991). The neurophysiology of temperament. In J. Strelau & A. Angleitner (Eds.), Explorations in temperament: International perspectives on theory and measurement (pp. 105-128). New York, NY: Plenum. Behavioral inhibition system (BIS) *The BIS also includes brain regions involved in regulating arousal: the brain stem, and neocortical projections to the frontal lobe. BIS is responsive to punishment, novelty, uncertainty, and non-rewarding stimuli. BIS regulates avoidance behaviors and is often referred to as the punishment system. Individuals with more active BIS may be vulnerable to negative emotions, including frustration, anxiety, fear, and sadness. Fight/flight system (FFS) *The FFS mediates reactions of rage and panic, flight versus fight, and is sensitive to unconditioned aversive stimuli. FFS is often referred to as the threat system. According to Gray, personality traits are associated with individual differences in the strengths of BAS (approach motivation) and BIS (avoidance motivation) systems. As it is defined for the remainder of the article, higher BAS/BIS refers to greater activation of that system.Zelenski, J. M., & Larsen, J. R. (1999). Susceptibility to affect: A comparison of three personality taxonomies. Journal of Personality, 67, 761-791. =Measures= High BAS is generally associated with high extraversion, low neuroticism, and trait impulsivity, while high BIS is associated with low extraversion, high neuroticism, and trait anxiety. In addition to predicting trait standings, high BAS is associated with higher positive affect in response to reward, while high BIS is associated with higher negative affect in response to punishment. Studies in Gray‚Äôs laboratory supported his prediction that extraverts, higher in BAS and lower in BIS than introverts, are more sensitive to rewards, experience higher levels of positive affect, and learn faster under rewarding conditions. The most widely used measures of the approach (BAS) and avoidance (BIS) systems are the BIS/BAS scales developed by Carver and White in 1994. The Generalized Reward and Punishment Expectancies Scales (GRAPES) were also used to operationalize BIS and BAS. Both self-report measures (listed above) and behavioral measures (such as affective modulation of the eyeblink startle response) have been used to test predictions and provide mixed support for Gray‚Äôs theory. =Critique= These measures were constructed under the assumption that BIS, BAS and associated traits Anxiety and Impulsivity are independent. In contrast, Gray first described BIS and BAS as opposing systems with bidirectional inhibitory links in animal models. Thus, empirical results that claimed to falsify the theory may have relied on faulty predictions for independent, non-interacting systems. Gray‚Äôs theory was also criticized because the boundary between FFS (threat response system) and BIS (punishment system) was difficult to define empirically, akin to differentiating between fear and anxiety. Matthews and Gilliland proposed separate cognitive systems underlying fear and anxiety and emphasized the need to study these systems outside of animal models. These critiques led to a major revision and renaming of the theory in 2000. The Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (RST) redefined the three systems underlying anxiety, impulsivity, motivation, and reinforcement learning. Reinforcement sensitivity theory Reinforcement sensitivity theory is one of the major biological models of individual differences in emotion, motivation, and learning. The theory distinguishes between fear and anxiety, and links reinforcement processes to personality. Behavioral activation system (BAS) *Proposed to facilitate reactions to all appetitive/rewarding stimuli and regulates approach behavior. Behavioral inhibition system (BIS) *Proposed to mediate conflict both within and between FFFS and BAS: FFFS (avoidance) and BAS (approach) (or BAS-BAS, FFFS-FFFS). These conflicts underlie anxiety. Fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) *Proposed to mediate reactions to all aversive/ punishing stimuli (conditioned and unconditioned), regulates avoidance behavior, and underlies fear. =Improved measures= The fight-flight-freeze system (FFFS) was expanded to include all aversive/punishment stimuli, conditioned and unconditioned. Similarly, the Behavioral Activation System (BAS) was expanded to include all appetitive/reward stimuli. The Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) was defined as a conflict system activated whenever both BAS and FFFS are activated together or multiple inputs compete within the systems, thereby producing anxiety. If the systems are assumed to be functionally related, the effect of a given stimulus is dependent upon the strength of that stimulus, reactivity in the activated system, and strength of the competing system. Thus, for a reward, the behavior output from BAS is dependent on the strength of the reward, activation of the BAS, and inhibition strength of BIS. For example, if a reward outweighs a threat, the BIS should excite the BAS and inhibit the FFFS, which will likely result in approach behavior. The new RST distinguishes the subsystems underlying anxiety and fear. The FFFS is associated with fear and the BIS is associated with anxiety. This distinction is still debated, especially in clinical settings wherein BIS scores are sensitive to fear/panic-reducing, not anxiety-reducing treatments. Furthermore, the possibility of anxiety's triggering panic and vice versa supports a model of the BIS and the FFFS in which the two are not causally independent. Conflicting results regarding the relationship between fear and anxiety may reflect measures which were not updated to reflect the functionally dependent systems of the new RST. A review by Perkins and Corr (2006) found that the BIS as measured in Carver, 1994 scales and similar constructs tap into the FFFS (which fear responses) and not the true BIS (which underlies anxiety). These definitions were not updated to reflect the revised RST model. D.C. Blanchard and colleagues (2001) created vignettes with response options that modeled rodent reactions to anxiety (the BIS, used ambiguous/partially threatening stimuli) and fear (the FFFS, used pure threat situations) to study these constructs in humans. These behavioroid scales ask: \\"What would you do if (insert scenario inducing fear or anxiety)?\\" Response options accurately reflect the revised RST, but have not been widely tested or applied. =Separable and joint subsystems hypotheses= The revised RST reflects functional dependence of the systems; however, there are two competing hypotheses developed for testing RST predictions. The separable systems hypothesis (SSH) is defined by two independent systems, reward and punishment. Independence implies that reactivity to rewards should be approximately equal across all levels of punishment, and reactivity to punishment should be equal across all levels of reward. Thus, rewarding stimuli may activate the BAS, without exerting effects on the BIS or the FFFS. The SSH is proposed to operate in extreme circumstances, within individuals with highly reactive systems and/or experimental conditions that only present rewarding or punishing stimuli. The separable subsystems hypothesis has been applied successfully to study reinforcement learning and motivation in clinical populations. Alternatively, the joint subsystems hypothesis (JSH), in accordance with Gray‚Äôs original animal models and the revised RST, states that reward and punishment exert combined effects in the BAS and the FFFS, while the BIS resolves conflict within and between the systems. The reward and punishment systems are defined as dependent, such that reward activation (the BAS) both increases responses to appetitive stimuli and decreases responses to aversive stimuli. The joint subsystems hypothesis is most applicable in real- world contexts that contain mixed stimuli: strong, weak, punishment, and reward. In a recent review on RST measurement, authors distinguished between dependent system inputs and dependent behavioral outputs. The BAS, FFFS, and BIS are dependent systems (and current research attempts to define under what task situations and to what degree they interact). A rewarding stimulus may activate all three systems to some extent such that high scores on a BAS- related behavioral trait, for example, may include high BAS, low FFFS, and low BIS activations. Corr and colleagues tested separate and joint subsystems predictions against each other. Their results support the joint subsystems hypothesis: high anxiety individuals reacted more strongly to punishment cues, and this effect was stronger in jointly low impulsive, high anxiety individuals. Pickering used regression and neural network models to show that patterns of inputs from the BAS and the BIS/FFFS generate a large range of outcomes that support the JSH (all three system activations were needed to determine best fit for behavioral output). There is now pharmacological evidence to support dependence of these systems, notably serotonergic (5-HT) modulation of the dopamine pathway. As mentioned previously, these complex, dependent systems are not reflected in questionnaires, such as Carver‚Äôs BIS/BAS, that are oftentimes used to test RST predictions. A variety of disparate experimental findings, originally viewed as inconsistent with Gray‚Äôs Biopsychological theory, are more consistent with RST joint systems hypothesis. =Renaming impulsivity= Smillie, Pickering, and Jackson (2006) advocated for renaming trait Impulsivity, which is associated with BAS in the revised RST, Extraversion. Empirical tests find that Extraversion is a better predictor than Impulsivity of reward learning. Some components of the BAS and reward learning are better explained by association with Extraversion, especially high positive affect, while the cortical arousal loop originally proposed to underlie BAS in Gray's theory is still tied most closely with Impulsivity. Regardless of the trait label, the authors point out that the RST did not develop as a theory to explain the personality constructs, Anxiety and Impulsivity. Rather, the RST predicts associations between reinforcement sensitivity, motivation, and behavior. Applications =Workplace performance= Carver and White's 1994 BIS/BAS scales were used to support the finding that employees high in BIS (avoidance motivation) show lower work performance and engagement, while employees high in BAS (approach motivation) show higher performance in rewarding situations only. These measures are not based on the revised RST, and may confound fear and anxiety. Alternatively, the Jackson 5 has recently been validated as a measure of the revised RST and shows convergent validity with measures of fear and anxiety. The proposed fear (FFFS) subscale is associated with avoidance behaviors (example item: 'If approached by a suspicious stranger, I run away') while the anxiety (BIS) subscale includes social situations wherein reward and punishment stimuli result in conflict between approach and avoidance motivations (example item: 'I prefer to work on projects where I can prove my abilities to others'). Clark and Loxton (2011) used the Jackson 5 to investigate mediators between fear, psychological acceptance, and work engagement. Self-reported fear, not anxiety, best predicted psychological acceptance, and lower work performance in turn. Thus, current research aims to apply measures based on the revised RST to more accurately clarify relations between fear, anxiety, and job performance. =Clinical research= The BIS and BAS sensitivities are associated with individual differences in positive and negative affect. This association has been largely explored in clinical populations exhibiting extreme scores on BIS/BAS measures. In their 2009 review, Bijttebier and colleagues summarized studies showing that high BIS sensitivity is present in individuals with anxiety, depression, and anorexia nervosa, whereas low BIS sensitivity is associated with psychopathy. Extremely high BAS sensitivity is characteristic of individuals with bipolar disorder, ADHD, and bulimia, while extremely low BAS often characterizes individuals with anhedonic depression. BIS and BAS may differentiate, as illustrated above, between sub-types of eating disorders and depression. These findings are correlational, and causal mechanisms were not directly tested. Researchers in fields ranging from cognitive science to self-regulation and attention are using the RST to investigate causal mechanisms that underlie the relationship between personality traits and psychopathology.

In 1975, photojournalist Hubert van Es, working for UPI, captured an iconic photo of U.S government employees evacuating the city by helicopter during the Fall of Saigon, the last major battle of the Vietnam War. The evacuation was code named Operation Frequent Wind. The image was widely misreported as showing Americans crowding on to the roof of the United States Embassy to board a helicopter. In reality, the apartment complex, called the Pittman Apartments, housed employees of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with its top floor reserved for the Central Intelligence Agency's deputy chief of station; the embassy was located at 4 Th·ªëng Nh·∫•t, about to the south-southeast. The photo depicts an Air America Huey helicopter landing on the roof of the elevator shaft to evacuate employees of the U.S. government as North Vietnamese Army troops entered Saigon. At the end of the war, Saigon was renamed Ho Chi Minh City, and Gia Long Street was renamed L√Ω T·ª± Tr·ªçng Street, in honor of a 17-year-old communist executed by the French.

History Kaplan grew up in Dix Hills, Long Island around the corner from the landmark John Coltrane House. He studied philosophy, writing, and literature at The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and at UCLA. He then trained in acting, improvisation, and writing with Scott Bernstein in Los Angeles. Randy's theater credits include Spring Awakening, Fifty Minutes, and The Fresca Wars. He has also acted in films (Never Say Goodbye, Missing Parents) and on television shows such as Beauty and the Beast, Growing Pains, A Different World, and the short-lived Ferris Beuller. Kaplan fronted the band ‚Äúi‚Äù in Los Angeles for several years in the early 1990s. They performed at LA clubs such as The Troubadour, The Whisky-A-Go-Go, and The Roxy and at many other venues on the West Coast and in the Southwest sharing bills with bands and performers such as The Mother Hips, Chuck E. Weiss, Eleni Mandell, Dan Bern, and Andras Jones and the Previous. In 1993 Randy moved to New York City. He lived and worked on the Lower East Side and performed at venues such as Sin-√©, The Living Room, and The Bottom Line. He released his first CD, Boyish Hips, in 1997. He has toured extensively throughout the US, appearing at clubs, cafes, bars, and roadhouses in more than thirty states. Randy has lived in New York, California, Kansas, and Michigan. Kaplan has had his poetry published by Ugly Duckling Presse and The Missing Slateurl=http://themissingslate.com/2014/12/28/eryngoes-can-make-you- go/  and has received several ASCAP awards for his work. He began his Children's Music career in Park Slope, Brooklyn in 2005, working at Beansprouts preschool and performing weekly concerts at Perch Cafe. Randy collaborated with Brian & Erin Schey on CLEAVE, a musical comedy that was staged at The Boulder International Fringe Festival in Colorado in 2008 and in which Randy co-starred. Randy lives in a Detroit suburb with his wife and son. Work In his songs for children and their families, Randy Kaplan blends American Roots, Country Blues, and Comedic Storytelling. He fingerpicks his way through unpredictable, sold out, live shows, which in addition to his original compositions include Broadway numbers, Delta Blues songs, and Ragtime tunes. ‚ÄúHe doesn‚Äôt dumb it down for the kids....He just expects them to come along for the ride. And they do,‚Äù says Time Out New York Kids. Randy plans to record his sixth not-JUST-for-kids CD in August 2016. Randy's work has been awarded top honors from NAPPA (National Parenting Publication Awards), been voted a Top Five CD in the Nickelodeon Parents' Picks Awards, been featured prominently in children's magazines and on family websites, and has appeared on the Top Ten lists of NPR, People magazine, Time Out New York Kids, Fids & Kamily, Zooglobble, OWTK, Family Man Online (where it was also awarded the #1 spot), and many others.

It features all-time classics like \\"Over the Rainbow\\", \\"Kids\\" (from Bye Bye Birdie), and \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" (a good first mantra for children) as well as original songs like \\"Shampoo Me\\" (the account of the friendly but demanding shark in the bathtub), \\"Mosquito Song\\", and \\"Roaches\\" (they're tryin' on your underwear, checkin' out your grocery list, readin' your copy of Metamorphosis). Randy's Not-REALLY-For-Kids CDs: SONGS FOR OLD LOVERS (2011) is a true concept album which pays tribute to some of the earliest concept albums in American pop music history. Randy's original compositions are responses to songs from the 1930s and 40s, standards recorded by the likes of Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Chet Baker, and Nat King Cole. There are nods to the songwriting styles of the day throughout, both harmonically and lyrically. (adapted from the liner notes by Montague Z. Young) DURANGO (2008), a collection of 11 songs Randy co-wrote with Brian Schey over the past two decades, was released in November 2008. The record is bookended by two jazz/pop piano-based songs, the title track and \\"No Matter What\\" (which also appeared on the CD REBORN AS BEES in 1999). There are also skewed rock anthems, Mexican surf numbers, and cabaret-influenced ballads. Brian Schey is an accomplished composer, arranger, and producer who has toured the US and Europe as a bassist with, among others, Dan Bern and Great American Taxi. Randy and Brian have worked together in many styles, from rock to jazz to musical theater. Brian's latest project is RUE, a gypsy-jazz-influenced band he formed with Erin Schey. ANCIENT RUINS (2008) contains several bluegrass numbers - fiddle, banjo, guitar, upright bass and all- but there's also the trademark Kaplan unorthodox ballads and curiously anthemic rock songs. Along with his ten originals, Kaplan covers Nirvana's \\"On a Plain,\\" Prince's \\"I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man,\\" and Grandmaster Flash's \\"The Message\\" (transforming this old school rap classic into a bluegrass barnburner). For his CD PERFECT GENTLEMAN (2004) Randy amassed a collection of cheap yard-sale organs. He used their built-in drum samples to create rhythm tracks; he then utilized these rock, jazz, waltz, swing, bossa nova, dixie, cha-cha, and rhumba beats to fashion songs ranging from simply-structured folk and country ballads to torch songs, lampoons, spirituals, and satires. By editing, manipulating, and overlapping the beats from these various 1970s organs Randy transformed the crude and kitschy samples into more polished and developed sounds. At times, though, he just placed a sound 'as is' into a new context. The characters who inhabit these songs often seek to gain mastery over their chronic pathologies, or at least to acknowledge them. These characters include an anti-prophet who asks only that he be given as big a funeral as Jesus and Moses, an overweight middle-aged man who carries around a picture of his shirtless teen-aged self in order to lure women, and the ghosts of Edith Wharton and Alexander Hamilton. MIRACULOUS DISSOLVING CURES (2001) is a musically rich collection of threnodies and noiresque tales that find Kaplan battling the forces of love and loss as well as the hypocrisy of both the secular and religious worlds. Stylistically, the record ranges from the quasi- Latin beat of \\"Crushed Berries\\" to the hint of electronica in \\"The Girl Who's Done It All\\" to the irresistible mix of synthesizer and Spanish guitar throughout \\"Unpaid Bills.\\" There's also a full-color 12-page CD booklet featuring abstract paintings (by Yasmina Palumbo, Leila Hamilton, Masha Solomon, Lucille Dreyblatt, and others) juxtaposed to the words for each song. MDC was recorded by Colin Mahoney in Lawrence, Kansas. In 1999 Randy released two albums simultaneously, REBORN AS BEES and LAKE CHAMPIONS. Both were recorded at Z'gwon, th Studios in Lawrence, Kansas by Colin Mahoney, who also played drums. BEES was created as a tribute to Randy's father, who died in an automobile accident in the summer of 1997, and as an investigation of grief and hope. It is an eloquently dark and sometimes angry record but it is also universal in its hard-driving and melodic psychological study of loss, unfulfilled love, and the struggle to find second chances. REBORN AS BEES, whose title comes from a Chasidic saying via Martin Buber, is a true concept album. LAKE CHAMPIONS was recorded during the REBORN AS BEES sessions and features Randy, his guitar, voice, and harmonica only. This eclectic record has just about everything: torch songs, ballads, and tales; hope, love, and despair. LAKE CHAMPIONS is a personal and intimate album that touches on all the trademark Kaplan subjects. In early 1997, Randy recorded BOYISH HIPS at his friend Scott Bernstein's Hollywood apartment on his Tascam 4-track cassette recorder. On the record, his first CD, Randy used guitar, harmonica, piano, Fender Rhodes, and pots & pans as percussion instruments to orchestrate a joyful, Caribbeanesque sound. This deceptively light collection of songs includes \\"Slow Eater,\\" in which a man denies being a binger and instead blames others for eating too slowly and too sparsely. In \\"Everyone I See,\\" a man employs skewed logic to defend his inability to commit himself to one woman. In \\"Ten Page Letter,\\" a woman demands \\"action not words\\" from a man who can do nothing about his feelings but express them in letters. \\"Send For Our Stuff\\" is both a love song and a tribute to the naive beauty of Los Angeles. This experimental album is full of lyrical and emotional minefields and fraught with neurotic wit, unbridled perplexity, and desperate passions.

Blunt averaged 6.5 points for the Evansville Thunder in the Continental league, and also played briefly for the Dijon team in France. In 1986, Blunt ranked second in scoring in the English league, hitting a 30.1 clip for the Calderdale Explorers.

It is supervised by the Federal Ministry of Finance. The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) is privately owned and self-regulating, but the SEC maintains surveillance over it with the mandate of ensuring orderly and equitable dealings in securities, and protecting the market against insider trading abuses. Formation and early years The Commission originates from the ad hoc, non-statutory Capital Issues Committee established in 1962 as an arm of the Central Bank of Nigeria. The committee became the Security Exchange Commission in 1973, and then the Securities and Exchange Commission was chartered with SEC Decree No. 71 of 1979. The commission is now chartered by the Investments and Securities Act No 45 of 1999. A second-tier securities market was established in 1985, and the market grew as the government followed a program of privatization of public sector enterprises. With market capitalization of N4.46 billion in 1980, by the end of 1997 the Nigerian securities market had a market capitalization of N281.8 billion. The market appeared to be operating efficiently, although it was depressed by low personal incomes in Nigeria and political instability deterring foreign direct investment. 2000-2010 capital market boom and bust During the first half of the 2000s, the Central Bank of Nigeria instituted reforms that led to a reduction in the number of banks but a great increase in their size. This and other factors led to a surge in equity market capitalization on the NSE, peaking in March 2008 at US$100 billion, over 60% of which was owned by the banks. When Musa Al-Faki, a stockbroker, was installed Director General in 2004, many thought his appointment had been engineered by Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke, head of the Nigerian Stock Exchange. If so, this may have undermined the authority of the SEC as a supervisor during a period of rampant speculation. The global financial crisis that began in 2008 caused a severe crisis among Nigerian banks, with several forced to close. After the Central Bank had audited the banks in 2009, the SEC started legal proceedings at the Investments and Securities Tribunal against about 260 individuals and entities, alleging that they were involved in abuse such as insider dealing and share price manipulation. The commission also instituted various reforms including improving regulations so as to encourage development of the bond market, promoting collective investment schemes and reviewing the 2003 Corporate Governance Code. SEC Director General Al-Faki resigned in April 2009 amid criticism of the SEC role in a share-manipulation scandal involving the African Petroleum stock. He was eventually replaced by Arunma Oteh, who became Director General in January 2010. In August 2010 Oteh dismissed Okereke-Onyiuke from the stock exchange. The President of the Stock Exchange, Alhaji Aliko Dangote, was also dismissed. In September 2010 it was reported that the SEC was considering converting the stock exchange to a private company rather than a mutually owned enterprise. The SEC said its actions were due to problems at the stock exchange that included \\"inadequate oversight...ongoing litigation, allegations of financial mismanagement, governance challenges\\".

The sole example of the PG-130 was registered with the US Federal Aviation Administration as an Experimental - Amateur-built. Operational history Soaring Magazine reported in 1983 that Perl still owned the aircraft and was flying it at that time.

In this capacity, he played a major role in diplomacy between the United States and the Soviet Union during the beginning of the John F. Kennedy administration. President Kennedy‚Äôs brother, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, secretly met with Bolshakov on numerous occasions in 1961 in order to gain more information about Soviet intentions and convey messages from the administration to the top Soviet leadership, including Premier Nikita Khrushchev. Bolshakov was thus a vital back-channel contact between the American and Soviet governments. The Kennedy administration used him to set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961 and, even more importantly, to defuse and resolve the Berlin Crisis in October of that year. Historians have implied that the Soviets benefited more from this exchange, as Bolshakov was not told the full scope and intentions of the Soviet leadership, while the US communicated its worries and concerns more completely and transparently. A more precise evaluation of the level and impact of Bolshakov‚Äôs role in US-Soviet diplomacy awaits further release of archival records.

Customer value is defined as Value = Benefits - Price. Thus, customer benefits are quantified in a CVM - product features and capabilities are translated into dollars. Customer value models are different from customer lifetime value models, which seek to quantify the value of a customer to its suppliers. Firms using customer value models Many firms have been reported to use customer value models,Anderson, James C; Narus, James A; and van Rossum, Wouter, (2006), \\"Customer Value Propositions in Business Markets\\", Harvard Business Review, March, p 91-99 including General Electric, Alcoa, W.W. Grainger, Qualcomm, Sonoco, BT Industries Group, Rockwell Automation, and Akzo Nobel. Uses of customer value models #New product and service development and refinement: The dialog and customer immersion that is part of a CVM is used to discover and determine which potential product features and functionality would create the most value for customers. This on-site interaction can be used to frame and define those features and functionality. Often a key is to focus on product or service capabilities rather than on features. Successful CVM efforts change the basis of the customer-supplier product conversation away from features and functions and toward problems, benefits, and value.Lindstedt, Per and Berenius, Jan, (2003), \\"The Value Model: How to Master Product Development and Create Unrivaled Customer Value\\", Nimba Publishers #Sales tools: CVMs can serve as a quantified statement of value and benefits for a customer that is used by the vendor sales staff to both sell into a new account, as well as to reaffirm and validate value created for current customers as a means to retain and grow current customer. CVMs also can help firms to determine the more rational promotion cost. Customer value model methods There are several methods and approaches used to create customer value models. All of these approaches appear to depend on substantial customer interaction and on-site interviews and observations of customers' challenges related to the product or service being valued. The CVMs are of varying complexity. One consulting firm has found it useful to reverse- engineer customer P&Ls; (profit and loss statements) to establish a clear connection between the product benefits and the customer bottom-line.

History The Rothman Index is named in honor of Florence Rothman. In 2003, Florence underwent an operation to replace a heart valve at Sarasota Memorial Hospital. Although her health initially improved after the operation it gradually worsened until she died 10 days after the operation. Her sons Michael and Steven Rothman determined that it was the overall system of care that failed her by not detecting her gradual health deterioration. Their solution was to develop a simple measure of a patient‚Äôs overall condition that can be plotted versus time to show a doctor or a nurse whether a patient is recovering or deteriorating. They worked with Sarasota Memorial Hospital by analyzing thousands of patient records in the Electronic Health Record to develop the Rothman Index.\\"HIStalk Interviews Michael Rothman. 2001-10-25.

The Rothman Index captures data found in a hospital's electronic health record and displays the progression of a patient's health over time. The Rothman Index generates a regularly updated health score synthesizing routine vital signs, nursing assessments, and lab results, for display in a user-friendly graphical format, summarizing thousands of pages of patient data at a glance. The Rothman Index simplifies the tracking of patient progress and detects subtle declines in health.

The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross was awarded to recognise extreme battlefield bravery or successful military leadership. Career Feldwebel Schentke served with 9./JG 3 from March 1940. He participated in the Battle of France, where he earned his first victory. Schentke also served during the Battle of Britain claiming 3 more victories. He next took part in Operation Barbarossa, during 1941, flying wingman to Major Walter Oesau, who was his Gruppenkommandeur of III./JG 3. After 34 victories, Oberfeldwebel Schentke received the Ritterkreuz on 4 September 1941. From November, over the winter, III./JG 3 was rotated from the front for recuperation, and including a short stint in Italy in January. Schentke briefly transferred to 2./JG 3 and flew escort missions for the transport planes flying in supplies to the Demyansk pocket. He then returned to 9./JG 3 and continued to score regularly. In late July 1942, after 71 confirmed victories, Schentke was transferred to Erg√§nzungsgruppe S√ºd as an instructor, promoted to Leutnant and awarded the German Cross in Gold. He returned to the Eastern Front in November 1942, joining 2./JG 3. Schentke was part of the volunteer Platzschutzstaffel (Airfield Defence squadron) Pitomnik. Their job was to defend the besieged 6th Army airfields near Stalingrad and protect the vulnerable transports on the last leg of their flights into the pocket. Over 6 weeks, in heavy snows and fogs and often with only 2 or 3 Bf 109's serviceable, this small unit claimed some 130 Soviet aircraft shot down. Schentke himself scored 29 victories including three on 10 December and six on 12 December in 5 missions. On Christmas Day 1942 Schentke shot down a Soviet Il-2 but debris damaged his Bf 109G-2 (Black-3, W.Nr 13885) forcing him to bail out over Soviet positions to the west of the city. That was the last time he was seen alive. He was posthumously promoted to Oberleutnant. During his career he was credited with 90 aerial victories, 4 over the Western Front and 86 over the Eastern Front, including at least 15 Il-2 Sturmoviks.

Since February 2017, it has been owned by the German company Cliqz International GmbH (formerly owned by Evidon, Inc., which was previously called Ghostery, Inc. and the Better Advertising Project). The code was originally developed by David Cancel and associates. Ghostery enables its users to detect and control JavaScript \\"tags\\" and \\"trackers\\" in order to remove JavaScript bugs and beacons that are embedded in many web pages which allow for the collection of a user's browsing habits via HTTP cookies, as well as participating in more sophisticated forms of tracking such as canvas fingerprinting. As of 2017, Ghostery is available for Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, Opera, Safari, iOS, Android, and Firefox for Android. Additionally, Ghostery's privacy team creates profiles of page elements and companies for educational purposes. Functionality =Blocking= Ghostery blocks HTTP requests and redirects according to their source address in several ways: # Blocking third- party tracking scripts that are used by websites to collect data on user behavior for advertising, marketing, site optimization, and security purposes. These scripts, also known as \\"tags\\" or \\"trackers\\", are the underlying technology that places tracking cookies on consumers' browsers. # Continuously curating a \\"script library\\" that identifies when new tracking scripts are encountered on the Internet and automatically blocking them. # Creating \\"Whitelists\\" of websites where third-party script blocking is disabled and other advanced functionality for users to configure and personalize their experience. When a tracker is blocked, any cookie that the tracker has placed is not accessible to anyone but the user and thus cannot be read when called upon. =Reporting= Ghostery reports all tracking packages detected, and whether Ghostery has blocked them or not, in a \\"findings window\\" accessible from clicking on the Ghostery Icon in the browser. When configured, Ghostery also displays the list of trackers present on the page in a temporary purple overlay box. History and use Originally developed by David Cancel, Ghostery was acquired by Evidon (renamed Ghostery, Inc.) in January 2010. Ghostery is among the most popular browser extensions for privacy protection. In 2014, Edward Snowden suggested consumers use Ghostery along with other tools to protect their online privacy. Ghostery, Inc. made their software source code open for review in 2010, but did not release further versions of the source code after that. On February 22, 2016, the company released the EULA for the Ghostery browser extension, as a proprietary closed-source product. Cliqz GmbH acquired Ghostery from Evidon Inc. in February 2017. Cliqz is a German company majority-owned by Hubert Burda Media. Ghostery no longer shares data of any kind with Evidon. On March 8, 2018, Ghostery shifted back to an open source development model and published their source code on GitHub, saying that this would allow third-party contributions as well as make the software more transparent in its operations. The company said that Evidon's business model \\"was hard to understand and lent itself to conspiracy theories\\", and that its new monetization strategy would involve affiliate marketing and the sale of ad analytics data. In May 2018, in the distribution of an email promoting changes to Ghostery's practices to comply with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), hundreds of user email addresses were accidentally leaked by listing them as recipients. Ghostery apologized for the incident, stating that they stopped the distribution of the email when they noticed the error, and reported that this was caused by a new in-house email system that accidentally sent the message as a single email to many recipients, rather than sending it individually to each user. Criticism Under its former owner Evidon, Ghostery had an opt-in feature called GhostRank. GhostRank could be enabled to \\"support\\" its privacy function. GhostRank took note of ads encountered and blocked, then sent that information back to advertisers so they could better formulate their ads to avoid being blocked. Though Ghostery claims that the data is anonymized, patterns of web page visits cannot truly be anonymized. Not everyone sees Evidon's business model as conflict-free. Jonathan Mayer, a Stanford graduate student and privacy advocate, has said: \\"Evidon has a financial incentive to encourage the program's adoption and discourage alternatives like Do Not Track and cookie blocking as well as to maintain positive relationships with intrusive advertising companies\\". Since July 2018, with version 8.2, Ghostery shows advertisements of its own to users. Burda claims that the advertisements do not send personal data back to their servers and that they do not create a personal profile.

After construction of the Morrison Bridge over the Willamette River in the late 19th century, Belmont Street became an important arterial with a streetcar line extending from central downtown Portland to as far east as Southeast 34th Avenue. A business district that centered on the original streetcar terminus gradually spread up and down Belmont. Among the last of the buildings in this development was the Genoa Building. Home to three separate storefronts facing Belmont Street, the Genoa is a square building on each side. Although all are deep, two of the storefronts are wide, and the third, on the west, is only wide. Early tenants included a pharmacist, a barber, and a grocer. Significant architectural features include display windows across the north side and part of the east side of the building, interior ceiling heights, a partial basement in the rear, and a red clay tile roof. J.W. Wilson was the original owner of the building, constructed by Knott and Rogers. Winifred Guild acquired the property in 1943, and the Guild family retained control of it until 1971, after which it was converted to restaurant space.

A legal object is an entity which the law does not thus recognise, because it cannot legally interact; it is merely something in respect of which a legal subject may hold rights, duties and capacities.Kruger & Skelton 13. There are widely agreed to be four kinds of subjective rights and four corresponding legal objects over which a legal subject exercises said rights: * Patrimonial rights: ** Real right: a legal subject exercises a real right (ius in rem)Heaton 3. in respect of movable and immovable things, corporeal or incorporeal, which are of value and susceptible of control.Kruger & Skelton 13. ** Personal right: a legal subject exercises a personal right (ius in personam) in respect of a performance, i.e. ‚Äòan act by which something is given (dare), done (facere) or not done (non facere)‚Äô, such as defrayment or delivery.Kruger & Skelton 13. * Extra-patrimonial rights: ** Immaterial property right: a legal subject exercises a right in respect of immaterial property, i.e. an idea, product or thought process of the human mind,Kruger & Skelton 13: ‚ÄòIt is important to note that the object of this right is not the tangible painting, book or invention itself, but the product of the human intellect. It is thus the idea or thought process contained in the product and not the product itself that is the object of the right.‚Äô such as intellectual property (copyright, patent or trademark), confidential information, trade secrets, biotechnological products, traditional knowledge or participatory claims.Mikhalien Kellerman, The Constitutional Property Clause and Immaterial Property Interests, Dissertation (Stellenbosch University, March 2011), 49‚Äì100. ** Personality right: a legal subject exercises a personality right in respect of an aspect of one's own personality, like one's bodily integrity (corpus), reputation (fama), or human dignity (dignitas).Heaton 4.Kruger & Skelton 13.Davel & Jordaan 2. Similarly, there are two kinds of legal subject: natural and juristic. = Natural and juristic persons = Every human being, for the purposes of South African law, is recognised as a person, but not every legal person is a human being. The distinction is best understood with reference to the two classes of person recognised by the law: namely, natural and juristic. (Only these two have legal personality. Animals and deceased people are excluded.)  Natural persons  Although in 21st-century South Africa every human enjoys non- derogable status as a legal subject,Kruger & Skelton 13. this has not always and everywhere been the case. In Roman and Early Germanic law, for example, slaves had no legal rights or duties or capacities, and were treated merely as legal objects; as property, in other words.Hahlo & Kahn 103. Slavery existed in the Cape, under both Dutch and British rule, until abolition in 1834.Kruger & Skelton 16. Under Roman law, the legal subjectivity of prisoners of war was also usually revoked, while children born with severe deformities‚Äîthey were known as monstra‚Äîcould be killed with the permission of a magistrate.Kruger & Skelton 17.In an obiter dictum in 1949, the Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed that the Roman provisions for severely deformed persons had never formed part of South African common law: ‚ÄòReference or lip service to a vague and nebulous notion is not enough to establish it as a rule of law‚Äô (Tjollo Ateljees (Eins) Bpk v Small 865).  Juristic persons  A juristic person is a social entity, a community or an association of people which has an independent right of existence under the law.Davel & Jordaan 4.Heaton 5. It can be ‚Äòthe bearer of judicial capacities and subjective rights,‚Äô and the accompanying legal entitlements and obligations, just like a natural person. Although it is independent of the natural persons who are its members, it acts through them.Kruger & Skelton 17. Three categories of juristic person are recognised. * Associations established in separate legislation: These may be constituted only with governmental permission, usually where the government has an extensive interest in their operation.Heaton 6.Davel & Jordaan 4. EskomElectricity Act. and the South African Broadcasting CorporationBroadcasting Act. are regulated by specific statutes. * Associations incorporated in terms of enabling legislation: These are also controlled by government in the interests of society, but do not require governmental permission, only registration in terms of a general enabling statute, for their creation.Kruger & Skelton 17. Such is the case, generally speaking, for corporationsCompanies Act.Close Corporations Act. and banks.Banks Act.Mutual Banks Act. * Associations which comply with the common- law requirements for the establishment of a juristic person: These association were known as universitates at common law, which requires merely that the association continue to exist irrespective of changes in membership; that it carry rights, duties and capacities distinct from those of its members; and that its object not be the acquisition of gain,Kruger & Skelton 18. in which case it must register as a company.Companies Act s 31.  Beginning of legal subjectivity  Legal subjectivity begins at birth,Kruger & Skelton 22. prior to which the foetus is generally regarded not as a legal person but merely as a part of the mother. It therefore (in general) has no rights or duties or capacities. Determinations as to whether a legitimate or lawful birth has occurred, and hence whether or not the infans has achieved legal subjectivity, can be especially significant for the purposes of the law of succession.Kruger & Skelton 25. The term birth is regulated by two common law requirements.Van der Vyver & Joubert 59. * The delivery must be fully completed; there must be total separation between the body of the mother and that of the infansKruger & Skelton 22. * The child must be or have been alive, and lived independently, after separation. Even if for a short period of time. Kruger & Skelton 25. A stillborn foetus, or one that dies during delivery, is hence not accorded legal subjectivity.Heaton 7. A third requirement, that the child be viable, has occasionally been mooted,Van Zyl and Van der Vyver 385. whereby the foetus must have reached the point in gestation at which it could live (with or without aid) independent of its mother's bloodstream.Kruger & Skelton 23. There are as yet no grounds for this requirement under South African law.Heaton 7‚Äì8.Davel & Jordaan 12.Van der Vyver & Joubert 60‚Äì61. There is also, however, no definitive test for life after birth in South African law. The Criminal Procedure Act includes the following provision: > At criminal proceedings at which an accused is charged with the killing of a > newly-born child, such child shall be deemed to have been born alive if the > child is proved to have breathed, whether or not the child had an > independent circulation, and it shall not be necessary to prove that such > child was, at the time of its death, entirely separated from the body of its > mother.s 239(1). Emphasis added. For the determination of whether or not a child took breath after birth, questions such as whether or not it cried or registered heart activity, and especially the hydrostatic test, are considered.Davel & Jordaan 12.Van der Vyver & Joubert 60. The Births and Deaths Registration Act defines birth as the nativity of a live child (even where such life is fleeting),s 1(i). and requires that all such be registered.s 9. A child is stillborn if ‚Äòit has had at least 26 weeks of intra-uterine existence but showed no sign of life after complete birth.‚Äôs 1(xviii). These considerations were of especial significance for the important case of S v Mshumpa, where it was determined that the definition of murder did not extend to the intentional killing of a foetus.S v Mshumpa at 62. The victim of a killing had to have been born, and born alive, to qualify as a person, and for his or her killing thus to qualify as murder.S v Mshumpa at 53. When, prior to the operation of section 40 of Children's Act, a child was born by artificial fertilisation of a lesbian in a life partnership, it was given either partner's surname or else a double-barrel surname. This was the result of the case of J v Director-General, which found unconstitutional section 5 of the Children's Status Act, which held that a child was only to be regarded under the law as ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô when its birth mother was married. This meant in addition that only the birth mother, and not the life partner, could be registered as a parent. The whole of the Children's Status Act was subsequently repealed by the Children's Act; although section 40 of the latter re-enacted the unamended section 5 of the former, the Civil Union Act had by that stage put civil unions on an equal footing with marriages,s 13. thus resolving the problem.Heaton 9. = Protection of the interests of the unborn child = Although in general, being without legal subjectivity, the foetus has no rights or duties or capacities, there are certain measures in South African law which provide for its protection if it is subsequently born. Aside from some statutory security and a number of common delictual principles, there is, most notably, the nasciturus fiction, which in Roman lawD 1.5.7. read as follows: Nasciturus pro iam nato habetur, quotiens de commodis eius agitur. It provides that, if it be to the advantage of the nasciturus or unborn child, it is deemed for legal purposes already to have been born, and its interests thus are kept open.Kruger & Skelton 23‚Äì24. The fiction was received from Roman into Roman-Dutch law,Voet 1.5.5. where it was a feature especially of the law of succession, and thence into South African law, where it is still operable today.Kruger & Skelton 24.There is some disagreement in academic circles about whether or not the nasciturus fiction constitutes a solid rule. Van de Vyver and Joubert, for instance, together with Van der Merwe, argue that it is a rule; whereas Heaton, Boezaart, Schafer, Spiro, Kruger and Robinson are agreed that it is merely a fiction. There are three requirements in South African common law for the operation of the nasciturus fiction: # The fiction must operate to the advantage of the nasciturus.Voet 1.5.5. The fiction may not be applied if it would be to the disadvantage of the nasciturus, or where only a third party stands to benefit.Van der Vyver & Joubert 62. # The benefit to the nasciturus must accrue after its conception.Inst 3.1.8.Ex parte Boedel Steenkamp. # The nasciturus must ultimately be born alive, in the legal-technical sense outlined above.Voet 1.5.5. In Christian League of Southern Africa v Rall, the court made clear how the fiction was to be applied in practice: > die toepassing van die nasciturus-fiksie nie die ongeborene met enige > regspersoonlikeheid beklee nie. Dit verseker slegs dat voordele wat die > ongebore vrug na geboorte mag toeval in suspenso gehou word tot sy > geboorte‚ÄôChristian League v Rall, 829H-830A. In English, roughly speaking: No legal personality is actually granted to the foetus by deployment of the nasciturus fiction; it remains without legal subjectivity, and does not have a right (to life, for instance) that can be enforced on its behalf.Kruger & Skelton 38. The benefits accruing to it through the fiction are held ‚Äòin suspense‚Äô until it is born, at which point the fiction is no longer, so to speak, fictional.  Succession  The nasciturus fiction derives its importance in South African law primarily from its operation in the law of succession. This subjects has to do with the inheritance of the heirs/beneficiaries that the deceased left behind.  Intestate succession  Intestate succession covers those rules which apply if a deceased person failed to leave behind a legally valid will to determine who would inherit his assets, in which case prospective heirs may only inherit if alive at the time of delatio, when the estate falls open. Were this rule left to stand on its own, and strictly applied, a conceived but unborn child would be unqualified for intestate inheritance.Kruger & Skelton 25‚Äì26. The nasciturus fiction, however, typically operates in just such cases. If, at the time of delatio, the nasciturus has already been conceived, the fiction is applied to keep its interests in abeyance, and the division of the estate is postponed until such time as the nasciturus is born in the legal- technical sense. If the child is eventually born alive, he will share in the estate as if he had already been born at the time of the testator's death.Davel & Jordaan 15.Kruger & Skelton 26.Heaton 12. Delatio must, however, occur after the moment of conception.Kruger & Skelton 26.  Testate succession  Testate succession covers those rules which apply if the deceased left behind a legally valid will to determine who would inherit his assets. The nasciturus fiction was expressly included for the purposes of testate succession, and thus became part of statutory law,Kruger & Skelton 26. in the Wills Act: > any benefit allocated to the children of a person, or to the members of a > class of persons mentioned in the will shall vest in the children of that > person or those members of the class of persons who are alive at the time of > the devolution of the benefit, or who have already been conceived at that > time and who are later born alive.s 2D(1)(c). In other words, all persons are eligible for inheritance in terms of a will who are alive at the time of the devolution of its benefits, or who had been conceived before that time and were later born alive. The testator in this scenario dies prior to the birth of the heir, but after the heir's conception. The Act introduced a rebuttable presumption that the testator wished to benefit not only those children or members of a class of persons who are alive at the time of his death, but also those who have already been conceived and will later be born alive.Kruger & Skelton 26. In Ex Parte Boedel Steenkamp, an important case decided prior to the addition of section 2D(1)(c) to the Wills Act, and often seen as a precursor to the Law of Succession Amendment Act, the court made clear its unwillingness to act to the prejudice of the nasciturus fiction. If the testator desired to preclude its use in the division of his estate, he had to express this intention very clearly.Kruger & Skelton 26‚Äì27.  Wrongful life actions  The role of the nasciturus fiction in wrongful life actions may best be understood with reference to the cases of Stewart v Botha and Friedman v Glicksman.1141B.  Other methods of preserving the interests of the unborn child  Among the other common-law methods available in South Africa for the preservation of the interests of unborn children is their nomination in wills and trust deeds.See, for example, the fideicommissum. Statutory measures for the protection of unborn children may be found in the following legislation: * Immovable Property (Removal or Modification of Restrictions) Act. * General Law Amendment Act. * Administration of Estates Act. = Abortion = Abortion, legal in South Africa, is regulated by the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act.  Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act  Established in 1996 to repeal the Abortion and Sterilisation Act (to the extent that the latter was applicable to abortion), the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act stressed that ‚Äòtermination of pregnancy is not a form of contraception or population control,‚ÄôPreamble. and divided pregnancy into three trimesters. # During the first twelve weeks of gestation, an abortion may be provided ‚Äòon demand‚Äôs 2(1)(a).‚Äîthat is, at the request of the pregnant woman‚ÄòWoman‚Äô is defined in section 1 as ‚Äòany female person of any age.‚Äô‚Äîand may be carried out by a medical practitioner, a registered midwife or a registered nurse with the needful training.s 2(2). # From the thirteenth week to the twentieth, a pregnancy may be terminated only under four conditions.s 2(1)(b). After consultation with the pregnant woman, a medical practitioner must be of the view that ## continuation of the pregnancy would risk injury to the woman's mental or physical health; or ## the risk is substantial that the child would suffer a severe physical or mental abnormality; or ## the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest; or ## continuation of the pregnancy would significantly affect the social or economic circumstances of the woman. # Abortions after the twentieth week of gestation are restricted to three instances.s 2(1)(c). A medical practitioner, after consulting another medical practitioner or a registered midwife or nurse, must be of the view that continued pregnancy ## would endanger the woman's life; orAlthough the ‚Äòor‚Äô is omitted at this point in the Act, this is generally agreed to be an oversight, given that the conjunction is used each time in the preceding s 2(1)(b). ## would result in severe malformation of the foetus; or ## would pose a risk of injury to the foetus.  Constitutional issues  The courts consistently ruled and held, even before the enactment of the Bill of Rights, that a foetus is not a legal subject, and does not therefore have a right to life which can be enforced on its behalf.Christian League v Rall. After the enactment of the Bill of Rights and the Choice on Termination of Pregnancy Act, the entirety of the latter was challenged, with reference to the Bill of Rights, in Christian Lawyers Association of South Africa v Minister of Health. The plaintiffs cited the constitutional guarantee of the right to life,s 11. and argued that, as life begins at conception, any and all abortion was unconstitutional. The defendants raised an exception to the plaintiffs' particulars of claim, and this exception the court upheld: that it did not disclose a cause of action, because the Constitution does not grant legal subjectivity to, and therefore does not confer any rights on, a foetus.Heaton 24. The constitutional standing of abortion in South Africa is even clearer in the section of the Bill of Rights immediately following the right to life: ‚ÄòEveryone has the right to bodily and psychological integrity, which includes the right to make decisions concerning reproduction.‚Äôs 12(2)(a).  End of legal subjectivity  Legal subjectivity is terminated at death, such that the deceased, like the unborn and the unconceived, have no legal rights or duties, and‚Äîobviously‚Äîno capacities. A dead body is thus only a legal object or ‚Äòthing‚Äô, but there are, in the interests of public health and out of respect for the dead and the feelings and sensibilities of relatives, certain protections in South African law. The handling and disposal of human detritus is regulated, for example, and necrophilia is a crime;Criminal Law Amendment Act likewise the violation of a grave.Snyman 445‚Äì446. = Legal requirements for death = There is as yet no general legal definition of death in South African law. Where previously the test for death was met by the irreversible absence of natural heart and lung activity, now there is no precise moment at which death may be said to have occurred; it is a process that may extend over time. In S v Williams, the court went with the ‚Äòtraditional view of the community‚Äô in declaring the deceased to have been legally dead when she stopped breathing and her heart stopped beating. Under the National Health Act, however, ‚Äò‚Äúdeath‚Äù means brain death‚Äô.s 1. The Births and Deaths Registration Act provides no helpful definition. = Registration of death = The registration of deaths in South Africa is governed by the Births and Deaths Registration Act. All deaths must be reported, by anyone present at or aware of them, or directing their funerals, to the Director-General of Home Affairs,s 14(1). or to a person duly authorised by the Director-General,ss 15(1), 17. irrespective of whether the death was due to natural or unnatural causes. The Director-General will then register the death and issue an official death certificate. Where unnatural causes are suspected, the death must additionally be reported, either by the Director-General or by the relevant medical practitioner, to the police.ss 14(3), 14(4), 15(3). = Presumption of death = In South Africa when a person disappears and there is no evidence either way as to whether or not he is still alive.Kruger & Skelton 46. There is no corpse in respect of which a doctor can issue a death certificate, and no-one who can testify that the person is actually dead. In these circumstances a presumption of death may be ordered, in respect either of common law or of statutory provisions. Anyone with an interest in the death of a missing person may apply in this regard to whichever High Court has jurisdiction over the area in which the missing person lived at the time of disappearance,Ex parte Maclean and must convince the court, on a balance of probabilities, that the missing person is dead.Re Beaglehole. Deaths are not presumed lightly, in other words; the court must be confident that the missing person is more likely dead than alive.A court cannot declare someone dead but presume that the person is more likely dead than alive.The circumstances under which the person left under,are also taken into consideration and also the age of the person is taken into consideration.  Common law  Because Roman-Dutch law is so unclear on the period of absence required for a presumption of death, South Africa initially followed the English rule in terms of which the missing person must have been absent for an uninterrupted period of seven years.In re Booysen at 189. This was later replaced, in Re Beaglehole, with the rule that no fixed period of absence is required. Each case is judged on its own merits, and a variety of factors is now considered. Length of absence is one, and often it is decisive, but the court will also take into account the circumstances in which the person disappeared, his age and his health. Ex parte Pieters cited the general rule, established in In re Cuthbert,At 616. that prolonged absence is not enough in itself persuade the court to make a presumption of death, especially where there is absolutely no evidence otherwise to suggest it. There are, of course, exceptions to the rule,In Ex Parte Engelbrecht, the court was inclined to presume death on the basis of Engelbrecht's having been missing for 35 years, and the fact that, were he still alive, he would have been ninety-three years old. Even there, though, a rule nisi was discharged. but for the most part they entail some substitute for the presumption. In Ex parte Pieters, the court issued a rule nisi, declining to presume Pieters death, and authorised the Master to distribute his estate (only around R6,000, which was a factor in the court's considerations) among his children.  Statutory procedure  In addition to the common law on presumption of death, there is the Inquests Act, which provides for circumstances in which there is a suspicion of unnatural causes. If the Magistrate considers someone's death to have been due to unnatural causes, he must hold an inquest.s 5(1). A record of the findings, if they establish the deceased's identity and date of death, must be submitted to the relevant High Court for review.s 18(1). If the High Court confirms the findings, the effect is the same as for a presumption-of-death order.s 18(2).  Effect  It is worth stressing that the effect of the court's order is not to declare that a person is dead but only to make a rebuttable presumption to that effect. Should it transpire that the person is actually alive, a simple application to the relevant court (which may be brought by any interested party, or by the living person himself) will usually suffice to have its order set aside.Heaton 32.Davel & Jordaan 192‚Äì193. The first consequence of an order of presumption of death is that the estate of the missing person is divided, as if he were dead, among his heirs.Kruger & Skelton 51. It is not always required for this, however, that a court be willing to grant a presumption of death; the court also has the option of appointing a curator bonis to administer the missing person's affairs without granting a presumption-of-death order, the precedent for which was established in In re Kannemeyer, where the heirs were required to give security for the inherited estate in the event that the missing person reappeared. A second consequence is that the missing person's life policies are paid out to the beneficiaries, on the condition that cautio de restituendo be provided. A third consequence is on the missing person's marriage, which is not automatically dissolved by a presumption-of-death order. The remarriage of the surviving spouse is regulated by the Dissolution of Marriages on Presumption of Death Act: Should she wish to remarry or enter a new civil union, she must bring an application for a court order dissolving the marriage or civil union of the missing person. The dissolution will take effect from a date determined by the court, and the application may be brought alongside an application for presumption of death, or any time after the presumption is made. The court will not grant the application mero motu‚Äîbut only on application by the spouse or civil partner of the missing person. The necessary implication of a successful application for the dissolution of a marriage or civil union is that it will remain dissolved even if the missing person reappears.Heaton 33.Davel & Jordaan 194.Kruger & Skelton 51.Van der Vyver & Joubert 425.

Notes  Category:South African law ","title":"Law of persons in South Africa"},{"id":"32021760","text":"American Studies (AMSJ) is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal covering issues broadly covering issues broadly concerning American culture, society, as well as international perspectives. The journal is sponsored by the Mid- America American Studies Association and the University of Kansas. In 2005, the journal merged with American Studies International. The editorial staff at the University of Kansas includes: editors-in-chief Sherrie Tucker and Randal Maurice Jelks; associate editor Chris Perreira; assistant editor Bobby Cervantes; managing editor Elizabeth Wilhelm; and media assistant Ashley Aranda. In 2020, American Studies revamped the journal's blog as Dialogues: Blog of the American Studies Journal, edited by Chris Perreira. The American Studies editorial board is made up of 44 members from 38 institutions in 7 countries.  History  American Studies became a major journal in 1959, when it was first known as the Journal of the Central Mississippi Valley American Studies Association and later as the Midcontinent American Studies Journal. Since 1971, it has been called American Studies and has been published by the ASA‚Äôs regional chapter, the Mid-America American Studies Association. In 2005, the triannual journal became a quarterly. A merger with American Studies International (ASI), which ceased publication in 2004, marked a commitment to internationalizing the editorial board and increasing the presence of scholarship produced outside the U.S., as well as a commitment to continue the teaching-focused features that had been sustained by ASI. American Studies is one of the top journals in the field, with a U.S. circulation of roughly 1,200 and an international circulation averaging around 500. The journal is available open-source with a rolling embargo of 3 years and is available full- text through the following databases: JSTOR, Project Muse, ProQuest, and EBSCO. American Studies uses a double-anonymous peer-review process. Each submission that moves through the process is typically sent to three readers, two from the editorial board and one specialist. AMSJ's acceptance rate is approximately 25%.  Special Issues  Each year, American Studies publishes a special issue that concerns a single theme of interest in the field and is managed by a guest editor or a team of editors. They are the primarily arbiter of proposals, acceptances and revisions, but the final decisions rest with the editors of American Studies. = 2021 - Our Shared Planet: The Environment Issue (double issue) = Guest Edited by Michelle Yates (Columbia College Chicago), Timo M√ºller (University of Konstanz, Germany), Pacharee Sudhinaraset (New York University), and Hee-Jung Serenity Joo (University of Manitoba, Canada) = 2020 - Arts in the Black Press During the Age of Jim Crow = Guest Editors: Kristen Turner (North Carolina State University) and Lucy Caplan (Harvard University) 180x180px = 2019 - New Directions in Black Western Studies = Guest Editors: Kalenda Eaton (University of Oklahoma), Michael K.

Like any other festival there is an abundance of food, events and entertainment such as Swank's Steel City Shows (carnival rides/amusements), Riverhill Battery Warehouse Power Wheels Derby, Cultural Nights, Clarion University's Homecoming weekend and football game, concerts, as well as all of our major events listed at the Clarion Area Chamber of Business and Industry. The Autumn Leaf Festival‚Ñ¢ or \\"ALF\\" as the locals and college kids call it, will have you leaving wanting more and loving the small town culture that is Clarion Pennsylvania. Brief History This annual festival began in 1953 Clarion, Pennsylvania, it became the first recognized Autumn Leaf Festival‚Ñ¢ to be held during the Clarion State College Homecoming. Businesses were asked to decorate, adding a touch of color to the town. Ruth Neiger from Brockway served as Homecoming Queen that year. Little did she or the others involved with the very beginning of Autumn Leaf Festival, know what it would become. Going back to those earlier years offers insight into the history of Autumn Leaf Festival‚Ñ¢. The following year, 1954, the Clarion Chamber of Commerce had an idea. Since the leaves were colored and beautiful during the fall, a larger festival would attract even more people to the area. Two parades were offered. The first was held from 9:30 a.m. until noon. It included veterans from foreign wars, Girl Scouts, volunteer firemen, the Lions Club, the Autumn Leaf Queen‚Äôs float, and seven Clarion County bands. Redbank‚Äôs band received a $50 prize for first place. Two and a half hours later, the Clarion State Teachers College held their homecoming parade with many beautiful floats made by local fraternities and as the years went on local sororities joined in the parade. In 1958, the Autumn Leaf Festival earned status as a permanent event. The Chamber implemented a committee to organize the festivities. Both high schools and college worked together producing impressive floats for the parade. With bands, cars, horses, marching units, and drill teams, joining the floats, this year‚Äôs parade lasted an hour and 15 minutes and was thought to be the best and longest ever seen in Clarion. The Clarion Republican quoted this year as ‚ÄúBest Autumn Leaf Festival Yet is enjoyed by Thousands‚Äù. Food Vendors During the nine-day festival food vendors come and set up their wonderful food that the town does not experience quite often. Vendors go through the Clarion Area Chamber to register and get permission to set up their food stand. A popular and diverse mix of food is a highlight during the festival. Well known vendors such as western Pennsylvania's Bruster's signature ice cream and Quaker Steak & Lube come a make quite a profit. Other food vendors that are set up at the festival are hardy guilty pleasures and a variety of cultural delicacies. This festival has continued to decline in recent years. Less and less food vendors, the entire feel and atmosphere is far from what it once was . Vendors who sell a particular food, i.e. sausage sandwich for example are not permitted to sell at this event because a particular organization sells sausage sandwiches . The food choices are far from what past festivals offered . Pageant The Miss Teen Autumn Leaf Festival‚Ñ¢ scholarship pageant became a permanent event in 1977. On this particular \\"ALF\\" the same events have become reoccurring. The pageant started out as just a homecoming queen who got to ride in the parade. As the years progressed more and more competitions for girls and boys became apparent. However, as the years went boys became less interested and the girls continued on. Thus the Miss Teen Autumn Leaf Festival was created and is still a wonderful scholarship program to this day. A picture of the crafters day during the Autumn Leaf Festival where patrons come to find almost anything from food to furniture. This unique part of the festival is an anticipated treasure hunt to all those who participate in ALF. Farmers and Crafters Day Another popular trademark event is the Farmers and Crafters Day that usually occurs during the last Friday of the nine-day festival. This festival started in 1977 and was originally called Farmers and Merchants Day Craft Show. On this day, 10,000-plus patrons and students come out to observe, buy from or promote the craft stands that line the main street of Clarion on both sides for a mile and a half. The crafters day is such a highlight that local Clarion University of Pennsylvania gives its students a \\"mid-semester break\\", so they can enjoy the crafters day, the following day, to the fullest.\\"Changing Leaves\\" by Scott Lyon Tournament of Leaves Parade In 1956, the annual ‚ÄúTournament of Leaves‚Äù parade was one of the highlights of the Clarion State Teachers College Homecoming. Clarion businesses donated monetary prizes for the float competition whose theme followed movie titles.Clarion, PA: Website From the food to the parade the Farmers National Bank Autumn Leaf Festival‚Ñ¢, internationally recognized festival, is a big part of the community.

It was established as Alexandrovsky District on August 1, 1927, when the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK) issued two Resolutions: \\"On the Establishment of Leningrad Oblast\\" and \\"On the Borders and Composition of the Okrugs of Leningrad Oblast\\".Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 34-35 According to these resolutions, Murmansk Governorate was transformed into Murmansk Okrug, which was divided into six districts (Alexandrovsky being one of them) and included into Leningrad Oblast. The administrative center of the district was in the selo of Alexandrovskoye (Polyarnoye), and later in Murmansk. Upon establishment, Alexandrovsky, Belokamensky, Gryazno-Gubsky, Toros-Ostrovsky, Tyuva-Gubsky, and Ura-Gubsky Selsoviets of the former Alexandrovskaya Volost were included into the district.Administrative- Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 67 On July 31, 1930, the administrative commission of the Leningrad Executive Committee granted the district the status of an ethnic Finnish district.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 39 The Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee confirmed this decision on January 7, 1931. On November 20, 1930, the Presidium of the VTsIK issued a resolution prescribing to rename those districts of the Russian SFSR which share a name with another district.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 41 Consequently, in December 1930, Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee asked the Alexandrovsky District Executive Committee to come up with a new name for the district; one which would be representative of local geographical and ethnic conditions. On January 12, 1931, the Third Congress of the Soviets of Alexandrovsky District issued a resolution, renaming the district \\"Polyarny\\"; the village of Alexandrovskoye was renamed Polyarnoye. The new name, which literally means \\"polar\\", was explained by the fact that of all the districts of Leningrad Oblast, Polyarny is the closest to the North Pole and experiences polar nights in winter. On March 5, 1931 the new name was approved by the administrative commission of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee, and on March 11, 1931‚Äîby its Presidium. Due to ongoing military construction in Polyarnoye, the Presidium of the District Executive Committee passed a Resolution on December 8, 1934 to move the administrative center of the district from Polyarnoye to Murmansk.A Guide to the State Archives, p. 194 The move was completed by the beginning of 1935. Also in 1934, the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee developed a redistricting proposal, which was approved by the Resolution of the 4th Plenary Session of the Murmansk Okrug Committee of the VKP(b) on December 28-29, 1934 and by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Murmansk Okrug Executive Committee on February 2, 1935.Administrative- Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 47‚Äì48 On February 15, 1935, the VTsIK approved the redistricting of the okrug into seven districts, but did not specify what territories the new districts were to include. On February 26, 1935, the Presidium of the Leningrad Oblast Executive Committee worked out the details of the new district scheme and issued a resolution, which transferred Minkinsky Selsoviet of former Kolsko-Loparsky District to Polyarny District. At the same time, the administrative center of Polyarny District was moved from Polyarnoye to Sayda-Guba. The provisions of the February 26, 1935 Resolution, however, were not fully implemented. Due to military construction in Polyarnoye, the administrative center was instead moved to Murmansk in the beginning of 1935 and remained there until September 11, 1938, when by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR the administrative center was moved to Ura-Guba.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 62 After the Winter War of 1939‚Äì1940, the western parts of the Rybachy and Sredny Peninsulas were ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union by the Moscow Peace Treaty.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, pp. 53‚Äì56 By the July 13, 1940 Decision of the Murmansk Oblast Executive Committee, these territories were appended to Polyarny District. The inhabited locality of Abram-Mys was transferred from Polyarny District to the administrative jurisdiction of Murmansk City Soviet by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR of January 3, 1950.Administrative-Territorial Division of Murmansk Oblast, p. 62 On April 18, 1951, the work settlement of Vayenga was elevated in status to that of a town under oblast jurisdiction and renamed Severomorsk.

By the June 14, 1956 Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, the town of Polyarny was demoted in status to that of a town under district jurisdiction and subordinated to Polyarny District. The district was abolished by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of July 9, 1960.Decree #741/18 The district's territory was divided between Kolsky, Pechengsky, and Teribersky Districts, with the town of Polyarny being administratively subordinated to the town of Severomorsk.

They were established in 2011, and the first ceremony was held on June 20, 2011, and streamed live on VH1.com. The fourth ceremony was televised live, for the first time in award history, on 19 June 2014 on The CW. In October 2014, the A&E; Network was granted exclusive rights to broadcast the television and film awards in 2015 and 2016. History The Broadcast Television Journalists Association (BTJA) was founded in 2011 as an offshoot of the Broadcast Film Critics Association. The Awards are produced by executive producer Bob Bain. According to the acting president of the BTJA, Joey Berlin, the Critics' Choice Television Awards were launched \\"to enhance access for broadcast journalists covering the television industry. Just as the Critics‚Äô Choice Movie Awards has been established as an important part of the annual movie awards season, we are confident that the Critics' Choice Television Awards will play a similar role for the television industry.\\" Categories Criticism Following the announcement of the partnership with Entertainment Weekly prior to the 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards in November 2016, several high profile members of the Broadcast Television Journalists Association left the organization, including Michael Ausiello of TV Line, Maureen Ryan of Variety, Ken Tucker of Yahoo! TV, and Michael Schneider of Indiewire. In an article Schneider published shortly after his resignation titled, he wrote: \\"The idea that Entertainment Weekly would be the preferred media outlet for an awards show decided by journalists from many outlets is unusual. (It would be like CNN being named the official partner of the Presidential Debates, even though they‚Äôre moderated and covered by representatives from multiple news organizations.)\\" Following the mass exodus of television critics, the Broadcast Television Journalists Association lost 15%-30% of its membership. This caused the majority of the membership to be made up of internet journalists instead of television critics. During the 7th Critics' Choice Television Awards the fact that several critically acclaimed shows were snubbed such as The Americans, Rectify, The Night Of and You're the Worst in favor of shows with very little to no critical support such as Modern Family, The Big Bang Theory, and House of Cards was credited, and widely criticized, due to this change.

Museum Boijmans van Beuningen, Rotterdam Delft Flower pyramid A tulip vase, or pyramid vase, is a vase designed to put cut flowers and especially tulips in, but it primarily serves as a decorative showpiece. They were first made in the Netherlands in the 17th century and were decorated with Delfts blauw or Chinese decoration. Replicas of the original tulip vases were made in China and were imported by the Dutch East India Company. History and origin The tulip vase is a form of Delftware faience known for its specific blue colour which is used to decorate the earthenware. Delftware originated from the attempt to imitate Chinese porcelain; the Dutch potters tried to copy it, but they did not succeed. The stackable tulip vases were made like that because the potters weren't able to make the vase out of one piece around 1700; it would collapse while firing it. Tulips were introduced in the Netherlands at the end of the 16th century; the bulbs came from Turkey and became a very expensive, fashionable flower. To this day tulips are very popular flowers. Sometimes the pyramid vases, some perhaps inspired by the porcelain tower of Nanjing, were not used as flower vases at all, just as showpieces. Designs Tulip vases can be round, square or oval and they are made in different sizes; the big ones have multiple floors and consist of loose stackable watertight elements and can be up to more than 1.5 metres high. At every level of the vase, one can insert flowers in the appropriate spouts around the vase. The big tulip vases were used to decorate the hearth during the summer and the smaller vases would be placed on the table on a festive occasion.

Built in 1910, it was added to the register in 1992. The wood-frame structure, supported by a concrete foundation and including a full basement, houses a business on the first floor and a domestic apartment on the second floor. Architectural features include a recessed storefront facing a colonnade of fluted wood columns, a double-leaf front door, and plate-glass display windows. Constructed by George Foreman for druggist Thomas Graham, the building preserves a form of commercial architecture typical of the city's neighborhood business districts around 1900. The building was named a Portland Historic Landmark in 1981. Graham, who operated a drugstore in the building for many years, was born in Ontario, Canada, and moved to Portland in 1891. At that time, the Mount Tabor neighborhood, where the building is located, was slowly changing from rural to residential. Minor commercial hubs in the vicinity generally featured small wooden buildings with recessed storefronts facing streetcar lines. The Graham Building is one of only four such buildings that remain intact in central southeast Portland.

Sexual assault charges A 44-year-old maid at the Pierre Hotel on New York City's Upper East Side told authorities that on May 29, 2011, Omar called for room service, asking for a box of tissues to be delivered to his $900-a-night room. She said that when she delivered the tissues to his room, Omar locked his door, grabbed her in a bear hug, and began groping her breasts and kissing her on her neck and lips, squeezed her buttocks, and ground his crotch against her leg. She said that Omar only let her leave after she agreed to give him her phone number, and that she gave him a false one. Police said the maid reported the incident to her supervisor immediately, but that the supervisor told her to report the incident to a hotel security official the following day, and consequently the police weren't notified until the following day. A police spokesman said that detectives found the maid to be credible. Omar was arrested on May 30, 2011. He was charged with two counts of sexual assault, consisting of sex abuse and forcible touching. He appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court, and was released from Rikers Island on June 3, 2011, after posting $25,000 cash bail and surrendering his passport as he awaits trial. Omar was scheduled to return to court on August 23, 2011. His lawyer said he denies the charges.

It was published in Berlin by Gardoon, an Iranian publishing company, and it is the first Persian novel set in Qom and its seminary., ŸÖÿ™ŸÜ ⁄©ÿßŸÖŸÑ ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜŸê ŸÜÿßÿ™ŸÜ€å Natani: The Complete Novel. The novel alternates between the present and the past, a reflection of the protagonist's life as he converses with a complete stranger. The title Natani is a play on words. The Persian word natani means ‚Äúhalf-blooded‚Äù (as in one's half-brother or half-sister, for example) on the one hand, but the title can also be deciphered as na-tani, meaning no-body (negation of the body), or dismemberment. This interpretation of the title embodies the novel's general ambiance, as many times its narrative envelops not merely the struggles of the main character, but the struggles and frustration of a dark, oppressive spirituality that suppresses recognition of the body, while simultaneously being obsessed by it. Synopsis Natani alternates between the present and the past, a reflection of the protagonist's life as he converses with a stranger. A love story between the protagonist, Fouad, and his first love, Zahra, it is romantic with hints of comedy and dramatic undertones simultaneously. The novel spans one night in a hotel lobby in Paris, France, and it is interlaced with flashbacks from Fouad's adolescence in Qom, Iran. A native of Iran, Fouad lives in London and is in Paris to meet his girlfriend. Prior to her arrival, he becomes transfixed by an elegant woman who enters the hotel lobby. Her appearance reminds him of Zahra, and what it felt like to fall in love. Fouad's girlfriend arrives, and they have dinner, and later, Fouad finds himself restless and unable to sleep. He returns to the lobby only to find the woman he saw earlier. He begins talking to her about his life growing up as the son of an ayatollah in the restrictive religious society of Iran. The narrative continues to alternate between their conversation and his flashbacks until the following morning. Fouad offers that one's hometown is not where one lives, but where one \\"gives birth\\". This is how Paris and Qom, in Fouad's mind, stand isolated on two opposite sides of the world. Themes and style The narration allows the reader to follow Fouad and experience the petrifying presence of religion-based power and oppression in its domination of daily life. Fouad's upbringing lacked the presence of women, the result of strict Islamic law in which women have little freedom and are hidden from society. Repression is not unique to women; there is general suppression of the human body and its understanding. As a result, Fouad lives in a masculine, chauvinist environment, and experiences numerous acts of oppression instituted by the political system including the public stoning of women, female genital mutilation (which he sees in a dream), and terrifying scenes taking place in court and in prison. However, the narration maintains a cool, almost humorous perspective as these thoughts and memories flow through Fouad's head, making the novel more of an impersonal account than tragic. The absence of chapters gives the novel the feeling of an extremely long sentence. Instead of outright dialogue, there is subtle, poetic prose. The narrator's voice transforms into an impersonal one sfrom the depth of a historical period that critiques an entire society.

He was also on the executive committee of Agudath Israel of America. Rabbi Elberg was born in Poland and ordained as a Rabbi in Warsaw by Rabbi Menachem Ziemba. He studied at Warsaw's Emek Halacha Yeshiva, where his main teacher was Rabbi Natan Spigelglas. He edited the yeshivah's journal, as a means to combat Haskalah, or Enlightenment. He went to the Montreaux yeshivah between 1935 and 1936 and then moved to Paris as a correspondent for the orthodox press. He enrolled at the Sorbonne, but in 1939 returned to Warsaw for his sister's wedding, which coincided with the invasion by the Nazis. Rabbi Elberg was able to flee, making his way through Poland, then Lithuania and then to Russia. From Vladivostok he sailed to Japan and then to Shanghai, where he arrived on September 1941 with the Mir Yeshiva. His parents, brother, sisters and his teacher Rabbi Natan Spigelglas were all sent to Treblinka where they were murdered. Rabbi Menachem Ziemba was killed in the Warsaw Ghetto. In Shanghai, he married Miriam Slutsker whose father, Rabbi Yehuda Selig Slutsker settled with his wife Dina in Harbin, Manchuria, China, after World War I.http://www.jewsofchina.org/JOC/userdata/SendFile.asp?DBID=1&LNGID;=1&GID;=12 The Elbergs returned to Paris after the war, and Simcha defended a dissertation regarding slavery among Jews in ancient times at the Sorbonne.Katz, Steven et al - Wrestling With God, Oxford University Press 2007, pp. 191-192 He came to New York in 1947 and served as editor of HaPardes, a journal of Talmudic academics.

Background Swindells lived in Burton upon Trent in Staffordshire but was originally from Hyde, Greater Manchester. He was a former Royal Engineers lance corporal who had served with West Midlands Police for 14 years until his death. Death Swindells was stabbed once in the chest, penetrating his heart, while pursuing a suspect, known to be armed with a kitchen knife, on a towpath of the Tame Valley Canal underneath Gravelly Hill Interchange in Aston, Birmingham. The suspect had used the knife earlier in the day to threaten a carpenter carrying out routine repair work on a garden gate outside his council house, which led to Swindells and some of his colleagues later encountering the suspect on a park bench then pursuing him down the towpath for over half-a-mile. The officer's colleagues administered first aid after the stabbing but were unable to save him; the suspect was arrested later in a cemetery, three miles away, by armed police. Aftermath The memorial stone to Swindells at the location of the stabbing. Glaister Earl Butler, a 48-year-old paranoid schizophrenic who resided in a council-owned maisonette in Nechells, Birmingham, was convicted of Swindells's manslaughter. He had been charged with murder but the jury accepted his defence of diminished responsibility. He was detained indefinitely in a secure psychiatric hospital. The jury in Butler's trial heard how he suffered intermittently with paranoid schizophrenia for between 15 and 20 years and had been treated in hospital, sometimes against his will, on more than one occasion in the previous four years, most recently in October 2001. The actions of Butler's treatment staff were criticised in an independent inquiry by Robert Francis, QC, in 2009. A total of 432 doses of the medication prescribed to Butler for his mental disorder were discovered unused in his home; he was allowed to get into financial difficulty by not renewing his housing benefit and owed rent money to the housing authority; and workers, including a consultant psychiatrist, visited Butler's residence only weeks before Swindells' death and observed a large knife on the sofa and damage to a door, but they accepted Butler's explanation that this was caused by martial arts practice and concluded wrongly that there was no cause for concern. Before the attack on Swindells the mental health services were called by police enquiring about Butler's condition and how dangerous he should be considered if officers encounter him, but staff were unable to give full and accurate details due to the poor state of the records.http://www.bsmhft.nhs.uk/EasySiteWeb/GatewayLink.aspx?alId=3192 Swindells was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal posthumously. The Police Memorial Trust erected a stone memorial to him in 2008 at the location of the incident (). The memorial was unveiled by the Trust's founder and chairman Michael Winner.http://www.policememorial.org.uk/Police_Memorial_Trust/PMT_Local_Memorials/PMT- Swindells-2004/PMT-Swindells-2004.htm See also *List of British police officers killed in the line of duty References Category:2004 crimes in the United Kingdom Category:2004 in England Category:2000s in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:History of mental health in the United Kingdom Category:History of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:2008 in England ","title":"Death of Michael Swindells"},{"id":"32022325","text":"Nandipha Mntambo (born 1982) is a South African artist who has become famous for her sculptures, videos and photographs that focus on human female body and identity by using natural, organic materials.  Life  Nandipha Mntambo was born in Swaziland, Southern Africa, in 1982. She graduated with a master's degree in Fine Art (with distinction) from the Michaelis School of Fine Art, University of Cape Town, in June 2007. She lives and works in South Africa.  Work philosophy  In her work, Mntambo focuses on the human body and the organic nature of identity, using mainly natural materials and experimenting with sculptures, videos and photography. One of her favourite materials to use in her pieces is the skin of the cow, often also used as a covering for human bodies ‚Äì boneless sculptures ‚Äì and thus oscillating between evoking the garments that can be shod at will and the bodies that once contained living, breathing, masticating beings with four stomachs. Mntambo embraces this ambiguity and likes to play with the tension between the sightly and the unsightly by manipulating how her viewers negotiate the two aspects of the hide. She uses her own body as the mould for these sculptures and does not intend to make an explicit statement regarding femininity. Rather, Mntambo uses these hides to explore the division between animals and humans, as well as the divide between attraction and repulsion. She states: \\"My intention is to explore the physical and tactile properties of hide and aspects of control that allow or prevent me from manipulating this material in the context of the female body and contemporary art. I have used cowhide as a means to subvert expected associations with corporeal presence, femininity, sexuality and vulnerability. The work I create seeks to challenge and subvert preconceptions regarding representation of the female body.\\"Catalogue statement for Ingabisa at Michael Stevenson 2007. \\"Themes of confrontation, protection and refuge play out particularly in relation to inner conflicts and to notions of self- love/hatred. The bronze, Sengifikile, uses my own features as a foundation, but takes on the guise of a bull. Referencing the head-and-shoulder busts of the Renaissance tradition I challenge male and female roles in society and expected associations with femininity, sexuality and vulnerability.\\"  Exhibitions  = Solo exhibitions (selection) = * 2014 Transience, Stevenson, Johannesburg * 2013 Nandipha Mntambo, Zeitz MOCAA Pavilion, V&A; Waterfront, Cape Town * 2013 Nandipha Mntambo, Andr√©hn-Schiptjenko, Stockholm, Sweden * 2012 Faena, Oliewenhuis Art Museum, Bloemfontein; Standard Bank Gallery, Johannesburg; University of Potchefstroom Art Gallery, Potchefstroom * 2012 The Unspoken, Stevenson, Cape Town * 2011 Faena, National Arts Festival, Grahamstown; Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum, Port Elizabeth; Iziko South African National Gallery, Cape Town * 2009 Umphatsi Wemphi, Brodie/Stevenson, Johannesburg * 2009 The Encounter, Michael Stevenson, Cape Town * 2007 Ingabisa, Michael Stevenson, Cape Town * 2007 Locating me in order to see you (Master's exhibition), Michaelis Gallery, Cape Town =Group exhibitions (selection) = * 2014 Performance Now, Queensland University of Technology Art Gallery, Brisbane, Australia * 2014 Chroma, Stevenson, Cape Town * 2014 The Danjuma Collection: One Man's Trash (Is Another Man's Treasure), 33 Fitzroy Square, London * 2014 From Sitting to Selfie: 300 Years of South African Portraits, Standard Bank Gallery, Johannesburg * 2014 The Divine Comedy.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985 as the Great Northern Passenger Depot. The Saint Paul and Pacific Railroad reached Alexandria in 1878. The Great Northern Railway promoted Alexandria as a tourist destination, with brochures and attractive fares, and the growing tourist traffic made it necessary to replace the original wood-frame depot. The new depot was built more ornately than the usual depots, which were executed from standardized plans developed by the railroads. The Alexandria depot had mosaic tile floors, birch woodwork, enameled brick wainscoting, and comfortable furniture, and it was located conveniently next to a nearby park. The new depot was one of the largest and most ornate along the Great Northern line in Minnesota. The Alexandria depot was an active passenger station until May 1, 1971. The depot's last train; Burlington Northern's \\" Western Star \\" was not continued by Amtrak & made its last run on April 30, 1971. Freight service continued until 1976, at which point the depot was shuttered. Burlington Northern sold the building in 1984, and its new owners completed a restoration and reopened it the next year as the Depot Express Restaurant and Lounge.

Ploshcha Mitskevycha) is one of the main squares in the city of Lviv, Ukraine. Location and history The southern side of the square at the beginning of the 20th century The square, lying between Lviv's old town and the southern part of midtown, was planned and created in the first half of 19th century, after the demolition of the old town's defensive walls in the late 18th century. Primarily, from 1843 it was known as Ferdinand Square (, ), in honour of the Austrian governor of Galicia, Ferdinand Habsburg-d'Este. In 1862 it was renamed St Mary's Square () when a monument dedicated to her was erected in the area. Today it bears the name of Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz, whose monument was placed in the central part of the square in 1904. Lviv prior to World War II was inhabited mostly by Poles and Jews, and belonged to pre-war Poland. In 1939, the Soviet Union in the course of the Invasion of Poland annexed the city. As the new occupant administration perceived St Mary to be a rather inappropriate patron for a square in the centre of a Soviet city, the square underwent peculiar \\"secularisation\\" and was renamed Mickiewicz Square (, ). Although the majority of Polish Lvivians were expelled after the second and permanent Soviet annexation in 1945 and the city was repopulated with Ukrainian and Russian settlers, the monument wasn't demolished during the Soviet era ‚Äì instead it was kept; as well as the name of the square. Adam Mickiewicz Column Mickiewicz's Column with the Sprecher tenement house (to the left), and the bell-tower of the Latin cathedral (to the right) in the background The monument composes of a 21-metre-high column made of Italian granite, and a 3-metre-high statue of Mickiewicz being granted his poet's lyre by the genius of poetry, with some additional elements including the golden torch of Inspiration on the top of the column. Standing in the central part of the square, it was erected in 1904, with the official opening ceremony held on October 30. It was designed and carved by Polish sculptor Antoni Popiel, who won the contest for the design in 1898. The rear of the column base contains the coat-of-arms of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Other Square Features * Monument to St Mary with adjacent fountain. The figure of St Mary, on the order of countess Seweryna Badeni, was sculpted in white, Trembovlian marble by Johann Nepomuk Hautmann from Munich in 1859, and brought to Lviv the same year. In 1904, when the monument of Mickiewicz was erected, the figure was moved north from the centre of the square and remodelled according to a competition won project by Micha≈Ç ≈Åu≈ºecki. In Soviet times, the figure was removed from the top of the fountain and placed in the Boim Chapel (since moved to St Andrew's Church). The fountain was topped with a vase instead. The original composition, including a copy of the St Mary figure, was reconstructed in 1997.http://www.lwow.com.pl/brama/figura.html * Sprecher's tenement house. The six story high edifice with mansard roof, was ordered by Jonas and Gizela Sprecher and constructed between 1914 and 1922, according to a design by Ferdynand Kassler from Micha≈Ç Ulam's architectural bureau. The architecture contains a mixture of neoclassical and early modernist features. Due to its height and size it was dubbed Lviv's first \\"skyscraper\\". * Hotel George.

Recorded at Dockside Studios in Maurice, Louisiana, the album was released on June 7, 2011 through Glassnote Records. Givers was founded in 2008 after a last-minute impromptu jam session at a Lafayette pub. The group, which had roots in zydeco, jazz and Cajun music, continued performing part-time until they opened for Dirty Projectors in 2009, who brought them along for an East Coast tour. Their first extended play, Givers, was released for free online in 2009 and features earlier versions of songs on In Light. The album was recorded in January 2010 at Dockside Studios in Maurice, Louisiana. The group signed to Glassnote Records in February 2011, who issued In Light in June 2011. The album received largely favorable reviews from music critics. Background Givers was formed in 2008 in Lafayette, Louisiana by Tiffany Lamson, Taylor Guarisco, Kirby Campbell, Josh LeBlanc, William Henderson, and Nick Stephan. The band knew one another from high school in Lafayette, where \\"there's two or three clubs and everybody plays there and supports each other.\\" Guarisco had toured with a zydeco band, while the other future members dabbled in Cajun and jazz music. Lamson grew up with gospel music as her parents were pastors, and she sang in the church band; she instead focused on feeling the music emotionally while the other members studied music. The band's earliest origins date to when Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005. Lamson had just started her freshman year at the University of New Orleans, where much of the band first met. Guarisco and Lamson were rooming together when the storm hit, leaving them with roughly 15 feet of water in their apartment. With school on hold and nowhere to live, the duo returned home with little to do, and began making music together and performing at open mic nights. While Lafayette was \\"suitably anonymous\\" before the disaster, nearly 30,000 people moved to the city following the tragedy, resulting an \\"explosion in culture.\\" Givers came together in 2008, when Lamson and Guarisco recruited Kirby Campbell, Will Henderson and Josh LeBlanc for a two-hour slot at a Lafayette pub. Lamson and Guarisco had never sung prior to joining the band, and Josh LeBlanc was a jazz trumpeter before learning the bass. The unnamed band hopped on the last-minute slot after another local band dropped off the bill, and improvised the entire set. They were phoned by the pub and invited back, and they continued to perform improvised sets. \\"I mean, we weren't a band, we were just making shit up,\\" Guarisco later said. \\"That was how songs were created, that total free- form state where we just played and recorded and then excerpted and rearranged.\\" The band scoured their iTunes libraries looking for interesting song titles they could narrow down for a band name; Guarisco picked a Lucky Dragons song called \\"Givers.\\" The band recorded their debut EP in Campbell's bedroom, and released it online for free in 2009. After the newly christened Givers performed at Baton Rouge's stalwart music hall Spanish Moon, booking agent Aaron Scruggs gave the band what would become one the \\"major accidents that became very fruitful occurrences,\\" according to Guarisco. For their Baton Rouge show, Dirty Projectors had a rare opening slot, and Scruggs gave it to Givers, who had been performing only part-time since their 2008 formation. Dirty Projectors were Guarisco's favorite band and a key inspiration in creating Givers. To prepare for the performance, the band rehearsed eight hours a day for a week. Frontman Dave Longstreth subsequently invited the band along as support for an East Coast tour. Recording and production The band recorded their debut album in January 2010 at the \\"magical, swampy [and] historical\\" Dockside Studios in Maruice, Louisiana, which had previously hosted acts such as B.B. King, Derek Trucks, Mavis Staples and Dr. John. The group cooped up in guest rooms along the banks of the Vermilion Bayou in Maurice, and spent 20 days recording the album. In contrast to their debut EP, which was recorded in Campbell's bedroom and sporadically recorded with a list of limitations, they viewed Dockside as a virtual utopia in contrast. As they were completely separated from city life ‚Äî \\"You can't hear cars, there's no light pollution,\\" said Guarisco ‚Äî they never found themselves distracted, simply waking up to record until \\"[we] were dead tired\\" in the late night. Each song from the band's debut EP was re-recorded and revamped; the band particularly redeveloped \\"Meantime,\\" in order to \\"recreate it in a better light.\\" The band felt the recording process \\"immaculate,\\" feeling that the studio offered \\"unlimited possibilities.\\" For production, the band hooked up with Ben Allen, who helmed Animal Collective's pop-crossover breakthrough Merriweather Post Pavilion (2009). Korey Richey co-produced the album alongside Guarisco, and the record was completed by the time the band signed to Glassnote the following February. Composition, theme and artwork Guarisco felt the theme of In Light is approaching life through appreciation and love. The album was recorded with no particular concept in mind, and the theme \\"came after the fact,\\" according to Lamson. After recording, the group \\" had all this time to just sit on what we had done,\\" and they found the songs happened to come out as an expression of being grateful. \\"Like I don't care how bad your life is, there's always something around you to be grateful for,\\" said Guarisco in 2011. \\"Our songs are a testament to that kind of thinking.\\" The album begins with \\"Up Up Up,\\" the first song the band improvised together that has roots in their first performance. The melody and lyrics remain largely unchanged from its original form, which was recorded by Lamson on a digital handheld recorder. \\"Up Up Up\\" and \\"Saw You First\\" utilize Caribbean rhythms, steel drums and \\"unpredictable\\" instrumental breaks. \\"Meantime\\" features an \\"explosive afrobeat chorus\\" that Soundcheck compared to \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" by Vampire Weekend. \\"Ceilings of Plankton\\" combines \\"Annuals- style harmonies with bouncy drums, flutes, and a synth-led coda that recalls electropop acts like Neon Indian.\\" \\"Saw You First\\" has been described as \\"Arcade Fire-sized charge retreating to the band's blissed out grooves,\\" and the first three tracks have been called \\"childlike bursts of unabashed joy.\\" The music on In Light largely drew comparisons to Vampire Weekend and Talking Heads. To visualize the album artwork, the group took trips to record stores and photographed album art that they felt captivated and inspired by. The group then collaborated with Rob Carmichael of Seen Studios. Reception =Commercial performance= The album received heavy radio rotation in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, as well as in New York, Minneapolis and Seattle. =Critical reception= In Light received largely favorable reviews from music critics. Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post described the record as an \\"instant mood-lifter,\\" writing that \\"There‚Äôs not a lethargic moment here [‚Ä¶] the band‚Äôs exuberance is barely containable.\\" Stephen Thompson of NPR felt In Light reflected \\" that knockabout, anything- goes vibe, just in time for the season that suits it best.\\" Devon Maloney of The Phoenix called the record \\"an impressive step forward ‚Äî it seriously contends for the title of this summer's go-to indie-pop record.\\" Allmusic's Matt Collar called In Light an \\"accomplished, ambitious debut,\\" while comparing it to \\"the peppy pseudo-Afro pop of Vampire Weekend and the percussive, improv-heavy dance rock of Local Natives.\\" Ryan Reed of Paste felt the record rose above its reference points, \\"because the songs are usually excellent [‚Ä¶] speaking strictly sonics, In Light is literally the brightest album I‚Äôve heard in ages.\\" Q felt \\"This world music/indie rock mix is countered by the affecting melancholy of their quieter moments,\\" while Ari Lipsitz of CMJ opined that Givers were a \\"seriously cute band that writes seriously catchy love songs that you will probably seriously enjoy ‚Äî if you're all right with that ebullience thing.\\" Emily Temple of American Songwriter praised the record as \\"impossibly optimistic,\\" writing that \\"The music is charismatic and chaotic, full of shouts, clanging and bright guitars ‚Äî listen to it with your eyes closed and you‚Äôll see everything short of sparkling blue stars.\\" Alternative Press called the music on In Light \\"enthralling,\\" summarizing that \\"Givers have created a debut that will surely set them atop the indie-rock world, if not only for their strict adherence to trying everything possible and succeeding gloriously at it all.\\" Jon Young of Spin recommended that the record is \\"best absorbed in small portions, allowing you to savor the seriously catchy melodies and uplifting vibes,\\" feeling that the songs blur together when consumed at once. Fraser McAlpine of the BBC Music parsed the record, describing it as \\"an exhilarating first listen: you just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going to happen next.\\" However, several reviewers were unimpressed with the often-changing song structure on In Light. While Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian praised the band's enthusiasm, she felt that \\"The formula of cramming 30 different songs into one is fun for a while, and it's invigorating, but ultimately it's hard to shake a sense of over-indulgence.\\" Sam Wolfson on NME criticized the often-changing song structure on In Light, writing that \\"While their love of premeditated spontaneity might be admirable in jazzier quarters, in reality it means that almost every song on their debut is marred by sudden changes in time signature, key and genre.\\" Mojo was similarly mixed, writing that \\"It's a shame that their modishness acts against them, but sometimes, playing all the right notes in the right order just isn't enough.\\"  Track listing  Personnel ;Givers *Tiffany Lamson ‚Äì vocals, ukulele, percussion, art concept *Taylor Guarisco ‚Äì vocals, guitar, bass guitar on \\"Atlantic\\", art concept, production *Kirby Campbell ‚Äì drums, samples, percussion, art concept *Josh LeBlanc ‚Äì bass guitar, lead guitar on \\"In My Eyes\\" and \\"Atlantic\\", art concept *William Henderson ‚Äì keyboards/synthesizers, samples, organ, flutes, art concept ;Additional musicians *Nick Stephan ‚Äì keyboards/synthesizers and flutes on \\"Saw You First\\", \\"Ceiling of Plankton\\" and \\"Atlantic\\" *Sam Craft ‚Äì strings on \\"Ripe\\", \\"Noche Nada\\" and \\"Words\\" *Jack Craft ‚Äì strings on \\"Ripe\\", \\"Noche Nada\\" and \\"Words\\" *\\"Our Family Members\\" ‚Äì claps and love on \\"Noche Nada\\" ;Production *Kirby Campbell ‚Äì production, additional engineer *Korey Richey - production, engineer *Eric Heigle - engineer on \\"Atlantic\\" *Tony Daigle - additional engineer *Ben Allen - mixing engineer *Chris Coady - mixing engineer on \\"In My Eyes\\", \\"Atlantic\\", \\"Go Out All Night\\" and \\"Words\\" *Greg Calbi - mastering engineer *Daniel Glass ‚Äì A&R; *Aaron Scruggs ‚Äì management ;Artwork *Rob Carmichael ‚Äì photo illustration and design *Jason Frank Rothenberg ‚Äì back cover photo *Cameron Ground ‚Äì interior spread photo *Eliot Brasseaux ‚Äì band photo *Kim Dupuis ‚Äì additional photography *Anne Blenker ‚Äì additional art contribution Notes and references External links Category:2011 debut albums Category:Glassnote Records albums ","title":"In Light"},{"id":"32022387","text":"Thomas M. Harrigan was the Deputy Administrator for the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and a DEA Special Agent for nearly 25 years. He was nominated by President Barack Obama to the position of DEA Deputy Administrator on February 18, 2011. He was confirmed as DEA Deputy Administrator by the United States Senate on March 29, 2012. He was appointed as DEA's Chief of Operations in 2008 and is a principal advisor to DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart on all enforcement-related matters. DEA career history Special Agent Harrigan began his career as a DEA Special Agent in 1987 in DEA's New York Field Division. Among the cases he was involved with were the notorious Rodriguez-Orejuela Drug Trafficking Organization case that led to the arrest and incarceration of several high- ranking members of this Colombian-based cartel and the seizure of multiple tons of cocaine and millions in illicit proceeds. In 1994, he was assigned to the Bangkok Country Office in Thailand. While there he directed an investigation that led to the identification and dismantlement of an organization responsible for the importation of large quantities of heroin into the United States. This organization utilized dozens of Americans as couriers who smuggled heroin from Southeast Asia to Chicago. In 1996 he was promoted to the position of Group Supervisor and returned to the United States to work in the Newark Field Division where he managed a DEA Task Force that was recognized by state and county officials for its significant enforcement achievements. In 1999 he served as a Staff Coordinator in the Office of Congressional and Public Affairs at DEA Headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. In 2000, he was promoted to the Operations Division as Section Chief of the Dangerous Drugs and Chemicals Section where he oversaw a multi-jurisdictional investigation that resulted in the largest LSD seizure in history. In 2001, he was reassigned as the Deputy Chief in the Office of Domestic Operations. During that time, he served as Senior Advisor to the Chief of Domestic Operations, assisting in and providing oversight and direction for DEA's Domestic Operations' Section Chiefs on a variety of budgetary and operational matters. In 2003 he left the Operations Division and began his service as the Assistant Special Agent-in-Charge for the Washington Field Division where he had responsibility over High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Forces (HIDTA) in West Virginia, and in the administrative and special support units. In 2004, he was appointed to the Senior Executive Service to serve as the Chief of Enforcement Operations. In this role, Mr. Harrigan was the principal deputy for the Chief of Operations and directed the re-organization of DEA's Operations Division. Chief of DEA's operations In 2008 Special Agent Harrigan was appointed DEA's Chief of Operations. Among his many domestic and international drug enforcement responsibilities is the coordination of DEA's fight against the Mexico-based drug cartels and working with other governments to defeat them as their violence spreads. In May 2011 he testified before Congress where he said that the lessons learned from the rise in violence from fighting Mexico's drug cartels should be used to shape new efforts to fight the cartels' spread to Central America. \\"We must manage expectations, and accept that as (counternarcotics) efforts increased in Mexico, so too did violence,\\" and that \\"DEA will work with our foreign partners to explore means of lessening the degree of any similar outcome in Central America,\\" he continued. \\"We must recognize that, in such violence, we are witnessing acts of true desperation ‚Äî the actions of wounded, vulnerable, and dangerous criminal organizations.\\" On February 18, 2011 Special Agent Harrigan was nominated by the President to serve as Deputy Administrator of the DEA. This nomination is pending confirmation by the United States Senate. Upon hearing of the nomination by President Obama, DEA Administrator Leonhart said, \\"His years of hands-on drug law enforcement experience in DEA operations around the world, and the proven leadership abilities he has shown will be tremendously important assets as together we continue our work of keeping the American people safe from dangerous drugs and those who traffic in them.\\" Personal life Harrigan, a native of New York City, has a master's degree in Education from Seton Hall University and has attended a number of government, military, and private leadership courses including Duke University's Fuqua School of Business Leadership Program. Harrigan is married and has four children.

MRSC St. John's is tasked with coordinating maritime search and rescue operations in waters surrounding the province of Newfoundland and Labrador and had an area of responsibility that is located wholly within the search and rescue region (SRR) of Joint Rescue Coordination Centre Halifax (JRCC Halifax). In Canada, MRSCs are established to enhance maritime SAR co-ordination through improved communications and local knowledge. MRSCs thus expedite the initiation of appropriate action and allow a timely response to SAR incidents within their Search and Rescue Sub-Region (SRS). The responsibilities of an MRSC are similar to those of a JRCC, but on a smaller scale. MRSCs carry out SAR co- ordination functions under the authority of the SRR Commander through the JRCC, including co-ordinating responses to humanitarian incidents in accordance with national and regional policies. MRSCs normally co-ordinate maritime SAR incidents which occur within their SRS. As such, MRSC St. John's is responsible for tasking appropriate maritime SAR resources in order to solve an incident. This is most often the dedicated SAR vessels of the Canadian Coast Guard, however, they may also initiate a request for other resources such as Canadian Coast Guard Auxiliary vessels, Royal Canadian Air Force primary or secondary SAR aircraft, Royal Canadian Navy warships, or Royal Canadian Mounted Police and municipal police small craft as required. Any SAR operation in response to an aircraft incident remains the responsibility of JRCC Halifax or JRCC Trenton and MRSC Qu√©bec may assist the JRCC in tasking and coordinating any maritime resources and provide local expertise and assistance to the JRCC.

Building, Perfect Fit Manufacturing and simply Yale Union (YU), in southeast Portland, Oregon, is a two-story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built largely of brick in 1908, and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations, it was added to the register in 2007. Two-story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an L-shaped structure that shares a party wall with a building to the east. Preservation of elements of Portland's industrial laundry era, and its relation to the women's labor movement and the rise of the middle class in the United States, are factors in the building's listing on the National Register. Built and first operated by businessman Charles F. Brown, the building was bought in 1927 by Home Services Company, a power-laundry consortium. American Linen Supply and then Perfect Fit Manufacturing, a maker of automotive fabrics, used the building after Home Services sold it in 1950. Acquired by Alter LLC in 2008, the building is home to Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center. Description Egyptian Revival detail of the Yale Union Laundry Building Located at 800 Southeast 10th Avenue, the building occupies the west half of the block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence is seen in the ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large garage door along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side. The original building's main floor has vaulted ceilings, large windows, brick walls, a flat roof, and wooden cross beams. The mezzanine consists of three rooms. The second floor has large windows and vaulted ceilings, restrooms, and a lunchroom. Stairs and elevators connect the levels, including the basement and its boiler room. A lobby and office in the southwest corner of the main floor can be entered from inside or via the original main door off Southeast 10th Avenue. Following purchase in 2008, renovations began to convert the building into a contemporary arts center. Architects designed gallery spaces, a bookstore and cafe, a 100-seat room, library and kitchen. Geothermal heating supplied by an aquifer underneath the building will contribute to the goal of LEED Platinum status. History The Yale Union Laundry Building was built to house a commercial laundry during an era, roughly 1900 to 1950, when many urban U.S. households sent out their laundry for cleaning rather than doing it at home. Before the invention of the steam laundry machine in the mid-19th century, women did most domestic washing at home using simple machines such as scrub boards, wooden tubs, and clothes lines. Steam-driven washing machines, and equipment for starching, ironing, and related tasks made industrial laundries feasible by the turn of the century. In 1908, Charles F. Brown, who entered the laundry business in the Midwest in 1892, moved to Portland to build the Yale Laundry Building, and to operate an industrial power laundry on its premises. The building's basement contained boilers to heat wash water, and the main part of the first floor had beams capable of supporting heavy washing machines. The first and second floors had large windows to admit light and to release heat and steam. At the time of the building's construction, Portland had 68 commercial laundries of varied types and sizes. By 1916, the Yale Laundry, one of the larger laundries, employed 125 people, many of whom were women. Northwest second-floor interior, 2011 Federal and state laws regulating hours, wages, and working conditions changed markedly in the United States during the early 20th century. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that women could not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations and the rise of organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927. By 1931, more than 80 percent of the services offered by industrial laundries were sold to individual families. However, as the Great Depression continued, many people could no longer afford the services, and business declined. The decline continued after World War II when electric washers and dryers meant for home use became affordable to a large percentage of the populace. As individual customers disappeared, factory laundries turned to specialized services such as washing diapers or linens. In 1950, the American Linen Supply Company bought the Yale Laundry Company. In 1959, Perfect Fit Manufacturing began to use the building to make auto seat covers, tire covers, and other automotive fabrics. Perfect Fit remained in the building through 2006. =Yale Union= Since 2008, the building has housed Yale Union (YU), a contemporary arts center. Alter LLC, associated with the Monfort Family Foundation, purchased the building for $3.5 million and intended to fund renovations and operations until the arts center generated revenue on its own. Renovations costing an additional $7.2 million, also funded by Alter, included a bookstore and cafe, and a 100-seat room. The center was officially unveiled in November 2010 with a renovated kitchen and additional improvements planned. More than 600 people attended YU's first public exhibit in May 2011.

Fattman (born July 1, 1984) is an American state legislator currently serving in the Massachusetts State Senate. Prior to being elected to the Massachusetts Senate, Fattman represented the 18th Worcester district in the Massachusetts House of Representatives as a Republican. Before serving as a state representative, he attended Suffolk University and Tufts University and served on the Sutton Board of Selectmen from 2006 to 2011. Personal life Ryan was born on July 1, 1984 in Sutton. Ryan graduated from Sutton High School. Ryan's mother is a small business owner, running her own preschool in Worcester called Kids Kount Nursery School. Ryan's father is a long-time businessman. Fattman graduated from Sutton High School in 2003, and went on to study at Suffolk University for his bachelor's degree. For his master's degree, Fattman went on to Tufts University, where he was selected for the Harvard University Kennedy School Rappaport Public Policy Fellowship, class of 2008. Fattman met his wife at a high school dance, and proposed at the same location nine years later to the day they met. Ryan and his wife Stephanie, the current Worcester County Register of Probate, reside in the town of Webster since their marriage in May 2013.  Political career  = Board of Selectmen = In 2006, Ryan announced his candidacy for the Sutton Board of Selectmen. On May 23, 2006, Ryan earned 70% of the vote, defeating two long- term incumbents. At 21 years old, this made him the youngest Selectman in the history of Sutton, and one of the youngest in MA history. He was re-elected in 2009 for a second term. During his five-year tenure, Fattman is largely credited with the restoration of Marion's Camp, helping expand Sutton's commercial tax base on Rt 146, senior citizen property tax relief, and working with fellow board members to create a Capital Stabilization Fund for capital purchases. He also placed an emphasis on increasing cell phone coverage in Sutton with the construction of a cell tower in West Sutton. Fattman joined a subcommittee on Tax Increment Financing for Business Development with fellow Selectman Michael Chizy. They negotiated with small businesses to alleviate the 90% residential tax burden, reducing it from above $12 to below $11.50, at a time when most other towns were increasing their residential tax rate. = State Representative = In April 2010, Fattman announced his candidacy for State Representative. Down early in the polls by 32 points, Fattman knocked on nearly 8,000 doors throughout the campaign and won all five towns in the district. Fattman was outspent by a margin of two-to-one, yet defeated eight- year incumbent Jennifer Callahan, 53-47%. The surprising upset received attention from statewide media outlets. The Worcester Telegram and Gazette described Fattman's win as the \\"most surprising upset\\" in Central Massachusetts. Boston Globe Columnist Yvonne Abraham said \\"the new standard- bearer for beleaguered Massachusetts Republicans is a cherubic 26-year-old.\\" Fattman had a perfect 100% voting attendance record for 2011. =State Senator= Ryan Fattman was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate on November 4, 2014 after serving two terms in the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He is the first Republican to win an election to the Worcester-Norfolk Senate seat since 1938, when Dr. Wilfred Bazinet was elected from Webster.https://malegislature.gov/People/Profile/RCF0 Fattman defeated the twenty-year incumbent and President Pro Tempore (since 2013) Richard T. Moore. He currently has a 100% attendance record in the State Senate.https://malegislature.gov/People/Profile/RCF0 =Policy issues= Fattman co-sponsored a House Republican Budget Amendment #483, which increased UGGA Local Aid funds by $65 Million in FY12, including $369,546 to his new legislative district. Fattman has continued his campaign on ethical reform for public officials. House Bill H03236, which Fattman sponsored, calls to eliminate the per-diem that legislators are paid for driving to work. Fattman became the focus of national media attention for a statement in defense of implementation of the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Communities program. Asked if illegal immigrants should report being victimized by a violent crime, he was quoted saying that \\"if someone is here illegally, they should be afraid to come forward.\\" Upon seeing the article, Fattman issued a statement stating he was misquoted throughout the article, and that his true feelings were not properly expressed. Fattman stressed that Secure Communities is \\"directed to criminals, not victims,\\" responding to criticism that the program could prevent illegal immigrants from coming forward if they are victims of a crime, for fear of deportation. Fattman is currently working with the Ellsessar family of Sutton on legislation requiring public schools to have a medical emergency response plan for medical incidents. Michael Ellsessar, a 16-year-old JV Football Player from Sutton, collapsed on the field during an away game and was not able to be resuscitated. This legislation, known as Michael's Bill, would require schools to plan responses for similar events to prevent further deaths. For example, if a school possessed an AED, the school would have a plan to move it out to the athletic fields. In July 2020, as the Massachusetts legislature worked to develop emergency legislation to respond to a swell of George Floyd protests in Massachusetts aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement, Sen. Fattman gained state-wide attention for employing procedural tactics to delay the progression and debate of a sweeping police reform and accountability bill, citing the need for public input, especially from law enforcement personnel. The bill, which among other measures bans chokeholds and the use of tear gas, and requires officers to intervene when excessive force is employed by a comrade, passed the senate on July 14th, with Fattman voting \\"Nay\\".

It operated from 1898 to 1913. History Znanie initially published books for a mass audience on natural science, history, education, and art. Maxim Gorky joined Znanie in 1900 and became its director in late 1902. Through Znanie, Gorky brought together many of the best known realist writers of the time. Znanie published the collected works of Gorky (9 vols.), Alexander Serafimovich, Alexander Kuprin, Vikenty Veresaev, Stepan Skitalets, Nikolai Teleshov and many others.The Great Soviet Encyclopedia, 3rd Edition (1970-1979).A Writer Remembers, Teleshov, Hutchinson, NY, 1943. Znanie became known as the most progressive of all Russian publishing houses directed toward broad democratic reader-ships. In 1904 the publishing house began issuing the Znanie Collections, which brought together short stories, novels, poetry and essays written by Russian writers, and by foreign writers such as Emile Verhaeren, publishing 40 volumes by 1913. Vladimir Lenin wrote that Gorky was aiming through these collections \\"at a concentration of the best forces of Russian literature.\\" The circulation of the collections reached 65,000 copies. They included the works of Gorky, Anton Chekhov, Kuprin, Serafimovich, Leonid Andreev, Ivan Bunin, Veresaev, Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak, Sergey Gusev- Orenburgsky, Evgeny Chirikov and Nikolai Garin-Mikhailovsky, among others. Maxim Gorky, Konstantin Pyatnitsky and Stepan Skitalets, 1902. The writers featured in the collections from 1905 to 1907 were united in their protest against tsarism, oppression, national discord, religious prejudice, and bourgeois morality. Gorky and Serafimovich, on one hand, used socialist realism; Andreyev and certain others, however, were subject to the influences of the decadent movement. After the 1905 Russian Revolution this difference became more marked. In 1911 principal editorship of the Znanie collections was transferred to Viktor Mirolyubov. In addition to publishing the collected works of young writers and the Znanie Collections, the Znanie Association issued the so-called Penny Library, in which the short works of Znanie writers were published. Gorky also carried out assignments for the Bolsheviks, publishing a series of sociopolitical pamphlets, including the works of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Paul Lafargue and August Bebel. The Penny Library issued over 300 publications, with editions totaling nearly four million copies. During the period of reaction after the 1905 Russian Revolution many participants in Znanie left the publishing house. Gorky, forced to live abroad during this period, severed his ties with the publishing house in 1912.

Most structures in the district are commercial buildings rising two to three stories. Immediately to the west of the historic district is Portland's east side industrial area, and to the east are industrial and residential areas. History The historic district is part of a larger area originally designated in 1850 as the East Portland Townsite. In 1861 James B. Stephens platted the area into 200-foot by 200-foot blocks from a portion of his donation land claim. The townsite was roughly bounded by the Willamette River to the west, 12th Street to the east, Glisan Street to the north, and Hawthorne Street to the south. By 1870, the Oregon Central Railroad included a branch through East Portland, and the community was incorporated in 1871. Commercial development increased, and in 1891 East Portland was annexed into the city of Portland. Designation of buildings The historic period of significance for the district is 1883 through 1930. Buildings designated as \\"primary\\" contributing properties were constructed between 1883 and 1915. Those designated as \\"secondary\\" were constructed between 1916 and 1930. A third designation, \\"historic but non-contributing,\\" denotes buildings constructed within the period of significance but which have been modernized or altered beyond their historic identity. The East Portland Grand Avenue Historic District includes a total of 74 properties, and 50 are designated either primary, secondary, or historic non-contributing. A fourth designation, \\"non-contributing,\\" denotes buildings constructed after 1930. The district contains six non-contributing buildings and 18 vacant lots.

Background Melissa Shelver, a young pregnant woman, was shot in the abdomen with the (successful) intention of killing her unborn child. The shooter and first accused, Ludwe Mshumpa, had entered into a conspiracy with the baby's father and second accused, David Best, who had paid him to commit the crime. In order to make the attack appear genuine, and thus to clear himself of suspicion, Best had arranged for Mshumpa to shoot him as well. Both Best and Shelver barely survived.S v Mshumpa at 2 Case The court was first tasked with determining whether or not Mshumpa should be convicted of the attempted murder of the mother. It found that the risk of death to the mother was eminently foreseeable in the act of shooting (it was established that she would have died had she not received medical treatment),S v Mshumpa at 2 and that dolus eventualis could not be excluded merely because the shooter's intention was only to kill the foetus. As a result, Mshumpa was found guilty of the attempted murder of Shelver.S v Mshumpa at 66 The court's next consideration was whether to convict Mshumpa of the attempted murder of Best.

The Tudor Revival style house was finished in 1925 and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It was built by the architectural firm Lawrence & Holford and was one of architect Ellis Lawrence‚Äôs designs for a building contractor named James Hickey. The house was built with the intention of being a model home in the Eastmoreland neighborhood.  History  After he moved to Portland Oregon in 1906, Ellis Lawrence designed numerous residential and nonresidential structures, around 260 of which currently survive in Washington and Oregon. He worked in a variety of architectural styles but in his middle period between 1912 and 1930 he worked mostly with Historic Period styles. This is exemplified in the Tudor Revival style of the James Hickey House. The James Hickey House is one of several houses Lawrence designed in the Eastmoreland neighborhood and it is the only house Lawrence designed in this neighborhood that has not been altered significantly. The contractor and financier James S. Hickey Sr. was born in 1893 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and moved to Portland, Oregon in 1924. In 1925 he served as contractor for the James Hickey House which was to be his own house. James Hickey and his family lived in the James Hickey House up until the 40s.  Description  The Eastmoreland neighborhood where the house is located was developed with the intention of being an upper class suburb. The house is surrounded by similarly sized houses. It is edged by small shrubs on the front, large rhododendrons on the garage side, and the facade is shaded by large maple trees. The house's living room is located on the front elevation which is uncommon in Lawrence's designs. This was likely due to the minimal view potential of the flat lot the house was built on. Some of the houses notable features include its decorative brickwork, brick and half- timber exterior surfacing, leaded glass windows and French doors, wrought iron stair railing and door hardware, and tiled living room fireplace. = Exterior = The James Hickey House is rectangular in design and has the addition of two side wings and a rear bay. The south side wing was added recently. The back yard is enclosed by a covered lattice fence which also keeps the recently added side wing from view. The house‚Äôs main roof is formed by a gable with clipped north and south ends. This roof is intersected to the front by a large gable at the south end and a smaller gable which extends over the houses main entrance. The gable over the front entrance is supported by a pair of chamfered porch posts and is two stories. The house‚Äôs garage has a clipped gable roof as well. The exterior of the first floor is covered in red brick and the exterior of the second floor has a half timbered surface. The off center exterior chimney contains decorative brickwork. The front door of the house which is nested underneath the two story extending gable is decorated with a hand forged handle and front plate and is in the middle of a pair of iron lanterns. = Interior = While many of the building‚Äôs exterior features such as the brickwork, exterior chimney, half timbered surface, and gables exemplify the Tudor Revival style, the building's interior is more modernized and has fewer Tudor features. Some of the few Tudor Revival features of the interior are leaded glass windows, exposed beams in the living room, and a wrought iron stair railing. The house‚Äôs floor is made out of oak and the stair treads are made with mahogany. There are original steam heat registers in every room of the building. The fireplace is contained in the east wall and has no mantelpiece. The rooms are organized around the entrance hall on the first floor. The first floor contains a living room, dining room, kitchen, sitting room, breakfast room and a half bath. The sitting room originally was an exterior side porch. The second floor contains three bedrooms, a library and two baths. All rooms on the second floor have sloped ceilings. The house also has a finished basement.

Operating more than 80 nuclear-powered ships, the United States Navy is currently the largest naval force in the world.About the U.S. Navy History The United States Navy first began research into the applications of nuclear power in 1946 at the Manhattan Project's nuclear power-focused laboratory to develop a nuclear power plant. Eight men were assigned to the project. One of these men was Admiral Hyman G. Rickover, who is known as the \\"Father of the Nuclear Navy.‚Äù =Submarines= The first nuclear-powered submarine, the , was launched and commissioned in 1954. The development of the nuclear-powered submarine greatly increased capabilities; the duration a sub could remain underwater was now limited only by food supply. By using power generated from the reactor, air was able to be continually recycled and water was able to be distilled from seawater. The nuclear-powered sub could also reach and maintain much higher speeds than its predecessors. Shortly after the USS Nautilus, the was commissioned. The reactor engine in the USS Seawolf was a liquid metal- cooled (sodium) reactor. This proved to be a more difficult reactor to maintain and was eventually replaced with a pressurized-water reactor, the same design used in the USS Nautilus. The first production run of nuclear submarines was the , which was followed by the . The Skipjack was designed with a more advanced teardrop hull that provided greater hydrodynamics, which allowed the submarines to achieve higher speeds while producing less noise. Today, the United States Navy operates four different classes of submarine: the , , and es. The United States has a total of 70 submarines on active duty as of 2018. All are nuclear-powered. There are 18 Ohio class, 14 Virginia class, 3 Seawolf class and 35 Los Angeles class. =Aircraft carriers= Shortly to follow in utilizing nuclear technology was the aircraft carrier. Commissioned in 1961, the USS Enterprise was the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. The first production class of nuclear-powered aircraft carrier is the . Ten Nimitz-class aircraft carriers in total were produced with all remaining in active duty. This class of aircraft carrier is currently intended to be replaced with the . The Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers are still in production, with three currently being produced. There are plans to produce an additional seven vessels. The United States to this day has a total of 11 nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and controls the largest carrier fleet in the world.Aircraft Carrier Fleet Strength =Cruisers= For almost 40 years, the US Navy had nuclear powered cruisers as a part of its fleet, beginning in 1961 with the commissioning of and ending in 1998 with the decommissioning of . The Navy had a total nine nuclear cruisers spread across five different classes. The Navy found they were too costly to maintain and eventually stopped producing them. Long Beach was equipped with a C1W cruiser reactor while the other eight ships were equipped with D2G destroyer reactors. Nuclear equipment =Power generation= All of the Navy's submarines and aircraft carriers are propelled by nuclear power. In order for this to happen, each ship essentially contains a small nuclear power plant. The power generated by this reactor is created through nuclear fission. During the process of nuclear fission, there are two products of significant importance in the reactor: heat and radiation. The heat is generated from the breaking down of the fuel source (uranium). Uranium creates heat through a self- sustaining reaction as it is bombarded by free neutrons created during fission and then reabsorbed to continue the reaction. The heat generated from the reaction heats water in the steam generator. Due to the pressurization of the system, the water that cools the reactor does not boil, but creates a media to transfer the heat to the steam plants to create steam. As steam is produced, it is forced through a series of pipes and past different turbines, causing the turbine to spin and generate electrical power or propel the ship. The steam is then cooled and converted back to water, which is then sent back to the steam generator and the process is repeated. =Environmental impact= Nuclear reactors create energy through fission, as opposed to burning fuel. Because of this, no greenhouse gases are produced in the energy creation process. Nuclear energy is completely self-contained and produces no airborne by-products. The waste created through nuclear power is contained in the reactor and is disposed of when the vessel is decommissioned or the reactor is replaced. Unlike nuclear power plants that have to have spent fuel rods removed from their reactors every 18 to 24 months, the nuclear reactors powering the submarines and aircraft carriers of the United States Navy remain fully operational until they are decommissioned. When the reactors powering the ships of the Navy are decommissioned, all the nuclear waste is disposed of at once. =Safety record= , and since the first US nuclear-powered submarine (USS Nautilus), the United States Navy had logged over 6,200 \\"reactor years\\" with no radiological accidents.U.S. Navy Nuclear Safety Record ‚Äì statement of Admiral F. L. \\"Skip\\" Bowman, U.S. Navy Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program before the House Committee on Science 29 October 2003 However, on 22 May 1978 on , a valve was mistakenly opened releasing up to 100 US gallons of radioactive water into a drydock at Puget Sound naval base. The leak was fully contained and there was no personnel irradiation.https://fas.org/wp- content/uploads/2014/05/NavalAccidents1945-1988.pdf Nuclear propulsion career types In order to safely operate the fleet of nuclear-powered vessels, the U.S. Navy recruits and trains the men and women who serve in the Navy Nuclear Propulsion community. There are careers for Officers, requiring a minimum of a college degree, and there are Enlisted careers requiring a minimum of a high school diploma or equivalent. =Officers= Because of the rigorous training that Navy Nuclear Officers undergo, only a select group of individuals are given the opportunity to lead a crew and command this technologically advanced equipment. Careers as an Officer in Navy Nuclear Propulsion include: Submarine officers They oversee the day-to-day operations on board a submarine. They ensure that all systems run smoothly, including the nuclear reactor and nuclear propulsion system, weapons systems, and atmosphere control and fire control systems. They are also responsible for driving the vessel and charting its position and operating communications and intelligence equipment. Surface warfare officers (nuclear) Nuclear Surface Warfare Officers oversee the day-to-day operations of a nuclear- powered aircraft carrier and conventional war ships, managing everything from communications and navigation to armament capabilities and tactical deployment. Nuclear Surface Warfare Officers are in charge of numerous shipboard operations and activities, from the engineering plant to the bridge. They have the responsibility of ensuring that Sailors in their division maintain and operate the ship's complex systems. Naval reactors engineers Naval Reactors (NR) is a government office that has responsibility for all shipboard nuclear power plants, shore-based prototypes and nuclear propulsion support facilities for the Navy. Naval Reactors Engineers assume responsibility for key technical work in a variety of facilities, including: *Two Department of Energy laboratories *Two nuclear prototype/training sites *Nearly 100 nuclear-powered ships and submarines *Six shipyards *More than 1,000 firms that support the Naval Reactors program Naval Nuclear Power School instructors Naval Nuclear Power School Instructors train the future Navy Nuclear community through a technologically advanced curriculum that is taught with a sole purpose in mind: to prepare Navy Enlisted Sailors and Officers attending Nuclear Power School in Goose Creek, SC, for their work in the nuclear power field. They provide detailed knowledge of how to work the key aspects of a pressurized-water Navy nuclear power plant, which include: *Reactor core nuclear principles *Heat transfer and fluid systems *Plant chemistry and materials *Mechanical and electrical systems *Radiological control Navy Nuclear Propulsion Officer Candidate (NUPOC) Program For current undergraduate students who meet the high academic standards and prerequisite background, especially those pursuing majors such as mathematics, engineering, physics or chemistry, the NUPOC program provides money to eligible candidates to complete their undergraduate or graduate degree as well as a regular monthly income while in school. The pay amount varies based on location, but is usually in the range of $4000‚Äì5500 per month. There is also a one-time $15,000 bonus for getting accepted for Submarine, Surface, and Naval Reactors Engineer positions. After obtaining their degree, individuals earn a commission in the Navy and pursue one of the Officer career paths in Navy Nuclear Propulsion. While in NUPOC, students have no special uniforms, classes, or obligations day-to-day. They must, however, refrain from drug use and pass a physical fitness test every six months. Students in NUPOC are considered \\"Active Duty\\" and paid at the E-6 or E-7 paygrade. As such, time spent completing a degree accrues for purposes of Naval Retirement and VA benefits such as the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Basic qualifications The NUPOC program is open to both men and women. Depending on career focus, the eligibility requirements have minor variances. There are criteria that one must meet regardless of the focus. Candidates must: *Be a U.S. citizen *Meet the physical standards of the Navy *Have a minimum age of 19 :*Submarine Officers/Surface Warfare Officers must be less than 31 years of age :*Naval Reactors Engineers/Nuclear Power School Instructors must be less than 35 years of age Education: Candidates must be graduates or students of an accredited college or university in the United States or a United States territory holding or pursuing a BA, BS or MS (preferably majoring in mathematics, engineering, physics, chemistry or another technical area) and must have: *Completed one academic year of calculus *Completed one academic year of calculus-based physics *Have a competitive GPA (Depending on the desired career, minimum grade requirements exist for all technical courses) =Enlisted= Members of the Navy Nuclear community operate, control and maintain the components that power Navy aircraft carriers and submarines. This could involve doing anything from operating nuclear propulsion plant machinery to controlling auxiliary equipment that supports Naval reactors to maintaining the electronic equipment used to send and receive messages, detect enemy planes and ships, and determine target distances. Machinist's Mates (MM) operate and maintain steam turbines and reduction gears used for ship propulsion and auxiliary machinery such as turbogenerators, pumps and oil purifiers. They also maintain auxiliary machinery outside of main machinery spaces, such as electrohydraulic steering engines and elevators, refrigeration plants, air conditioning systems and desalinization plants. They may also operate and maintain compressed gas-producing plants. Nuclear-trained Enlisted Sailors perform duties in nuclear propulsion plants operating reactor controls and propulsion and power generation systems. Electrician's Mates (EM) are responsible for the operation of a ship's electrical power generation systems, lighting systems, electrical equipment and electrical appliances. The duties include installation, operation, adjustment, routine maintenance, inspection, test and repair of electrical equipment. EMs also perform maintenance and repair of related electronic equipment. Electronics Technicians (ET) in the nuclear field are normally assigned to Reactor Control division. They are responsible for maintenance, repair and operation of equipment that is closely related to the nuclear reactor and reactor safety. Qualifications To be eligible for any Nuclear Operations career, a candidate must first be selected for nuclear training by scoring above the minimum requirements on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) and must: *Be a U.S. citizen *Be less than 25 years of age at the time of enlistment *Be able to meet the physical standards of the Navy *Be a high school graduate with a diploma and successful completion of one year of algebra *Be able to meet security clearance requirements References External links *http://www.navy.com/careers/nuclear-energy.html *http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/bowman031029.txt *http://www.history.navy.mil/bios/rickover.htm *http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/carriers/carriers.asp *http://www.facebook.com/NavyNuclear *http://www.navy.mil/navydata/ships/subs/subs.asp *http://www.hss.energy.gov/nuclearsafety/env/ Category:United States Navy ","title":"United States Navy Nuclear Propulsion"},{"id":"32022912","text":"The Monastery of the Precious Blood is a building in southeast Portland, Oregon, United States, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

With its large windows, tall brick walls, and decorative brick work, it is a site to behold, and knowing that it was build in 1913 makes it even more spectacular. It was built by Portland Native Architect Ellis Lawrence.  Architecture  The Troy Laundry building is classified as a colonial revival architecture buildingUnited States Department of the Interior; National Register of Historic Places Registration form. Troy Laundry Building. Federal Register No.: 10024-0018 (January 27, 1989), but other aspects of architecture is seen throughout it. The towering brick work with the tall, double layered windows is an example of this. As well as the decorative brick work in even intervals high upon the walls. Renaissance revival architecture drew inspiration from a wide range of classical Italian modes.Roth, Leland M., and Amanda C. R. Clark. American Architecture: a History. Routledge, 2019.Nineteenth century architects and critics gained inspiration from rich things as early fifteenth century expression artwork and architecture; they also included styles such as Baroque and Mannerist. The divergent forms of Renaissance architecture in different parts of Europe make it difficult to define and recognize new, or Neo-Renaissance, architecture. The building also has aspects of Egyptian Revival architecture. Such architecture has motifs and imagery that resemble that of ancient EgyptRoth, Leland. High stone walls and angular features are the key designs for this. The angular wall faces and design of the upper portions of the Troy Laundry building are excellent depictions of such stylistic choice. Public awareness is often attributed to Napoleon‚Äôs conquest of Egypt and the defeat of the French Navy at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. Even during Napoleon‚Äôs scientific expedition in Egypt, the monumental size of their architecture is noted in the publication of the trip.McAlester, V., Matty, S. P., &amp; Clicque, S. (2018). A field guide to American houses: The definitive guide to identifying and understanding America's domestic architecture. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. Colonial Revival architecture can be attributed to angular brickwork, small stacked windows, and symmetrical features, all of which can be seen on the Troy Laundry Building. Colonial Revival style is often associated with Centennial Exhibitions, which reawakened Americans to the architectural traditions of the colonial past.Roth, LelandIt wasn‚Äôt until 1910 that the Colonial Revival movement really took in American society, where forty percent of United States homes built during the subsequent twenty year period were built in this style.

Tait came to Portland from Scotland, where he had apprenticed in the laundry tradeUnited States Department of the Interior; National Register of Historic Places Registration form. Troy Laundry Building. Federal Register No.: 10024-0018 (January 27, 1989). His knowledge of the business and his spectacular management skills led to the establishment of a successful and one of the longest running laundry businesses in the city of Portland. The original Troy Laundry building was located on the west side of the river, but was destroyed by a fire in 1984.

In 1892, Tait ran advertisements for the laundry which showed how large his operation was; he even had places where laundry could be picked up throughout Portland, Vancouver, and Oregon City. Troy Laundry was one of two large laundries which catered to both commercial and individual clientsDept. of Interior. Within in twenty five years Tait and his company expanded greatly. His staff increased to over one hundred fifty people. By 1913, the laundry had outgrown its earlier building, and the Troy Laundry building was built. Then, at the corner of 10th and Pine. Tait was one of the first people in the laundry industry to switch to an eight-hour work day. The new building incorporated a variety of innovative features: a large employee dining room and lounge, its own electrical generators, new engines that ran forty four washers, and twenty two extractors. It had the, then, standard oil burner dryers and steam equipment, but also housed the new drying system, the tumbler; this technology was considered revolutionary at the time. Tait‚Äôs system allowed his business to handle over six hundred thousand dollars worth of work a week; his business represented a customer base of ten thousand residential, industrial, and commercial clients. = Ellis F. Lawrence = Ellis F. Lawrence was born in Malden, Massachusetts in 1879Ellis Fuller Lawrence Papers. He received his Bachelor‚Äôs and Master‚Äôs degrees in architecture from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which was the first school of architecture in the United States. After graduating in 1902, Lawrence worked for three architectural firms: Codman and Despradelle, Andrews Jacques and Rantoul, and John Calvin Stevens. Lawrence was greatly influenced by his work with Despradelle, his former studio instructor, as well as John Calvin Stevens. In 1906 Lawrence headed west where he intended to open an office in San Francisco. He stopped in Portland, Oregon along the way to visit a friend and former M.I.T graduate. It was then that Lawrence decided to move to Portland. He joined his friend, E.B. McNaughton, and engineer Henry Raymond in partnership in November 1906.University of Oregon Libraries.‚Äù University of Oregon Libraries, library.uoregon.edu/architecture/oregon/lawrence.[1] Lawrence was their chief designer. In February of 1910 Lawrence left the firm to pursue independent work until 1913. A former classmate and friend from M.I.T. William G. Holdford joined him in partnership. Ormond Bean and Fred Allyn joined that partnership in 1928. Bean left the firm in 1933, and both Allyn and Holdford left in 1940. Lawrence‚Äôs first design in Portland was his home located in the Irvington neighborhood of Northeast Portland. In 1914 Lawrence founded the University of Oregon School of Architecture and Allied Arts in Eugene, Oregon. He organized the school around teaching methods which rejected the traditional philosophy. He believed in integration of all the arts. Lawrence eventually became acquainted with many of the Portland‚Äôs most influential businessmen; Like John Tait. He also knew many nationally known figures such as Frank Lloyd Wright, and the Olmstead brothers. National Register of Historic Places; Multiple Property Documentation form. Architecture of Ellis F.

Initially, there were three known storms during the season, but a re-analysis confirmed the increased activity. There were also two other systems that were included as tropical cyclones at one time, although both were considered to have been other storms already in the database. All tropical activity occurred between the middle of July and the end of October. There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season. Meteorologist Christopher Landsea estimates that up to six storms were missed from the official database, due to small tropical cyclone size, sparse ship reports, and relatively unpopulated coastlines. Every storm but the fourth hurricane affected land during the season. The first hurricane hit Matagorda, Texas in July, the only one of the season to hit the United States as a hurricane. A month later a hurricane made two landfalls in Mexico. The third hurricane of the season formed near Bermuda and was last observed along the southern coast of Newfoundland. A few weeks later another storm executed a similar track, although it struck Newfoundland as a hurricane and caused damage. The most notable storm of the season was the Great Nassau Hurricane, which killed at least 383 people in the Turks and Caicos, Bahamas, and the western Atlantic Ocean. It attained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h), which is a Category 4 on the modern-day Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The final hurricane developed over the Bahamas and later struck New Jersey, producing strong winds and high tides across New England.

As the hurricane moved westward, it remained a short distance off the Gulf Coast of the United States, bringing strong winds to New Orleans on July 12\\\\. High tides surrounded the lighthouse at Timbalier Bay for about 24 hours, prompting the lighthouse keeper to resign from loneliness and from fear of the weather. On July 15, the hurricane moved ashore near Matagorda Bay in Texas, with winds estimated around 105 mph (165 km/h), or a Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. At landfall, the minimum barometric pressure was estimated at 969 mbar (28.61 inHg). The hurricane's strong winds broke all of the boats from their moorings in the Matagorda harbor. Four ships were either lost or wrecked, and one schooner was washed ashore. The storm dissipated early on July 16 after progressing further inland. =Hurricane Two= On August 13, a ship encountered a severe hurricane in the eastern Caribbean Sea. Based on observations, it is estimated the hurricane attained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h). There were no reports for several days, although based on continuity it is estimated the storm passed south of Jamaica on August 15\\\\. The following day, the hurricane struck the eastern Yucat√°n Peninsula, washing seven boats ashore. It is estimated to have weakened to a tropical storm while moving over land, although the system re-intensified into a hurricane in the Bay of Campeche. It made its second and final landfall near Veracruz before dissipating on August 18. =Hurricane Three= The third hurricane of the season was first encountered on September 4 by a ship north of Bermuda; the vessel sustained damage to its foretopmast. The storm affected another ship later that day, leaving similar heavy damage. Tracking generally northeastward, the hurricane was last observed on September 7 near Newfoundland. =Hurricane Four= On September 18 and for two days subsequently, a barque sailed through a hurricane near the Cape Verde islands. The vessel was en route from New York to Shanghai, but due to a leak from the storm it had to return to New York for repairs. Aside from a single reported location, the track of the hurricane is unknown. Winds were estimated around . =Hurricane Five= A ship named \\"Honduras\\" observed the fifth hurricane of the season on September 22 to the south-southeast of Nova Scotia. The ship lost its masts and sails from the storm, and based on the observations the winds were estimated around 105 mph (165 km/h). Additional ship reports indicated the hurricane maintained a northeast track toward Newfoundland. Late on September 23, the hurricane made landfall in south-central Newfoundland, although it quickly weakened to tropical storm intensity. The winds spread across much of the island, severing the telegraphs in and around St. John's. Late on September 24, the storm was last observed to the north of the island. Around August 14, the emigrant bark Laura left Bremen en route to Baltimore, Maryland. According to a contemporary account in the Baltimore Sun, \\"She reports having encountered a hurricane on the 22d September, shipping a tremendous sea, which washed overboard seven passengers and one of the crew, besides slightly injuring fifty others.\\"\\"Marine Disaster--A Baltimore Bound Emigrant Ship has Eight Persons Washed Overboard,\\" Baltimore Sun, October 4, 1866. =Hurricane Six= The Great Nassau Hurricane of 1866 or The Great Bahamas Hurricane of 1866 was the sixth hurricane of the season and was also the longest-lasting. The brig Jarien encountered the hurricane on September 24 to the west-southwest of the Cape Verde islands. The track is unknown for the following five days, until another ship reported a hurricane about 20 miles (32 km) north of Anegada in the British Virgin Islands. The hurricane affected the Leeward Islands, washing several ships ashore and destroying a pier in St. Thomas. On September 30 through the following day, the cyclone moved through the Turks and Caicos Islands, becoming what was considered \\"one of the most terrific hurricanes ever known\\". About 75% of the population was left homeless and moneyless. After affecting the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane passed through the Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938 mbar (27.70 inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h). The hurricane struck without warning in the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October 4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force 11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October 5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383 people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes. =Tropical Storm Seven= The final storm of the season was first observed on October 28 over the Bahamas, and may have been a hybrid or subtropical cyclone. It moved north-northwestward through the island chain, followed by a turn to the north-northeast over the western Atlantic. Several ships encountered the tropical storm, and one lost their supply of molasses. On October 30, the cyclone, at the time transitioning to extratropical, struck on the southern end of Long Beach Island with winds of 70 mph (110 km/h). As it moved through the northeastern United States, the storm dropped heavy rainfall, causing flooding near Jersey City and Hoboken, New Jersey.

The rebellion was led by the al-Atrash family, in an aim to gain independence, but ended in brutal suppression of the Druze, significant depopulation of the Hauran region and execution of the Druze leaders. Background The Hauran is a volcanic plateau, located in southwestern Syria and extending into the northwestern corner of modern-day Jordan. The area includes the Golan Heights on the west, and is bounded there by the Jordan Rift Valley; it also includes Jabal ad- Duruz area in the east, and is bounded there by more arid steppe and desert terrains. With the advent of the Ottoman Turks and the conquest of Syria by Sultan Selim I in 1516, the Druze Ma'ans were acknowledged by the new rulers as the feudal lords of southern mount Lebanon. Druze villages spread and prospered in that region, which under Ma'an leadership so flourished that it acquired the generic term of Jabal Bayt-Ma'an (the mountain of the Ma'an family) or Jabal al-Druze. The latter title has since been usurped by the Hauran region, which since the middle of the 19th century has proven a haven of refuge to Druze emigrants from Mount Lebanon, and has become the headquarters of Druze power Origins of the Druze People and Religion, by Philip K. Hitti, 1924 The Druze family of Al-Atrash had nominally governed the region of Suwayda since 1879. Following the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the spread of taxation, elections and conscription, to areas already undergoing economic change caused by the construction of new railroads, provoked large revolts, particularly among the Druzes of the Hauran.Schsenwald, William L. \\"The Vilayet of Syria, 1901-1914: A Re-Examination of Diplomatic Documents As Sources.\\" Middle East Journal (1968), Vol 22, No. 1, Winter: p. 73. Rebellion Sami Pasha al-Faruqi's troops used in the Druze rebellion near Daraa railway station. The rebellion in Hauran erupted in May 1909, when a business dispute between Druze chief Yahia bey Atrash in the village of Busra al-Harir escalated into a clash of arms between the Druze and Ottoman-backed local villagers. A year of truce attempts followed, but failed to achieve any stability in the area and prompting an Ottoman response. Sami Pasha al-Farouqi arrived in Damascus in August 1910, leading an Ottoman expeditionary force of some 35 battalions, and began advancing on Druze positions on 18 or 19 September. the first battle took place on 1-2 October, where the Druze were compelled to retreat. A second battle was fought on 12 October, where the government won another victory. By 8 November, the rebellion had disintegrated. Sami Pasha al-Farouqi arrived in Damascus in August 1910, leading an Ottoman expeditionary force of some 35 battalions, Though the Druze recognized their inferiority against such a force, several clashes followed. Zuqan al-Atrash led a fierce battle against the Ottomans near al-Kafr, where he faced the forces of Sami Pasha al-Farouqi. After engaging Ottoman troops in two villages the Druze resistance collapsed. Sami Pasha used military force and trickery and succeeded in occupying the whole Jabal el-Druze. The rebellion ended with massive casualties among the Druze inhabitants of the Hauran, reaching as much as 10% of the population. The number of killed is put at 2,000 with a similar number of wounded and hundreds of imprisoned, taken into custody in Damascus and Acre. This led to significant depopulation of entire areas within the region. Zuqan, the leader of the revolt, was captured and later executed in 1911 (some sources place his execution in 1910). Aftermath Following the collapse of the Druze revolt, al-Farouqi launched a campaign to disarm the Druze population - some 10,000 rifles were collected. Al-Farouqi also performed a census of the Hauran area, ordering 200,000 cards from Istanbul for the purpose. Taxes were collected and arrears in cattle extracted when taxation was not available. Furthermore, one thousand Druze were conscripted into the Ottoman army and scattered throughout the empire. The Druze campaign of 1910 became a starting point to cancel a \\"policy of exceptions\\" in Ottoman Syria, later implementing similar measures in Jabal Ajlun, as well as during the Karak revolt in Transjordan. During the First World War, the Ottomans left Jabal al-Druze in peace as they feared rebellion. Sultan al-Atrash, son of Zuqan al-Atrash, was then able to get in touch with Pan-Arab movements and especially with the Arab Revolt in Hijaz. When Arab forces reached Aqaba, he sent a thousand men to join the revolt. He joined them himself with another 300 men, when they reached Bosra. His forces were the first to enter Damascus and raise the Arab flag on the government house on September 29, 1918. Sultan al-Atrash was in good relations with the Hashemite Emir Faisal, leader of the Arab forces in the revolt. Sultan was awarded the title of Emir and the rank of a General in the Syrian army, the equivalent of the title of Pasha. In 1920, al-Atrash family was supporting the short-living Arab Kingdom of Syria, which was re-occupied by France after the Battle of Maysalun on July 24, 1920. Sultan al-Atrash was gathering his men to fight the French, but the quick succession of events cut his efforts short, as French forces entered Damascus and the country was divided into five states, State of Souaida (later Jabal al-Druze state) being one of them. Sultan al-Atrash would later become the rebel commander of the Druze War against the French Mandate between 1925 and 1927, and would remain a prominent figure in Syrian politics, despite the utter defeat of the Druze War.

Their surname is sometimes given as Pizigano (only one 'z') in older sources.  1367 Chart  The 1367 chart of the Pizzigani brothers. (Full 10 MB Version) The Pizzigani brothers are principally known for the construction of a portolan chart, signed and dated 1367, currently held by the Biblioteca Palatina of Parma (Ms.Parm.1612). Measuring 138 by 92 cm, it is one of the largest maps of that era. There is some controversy over the authorship. The note on the edge of the map, states (in one reading): \\"\\"MCCCLXVII. Hoc opus compoxuid franciscus pizigano veneciar et domnus pizigano In Venexia meffecit marcus die XII decembris.\\". The common assumption is that this refers to two brothers, Francesco Pizzigano and Domenico Pizzigano. Among the various alternative hypothesis is that Francesco was the son of Domenico, rather than his brother (and that Domenico might be dead by this date); that 'domnus' is a title for a priest, that the proper first name of the second author is Marco, that a close reading of the authorship note seems more like 'rardus' ‚Äì or (Ge)rardus, Gerardo; that there might be three brothers (Francesco, Domenico, Marco/Gerardo), etc.For details, see Longhena (1907, 1927). It was customary to refer to the brothers as the Pizigani (one z), until the discovery of the 1424 map of Zuane Pizzigano in the 20th century suggested a re-spelling to a double z.e.g. Astengo (2007) The Pizzigani portolan of 1367 is notable for going beyond the normal geographical boundaries of contemporary maps (Mediterranean and Black Seas) to include large swathes of the Atlantic Ocean, the northerly Scandinavian peninsula and the Baltic and Caspian Seas. Atlantic islands off coast of Africa in 1367 map The 1367 Pizzigani chart gives an expanded depiction of the Canary Islands, showing eight of them, reflecting the knowledge accumulated since the 1339 Angelino Dulcert chart. It also includes the fantasy islands of Brasil (in the open ocean, with ships and dragons of Arab legend depicted around it). North of the real Canaries, the Pizzigani brothers also depicted a fictional cluster of Fortunate Islands, intended to capture Saint Brendan's Island, graced by an image of Brendan himself in monastic garb. The Pizzigani map is also the first in which the mythical Isle of Mam (southwest of Ireland) makes its first appearance. Inscription of Antillia/Hercules in 1367 map. Some historians once believed the legendary island of Antillia, made famous in many 15th-century portolan charts, was first insinuated cartographically in the 1367 Pizigani brothers chart. On the western edge of the map, although there is no island depicted or mentioned, there is a disk with a picture of a man with hand outstretched, and an inscription, which some have read as saying \\"Here are statues which stand before the shores of Atullia (ante ripas Atulliae) and which have been set up for the safety of sailors; for beyond is the vile sea, which sailors cannot navigate\\".as cited in Crone (1938: p.260) Some scholars, especially in the 19th century, believed this Atullia was the first reference to \\"Antillia\\" on a map (e.g. Buache, Kretschmer, Nordenski√∂ld)Jean-Nicholas Buache (1806: p.25-26), Konrad Kretschmer (1892: 195-7), A.E. Nordenski√∂ld (1897: p.164). but this reading has been doubted since. Crone (1938) read it as ante ripas Getuliae (Getulia).Crone (1938). Although Crone later (1947) considers other readings. Beginning with Hennig (1945), the inscription has been commonly read as at temps Arcules or ante templum Arcules (from the time/temple of Hercules).,Hennig (1945). This reading is acknowledged by Crone (1947) and embraced by Armando Cortes√£o (1954 (1975) , p.106]) almost doubtlessly a reference to the Pillars of Hercules, the non-plus ultra of ancient navigation, as transmitted via Arab sources, e.g. al-Masudi speaks of the \\"copper idols\\" of \\"King Hercules the Giant\\" marking the edge of the Green Sea of Darkness,Beazley (1897, Vol. I p.465. al-Idrisi places the marker 'idols' on islands away from the straits.Crone (1938: p.262). Crone (1937) notes the elasticity of the exact location of Hercules's pillars in 15th- century charts. Cortes√£o (1954 (1975):p.74) notes that an inscription about Hercules's \\"statues\\" to mark the edge of safe navigation was common practice in Arab charts. The 1367 map also provides one of the first clear European depictions of the legendary \\"River of Gold\\" in west Africa.Formally, its depiction of the \\"River of Gold\\" is preceded by the 1351 Laurentian Medici Atlas, but the dating of the Medici atlas is very dubious and elastic, and maybe later than the Pizzigani brothers. This is the \\"western Nile\\" described by Arabic sources, notably the geographers al-Bakri and al-Idrisi. The western Nile is essentially the Senegal River and the Niger River, which were long assumed to be connected to each other, flowing through the gold-producing heart of the Mali Empire. The Pizzigani brothers called it the \\"Palolus\\" river, and place its source at a large lake in the \\"Mountains of the Moon\\" in the east (from which the Egyptian Nile was also believed to stem).Major (1868: p.112) The Pizzigani show the river running west, pouring into the Atlantic Ocean somewhere south of \\"Caput finis Gozola\\" (Cape Non). The Pizzigani brothers place the actual gold mines on a river island which they call the \\"island of Palola\\" (probably the Bur√© gold district, which surrounded by branches of the upper Niger River, was mistaken for a river island). The Pizzigani map also makes note of the legend of Prester John, noting that so much gold was found there, that it was even used to tile the roofs of houses and forge the weapons of his soldiers.Russell (2000: p.122)  Other charts  In addition to the 1367 chart (Biblioteca Palatina, Parma, Ms.Parm.1612), the Pizzigani brothers are believed to be responsible for four other maps: * (Domenico Pizzigano alone): small map of Palestine and Syria, dated 1350, facsimile held by the Biblioth√®que nationale de France in Paris (Ge F 2428).For the reference, see BNF citation.

After World Blues dwindled, Ernest formed another club band with Teddy Royal called Cypress. Ernest played for years at the Sea-Saint studios with Allen Toussaint among others. In 2005, before Hurricane Katrina he was working on Nine Lives with Paul Sanchez. He began recording with Dr. John in the early 1990s, and became a member of the band after the recording of Trippin' Live in 1996. Shortly after that he became the bandleader and remained a key member until his death, providing a \\"sturdy foundation.\\" \\"Their rapport, honed over many years together and the result of a profound mutual respect, was obvious in Mr. Ernest‚Äôs humorous introductions and commentaries delivered from behind the drum kit.

He was ruler of the Principality of Grubenhagen. He was the second son of Duke Albert II of Grubenhagen and his wife Elizabeth, n√©e Countess of Waldeck. Philip was the last member of the Grubenhagen line to use the title Duke of Brunswick. His successors used the title Duke of Brunswick and L√ºneburg, like most other princes of the House of Guelph. After his father's death in 1485, he was first under the guardianship of his cousin Henry IV and his mother Elisabeth. As early as 1486 he signed deeds himself. In 1494, he took up the government of his principality. His seat, Herzberg Castle, was completely destroyed in a fire in 1510. His cousin Henry died childless in 1526 and Philip inherited Henry's part of the principality, thereby reuniting all of Grubenhagen under a single Duke for the first time since 1479. Philip was one of the first princes to follow the Reformation. He was present at the Diet of Worms in 1521 and joined the League of Torgau in 1526. In 1531, he formed, with other princes, the Schmalkaldic League. He then reformed the monasteries in his principality and in 1538, he adopted a Church order for Grubenhagen and declared the papal doctrine to be abolished. In 1546 Philip and his sons participated in a military campaign in the Schmalkaldic War in southern Germany, which ended unsuccessfully at Ingolstadt. This campaign drew the ire of Emperor Charles V. After the utter defeat of the Protestants, he was acquitted in 1548 and reinstated as Duke. After his death in 1551, he was succeeded by his son Ernest III in the government, and after Ernest's death in 1567, Ernest was succeeded by his younger brother Wolfgang. When Wolfgang died in 1595 without male offspring, he was succeeded by Philip's youngest son, Philip II. With Philip II's death without male offspring in 1596, the male line of the Grubenhagen line of the House of Guelph died out.  Marriage and issue  Philip I. was married twice.

History Construction began during the Northern Wei dynasty (368-534) and were put under periodic reconstruction during later dynasties until the Tang dynasty (618-906). The site was situated along the Silk Road, an important route for the spread of Buddhism. The influence of this trade route is apparent in the decorative motifs, with influences drawn from India and Central Asia. Prior to the construction of the grottoes, the area was known as Fengyishan. The Site A Buddha at the Grottoes The site has been subdivided into 5 scenic sites: Dafo Tower, Zisun Palace, Yuanguang Temple, Xiangguo Temple and Taohua Cave. Within the grottoes, statues, wall paintings and inscribed stelae can be found. Carved into red sandstone cliffs, many of the caves have little to no decorative elements. It is thought that the grottoes may have served to house monks. The site's most iconic element is a 65-foot depiction of the seated future Buddha. While the Buddha is currently protected by a large fence, it has been subjected to erosion and improper conservation. Threats While the area has been protected by China since 1982 as a National Level Cultural Relic Protected Site, there are many threats to its survival. The caves are threatened by exposure to the elements (particularly wind and sand erosion), earthquakes, looting, vandalism and insufficient management. The site has been listed among the top 100 endangered architectural and cultural sites in the world. Additionally, improper architectural conservation techniques have been employed at the site, including the use of cement on the seated Buddha in 1982.

The Japanese Friendship Garden, also known as San Kei En ( ‰∏âÊ∏ìÂúí ) is a Japanese Garden within Balboa Park, San Diego. It is an expression of friendship between San Diego and its sister city Yokohama that binds the two cultures to create a unique experience for visitors from all over the world. Representing a new concept in the development of a Japanese garden outside Japan, the Japanese Friendship Garden is designed to present an atmosphere of elegant simplicity (shibui) and quiet beauty. The design is guided by the original principles of the Japanese garden while incorporating elements of the regional landscape and climate. A garden is always in a state of change but the basic elements of trees, shrubs, rocks and water designed in natural balance create a peaceful, harmonious, and transcendental environment conducive to contemplation and meditation. History =Japanese Tea Pavilion 1914‚Äì1941= In Balboa Park the year 1915, San Diego opened its Panama-California Exposition. Designed to call attention to San Diego and bolster the economy, the Exposition highlighted archaeological and anthropological displays as well as advertised the agricultural potential of the southwest. One of the popular exhibits was a Japanese \\"Teahouse\\" built just north of the Botanical Building in an area that is now occupied by the Children's Zoo. The Teahouse was a one-story building with an open veranda where visitors to the Exposition could sit, sip tea, and enjoy a garden landscaped in a manner few had seen other than from photos of Japan. There was a Japanese Garden adjacent to the \\"Teahouse\\" which could be described as plants, stone lanterns, bronze cranes, and a winding stream squeezed into a small space so small that everything was foreground. While the garden lacked a sense of depth or borrowing of scenery (\\"shakkei\\"), details were carefully executed by the gardeners who were well versed in the techniques of bonsai and ikebana. The overall harmony of elements was sacrificed as effects were compressed for space. In Japan there are often fences or walls surrounding the Garden, but in Balboa Park at that time, there was neither fence nor wall to help create and define areas or moods. For nearly 30 years, the Teahouse and garden were operated and maintained by the Asakawa family, who continue to this day as active members of the San Diego community. Though a symbol of the strong cultural and commercial ties that linked the two nations, the Teahouse and garden were eventually closed. =Garden Restoration 1955‚Äì1990= In 1955, key citizens of San Diego gathered, and formulated a plan for restoring a Japanese garden in Balboa Park on an expanded site. As the first tangible symbol of this effort, the City of Yokohama presented the City of San Diego with a snow lantern in 1956. Following that in 1958, they presented the Friendship Bell, which can now be found on Shelter Island. The San Diego Yokohama Sister City Society, whose members worked with the City of San Diego to identify the current site of the garden, acquired a Japanese Gate. They installed it just to the north of the Organ Pavilion. In. 1968, they dedicated the gate as the Charles C. Dail Memorial Japanese Gate in order to honor the commitment by the people of San Diego. The gate was near the entrance to the set aside in Balboa Park, the eventual construction and restoration site of a Japanese garden. In 1977, after hearing the plans by many San Diegans to reestablish a Japanese garden, Yokohama gave San Diego 100 cherry blossom trees that now blossom at the Wild Animal Park. During 1977 and 1978, a series of public conferences were held to make plans for the new garden. These events allowed the general public to get involved in the designing of Balboa's new garden. The next step was to design a master plan. For this task, the Society called upon the architectural firm of Fong & LaRocca Associates. Takeo Uesugi, the Landscape Architect and Japanese Garden Design Consultant, was to help them in planning and designing the garden. In 1979 the Department of Parks & Recreation and the City Council's Public Facilities & Recreation Committee approved the Japanese Garden Master Plan for Balboa Park. The Society had a professional feasibility study completed to determine if sufficient financial support was available. Not only did funds have to be identified from San Diego, but also from a sources throughout the United States and Japan. The study showed that support for the project was strong, so with the cooperation of Mayor Pete Wilson and the City of San Diego, the new Japanese Friendship Garden was under way. In 1985, Landscape Architect Takeshi Ken Nakajima named the garden San-Kei-En, which means garden of three types of scenery‚Äîpastoral, mountain, and lake. The initial Master Plan was designed so that garden could be constructed in five phases, with the first opening in August 1990. While planning for the second phase, the Master Plan was changed and the phase system was discontinued. =Garden Improvement Project 1990‚Äì1999= Yamabuki Ogon koi and reflections in pond. In September 1999 a major Improvement Project was completed. The design team for this project was led by landscape architect Professor Takeo Uesugi. The Improvement Project included: *Plaza at the upper entrance of the garden including a Tea Pavilion. *Garden Study Center to focus on the skill and techniques of Japanese gardening. *Expanded and enhanced entire upper garden. *Expanded garden staff. *10,700 gallon koi pond and waterfall. *Bonsai Garden. The improvement project took two years of planning. The Garden was closed to the public for approximately six months and re-opened September 21, 1999. =Garden Improvement Project Third Phase= Completed in 2015, the third phase of the improvement project comprised 9 additional acres which included a 200 cherry tree grove, large azalea and camellia garden, a water feature reminiscent of the San Diego watershed, and the state of the art Inamori Pavilion.

The law of large numbers of classical probability theory states that sums of independent random variables are, under very mild conditions, close to their expectation with a large probability. Such sums are the most basic examples of random variables concentrated around their mean. Recent results show that such behavior is shared by other functions of independent random variables. Concentration inequalities can be sorted according to how much information about the random variable is needed in order to use them. Markov's inequality Let X be a random variable that is non-negative (almost surely). Then, for every constant a > 0, : \\\\Pr(X \\\\geq a) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}(X)}{a}. Note the following extension to Markov's inequality: if \\\\Phi is a strictly increasing and non-negative function, then :\\\\Pr(X \\\\geq a) = \\\\Pr(\\\\Phi (X) \\\\geq \\\\Phi (a)) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}(\\\\Phi(X))}{\\\\Phi (a)}.  Chebyshev's inequality  Chebyshev's inequality requires the following information on a random variable X: * The expected value \\\\operatorname{E}[X] is finite. * The variance \\\\operatorname{Var}[X] = \\\\operatorname{E}[(X - \\\\operatorname{E}[X] )^2] is finite. Then, for every constant a > 0, :\\\\Pr(X-\\\\operatorname{E}[X] \\\\geq a) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{Var}[X]}{a^2}, or equivalently, :\\\\Pr(X-\\\\operatorname{E}[X] \\\\geq a\\\\cdot \\\\operatorname{Std}[X]) \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{a^2}, where \\\\operatorname{Std}[X] is the standard deviation of X. Chebyshev's inequality can be seen as a special case of the generalized Markov's inequality applied to the random variable X-\\\\operatorname{E}[X] with \\\\Phi(x) = x^2.  Vysochanskij‚ÄìPetunin inequality   Paley‚ÄìZygmund inequality   Cantelli's inequality   Gauss's inequality  Chernoff bounds The generic Chernoff bound requires only the moment generating function of X, defined as: M_X(t) := \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\\\\\!\\\\left[e^{tX}\\\\right], provided it exists. Based on Markov's inequality, for every t>0: :\\\\Pr(X \\\\geq a) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[e^{t\\\\cdot X}]}{e^{t\\\\cdot a}}, and for every t<0: :\\\\Pr(X \\\\leq a) \\\\leq \\\\frac{\\\\operatorname{E}[e^{t\\\\cdot X}]}{e^{t\\\\cdot a}}. There are various Chernoff bounds for different distributions and different values of the parameter t. See for a compilation of more concentration inequalities.  Bounds on sums of independent variables  Let X_1, X_2,\\\\dots,X_n be independent random variables such that, for all i: :a_i\\\\leq X_i\\\\leq b_i almost surely. :c_i := b_i-a_i :\\\\forall i: c_i \\\\leq C Let S_n be their sum, E_n its expected value and V_n its variance: :S_n := \\\\sum_{i=1}^n X_i :E_n := \\\\operatorname{E}[S_n] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\operatorname{E}[X_i] :V_n := \\\\operatorname{Var}[S_n] = \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\operatorname{Var}[X_i] It is often interesting to bound the difference between the sum and its expected value. Several inequalities can be used. 1\\\\. Hoeffding's inequality says that: ::\\\\Pr\\\\left[S_n-E_n>t\\\\right] < 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2} \\\\right)< 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2t^2}{n C^2} \\\\right) 2\\\\. The random variable S_n- E_n is a special case of a martingale, and S_0-E_0=0. Hence, Azuma's inequality can also be used and it yields a similar bound: ::\\\\Pr\\\\left[S_n- E_n>t\\\\right] < 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{t^2}{2\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2}\\\\right)< 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{t^2}{2 n C^2} \\\\right) This is a generalization of Hoeffding's since it can handle other types of martingales, as well as supermartingales and submartingales. 3\\\\. The sum function, S_n=f(X_1,\\\\dots,X_n), is a special case of a function of n variables. This function changes in a bounded way: if variable i is changed, the value of f changes by at most b_i-a_i. Hence, McDiarmid's inequality can also be used and it yields a similar bound: ::\\\\Pr\\\\left[S_n-E_n>t\\\\right] < 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2t^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n c_i^2} \\\\right)< 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{2t^2}{n C^2} \\\\right) This is a different generalization of Hoeffding's since it can handle other functions besides the sum function, as long as they change in a bounded way. 4\\\\. Bennett's inequality offers some improvement over Hoeffding's when the variances of the summands are small compared to their almost-sure bounds C. It says that: ::\\\\Pr\\\\left[S_n-E_n > t \\\\right] \\\\leq 2\\\\exp\\\\left[ - \\\\frac{V_n}{C^2} h\\\\left(\\\\frac{C t}{V_n} \\\\right)\\\\right], where h(u) = (1+u)\\\\log(1+u)-u 5\\\\. The first of Bernstein's inequalities says that: ::\\\\Pr\\\\left[S_n-E_n>t\\\\right] < 2 \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{t^2/2}{V_n + C\\\\cdot t/3} \\\\right) This is a generalization of Hoeffding's since it can handle random variables with not only almost-sure bound but both almost-sure bound and variance bound. 6\\\\. Chernoff bounds have a particularly simple form in the case of sum of independent variables, since \\\\operatorname{E}[e^{t\\\\cdot S_n}] = \\\\prod_{i=1}^n {\\\\operatorname{E}[e^{t\\\\cdot X_i}]}. For example, suppose the variables X_i satisfy X_i \\\\geq E(X_i)-a_i-M, for 1 \\\\leq i \\\\leq n. Then we have lower tail inequality: ::\\\\Pr[S_n - E_n < -\\\\lambda]\\\\leq \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{2(V_n+\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2+M\\\\lambda/3)}\\\\right) If X_i satisfies X_i \\\\leq E(X_i)+a_i+M, we have upper tail inequality: ::\\\\Pr[S_n - E_n > \\\\lambda]\\\\leq \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{2(V_n + \\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i^2+M\\\\lambda/3)}\\\\right) If X_i are i.i.d., X_i \\\\leq 1 and \\\\sigma^2 is the variance of X_i, a typical version of Chernoff inequality is: ::\\\\Pr[S_n \\\\geq k\\\\sigma]\\\\leq 2e^{-k^2/4n} \\\\text{ for } 0 \\\\leq k\\\\leq 2\\\\sigma. 7\\\\. Similar bounds can be found in: Rademacher distribution#Bounds on sums Efron‚ÄìStein inequality The Efron‚ÄìStein inequality (or influence inequality, or MG bound on variance) bounds the variance of a general function. Suppose that X_1 \\\\dots X_n, X_1' \\\\dots X_n' are independent with X_i' and X_i having the same distribution for all i. Let X = (X_1,\\\\dots , X_n), X^{(i)} = (X_1, \\\\dots , X_{i-1}, X_i',X_{i+1}, \\\\dots , X_n). Then : \\\\mathrm{Var}(f(X)) \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} E[(f(X)-f(X^{(i)}))^2].  Dvoretzky‚ÄìKiefer‚ÄìWolfowitz inequality  The Dvoretzky‚ÄìKiefer‚ÄìWolfowitz inequality bounds the difference between the real and the empirical cumulative distribution function. Given a natural number n, let X_1, X_2,\\\\dots,X_n be real-valued independent and identically distributed random variables with cumulative distribution function F(¬∑). Let F_n denote the associated empirical distribution function defined by :F_n(x) = \\\\frac1n \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\mathbf{1}_{\\\\\\\\{X_i\\\\leq x\\\\\\\\}},\\\\qquad x\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. So F(x) is the probability that a single random variable X is smaller than x, and F_n(x) is the average number of random variables that are smaller than x. Then ::\\\\Pr\\\\left(\\\\sup_{x\\\\in\\\\mathbb R} \\\\bigl(F_n(x) - F(x)\\\\bigr) > \\\\varepsilon \\\\right) \\\\le e^{-2n\\\\varepsilon^2} \\\\text{ for every } \\\\varepsilon \\\\geq \\\\sqrt{\\\\tfrac 1 {2n} \\\\ln2}. Anti-concentration inequalities Anti- concentration inequalities, on the other hand, provide an upper bound on how much a random variable can concentrate around a quantity. For example, Rao and Yehudayoff show that there exists some C > 0 such that, for most directions of the hypercube x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}^n, the following is true: :: \\\\Pr\\\\left(\\\\langle x, Y\\\\rangle = k\\\\right) \\\\le \\\\frac{C}{\\\\sqrt{n}}, where Y is drawn uniformly from a subset B \\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{\\\\pm 1\\\\\\\\}^n of large enough size. Such inequalities are of importance in several fields, including communication complexity (e.g., in proofs of the gap Hamming problem) and graph theory. An interesting anti-concentration inequality for weighted sums of independent Rademacher random variables can be obtained using the Paley‚ÄìZygmund and the Khintchine inequalities.

The Goldenroach guerilla art and installation investigated the definition of art from the aspect of location and way of display. Kiss has engaged in several public art installations, including Ball.Room, Design Terminal, Elisabeth Park, 2016 and Just Decoration Tag Cloud in Mom Park, 2017, Budapest. In 2019 Kiss exhibited his rethought Ball.Room. installation with his in Gwangju Design Biennale Main Pavilion. In 2020 his first international solo exhibition opened in the Lottery Gallery Incheon, South Korea.  Personal life  Since 2018 Mikl√≥s Kiss has been married with photographer Eszter Sara Cseh. The extraordinary proposal, that was a disguised a guerilla art action in 2018 in MOMA, was followed by an exceptional wedding ceremony. The wedding identity design was based on manipulating some famous classical oil paintings. The faces on these iconic paintings were exchanged with the portraits of the bride and the bridegroom. The paintings were printed on canvas in the original size and the wedding started with a real exhibition opening. The wedding identity included invitation cards similar to exhibition invites, museum shop-like postcards, a photobook and a special wine label edition.

He flew for the South African Air Force during the Second World War, trained as an artist, then became Umkhonto we Sizwe's first explosives expert. He was imprisoned for sabotage, and after his release served another sentence for telling a journalist about poor prison conditions. He wrote two semi-autobiographical books, and completed the Comrades Marathon twice, winning a medal once. He married twice and had three children. Early life, art and running Harold Strachan was born in Pretoria on 1 December 1925. His father had been a metalworker in the Clyde shipyards who had emigrated from Scotland to South Africa in 1902, and his mother was a teacher from an Afrikaner family. When Harold was three his mother left his father for another Scotsman, Jimmy Brown. Brown died in 1931 from the effects of poison gas in the First World War, and his mother moved with Harold and his two sisters to Pietermaritzburg in Natal. He attended Merchiston Preparatory School then Maritzburg College, where he began to develop his political consciousness. Harvard of the SAAFalt=A low- winged monoplane pointing from left to right. Both of its tandem canopy places are open, showing the two aircrew, and its two-bladed propeller is still. It is bare-metal with high-visibility orange markings, and the symbols of the SAAF. Strachan joined the South African Air Force straight from school, and served as a pilot towards the end of the Second World War with the rank of lieutenant. He trained on the Tiger Moth and did advanced training on the Airspeed Oxford. From 1946 to 1949 he studied for a Fine Arts degree at Natal University College in Pietermaritzburg. In 1948 the ruling National Party introduced apartheid, a system of institutionalised racial segregation and discrimination against the black majority. In 1949 Strachan completed the Comrades Marathon, an ultramarathon run between Pietermaritzburg and Durban. For a period after he left the air force, as a reservist he used to enjoy spending a month of each year flying the Harvard to keep his proficiency. In 1950 Strachan won a scholarship to study at the Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in London, and married fellow South African Jean Middleton. In 1951 he took a course in painting restoration at the State Academy of Fine Arts in Stuttgart. In 1952 he returned to London and worked as a security guard, and in 1953 he managed his brother-in-law's painting and decorating business in Chingola in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), where he encouraged the black workers to unionise. During the 1950s he worked with the artist Selby Mvusi. Before he ran the 1954 Comrades Marathon, Strachan is supposed to have prepared for the race by drinking gin and vermouth with his wife. He finished sixth in 7 h 48 min and earned a gold medal. He was friendly with the English satirist Tom Sharpe until they fell out over a woman. Strachan worked as a lecturer and teacher from 1955 to 1960. He was divorced from Middleton in 1958. Activism, sabotage and imprisonment Strachan's opposition to apartheid arose from his personal ethics, rather than ideology. He became a founder member of the Liberal Party of South Africa in 1954, along with Alan Paton and Peter Brown, and in 1957 joined the Congress of Democrats. In 1959 he married Maggie von Lier, his former student. In 1960, during the protests after the Sharpeville massacre, he and Maggie stood between armed police and black protesters, preventing the police from firing. A warrant was issued for their arrest, and to avoid it they fled to Swaziland. Three months later they returned to South Africa, Harold under the name Robert \\"Jock\\" Lundie, and settled in Port Elizabeth where Harold worked with Govan Mbeki, and helped him produce and distribute the newsletter Izwe Lomzi (\\"Voice of the People\\"). In 1961 he joined the illegal South African Communist Party (SACP), and edited their newspaper New Age. He accepted Mbeki's request to improvise explosive devices for the newly-formed Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and experimented with substances such as nitric acid, potassium permanganate, magnesium, glycerol and icing sugar. alt=A black African man wearing overalls looks seriously at the camera. Strachan, who was MK's first explosives expert, designed a simple incendiary device based on petrol and initiated by glycerol filtering through beach sand onto potassium permanganate. He later researched and created an explosive device based on a form of ammonal, inspired by his reading of Robert Graves. He trained other operatives, who then disseminated the expertise through a clandestine cell system. His home-made bombs were planted at strategic infrastructure targets like electrical substations and railway lines. As far as is known, no lives were lost in these attacks. He was caught when one of his trainees planted an improperly constructed incendiary device in the magistrate's court in Butterworth. It failed to go off, was discovered, and the operative was traced by fingerprint evidence. When tortured by the police he revealed Strachan's address. Strachan was arrested at gunpoint and tried under the Explosives Act. He was found guilty of sabotage on 8 May 1962, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment, with three years suspended. He served thirteen months of his sentence in solitary confinement in Pretoria Central Prison, and had his teeth removed. He passed the time in solitary constructing a Tiger Moth in his imagination then preparing an aerobatics routine for it. When Strachan was named as a conspirator in the Rivonia Trial in 1963‚Äì64, he refused to give evidence against Mbeki and Denis Goldberg, even when he was threatened with hanging. Most of the accused at Rivonia (including Nelson Mandela) got life imprisonment as the law had been strengthened after Strachan's trial. On 31 March 1965 Strachan faced a further trial for other bomb attacks but was found not guilty. He was released in May. On his release, he gave an account of his life in prison to the journalist Benjamin Pogrund, who used it to write an article critical of the conditions under which prisoners were kept, which included frequent assaults and poor sanitary conditions. When the story was published in the Rand Daily Mail, in late June and early July 1965, the government invoked the Prisons Act. In the subsequent court case, a fellow saboteur gave evidence contradicting Strachan's allegations, and in May 1966 Strachan was imprisoned for years. This was reduced to on appeal, then to one year via an amnesty. During his second incarceration he was not allowed to read or study; he helped raise the morale of fellow political prisoners by designing props and costumes for amateur dramatics. Strachan's case and the publicity around it made the South African media much more cautious about publishing anything critical of any government agency; in the longer term they led to a process of prison reform which helped the next generation of political prisoners such as Mandela. Following his second release Strachan was banned from public gatherings until 1975 under the Suppression of Communism Act, 1950, and was also placed under house arrest for the last five years. In 1968 and 1972, Strachan applied to run in the Comrades Marathon, but was refused permission both times by the Chief Magistrate. In 1978, and again in 1979, unknown assailants fired shots at his house, leading him to fortify parts of it with steel plate and breeze blocks. The stress of imprisonment, banning, and the attacks on his home led to family difficulties. Ben Turok wrote in his autobiography that in the 1973 Durban strikes he had channelled funds via Strachan to support trade unions without the permission of the SACP, and that Turok had been expelled from the party for refusing to reveal his contact. Strachan was unusual among white activists in that he did not go into exile following his release but stayed on in South Africa. He acknowledged the support of his wife over the decades when he was unable to work. They had a daughter, Susie, and a son, Joe, and separated in the mid-1990s. Maggie Strachan went on to become a well-known local artist. Harold Strachan had a third child in France who he never met. Later life, writing, and death Drakensberg mountains, South Africa In 1990, Mandela was released on the orders of F. W. de Klerk; most apartheid legislation came to an end the following year. This was decisively endorsed by the ruling white minority in a 1992 referendum. That year, Mbeki and Strachan had a tearful reunion at the African National Congress (ANC) congress in Durban. Strachan became publicly alienated from the ANC because of what he saw as their authoritarian tendencies and the indiscriminate bombing campaigns they carried out after his imprisonment; in return, the ANC ensured that he was marginalised once they came to power. In South Africa's first majority election in 1994, when Mandela became the country's first democratically elected president, Strachan voted for the Democratic Party. He testified to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996 and 1997. His artistic career was held back by his activism, but he has paintings in the collection of Durban Art Gallery and in private collections. He worked as an art restorer, and illustrated Hugh Lewin's book Bandiet: Out Of Jail. In 1997, after his wife left him, a friend persuaded him to get a computer and to learn to type. He wrote an original manuscript, titled So It Goes, in six weeks. It was published as Way Up, Way Out in 1998, and describes his childhood in Pretoria, his schooling in Natal and his pilot training. It includes his descriptions of walking in the Drakensberg mountains, which he continued as his children grew up. Dan Jacobson commented in the London Review of Books that Strachan had \\"seized eagerly on the expressive potentialities of South African English demotic speech ... in order to make something new and rare of it\\". He made a link between the protagonist's \\"call to arms\\" in the Second World War and the author's motivation in his struggle against apartheid. Strachan was disappointed with the edited version that was published. Critics have debated whether it should be viewed as fiction or autobiography; Jacobson called it a Bildungsroman. His second book, Make a Skyf, Man! (2004) is about his time in MK and in prison. He describes his involvement as a \\"boys' own armed struggle\\"; one passage depicts a successful demonstration of a bomb to a senior comrade (Yoshke, based on Joe Slovo) by blowing up a beach toilet: The book begins and ends with stories about angling for shad, a longstanding passion of Strachan's. Both books are autobiographical fiction and were based on anecdotes he told. He described how he tried to use the techniques of painting, such as contrast of texture, in his writing, and expressed his admiration for the writing style of John Bunyan and Laurence Sterne (Tristram Shandy was his favourite book in prison), and the emotional authenticity of Thomas Hardy and Graham Greene. He also wrote regular columns for publications including the Weekend Witness and Noseweek. He remained as astrant (Afrikaans for \\"irreverent\\") in post-apartheid South Africa as he was as an activist. In April 2011 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Durban University of Technology in recognition of his contributions to art and democracy. In June 2011 he underwent triple coronary artery bypass surgery after suffering chest pains. Strachan moved to a care home in September 2019, and died from complications of liver disease on 7 February 2020, aged 94. He was cremated, and there was no funeral according to his wishes.

It was platted in 1894 by Chicagoans William Reissig and Charles Williams, near the intersection of the Nickel Plate Railroad and Joliet and Northern Indiana Railroad (\\"Joliet Cutoff\\"). A post office was established in 1898. The community was originally named \\"Kelly,\\" but had come to be called \\"Glen Park\\" by 1900. After the city of Gary was founded in 1906, the county built a bridge across the Little Calumet to extend Broadway to Glen Park. The portion of Glen Park north of 45th Avenue was annexed shortly thereafter, and the southern part followed in 1926. The first school in Glen Park was built in 1909, and the first church in 1911. Streetcars along Broadway allowed millworkers to commute from Glen Park to the Gary Works at the northern end of Broadway.

As an agent, he represented some of the biggest stars of the 1930s and 1940s, including Judy Garland, Betty Grable, and Edward G. Robinson, as well as directors Frank Capra and George Stevens. He was credited with persuading figure skating champion Sonja Henie to move to Hollywood and become an actress after the 1936 Winter Olympics. He later became a motion picture and television producer, whose works include Flight to Hong Kong and the television series The Texan. He was also married to actress June Lang, singer/actress Marie \\"The Body\\" McDonald, and model/actress Dolores Donlon. Early years Orsatti was born in Los Angeles, California, the son of Morris Orsatti and Mary Manse, both born in Italy. He had six siblings, including stuntman and baseball player for the St. Louis Cardinals Ernie Orsatti. Orsatti attended Los Angeles Manual Arts High School. He was recognized in 1923 as the best all-around high school athlete in Los Angeles. He played third base for the baseball team. In 1923, he won a bat with which Babe Ruth had hit the first home run in Yankee Stadium. The bat was the prize given by the Los Angeles Evening Herald for a high school home run hitting contest they sponsored. The bat, which was inscribed to Orsatti, sold in 2004 for $1.2 million. Orsatti subsequently attended the University of Southern California where he played quarterback on Howard Jones's 1925 and 1926 USC Trojans football teams, wearing number 5. He also played baseball and ran track and field at USC. Hollywood agent and producer Orsatti became a Hollywood talent agent in the 1930s. Along with his brothers Frank, Al and Ernie (a formar minor-league baseball player), he was a principal in the Orsatti Talent Agency. He was known as \\"one of the industry's sharpest agents,\\" and his clients included some of Hollywood's biggest stars, such as Sonja Henie, Judy Garland, Betty Grable, Edward G. Robinson, Frank Capra, George Stevens, Margaret O'Brien, and Alice Faye. His accomplishments as a talent agent include: Orsatti was credited with persuading Sonja Henie to move to Hollywood and become an actress after she won her third gold medal in figure skating at the 1936 Winter Olympics.

Orsatti also formed a production company in the 1950s called Saber Productions. The company produced 14 films including Flight to Hong Kong. Orsatti formed a television production company, Rorvic Productions, in partnership with actor Rory Calhoun. Rorvic produced the CBS television series The Texan, which aired on Monday evenings from 1958 to 1960. Actually the idea for The Texan came from Orsatti's then neighbor Desi Arnaz Sr. Episodes were budgeted at $40,000 each, with two black-and-white segments filmed weekly through Desilu Studios. Despite the name, the series was filmed not in Texas but mostly in Pearl Flats in the Mojave Desert of southern California.

Mayer with alcohol and women and later had a reputation for \\"handling all of MGM's 'dirty work'.\\" Orsatti and McDonald remained married until 1947. Even after their divorce, McDonald continued to use Orsatti as her agent, noting, \\"Husbands are much easier to find than good agents.\\" Orsatti's third marriage was to actress and Playboy Playmate Dolores Donlon. He was married to Donlon from 1949 to 1960. His fourth wife was Arla Turner Orsatti. They remained married at the time of Orsatti's death in 1984.

The second population was discovered in 2005 and had 15 to 20 individuals, including seedlings. The plant is threatened by the loss and degradation of its habitat due to human activity, including agriculture, development, and recreation. The small population size makes the species vulnerable to extinction in the event of a natural disaster, such as a typhoon.

It is similar to gaseous fire suppression (or dry chemical fire extinction). It employs a fire- extinguishing agent consisting of: very fine solid particles as well as gaseous matter. The condensed aerosol microparticles and effluent gases are generated by the exothermic reaction; the particles remain in vapor state until the process of being discharged from the device. Then, it is \\"condensed\\" and cooled within the device and discharged as solid particles. Compared to gaseous suppressants (which emit only gas) and dry chemical suppression agents (which are powder-like particles of a large size - 25‚Äì150 micrometres), the National Fire Protection Association defines condensed aerosols as those that release finely divided solids of less than 10 micrometres in diameter. The solid particulates have a considerably smaller mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) than those of dry chemical suppression agents. The particulates also remain airborne significantly longer and leave much less residue within the protected area. Condensed aerosols are flooding agents. They are effective regardless of the location and height of the fire. This can be contrasted with dry chemical systems, which must be directly aimed at the flame. The condensed aerosol agent can be delivered by means of mechanical operation, electric operation, or combined electro-mechanical operation. Wet chemical systems, generally found in foam extinguishers, must, similarly to dry chemical systems, be sprayed directionally onto the fire. Methods of fire extinction Fire tetrahedron Condensed aerosol suppressants, as with gaseous suppressants, use four methods to extinguish fires. They act on the four elements of what is known as the \\"fire tetrahedron:\\" the disparate components that combine to create the chemical reaction underlying any fire. These four means of fire extinction are: # Reduction or isolation of fuel # Reduction or isolation of oxygen # Reduction of heat # Inhibiting the chain reaction of the above components Condensed aerosols‚Äô primary extinguishing mechanism involves the fourth element of the fire tetrahedron by means of chemical reactions with the free radicals of the flame, therefore interfering with the combustion process of the fire. Typically, condensed aerosol particulates consist of potassium carbonate (K2CO3)) that are produced from the thermal decomposition of a solid aerosol-forming compound that includes potassium nitrate as an oxidizer. As the aerosol particles surround and come into contact with the flame, the particulates absorb the flame heat energy, breaking down and releasing large concentrations of potassium radicals (K+) (ions with an unpaired electron). The potassium radicals bond with the hydroxide (OH+), hydrogen (H+) and oxygen (O+) free radicals that sustain combustion, producing harmless by-product molecules like potassium hydroxide (KOH) and water (H2O). K‚Ä¢ + OH‚Ä¢ = KOH KOH + H‚Ä¢ = K‚Ä¢ + H2O The potassium radicals are propagated since they are both consumed and produced by reaction with the fire radicals. Disrupting the reactions necessary to sustain the flame's combustion, the cycle continues until the combustion's chain reactions are terminated and the flame is extinguished. Condensed aerosol agents also have secondary extinguishing mechanisms implicating the other three elements of the fire tetrahedron described above. The aerosol cools the flame by engulfing it with a cloud with large concentrations of microparticles with a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD). There are as small as 1 to 2 micrometres. Though the surface area of each microparticle is extremely small, the large quantity of particles surrounding and penetrating the flame offers a sufficiently large combined surface area to absorb the flame's heat. On the surface of the particles, recombination of the fire radicals takes place as energy is absorbed: O‚Ä¢ + H‚Ä¢ = OH‚Ä¢ H‚Ä¢ + OH‚Ä¢ = H20 Flame is the gaseous part of a fire resulting from the combustion of fuel. Aerosols particles and gases mixing with the gaseous components of the flame isolate the fire's fuel. Attacking all the elements of the fire tetrahedron, condensed aerosol fire suppression agents are among the more effective flame-extinguishing agents. For example, some condensed aerosol fire suppressants can extinguish a Class B flammable liquid pool fire with 1/5 the amount of Halon 1301 agent or 1/10 the amount of a hydrofluorocarbon or fluoroketone based clean agent gaseous fire suppression system in terms of kilogram mass of agent per cubic meter. Performance Fire, T1, at 35.25 seconds, before application of condensed aerosol suppressant Fire, T2, at 36.13 seconds, as condensed aerosol suppressant is just deployed Fire, T3, at 36.20 seconds, as condensed aerosol suppressant has been deployed Fire, T4, at 36.25 seconds, fully extinguished after application of condensed aerosol suppressant The extinguishing performance of condensed aerosol fire suppressants is dependent on the density of aerosol particulates in the immediate vicinity of the flame. As with gaseous fire suppression systems, the faster the agent can build around the flame, the more efficient the extinguishing agent is at stopping combustion. The extinguishing and design densities of aerosol fire suppression agents are generally expressed in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m^3). Thus, the efficiency of aerosol extinguishing agents varies depending on a number of factors, such as the location of the aerosol relative to the flame, the proximity of other combustible flammable materials, the type of fuel involved, etc. Condensed aerosol devices are designed to provide a controlled discharge. The aerosol-forming compound is installed inside of the device, which is then fitted with an electric or mechanical initiator. The electric initiator is interfaced with a fire-detection control unit or panel, which can be remotely operated by physical means such as by cable, operated by hand with a fuse mechanism such as those used in smoke dispensing grenades, or automatic and self-triggering when outfitted with an integral heat-sensing device. Uses and applications There are two uses for applying fire extinguishing agents: as a total flooding fire protection system or as a local application fire- suppression system. To provide total flooding fire suppression, the total quantity of aerosol required to extinguish a fire inside of fixed space must be determined. The corresponding number of aerosol devices that would collectively discharge the aerosol quantity required are then mounted, typically on the ceiling or wall. Aerosol devices equipped with electric initiators are interconnected and relayed by a fire alarm control panel. Because the aerosol devices are self-contained and function as both a storage container and as a nozzle that propels the gas, no distribution network is required to transport or distribute the fire-extinguishing agent from a remote storage location, resulting in floor space savings and transportation efficiency gains. Local-application fire suppression is typically applied by a handheld portable device tossed directly toward the fire. Unlike streaming portable fire extinguishing units, the operators are not required to place themselves at risk by approaching the fire while applying the extinguishing agent directly at the flames. The portable condensed aerosol device is typically designed to disperse aerosol in a 360¬∞ spray pattern, forming a large aerosol cloud around the vicinity of the fire. The aerosol immediately attacks the flames as its particles approach the fire and generate flame- neutralizing potassium radicals. The flames are suppressed as long as the aerosol retains sufficient density. If the aerosol fails to achieve sufficient density to extinguish the fire, it still suppresses the fire, which retains significantly lower heat. This offers firefighters, for instance, a tool to bring down flames to a manageable heat level and reduce room temperatures while the hose team enters the burning area. As another example, first responders can deploy condensed aerosols within an enclosed area to suppress fires while evacuating occupants to safety. Condensed aerosol systems are suitable for special hazards applications as replacements for Halon 1301 systems and high-pressure carbon dioxide systems. Aerosol systems can also be used as alternatives to clean agent gaseous suppressants or water-mist systems. Environmental issues The United States Environmental Protection Agency has approved condensed aerosol fire suppression systems as acceptable substitutes for Halon 1301 in Total Flooding Systems.U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \\"Substitutes for Halon 1301 as a Total Flooding Agent\\". Aerosol extinguishers are also non-ozone depleting and carry little or no global warming potential.  Safety concerns  On March 13, 2016, 8 people were killed and 7 injured when an aerosol system false activated in a bank vault. Claims in the news were that the system depleted oxygen, whereas the manufacturer states that the system does not displace oxygen. On November 15, 2019, one person was killed on board a fishing vessel in the UK when a condensed aerosol fire suppression system was inadvertently activated during installation.
