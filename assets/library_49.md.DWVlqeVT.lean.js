Abeynaike was a right-handed batsman who bowled slow left-arm orthodox. Born at Mount Lavinia, he was educated at S. Thomas' College Mount Lavinia, in the Dominion of Ceylon (today Sri Lanka). He was the son of Orville Abeynaike. International career Abeynaike made his first-class debut for the Mercantile Cricket Association against the Pakistan Under-25s. His first first-class match for Sri Lanka came against Tamil Nadu in the 1974/75 Gopalan Trophy. A further first-class appearance followed in 1976, when he was a part of the Sri Lanka Board President's XI team which played the touring Pakistanis. A year later he appeared for Sri Lanka in a first-class match against the touring Marylebone Cricket Club, who he also made his List A debut against. English County Cricket In 1978, Abeynaike joined English county Bedfordshire, making his debut against Cambridgeshire in that seasons Minor Counties Championship. Following the 1978 season, he returned to Sri Lanka where he made two List A appearances for the Sri Lanka Board President's XI against the touring West Indians. Over the coming seasons he continued to play in England for Bedfordshire, playing Minor counties cricket from 1978 to 1982 (with the exception of 1980), making 38 Minor Counties Championship appearances, as well as a single List A appearance in the 1982 NatWest Trophy against Somerset.

History Plaque for the 750¬∞ anniversary with a citation of the \\"Liber Paradisus\\" at Palazzo d'Accursio, Bologna. After the battle of Fossalta (1249) almost all Signorie (Lordships) of Bologna countryside were defeated. The result was an ethical and economic reflection on the serfs' status, until then determined by their bond to their owners, called Signori (Lords). On 25 August 1256, the Arengo bell of the Palace of Podest√† (Bologna) called Bolognese citizens into the Piazza Maggiore, where the Podest√† (head of city government, expression of urban aristocracy), Bonaccorso da Soresina, and the Capitano del popolo (head of city militia, expression of urban bourgeoisie) announced the liberation of about 6,000 serfs, owned by 400 lords. They were emancipated by the payment, from the communal treasury, of 8 (for children) or 10 (for adults) Bolognese silver lire, which was the market price. For the emancipation of 5,855 serfs, the Commune paid 54,014 Bolognese Lire. There was, arguably, some economic benefit for the city in the emancipation of so many serfs: firstly, free men were better workers; secondly, freedmen were no longer exempt from the taxes of the Commune (and, in fact, the Commune forbade freed serfs to move outside the diocese to which they belonged). In some cases, the serfs were gathered in certain free places (Italian: franco), from which the names of towns like Castelfranco Emilia. Whether, however, the economic benefits outweighed the economic disadvantages caused by the loss of so much unremunerated labor is hard to assess. Whatever the case, a combination of theological and practical concerns seems to have led to the extraordinary Bolognese mass manumission, and the Liber Paradisus is a powerful theological treatise on human equality. The \\"Heaven Book\\" With this act, also called Paradisum voluptatis, Bologna was probably the first city in the world to abolish slavery. In 1257 the Commune ordered four notaries ‚Äì between them Rolandino de' Passaggeri ‚Äì to catalogue names and details of freed serfs in a memorial. This book is now kept at the State Archives (in Piazza dei Celestini, Bologna), and it is called Paradisus because the first written word is Heaven, to remember that God created man in paradise in perfect and perpetual freedom.

It is owned by the provincial government. Opened in 1958, the system expanded to three routes by 1961 and remained relatively static in size and configuration until 1989, when a fourth route opened. Additional routes opened in 2004 and 2005, bringing the system to its maximum extent of six routes, which linked the city center with some of its metropolitan suburbs. However, one of the original routes (Villanueva) was suspended from 2005 to 2011, and consequently no more than five routes were operating concurrently during that period. In the 2010s, the provincial government entity that had always operated the system, the Empresa Provincial de Transportes de Mendoza (EPTM), began to experience increasingly worsening financial problems, due in large part to difficulties in keeping its fleet of approximately 30-year-old trolleybuses operating reliably. Construction projects around the city, including work on the new Metrotranv√≠a Mendoza light rail system, also disrupted trolleybus service, and the actual number of trolleybuses in service declined considerably. At the end of 2016, the provincial legislature voted to dissolve EPTM entirely and replace it with a new company, the Sociedad de Transporte de Mendoza (STM), and this change was put into effect on 1 January 2017. All remaining trolleybus service was suspended in May 2017. A plan to make the suspension a permanent closure gave way to one calling for retention of trolleybus service on one route, the Parque route (the system's very first route, dating to 1958), with the other five routes permanently closed. The suspension lasted 16 months, and trolleybus service resumed on the Parque route in January 2019. History =20th century= The system traces its origins to law number 825, enacted in 1958 with the goal of making a trolleybus system one of the main means of transport in the city and the suburbs surrounding it. On 14 February 1958, at the intersection of 9 de Julio and Necochea streets, Dr. Isidoro Bousquet formally opened Mendoza's trolleybus system. The first line to be put into service by the system's operator, the Empresa Provincial de Transportes de Mendoza (EPTM), was the \\"Parque\\" line, also known as line number 1. To this day, that line still follows the same route (9 de Julio, Col√≥n, Ar√≠stides Villanueva, Boulogne Sur Mer, Jorge A. Calle, Per√∫ and Godoy Cruz streets). The system's second line, \\"Villa Nueva\\", opened in February 1959 and the third, \\"Dorrego\\", in March 1961. Publicly, the routes were designated by names only, not numbers, and this practice continued until the mid-1990s and was revived in the 2010s. =21st century= The Mendoza trolleybus system was still expanding significantly as recently as the mid-2000s, with the construction of a long new line connecting Godoy Cruz with Las Heras, and of a shorter line connecting the bus terminal with the National University of Cuyo. These opened in April 2004Trolleybus Magazine No. 256 (July‚ÄìAugust 2004), p. 90.

One of the ex-Vancouver vehicles in service on the Parque route in 2014. These vehicles were retired in 2017. In 2009‚Äì10, the entire trolleybus fleet was replaced with Flyer trolleybuses acquired secondhand from the Vancouver trolleybus system, in Canada. Although already 26 years old at the time, these vehicles were believed to be in better condition than EPTM's then-existing fleet of secondhand German trolleybuses built in the 1970s. EPTM refurbished them before placing them in service. The number of serviceable trolleybuses in the fleet grew to 60 by 2010, and the scheduled peak vehicle requirement was 48.Trolleybus Magazine No. 297 (May‚ÄìJune 2011), p. 63.

(PDF).Trolleybus Magazine No. 288 (November‚ÄîDecember 2009), p. 134. However, by early 2011 EPTM was having trouble keeping the ex-Vancouver vehicles running reliably. By the end of 2011, the situation had already worsened considerably, with only 40 of the 60‚Äì62 vehicles being listed as serviceable but only around 25 typically available for service after subtracting nominally serviceable vehicles that were awaiting correction of minor defects.Trolleybus Magazine No. 302 (March‚ÄìApril 2012), p. 40. During several periods in the early 2010s, one or two routes (from among three affected routes) were temporarily operated by motorbuses for extended periods due to the need for detours caused by construction of the Metrotranv√≠a Mendoza light rail system. In 2012, EPTM took delivery of a new low-floor trolleybus built in Argentina by Materfer, which EPTM had helped to design.Trolleybus Magazine No. 309 (May‚ÄìJune 2013), p. 72. It entered service in June 2012, at which time 47 Flyer trolleybuses were considered serviceable.Trolleybus Magazine No. 305 (September‚ÄìOctober 2012), p. 148. Additional new Materfer vehicles were purchased subsequently, and a total of 13 were built, but only 12 ever entered service.Trolleybus Magazine No. 340 (July‚ÄìAugust 2018), p. 146. Meanwhile, EPTM continued to experience reliability problems with the Flyer trolleybuses, now more than 30 years old, and a large number were withdrawn from service between 2013 and 2015.Trolleybus Magazine No. 320 (March‚ÄìApril 2015), p. 52. In mid-September 2016, only eleven Flyers were available for service, along with 12 Materfer trolleybuses.Trolleybus Magazine No. 330 (November‚ÄìDecember 2016), p. 168. Change of operator, suspension At the end of 2016, the provincial government dissolved EPTM, which had been the trolleybus's only operator for its entire history up to that time (nearly 59 years), after concluding that its financial losses were too great.Trolleybus Magazine No. 332 (March‚ÄìApril 2017), p. 67. It was immediately replaced, on 1 January 2017, by a new operating company named Sociedad de Transporte de Mendoza (STM), a newly formed single-shareholder public corporation (a Sociedad An√≥nima Unipersonal, or SAU), a private company that is, however, still owned by the provincial government. In late 2016, the Villa Nueva and Godoy Cruz‚ÄìLas Heras routes were being operated by motorbuses due to a shortage of serviceable trolleybuses. On 1 January 2017, the provincial authority divided the latter route, the system's longest, into two routes and transferred their operation to a different company, with motorbuses replacing all trolleybus service in that corridor. In late March 2017, the provincial transport secretary announced plans to close the trolleybus system entirely by the end of the year.Trolleybus Magazine No. 334 (July‚ÄìAugust 2017), p. 146. Later, it was decided that all trolleybus service would be suspended, due to ongoing disruption caused by several construction projects around the city, but would resume late in 2017 on one or more routes‚Äîbut likely for only a few months before a permanent closure. The last day of trolleybus service was 4 May 2017, when just one vehicle (Materfer No. 408) was in service, on the Pellegrini route.Trolleybus Magazine No. 335 (September‚ÄìOctober 2017), p. 186. By mid-2018, it had been decided that trolleybus service would be reinstated on only one route, the Parque route, with the others being now considered permanently closed. Also, only the 12 modern Materfer trolleybuses would return to service, with all remaining ex- Vancouver Flyer vehicles now permanently retired. The planned resumption of trolleybus service on the Parque route was delayed, and test runs using trolleybuses along the route (after reinstatement of some wiring removed for road construction) only started in October 2018.Trolleybus Magazine No. 342 (November‚ÄîDecember 2018), p. 224. Trolleybus service resumed on 2 January 2019 ‚Äì operating only on the Parque route, as planned.Trolleybus Magazine No. 344 (March‚ÄìApril 2019), p. 67.  Lines  At its peak, the system had six lines: * 1 ‚Äì Parque (Park): A large one-way loop that includes Avenida Boulogne Sur Mer (including the 'Portones', the entry to the General San Mart√≠n Park), the city center (Avenida 9 de Julio and Avenida Col√≥n) and Avenida Aristides Villanueva * 2 ‚Äì Villa Nueva: Connecting the city center with the Villa Nueva district, to the east, in Guaymall√©n Department * 3 ‚Äì Dorrego: Connecting the city center with the Dorrego district, in Guaymall√©n * 4 ‚Äì Pellegrini: From the city center to Barrio San Mart√≠n, to the northwest, via Calle Pellegrini and other streets * 5 ‚Äì Godoy Cruz‚ÄìLas Heras: connects three Mendoza's Departamentos (administrative divisions): Godoy Cruz, Capital and Las Heras, mostly along the arterial street, Avenida San Mart√≠n * 6 ‚Äì UNCuyo: Connecting the Universidad Nacional de Cuyo (UNCuyo) with the city center  Fleet  = Current fleet = One of the new Materfer trolleybuses in 2015 The system is served with Materfer trolleybuses. EPTM began to consider acquiring all-new trolleybuses, and ultimately partnered with Materfer, an Argentine manufacturer of railway vehicles and buses, to construct a prototype low-floor trolleybus. EPTM designed the new vehicle, and Materfer built it. It was delivered on 1 March 2013 and entered service on the Mendoza trolleybus system on 7 June 2013.Trolleybus Magazine No. 311 (September‚ÄìOctober 2013), p. 128. Numbered 401, it was the first low-floor trolleybus built in Argentina and EPTM's first all-new trolleybus since the mid-1980s. Its body and chassis were built by Materfer, and its electrical equipment by Siemens, but the latter was replaced by equipment from Schneider Electric later in 2013. EPTM placed an order in July 2013 for 12 more Materfer/Schneider trolleybuses, and the first two were delivered in April 2014.Trolleybus Magazine No. 316 (July‚ÄìAugust 2014), p. 100. These new trolleybuses are long. Six Materfer trolleybuses had entered service by October 2014, numbered 401‚Äì406, and by June 2015 the number had reached eleven.Trolleybus Magazine No. 323 (September‚ÄìOctober 2015), p. 148. The final total quantity built was 13, but the last unit (No. 413) never entered service and was cannibalized of parts to keep the others running. When the system reopened in January 2019, it ran using only eight Materfer trolleybuses. = Past fleet = The Vancouver Flyer trolleybuses were repainted in Mendoza and re-lettered with EPTM's name and \\"El Trole\\" branding. Two-tone green was only one of five livery variations given to the ex- Vancouver vehicles. Russian-built ZIU trolleybus and ex-Solingen trolleybus in the city center in 2008 Solingen TS trolleybus in 2007 Mendoza's initial trolleybuses were a fleet of Mercedes-Benz units bought secondhand from the Buenos Aires trolleybus system, with a final total of 25 being acquired by 1960.Morgan, Steve (May‚ÄìJune 1987). \\"Expansion in Mendoza\\". Trolleybus Magazine No. 153, pp. 58‚Äì63. National Trolleybus Association (UK). . However, these were soon replaced by a fleet of 36 Japanese Toshiba vehicles, built new in 1962. All of the Mercedes-Benz trolleybuses were already retired by the end of 1963. In 1984, the system acquired 17 new ZIU-9 trolleybuses from the Russian Uritsky factory. In 1988, EPTM began replacing the remaining Toshiba vehicles with secondhand trolleybuses that had previously operated on the Solingen trolleybus system in Germany. EPTM acquired 78 of these German trolleybuses, known as (TS) buses and, in stages over the next several years, put 58 of them back into service. The remaining 20 TS vehicles were used initially as spare parts donors. However, due to a network expansion in about 2005, even more TS vehicles were reactivated. All of the TS trolleybuses originally kept their Solingen fleet numbers, except with a \\"0\\" added before the fleet number in the case of two units whose Solingen numbers were the same as the number of a still-active ZIU trolleybus. However, at the beginning of 1996 they were renumbered into a new, continuous series. In 1997 they were reliveried in blue. Due to their German origins, they were also known in Argentina as los alemanes (the Germans). TS vehicle no. 37 was given a special task. For a time, it was used for tourist sightseeing tours, with a revised interior design and a special livery. The last five serviceable ZIU trolleybuses were retired in January 2009 and were sold in September to the C√≥rdoba trolleybus system.Trolleybus Magazine No. 289 (January‚ÄìFebruary 2010), p. 12. National Trolleybus Association (UK). From April 2009, Mendoza's TS trolleybuses were successively replaced. By early March 2010, there were only eleven TS vehicles still in use. Their final operating day was 1 May 2010. A German group, the Obus-Museum Solingen e. V., helped to secure the return of one of the TS trolleybuses to Germany, for preservation. No. 51 (ex-Solingen 68) was chosen in 2011, and it was transported back to Solingen in 2014.Trolleybus Magazine No. 318 (November‚ÄìDecember 2014), p. 154. National Trolleybus Association (UK). Another TS trolleybus, No. 80 (ex-Solingen 10) was acquired by the Obus-Museum Solingen and left Mendoza for Germany in October 2019.  Vancouver Flyer buses  The replacements for the TS vehicles were 80 secondhand Flyer E901A/E902 vehicles from the Vancouver trolleybus system in Canada, which were built in the early 1980s. They began to arrive during December 2008, and all 80 had arrived by February 2009.Trolleybus Magazine No. 285 (May‚ÄìJune 2009), p. 59. After being refurbished, repainted and renumbered in Mendoza, they began to enter service on 30 April 2009.Trolleybus Magazine No. 286 (July‚ÄìAugust 2009), p. 85. By June 2010, 60 had been refurbished and repainted, and 40 had entered service.Trolleybus Magazine No. 293 (September‚ÄìOctober 2010), p. 110. The repainting involved five different liveries, all with the colours laid out in the same pattern, with each version given to 12 vehicles (in the first 60). They were renumbered from their four-digit Vancouver fleet numbers into the series 01‚Äì60. The Flyer vehicles were intended to allow the EPTM to improve trolleybus services, and to operate extensions of new lines that were already in service. However, by 2011, EPTM had already begun to experience problems maintaining the Flyers, due in part to their age (about 30 years) and in part also to the loss, during shipment, of maintenance manuals and a crate of spare parts shipped from Canada in 2009. In December 2011, more than one-third of the Flyer trolleybuses were reported to be out of service due to chronic maintenance problems. In 2017, after all trolleybus service was temporarily suspended, EPTM announced that the ex-Vancouver Flyer trolleybuses would not return to service when the system, only the Materfer vehicles. The last use of any Flyers took place in May 2017. Except for one preserved locally by the Godoy Cruz Railway Museum, the last 17 Flyers were sold for scrap in April 2018.

It includes extensive areas of the Paroo- Darling and Currawinya National Parks, both of which are listed under the Ramsar Convention as wetland sites of international importance, as well as of the Nocoleche Nature Reserve. Description The IBA contains the lower Paroo floodplain, including the overflow lakes, as well as the Yantabulla swamp and the Cuttaburra Creek floodplain. The area contains a complex network of channels, wetlands and lakes. Water is received from local rainfall or the Paroo River. Floods occur erratically; water enters from the Paroo, the Warrego River via Cuttaburra Creek and other channels, or backs up from the Darling River in the south, filling shallow channels, floodplain depressions and numerous ephemeral lakes. Ranging to 5.5 m in depth, some lakes retain water for up to three years. The shores and channels support samphire, lignum, canegrass and other grasses, with black-box and other riparian woodland communities which flood seasonally. Currawinya National Park also has Acacia shrublands on sand sheets and dunes. The region has a desert climate, with low and very variable rainfall usually falling in summer; mean annual rainfall at Currawinya is 278 mm.BirdLife International. (2011).

James was educated at Dr. Henry Newcome's school at Hackney, where he took part in amateur theatricals. In 1788 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, but migrated to Clare Hall, where he graduated B.A. in 1792, M.A. in 1795, and B.D. in 1808. In 1793 he was elected fellow of Clare. On 18 May 1812 he was presented to the living of Great Gransden, Huntingdonshire, which he held till his death there on 23 January 1832.

As the Sabbath had been ordained for cattle and humans, Plumptre considered it a \\"national sin\\" for horses to be used on this day. His sermon was not well received and was considered by many to be beneath the dignity of the pulpit. Plumptre published Three Discourses on the Case of Animal Creation in 1816.

The first company to use the Pullman name was founded in 1926 by Norman Pearce and Hartas Foxton. The Yorkshire Pullman remained in use until the company was deregistered in 2000. In 2007 haulage firm K&J; Logistics revived the name for use on its excursion programme and open-top tour of York. History =Original company (1926‚Äì2000)= York PullmanCompanies House extract company no 217021 Marshfield (York )Limited formerly York Pullman Bus Company Limited was founded in 1926 as a partnership between Norman Pearce, who for the preceding six years had operated a service between York and Stamford Bridge, and Hartas Foxton. Its name and livery of maroon, cream and yellow was derived from the luxury Pullman train carriages in use at the time. In January 1930 Pearce left the company and Foxton became its sole owner, a position he retained until his death thirty years later. In 1938 Pullman opened a new depot in York's Navigation Road to complement its three existing sites, which were no longer large enough to hold the company's fleet. One of these garages, Piccadilly in York, was used by the government during World War II. In 1951 the company moved its headquarters to Bootham Tower. Pullman continued to expand, and by the 1970s was carrying over one million passengers annually. In 1974 its fleet had increased to 30 vehicles and it was the largest operator of tours and excursions in York, with a small number of local bus services also operated. Coach services were deregulated in October 1980; Pullman introduced a service between York and London in conjunction with Epsom Coaches, but this proved unsuccessful and was quickly withdrawn. The Foxton family, which had retained control of the firm after Hartas Foxton's death in 1960, sold York Pullman to Reynard Coaches in January 1985. The newly enlarged company, now owned by John and David Marsh, was renamed Reynard Pullman. Following the deregulation of bus services in October 1986, new services were introduced in competition with established operators. By 1988 the fleet stood at 47 vehicles, the majority of which were used on scheduled services in Harrogate, Tadcaster and York, in the latter case in competition with York City & District. The expansion proved short-lived, with the York Pullman name and 20 coaches sold to municipal operator Kingston-upon- Hull City Transport in February 1990. Later in the same year Reynard itself was acquired by Yorkshire Rider, which also took over York City & District to end competition in York. KHCT began to face increased competition on its core network in the 1990s, and in 1993 it was decided to privatise the company. In readiness for this coaching activities were reduced, and York Pullman was sold to Durham Travel Services who expanded its operations to include school buses, open-top tours and contracted bus services, but in February 2000 sold its York operations to First York, who had earlier acquired Yorkshire Rider and were the dominant operator in the city. The York Pullman name was abandoned, and the office at Bootham Tower closed in October 2002, breaking the last link with the original company. Some of Pullman's older vehicles have been preserved. =Revival (2007‚Äìpresent)= K&J; Logistics,Companies House extract company no 3349679 K&J; Logistics Limited a haulage firm which also operated a small number of buses, was formed in 2001 with a depot in Rufforth. Its managing director, Tom James, had worked for York Pullman during the 1980s. In 2007 the former Pullman office at Bootham Tower became available for lease. K&J; moved into the office and decided to revive the Pullman name, which was no longer registered by an existing company. K&J; also reopened the former booking office in York's Exhibition Square and acquired the original company's telephone number. Ten vehicles were initially painted into Pullman livery, and were first used in April 2007. To coincide with the reintroduction of the name, the company introduced a sightseeing tour of York using open-top buses in addition to coach hire and excursion work. Later, in September 2007, the company won the Best Small Operator award at the Showbus Rally 2007. In October 2009 Pullman's school bus services to Fulford School was used by City of York Council to trial a texting service designed to prevent bullying on school buses. In late September 2010 a new route between York city centre and the two campuses used by the University of York was introduced. Branded as Unibus, the service was subsidised by the University, who stated that First York had declined to extend its existing service 4 to serve the newly opened campus at Heslington East. In response to the new route's introduction First extended route 4 to Heslington East in competition with Pullman's route and reduced its fares on the route. A York Pullman bus became stuck in a ditch while operating route 36 in Melbourne in October 2010. In April 2011 another vehicle caught fire after its engine overheated while working a service to Manor C of E School on the A1237 road in April 2011, but pupils were quickly evacuated by the driver and there were no injuries. The company stepped in to replace two journeys withdrawn by East Yorkshire Motor Services on their route 195 in September 2011, taking over their operation as route X36 on a short- term contract. In February 2012 Transdev York purchased the local services operated by York Pullman with 17 buses and 31 staff transferring. Operations Open-top Leyland Olympian in York in November 2009 Before February 2012, York Pullman operated a network of local services; these are now operated by Transdev York, who initially retained the same timetables as those used by Pullman. The coach hire side of the business was not affected and continues to operate. School bus services are also provided by the company.

Prominent models operated included the AEC Regal III single-decker and AEC Regent III double-decker; examples of both have been preserved. K&J; Logistics operated 30 vehicles at the time that it adopted the York Pullman name. Ten were painted into Pullman colours, including six coaches (five Volvo B10Ms and a Scania K114IB), three open-top double-deckers (a Bristol VR, a Leyland Titan and a Leyland Olympian) and a minibus. These buses were given fleet numbers beginning at 195, continuing the numbering sequence used by the original company before 2000. The revived company's fleet later developed includes several types of coach, low-floor buses for local routes, and an open-top AEC Routemaster. Several Leyland Tiger single-deckers were acquired from Ulsterbus in 2010. Seventeen vehicles were sold to Transdev York as part of the February 2012 sale, leaving 50 vehicles in the Pullman fleet.

History The Henderson family owned Gardie from the 17th century, and in 1724 Magnus Henderson (died 1753) had the present house built. The builder was a mason from Aberdeen named Forbes. The double-pile plan of Gardie was relatively novel in the early 18th century. The symmetrical arrangement of walled gardens leading down to a harbour was laid out at the same time. The drawing room contains fine wooden panelling, installed around 1750. The house passed out of the Henderson family in 1799, and was inherited by Elizabeth Nicolson and her husband Thomas Mouat of Garth, the builder of Belmont House on Unst. Their nephew, William Mouat, added the porch and constructed the steading and Gothic cottage in the grounds. Sir Walter Scott dined at Gardie House during his 1814 visit to Shetland. In 1905 the house was altered, and remains privately owned. In 2001, the owner was John Hamilton Scott, Lord Lieutenant of Shetland.

The idea to found the movement originated during the war in a group of prominent Dutchmen who had been interned as hostages by the German occupation authorities in the Gymnasium Beekvliet in Sint- Michielsgestel in 1942. Many of them would later occupy prominent positions in Dutch political and social life, like future prime-ministers Willem Schermerhorn and Jan de Quay, academics Pieter Geyl, Nikolaas Tinbergen and Hendrik Brugmans, and politicians Willem Banning and Marinus van der Goes van Naters. With ideologies such as fascism and communism permanently excluded from Dutch politics, the NVB was intended to renew the political landscape in the Netherlands. A doorbraak would have to occur in the pillarized political landscape: politics was no longer dominated by the opposition between Christian and secular parties (the so-called Antithesis). These ideas led to the fusion of three pre-war political parties: the SDAP, the VDB and the CDU into the new PvdA. The founding Congress of this new party was chaired by Willem Banning, a prominent member of the NVB. The NVB was disbanded in 1951.

Salvinia stem-borer moths lay their eggs on water plants like Azolla caroliniana (water velvet), Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), and Salvinia rotundifolia (water fern). Larval feeding on host plants causes plant death, which makes S. multiplicalis a good candidate for biological control of weedy water plants like Salvinia molesta, an invasive water fern in Australia. However, high rates of parasitism in the moth compromise its ability to effectively control water weeds. S. multiplicalis larvae are a pale yellow to green color, and adults develop tan coloration with darker patterning. The lifespan, from egg to the end of adulthood is typically three to four weeks. The species was first described by Achille Guen√©e in 1854.  Geographic range  Samea multiplicalis was first observed in Brazil in 1854, and has since been documented across the southeastern United States, as far west as Louisiana. This region constitutes its native range. In 1981, the moth was introduced in Australia as a potential method of biological control of the water fern, S. molesta. It is now common throughout Queensland and New South Wales. In Australia, it has been found to thrive in tropical climates, with slower growth and dispersal in more temperate climates.  Habitat  S. multiplicalis primarily lives on the water plants, Azolla caroliniana (water velvet), Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), Salvinia rotundifolia (water fern) in their native range, and Salvinia molesta (a water fern) in Australia. These plants grow to form floating mats on the surface of calm or still bodies of water like ponds, lakes, and slow-moving rivers. S. multiplicalis can survive within a temperature range of 11-36 ¬∞C, however it survives best around temperatures of 30 ¬∞C. It requires warm conditions to survive and develop, however steady temperatures above the low 30s cause populations to crash. Moth populations can survive year round in habitats where food resources and adequate temperatures are sustained through the winter.  Food resources  Water lettuce = Host plant = Pistia stratiotes In its native habitat, S. multiplicalis prefers the water lettuce P. stratiotes over other aquatic plants for feeding and oviposition, and in its introduced habitat in Australia, it primarily feeds and lays eggs on the water fern Salvinia molesta. P. stratiotes has a rosette of leaves surrounding a short, central stem and a submerged root system. Leaves are covered in short hairs. S. molesta plants in Australia are all clones, meaning they are genetically identical. However, there is some phenotypic variation due to differing temperature and nitrogen availability across its range, which is important due to S. multiplicalis larvae's preference for high-nitrogen food sources. = Food preferences = Caterpillars of the salvinia stem-borer moth feed on several aquatic plants, primarily Azolla caroliniana (water velvet), Pistia stratiotes (water lettuce), Salvinia rotundifolia (water fern), Salvinia molesta (a water fern), and occasionally Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth). Feeding by colonies of larvae often leads to intensive damage and plant death after two or three weeks of feeding. Larvae eat by boring into plant stems or feeding externally on leaves. = Protection while feeding = Often, groups of larvae display cooperative behavior when they feed in groups. They collectively construct a silk canopy over their feeding site while they eat, expanding it as they exhaust their current site and move on to new areas of their host plant. This behavior offers protection from predation, decreasing larval mortality. = Larval nutrition = Nitrogen is very important nutrient for larval development, especially during the first two instars, so larvae prefer food plants with higher nitrogen content. Higher nitrogen intake correlates with larger larval biomass and faster development, both of which are favored because they decrease larval vulnerability to predation. Additionally, a lack of sufficient nitrogen intake during early development leads to decreased ability to digest and utilize food throughout the rest of the insect's life. = Compensatory feeding = Water lettuce and other aquatic plants tend to have high water content, which dilutes the nitrogen and other nutrients they contain. To account for this, S. muliplicalis has a higher feeding rate than many other Lepidoptera species. When nitrogen levels are especially low, larvae show compensatory feeding behavior, increasing their already high feeding rate and consuming a larger volume in order to make up for the nutrient deficit. This behavior does not usually mitigate the poor quality food, however, and larvae on nitrogen- depleted host plants still experience slower development and decreased digestive efficiency.  Life history  = Larvae = Samea multiplicalis larva Larvae hatch approximately four days after eggs are laid. Larvae have an off-white or pale yellow color during early instars and develop a yellow-green color as they mature. They typically develop through five instars over the course of about two weeks, and male larvae develop faster than females by about two days. In low-nitrogen conditions, larvae require a sixth instar and two or three additional days to develop. = Pupae = Caterpillars construct a silk cocoon inside of a leaf petiole on their host plant in order to pupate. Pupation lasts between four and ten days, with females developing faster than males. Time spent in this stage of development is not dependent on larval nutrition. Adult salvinia stem-borer moth = Adults = After they emerge from their cocoons, adult salvinia stem-borer moths spend the rest of their three- or four-week life span around their host plants, mating and laying eggs. Female moths lay an average of 150 eggs over the course of several days on the surfaces of host plant leaves or among hairs or leaflet structures. Moths prefer the host plant P. stratiotes for laying eggs due to its structure which provides abundant oviposition surfaces. Moths are not known to oviposit on E. crassipes. Adults are tan with darker markings on both sets of wings and a wingspan of about 20 mm. Adult size is not significantly affected by larval nutrition levels, however insufficient nitrogen during larval development does lead to reduced egg production in female moths.  Enemies  = Parasites = S. multiplicalis is affected by a number of parasites, most commonly by wasp species of the order Hymenoptera and parasitic flies of the order Diptera, as well as miscrosporidia. Parasitic wasps attack S. multiplicalis larvae during their first instar and pre-pupal wasps emerge during the caterpillars' last instar, killing their hosts. Parasitism rates are fairly high in some populations, which diminishes their effectiveness at controlling weedy host plants. S. multiplicalis larvae are parasitized in both their native and introduced ranges by similar species. Parasitism rates remain steady through spring, summer, and fall and decrease slightly during winter months.  Interactions with humans  = Biological control agent = left S. molesta is an aquatic plant native to Brazil that is invasive in Australia due to a lack of sufficient herbivory to control the growth of the plant. It has become a common weed in many bodies of water, especially in eastern Australia in Queensland and New South Wales. The water fern grows in expansive mats, potentially crowding out other native aquatic plants and preventing light penetration in water bodies where it grows. Efforts to control S. molesta began in 1980 with the introduction of the salvinia weevil Cyrtobagous salviniae, which is also native to Brazil. S. multiplicalis was introduced the following year in 1981 to aid in the biological control of the weed.  C. salviniae and S. multiplicalis  Since their introduction, the two insects have had different levels of effectiveness; the weevil has proved more useful than the moth at keeping salvinia populations down through intensive feeding. While C. salviniae and S. multiplicalis both have similar habitat needs, including common host plants, similar nitrogen requirements, and an optimal temperature of 30 ¬∞C, S. multiplicalis populations are highly susceptible to parasites and parasitoids, which prevent the colony growth and dispersal that would be required for effective weed control. S. multiplicalis actually has a higher rate of reproduction and dispersal than C. salviniae, but infection prevalence still prevents sufficient levels of feeding to significantly affect S. molesta numbers.

Showing an early talent for working with his hands, Hitch created a small model for the vestry of Ware Parish Church when he was 12 years age. Apprenticeship In around 1860, Hitch was apprenticed to the architectural sculptors, Farmer and Brindley in London who worked in wood, stone and metal creating art metalwork and architectural furnishings. Until Hitch developed his own commissions it is difficult to speculate as to what he worked on, but the major commissions competed by his employers may provide some insight. Farmer and Brindley's clients at the time of Hitch's apprenticeship included Alfred Waterhouse and Sir Gilbert Scott and their projects included work on the Natural History Museum, Albert Memorial, and Westminster Cathedral. Hitch would have \\"carved out rough-hewn forms ready for the master carver to add the fine details and finishing touches to the sculpture.\\" To further his skills, Hitch attended Borough Polytechnic, now London South Bank University between 1894 and 1901, this arranged by Farmer and Brindley. Career After Farmer and Brindley, Hitch was employed by the sculptor Thomas Nicholls, one of whose projects was work at Lord Bute‚Äôs Cardiff Castle for the architect William Burges. Burges was responsible for considerable renovation to the castle, which included nine animal sculptures built into what was called the Animal Wall which was completed by Nicholls possibly with Hitch's assistance. Hitch's career spanned the years 1871 to 1935 and although he considered himself primarily as an architectural sculptor, he was also a mason, sculptor, sculptor's modeller and church decorator. For most of his life he ran a small business in Battersea in Greater London, employing several highly skilled masons.Nathaniel Hitch Architectural Sculptor and Modeller. Truro Cathedral Ltd.

The forewings are slightly darker than the hindwings. There are two generations per year. The larvae feed on Zea mays, Tripsacum dactyloides and Sorghum species. Young larvae feed within the plant whorl. They also tunnel in the midribs of leaves, and sometimes destroy growing points within leaf whorls. As larvae grow larger they tunnel into the stalks. Full-grown larvae are about 25 mm long. The winter form is creamy yellow with a dark brown head. The summer form is milky white and covered with black spots. The species overwinters in the larval stage within cavities in corn taproots. Summer pupation occurs in the portion of the stalk which is above the ground. Pupation of the hibernating generation occurs in the base of the stalk or in large roots.

It is a systemic herbicide which selectively kills most broadleaf weeds by causing uncontrolled growth in them but most grasses such as cereals, lawn turf, and grassland are relatively unaffected. 2,4-D is one of the oldest and most widely available herbicides and defoliants in the world, having been commercially available since 1945, and is now produced by many chemical companies since the patent on it has long since expired. It can be found in numerous commercial lawn herbicide mixtures, and is widely used as a weedkiller on cereal crops, pastures, and orchards. Over 1,500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient. History The discovery of 2,4-D as well as the similar hormone herbicides 2,4,5-T, and MCPA occurred during World War II and was a case of multiple discovery by four groups working independently under wartime secrecy in the United Kingdom and the United States: William G. Templeman and associates at Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) in the UK; Philip S. Nutman and associates at Rothamsted Research in the UK; Franklin D. Jones and associates at the American Chemical Paint Company; and Ezra Kraus, John W. Mitchell, and associates at the University of Chicago and the United States Department of Agriculture. All four groups were subject to wartime secrecy laws and did not follow the usual procedures of publication and patent disclosure. In December 1942, following a meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture the Rothamsted and ICI workers pooled resources and Nutman moved to Jealott's Hill to join the ICI effort. The first scientific publication describing the 2,4-D structure and plant growth regulating activity was by Perey W. Zimmerman and Albert E. Hitchcock at the Boyce Thompson Institute, who were not the original inventors. The precise sequence of early 2,4-D discovery events and publications has been discussed. William Tempelman found that when indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), the naturally occurring auxin, was used at high concentrations, it could stop plant growth. In 1940, he published his finding that IAA killed broadleaf plants within a cereal field. MCPA was discovered at about that time by his ICI group.Andrew H. Cobb, John P. H. Reade. Herbicides and Plant Physiology. Wiley-Blackwell; 2nd edition (October 25, 2010) In the USA, a similar search for an acid with a longer half life, i.e., a metabolically and environmentally more stable compound, led to 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4,5-T), both phenoxy herbicides and analogs of IAA. Robert Pokorny, an industrial chemist for the C.B. Dolge Company in Westport, Connecticut, published their synthesis in 1941. All the novel auxins were developed as part of a clandestine wartime effort to create chemical warfare agents and / or selective herbicides; although 2,4-D was not used this way during the war. Britain and the United States were looking for a chemical to starve Germany and Japan into submission by killing their potato and rice crops, but 2,4-D was found to be ineffective for that purpose, because both crops are tolerant of it. Within a year after the war ended, 2,4-D was commercially released as an herbicide to control broadleaf weeds in grain crops such as rice and wheat, and in the 1950s it was registered in the United States to control size and enhance skin colour in potatoes without affecting yields. The first publication of 2,4-D's use as a selective herbicide came in 1944. The ability of 2,4-D to control broadleaf weeds in turf was documented soon thereafter, in 1944.Mitchell JW, Davis FF and Marth PC (1944) Turf and weed control with plant growth regulators. Golfdom 18:34-38. Starting in 1945, the American Chemical Paint Company brought 2,4-D to market as an herbicide called \\"Weedone\\". It revolutionized weed control, as it was the first compound that, at low doses, could selectively control dicotyledons (broadleaf plants), but not most monocotyledons ‚Äî narrowleaf crops, such as wheat, maize (corn), rice, and similar cereal grass crops. At a time when labor was scarce and the need for increased food production was large, it literally \\"replaced the hoe\\". 2,4-D is one of the ingredients in Agent Orange, an herbicide that was widely used during the Malayan Emergency and the Vietnam War. However, 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), a contaminant in the production of another ingredient in Agent Orange, 2,4,5-T, was the cause of the adverse health effects associated with Agent Orange. In the 2000s, Dow AgroSciences developed a new choline salt version of 2,4-D (2,4-D choline) that Dow included in its \\"Enlist Duo\\" herbicide along with glyphosate and an agent that reduces drift; the choline salt form of 2,4-D is less volatile than 2,4-D.Josh Flint for Prairie Farmer. August 31, 2011 Dow AgroSciences Names Its Newest Herbicide Offering Enlist Duo Manufacture 2,4-D is a member of the phenoxy family of herbicides. 2,4-D is manufactured from chloroacetic acid and 2,4-dichlorophenol, which is itself produced by chlorination of phenol. Alternatively, it is produced by the chlorination of phenoxyacetic acid. The production processes may create several contaminants including di-, tri-, and tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin isomers and N-nitrosamines, as well as monochlorophenol. Containers of 2-4 D herbicide, ca. 1947 Mode of action 2,4-D acts by mimicking the action of the plant growth hormone auxin, which results in uncontrolled growth and eventually death in susceptible plants. It is absorbed through the leaves and is translocated to the meristems of the plant. Uncontrolled, unsustainable growth ensues, causing stem curl-over, leaf withering, and eventual plant death. 2,4-D is typically applied as an amine salt, but more potent ester versions exist, as well. Effect of 2-4-D foliar application  Applications  2,4-D is primarily used as a selective herbicide which kills many terrestrial and aquatic broadleaf weeds, but not grasses. As it was discovered in the 1940s, a patent no longer governs the manufacture and sale of 2,4-D, and any company is free to produce it. Thus, it is sold in various formulations under a wide variety of brand names. 2,4-D can be found in commercial lawn herbicide mixtures, which often contain other active ingredients including mecoprop and dicamba. Over 1,500 herbicide products contain 2,4-D as an active ingredient.EPA Last revised March 30, 2007 EPA Chemical Summary: 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid (2,4-D) Estimated use of 2,4-D in the USA to 2017 A wide variety of different sectors uses products containing 2,4-D to kill weeds and unwanted vegetation. In agriculture, it was the first herbicide found to be capable of selectively killing weeds but not crops. It has been used since 1945 to control broad-leafed weeds in pastures, orchards, and cereal crops such as corn, oats, rice, and wheat. Cereals, in particular, have excellent tolerance to 2,4-D when it is applied before planting. 2,4-D is the cheapest way for farmers to control winter annual weeds by spraying in the fall, often at the lowest recommended rate. This is particularly effective before planting beans, peas, lentils, and chickpeas. The estimated use of 2,4-D in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Survey. In 2017, the latest date for which figures are available, this reached annually. In domestic lawn and garden maintenance, 2,4-D is commonly used for weed control in lawns and other turf. It is used to kill unwanted weeds such as dandelions, plantain, clover, and chickweed. In forestry, it is used for stump treatment, trunk injection, and selective control of brush in conifer forests. Along roadways, railways, and power lines, it is used to control weeds and brush which might interfere with safe operation and damage equipment. Along waterways, it is used to control aquatic weeds that might interfere with boating, fishing, and swimming or clog irrigation and hydroelectric equipment. It is often used by government agencies to control the spread of invasive, noxious, and non-native weed species and prevent them from crowding out native species, and also to control many poisonous weeds such as poison ivy and poison oak. A 2010 monitoring study conducted in the US and Canada found that \\"current exposures to 2,4-D are below applicable exposure guidance values.\\" 2,4-D has been used in laboratories for plant research as a supplement in plant cell culture media such as MS medium since at least 1962.Murashige, T. and F. Skoog. A revised medium for rapid growth and bioassays with tobaccotissue cultures. Physiol. Plantarum 1962. 15:473-97. in: 2,4-D is used in plant cell cultures as a dedifferentiation (callus induction) hormone. It is classified as an auxin plant hormone derivative. Health effects Men who work with 2,4-D are at risk for abnormally shaped sperm and thus fertility problems; the risk depends on the amount and duration of exposure and other personal factors.NIOSH. Updated June 2014. The Effects of Workplace Hazards on Male Reproductive Health =Acute toxicity= According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, \\"The toxicity of 2,4-D depends on its chemical forms, including salts, esters, and an acid form. 2,4-D generally has low toxicity for humans, except certain acid and salt forms can cause eye irritation. Swimming is restricted for 24 hours after application of certain 2,4-D products applied to control aquatic weeds to avoid eye irritation.\\" the median lethal dose or LD50 determined in acute toxicity rat studies was 639 mg/kg.US EPA 2,4-D Reregistration Eligibility Decision, 2005. Associated RED Fact sheet EPA Urinary alkalinisation has been used in acute poisoning, but evidence to support its use is poor. =Cancer risk= The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies 2,4-D as a possible carcinogen to humans while the United States Environmental Protection Agency does not. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), said 2,4-D was classified as \\"possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), based on inadequate evidence in humans and limited evidence in experimental animals\\". In June 2015 the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer confirmed its 1987 classification of 2,4-D as a possible carcinogen.Carey Gillam for Reuters. June 22, 2015 WHO unit finds 2,4-D herbicide 'possibly' causes cancer in humans On August 8, 2007, the EPA issued a ruling that existing data do not support a link between human cancer and 2,4-D exposure. A 1995 panel of 13 scientists reviewing studies on the carcinogenicity of 2,4-D had divided opinions. None of the scientists thought the weight of the evidence indicated that 2,4-D was a \\"known\\" or \\"probable\\" cause of human cancer. The predominant opinion indicated that it is possible that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans, although not all of the panelists believed the possibility was equally likely: one thought the possibility was strong, leaning toward probable, and five thought the possibility was remote, leaning toward unlikely. Two panelists believed it unlikely that 2,4-D can cause cancer in humans. In a prior 1987 report the IARC classified some chlorphenoxy herbicides including 2,4-D, MCPA and 2,4,5-T as a group as class 2B carcinogens - \\"possibly carcinogenic to humans\\".Chlorphenoxy Herbicides (Group 2B) in IARC monographs on the evaluation of carcinogenic risks to humans: An updating of IARC Monographs volumes 1 to 42. Supplement 7, WHO, Lyon, France 1987. =Contaminants= A July 2013 Four Corners investigation found elevated levels of dioxins in a generic version of 2,4-D, one of Australia's most widely used herbicides. One scientist said the product tested by Four Corners, which was imported from China, had \\"one of the highest dioxin readings for 2,4-D in the last 10 to 20 years, and could pose potential health risks.\\" Metabolism When radioactively labeled 2,4-D was fed to livestock, 90% or more of the total radioactive residue (TRR) was shed in urine unchanged or as conjugated forms of 2,4-D. A relatively small portion of 2,4-D was metabolized into dichlorophenol, dichloroanisole, 4-chlorophenoxyacetic acid (6.9% of the TRR in milk), and 2,4-dichlorophenol (5% of the TRR in milk; 7.3% of the TRR in eggs and 4% of the TRR in chicken liver). Residue levels in kidney were the highest. Environmental behavior Owing to the longevity and extent of use, 2,4-D has been evaluated several times by regulators and review committees.Andrew Pollack for the New York Times. April 9, 2012 E.P.A. Denies an Environmental Group‚Äôs Request to Ban a Widely Used Weed Killer Quote: \\"The E.P.A. has reviewed the safety of 2,4-D several times, particularly with regard to an increased risk of cancer.\\" 2,4-D amine salts and esters are not persistent under most environmental conditions.National Pesticide Information Center NPIC 2,4-D Technical Fact Sheet The degradation of 2,4-D is rapid (half life of 6.2 days) in aerobic mineral soils. 2,4-D is broken down by microbes in soil, in processes that involve hydroxylation, cleavage of the acid side- chain, decarboxylation, and ring opening. The ethyl hexyl form of the compound is rapidly hydrolyzed in soil and water to form the 2,4-D acid. 2,4-D has a low binding affinity in mineral soils and sediment, and in those conditions is considered intermediately to highly mobile, and therefore likely to leach if not degraded. In aerobic aquatic environments, the half life is 15 days, while in anaerobic aquatic environments, 2,4-D was moderately persistent to persistent (half life of = 41 to 333 days). 2,4-D has been detected in streams and shallow groundwater at low concentrations, in both rural and urban areas. Breakdown is pH dependent. Some ester forms are highly toxic to fish and other aquatic life. \\"The ester forms of 2,4-D can be highly toxic to fish and other aquatic life. 2,4-D generally has moderate toxicity to birds and mammals, is slightly toxic to fish and aquatic invertebrates, and is practically nontoxic to honeybees\\" per EPA. =Microbial breakdown= A number of 2,4-D-degrading bacteria have been isolated and characterized from a variety of environmental habitats.Cavalca, L., A. Hartmann, N. Rouard, and G. Soulas. 1999. Diversity of tfdC genes: distribution and polymorphism among 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid degrading soil bacteria. FEMS Microbiology Ecology 29: 45-58. Metabolic pathways for the compound‚Äôs degradation have been available for many years, and genes encoding 2,4-D catabolism have been identified for several organisms. As a result of the extensive metadata on environmental behavior, physiology, and genetics, 2,4-D was the first herbicide for which the bacteria actively responsible for in situ degradation were demonstrated. This was accomplished using the technique of DNA-based stable isotope probing, which enables a microbial function (activity), such as degrading a chemical, to be linked with the organism‚Äôs identity without the need to culture the organism involved. Regulation  Maximum residue limits were first set in the EU in 2002 and re-evaluated in 2011 by the European Food Safety Authority, which concluded that the codex maximum residue limits were \\"not expected to be of concern for European consumers\\". The total chronic exposure represented less than 10% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI). Concern over 2,4-D is such that it is currently not approved for use on lawns and gardens in Denmark, Norway, Kuwait, and the Canadian provinces of Qu√©bec and Ontario. 2,4-D use is severely restricted in the country of Belize. In 2008, Dow AgroScience, LLC, sued the Canadian government for allowing Quebec to ban 2,4-D, but settled in 2011. In 2005, the US EPA approved the continued use of 2,4-D. On July 10, 2013, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency in Canada updated the re- evaluation notice of 2,4-D, stating that the 2,4-D registrants had provided it with required data and deemed them acceptable. On April 18, 2012, EPA denied the petition filed November 6, 2008, by the Natural Resources Defense Council to revoke all tolerances and to cancel all registrations of 2,4-D. EPA stated that recent new study and EPA‚Äôs comprehensive review confirmed EPA‚Äôs previous finding that the 2,4-D tolerances are safe at anticipated exposure. The estimated annual use of 2,4-D in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Service. In October 2014, the US EPA registered Enlist Duo, an herbicide containing the less volatile 2,4-D choline salt, glyphosate, and an antidrift agent, for use in six states: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.EPA Press Release. October 15, 2014 EPA Announces Final Decision to Register Enlist Duo, Herbicide Containing 2, 4-D and Glyphosate/Risk assessment ensures protection of human health, including infants, children EPA Documents: Registration of Enlist Duo In November 2015, the EPA attempted to withdraw its own approval of Enlist Duo, as a result of legal actions against both the agency and Dow by two U.S. groups. However, while it was implied that the approval was \\"gone\\" because of the action, in fact, Enlist Duo was still approved pending a decision by the courts. On January 25, 2016, the US Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied EPA's motion to vacate its Enlist Duo registration. Dow stated the product would be available in 15 US states and Canada for the 2016 crop season. On 21 August 2013, the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) banned selected 2,4-D high volatile ester (HVE) products due to their environmental hazards. HVE 2,4-D products had already been banned in Europe and North America for 20 years; low volatile ester products continue to be available in Australia and worldwide. In July 2013 APVMA published their report findings. Genetically modified crops In 2010, Dow published that it had created genetically modified soybeans made resistant to 2,4-D by insertion of a bacterial aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase gene, aad1.Mark A.

It is said that Conrad III barely escaped being named after his father's friend Juan Belmonte.Philip G.

Education Conrad graduated from the Taft School in Watertown, Connecticut, then studied painting and illustration at Yale University, under Lester Johnson and Maurice Sendak.\\"Barnaby Conrad III: LIFE AQUATIC, Nov 19, 2009 - Jan 16, 2010\\", artnet; retrieved 2011-09-14. Early career After graduating Yale with a B.A. in Fine Arts in 1975, Conrad worked as a journalist and magazine editor. His first published story was about his experiences running with the bulls in Pamplona, which he sold to the San Francisco Examiner for $100. Much of his work was for art magazines: he was one of the founding editors of Art World in the 1970s, and a senior editor of Horizon from 1979-80. In 1982, Conrad moved to Paris and became an adventure travel writer. He wrote articles about riding trains across India, skiing in the Alps, and hot air ballooning over Germany, for magazines such as Cond√© Nast Traveler, and Forbes Life, for which he served as editor-at-large. Book author Conrad's first book credit was as an illustrator of his father's children's book, Zorro - A Fox in the City, in 1971. He co-authored a book of interviews with photographers in 1977, then didn't write any more books until Absinthe: History In a Bottle, in 1988, his first book as a solo author. As of 2011, Conrad has authored over 11 non-fiction books, and hundreds of magazine articles for over 30 publications.\\"Staff: Barnaby Conrad III\\" , Barnaby Conrad III, Santa Barbara Writers Conference, June 18‚Äì23, 2011; retrieved 2011-09-14.\\"The San Franciscans: Barnaby Conrad III\\", Hank Donat, MisterSF, 2011; retrieved 2011-09-14.

He was a Doctor of Chemistry, academician of the National Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, and was the president of the National Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. Biography Yusif Haydar oglu Mammadaliyev was born on December 31, 1905, in Ordubad, Nakhchivan AR. In 1923, he entered the higher pedagogical institute of Baku. In 1926, after successful graduation from the institute he taught at secondary school for 3 years. In 1929, he became a second-year student of chemistry faculty of MSU, from which he graduated in 1932. He was the student of N.D.Zelinsky and A.A.Balandin and one of the first seniors of the laboratory of organic chemistry of chemistry faculty's organic chemistry cathedra with ‚Äúorganocatalysis‚Äù speciality. On the termination of MSU he worked in Moscow at the chemical plant No.1, and then was transferred to Azerbaijan, where he managed the Cathedra of organic chemistry of the agricultural college of Azerbaijan at first. Then he worked (1933‚Äì1945) at the Azerbaijan Research Institute of Oil, where he became the manager of laboratory. Perfect talent of the young scientist was discovered there. His work was dedicated to scientific problems of petrochemistry and organocatalysis and was closely connected with the development of domestic oil-refining and petrochemical industry. Some developments assumed as the basis of new industrial processes. Starting from 1934, he led the great pedagogical work at Azerbaijan University named after S.M.Kirov, sequentially holding the positions of associate professor, professor, head of a cathedra and rector (1954‚Äì1958). In 1933, Candidate of Chemistry was conferred on Yusif Mammadaliyev without defend of dissertation. In 1942, he became the Doctor of Chemistry and in 1943, the professor; in 1945, the academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR (from the establishment of academy). He was the director of Oil Institute of the Azerbaijan SSR. In 1946, he was nominated to the work in the Ministry of Oil Industry of the USSR, where he became the chairman of scientific-technical council of the ministry. In 1951-1954, he was the academician-secretary of physics, chemistry and oil departments of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR, in 1954-1958, the rector of Azerbaijan State University. In 1947-1951 and 1958-1961 Yusif Haydar oglu Mammadaliyev was chosen the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. The Institute of Petrochemical Processes was established in Baku on Yusif Mammadaliyev's initiative. In 1958, Yusif Mammadaliyev was chosen the corresponding member of the Academy of Sciences of the Azerbaijan SSR. He was honoured with many governmental awards. The highest award-the Order of Lenin-was presented to him during the Great Patriotic War for active work of supporting the front with important petrochemical products. Y.H.Mammadaliyev died in 1961. Awards He was honoured with the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner of Labour, the Order of Glory and also with medals. Scientific effort The main scientific works of Yusif Mammadaliyev are related to catalytic progressing of oil and oil gas. He is the founder of petrochemistry in Azerbaijan. He suggested new methods of chlorination and bromination of different hydrocarbons with participation of catalysts and especially showed the ways of obtaining carbon tetrachloride, chloromethane, dichloromethane and other valuable products by means of chlorination of methane, initially in stationary catalyst, and then in hot layer. Researches in the sphere of catalytic alkylation of aromatic, paraffinic, naphthenes hydrocarbons with the help of unsaturated hydrocarbons, enabled the synthesis of the components of aviation fuels on industrial scale. The major works were executed in the sphere of catalytic aromatization of benzine fraction of Baku oil, obtainment of washing agents, flint-organic compounds, production of plastics from pyrolized products, analysis of Naftalan oil‚Äôs action mechanism. Mammadaliyev rendered great services for highly skilled personnel‚Äôs training. He repeatedly represented Azerbaijan in congresses, conventions and symposiums held by the USSR, the USA, Italy, France, England, the MDR, the PRP and other countries. Formation of Azerbaijani Astrophysical Observatory, Fund of Manuscripts, Sumgayit Scientific Center of Chemistry and other scientific institutions of Azerbaijan are related to the name of Yusif Mammadaliyev. The school of petrochemistry of Azerbaijan founded by him is famous beyond the borders of the republic, too. The township named after Yusif Mammadaliyev was established near the Shamakhi Astrophysical Observatory (Pirgulu). Yusif Mammadaliyev is the author of more than 200 scientific works and 6 monographs.

(The river Meuse is the Maas in Dutch, and this name is also often used in English. It Latin sources it is called the Mosa.) The only relatively clear source concerning the location of this tribe is Pliny the Elder's Natural History. They are in a list of tribes living in the \\"Gaulish islands\\" within the river delta region between different mouths of the Rhine. First he mentions the islands of the Batavians and the Cananefates, and then he gives the list of people who he says are stretched out along 100 Roman miles, between the mouths Helinius and Flevus. Possibly related to this same tribe, he also mentions \\"Oromarsaci\\", possibly referring to an \\"ora\\" (boundary) of the Marsaci, near modern Boulognes-sur-mer, so they may have stretched down the Flemish coast.Pliny the Elder. The Natural History (eds. John Bostock, H. T. Riley, Esq., B.A. 1855) Book IV. An account of countries, nations, seas, towns, havens, mountains, rivers, distances, and peoples who now exist of formerly existed. Chap. 31. (17.) - Gallia Belgica. In English, or in Latin: \\"a scaldi incolunt texero texuandri pluribus nominibus, dein menapi, morini ora marsacis iuncti pago qui gesoriacus vocatur\\". The Helinius (or Helinium) is understood to have been the main mouth of the Meuse, where the main water of the southern branch of the Rhine, the Waal (Latin Vacalis) also discharged. Flevus (or Flevum) was a Roman fortification on the Ocean, north of the Rhine, mentioned by Tacitus, and equated today with Velsen. Although the details are no longer clear there was apparently a northerly outlet of the Rhine here, north of the main Old Rhine.Germania By Cornelius Tacitus, 4.72 But the term Flevo was also used by Pomponius Mela to refer to the fresh water lakes which were in the area of the modern Zuiderzee, which Mela specifically says that the Rhine fed into, perhaps through an ancient version of the Vecht, or the IJssel. So the Rhine mouth mentioned by Pliny might have been a discharge into a lake, or perhaps water running to Flevum on the coast may have arrived from the Rhine, via the lakes. The tribes of this stretch of delta islands are mentioned in this order: Frisii, Chauci, Frisiavones, Sturii and Marsacii. Of these:- *The Frisii are traditionally treated as the ancestors of the modern Frisians, although this is questioned, and they also did not necessarily live in exactly the same part or parts of what is now the Netherlands. Pliny in this passage is describing them being far to the south of medieval and modern Frisia. Tacitus describes there being two populations of them, but still both north of the Rhine. In any case, this tribe in Pliny's list will have been on the north. *The Chauci were also to the north of the delta, and are thought to be ancestors of the later Saxons. According to Tacitus, the Chauci inhabited a large part of northwestern Germany. A part of their population stretched towards the northeast of the Rhine delta area, and had contact with the Roman empire. *The Frisiavones, perhaps related to the Frisii, appear twice in Pliny, once amongst the delta island dwellers, and once amongst the tribes living to the south, in Belgic Gaul. For this reason they appear to have lived in the southeast of the delta, towards modern Belgium, neighbouring the Batavians, the Tungri, and possibly the Betasii and Sunuci. The Sturii and the Marsacii therefore probably lived further from the Rhine border, to the south or east of the above 3 tribes, or the Batavi and Cananefates. Other records mention the Marsacii being effected by the Batavian revolt implying that they lived close to the Batavians.Tacitus History 4.56 Also, the Roman emperors recruited their horse guard from a group of tribes including the Batavians, Cugerni, Frisiavones and the Marsacii. It has been claimed on the one hand that there might be a link to an earlier named Germanic tribe, from far to the east, known as the Marsi. Somewhat more positively considered is the proposal that the name of the Marsacii is preserved in the name of a medieval gau which was named Marsna. This was to the north of the mouth of the Maas into the North Sea.

It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with that of St Martin's Church, Bowness-on-Windermere; St Anne‚Äôs Church, Ings; St Cuthbert's Church, Kentmere; St James' Church, Staveley and Jesus Church, Troutbeck. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History The church originated as a proprietary chapel, built for Revd J. A. Addison from Liverpool in 1847‚Äì48. This was a simple structure, consisting of a nave, a chancel, and a south porch, with a bellcote over the chancel arch. In 1852 a south aisle, designed by Miles Thompson, was added. Revd Addison then had financial problems, and he sold the church to the town in 1855. It was consecrated as a parish church during the following year. Following this, a number of alterations and additions were made by the Manchester architect J. S. Crowther. In 1858 a north aisle and porch were added, followed by an extension to the west of the nave in 1861. In 1871 the Lancaster architects Paley and Austin restored the church, added a chancel and a vestry, and installed an alabaster and mosaic reredos. They also reseated the church, increasing its capacity from 536 to 656. In 1881‚Äì82 the same architects carried out work at the east and west ends of the church, and added a central tower. By this time the only remaining parts of the original chapel were the nave roof and the south porch, which had been rebuilt outside the south aisle in 1852. Internal alterations were carried out in 1945, including the removal of the reredos. A northeast vestry designed by George Pace was added in 1961. After a fire in 1988, which destroyed the nave roof, the church was restored by Michael Bottomley in the following two years. In 2005‚Äì06 the interior of the church was reordered by Paul Grout. The aisles were partitioned behind glass to make separate spaces, and a corridor was built at the west end of the church to link the aisles. The south transept was converted into a refreshment area, served by a kitchen in the south aisle. A new altar and communion rails were built, and were sited beneath the central tower. The pipe organ was removed and replaced by an electronic organ. Architecture =Exterior= St Mary's is constructed in slate stone with sandstone dressings and slate roofs. Its plan is cruciform, consisting of a nave, north and south aisles under separate roofs, north and south porches, north and south transepts, a chancel, two vestries, and a tower at the crossing. The tower is in three stages, with a stair turret rising to a higher level at the southeast corner. In the lowest stage, on the north and south sides, are pairs of two-light transomed windows. The middle stage contains clock faces in lozenge-shaped frames on the north and south sides, and two round-arched lancet windows in the east and west sides. In the top stage are two-light bell openings on each side, flanked by blind arches. At the top of the tower is a parapet with a quatrefoil frieze, and a small pyramidal roof. The five-light east window is in Decorated style. At the top of the east gable is a small stone cross. Along the north aisle are buttresses, two-light Geometric-style windows and a porch. The north transept has a three-light window, and an adjacent apsidal vestry. Along the south aisle are windows, some of which are lancets, the others containing plate tracery, and a gabled porch. In the south transept is blind arcading containing slit windows. At the west end of the church are three buttressed gables, each with topped by a small stone cross. The west window has four lights, and in each of the aisles is a two-light window; all have Decorated tracery. =Interior= The arcades between the nave and the aisles have seven bays. The arches in the north arcade have pointed arches, and those in the south arcade have round arches. The arcades to the transepts have two bays. The south aisle contains a kitchen, a meeting room and a toilet; the north aisle has been converted into a parish office, a reception area, and a lounge. The furniture, other than the recently added altar and communion rails, was designed by Paley and Austin. The choir stalls are decorated with pierced friezes, and have poppyhead finials. The wooden pulpit is polygonal, and is decorated with a frieze of pierced tracery. The font consists of a square bowl in an octagonal stem, with black marble shafts at the corners. The stained glass in the east window dates from 1893, and is by Burlison and Grylls. It depicts the Sermon on the Mount. There is stained glass in other windows by different designers.

Grasso was a 32-year-old male double murderer executed by lethal injection at Oklahoma State Penitentiary, McAlester, Oklahoma, United States, on March 20, 1995. He strangled Hilda Johnson, an 87-year-old woman, using her Christmas tree lights on December 24, 1990, in her Tulsa home. He stole $8 from her purse, $4 in loose change, and her television set which he sold for $125. Six months later, after moving to New York with his wife, Lana, he murdered Leslie Holtz, an 81-year-old man from Staten Island, on July 4, 1991, stealing his Social Security check. Arrest and conviction New York detectives investigating the murder of Leslie Holtz arrested Grasso and within two weeks he had confessed to police. He first told investigators about the Staten Island killing, then about the murder of Hilda Johnson. Grasso pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 20 years to life on April 21, 1992. The New York legislature had passed legislation which would have restored the state's death penalty, but governors Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo, who were both morally opposed to the death penalty, vetoed the legislation. Extradition and execution Grasso's case became an issue in George E. Pataki's gubernatorial campaign and 11 days after Pataki took office, Grasso was extradited, fulfilling the new governor's campaign pledge. Pataki and Governor Frank Keating of Oklahoma, both Republicans, signed an agreement that allowed Oklahoma correction officials to take custody of Grasso at Buffalo International Airport. Prison officials escorted him on a commercial flight to the state penitentiary at McAlester via Tulsa, on January 11, 1995. Grasso spent his last days on the normal prison schedule, confined for 23 hours a day to his 14- by 18-foot cell in the prison's Death Row (H-unit), which he shared with 49 other condemned men. He was allowed one hour's exercise per day and three showers per week. =Final day= On the day before his execution, Grasso released four statements to the press. The first, at 3:00 p.m., read, \\"What we call the beginning is often the end, and to make an end is to make a beginning. The end is where we start from.\\" The second, released at 8:25 p.m., read, \\"For most of us, there is only the unattended moment, the moment in and out of time. And right action is freedom from the past and future also.\\" The first part of the second statement is a line from T.S. Eliot's \\"The Dry Salvages\\". Shortly before 10:00 p.m., three hours before his execution time, he issued the third statement in the form of a light-hearted poem commemorating his forthcoming dispatch. The poem was entitled \\"A Visit with Mystery\\":A Visit with Mystery =Last meal= Grasso was executed at Oklahoma State Penitentiary Grasso's last meal was two dozen steamed mussels, two dozen steamed clams (flavored by a wedge of lemon), a double cheeseburger from Burger King, a half-dozen barbecued spare ribs, two strawberry milkshakes, one-half of a pumpkin pie with whipped cream, diced strawberries, and he requested a can of SpaghettiOs with meatballs though he used his last words to claim that kitchen staff did not honor this request. Less than an hour before he died, he issued his fourth and final statement, \\"I did not get my SpaghettiOs, I got spaghetti. I want the press to know this\\". =Execution= Just before 1:00 a.m. (EST) on March 20, 1995, Grasso walked from his cell to the execution chamber. The witnesses, including Grasso's lawyers and 12 reporters, sat in an adjoining room. About 1:00 a.m., with Grasso strapped to the gurney, warden Ron Ward picked up a phone in the witness room and spoke to Governor Keating, who granted permission to proceed from his official residence in Oklahoma City.

The bond issue is sponsored by a government entity but the proceeds are directed to a private, for-profit business. Bond Structure An IRB differs from traditional government revenue bonds, as the bonds are issued on behalf of a private sector business. IRBs are typically used to support a specific project, such as a new manufacturing facility. The bond issue is created and organized by a sponsoring government, with the proceeds used by the private business. The business is responsible for bond repayment. The sponsoring government holds title to the underlying collateral until the bonds are paid in full. In some cases, this arrangement may provide a federal tax exempt status to the bonds, and many times a property tax exemption on the collateral. The sponsoring government is not responsible for bond repayment and the bonds do not affect the government‚Äôs credit rating. IRBs are desired as the private business receives a lower interest rate (due to the bonds tax-exempt status), a property tax exemption, and a long-term, fixed rate financing package. Bond proceeds may be used for a variety of purposes, including land acquisition, building construction, machinery and equipment, real estate development fees, and the cost of bond issuance. IRS Statute In the United States IRBs are governed by IRS statute and include the following provisions: * The maximum amount of bonds that may be issued or outstanding is US$10 million. * Total capital expenditures at the project site may not exceed US$20 million total * Total IRBs outstanding at the company in the U.S. may not exceed US$40 million total See also * Revenue bond * Municipal bond References Category:Bonds (finance) ","title":"Industrial revenue bond"},{"id":"33084896","text":"Detrez, the year before his death Conrad Detrez (1 April 1937 Roclenge-sur- Geer ‚Äì 11 February 1985 Paris) was a Belgian (from 1982 on French) journalist, diplomat and novelist. Biography Conrad Detrez grew up in a small village in the Belgian countryside. In 1962 he traveled to Brazil as a lay missionary. He first stayed in Volta Redonda and from 1963 in Rio de Janeiro. He was a university teacher while at the same time working in the favelas. He discovered his homosexuality and gradually became involved in the resistance to the military dictatorship that was installed in 1964 in Brazil. After being arrested and expulsed from Rio de Janeiro in 1967, Detrez stayed some months in Paris, participating in the revolt of May 68. He returned to S√£o Paulo where he became a journalist. In 1969 he secretly met and interviewed Brazilian guerrilla leader Carlos Marighella. In the 1970's Detrez stayed in Algeria (as a teacher) and in Lisbon (as a radio journalist) after the Portuguese Carnation Revolution. Before his writing career Detrez translated books by the Brazilian writers Jorge Amado and Antonio Callado. In 1978 he won the Prix Renaudot for his autobiographical novel L'Herbe √† br√ªler. In 1982 Detrez became a diplomat for the French government in Nicaragua. He died of AIDS. Critical reception Poet James Kirkup found Le dragueur de Dieu 'beautifully written in a fluent, lucid and visionary manner' and praised the mixture of religious sensuality and intellectual mysticism. 'Writers in other countries seem able to reconcile sexual and religious themes in their works in a way that is rarely found in English or American authors.'The Times Literary Supplement, 4 September 1981. Lydia Davis translated two of Detrez's novels into English. A weed for burning was labeled in The Los Angeles Times an 'extremely ambitious novel'.Los Angeles Times, 4 november 1984. 'Detrez is still an unfinished writer,' claimed Time Magazine.Time, 17 September 1984. 'But he has a sense of the appropriate image and the right valedictory tone.' The Village Voice praised his 'effectiveness as a storyteller'.The Village Voice, 17 July 1984. Chilean historian Rafael Pedemonte calls Detrez 'a thrilling figure, unfairly forgotten after his premature death'.http://hahr- online.com/interview-rafael-pedemonte-meeting-of-revolutionary-roads-chilean- cuban-interactions-1959-1970/ Works * Carlos Marighella, Conrad Detrez, Pour la liberation du Bresil Aubier-Montaigne, 1970. * M√°rcio Moreira Alves, Conrad Detrez, Carlos Marighella, Zerschlagt die Wohlstandsinseln der Dritten Welt, Rowohlt, 1971. *Les p√¢tres de la nuit: roman, Stock, 1975. *L'herbe √† br√ªler: roman, 1977; Labor, 2003. **A weed for burning, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1984. *Caballero ou l'irr√©sistible corps de l'homme-dieu, Galerie Jade, 1980. *La lutte finale, Balland, 1980; Balland, 1996. *Le dragueur de Dieu: roman, Calmann-L√©vy, 1980. *Les Noms de la tribu, Seuil, 1981 *Le m√¢le ap√¥tre: po√®mes, Persona, 1982 *La guerre blanche: roman, Calmann-L√©vy, 1982. *La ceinture de feu: roman, Gallimard, 1984. **Zone of fire, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1986. *La m√©lancolie du voyeur, Deno√´l, 1986. *Ludo: roman, Labor, 1988. *Les plumes du coq, Actes sud, 1995.

The Grand Contournement is actually composed of two incomplete and partially overlapping rings of motorways (Autoroutes) and A-roads (Routes National) known as the \\"First solution\\" and \\"Second solution\\" and ranging from 80 to 200 km distance from Paris. Originally planned to be completed in 2006 the \\"Second Solution\\" currently stretches in a clockwise direction for 826 km from Bourges to Troyes. The two rings overlap briefly as they pass through Rouen and again using the A26 autoroute between Reims and Troyes. A section of A26 between Troyes and Auxerre which would partially complete the Second Solution to Autoroute standard is not currently a high priority project and progress is envisaged only well after 2020 while no schedule exists for the remaining section of A26 between Auxerre and Bourges which is not programmed for construction at all. While the A26 is considered incomplete the N77 and N151 are used to complete the outer ring. The second solution has a length of nearly 1115 km and the tolls cost ‚Ç¨67.80 as of 1 October 2011. Although a complete ring, the First Solution uses Routes National which are a mixture of single lane and dual carriageway for its northern and western sides. The N154 on the western side of the First Solution is (as of 2020) being upgraded to 2x2 dual carriageway with proposed bypasses to the east of Chartres and to the west of Dreux.  Future Improvements  A proposed motorway bypass to the east of Rouen (Contournement de Rouen Est) aims to construct a motorway- standard link of 44kms length between the A13 and A28 autoroutes by 2024, to be named A133 and A134.

Development having developed the all-metal single-seat Partenavia Aeroscooter earlier, Mario de Bernardi sought to improve the design as the two-seat M.d.B. 02 Aeroscooter was developed as a aircraft to be built by CAP in Bergamo, Italy. Design The Aeroscooter is a low-wing, two-seat monoplane. The partial welded steel tube fuselage uses aluminum skins. The wing uses a wood spar. The tricycle landing gear uses trailing link suspension. The single-piece plexiglas canopy slides forward to open. All fuel is housed in the header tank and main tank behind the passenger's seat. Operational history The prototype was built by De Bernardi with the assistance of two mechanics. In April 1959, De Bernardi died of a heart attack after flying a demonstration of the prototype at Rome Urbe Airport. An example is on display at Museo Aeronautico Caproni di Taledo, Milano. Variants The daughter of De Bernardi is offering plans for a modernized version of the Aeroscooter using a Rotax 912UL engine to be flown under Italian microlight category.

Definition A simple radical extension is a simple extension F/K generated by a single element \\\\alpha satisfying \\\\alpha^n = b for an element b of K. In characteristic p, we also take an extension by a root of an Artin‚ÄìSchreier polynomial to be a simple radical extension. A radical series is a tower K = F_0 < F_1 < \\\\cdots < F_k where each extension F_i / F_{i-1} is a simple radical extension. Properties # If E is a radical extension of F and F is a radical extension of K then E is a radical extension of K. # If E and F are radical extensions of K in a common overfield C, then the compositum EF is a radical extension of K. # If E is a radical extension of F and E > K > F then E is a radical extension of K. These three properties show that the class of radical extensions is a distinguished class of field extensions. Solvability by radicals Radical extensions occur naturally when solving polynomial equations in radicals. In fact a solution in radicals is the expression of the solution as an element of a radical series: a polynomial f over a field K is said to be solvable by radicals if there is a splitting field of f over K contained in a radical extension of K. The Abel‚ÄìRuffini theorem states that such a solution by radicals does not exist, in general, for equations of degree at least five. √âvariste Galois showed that an equation is solvable in radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable. The proof is based on the fundamental theorem of Galois theory and the following theorem. The proof is related to Lagrange resolvents. Let \\\\omega be a primitive nth root of unity (belonging to K). If the extension is generated by \\\\alpha with x^n-a as a minimal polynomial, the mapping \\\\alpha\\\\mapsto \\\\omega\\\\alpha induces a K-automorphism of the extension that generates the Galois group, showing the \\"only if\\" implication. Conversely, if \\\\phi is a K-automorphism generating the Galois group, and \\\\beta is a generator of the extension, let :\\\\alpha=\\\\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\\\\omega^{-i}\\\\phi^i(\\\\beta). The relation \\\\phi(\\\\alpha) = \\\\omega\\\\alpha implies that the product of the conjugates of \\\\alpha (that is the images of \\\\alpha by the K-automorphisms) belongs to K, and is equal to the product of \\\\alpha^n by the product of the nth roots of unit. As the product of the nth roots of units is \\\\pm 1, this implies that \\\\alpha^n\\\\in K, and thus that the extension is a radical extension. It follows from this theorem that a Galois extension may be expressed as a radical series if and only if its Galois group is solvable. This is, in modern terminology, the criterion of solvability by radicals that was provided by Galois. The proof uses the fact that the Galois closure of a simple radical extension of degree n is the extension of it by a primitive nth root of unity, and that the Galois group of the nth roots of unity is cyclic.

Juju focuses on reducing the operation overhead of today's software by facilitating quickly deploying, configuring, scaling, integrating, and performing operational tasks on a wide choice of public and private cloud services along with bare metal servers and local container based deployments. Juju modeling complex software topologies  Juju's mission is to provide a modeling language for users that abstracts the specifics of operating complex big software topologies. Doing so reduces the cost of operations and provides flexibility. A Juju Model is an environment to manage and operate a set of software applications. Models can be operated on many clouds: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, etc. A Juju Controller is the service that tracks the events, state, and user activity across multiple models. You can think of it a bit like a database server where the controller is the server and models are different databases available on that server. Each model can have different configuration, sets of operating software, and different users with access at various levels. Some examples of models could be a web application, load balancer, and database in a \\"web-app\\" model. By using models deployments can be isolated into logical solutions and managed separately. Juju can also be used to operate software on bare-metal servers by using Canonical's Metal as a Service, in containers using LXD, and more. Juju models provide an abstraction with allows the operations know-how to be cloud agnostic. This means that Charms and Bundles can help operate the same software with the same tooling on a public cloud, private cloud, or a local laptop.  Juju charms  The central mechanism behind Juju is called Charms. Charms can be written in any programming language that can be executed from the command line. A Charm is a collection of YAML configuration files and a selection of \\"hooks\\". A hook is a naming convention to install software, start/stop a service, manage relationships with other charms, upgrade charms, scale charms, configure charms, etc. Charms can have many properties. Charm helpers allow boiler-plate code to be automatically generated hence accelerating the creation of charms.  Juju client and environments  Juju has two components: a client and a bootstrap node. Currently clients exist for Ubuntu, CentOS, Mac and Windows. After installing the client, one or more environments can be bootstrapped. Juju environments can be bootstrapped on many clouds: Amazon Web Services, HP Cloud Services, Microsoft Azure, OpenStack, etc. By creating a Juju Provider, additional cloud environments can be supported. Juju can also be bootstrapped on bare-metal servers. Large deployments can use Canonical's Metal as a Service. Small deployments can use the manual provider, which allows any SSH Ubuntu machine to be converted into a Juju-managed machine. Juju can also be installed on a local Ubuntu machine via LXC operating system‚Äìlevel virtualization and the local provider.  Command line and GUI  Juju has both a command line and a GUI. The GUI allows users to visually see what software is currently running in which models in a very clear fashion. It also gives the user the power to search the Charmstore and browse results with detailed Charm information presented. It also allows the deployment of complex software stacks via drag-and-drop. The Juju GUI is automatically available on every controller.  Bundles  Juju also has a concept of Bundles. A Bundle is a portable specification for a model with charms, configuration, and relations all specified in a declarative YAML format. A Bundle YAML file can later be imported into another Juju model and shared with others. Bundles can also be uploaded to the charm store, allowing anybody to deploy a bundle via drag-and-drop or one command. In this example bundle, two applications are modeled; mediawiki, and mysql. Users can modify attributes declared in the bundle to customize their deployment: services: mediawiki: charm: cs:trusty/mediawiki-3 num_units: 1 options: debug: false name: Please set name of wiki skin: vector mysql: charm: cs:trusty/mysql-29 num_units: 1 options: binlog-format: MIXED dataset-size: 80% tuning-level: safest series: trusty relations: \\\\- - mediawiki:db \\\\- mysql:db  Charm Store  The Juju Charm Store launched on April 3, 2012. The Charm Store regularly tests charms to notify charm authors when code breaks in addition to ensuring that Juju users have access to the latest versions of charms.  Supported platforms  Juju is available on Ubuntu server, with agents available for Ubuntu, CentOS and Microsoft Windows. Support for both CentOS and Windows has been contributed by Cloudbase Solutions.

It was painted for the Ufficio della Gabella (\\"Office of the Tax\\") of the commune of Siena, as specified by two-line signature at the bottom (the painter named himself Ambruogio Lorenzi). It was originally located in the Consistory Hall of the Palazzo Pubblico. Description Lorenzetti chose for his painting an unusual moment of the Annunciation of Mary: the moment in which the angel (according to the Gospel of Luke) explains her how the conception could happen, and in which the conception itself occurs. The angel, in fact, is saying the Latin words: Non est (erit) impossibile apud Deum omne verbum (\\"Nothing is impossible for God's word\\"), which are visible between his mouth and the Virgin's chest. The Virgin, looking upwards, replies: Ecce Ancilla Domini (\\"Here Is God's Maid\\"). The style is that of late Lorenzetti's works (after 1335) executed in Siena. The rather realistic use of geometrical perspective in the pavement is similar to that in the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple (1342). The use of chiaroscuro in the faces and the drapes shows the influence of Giotto, which he had acquired during his stay in Florence (before).

It is one of the largest works by the Italian medieval painter, as well as one of the five which he signed and dated. History The painting originally decorated the altar of St. Crescentius in the Cathedral of Siena, and had been commissioned as part of a cycle of four altarpieces dedicated to the city's patrons saints (St. Ansanus, St. Sabinus of Spoleto, St. Crescentius and St. Victor) during 1330-1350. These included the Annunciation with St. Margaret and St. Ansanus by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi, the Nativity of the Virgin by Pietro Lorenzetti (1342, Altar of St. Sabinus), and a Nativity, now disassembled, attributed to Bartolomeo Bulgarini from 1351 (altar of St. Victor). All the paintings should represent stories of the Life of the Madonna, and were crowned by Duccio di Buoninsegna's Maest√†. The use of expensive lacquer in the paintings and lapis lazuli shows the prestige of the commission. Two 15th century descriptions mention the work as a triptych, with two side panels portraying St. Michael Archangel and St. Crescentius Martyr (who held his head in a hand) and, below, a predella. A century later, artists including Giovanni di Paolo and Bartolo di Fredi executed copies of the painting. It was later disassembled and placed in a nunnery in Siena. Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany had his transferred to Florence in 1822. It became part of the Uffizi collection in 1913. Description The painting depicts the presentation at the temple, an event which, according to the Hebraic Law, should occur forty days after a child's birth, to allow the mother to purify herself. Within two central, slender columns are the Madonna (holding the cloth in which the child was kept), the child (with moving feet and a finger in the mouth), and Simeon the Righteous, who is speaking and taking the child in his arms. At the far left is Joseph, preceded by two women: the latter have no aureolae, to mark that they have no holy status. At the right is Anna, accompanied by a Latin cartouche with a citation from the Gospel of Luke (2:38- And coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.) Behind the altar is a priest with the doves for the sacrifice and, in the left hand, the knife. In front of him a flame is burning on the sacrifice altar. Two other priests are partly visible at his left behind the architectural elements. The scene is set within church, finely decorated in Gothic style (somewhat similar to the Cathedral of Siena) with a nave and two aisles, each surmounted by three-foiled ogival arches. Above the priests, within the church, is a triumphal arch with two angels; they hold a clipeus with the Blessing Christ. The lunettes of the aisles show prophets with cartouches, while above the columns in the foreground are depicted two small statues of Moses, with the table of the Ten Commandments, and Joshua, with the Sun in his hand. In the upper part, above the marble intarsia of the arches and frieze with dragons, is a series of angels with a garland. Finally, the central top arch includes the figures of Moses and Malachi, who also have cartouches with Latin verses taken from the Bible.

Although historically somewhat equal to men, after the Spanish conquest the culture in what is now Peru became increasingly patriarchal. The patriarchal culture is still noticeable. Women receive less pay than men, have fewer employment and political opportunities, and are at times abused without repercussion. Contraceptive availability is not enough for the demand, and over a third of pregnancies end in abortion. Maternal death rates are also some of the highest in South America. The Peruvian Government has begun efforts to combat the high maternal mortality rate and lack of female political representation, as well as violence against women. However, the efforts have not yet borne fruit. History Andean civilization is traditionally somewhat egalitarian for men and women, with women allowed to inherit property from their mothers. After the Spanish conquered the Inca Empire, the culture became more patriarchal; and the resulting society has been described as being machista. During the republican revolutions in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the concept of separate spheres (private vs. public) became a legally debated issue in Peru. Determining a clear distinction of the boundaries between private crimes and public crimes became significant because only public crimes could be directly prosecuted by the state. During this time, public crimes were crimes that affected the state or society, while private crimes only harmed the individual committing the act. Although all civil cases were considered to be private, some private crimes could potentially affect the public. Crimes such as theft and inflicting serious bodily injuries had previously only been prosecuted by the wishes of the plaintiff; however, during the early republic, these crimes were pursued based on the prosecutors‚Äô and judges‚Äô own agendas. In contrast, crimes such as slander, rape, or anything related to honor was treated the same as before. Victims of these crimes had to do substantially more work than victims of theft and serious physical injuries. In order for their case to be considered, these victims had to report their cases themselves, and had to file a formal complaint as well as provide witnesses. These plaintiffs were expected to decide whether the crime itself or reporting the crime to the court would create greater harm to their honor. Even though there could be circumstances in which rape or seduction would disturb society enough to make it a public crime, to give prosecutors the power to file charges would \\"disturb the peace and secrecy that should exist in the domestic sphere.\\" For the same reason, physical injuries resulting from the \\"punishment\\" of dependence (servants, wives, children) were usually considered \\"private\\", crimes and the rights of the perpetrators carried more weight than the protections due to the victims, who were not, after all, citizens. Even as republican judicial officials tried to balance the demands of public and domestic order, they continue to trend, begun with the Bourbon reforms, of increasingly claiming jurisdiction in those cases pertaining to marriage, family, and sexual honor, in which the affected parties did press charges. Formerly, such cases had fallen primarily within the jurisdiction of the church. During this republican state, men who were contributed to the public sphere and were either married, between the age of 21 and 25, owned property, had an independent profession, or paid taxes were granted ‚Äúcitizenship status.‚Äù This enabled them to easily obtain protection of their civil liberties. Women, on the other hand, did not receive the same benefits because their roles were confined to the private sphere. The labor traditionally done by women (sewing, cooking, child-rearing, etc.) became worthless because it was no longer recognized as a public contribution, but just a part of the private (patriarchal) system in Peru. Legally, women held little protections, as it was seen as their husband or father's job to protect them. Legally, women were not protected by the new system. As a result of this, they faced many hardships. For example, domestic abuse was an ongoing problem mainly because abuse and rape were considered to be ‚Äúprivate crimes.‚Äù The state classified these heinous acts this way because they did not want to disrupt the male patriarchal society. Women were mainly defined by their sexual purity and domestic serving abilities. Poor women, in particular, had a hard time conforming to the ‚Äúrepublican mother‚Äù look and could not base claims on their rights or duties as mothers. Furthermore, if they were convicted of a crime, they were seen as ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù and were often prevented from being released early from prison. Although women like Maria Toledo and Juana Pia fought to be released early because of good behavior and because they were the sole supporter of their children, the prosecutor argued that the women would negatively influence their children. On the contrary, men were seen as the hard-working provider for the family and received more advantages than women. For example, a few months before Toledo‚Äôs petition was denied, an ‚Äúhonorable man‚Äôs‚Äù sentence was reduced because his wife had indicated on the appeal that he was her family‚Äôs sole provider. This misogynist system prevailed for many decades. On June 17, 1956, Peruvian women voted for the first time in general elections, after years of mobilization by women like Mar√≠a Jes√∫s Alvarado, Adela Montesinos, Zoila Aurora C√°ceres, Elvira Garc√≠a y Garc√≠a, and Magda Portal, among others. Peru was the next-to-last country in Latin America to fully enfranchise women. During the internal conflict in Peru beginning in the 1980s, some families became matriarchal, with approximately 78 percent of migrant families being headed by women. In shantytowns, women established soup kitchens (comedores) and worked together to ensure that their families received enough food to eat. The abuses during the conflict have caused both mental and physical problems in women. Identification papers, necessary for the execution of civil rights like voting, were also destroyed en masse. , approximately 18.1 percent of Peruvian women are living without the necessary documents, as opposed to 12.2 percent of men. Even today, women from indigenous tribes may be treated disrespectfully by authority figures. The same applies to poor women. In the ninetieth century Peru, women were treated as if their lives had been divided in two different ways. One part of a woman‚Äôs life was considered private which included the work that women did and how they were treated inside the home. By declaring the work that women do as private, this then lowers their status in Peru being their work was not valued. Private work was not a way for women to gain a larger role of independence. The other part of a woman‚Äôs life was considered public, and in this case, it was hard for women to fulfill a large amount of public activity. Public activity for women was a tough area being that women‚Äôs work was worthless therefore, they were not important in the community.Mentioned in, Caulfield, Sueann, et al. ‚ÄúPrivate Crimes, Public Order: Honor, Gender, and the Law in Early Republican Peru.‚Äù Honor, Status, and Law in Modern Latin America, Duke University Press, 2005, pp. 33‚Äì37. Forced sterilization Forced sterilization against indigenous and poor women has been practiced on a large scale in Peru. The Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, published in 2003, notes that during the internal conflict in Peru, there were numerous cases of women being forcibly sterilized - also, another estimated up to 300,000 mostly rural women were sterilised under deception or with insufficient consent in the 1990s as part of a campaign intended to combat poverty. President Alberto Fujimori (in office from 1990‚Äì2000) has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration. During his presidency, Fujimori conducted a program of forced sterilizations against indigenous Quechuas and the Aymaras women, under the guise of a \\"public health plan\\". Education School girls in Peru Female literacy is lower than male literacy in Peru: only 94.3% of females (15 and older) are literate, compared to 97.2% of males, according to 2016 estimates. Indigenous women of Peru travel less than men. As such, they tend to be less fluent in Spanish, the national language of Peru. This may lead to difficulties when they must speak with outsiders, who often do not speak the indigenous language. Although women have a higher illiteracy rate than men, an increasing number of women are receiving higher education. Demographics Women are a slight minority in Peru; in 2010 they represented 49.9 percent of the population. Women have a life expectancy of 74 years at birth, five years more than men. Latest estimates suggest that the population of Peru is Amerindian 45%, mestizo (mixed Amerindian and white) 37%, white 15%, black, Japanese, Chinese, and other 3%. More than 8 out of 10 people are Catholics. Although Peru has an ethnically diverse population, discrimination by ethnic lines is common, particularly against amerindians and blacks; gender often interacts with ethnic origin; this may mean that \\"an indigenous woman may only ever work as a maid\\". Maternal and reproductive health Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Peru Women who live in poverty are less likely to give birth in a health center or be attended by a health care worker. Peru has one of the highest maternal death rates in South America, with the government noting 185 deaths per 100,000 live births, and the United Nations estimating the number at 240 per 100,000 live births. In order to combat those high figures, the government released a strategic plan in 2008 to reduce the total to 120 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Of these maternal deaths, 46 percent occur during the first six weeks after birth. Amnesty International notes that economic discrimination is one of the factors, with women in affluent areas receiving better health care than those in rural areas. Gender and ethnic discrimination in health care also exist. border According to the 2007 census, the causes of maternal death in Peru were as follows: The age of consent in Peru has changed several times during recent years, and has been subject to political debates, but today it is fixed at 14, regardless of gender and/or sexual orientation, in accordance with a 2012 decision of the Constitutional Court of Peru. Teenage pregnancies are not uncommon. They are often the result of rape by a male relative. When giving birth, indigenous mothers may avoid going to clinics due to unfamiliarity with the techniques used. They instead prefer to use traditional practices, with which they are comfortable. The lack of health staff able to speak indigenous languages is also a problem. Although contraceptives are used in Peru, they are more common in urban areas. An estimated 13.3 percent of women in rural areas are in need of contraceptives that are unavailable, as opposed to 8.7 percent of urban women. Although therapeutic abortion is legal, and an estimated 35 percent of pregnancies result in abortion, regulation and implementation has been controversial, with the only clear guidelines (in Arequipa) withdrawn under pressure from anti- abortion groups. There have been instances where mothers have been forced to carry babies to term at large personal risk. The HIV/AIDS rate in Peru was estimated in 2012 at 0.4% of adults aged 15‚Äì49. Family life Girl with her alpaca near the Plaza de Armas in Cusco, Peru By law, Peruvian women must be 16 years old to marry; prior to 1999, it was 14. A 2004 survey by the United Nations estimates that 13 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 19 have been married. In marriage, the husband and wife share responsibility for household affairs. In approximately 25% of marriages, finances are handled by the husbands; in some other families the mother is the head of the household. Some ethnic groups, such as the Ash√°ninka, practice polygamy. Despite the fact that married Peruvian men occasionally openly take lovers, divorce is difficult to obtain. In a divorce, custody of children under the age of seven is generally awarded to the mother. Custody of those over seven is generally awarded by gender. If a parent is deemed unfit, the children can be sent to live with the other parent.  Domestic violence  The OECD notes that women in Peru are subject to abuse, with almost half suffering from violence. The most common form of abuse is psychological. There are also reports of female genital mutilation as a rite of passage during puberty. The government has attempted to address the issues, establishing the National Programme against Family Violence and Abuse in 2001, and passing a law requiring local authorities to deal with domestic abuse and stipulating punishments for rape and spousal rape. Legal action against perpetrators of abuse is slow and ineffectual. In 1999 Peru repealed the law which stated that a rapist would be exonerated, if after the assault he and his victim married. The principal law dealing with domestic violence is Ley de Protecci√≥n frente a la Violencia Familiar (Law for Protection from Family Violence).http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/peru.dv.97.pdf It was first enacted in 1993, has been strengthened in 1997, and thereafter modified several times, in order to broaden its scope: by 2010, this law had already been amended five times.http://www.justice.gov/eoir/vll/country/canada_coi/peru/PER103441.FE.pdf Some abusive husbands were caught in the general rise in criminal prosecution, particularly when their drunken or violent behavior threatened public as well as domestic order. In 1852, for example, shoemaker Laurencio Salazar was arrested for knocking his wife unconscious. Salazar, on previous occasions not only injured his wife but also killed animals for spite and cut his brother- in-law's hand, was dangerously violent. The republican courts defined vaguely the level of violence necessary to constitute assault in domestic cases. Between 1784 and 1824, there were only two worthy cases filed by mothers de parte under the category of physical or verbal violence but neither made it till the end. In opposition, about half of accused rapists after independence were convicted despite their efforts. Going further, the penalties for rape convictions were \\"generally stricter than those for nonsexual assault: several months in jail while performing public labor and/or providing a dowry for the young woman\\". Economy The majority of rural women work in farming, or take care of household chores. On average, they earn 46 percent less than male workers. Beginning in the 1990s, women increasingly entered service industries to replace men. They were hired because the employers could pay them less and believed that they would not form unions. During that period, labour rights were revoked for women workers. Gender equality A woman in Lima, Peru Discrimination based on gender is forbidden by the government of Peru, and a piece of legislation was passed in 2000 that outlawed discrimination. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that discrimination is practiced, in particular with regard to women's land rights, and that women in Peru generally have higher levels of poverty and unemployment. Those who have jobs have difficulty holding senior positions. The OECD has rated the degree of gender discrimination in Peru as low on the Social Institutions and Gender Index. Informal land-dispute resolution systems are common, and rural women are often discriminated.http://usaidlandtenure.net/sites/default/files/country- profiles/full-reports/USAID_Land_Tenure_Peru_Profile.pdf Women's access to land is not well protected; in 2002, only 25 percent of land titles were given to women, and under an \\"informal ownership\\" system the husband may sell property without his wife's consent. In 2014, new laws have improved the access of indigenous people to land. Politically, women in Peru have been subordinated to men and had little power. Twenty percent of those elected in 2001 were women. Female politicians are often from richer families, as women from a lower income bracket must deal with housework. Recent laws have required a quota of representatives in Congress to be women. Despite this, the levels of women's political representation remain below the 30% quota target.http://www.idea.int/americas/peru/lima_workshop.cfm As of 2014, there were 22.3% women in parliament.

Computhink originally offered their document management solution under the name \\"The Paperless Office\\" on a 32-bit SQL database. In the year 2000, Computhink launched ViewWise and rebranded ViewWise in 2013; creating Contentverse 8 and its cloud version: Contentverse Cloud. Contentverse enables users to create an electronic filing system composed of cabinets, drawers, and folders, using index keys to manage and search a multitude of documents. Contentverse fully enables users to reduce paper use and move to an electronic document management solution. A paperless office is a more efficient, cost- saving, compliant organizational strategy. Company history Computhink Incorporated was founded in 1994 near Chicago, Illinois. The company originally sold a high security identification card production and management software program called IDtel. In their first year, Computhink sold one hundred IDtel systems to the United Nations for $1 million and became their sole ID tag provider. After the success with IDtel, Computhink created their first image viewing and management software program, The Paperless Office, in 1995. This was the first 32-bit software package designed for personal, single user, image viewer and image management use. Originally sold as a single user system, The Paperless Office was later developed to be used as a multiple user system. By 1996, Computhink had operating offices in Chicago, London, Kuwait, South Africa, and Moscow with 85 total employees and consultants, and annual revenue exceeded $15 million. The single-user product was phased out, and network versions for small businesses were created and offered. As customer needs changed, Computhink moved from image management to document management. The reseller channel was developed in the United States and Internationally. Between 1998 and 1999, The Paperless Office and IDtel were sold in 29 countries, across six continents. At this time, Computhink purchased Whetstone Technologies, the primary partner of Novell, to further expand their market presence. The Paperless Office was re-developed in Java and launched as ViewWise, the first ever server-based image-enabling product in the industry. In 2000, ViewWise became Novell‚Äôs preferred imaging partner, and Computhink decided to forego any involvement with the Whetstone Technologies products. The network for domestic and international resellers was updated and broadened in 2006. Computhink became qualified as a Microsoft Front Runner, allowing them to release solutions alongside Microsoft‚Äôs product line. By 2008, Computhink had begun incorporating partnerships and connections with Kodak, Canon, and other third party viewers that complemented document management software. Computhink reached Tier III for the United Nations. In 2013, the staff at Computhink realized that since 2006, the market‚Äôs needs and interests had shifted from document management to content management. Despite consistent updates and enhancements of ViewWise, the company decided to take the next step. The product was rebranded to Contentverse as the eighth version of the software. In 2014, version 8.1 of Contentverse was released.

Doha municipality came into being in May 1963. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs was established in 1972 as a government body responsible for supervising the functions of municipalities. Decree No 4 for 1963 organized, for the first time, the election and appointment of the members of the municipal council. Law No 11 for 1963 followed. It stipulated that the municipal council is formed by a decree and that the appointment of the members is based on the nomination of the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture. The first joint meeting of municipal councils in the country was held in 1983. Most of the credit goes to this meeting in deciding to form a central municipal council to replace the numerous municipal councils. The council consists of 29-member civic body which has a four-year term and has representatives from all the 29 civic constituencies in the country. Introduction In 1952, the first municipal council was formed, and was restructured in 1956. Doha municipal council was formed in May 1963, after the government conceded to protests by nationalist movements. It was the first ever municipal council which was designed to elect members. In 1972, the Municipalital Affairs was established, functioning as a supervisory authority over the municipal affairs. The idea to form the municipal council by direct elections was revived when the Emir of Qatar Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani decreed Law No 12 for 1998 which issued the election of the members of the Central Municipal Council. The emir also issued the Emiri Decree No 17 for 1998 on the election of the members of the Central Municipal Council. Several committees were subsequently formed. They included the legal, security, and information, technical, supply, and follow up committees. A preparatory committee was also formed under the patronage of the wife of the Emir to carry out an awareness program for women, emphasizing the importance of their participation in the elections both as candidates and voters. The election experience was very well received publicly and officially and the response was overwhelming by all sectors of the Qatari society, males and females alike. The participation of women as voters and candidates invited a wide-range and favorable echo, locally and internationally. 35 Arab and foreign parliamentarians were hosted to oversee the conduct of the first elections in the country. The Qatari democratic practice exceeded the surrounding experiences in four aspects: voting age was brought down to 18, which expands the scope of participation in the democratic process, the Qatari media was utilized in an unprecedented manner in the Persian Gulf region by giving live coverage of the debates and discussions between candidates and voters, women were allowed to participate as voters and candidates for the first time and a headquarters was provided in each constituency, where the 29 members of the Council can hold discussions and meetings with their electorates. Voting Regulations The Emiri Decree No 17 for 1998 specified the regulations governing the elections of the members of the Central Municipal Council. All Qatari males and females that fulfill the following conditions have the right to cast their votes: # They must be of Qatari origin, or have been naturalized citizens for a period of at least 15 years. # They must be 18 years of age. # They must not be indicted on a criminal charge of breach of trust or honesty. Otherwise they must have been rehabilitated. # The constituency must be the real place of residence for respective voters. # They must not be members of the armed forces or security forces. The Council is formed of 29 members representing constituencies spreading over 230 regions in the State of Qatar. The membership term in the Council is 4 years. The Council Sessions On the 4th of May 1999 Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al-Thani, the Emir of the State of Qatar issued a decree inviting the Central Municipal Council to hold its first meeting in full attendance to elect the Council's Chairman and Deputy Chairman from among its members by secret ballot. The Council holds its ordinary meetings in Doha and in public once every two weeks. Extraordinary meetings must be requested by one third of the members. The meetings are considered regular only where the quorum of two thirds of the members is available. The maximum period for which a meeting can be put off for lack of quorum is three days, after which the meeting can be held with the attendance of one third of the members. The Council issues its resolutions by plurality of votes. Under the supervision of the Chairman, the Council forms a Secretariat General and appoint a Secretary General. The job of the Secretary General is to prepare the meetings' agenda and submit thereof to the Chairman, record the minutes of the meetings and the Council's recommendations and submit, to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture, those parts of the recommendations that call for his or any higher authority's action. The Council's Authorities The Central Municipal Council is an independent entity. The Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture has no authority over its functions. It is totally free to practice its responsibilities without any interference from the Ministry. The roles of the Ministry and the Council complement each other. The role of the Council is still one of advisory and monitoring. The Council has the right to discuss all matters and problems, and its agenda is not confined to what is raised by the Ministry. The Ministry approves the recommendations of the Council, whose members decide their own work program and budget without external interference. Both the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture and the Central Municipal Council coordinate their efforts to reach the common goal of serving the country and the citizens. The Minister of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture explains the different points of view to the Council through a specialized committee. In case the difference in opinion persists, subjects of discord, accompanied by the two different viewpoints, are raised to the Council of Ministers for consideration. The 29 members of the Council focus their attention on providing the compelling needs of the society and securing the basic services with a view to rationalize spending. They do that through a well-defined plan and good coordination of time, effort and resources, and through giving priority to projects like road building, sanitary drainage, parks and recreation sites. =Central Municipal Council Secretary General= The secretary-general of the Central Municipal Council is to be appointed by the State Cabinet and his powers are to be specified by it. This authority was earlier held by Minister of Municipality and Urban Planning. The Advisory Council earlier made extensive recommendations to amend Law No. 12 and incorporate the above changes. The job of the Secretary General is to prepare the meetings' agenda and submit thereof to the Chairman, record the minutes of the meetings and the Council's recommendations and submit, to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Agriculture, those parts of the recommendations that call for his or any higher authority's action. Central Municipal Council contest requirements The law (No. 1 of 2011) was issued by the Deputy Emir and Heir Apparent, H H Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, on Thursday 20th Jan 2011. The legislation amends Law No. 12 of 1998 regulating the Central Municipal Counciland the amendments were made on the recommendations of the Advisory Council. It is, however, not known if all the recommendations of the Advisory Council have been incorporated in the new legislation. =Age Limit= Qatar has raised the minimum age limit to 30 years from 25 for its citizens to contest Central Municipal Council elections. It was argued by the Advisory Council that since a man or woman is generally in a position to hold social responsibility only when he or she is 30, the minimum age to contest the CMC be raised to 30 years. =Place of residence= The Advisory Council's recommendation that a Central Municipal Council member must live in the constituency he represents is because he should be aware of local issues and knows local people. The new law also makes it mandatory for a candidate to contest from the constituency he is a permanent resident of and his name appears on the local voters' list. After a contestant wins the election, he or she needs to continue residing in the same constituency. =Employments= Members of the Advisory Council also suggested in their recommendations that no citizen who is employed with the police, paramilitary or defence forces or any government department be allowed to contest the Central Municipal Council poll. Election results =1st Municipal Council Elections in 1999= 248 candidates including 6 women contested the 4-year term of 29 seats.

Arnett was the founder and chairman of the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, an organization dedicated to the preservation and documentation of African American art from the Deep South that works in coordination with leading museums and scholars to produce groundbreaking exhibitions and publications using its extensive holdings. His efforts produced 13 books with nearly 100 essays by 73 authors. 38 museums have hosted major exhibitions, and comprehensive archives are maintained at UNC Chapel Hill. The White House has shown the collection. Arnett exhibited works from these collections and delivered lectures at over 100 museums and educational institutions in the United States and abroad. He is perhaps best known for writing about and collecting the work of African American artists from the Deep South. Arnett was named one of the \\"100 Most Influential Georgians\\" by Georgia Trend Magazine in January 2015.http://www.georgiatrend.com/January-2015/100-Most- Influential-Georgians/ He died on August 12, 2020.  Early life  Arnett was born in Columbus, Georgia, and attended the University of Georgia, where he earned a B.A. in English.  Collecting  After living in Europe in the mid-1960s, Arnett built an extensive collection of ancient Mediterranean art and antiquities. He also became interested in Asian art, and amassed works dating from 2000 B.C. to the 19th century. For a number of years, Arnett's main interest was African Art. He collected the ritual arts from West and Central Africa, particularly the numerous cultures of Nigeria, Benin (formerly Dahomey), the Cameroon Grassfields, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. In 1978, he co-authored the catalogue Three Rivers of Nigeria for Atlanta's High Museum of Art. In 1994, he donated a significant portion of his extensive collection of African art to the Michael C. Carlos Museum at Emory University, then under the direction of Maxwell Anderson. In the mid 1980s, Arnett began to collect the work of artists in the black American South, including pieces by such artists as Thornton Dial and Lonnie Holley. By the mid-1990s Arnett's efforts resulted in an ambitious project to survey the visual tradition of the African American South: an exhibition and two-volume book, titled Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South, which was ultimately presented at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta and remains the most in- depth, scholarly examination of this phenomenon. Subsequently, Arnett developed a series of related publications, including several books on the quilts created by women living in Gee's Bend, Alabama. He arranged for the first influential exhibition of those quilts at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston in 2002.\\"The Quilts of Gee¬¥s Bend (September 8 - November 10, 2002)\\" (exhibition file). MFAH Archives. Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. mfah.org. Retrieved 2 June 2018. The exhibition titled The Quilts of Gee's Bend was shown at 13 major U.S. museums including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the High Museum of Art, MFA Boston, the Milwaukee Museum of Art, the Cleveland Museum of Art, The Corcoran Gallery of Art and the DeYoung Museum. On November 24, 2014, The Metropolitan Museum of Art announced that 57 works by contemporary African American artists from the Southern United States were donated to the Museum by the Souls Grown Deep Foundation from its William S. Arnett Collection. An exhibition devoted to the gift took place at the Metropolitan Museum in fall 2016. As Sheena Wagstaff, Leonard A. Lauder Chairman of the Department of Modern and Contemporary Art at the Metropolitan Museum, described the gift, \\"From Thornton Dial's magisterial constructions to the emblematic compositions by the Gee's Bend quilters from the 1930s onwards, this extraordinary group of works contributes immeasurably to the Museum's representation of works by contemporary American artists and augments on a historic scale its holdings of contemporary art.\\" http://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-museum/press-room/news/2014/souls-grown- deep  Writing  As Arnett's collection of African American art grew, he became convinced that the so-called folk or outsider artists of the black American South were a coherent cultural movement and constituted a crucial chapter in world art. He spent years gathering extensive documentation and amassing a near-definitive collection of work crucial to the understanding of this cultural phenomenon. In the year 2000, in an effort to introduce southern black vernacular art to a wider audience, Arnett founded Tinwood Books; a year after the inauguration of its publishing program, Jane Fonda become a 50% owner in the firm.Reid, Calvin (June 18, 2001). \\"Jane Fonda Takes 50% Stake in Tinwood Books\\". Publishers Weekly. Vol. 248, issue 25. publishersweekly.com. Retrieved 2 June 2018 Under the Tinwood imprint, Arnett co-edited and co- authored, with his son Paul Arnett, Souls Grown Deep: African American Vernacular Art of the South, a massive book that featured over 1800 illustrations and ran to over 1000 pages in two volumes.Owusu-Ansah, Edward K.

The NSF compared cyberinfrastructure to physical infrastructure, \\"... the distributed computer, information and communication technologies combined with the personnel and integrating components that provide a long- term platform to empower the modern scientific research endeavor\\". In September 2013 it was announced that the National Science Foundation had renewed iPlant's funding for a second 5-year term with an expansion of scope to all non-human life science research. The project develops computing systems and software that combine computing resources, like those of TeraGrid, and bioinformatics and computational biology software. Its goal is easier collaboration among researchers with improved data access and processing efficiency. Primarily centered in the United States, it collaborates internationally.  History  Biology is relying more and more on computers. Plant biology is changing with the rise of new technologies. With the advent of bioinformatics, computational biology, DNA sequencing, geographic information systems and others computers can greatly assist researchers who study plant life looking for solutions to challenges in medicine, biofuels, biodiversity, agriculture and problems like drought tolerance, plant breeding, and sustainable farming. Many of these problems cross traditional disciplines and facilitating collaboration between plant scientists of diverse backgrounds and specialties is necessary. In 2006, the NSF solicited proposals to create \\"a new type of organization ‚Äì a cyberinfrastructure collaborative for plant science\\" with a program titled \\"Plant Science Cyberinfrastructure Collaborative\\" (PSCIC) with Christopher Greer as program director. A proposal was accepted (adopting the convention of using the word \\"Collaborative\\" as a noun) and iPlant was officially created on February 1, 2008. Funding was estimated as $10 million per year over five years. Richard Jorgensen led the team through the proposal stage and was the principal investigator (PI) from 2008 to 2009. Gregory Andrews, Vicki Chandler, Sudha Ram and Lincoln Stein served as Co-Principal Investigators (Co-PIs) from 2008 to 2009. In late 2009, Stephen Goff was named PI and Daniel Stanzione was added as a Co-PI. As of May 2014, Co-PI Stanzione was replaced by 4 new Co-PIs: Doreen Ware at Cold Spring Harbor, Nirav Merchant and Eric Lyons at the University of Arizona, and Matthew Vaughn at the Texas Advanced Computing Center. The iPlant project supports what has been called e-Science, which is a use of information systems technology that is being adopted by the research community in efforts such as the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS), ELIXIR, and the Bamboo Technology Project that started in September 2010. iPlant is \\"designed to create the foundation to support the computational needs of the research community and facilitate progress toward solutions of major problems in plant biology.\\" The project works as a collaboration. It seeks input from the wider plant science community on what to build. Based on that input, it has enabled easier use of large data sets, created a community-driven research environment to share existing data collections within a research area and between research areas and shares data with provenance tracking. One model studied for collaboration was Wikipedia. Several more recent National Science Foundation awards mentioned iPlant explicitly in their descriptions, as either a design pattern to follow or a collaborator with whom the recipient will work. See abstracts for awards #0849861, #0923975, #0940841, #0953184, #1027542, #1031416, #1032105, #1126481, #1126998. =Institutions= The primary institution for the iPlant project is the University of Arizona, located within the BIO5 Institute in Tucson. Since its inception in 2008, personnel worked at other institutions including Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, University of North Carolina, Wilmington, and the University of Texas at Austin in the Texas Advanced Computing Center. Purdue University and Arizona State University were part of the original project group. Other collaborating institutions that received support from iPlant for their work on a Grand Challenge in phylogenetics starting in March 2009 included Yale University, University of Florida, and the University of Pennsylvania. A trait evolution group was led at the University of Tennessee. A visualization workshop employing iPlant was run by Virginia Tech in 2011. The NSF requires that funding subcontracts stay within the United States, but international collaboration started in 2009 with the Technical University Munich and University of Toronto in 2010. East Main Evaluation & Consulting provides external oversight, advice, and assistance.  Services  The iPlant project makes its cyberinfrastructure available several different ways and offers services to make it the accessible to its primary audience. The design was meant to grow in response to needs of the research community it serves. =The Discovery Environment= The Discovery Environment integrates community- recommended software tools into a system that can handle terabytes of data using high-performance supercomputers to perform these tasks much more quickly. It has an interface designed to hide the complexity needed to do this from the end user. The goal was to make the cyberinfrastructure available to non-technical end users who are not as comfortable using a command-line interface. = iPlant Foundational APIs = A set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for developers allow access to iPlant services, including authentication, data management, high performance supercomputing resources from custom, locally produced software. = Atmosphere = Atmosphere is a cloud computing platform that provides easy access to pre-configured, frequently used analysis routines, relevant algorithms, and data sets, and accommodates computationally and data-intensive bioinformatics tasks. It uses the Eucalyptus virtualization platform. = iPlant Semantic Web = The iPlant Semantic Web effort uses an iPlant-created architecture, protocol, and platform called the Simple Semantic Web Architecture and Protocol (SSWAP) for semantic web linking using a plant science focused ontology. SSWAP is based on the notion of RESTful web services with an ontology based on Web Ontology Language (OWL). = Taxonomic Name Resolution Service = Screen shot of the DNA Subway tool The Taxonomic Name Resolution Service (TNRS) is a free utility for correcting and standardizing plant names. This is needed because plant names that are misspelled, out of date (because a newer synonym is preferred), or incomplete make it hard to use computers to process large lists. = My- Plant = My-Plant.org is a social networking community for plant biologists, educators and others to come together to share information and research, collaborate, and track the latest developments in plant science. The My-Plant network uses the terminology clades to group users in a manner similar to phylogenetics of plants themselves. It was implemented using Drupal as its content management system. = DNA Subway = The DNA Subway website uses a graphical user interface (GUI) to generate DNA sequence annotations, explore plant genomes for members of gene and transposon families, and conduct phylogenetic analyses. It makes high-level DNA analysis available to faculty and students by simplifying annotation and comparative genomics workflows. It was developed for iPlant by the Dolan DNA Learning Center.

See Old Book of Tang, vol. 179. Meanwhile, since his biography gave his death age as 61, an 839 birthdate will be used here.), courtesy name Xitu (Â∏åÂæí), formally the Baron of Pengcheng (ÂΩ≠ÂüéÁî∑), was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty, serving as a chancellor during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong.  Background  Liu Chongwang was probably born around 839, during the reign of Emperor Wenzong. His ancestors claimed ancestry from the Cao Wei-era Xiongnu prince Liu Qubei, and his traceable ancestors included officials of Northern Qi, Sui Dynasty, and Tang Dynasty, including the early Tang general Liu Zhenghui (). Both his grandfather Liu Zao () and father Liu Fu () were Tang officials as well, but neither was particularly prominent ‚Äî with Liu Zao serving as Mishu Lang (), an administrator at the Palace Library, and Liu Fu serving as a prefectural prefect.New Book of Tang, vol. 71. (According to a later statement by another chancellor, Li Xi, Liu Fu committed suicide after being investigated for bribery.)New Book of Tang, vol. 146. Liu Chongwang was the third of eight brothers; both of his older brothers Liu Chonggui () and Liu Chongyi (), as well as three younger brothers, Liu Chonglu (), Liu Chongmo (), and Liu Guƒ´ (), would serve as Tang officials as well; his other younger brothers were Liu Gu√¨ (ÂäâÁìå, note different tone) and Liu Yu ().Old Book of Tang, vol. 179. Liu Chongwang passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi class in 875, during the reign of Emperor Wenzong's cousin Emperor Yizong.  During Emperor Xizong's reign  During the reign of Emperor Yizong's son Emperor Xizong, when the imperial official Wang Ning () became the governor (ËßÄÂØü‰Ωø, Guanchashi) of Xuanshe Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠ô, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui), Liu Chongwang served on his staff as the surveyor of food supply missions to the capital Chang'an.The exact years when Liu would have served under Wang are unclear, but Wang's stint as governor of Xuanshe was clearly after his stint as the deputy minister of defense, and he was deputy minister of defense as of 874. He was still the governor of Xuanshe as of 878 and died at Xuanshe that year, putting a timeframe as to when Liu would have served under him. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 165; Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 252, 253. Later, when the imperial official Cui Anqian served as the military governor (Jiedushi) of Zhongwu Circuit (Âø†Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Xuchang, Henan) and then of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), he invited Liu and three of his brothers to serve on staff, and all four became known for being talented.It is unclear when Cui became the military governor of Zhongwu, but he was directly transferred to the military governorship of Xichuan from that post, and was recalled to Chang'an from Xichuan in 880, putting a timeframe on Liu's and his brothers' stints of service under him. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 177; Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Later, apparently after Cui was recalled to Chang'an, Liu followed him to Chang'an and served as sheriff of Chang'an County (one of the two counties making up the city) and was later made a scholar at Hongwen Pavilion (). When Cui served as the minister of civil service affairs, Liu served under him with the low-level titles of Sixun Yuanwailang () and then Libu Yuanwailang (), but was said to be instrumental in reforming the state of the ministry of civil service affairs at that time.Cui's biography does not mention when he served as the minister of civil service affairs, but it must be between his recall in 880 and semi-exile to the eastern capital Luoyang later that year, so Liu's service there would have been brief. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 177; Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 253. Liu's activities during the next few years ‚Äî which included tumultuous events including the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao's capture of Chang'an and Emperor Xizong's flight to Xichuan and subsequent return to Chang'an after Huang's defeatZizhi Tongjian, vol. 254.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 255. ‚Äî were not clear. As of 886, however, Emperor Xizong was caught up in a conflict between the powerful eunuch Tian Lingzi and the warlords Wang Chongrong the military governor of Huguo Circuit (Ë≠∑Âúã, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi) and Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi), and was forced to flee Chang'an again when Wang and Li defeated Tian and Tian's allies Zhu Mei the military governor of Jingnan Circuit (ÈùúÈõ£, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi) and Li Changfu the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi). After the emperor fled to Xingyuan (ËààÂÖÉ, in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), Zhu declared Li Yun the Prince of Xiang emperor at Chang'an, and for a while, it appeared that Emperor Xizong's court at Xingyuan would be defeated and replaced. With Tian having resigned and been replaced at the imperial court by Yang Fugong, whose late adoptive brother Yang Fuguang had worked closely with Wang, Emperor Xizong had Yang Fugong write a letter to Wang urging him to again support Emperor Xizong; Liu was in charge of carrying this letter to Huguo and persuading Wang, and he was successful in doing so, eventually leading to Emperor Xizong's prevailing over Li Yun and being able to return to Chang'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. For Liu's accomplishments, he was made an imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´, Hanlin Xueshi). He was later promoted to be the chief imperial scholar (Áø∞ÊûóÂ≠∏Â£´ÊâøÊó®, Hanlin Xueshi Chengzhi) and the deputy minister of census (Êà∂ÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Hubu Shilang), and later the deputy minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®‰æçÈÉé, Bingbu Shilang). It was said that he served as an imperial scholar for four years.  During Emperor Zhaozong's reign  In 889, by which time Emperor Xizong had died and been succeeded by his brother Emperor Zhaozong, Emperor Zhaozong made Liu Chongwang Zhongshu Shilang () ‚Äî the deputy head of the legislative bureau of government (‰∏≠Êõ∏ÁúÅ, Zhongshu Sheng) ‚Äî and chancellor, with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. Liu also successively served, while chancellor, as the minister of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Bingbu Shangshu) and minister of civil service affairs (ÂêèÈÉ®Â∞öÊõ∏, Libu Shangshu). In 890, when his chancellor colleague Zhang Jun and Kong Wei advocated a campaign against Li Keyong, Liu and another chancellor, Du Rangneng, opposed, but to no avail. After Li Keyong defeated the imperial troops and forced Emperor Zhaozong to remove Zhang and Kong, Liu remained chancellor, with his other posts changed to Menxia Shilang () ‚Äî the deputy head of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and acting director of the treasury (Áü•Â∫¶ÊîØ, Zhi Duzhi); he was also in charge of editing the imperial history. By 891, the relationship between Emperor Zhaozong and Yang Fugong had deteriorated to such a point that Emperor Zhaozong forced Yang Fugong into retirement but became apprehensive that Yang Fugong and his adoptive nephew (Yang Fuguang's adoptive son) Yang Shouxin () the commander of the Yushan Army () were planning a coup. He decided to act against Yang Fugong first by sending imperial guards under the officers Li Shunjie () and Li Shoujie () to attack Yang Fugong's mansion. However, the Yangs' soldiers were initially victorious. The other imperial guards, who were initially not involved in the battle, were planning to pillage the Chang'an markets in the confusion, but Liu met with them and persuaded them to be faithful to the emperor and join the battle against the Yangs, leading them personally. When the Yangs' soldiers saw that the other imperial soldiers were joining the battle, they collapsed and fled. Yang Fugong and Yang Shouxin fled to Xingyuan to join Yang Fuguang's adoptive son Yang Shouliang the military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered at Xingyuan) in an open revolt against the imperial government, but the Yangs were eventually defeated.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. Meanwhile, the warlords Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (ÂÆ£Ê≠¶, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) and Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (ÊÑüÂåñ, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) had been locked into years of warfare, and by spring 892, Shi was near defeat, with his capital Xu Prefecture () under intense siege by Zhu. He sued for peace, and Zhu initially agreed ‚Äî but demanded, as part of the peace terms, that he leave Ganhua. Zhu thereafter reported the situation to the imperial government and asked the imperial government to send a successor to Shi; in response, Emperor Zhaozong commissioned Liu as the new military governor of Ganhua, still carrying the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title, while recalling Shi to Chang'an. After Liu departed Chang'an, however, Shi came to believe that this was a trick by Zhu to get him out of Xu Prefecture to be killed, and so refused to leave the city; Liu turned around at Huayin (ËèØÈô∞, in modern Weinan, Shaanxi) and returned to Chang'an, but apparently did not resume his post as chancellor.New Book of Tang, vol. 63 . (Xu Prefecture subsequently fell to Zhu, and Shi committed suicide.) Liu was later given the post of minister of worship (Â§™Â∏∏Âçø, Taichang Qing). In 895, Wang Chongrong's brother and successor at Huguo, Wang Chongying, died, leading to a succession struggle between Wang Chongrong's adoptive son Wang Ke (biological son of another brother of Wang Chongrong's, Wang Chongjian (), whom the soldiers supported as Wang Chongying's successor, and Wang Chongying's son Wang Gong, who was then the military governor of neighboring Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan) but wanted the more important Huguo Circuit. Li Keyong supported Wang Ke, while Wang Gong was supported by Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang, Han Jian the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (ÈéÆÂúã, headquartered in modern Weinan), and Wang Xingyu the military governor of Jingnan. Emperor Zhaozong tried to resolve the dispute by commissioning the chancellor Cui Yin as the military governor of Huguo. Upon hearing the remarks, Li Keyong's liaison Xue Zhiqin () publicly stated, \\"While Lord Cui is honored and virtuous, but if there is to be a replacement to Wang Ke, it is better to name Lord Liu of Guangde, as my lord respects him.\\" (Liu was referred to as Lord Liu of Guangde because he lived at Guangde Block () Later in the year, when Li Maozhen, Wang Xingyu, and Han, upset that Emperor Zhaozong rejected their request, led their armies to Chang'an to force Emperor Zhaozong's hand and killed the chancellors Li Xi and Wei Zhaodu (whom they believed encouraged Emperor Zhaozong to resist them), they also forced Emperor Zhaozong to exile Liu to Zhao Prefecture (Êò≠Â∑û, in modern Guilin, Guangxi) to serve as the military advisor to the prefect. After Li Keyong defeated Wang Xingyu later that year and forced Li Maozhen and Han to reconcile with the imperial government,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. Li Keyong spoke on Liu's behalf, and Liu, who had reached Jingnan Circuit (ËçäÂçó, headquartered in modern Jingzhou, Hubei, not the same circuit Wang Xingyu ruled) on the way to exile, was recalled to Chang'an to serve as the minister of defense. In 897, warfare between Wang Jian the military governor of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan) and Gu Yanhui the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) resulted in Gu's total defeat and suicide. In spring 898, Emperor Zhaozong, hoping to seize control of Dongchuan back, commissioned Liu the military governor of Dongchuan Circuit. However, when Liu was on the way to Dongchuan, the imperial government heard that Wang had already commissioned his adoptive son Wang Zongdi as the acting military governor of Dongchuan. Not wanting to create a conflict with Wang Jian, Emperor Zhaozong recalled Liu to serve as the minister of defense again and made Wang Zongdi the military governor of Dongchuan.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. Liu probably died in 900 and was given posthumous honors. One of his sons, Liu Jun, later became a chancellor for the Southern Han state of the subsequent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period.Book of Southern Han (ÂçóÊº¢Êõ∏), vol. 10.

Hocking, featuring Robert E. Howard's sword and sorcery hero Conan the Barbarian. It was first published in trade paperback by Tor Books in November 1995; a regular paperback edition followed from the same publisher in September 1999. According to Hocking, he wrote the novel out of dissatisfaction with the Conan novels being published in the early 1990s, \\"trying to put into the story all the things I thought were missing from Conan pastiche at that time.\\" After taking three years to write it, he was proud enough of the result that he \\"didn't want to just drop it into a drawer ....[s]o I sent out a handful of letters, and L. Sprague de Camp responded ...that if I sent him my book he'd look it over. He liked it a lot and LOTUS was published.\\"Interview of John C. Hocking, January 2005, by Howard Andrew Jones, on Pitch Black Books' Sword & Sorcery website. Plot Having refused to enter the service of a Stygian wizard, Ethram-Fal, Conan suffers a curse which is gradually robbing him of his life. The beautiful sorceress, Lady Zelandra, offers to lift his curse if Conan retrieves for her a deadly emerald lotus which she is addicted to--currently in the possession of Ethram-Fal. To save his own life from the evil wizard, Conan must challenge Ethram-Fal again by stealing Zelandra's prize from his desert fortress. During his adventure, Conan faces off against bandits, a demon disguised as an oasis, and zombie bodyguards. He's aided in his quest by the dagger-throwing Neesa and a mute thief named Heng Shih. Reception According to Howard Andrew Jones, \\"If you were to ask Conan fans who wrote the best Conan story after Robert E. Howard, a lot of people would point to John Hocking. ... it is Hocking, above all, who consistently makes people's favorites list. ...

Club gives the collection an A- grade saying: \\"While the abruptness of the stories‚Äô conclusions go from rattling to occasionally repetitive, though, the openings are always fresh, as Doctorow skillfully shifts perspective and style to better examine how the same weaknesses that make us human can also rob us of our humanity.\\" Jess Row in The New York Times is not impressed, writing: \\"Doctorow‚Äôs novels tend to follow a deductive logic, beginning with the great themes of an era (or simply with a set of historical facts) and then dramatizing them in an interwoven ensemble of characters. Without a substantial dose of irony, short stories don‚Äôt work that way; the heavy-handedness of the novelist smashes them flat.\\" David L. Ulin for the Los Angeles Times sees some value in mixing the older stories with the new: \\"this too is in the nature of a new and selected, to operate as a bit of a grab bag, and in so doing to let us read the work anew. To be sure, that's the case with the six older stories, which trace, with grace and acuity, the tension between longing and obligation, between who we are and who we mean to be.\\" References Category:2011 books Category:Single-writer short story collections ","title":"All the Time in the World (book)"},{"id":"33085816","text":"Brand Finance is an independent branded business valuation consultancy. It advises branded organizations, or those with intangible assets, on how to maximize their value through effective management, of their brand and other intangible assets.Adding Brand Value Presentation Brand Finance has been certified with ISO 10668:2010.The International Organization for Standardization is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations. ISO 10668:2010 specifies requirements for procedures and methods of monetary brand value measurement.Full explanation of the ISO 10668:2010 , the company evaluates over 3,500 brands annually.  History Brand Finance was founded in 1996 by David Haigh, who qualified as a Chartered Accountant with Price Waterhouse in London. Prior to setting up Brand Finance, he was the Director of Interbrand‚Äôs global brand valuation practice in London. Brand Finance opened its first international offices in the US, Singapore and Australia in 2000, and now has a network of offices and partners in 20 countries worldwide.Brand Finance Offices  Methodology ISO 10668 specifies three alternative brand valuation approaches - the Market, Cost and Income Approaches.Brand Finance  What is the ISO 10668  Brand Valuation Analysis  Brand Finance - Press Releases The purpose of the brand valuation, the premise or basis of value and the characteristics of the subject brand dictate which primary approach should be used to calculate its value. For its annual league tables of the most valuable brands, Brand Finance employs a Royalty Relief methodology when calculating the value of a brand. The Royalty Relief approach is based on the assumption that if a company did not own the trademarks that it exploits, it would need to license them from a third party brand owner instead. Ownership therefore ‚Äòrelieves‚Äô the company from paying a license fee (the royalty) for the use of the third party trademarks. The Royalty Relief method involves estimating likely future sales, applying an appropriate royalty rate to them and then discounting estimated future, post-tax royalties, to arrive at a Net Present Value (NPV). This is held to represent the brand value.Best Global Brands  Brand Profiles & Valuations of the World‚Äôs Top Brands  Methodology  Brand Ratings In determining the appropriate royalty rate, Brand Finance establishes a range of comparable arm‚Äôs length royalty rates, and determines the point within the range that the brand under review falls by reference to a brand rating. The brand rating is calculated using Brand Finance's √ürand√üeta¬Æ analysis which benchmarks the strength, risk and potential of a brand, relative to its competitors, on a scale ranging from AAA to D. It is conceptually similar to a credit rating. The data used to calculate the ratings comes from various sources including Bloomberg, annual reports, client-commissioned research and Brand Finance internal research.'Brand USA' Value Plummets by $1.2 Trillion Since April 2011 According to Brand... - LONDON, August 31, 2011 /PRNewswire/ Brand Finance League Tables Each year Brand Finance produces a number of Brand League tables, segmented by region or sector.Tata now 41st most valuable brand in the world They launch many of these in conjunction with publications.

It is a natural stream originating in Clifton, New Jersey, passing through Passaic, New Jersey. For most of its length, it runs underground in a culvert constructed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Prior to the construction of the culvert, larger parts of it ran through a ground-level stream bed, though parts of it ran underground even in its natural configuration. The brook, throughout its length, is used as a catchment for storm drain by the cities of Clifton and Passaic. Parts of Clifton's combined storm/sewer lines run adjacent, and when they overflow or have breakages, feed additional stormwater or raw sewage into the brook. In the past, Clifton industry took advantage of the brook for wastewater dumping, mostly illegally. The brook runs through Passaic's Third Ward Veterans Memorial Park, constructed in the 1930s as part of the Works Project Administration (WPA). At the time of the park's construction, the brook's path was altered slightly, and a small lake bed was dug in the center of the park, creating a pond fed by the brook. The pond was open to fishing and boating until the detection of industrial pollution. Although not well known, the pond is officially named Hughes Lake. Presently, the park contains the only exposed portion of the brook. The culvert ends at the westernmost tip of the park, near the Broadway entrance, at the end of the playground. The brook then flows along the border of the playground, and then runs roughly parallel to The Circle, the road bordering the park, until it reaches Hughes Lake. At the opposite end of the lake is a man-made dam and waterfall, where the brook continues, running underground again briefly to cross Passaic Avenue. On the other side of the avenue, it runs next to the ballfield and tennis court, before being concealed again to cross Howard Avenue, Pennington Avenue, Benson Court, and the New Jersey Transit railroad trestle. It runs in the open through an undeveloped portion of the park between Pennington and High Street, ducks under High, and runs across the edge of the playground that is at the eastern terminus of the park. It then continues in another culvert for the remainder of its length, until it meets the Passaic River near the foot of Brook Avenue. The brook was originally known as Mineral Spring Brook, when a resort business was attempted near the current start of the exposed part of the brook. A surveyor incorrectly labeled it McDonald's Brook, and variations of that name became the common name, and now the official name. Mineral Spring Avenue runs perpendicular to the brook near the site of the former resort, and the name of the street may actually be a remnant of the original name and the resort that tried to put the brook to medicinal use. Bloomfield Avenue, parts of it now renamed Broadway, was originally built on February 1, 1803, to provide access to the spring resort. In addition to Hughes Lake, two other ponds were found along the brook's path downstream, after it crossed Main Avenue (known then as Franklin Avenue). The ponds have since been lost to development, and the entire stream is buried along this length. Both ponds were along Brook Ave, on its south side. The first was at Park Avenue (east side of Park), and the other was midway between Gold Street and River Road. Though Gold Street itself no longer exists at Brook, a portion of it remains at Terhune, and its old location can be determined via a straight line. In a late 20th-century rehabilitation of the park, the brook was rerouted again. Much of the new bed eroded to the sides.

The ASIC4 gene is one of the five paralogous genes that encode proteins that form trimeric acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) in mammals. The cDNA of this gene was first cloned in 2000. The ASIC genes have splicing variants that encode different proteins that are called isoforms. These genes are mainly expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system. ASICs can form both homotrimeric (meaning composed of three identical subunits) and heterotrimeric channels. Structure and function This gene encodes a member of the ASIC/ENaC superfamily of proteins. The members of this family are amiloride- sensitive sodium channels that contain intracellular N and C termini, 2 hydrophobic transmembrane (TM) regions, and a large extracellular loop, which has many cysteine residues with conserved spacing. The TM regions are generally symbolized as TM1 (clone to N-terminus) and TM2 (close to C-terminus). The pore of the channel through which ions selectively flow from the extracellular side into the cytoplasm is formed by the three TM2 regions of the trimer.

It was formed on 1 April 2012 by the merger of the former municipalities of Malvaglia, Semione and Ludiano.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 23 May 2012 History =Ludiano= In 1926 a grave was discovered which contained Iron Age grave offerings. The modern municipality of Ludiano is first mentioned in 1211 as Luguilano. It was mentioned as a local center for surrounding farmhouses and villages in 1351. The parish church of S. Secondo is first mentioned in 1293. It was rebuilt in 1779‚Äì82, though the older romanesque clock tower was retained. In the past, the main sources of income were crops, livestock and vineyards. This income was supplemented by money sent back to the village by emigrants to other European countries. After the emigration-related decline in the mid-19th century, the number of inhabitants has increased in the last decades of the 20th century and has led to numerous new homes. In 2000 about half the jobs in the village were in manufacturing and the services sector accounted for about a fifth of the jobs. Two-thirds of the working population earned their livelihood outside the community. =Malvaglia= Malvaglia is first mentioned in 1205 as de Malvallia. In German it used to be known as Manglia. Malvaglia's development and history is closely tied to the development and history of the Blenio valley. In the settlement of Rongier, an ancient town on the Lukmanier road, a Roman coin hoard was found. The settlement is also home to the Casa Baggio. Casa Baggio was built in the 16th century and expanded in the 17th. It was probably the ruling seat of the bailiff. The building is now listed as a historic building. Above the village is also the remains of Casa dei pagani, a cave castle from the 11th‚Äì13th Centuries. The original, parish church was dedicated to St. Benedict and first mentioned in 1207. The current building, with St. Martin as the patron saint is from 1602 to 1603, but the bell tower is from the 13th Century. The local economy was dominated by agriculture, animal husbandry, vineyards. The emigration in until the 19th century to Italy and in the 19th and 20th centuries to France, England, and America, led to a sharp population decline. Between 1933 and 1959, the first cable car in the Canton was in operation between Malvaglia and Ponterio in the Malvaglia Valley. In 1995 a new line was inaugurated on Mount Dagro. In the 1940s for the construction of the dam, a road was built into the Malvaglia Valley. The ring road around the village open in 1976. In 2000 about one-third and one-half of the workers were employed in manufacturing and the services sectors, respectively. More than half of employed persons worked outside of the municipality.

After war broke out between Britain and France in 1803 Hamilton was interned as an enemy alien, but was released to carry on his researches at the insistence of the French scholar Constantine Volney. Hamilton taught Sanskrit to Volney and others, including Friedrich Schlegel and Jean-Louis Burnouf, the father of Eugene Burnouf.

The 2011 Fenland District Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Fenland District Council in Cambridgeshire, England. The whole council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. Background In the 2007 election, the Conservatives won 39 of the 40 seats, with the only other seat being won by an independent. However, in April 2010 Liberal Democrat Dave Pratrick gained a seat at a by- election from the Conservatives in Kirkgate ward. A total of 96 candidates stood in the election for the 40 seats on the council. 2 Conservatives candidates were unopposed at the election, Martin Curtis in Kingsmoor and Pop Jolley in Wimblington, a substantial drop from the number at the 2007 election. For the other 38 seats the candidates were 38 Conservatives, 20 Labour, 19 Liberal Democrats, 10 independents, 4 United Kingdom Independence Party and 3 Green Party. The most candidates were in Waterlees ward in Wisbech, where 9 candidates stood for 2 seats on the council. Election result The Conservatives retained control of the council, but their majority was reduced slightly. They won 34 of the 40 seats on the council, after losing 4 seats, 3 to independents and 1 to the Liberal Democrats. The wins for the Conservatives included Will Sutton in Elm and Christchurch, where he defeated the former Conservative member of the cabinet Phil Webb, who been deselected before the election and stood as an independent. Conservative leader of the council Alan Melton, who comfortably held his own seat in Birch ward in Chatteris, said he was \\"ecstatic\\" at the results, which he said showed support for his party's policies. The Conservatives losses came in Waterlees, where independents Michael and Virginia Mucknor gained both seats from the Conservatives, and in March West where independent Rob Skoulding took one of the three seats. Meanwhile, Liberal Democrat Gavin Booth gained one of the two seats in Parson Drove and Wisbech St Mary from the Conservatives. After independent Mark Archer and Liberal Democrat Dave Pratrick held their seats, this meant the opposition on the council was 4 independent and 2 Liberal Democrat councillors.

The company serves organizations, governments, and militaries. In 2008 Arkel had about 300 employees and $85 million in annual sales. Foundation and expansion The company was founded in 1954, at first undertaking construction of chemical and refinery complexes in the Mississippi River valley. It then expanded into other parts of the United States, and then internationally. Although Arkel is diverse, Arkel International specializes in construction in challenging environments, building secure facilities with self-contained power supplies. Sugar refineries Arkel's first overseas project was a large sugar refinery in Sudan. The Kenana project was huge, involving a 40-megawatt power station, conduits, canals pumping stations, crushers and so on, and ended up costing $613 million. In 1974 it was awarded to Lonrho, but after cost overruns in 1977 the management contract was awarded to Arkel. Arkel won a government contract in Kenya for an overhaul and expansion of Nzoia Sugar Company in 1988. The project was troubled, with delays and cost overruns, and eventually a review committee recommended cancellation. Other contracts A joint venture with a Sudanese investor, Arkel-Talab Cargo Services, provided air transport in the Sudan in the 1980s. They had supported Chevron Corporation until that company withdrew from oil exploration in Sudan in 1984. They were being considered in 1986 as a contractor to the U.S. government to deliver emergency supplies. In March 1986 Arkel was awarded a contract worth almost $6 million by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to build facilities for the Sudan Air Force. With a civil war in progress in the south, it was difficult to get materials to the construction site, and the project ran into a series of delays. As Arkel was finishing the job they got involved in a legal dispute with a subcontractor. Two of Arkel's employees were then arrested, common practice in Sudan legal disputes, but later released. Arkel became a contractor to the U.S. Government in 2003. Projects in this role were to provide construction services in conflict, post-conflict and remote, underdeveloped regions of the world. The projects included integrated logistics and critical power solutions. In April 2006 Arkel won a contract from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for maintenance and deactivation of manufactured homes and travel trailers. The contract was worth up to $100 million. These units are for use in disaster relief situations such as the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. In 2009, the company was a member of the International Stability Operations Association, which supports the private military industry. In April 2010 the company won a $6.4 million contract to supply 16 pre-engineered buildings, with electrical power and force protection barriers, to Camp Leatherneck in Helmand Province, Afghanistan.

He succeeded his fellow Republican, Page Cortez of Lafayette, who instead became the District 23 state senator. With no previous political experience, Bishop was the only unopposed candidate for an open House seat in the Louisiana nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 22, 2011. Similarly, Cortez had no opponent in the Senate race to succeed the term-limited Michael J. Michot, another Lafayette businessman and a Democrat-turned Republican. A third Republican, former state Representative Ronnie Johns of Sulphur in Calcasieu Parish, also ran unopposed and succeeded the term-limited Willie Landry Mount in the District 27 seat in the state Senate. Background A native of Jeanerette in Iberia Parish, Bishop graduated from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge. In 1997, after leaving LSU, he moved to Lafayette. He is an officer of his family's business, Baldwin Redi-Mix Concrete. Bishop and his wife, the former Kim Dugas, have two sons, Donald and Cooper Bishop. Political life Even before it was clear that Bishop would run without opposition for the House seat, the candidate drew the endorsement of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Bishop also carried the support of the TEA Party movement, which endorsed his candidacy based on Bishop's stated belief in smaller government and the desire to reduce regulations that hamper business growth. Bishop declared that the state is moving in the right direction: \\"I believe that business is obviously the backbone of everything, and I'm going to be a pro-business politician by all means.\\" Bishop is a member of the Lafayette Education Foundation, the Concrete and Aggregate Association of Louisiana, the National Redi-Mix Concrete Association, and Downtown Lafayette Unlimited. Bishop's legislative ratings have ranged from 97 to 100 percent from LABI. In 2012, he was rated 100 percent by the National Federation of Independent Business. In 2013 and 2014, the conservative Louisiana Family Forum scored him 90 percent each year. He is rated 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2013 and 2014, the Louisiana Association of Educators rated him 0 percent for both years. In 2014, Bishop co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics; the bill was approved by the full House, 88-5. In 2014, he voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He voted to prohibit the transportation of dogs in the beds of pick-up trucks while traveling on interstate highways. He did not vote on the requirement that companies give notice when they engage in hydraulic fracking. He voted against the repeal of the anti-sodomy laws. He co-sponsored the establishment in 2013 of surrogacy contracts. He voted to reduce penalties for the possession of marijuana. He supported lifetime concealed carry gun permits and voted for concealed carry in restaurants that sell alcoholic beverages. He opposed making information about permit holders a matter of public record. Bishop in 2013 voted against an increase in judicial pay and opposed the removal of the mandatory retirement age for judges. In 2012, he voted to prohibit the use of telephones while driving. He supported tax incentives for attracting a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana and for individuals who contribute to scholarship funds. He voted to reduce the number of hours that polling locations remain open; Louisiana has traditionally had 14-hour polling days. He supported the requirement for drug testing of welfare recipients, which passed the House, 65 to 26.

Daniels returned to active duty in the United States Navy on December 12, 2011, and is believed to be one of the first servicemembers, and perhaps the first, to return to active duty following the end of restrictions on service by openly gay and lesbian servicemembers in the U.S. Armed Forces. Early life Daniels grew up in Wallingford, Pennsylvania, where he spent his childhood in and out of foster care and between the custody of his parents John and Theresa who divorced when he was five years old. Despite his rough upbringing, he excelled in arts and sciences at Strath Haven Middle School and won an award for excellence in volunteerism and community service from the Rotary Club. Daniels graduated from Chichester High School in Boothwyn, Pennsylvania, in 2000. This article refers to Jase Daniels as Jason Knight. Military career Daniels enlisted in the United States Navy on April 4, 2001. He served his first two years in the Navy Ceremonial Guard where he was one of the first group to qualify for the Navy Ceremonial Guard Ribbon. Daniels then studied Hebrew at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, graduating in December 2004. Daniels was then transferred to Fort Gordon, Georgia, and served as a Hebrew linguist. There he outed himself in marriage annulment paperwork he submitted to his command and the Navy initiated discharge proceedings under DADT. His discharge records, because of a clerical error, failed to note that his homosexuality was the basis for his discharge and his status became active reservist, which made him eligible for recall. Daniels was recalled to active duty June 2006 because the military needed his language skills. He later said: \\"I wanted to go back so bad, I was jumping up and down. The military was my life.\\" He served a year in Kuwait with the Navy Customs Battalion Romeo. Daniels has said that during this deployment he served openly without issue. In May 2007, he was profiled by Stars and Stripes in a cover story that chronicled his life serving in the Armed Forces as an openly gay man. He was discharged again under DADT when his tour ended later that year. He campaigned publicly for an end to DADT and told Newsweek he thought returning to service would go smoothly: \\"People like me can be integrated back as well as any other person. I‚Äôll be the first to the recruiting office when DADT is repealed.\\" As the DADT policy was nearing its end in September 2011, he told the New York Times he wanted to resume his Navy career, learn Persian, and become an officer. He joined a lawsuit that attempted to require reinstatement of those discharged under DADT at their former rank, though it was thought to have little success given the reshaping of the U.S. military in these years. He said that since leaving the Navy \\"I've had no direction in my life.\\" He expressed confidence that his sexual orientation would not be an issue. Daniels was reinstated in the United States Navy on December 12, 2011. After taking his oath he told reporters: Daniels transferred back to the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, California, for a Persian course in early January 2012. Daniels was active as a Command Public Affairs Specialist while stationed at Navy Information Operations Command Georgia (NIOC GA), located in Augusta, GA. He participated in and reported on the inaugural LGBT pride month event that was held on Fort Gordon. He also highlighted Navy Information Operation Command Georgia's robust physical fitness program and the teams aspirations to live up to the Department of Defense Operation Healthy Base Initiative, as well as the support from the command's Family Readiness Group who support families of deployed sailors.

He was the Boss of the Philadelphia crime family from 1995 until 1999, when he became the first American Mafia boss to turn state's evidence. Natale helped sentence Joey Merlino to a 14 year sentence in 2001, but in January 2005, was also sentenced for racketeering, receiving a 13 year sentence. He was released in May 2011 and entered the witness protection program. Early life Natale was born on March 6, 1935, in South Philadelphia to Italian American parents; he had one younger brother. Natale's grandparents were Italian immigrants, and his paternal grandparents died in the 1918 flu pandemic in Philadelphia. Michael, Natale's father was an associate of the Philadelphia crime family and operated a numbers operation for them. His relationship with his father was very poor; he had once repeatedly kicked him because Natale missed his curfew. Natale was mentored by hitman Felix \\"Skinny Razor\\" DiTullio. Natale ran the Bartenders Union Local 170, running it on behalf of Angelo Bruno. One of the three former 170 union leaders, Joseph McGreal, demanded that Natale be removed as the union leader; McGreal was subsequently murdered in 1973, with Andrew Thomas DelGiorno believed to be the killer. According to Natale, he became a made man in a secret ceremony with Bruno and Carlo Gambino in Manhattan. In 1970, Natale murdered conman George Feeney after he insulted Natale and Bruno. He was also known for assisting the Philadelphia mob in taking over casinos in Atlantic City during the late 1970s. Criminal career In 1979, Natale was convicted of arson for firebombing a furniture store in an insurance fraud scheme; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. The following year, he was convicted of participating in a drug deal involving 500,000 quaaludes and 10 kilos of cocaine; he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. It was during his prison sentence that he met Joey Merlino and the two allegedly conspired to take over the Philadelphia crime family from John Stanfa.Caparella, Kitty. \\"Recalling A Bloody Hit.\\" Philadelphia Daily News. April 24, 2001.Anastasia, George. \\"Mob Boss Natale Tells of 'Descent Into Hell'.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer. March 31, 2001. In 1990, he conspired and ordered the murder of bookmaker Louis \\"Louie Irish\\" DeLuca. James \\"Jimmy Brooms\\" DiAddorio was shot 6 times and murdered whilst he was talking on the phone 4 months later; his murder also directly ordered by Natale. Stanfa was arrested for Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act violations in March 1994, was convicted in 1995, and sentenced to life in 1996. With most of Stanfa's supporters also arrested and convicted, Merlino, released from prison in November 1994, named Natale, who was released from prison on parole, as the new boss while positioning himself as his underboss. During Natale's reign, Merlino was the real power in the family, allowing Natale to become boss to direct law enforcement attention away from himself. On October 5, 1995, when John Veasey, Philly mafia hitman-turned government witness, was set to testify against John Stanfa and his men, his brother William Veasey was murdered. A year later, Natale had North Jersey capo Joseph Sodano murdered because he refused to attend two separate meetings. His last confirmed involvement in murder was with 61-year old Anthony Turra in March 1998, who was found shot to death in front of his home before he could arrive to trial for plotting to murder Merlino. =Informant= In June 1998, Natale was jailed for a parole violation; Merlino subsequently took control of the family and cut off support to the imprisoned boss. Angered by this, Natale offered to secretly record conversations with Merlino,Anastasia (2004), p. 337 but it was not until September 1999, when he was indicted for financing drug deals, that he formally struck a deal to cooperate.Anastasia (2004), p. 263 In doing so, Natale became the first sitting boss in the history of the American Mafia to become government informant. Natale testified against Merlino during his 2001 racketeering trial, but was unable to secure a conviction for the murders he claimed Merlino committed. On December 3, 2001, Merlino was however convicted of racketeering charges and given a 14-year prison sentence. Natale had admitted to committing eight murders and four attempted murders. In January 2005, Natale was sentenced to 13 years in prison for drug dealing, racketeering and bribery. He was released in May 2011, and placed in witness protection. Later life Natale has five children with his wife Lucy Natale; 3 daughters and 2 sons. He has another daughter with a previous girlfriend, she has disowned her father. Natale has a brother who was a music conductor as of 2001 at a casino based in Atlantic City. In March 2017, Natale published a book named Last Don Standing: The Secret Life of Mob Boss Ralph Natale, alongside Larry McShane and Dan Pearson. In late 2016, it was announced that actor Frank Grillo would play as Natale in an upcoming feature film.

It focuses on preserving the heritage of the Kennebunks through its collections, preservation, interpretation, and exhibition of its material culture. As a history and art center in Southern Maine, the Museum's collections include objects ranging from 19th-century paintings to shipbuilding tools, from 18th-century clothing to contemporary art. It is located in the heart of the Kennebunk Historic District, occupying 18,000 square feet of space in several buildings on Main Street. The Brick Store Museum's buildings comprise the oldest commercial block in Kennebunk, with structures dating from 1810 to 1860. Prior to becoming part of the museum, these buildings housed the town's first library, a telegraph office, a furniture store, a grocery store, Water District offices, an auto supply store, apartments, a general store, and a fraternal lodge. History In 1825, wealthy merchant and shipowner William Lord (1799-1873) constructed a general store out of bricks. There were few such structures in Kennebunk, therefore it was nicknamed ‚ÄúLord‚Äôs Brick Store.‚Äù The nine-foot windlass used for conveying goods between floors can still be seen through the museum's second-floor ceiling. In 1936, William Lord's great-granddaughter, Edith Cleaves Barry (1884-1969), inherited the Brick Store building and established the Brick Store Museum in the space. It remains to be one of a few American museums opened between the Great Depression and World War II. Immediately to the right of the Brick Store is a building constructed in 1810 by Enoch Hardy, a local tobacconist. He maintained his own shop on the second floor, and the first floor was used as a grocery store. Kennebunk's post office and telegraph office were once in this building as well. The Kennebunk Free Library Association also used the space as a library. The next building on the block was built at the corner of Water and Main Streets by Samuel Clark in 1860. It was later moved to its current location, to the right of the Hardy building, in 1870. It operated as a butcher shop and restaurant until 1906, when it became an auto supply store. The corner structure, currently painted a salmon color, was built in 1814 by Moses Savary. It was originally painted white, and because most buildings in Kennebunk were then yellow, this building became known as \\"the white store.\\" The building was used almost continuously as a market until becoming part of the museum. Its last occupant was an antique shop. The three buildings on the block were purchased by Barry as they became available, the last in 1958; eventually, all four structures were connected on the interiors to form one cohesive block. The fifth building in the museum complex was given by the Barry family, originally as the New Art Center Workshop, run by Edith Barry. The house at 4 Dane Street (located behind the museum), was built in the 19th century and inherited by Edith Barry through her mother's family. It is currently used by the museum as a programming space and collections storage facility, as well as rental office space. Collections The museum's collections represent various aspects of the region's history from its earliest settlements to the present day. The majority of the 35,000-piece object collections speaks to socio-cultural, economic, and geo-political themes from the early 19th to the 21st centuries, with a few standout examples from the late 17th and mid 18th centuries. The decorative and fine arts collections include examples by some of northern New England's finest artists (e.g. Thomas Badger, John Brewster, Jr., Abbott Fuller Graves, William Hackett, Louis D. Norton, and Hannah Brown Skeele). Regionally significant textiles, clothing, household goods, and maritime artifacts are distinguishing features of the permanent collections. Additional highlights are the collections pertaining to renowned Maine-based authors Sarah Orne Jewett, Kenneth Roberts, and Booth Tarkington. The museum's particularly strong archival collection totals approximately 25,000 pieces. Letters, ledgers, corporate records, photographs, glass plate negatives, postcards, charts, architectural plans, maps, and genealogical material are made available to researchers and are used in exhibitions. Programs and exhibitions An array of programs offered by the museum reaches out to all ages in the New England community. Craft workshops, lecture series, member- only events, and children's summer and February vacation camps continuously appear on the Museum's yearly event schedule. Special events such as the Museum's 75th Anniversary celebration in 2011, the annual ‚ÄúAll Souls Walk and Dinner‚Äù celebrating Halloween, and a year-end Holiday Tea at a chosen historic home in Kennebunk are produced by the staff and volunteers of the Museum. The museum's online presence consists of two Twitter feeds, following the travels of founder Edith Barry, a yearly digital photography contest, and multiple online exhibits featured on the museum web site. Renovation The museum underwent comprehensive structural renovations to its four, 19th-century Main Street buildings in 2008-2009, as the result of a capital campaign. The museum remained open to the public throughout, but sections were temporarily offline as construction progressed. All collections stored in the complex were packed and moved within the facility. The renovations were completed in the summer of 2009.

Balboa Books. As a composer and arranger he has become well known for large ensemble jazz music set to contemporary fusion and rock music of groups such as Chicago, Blood, Sweat and Tears, and the Yellowjackets. Most notably he arranged the music for and produced the award-winning and critically acclaimed CD, Bob Curnow's L.A. Big Band Plays The Music of Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays.Review (2000). The Music of Pat Metheny. Jazz Journal International, vol. 53, page 31.Review (1995). The Music of Pat Metheny. CD Review Magazine, vol. 11, Volume 11, Issue 10, page 13. His compositions and arrangements are heavily influenced by earlier writers for the Stan Kenton Orchestra such as Pete Rugolo, Bill Russo, Johnny Richards and Bill Holman.Steven Harris. The Kenton Kronicles Dynaflow Publications. 2000. pp. 266-268 Curnow is currently owner and President of Sierra Music Publications, Inc., he is also prominent in the instrumental music and jazz education fields. Early life, musical education and influences Bob Curnow was born and grew up in Easton, Pennsylvania and was first exposed to music through learning the trumpet at age 9 but then switched to baritone horn. He ultimately started to play the trombone at age 12. Curnow had started high school when he first heard the Stan Kenton Orchestra with Kai Winding on the 45 single Collaboration. In addition to learning the trombone Curnow was doing a great deal of transcribing big band music and eventually of the Kenton band composers.NOTE from author: this is an essential part of learning the technique of composing and orchestration. During college he first met Stan Kenton in person in 1961 during the Stan Kenton Band Clinics. Curnow worked his way through college playing the string bass, he graduated from West Chester University of Pennsylvania in May 1963. Professional career =with Stan Kenton= On May 19 of 1963 (1 day after college graduation) Bob Curnow started as a trombonist with the Stan Kenton Orchestra at the age of 21 touring all of the United States and the UK through the end of November; this was the last of Kenton's Mellophonium Bands and the group disbanded after this tour until 1965.William F. Lee, Audree Coke Kenton (1980). Stan Kenton: Artistry In Rhythm. Creative Press of Los Angeles. During this tour Curnow had arranged \\"God Save The Queen\\" for the orchestra; this would be his entry into the cadre of Kenton composers and arrangers. He recorded in the trombone section of the Kenton Orchestra for Capitol Records on the LP's Artistry In Voices And Brass and From The Creative World Of Stan Kenton Comes Jean Turner. Most notably he sat next to and established a friendship with trombonist Jiggs Whigham during their time on the Kenton band together. =Back to school and teaching= After leaving the Stan Kenton Orchestra he did graduate work at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan from 1964 through 1967 earning two master's degrees and completing his doctoral course work. He served as Professor of Instrumental Music and director of the Jazz Lab bands at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio from 1967 through 1973.Billboard Magazine, Jazz Labs in Cleveland start Jan 16, 1971, Page 28. =As producer for Stan Kenton= United-Western Studios, Los Angeles National Anthems of the World sessions By 1971 Curnow was contacted again by Stan Kenton to do the arrangements for a new concept, double LP, National Anthems Of The World. Kenton remembered the earlier arrangement done in 1963 of \\"God Save The Queen\\", this sparked the interest of Kenton and led to Curnow serving as chief arranger, conductor, and the producer for the new 1972 concept album. Though the recordings ended up being a commercial failure for the Stan Kenton Orchestra, the project became a high point for Curnow as an arranger and record producer. After the National Anthems project Curnow stepped in on numerous dates for an ailing Kenton to conduct during that next year. In June 1973, at the age of 31, Curnow was hired as the Director of Artists & Repertoire; by August Kenton fired the general manager and Curnow was in charge of the complete Creative World operations.Billboard Magazine, Robert H. Curnow named to Creative World Aug 11, 1973, Page 4. Starting with the LP 7.5 On The Richter Scale, Curnow was the producer for 6 of the final 7 Stan Kenton studio albums for Creative World leading up to Kenton's death in August 1979. He also oversaw the re-issue of numerous LPs from Kenton's Capitol Records catalogue. During this tenure with Kenton he was in charge as composer, arranger, and producer of one of the last commercial successes the band was to have with Stan Kenton plays Chicago.Review: High fidelity Musical America, Volume 25, Issue 1, page 34.

Universal Studios, Chicago June 1974 Stan Kenton plays Chicago sessions During this period as a younger composer, arranger and producer, Curnow was able to help usher in a new, more vital concept and style for the orchestra which helped appeal to a younger music audience of the post big band/rock n' roll era.Sparke, Michael (2010). \\"Stan Kenton: This Is An Orchestra\\". University of North Texas Press. p. 260 . Due to deteriorating business conditions with the Stan Kenton Orchestra and Creative World Records, Curnow resigned from his post in 1976. Curnow is quoted as to the frustration he encountered, \\"I was burnt out...I really didn't like the record business...it's a dirty game working with the big players and all the crap that goes on there\\". Kenton's 1977 album Journey To Capricorn would be the last studio-produced project for the orchestra and the final LP for which Curnow served as producer for Creative World.Billboard Magazine, review (Dave Dexter Jr.), Stan Kenton Journey To Capricorn, page 83. =CSULA and the McDonald's All-American High School Band= In 1976 Curnow accepted the position as Director of Jazz Studies at California State University, Los Angeles; he held that position until 1987. He conducted the award-winning No. 1 Jazz Ensemble,Dave Dexter Jr., Billboard Magazine, Kenton Memorial Concert at Cal. St. L.A. Dec 6, 1980 the Brass Ensemble, Symphonic Band and the Wind Ensemble. For eight years (1981‚Äì1989) Curnow also directed the McDonald's All-American High School Jazz Band, touring the country and discovering many talented young jazz players. =Pat Metheny's music and Sierra Publishing= Curnow ultimately penned some twelve arrangements of compositions by Pat Metheny and/or Lyle Mays; the initial arrangement of Metheny's The First Circle was tested out and recorded on a critically acclaimed school jazz LP at California State University, Los Angeles.We're Back!

Big Band Plays the Music of Pat Metheny and Lyle Mays have been called a prime example of the art of arranging for large jazz ensemble in a contemporary setting.Bob Rusch, reviewer: Cadence Magazine, Volume 21, Issue 3, page 91 (1995) A second CD was released in 2011 entitled The Music of Pat Metheny & Lyle Mays, Volume II by the Bob Curnow Big Band. Since 1976 Curnow has been the C.E.O. of Sierra Music Publications, Inc. and currently resides in Liberty Lake, Washington. The company is the exclusive publisher of music from the Stan Kenton Orchestra library as well as many other important and historic large jazz ensemble scores. The company is currently overseeing the production of large ensemble music of the rock/pop group Radiohead. In 2005, Curnow was given the Distinguished Music Alumnus Award by the West Chester University of Pennsylvania School of Music. Curnow has donated almost $60,000 worth of musical compositions, CDs and books to the School of Music Jazz Studies Area. West Chester University of Pennsylvania, The Presser Music Library Jazz education and former students Bob Curnow conducting in PA, 2010Curnow is a strong advocate of Jazz education and has been very involved since being a part of the well known Stan Kenton Band Clinics when first associated with the group in 1963.Billboard Magazine, Stan Kenton Slates Clinics on Campus Mar 10, 1973, Page 25. As well as holding academic positions at universities, he has served as a guest conductor and educational clinician for groups and organizations throughout the United States and Canada.

In some situations, especially in the context of quantum mechanics product numerical range is known as local numerical range  Introduction  Let X be an operator acting on an N-dimensional Hilbert space \\\\mathcal{H}_N. Let \\\\mathrm{\\\\Lambda}(X) denote its numerical range, i.e. the set of all \\\\lambda such that there exists a normalized state { \\\\psi \\\\rangle}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_N,  \\\\psi  = 1, which satisfies {\\\\langle \\\\psi } X { \\\\psi \\\\rangle} = \\\\lambda. An analogous notion can be defined for operators acting on a composite Hilbert space with a tensor product structure. Consider first a bi-partite Hilbert space, \\\\mathcal{H}_N = \\\\mathcal{H}_K \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{H}_M , of a composite dimension N=KM. Let X be an operator acting on the composite Hilbert space. We define the product numerical range \\\\mathrm{\\\\Lambda}^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\otimes}\\\\\\\\! \\\\left( X \\\\right) of X, with respect to the tensor product structure of \\\\mathcal{H}_N, as \\\\mathrm{\\\\Lambda}^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\otimes}\\\\\\\\! \\\\left( X \\\\right) = \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ {\\\\langle \\\\psi_A \\\\otimes \\\\psi_B } X { \\\\psi_A\\\\otimes\\\\psi_B \\\\rangle} : { \\\\psi_A \\\\rangle}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_K, { \\\\psi_B \\\\rangle}\\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_M \\\\right\\\\\\\\}, where { \\\\psi_A \\\\rangle} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_K and { \\\\psi_B \\\\rangle} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{H}_M are normalized.  Product numerical radius  Let \\\\mathcal{H}_N = \\\\mathcal{H}_K \\\\otimes \\\\mathcal{H}_M be a tensor product Hilbert space. We define the product numerical radius r^{\\\\otimes}(X) of X, with respect to this tensor product structure, as r^{\\\\otimes}(X) = \\\\max\\\\\\\\{z:z\\\\in\\\\mathrm{\\\\Lambda}^{\\\\\\\\!\\\\otimes}\\\\\\\\! \\\\left( X \\\\right)\\\\\\\\}.  Notation  The notion of numerical range of a given operator, also called \\"field of values\\", has been extensively studied during the last few decades and its usefulness in quantum theory has been emphasized. Several generalizations of numerical range are known. In particular, Marcus introduced the notion of ‚Äô‚Äô‚Äôdecomposable numerical range‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô, the properties of which are a subject of considerable interest. The product numerical range can be considered as a particular case of the decomposable numerical range defined for operators acting on a tensor product Hilbert space. This notion may also be considered as a numerical range relative to the proper subgroup U(K)\\\\times U(M) of the full unitary group U(KM).  Properties of product numerical range   General case  It is not difficult to establish the basic properties of the product numerical range which are independent of the partition of the Hilbert space and of the structure of the operator. We list them below leaving some simple items without a proof. = Basic properties = Topological facts concerning product numerical range for general operators. # Product numerical range forms a connected set in the complex plane. This is true because product numerical range is a continuous image of a connected set. # Product numerical range is subadditive.

Consider the following simple example. Let :A= \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\otimes \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 0 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\+ i \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right) \\\\otimes \\\\left( \\\\begin{array}{cc} 0 & 0\\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 \\\\end{array} \\\\right).

Product numerical range of matrix A is presented below. The comparison of the numerical range (gray triangle) and the product numerical range (dashed set) for matrix A. Product numerical range forms a nonempty set for a general operator. In particular it contains the barycenter of the spectrum.

Biography and Education  Stephen Leeb is a financial author, wealth manager, and publisher of a family of investment newsletters. He is a recurring guest on CNN, Fox News, [NPR] and Bloomberg TV, and has been called one of the country's foremost financial experts with Charlie Gasparino in 2016 recommending Leeb as a good candidate for Federal Reserve Chairmen. Leeb earned a B.S. in Economics from the Wharton School of Business, and a Masters in Mathematics and a Ph.D in Psychology from the University of Illinois. He authored research papers on psychology and statistics in the peer-reviewed journal Psychological Reports. His graduate degrees were obtained in three years. Stephen Leeb is married and lives in New York City, New York.  Career  Leeb has written eight books on macroeconomic trends, finance and investment, including the New York Times business bestseller The Coming Economic Collapse: How You Can Thrive When Oil Costs $200 a Barrel.New York Times, 2007 Leeb's earlier book Defying the Market, which predicted the dot.com bubble's collapse, was named one of the best business books of 1999 by the Library Journal. His most recent book, titled Red Alert, has been called ‚Äúa much needed shot in the arm for American complacency‚Äù by Publishers Weekly. Red Alert was awarded the 2012 Axiom Business Book Awards silver medal in the International Business/Globalization category. Leeb is Head of the Advisory Board of Leor Exploration & Production LLC (since 2006) and a member of the advisory boards of Electrum USA Ltd. (since 2007) and Sunshine Silver Mines. Both companies explore for natural resources, especially precious metals and energy. In 2007 Leor sold assets to Canadian-based Encana Cp. for over $2.5 billion. He is also a member of the board and managing director of the PlainSight Group, an innovation company centered at Yale University. Leeb currently heads the Leeb Group, a publisher of investment newsletters and services including The Complete Investor (general investing); Leeb‚Äôs Real World Investing (commodities); and The Cash Cow (exchange-traded funds or ETFs). The Complete Investor was named the best financial/investing newsletter by the Software and Information Industry Association in the 2013 SIPAwards Competition.

In Defying the Market, published in 1999, he also predicted the inadequacy of computers for solving the major challenges of the subsequent decade, in particular resource scarcity. In The Coming Economic Collapse, published in 2006, Leeb wrote that a decline in nominal home prices would be ‚Äúthe vicious circle to end all vicious circles‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..It would be a far greater challenge than rescuing the economy in the wake of the tech bubble... It would take massive amounts of money. Interest rates would likely fall to zero. Government spending would need to reach unimaginably high levels.‚ÄùThe Coming Economic Collapse, by Stephen Leeb and Glen Strathy, copyright 2006. Because of the potential consequences Leeb argued the Fed would prefer inflation rather than trying to cool an economy already stung by deflationary effects of high oil. In his subsequent book Red Alert, Leeb acknowledged he had been wrong to assume that the Federal Reserve \\"had the situation under control\\" and would \\"do whatever it took to assure that prices remained on an even keel.\\"The Coming Economic Collapse, by Stephen Leeb with Gregory Dorsey, copyright 2011.

Leeb is bullish on the price of gold.

Flippomusic live at the College of Lake County, 1994 Flippomusic live at the Jazz Bulls, Chicago 1996 Flippomusic in an earlier incarnation - The Bop Shop, 1999 Flippomusic at the Jazz Buffet, Chicago, 1999 Flippomusic at Borders, 2000  History  = 1992-1994 - Tendrils of Light = Flippomusic gave its first performance at At The Tracks in Chicago and continued performing at area clubs, including the Bop Shop, Jazz Bulls, the Hothouse, Morseland, the Underground Wonderbar, and the Heartland Cafe. The original members of the band included Dave Flippo (keyboards), Dan Hesler (saxophone), Steve Hashimoto (electric bass), Steve Strunk (drums) and John McLean (guitar).The instrumentation was reconfigured in 1993 and the guitar position was replaced by Hamid Drake on percussion with Aras Biskis taking over the drum chair. The band recorded its first CD, Tendril of Light, on the Southport label in 1994 and also won first place in Winterbreak-Cruise to Chicago contest, a City of Chicago-sponsored event which won them a booking at the Taste of Chicago in the same year. Guest artists on Tendrils of Light include Michael Zerang and Ken Gueno on percussion and Donn De Santo on bass. =1994-2001 - Ganesh = The band added additional Flippo compositions as well as works by Steve Hashimoto, Dan Hesler and several modern jazz standards to their repertoire and began performing at area colleges, festivals and special events at area museums and art galleries. During the period the instrumentation crystallized into its present form - with Dave Flippo on keys, Dan Hesler on saxes and flute, Donn De Santo on bass, Heath Chappell on drums and Aras Biskis now on percussion. The ensemble released their second CD, Ganesh, in 2001, also on Southport Records. The ensemble tracks were recorded at Donn DeSanto's \\"Bassplace Productions\\" studio while the solo piano preludes recorded at Sparrow Sound Design (Southport Records). Guest artists on the recording included Lyon Leifer on bansuri and Yatindra Vaid on tablas. =2001-2005 - When the Heart is Strong the Voice Rings True = Shortly after the release of Ganesh, De Santo and Flippo formed a duo and began mixing in new vocal compositions and arrangements of Flippo with jazz standards. For a time it was called Da Duo De Flippo De Santo, but later was considered part of Flippomusic. The larger quintet continued to perform during this period. The band's third release came in 2005 with a primarily duo recording, When the Heart is Strong, the Voice Rings True. The duo was augmented on several tracks by Dan Hesler on saxophones, Leo Murphy on drums and Michael Levin on clarinet. =2005 to present - Tao Tunes = During the recording of When the Heart is Strong ..., Flippo completed the Writer's Workshop Program at the Theatre Building Chicago where he composed two full length musicals and studied techniques for setting lyrics to music. Once he complete this course, he resurrected a project he has begun in 2004, the creation of a set of modern vocal jazz pieces that set various chapters of the Tao Te Ching ‚Äì Tao Tunes. After first creating adapted lyrics from various English translations in the public domain, Flippo composed eighteen pieces and completed the set in 2009. Recording began in March 2010, Tao Tunes was completed in June, 2011 and released November 2011. Guest artists include Larry Gray (cello), Neal Alger (guitar), Hamid Drake (percussion), Mike Levin (Bb and bass clarinet and flute) and Katherine Hughes (violin). After the recording of Tao Tunes, Flippomusic expanded its program to include music from all four CD's‚Äîthe \\"globaljazz\\" compositions, the vocal duo pieces and the set of Tao Tunes.

I Sait. \\"The Living Legend\\" .Islamic Encyclopedia (Malayalam), volume 2. Islamic Publishing House.\\"Wise Old man of Minicoy\\". Indian Express, 23 September 1998. Life Ali Manikfan was born to Musa Manikfan and Fatima Manika in Minicoy Island of Lakshadweep on 16 March 1938. His father Musa sent him to Kannur for formal education. As he was not interested in formal education, he left his studies and returned to his home land. According to him formal education is artificial and pointless and best way to acquire knowledge is getting wisdom by observing our environment. Ali Manikfan knows a great number of languages. Besides his mother tongue Divehi (Mahl), he learned English, Hindi and Malayalam, Arabic, Latin, French, Russian, German, Sinhalese, Persian, Sanskrit, Tamil and Urdu. His other areas of interest are marine biology, marine research, geography, astronomy, social science, traditional shipbuilding, education, fisheries, agriculture and horticulture. In 1956 he worked as a teacher and then became a clerk in Minicoy. (Indian government's chief civil official on the Island). But his interest was in marine life. In the 1960s he joined the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute of India. =New fish species discovered= While working with the marine biologist Dr. Santhappan Jones, Manikfan discovered a new fish species. Jones, impressed by Ali's observation skills and his wide knowledge about marine life, called the species Abudefduf manikfani.Xavier Romero-Frias. \\"Ali Manikfan - the man from Minicoy who loves nature\\".

Later, his knowledge was used for a paper describing the fish species in the Laccadive archipelago found in the specimen collections, on which he was listed as a co-author.. =Technical and agricultural experiments= Ali Manikfan follows non-aggressive agricultural methods that take nature in consideration. For his land in Valliyur in Thirunelveli district, Tamil Nadu, he produces his own electricity from a windmill which he designed himself. He built a house there with eco friendly materials that are naturally available in the region. Shipbuilder In 1981 Ali Manikfan was given the responsibility of making a reconstruction of an ancient Arab trading ship, the Sohar, by Irish adventurer Tim Severin. He went to Oman to direct the team of carpenters. The ship, named after the city of Sohar in Oman, was completely hand-made, using traditional boat-building techniques, and no metal was used in its construction. It took one year to build the 27-metre-long ship, and four tons of coir were needed to sew the planks of its hull, in the same way that ancient Maldivians had built ships. Tim Severin traveled 9,600 km from Oman to China by this ship. Severin described his eight-month-long journey in a book, The Sindbad Voyage. The book won the 1982 Thomas Cook Travel Book Award. The Sohar is now displayed at a Museum in Oman. Calendar Ali Manikfan has designed a lunar calendar based on the new moon times publishedhttp://astropixels.com/ephemeris/phasescat/phases2001.html by Fred Espenak who calculated the new moon times based on Astronomical Algorithms of Jean Meeus. He recommended Muslims all over the world to follow his lunar calendar.Islam online The Islamic calendar (Hijri calendar) is a purely lunar calendar. It contains 12 months that are based on the visible new moon of every month, and because 12 synodic months is only 12 x 29.53059=354.3671 days, the Islamic calendar is consistently shorter than a tropical year, and therefore it shifts with respect to the Christian calendar. The calendar is based on the Qur'an (Sura IX, 36-37) and its proper observance is a sacred duty for Muslims. Some Muslim astronomers like Khalid Shaukat of moonsighting.comhttp://www.moonsighting.com have suggested that lunar date lines should be marked on the world map for the Muslims to begin their fasting and celebrating their Eid. According to them this would depend on the visibility curve of the crescent and the date would begin from then. The so- called curved lunar date lines always keep on changing and they pass through cities, towns and even houses. According to Ali Manikfan's criterion \\"If the new moon ie. the geocentric conjunction of the sun and moon occurs before 00:00 UT, the following calendrical day is the first day of lunar month\\". For e.g. New moon of February 2015 occurred on 18th at 23:47UT. So the month of Jumada I of 1436 started from the next calendrical day 19 February, which was 13mins passed new moon. Likewise, New moon of the month of October in the same year happened on 13th at 00:05, So the month of Muharram of the year 1437 started on the next calendrical day 14 October, which was 23hrs 55mins passed new moon. As per Islamic law, the month should be begun after the sighting of Hilal. It will take 20 to 24hrs for Hilal to form. But in his lunar calendar some months start after a few minutes of conjunction and some other months after 23.9hrs of conjunction, which is almost a day. There is no relevance to Hilal in his calendar. He further claims \\"There is a day called universal day and conjunction always happens on that day\\". There is no day called universal day on the planet. No astronomer ever mentioned such a day. And he teaches that last day of the month should be the universal day of conjunction. He considers the 24hrs of UT in which conjunction happens as a universal day, which is the local day at Greenwich. The universal day what he claims is nothing but the local day of Greenwich. His criterion has no logic of except Greenwich midnight. It simply follows the day convention of the Christian calendar and the new moon time referred in Greenwich Mean Time. Since there is no Hilal involved in his criterion it is widely criticized by the Muslim scholars and astronomers in India. His calendar is followed by a minority in the State of Tamil Nadu in India, Where He is the Chairman of the Hijra Committee of India The criterion of the calendar proposed by Ali is not his own. It was an old criterion used in Saudi Arabia for its Ummul Qura calendar. Saudi dropped the criterion in 1999 and developed a new criterion. Nine years later when the world forgot about the old Ummul qura criterion, Ali took the scrapped calendar and claimed that he invented a new calendar for the mankind. He preached this in Kerala and later moved to the state of Tamil Nadu to preach the same. Bicycle He built a roller-driven motorcycle out of a bicycle with an attached old power sprayer motor. It was started by pedaling until the motor got going. He went with his son Musa from Tamil Nadu to New Delhi, doing an average of 60 to 70 km a day. Though its maximum speed is only 35 km/h, Ali Manikfan claims it's far cheaper and efficient than a petrol- driven two-wheeler. Direction of Qiblah He claims that \\"one who crosses the International Date Line should change his Qiblah in the opposite direction\\". So that people eastward should face east for Qiblah and people westward should face west for Qiblah. Moreover, he insists people on the either sides of the International Date Line to stand backwards to each other and face Qiblah at the opposite directions during prayer. In a globe, if concentric circles are made around a point, just like the around Ka‚Äôba, the concentric circles enlarge towards the half of the globe and then dwindle towards the antipode of the earlier point.

The party's ambition was to reform the colony's system from within through a series of gradual improvements for workers. However, economic problems caused by the Great Depression made progress difficult. The Butler Party was established by the more radical Tubal Uriah Butler, and took over from the TLP as the main voice of the islands' workers. The Butler Party supported strikes and riots in the 1930s, whilst the Labour Party opposed them. In the 1946 general elections, the first held under universal suffrage, the Labour Party received just 1.1% of the vote and failed to win a seat.Nohlen, pp639-642 In the 1950 elections its vote share rose to 7.9% and it won two seats. For the 1956 elections it ran as the Trinidad Labour Party-National Development Party and retained both seats. In 1957 it merged into the Democratic Labour Party.

The program was designed to foster the exchange of ideas and collaboration among engineers, neuroscientists, and theoreticians.  History  In the early 1980s, having laid out the foundations of VLSI,C. Mead and L. Conway, Introduction to VLSI systems. Addison-Wesley Reading Mass. (1980) Carver Mead became interested in exploring the similarities between computation done in the brain and the type of computations that could be carried out in analog silicon electronic circuits. Mead joined with John Hopfield, who was studying the theoretical foundations of neural computation,Hopfield, J.J. Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities. Proc. NatL Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 79, pp. 2554-2558, April 1982 to expand his study. Mead and Hopfield's first joint course in this area was entitled ‚ÄúPhysics of Computation‚Äù; Hopfield teaching about his work in neural networks and Mead about his work in the area of replicating neuronal structures in highly integrated electronic circuits.Shirley K. Cohen, Interview with Carver Mead. Archives of the California Institute of Technology. (PDF) Given the interest among both students and faculty, they decided to expand upon these themes in the following year. Richard Feynman joined them and three separate courses resulted: Hopfield's on neural networks, Mead's on neuromorphic analog circuits,C. Mead, Analog VLSI and neural systems. Addison-Wesley (1989) and Feynman's course on the physics of computation.R.P. Feynman, Feynman Lectures on Computation. Tony Hey and Robin W. Allen ed. Perseus Books Group (2000) At this point, Mead and Hopfield realized that a new field was emerging with neural scientists and the people doing the computer models and circuits all talking to each other. In the fall of 1986, John Hopfield championed forming an interdisciplinary Ph.D. program to give birth to a scholarly community studying questions arising at the interface between neurobiology and electrical engineering, computer science and physics. It was called Computation and Neural Systems (CNS). The unifying theme of the program was the relationship between the physical structure of a computational system (physical or biological hardware), the dynamics of its operation and the computational problems that it can efficiently solve. The creation of this multidisciplinary program stems largely from progress on several previously unrelated fronts: the analysis of complex neural systems at both the single- cell and the network levels D.J. Felleman, D.C. Van Essen. Distributed hierarchical processing in the primate cerebral cortex. Cerebral Cortex, 1 (1) (1991) using a variety of techniques (in particular, patch clamp recordings, intracellular and extra-cellular single and multi-unit electrophysiology in the awake animal and functional brain imaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)), the theoretical analysis of nervous structures (computational neuroscience) and the modeling of artificial neural networks for engineering purposes. The program started out with a small number of existing faculty in the various divisions. Amongst the early founding faculty were Carver Mead, John Hopfield, David van Essen, Geoffrey Fox, James Bower, Mark Konishi, John Allman, Ed Posner and Demetri Psaltis. In that year, the first external professor, Christof Koch, was hired. Since 1990, about 110 graduate students have been awarded a PhD in CNS and 14 a MS in CNS. About two-thirds of CNS graduates pursued an academic career, with the remaining CNS graduates founding and/or joining start-up companies. Over this time, the average duration of PhD has been 5.6 years. During this time, the executive officers of the CNS Program were John Hopfield, Demetri Psaltis, Christof Koch and Pietro Perona.

Its main activities are associated with English language teaching, examination preparation, teacher training, scholarships for teachers and cultural activities. The Foundation began as the Instituto Anglo Mexicano de Cultura A.C. in 1943 with the aim of strengthening ties between Mexico and Great Britain through cultural exchange. The Foundation took on its current name in 2003, which was accompanied by a reorganization. Schools Most of the instruction associated with the Foundation is through The Anglo, which gives classes in the English language, standardized test preparation and teacher training. English language teaching has been the main activity of the foundation with The Anglo operating for over sixty-eight years. Most of its success comes from the quality and commitment of its teachers and staff. Some of these courses include in house classes or general language and standardized test preparation and specialty courses for businesses. Teacher training and scholarship programs mainly focus on the professional development of Mexican national teachers of English. Programs offered to these teachers include pre service courses such as The Pre school Teaching Course, The Primary Teaching Course and The Teacher Training Course. Some of the in-service courses for teachers are The In-Service Teacher Training Course and The Teacher Development Course. It is worth mentioning that several of these courses have recognition by SEP. The Anglo is also the largest authorized Cambridge ESOL exam centre in Mexico. Cambridge ESOL, offers the world‚Äôs leading range of certificates for learners of English. The tests offered by its Centre of Exams Unit are designed at all levels of English from the Key English Test (KET) for the basic level, the Preliminary English Test (PET) for intermediate, the First Certificate in English (FCE) for upper-intermediate, the Certificate in Advanced English (CAE) for advanced learners and the Certificate of Proficiency in English (CPE) for those candidates with a very advanced level of English. In 1998, the Foundation established The Churchill School and in 2003 The Churchill College. The School provides education for students from kindergarten through primary/middle school. The College focuses on high school/preparatory students. These schools are bilingual with an international focus and are members of the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IB). Other programs Since 1943, the Foundation has supported cultural events with the purpose of strengthening ties between Mexico and Great Britain. These include music, theater, dance, visual arts, cinema and conferences. The Foundation also develops cultural materials for both its own and other schools, which occur both in Mexico and the United Kingdom. The Foundation sponsors regularly occurring film events with a schedule available online. Cultural and educational exchanges include representing the GAP Project in Mexico, and offering scholarships as part of the United World Colleges program. Selected candidates complete the English Language Scholarships in different places in the world. In 2010, the ‚ÄúAn encounter with Bob Geldof‚Äù conference was held at the National Auditorium. Geldof was accompanied by Jos√© Are√°n, an internationally recognized Mexican musician. Another event in the same year was the presentation of a compilation of letters written in the 19th century about Mexico by Scotswoman Fanny Calder√≥n de la Barca. This was a joint event between the Foundation and the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes . In 2011, cultural offering include readings by Welsh writer Owen Sheers and recitals by pianist Ann Martin-Davis and mezzo-soprano Susan Legg. In collaboration with the Museo Nacional de Arte, the Foundation presents the documentary ‚ÄúNo Distance Left to Run‚Äù by Will Lovelace and Dylan Southern. With theatre magazine ‚ÄúPaso de Gato,‚Äù the Foundation sponsored an event dedicated to English theatre inviting critics such as Aleks Sierz of In-yer- face theatre, Scottish critic Mark Fisher and Michael Billington, a critic based in London.

Some of EvoShield products are wrist guards, elbow guards, as well as rib and heart protectors for the sports of baseball, gridiron football, lacrosse and softball. EvoShield patented the \\"Gel-to-Shell\\" technology, a material that reacts with elements in the air and turns the product from a soft, moldable material to a hard and durable shell. In October 2016, the company was acquired by Wilson Sporting Goods Co., a subsidiary of Amer Sports Corporation. Wilson currently manufactures and sells high performance gloves, bats, uniforms, apparel, protective gear, accessories, and player development equipment and training tools through its Wilson Ball Glove, Louisville Slugger, DeMarini and ATEC brands. The Company markets and sells EvoShield- branded products through its baseball and softball business unit. Wilson will market and sell EvoShield as a stand-alone brand, similar to how it is sold today.  History  EvoShield was established in 2006http://www.sporttechie.com/2012/09/26/every-redskins-fan-should-thank- this-guy-interview-with-evoshield-co-founder-justin-niefer-222/ under the name All Sports Armour. Initial expertise was derived from a chemist, a cardiologist, and a group of former collegiate and professional athletes. After two years of extensive research, design, field and lab testing, the founders released their impact-dispersing protection to the public in 2007. The boss brand has undergone extensive growth since its inception, and is currently endorsed by several well-known athletes. In 2010, EvoShield increased its visibility with a strong presence in the retail market. Products are widely available at such sporting goods retailers as Dick's Sporting Goods, The Sports Authority, Hibbett Sports, Sport Chalet, and Academy Sports and Outdoors among others.  Technology  EvoShield‚Äôs protective shields are made of a unique porous composite material that hardens with exposure to air. As the shields harden, they form to the shape of the athlete‚Äôs body, creating a custom fit protective guard. The material begins soft and flexible, but the chemical components inside the gel-like pads begin to harden when the shields are removed from the foil bag. In about 20‚Äì30 minutes, the once soft pad transforms into a hard and protective guard that is permanently molded to the desired shape. Results from intensive impact deformation testing have shown that EvoShield products disperse the force of impact better than EVA foam and hard plastic, the most common materials found in sports protection. The results, shown below, are measures of backface deformation. Backface deformation is the effect of a non-penetrating projectile on the rear face of a strike plate. It essentially measures how far an object is allowed to protrude against a protective surface. The extent of allowable deformation set by NIJ is 44 mm.‚ÄùErwin, Sandra.Army‚Äôs Procedures for Testing Body Armor Stir Controversy. NDIA, 2009.

An express train named \\"Asahi\\" from Xinjing, Manchukuo to Rajin was put into service in 1936 to connect to the ferry to Japan.ÂçóÊ∫ÄÂ∑ûÈâÑÈÅìÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æÂÖ®Ë∑ØÁ∑ö After the end of the Korean War the Ungra Line was combined with several others to create the Hambuk Line as it is today. The construction of the Korean-Russian Friendship Bridge across the Tumen River, along with the Hong≈≠i Line from Tumangang to Hong≈≠i on the Hambuk Line in 1959 created a direct rail connection between North Korea and the Soviet Union; this, along with the extension in 1965 of the P'y≈èngra Line to Rajin, meeting up with the terminus of the Hambuk Line. This turned Rajin station into one of the most important stations on the entirety of the North Korean rail network, handling vast amounts of freight traffic to and from the Soviet Union and the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe. In 2008 work was begun to convert the line from the DPRK-Russia border to the port at Rajin to dual (standard and Russian) gauge, including the entirety of the Hong≈≠i Line and the Hong≈≠i-Rajin section of the Hambuk Line.

Biography Catlin was born in Red Hook, New York, to Mr. and Mrs. Pierce Catlin. His early education was in a private school in Litchfield County, Connecticut, and the Kingston Academy in Ulster County, New York. As a student, in 1841, he studied law in the office of Forsyth & Lindermau in Kingston, New York. In 1844, he was admitted to the bar of the New York Supreme Court. For four years, Catlin practiced law in New York City.White, James T. (Ed.). The National cyclopaedia of American biography. James T. White & Company. 1898. Page 87.Amos P. Catlin On January 8, 1849, Catlin traveled by ship from New York City to San Francisco. From there, he went to Mormon Island near Folsom, California. While living there, Catlin mined and practiced law. In 1850, he moved to Sacramento and began to practice law there. While living in Sacramento, Catlin witnessed the Squatters' Riot. Soon after, he returned to Mormon Island and resumed mining in the claims he had acquired previously in 1849. His practice in Mormon Island also resumed and he was hired to settle the affairs of the Connecticut Mining and Trading Company, which held interest in the famous store of Samuel Brannan. During his return to Mormon Island, William L. Goggin, agent for the Department of the Post Office on the west coast, asked Catlin for a name for the new post office being set up on Mormon Island. Catlin offered the name \\"Natoma\\", meaning clear water in the local native dialect. Catlin had already established the Natoma Mining Company to do his mining work. Once the post office was established in that area of Sacramento County, it became the Natoma Township.Shuck, Oscar T. (Ed.). History of the Bench and Bar of California.

In 1852, after a failed attempt at getting an Assembly seat, Catlin was elected to the State Senate. During his tenure as State Senator, he authored the law that made Sacramento the permanent seat of government in the State of California. In 1857, he was elected to the State Assembly for Sacramento County. In 1872, Catlin was appointed to be one of three members of the State Board of Equalization. He served in that capacity until 1876, when the Supreme Court of California declared most of the powers granted to the Board were unconstitutional and it was abolished. In 1875, Catlin was proposed as a candidate for Governor of California, but lost the nomination to John Bidwell. In 1890, Catlin was elected as a judge in the Superior Court of Sacramento County. He served until 1897 and then went back to his private practice. =Death= Catlin died November 5, 1900, in Sacramento, California.

It was the second single from their fourth studio album Clutching at Straws. Released on 13 July 1987, it peaked at number 22 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's eighth top-thirty hit in a row. Outside the UK, it was released in France, Republic of Ireland, Netherlands, Portugal, West Germany and (on Capitol Records) in the United States and Canada. Background A protest song which directly addresses the devastating effect unemployment can have on personal relationships, the track takes the form of a melancholic rock ballad with lyrics from the perspective of a British worker who emigrates to the U.S. to find a job, leaving behind his family. He ends up in despair, drinking in a hotel bar in Milwaukee and blaming the government for leaving him out of work. Lyricist Fish described the background as follows: > I was laying in bed in the Holiday Inn and looking up at the ceiling at some > hearts 'n' stuff that some lovers had carved, and I was feeling really down. > So I rang my old lady but it was a bad phone call; lots of long silences. I > felt even more depressed.Marillion - Explanation of Song Elements - That > Time Of The Night The first-person narrator sums up his feelings with the metaphor \\"We're just sugar mice in the rain\\", which lends the title to the song.marillion.com  MUSIC - Lyrics - Clutching at Straws  The Official Marillion Website Performing it at the band's concert Live from Loreley in 1987, Fish dedicated it to \\"all the unemployed people in Europe today, to the romantics, to the dreamers and to those who still have hearts\\".

From 1537 to 1548, he was Count of Kladsko and pledge lord of the County of Kladsko.  Life  John of Pernstein was a member of the Moravian noble Pernstein family. His parents were William II of Pernstein and Johanna of Liblitz (). Little is known about John's childhood. He probably spent most of it at the family castle at Pardubice; he also stayed some time in Breslau. In 1497, John and his younger brother Vojtƒõch I of Pernstein were knighted at Pardubice Castle by King Vladislav II of Hungary, who was travelling from Prague to Hungary. In 1506, John was appointed High Treasurer of Moravia. After 1515, he was Landeshauptmann of Moravia several times. Before 1521, he called himself John of Tobitschau (Jan z Tovaƒçova), after the castle where he and his family lived. When his father died in 1521, Vojtƒõch I inherited his father's Bohemian possessions, and John inherited the Moravian possessions. From 1521 until his death, he called himself John of Helfenstein, after his Moravian castle, even though he spent much of his time at a castle he had built in Prostƒõjov. Shortly after their father's death, both brothers converted to the Utraquist faith. John fought in the Ottoman wars and participated in 1526 with Moravian troops on the Battle of Moh√°cs, where King Louis II of Hungary was killed. When his brother Vojtƒõch I died in 1534, John inherited his extensive Bohemian estates and became one of the richest land owners in Czech countries, leading to his nickname \\"John the Rich\\". Prostƒõjov Castle John had a strong sense of art and in 1516 he founded the first literary circle in Moravia, in T≈ôeb√≠ƒç. On his estates, he promoted Renaissance architecture. Between 1522 and 1530, he had a castle built in Prostƒõjov, where he lived with his family. Between 1536 and 1543, he built the St. Ursula Church in Chlumec nad Cidlinou. In 1538, he started the construction of a castle in Vala≈°sk√© Mezi≈ô√≠ƒç√≠ as well as the reconstruction of the Pardubice castle in Renaissance style. Pern≈°tejn Castle, which his father had neglected, was rebuilt and expanded during John's reign and remodeled as a representative palace. From 1540 to 1546, he minted coins in K≈Çodzko in a Renaissance style. The obverse shows a picture of a bust of John, to emphasize the territorial sovereignty of the County of Kladsko. His views on religion and Bohemian state policy were opposed to those of King Ferdinand I. Where John represented the interests of the Estates, Ferdinand tried to limit their power. Towards the end of his lifetime, John the Rich found himself in financial difficulties. In 1543, he had to sell off the Lordship of Riesenburg and a year later, he had to sell the Lordships of N√°chod and Lan≈°perk, as well as parts of the dominion of Pot≈°tejn with Litice Castle and Brandys nad Orlici. John died on 8 September 1548 at his castle in ≈Ωidlochovice in southern Moravia. He was buried in the Holy Cross Church in Doubravn√≠k. This church had been destroyed during the Hussite Wars and John had rebuilt it. His territories were divided among his sons. His third wife Magdalena of Ormosd survived him by eight years. The disintegration of his fortune continued after his death, when his son Jaroslav had to sell off the Moravian estates.  John's influence in Silesia  After the death of Duke Casimir II of Cieszyn (Teschen, Tƒõ≈°√≠n) in 1528, John took up the guardianship of Casimir's grandson Wenceslaus III Adam, whose father, Wenceslaus II had died in 1524, before Wenceslaus III Adam was born. A treaty to that effect had been concluded before Casimir II's death and they had also decided that John's daughter Marie would later marry Wenceslaus III Adam, which she did in 1540. In a secret addendum to this treaty, they had arranged that if ever Casimir's family would die out in the male line, then the Duchy of Teschen would fall to John or his descendants.M√∂glicher Possible transition of the Duchy of Cieszyn to the Pernstein family  John as a Count of Kladsko  In 1537, King Ferdinand I of Bohemia mortgaged the County of Kladsko, which belonged immediately to Bohemia, to John of Pernstein for . John also received the title of Count of Kladsko and the right to mint coins in Kladsko. Since John, unlike Ferdinand, sympathized with the Reformation, he supported spread of Lutheranism and Utraquism in territory of Kladsko Land.Tolerating non-Catholics John settled several disputes between the estates and regulated brewing rights. Although he supported the 1547 Bohemian uprising, the Estates of Kladsko did not participate in the rebellion and consequently, his county was spared when the King punished the rebellious areas. As early as 1546, two years before John's death, his sons were started negotiations with Ernest of Bavaria, the administrator of Salzburg, about the possibility of selling the County of Kladsko to him. After the Estates of Bohemia accepted Ernest as a landed subject, the County of Kladsko was transferred to him on 14 November 1549. A dispute arose when John's son Vratislav refused to sell him the Lordship of Hummel, western part of the Kladsko area. This Lordship had been administratively part of Kladsko since 1477, but Vratislav argued it was still a separate Lordship and had been acquired separately by John in 1541. When Ernest threatened to call off the whole transaction, Vratislav gave in and handed him Hummel, including the towns of Duszniki Zdr√≥j and Lewin K≈Çodzki.Purchase of the County of Glatz and the Lordship of Hummel  Marriage and issue  John of Pernstein was married three times. In 1507 he married Anna of Kostka of Postupic, who died in 1526. They had the following children: * Margaret (Mark√©ta) (1514‚Äì1529), married in 1529 Henry II of M√ºnsterberg * Joan (born: 1516), married John the Younger of ≈Ωerot√≠n * Catherine (Kate≈ôina) (1518-1552?), married in 1533 Henry of ≈†vamberk (Jind≈ôich ze ≈†vamberka) * Marie (1524‚Äì1566), married in 1540 Wenceslaus III Adam of Cieszyn His second wife was in 1528 Hedvika of ≈†elmberk, who died in 1535. They had the following children: * Jaroslav (1528‚Äì1560), married in 1552 Elizabeth Thurzo of Bethlenfalvy (d. 1573) * Vratislav II (1530‚Äì1582), married in 1555 Maria Manrique de Lara (d. 1608) * Vojtƒõch II of Pernstein (1532‚Äì1561) (), married in 1556 Catherine Kostka of Postupic (d. 1564) * Catherine (Kate≈ôina) (1534‚Äì1571), married in 1550 Eck of Salm John married in 1544 with Magdalena of Ormozd (d. 1556), a widow of the Hungarian magnate Alexei Thurzo of Bethlenfalva.

Life  Nothing so far is known about his life. It may be assumed, though, that Hely was taught to play the lute by musicians of John Dowland's generation. If so, Cuthbert Hely may have been born around 1570. It was believed that Hely may have been Lord Herbert's lute teacher and that he was the compiler of Lord Herbert's lute book. Both these points seem unlikely, though, as Lord Herbert, by his own account, learned the lute around 1603 \\"with very little or no teaching,\\" and Hely's contributions to Lord Herbert's lute book are only found in the hand of \\"Scribe C,\\" whose entries are the latest in the manuscript, datable to 1639-1640. It is uncertain if the composer is identical with a certain Cuthbert Hely who lived in Ludlow, England, during this era.  Works  Eight compositions by Cuthbert Hely - four fantasias, three preludes, and a sarabande - are to be found in the lute book owned by Edward, Lord Herbert of Cherbury. Only one other work of Cuthbert Hely has been known so far, an air in four parts found in GB-Lbl Add.18940, a manuscript source dated to about 1650. Although only a few works have survived, Cuthbert Hely's music is an example of 17th-century English lute music at its summit, attempting to bring Elizabethan \\"Golden Age\\" practices into the first phase of the Baroque era. His intensive and sometimes strongly melancholy style is carried over from the work of earlier composers such as John Dowland.  Edition  * Literature * R.T.

Overview The project investigated the feasibility of one geoengineering technique: solar radiation management using stratospheric sulfur aerosols. This could produce the same type of global cooling effect as a large volcanic eruption ‚Äì such as Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in June 1991 (but without any disruption from hot lava, ash or smoke, which would not be present). In the two years following that eruption the Earth cooled on average by about half a degree Celsius. The SPICE project investigated whether or not these natural processes can be mimicked and, if so, with what effect. It was one of the first UK projects aimed at providing evidence-based knowledge about geoengineering technologies. The project itself did not involve carrying out geoengineering, but it investigated the feasibility of doing so. SPICE sought to shed light on some of the uncertainties surrounding this controversial subject, and encourage debate to help inform any future research and decision-making. Geoengineering is seen as being potentially useful in combating climate change but could also lead to unforeseen or unintended risks ‚Äì for example on local weather systems, or discouraging people to take action to reduce carbon emissions. The project was funded by a ¬£1.6m grant by the EPSRC to run from October 2010 to March 2014. SPICE - 1km testbed Project status In October 2011 a planned outdoor test (named 1km testbed at a 1/20 scale) was delayed for six months, as a result of controversy surrounding the research. The project oversight panel decided that more public engagement and better transparency was needed. In May 2012 the first field test was cancelled altogether in agreement of all project partners. Dr. Matthew Watson, the project's lead scientist, named two reasons for the cancellation: First, project scientists had submitted patents for similar technology, presenting a potentially significant conflict of interest. In addition to that, concerns about the lack of government regulation of such geoengineering projects were raised. Although the field testing was cancelled, the project panel decided to continue the lab-based elements of the project. Work packages The SPICE project consisted of three strands of research (Work Packages): =Evaluating candidate particles = Researchers from the Universities of Bristol, Oxford and Cambridge and the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory considered what would be an ‚Äòideal‚Äô particle to inject into the stratosphere. The researchers aimed to identify a particle with excellent solar radiation scattering properties, and consider what potential impacts might be on climate, weather, ecosystems and human health. =Delivery systems= Engineers from the University of Cambridge and Marshall Aerospace planned to assess the effect of wind on a tethered ballon at a height of 1 km while at the same time pumping water at a rate of around 100 kg/hour. They hoped to use the data obtained from these tests in computer models aimed at examining how a full-scale tethered balloon might behave in the high winds experienced at altitudes up 20 km. =Climate and environmental modelling= Researchers from the Universities of Oxford, Edinburgh and Bristol worked with the Met Office's Hadley Centre to consider what can be learned from past volcanic eruptions. They also modelled the potential impact on ozone layer concentrations, regional precipitation changes and atmospheric chemistry. Public engagement A consultation exercise was undertaken with members of the public in a parallel project by Cardiff University, with specific exploration of attitudes to the SPICE test. This research found that almost all participants were willing to allow the field trial to proceed, but very few were comfortable with the actual use of stratospheric aerosols. The project was presented to the public at the British Science Festival in Bradford, 13 September 2011 to coincide with plans to conduct the 1 km delivery system testbed in Norfolk the following month. However, this was later postponed for six months following advice from a Phase‚Äìgate model advisory panel to \\"allow more time for engagement with stakeholders\\". Following the original announcement, a campaign opposing geoengineering led by the ETC Group drafted an open letter calling for the project to be suspended until international agreement is reached, specifically pointing to the upcoming convention of parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2012.  Research  Early research so far includes showing that many state of the art climate models do not successfully simulate the atmospheric circulation changes following large volcanic eruptions, which is \\"of concern for the accuracy of geoengineering modeling studies that assess the atmospheric response to stratosphere-injected particles.\\", led by Simon Driscoll, the detailing of radiative properties of possible candidate particles, led by Francis Pope, and assessments of costs and lead times for technological development of various lifting options for stratospheric aerosols, led by Peter Davidson. Research led by Jim Haywood supported by the SPICE programme shows \\"large asymmetric stratospheric aerosol loadings concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere are a harbinger of Sahelian drought whereas those concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere induce a greening of the Sahel.\\" which is particularly of concern for the impacts of geoengineering because \\"The Sahelian drought of the 1970s‚Äì1990s was one of the largest humanitarian disasters of the past 50 years, causing up to 250,000 deaths and creating 10 million refugees.\\". SPICE member Simon Driscoll has expressed caution about sulphate aerosol geoengineering given that we do not yet know the full effects and that there may be adverse effects from unintended consequences of sulphate aerosol geoengineering.

It separates water of the lakes Krammer and Volkerak from the Oosterschelde. This dam connects the Grevelingendam to Sint Philipsland. History Construction began in late 1976 by erecting an artificial island on the sand Plaat van Vliet. Eighteen months later, when the island was completed, construction of locks began for inland navigation and yachts. In 1983 the complex of locks Krammer was completed. The dam officially opened on February 2, 1987. In 1994, a second lock was built for yachts. Locks The locks are technically sophisticated because they must avoid the exchange between the freshwater Volkerak and the brackish water of the Oosterschelde. The locks are designed so that there is no influx of saltwater that enters the Volkerak and only a little fresh water in the Oosterschelde. The locks rely on the physical principle that saltwater is denser and sinks, while freshwater rises. By a complex system of pipes and pumps the saltwater is pumped from the bottom, or conversely, freshwater is pumped from the top, depending on the direction of the ship. Locks on inland waterways are 280 metres long and 24 metres wide. Environmental impacts The dam considerably changed the surrounding landscape. Alluvial tidal marsh now support a rich animal life. An observation hut was installed to facilitate the observation of the many species of birds such as the pied avocet.

Though less-remembered than superstars like Mary Pickford, she had a number of starring roles from 1917 to the early 1920s and was one of the young female stars of her day. Film career Still of Leslie in the Vitagraph release The Wooing of Princess Pat (1918) Leslie began her movie career around 1915, acting in short films produced by the Edison Company. By 1917, she was making films with the Thanhouser Company in New Rochelle, New York, including The Vicar of Wakefield (1917). The New York Herald's review of that film dubbed her the \\"Girl With A Million Dollar Smile,\\" and caused studio head Edwin Thanhouser to decide she was ready for leading roles. Soon she was starring in the lead role in 1917's An Amateur Orphan, but was quickly wooed over to Vitagraph Studios and starred in a number of Vitagraph releases in 1918 and 1919. Leslie and another young female Vitagraph star, Bessie Love, starred in numerous films in young girl- type roles that were popular at the time.Bennett, Whitman (June 1920).

Infection On an airplane, people sit in a confined space for extended periods of time, which increases the risk of transmission of airborne infections. For this reason, airlines place restrictions on the travel of passengers with known airborne contagious diseases (e.g. tuberculosis). During the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic of 2003, awareness of the possibility of acquisition of infection on a commercial aircraft reached its zenith when on one flight from Hong Kong to Beijing, 16 of 120 people on the flight developed proven SARS from a single index case. There is very limited research done on contagious diseases on aircraft. The two most common respiratory pathogens to which air passengers are exposed are parainfluenza and influenza. In one study, the flight ban imposed following the attacks of September 11, 2001 was found to have restricted the global spread of seasonal influenza, resulting in a much milder influenza season that year, and the ability of influenza to spread on aircraft has been well documented. There is no data on the relative contributions of large droplets, small particles, close contact, surface contamination, and no data on the relative importance of any of these methods of transmission for specific diseases, and therefore very little information on how to control the risk of infection. There is no standardisation of air handling by aircraft, installation of HEPA filters or of hand washing by air crew, and no published information on the relative efficacy of any of these interventions in reducing the spread of infection. Air travel, like other forms of travel, radically increases the speed at which infections spread around the world, as viruses rapidly spread to large numbers of people living across the world. Human and cargo traffic greatly facilitates the spread of pathogens across the world, for example during the COVID-19 pandemic. Deep vein thrombosis Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is the third most common vascular disease next to stroke and heart attack. It is estimated that DVT affects one in 5,000 travellers on long flights. Risk increases with exposure to more flights within a short time frame and with increasing duration of flights. According to a health expert in Canada, even though the risk of a blood clot is low, given the number of people who fly, it is a public health risk. It is reported in 2016 that the average distance between seat rows has declined to 79 centimetres, from over 89 centimetres, while the average seat size has shrunk to 43 centimetres from 46 centimetres in the previous two decades. Radiation exposure Flying high, passengers and crews of jet airliners are exposed to at least 10 times the cosmic ray dose that people at sea level receive. Every few years, a geomagnetic storm permits a solar particle event to penetrate down to jetliner altitudes. Aircraft flying polar routes near the geomagnetic poles are at particular risk.Evaluation of the Cosmic Ray Exposure of Aircraft Crew There is also increased radiation from space.Protection of air crew from cosmic radiation: Guidance material Other possible health hazards Other possible hazards of air travel that have been investigated include airsickness and chemical contamination of cabin air. In pregnancy In low risk pregnancies, most health care providers approve flying until about 36 weeks of gestational age.Page 173 in: Most airlines allow pregnant women to fly short distances at less than 36 weeks, and long distances at less than 32 weeks.Page 57 in: Many airlines require a doctor's note that approves flying, specially at over 28 weeks.

Manufacturer The Class GH, the heavy passenger version of the Class U Union Garratt, was designed and built by Maffei in Munich, Germany, to the specifications of Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR). Two locomotives were delivered in 1928, numbered 2320 and 2321. They were erected at the Salt River shops in Cape Town. If the same classification practice as that which was used for Garratt and Mallet locomotives had been followed, the Classes GH and U Union Garratts should have been designated Class UA and Class UB respectively. During the design phase of the two Union Garratt types, they were designated classification letters in the regular SAR Garratt range as Classes GH and GJ respectively. When orders were placed with the manufacturers, however, the Class designation of the Class GH was retained while that of the Class GJ Double Prairie type was changed to Class U. The reasoning behind this inconsistency is not known.Drawing: 2-6-2-2-6-2 Type Garratt Engine, Class GJ (Ordered as Class U). S.A.R. Mechanical Department, Drawing Office, Pretoria, 29-10-25. Approved by F.R. Collins, Chief Mechanical Engineer, 31-10-25. (Class U 2-6-2+2-6-2 drawing). Characteristics The locomotives were superheated and had round-topped fireboxes, bar frames, Walschaerts valve gear and Z-ported cylinders with short-lap, short-travel valves. The design of the two Union Garratt types deviated from the Garratt principle, the patent of which was held by Beyer, Peacock and Company, and the end results were hybrid locomotives, part Garratt and part Modified Fairlie. The front end of the locomotive was of a typical Garratt arrangement with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit's frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion with the coal bunker mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive's main frame and with the pivoting rear engine unit positioned beneath the coal bunker.Soul of A Railway, System 1, Part 2: Cape Town to Wellington. Caption 3. (Accessed on 26 November 2016) Since the rear bunker carried only coal, an additional large underbelly water tank under the boiler compensated for the resulting diminished water capacity. All the engine's water was carried in the front bunker tank and in the underbelly water tank, with a combined capacity of , while the rear bunker had a coal capacity of . The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, coal bunker, as well as the underbelly water tank. The Class GH were massive and powerful locomotives and, having been designed for passenger service, were built for speed with their large diameter coupled wheels. With their firegrates, they were equipped with mechanical stokers of the duplex type. One reason which was put forward for the construction of the rear end of the Union Garratts on the Modified Fairlie principle was to enable their coal bunkers to be rigidly in line with their boiler frames to ensure a satisfactory arrangement for the installation of mechanical stokers. The subsequent designs of the Classes GL and GM Garratts showed that this precaution was unnecessary. Shortcomings The Modified Fairlies and the Union Garratt variations of it were not successful in South Africa and they suffered from the same shortcomings. On the Union Garratts, as on the Modified Fairlies, the frames were prone to metal fatigue and cracking, brought about by the long frame overhang at the rear beyond the engine unit pivot centre. The overhang, laden with the coal bunker which extended completely beyond the rear engine unit's pivot centre was subjected to severe vertical oscillation while the locomotive was in motion and this led to structural weakening of the frame over time. In addition, since the coal bunker was mounted on the frame instead of on the engine unit, the rear pivot bearings were subject to quite rapid wear since they carried a considerable additional vertical load compared to those on a purebred Garratt. As was the case with the Modified Fairlies, this resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and as a consequence, increased operating cost. Service The Class GH was acquired for working the named fast passenger trains of the era, the Union Express and Union Limited, and was initially shedded in Cape Town. The service career of the Class GH had a rough start, however, since on the first trip it was discovered that it exceeded the loading gauge in width. It returned to Salt River minus its steps and sundry fittings after having scraped the platforms of every station along its route. Considerable modifications had to be carried out before the two locomotives could be placed back in regular service. The Class GH made several trips working the Union Express out of Cape Town and was capable of taking the train up Hex River Railpass without a banker, but they were not as successful as had been hoped and they were soon taken off that duty. Their mechanical stokers also proved to be troublesome and were eventually removed. They were transferred to Natal and worked on the Natal mainline north of Glencoe for the rest of their service lives. Both were withdrawn from service by 1958.

PHWRs frequently use natural uranium as fuel, but sometimes also use very low enriched uranium. The heavy water coolant is kept under pressure to avoid boiling, allowing it to reach higher temperature (mostly) without forming steam bubbles, exactly as for pressurized water reactor. While heavy water is very expensive to isolate from ordinary water (often referred to as light water in contrast to heavy water), its low absorption of neutrons greatly increases the neutron economy of the reactor, avoiding the need for enriched fuel. The high cost of the heavy water is offset by the lowered cost of using natural uranium and/or alternative fuel cycles. As of the beginning of 2001, 31 PHWRs were in operation, having a total capacity of 16.5 GW(e), representing roughly 7.76% by number and 4.7% by generating capacity of all current operating reactors. Purpose of using heavy water The key to maintaining a nuclear chain reaction within a nuclear reactor is to use, on average, exactly one of the neutrons released from each nuclear fission event to stimulate another nuclear fission event (in another fissionable nucleus). With careful design of the reactor's geometry, and careful control of the substances present so as to influence the reactivity, a self-sustaining chain reaction or \\"criticality\\" can be achieved and maintained. Natural uranium consists of a mixture of various isotopes, primarily 238U and a much smaller amount (about 0.72% by weight) of 235U. 238U can only be fissioned by neutrons that are relatively energetic, about 1 MeV or above. No amount of 238U can be made \\"critical\\" since it will tend to parasitically absorb more neutrons than it releases by the fission process. 235U, on the other hand, can support a self-sustained chain reaction, but due to the low natural abundance of 235U, natural uranium cannot achieve criticality by itself. The trick to achieving criticality using only natural or low enriched uranium, for which there is no \\"bare\\" critical mass, is to slow down the emitted neutrons (without absorbing them) to the point where enough of them may cause further nuclear fission in the small amount of 235U which is available. (238U which is the bulk of natural uranium is also fissionable with fast neutrons.) This requires the use of a neutron moderator, which absorbs virtually all of the neutrons' kinetic energy, slowing them down to the point that they reach thermal equilibrium with surrounding material. It has been found beneficial to the neutron economy to physically separate the neutron energy moderation process from the uranium fuel itself, as 238U has a high probability of absorbing neutrons with intermediate kinetic energy levels, a reaction known as \\"resonance\\" absorption. This is a fundamental reason for designing reactors with separate solid fuel segments, surrounded by the moderator, rather than any geometry that would give a homogeneous mix of fuel and moderator. Water makes an excellent moderator; the ordinary hydrogen or protium atoms in the water molecules are very close in mass to a single neutron, and so their collisions result in a very efficient transfer of momentum, similar conceptually to the collision of two billiard balls. However, as well as being a good moderator, ordinary water is also quite effective at absorbing neutrons. And so using ordinary water as a moderator will easily absorb so many neutrons that too few are left to sustain a chain reaction with the small isolated 235U nuclei in the fuel, thus precluding criticality in natural uranium. Because of this, a light-water reactor will require that the 235U isotope be concentrated in its uranium fuel, as enriched uranium, generally between 3% to 5% 235U by weight (the by-product from this process enrichment process is known as depleted uranium, and so consisting mainly of 238U, chemically pure). The degree of enrichment needed to achieve criticality with a light-water moderator depends on the exact geometry and other design parameters of the reactor. One complication of this approach is the need for uranium enrichment facilities, which are generally expensive to build and operate. They also present a nuclear proliferation concern; the same systems used to enrich the 235U can also be used to produce much more \\"pure\\" weapons-grade material (90% or more 235U), suitable for producing a nuclear weapon. This is not a trivial exercise by any means, but feasible enough that enrichment facilities present a significant nuclear proliferation risk. An alternative solution to the problem is to use a moderator that does not absorb neutrons as readily as water. In this case potentially all of the neutrons being released can be moderated and used in reactions with the 235U, in which case there is enough 235U in natural uranium to sustain criticality. One such moderator is heavy water, or deuterium-oxide. Although it reacts dynamically with the neutrons in a fashion similar to light water (albeit with less energy transfer on average, given that heavy hydrogen, or deuterium, is about twice the mass of hydrogen), it already has the extra neutron that light water would normally tend to absorb.  Advantages and disadvantages The use of heavy water as the moderator is the key to the PHWR (pressurized heavy water reactor) system, enabling the use of natural uranium as the fuel (in the form of ceramic UO2), which means that it can be operated without expensive uranium enrichment facilities. The mechanical arrangement of the PHWR, which places most of the moderator at lower temperatures, is particularly efficient because the resulting thermal neutrons are \\"more thermal\\" than in traditional designs, where the moderator normally is much hotter. These features mean that a PHWR can use natural uranium and other fuels, and does so more efficiently than light water reactors (LWRs). Pressurised heavy-water reactors do have some drawbacks. Heavy water generally costs hundreds of dollars per kilogram, though this is a trade-off against reduced fuel costs. The reduced energy content of natural uranium as compared to enriched uranium necessitates more frequent replacement of fuel; this is normally accomplished by use of an on-power refuelling system. The increased rate of fuel movement through the reactor also results in higher volumes of spent fuel than in LWRs employing enriched uranium. Since unenriched uranium fuel accumulates a lower density of fission products than enriched uranium fuel, however, it generates less heat, allowing more compact storage. While with typical CANDU derived fuel bundles, the reactor design has a slightly positive Void coefficient of reactivity, the Argentina designed CARA fuel bundles used in Atucha I, are capable of the preferred negative coefficient. Nuclear proliferation Heavy-water reactors may pose a greater risk of nuclear proliferation versus comparable light-water reactors due to the low neutron absorption properties of heavy water, discovered in 1937 by Hans von Halban and Otto Frisch. Occasionally, when an atom of 238U is exposed to neutron radiation, its nucleus will capture a neutron, changing it to 239U. The 239U then rapidly undergoes two Œ≤‚àí decays ‚Äî both emitting an electron and an antineutrino, the first one transmuting the 239U into 239Np, and the second one transmuting the 239Np into 239Pu. Although this process takes place with other moderators such as ultra-pure graphite or beryllium, heavy water is by far the best. 239Pu is a fissile material suitable for use in nuclear weapons. As a result, if the fuel of a heavy-water reactor is changed frequently, significant amounts of weapons-grade plutonium can be chemically extracted from the irradiated natural uranium fuel by nuclear reprocessing. In addition, the use of heavy water as a moderator results in the production of small amounts of tritium when the deuterium nuclei in the heavy water absorb neutrons, a very inefficient reaction. Tritium is essential for the production of boosted fission weapons, which in turn enable the easier production of thermonuclear weapons, including neutron bombs. It is unclear whether it is possible to use this method to produce tritium on a practical scale. The proliferation risk of heavy-water reactors was demonstrated when India produced the plutonium for Operation Smiling Buddha, its first nuclear weapon test, by extraction from the spent fuel of a heavy-water research reactor known as the CIRUS reactor.

It is among the country's sixteen holiest Buddhist shrines (Solosmasthana). According to contemporary history, the Gautama Buddha visited the site after five years of attaining Enlightenment to settle the dispute between two warring Naga kings, Chulodara and Mahodara. Ancient history according to the Mahavamsa chronicles and the Tamil Buddhist epic Manimekalai mentions a gem-studded throne and a stone with the Buddha‚Äôs footprint at the island Nainativu, (also known as Nagadeepa) which pilgrims from India visited. History and development Buddha's visit to Nagadeepa. Detail from Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara The site is known as the place where Lord Buddha came during his second visit to Sri Lanka, after five years of attaining Enlightenment, to intervene and mediate in settling a dispute between two Naga Kings, Chulodara and Mahodara over the possession of a gem-studded throne. When Buddha arrived and saw the Naga Kings prepared for fighting, Budhha used psychic powers to appear in the sky performing miracles. This made the Nagas astonished and happy. After having listened to the Dhamma sermons displaying Buddha's masterly knowledge of unity and harmony, meththa and compassion, the Naga kings paid homage to Budhha with overwhelming faith. The throne was offered to him in unison and they became pious devotees. A deity named Samiddhi Sumana, who had made the banyan tree his abode, accompanied him to Thathagatha while in Jetavanarama, holding the uprooted tree (Rajayathana tree) as an umbrella (parasol) to him. The Naga King Maniakkitha, ruler of Kelaniya, moved by the compassion of the Buddha, thanked him profusely for settling the dispute. He further pleaded for a souvenir to worship and consequently the Buddha offered him the Rajayathana tree and the throne. The Nagadeepa Vihara has been reconstructed, and developed in the times of king Devanampiya Tissa and Dutugemunu and to convert it into a sacred place.

He was a close friend and political associate of Sir John Davies, the Attorney General for Ireland; both were key figures in the Irish administration during this period.  Family  He was born at Higher Bockhampton, now Stinsford, in Dorset, the second son of Robert Jacob and Anne Steldon. The Jacob family were descended from William Jacob, who was living in Tolpuddle in 1450. Robert always valued his association with both towns, and when he applied for a coat of arms he described himself as Robert Jacob of Tolpuddle and Bockhampton.\\"Pedigree of Jacob of Tolpuddle and Bockhampton 1608 \\" National Library of Ireland In about 1603 he married Mary Lynch (died 1622), widow of David (died 1602); she was the daughter of William Lynch (or Linch), a merchant of Southampton. She had one surviving son, William (died 1627), by her first husband. Mary was a colourful character with a reputation for wit, who once publicly ridiculed the Spanish Ambassador, Count Gondomar. She and Robert has five children, Robert junior, Arthur, Francis, Mary junior and Anne. All of their children were still alive in 1617 when they are mentioned in their grandfather William Lynch's willWill of William Linch 1617, UK National Archives Catalogue reference prob/11/129 but only the younger Mary is definitely known to have been still living in 1623. She married Sir James Hamilton of Manor Elieston, a cousin of the Earl of Abercorn.Paul, Sir James Balfour The Scots Peerage Edinburgh 1904  Solicitor General  Not much is known about his education, nor when he was called to the Bar, or about his early legal career. He was knighted in 1601, and in 1606 he was sent to Ireland as Solicitor General. He was admitted to the King's Inn in 1607 and given chambers there in 1612.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 Like most successful men at this time he found jobs for his family: his brother Hammett became Clerk of the Peace for Dublin. Robert sat in the Irish House of Commons as one of the two MPs for Carlow in the Parliament of 1613‚Äì1615.The other was his fellow law officer Sir John Bere. The 1613 election was notable for the number of disputed results and Robert, who had the usual English settler's prejudice against the Old Irish, wrote that \\"Irish lawyers did more harm than the priests all combined in opposing the Crown's work\\" and complained that they were electing \\"seditious schismatics\\" (i.e. Roman Catholics) as members of Parliament.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland-the Court of Castle Chamber 1571‚Äì1641 Four Courts Press Dublin 2006 In fact when all the results were finalised Protestants had a slight majority in the Commons.

He was deeply concerned about the future of English rule in Ireland. After the Flight of the Earls he warned in a famous phrase that \\"there are 2000 idle men that had no means but to feed on the gentlemen of this country..he was accounted the bravest man that comes attended with most of these followers \\".Collis Ramsay History of Ulster 4 Volumes Gresham London 1920 He appears to have thought that the killing of Sir Cahir O'Doherty in 1608 would restore peace; yet the following year he was fearful of the possible return of Hugh O'Neill and the consequences for Ulster: \\"there are great probabilities that all the people of that province would easily run into rebellion if Tyrone (O'Neill) should return, or if any munition or aid should be sent to them from foreign parts\\". In 1612 he wrote a lengthy memorandum on the weakness of English rule in Ireland, for which he proposed two main remedies: the restoration of a standing army, and the expulsion of the Irish chiefs from troublesome parts of the country, and their replacement by large numbers of settlers.Canny, Nicholas Making Ireland British 1580‚Äì1650 Oxford University Press 2003 The ordinary Irish people in his view could be left in peace, while loyal Irish chiefs would be required to surrender only a small part of their lands to the Crown (thus increasing the Crown's revenue). Death Jacob's ambition and his undoubted ability ideally suited him to play a leading part in Irish affairs if Sir John Davies was recalled or promoted, but in the event he died in 1618, while Davies was still in office as Irish Attorney General. His widow Mary quickly remarried the well- known politician and poet Christopher Brooke, though she continued to use the title Lady Jacob. She had at least one more child, a son called John, and died in 1622.  Character  Jacob's attitude to the Irish people was stern, but in private life he seems to have been a kindly man. In 1617 he wrote a warm and encouraging latter to his good friend and colleague Sir John Davies about the sad condition of Davies' son Jack, who was deaf and dumb, and generally thought to be mentally deficient: \\" If your son Jack were now put into the hands of some skilful men, he might be brought to speak.

The house is the best example of Georgian architecture in Loudoun County. Rokeby served as a repository for U.S. Government documents during the British occupation and burning of Washington in 1814 during the War of 1812. The Declaration of Independence was reputedly kept in the basement. Description The main house is a two-story five-bay brick building standing on a low basement, with prominent end chimneys. The plan is two rooms deep with a central stair hall. A rear wing was added in 1886, using detailing that matched the original house. The main house is notable for its basement, in which the central portion features a brick barrel vault. A large kitchen was located in the basement; its hearth survives. Renovations have altered much of the interior detailing, adding Colonial revival trim and plaster detailing. The exterior is built entirely in Flemish bomd. History Rokeby was built around 1765 by Charles Binns, Sr. on a tract. His son inherited the house in 1801, and although William Binns did not live there, the empty house was used to store U.S. government documents at the direction of then-Secretary of State James Monroe. The house was purchased in 1830 by Benjamin Shreve, Jr., who altered the earlier clipped gables to their present form and who changed the interior trim details. At about 1886, under the ownership of O.E. Breese, the house was first called \\"Rokeby.\\" The Breese family made the additions to the rear of the house. It was restored in 1958.

Life He was son of Thomas Walker of Huddersfield, and was educated, like Richard Bentley, at Wakefield School, where he was under Edward Clarke. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, as a pensioner on 24 May 1710, at the age of seventeen. He was Craven scholar in 1712. He graduated B.A. in 1713, and was elected minor fellow on 28 September 1716. He took his M.A., and was elected socius major and sublector tertius in 1717. In 1719 he went to Paris, as Bentley's emissary, to collect readings for a proposed Gr√¶co-Latin New Testament, which had been projected by Bentley about 1716. J. J. Wetstein had been employed on the project, but had returned to Switzerland. Walker was well received at Paris, especially by the Maurists; after some suspicion of a clash of literary interests between their project for an edition of the Versio Itala and Bentley's undertaking, Walker received co-operation, especially from Vincent Thuillier, Pierre Sabatier, Simon Mopinot, and Bernard de Montfaucon. He remained in Paris for nearly a year. Walker collated the whole New Testament in five Latin manuscripts at Paris, and part of it in nine others, besides noting the readings of four Tours manuscripts collated by L√©on Chevallier, which were given him by Sabatier. Next year (1721) he returned to Paris, this time to collate Greek texts. The winter of 1721-2 was, however, spent in Brussels in the company of Charles Graham, 3rd Viscount Preston (died 1739). Here Walker collated the manuscript of Arnobius and Minucius Felix, and the Corsendonk Greek Testament, and succeeded in identifying many of the manuscripts used by Lucas Brugensis. When the fear of the plague had abated, Walker returned to Paris, and seems to have remained there till 1723. Walker also collated a number of manuscripts of Archbishop William Wake. Altogether Walker seems to have collated some seventy-eight Greek manuscripts, containing the whole or parts of the New Testament. Subsequently, he became dean and rector of Bocking, Essex, in the archbishop's patronage, 15 November 1725. He became chancellor of the diocese of St David's on 17 July 1727. His marriage followed six months later, 26 January 1728. He was made D.D. under royal commission (together with Richard Walker the vice-master) on 25 April 1728. Wake appointed him archdeacon of Hereford on 3 February 1729, and on 12 December 1730 rector of St. Mary Aldermary; he also became incumbent of St Thomas the Apostle in the same year. Walker was also chaplain to King George II. Walker died on 9 November 1741, at the age of 48. Works Walker made emendations of Cicero's De Natura Deorum, printed at the end of the edition of John Davies, President of Queens' College, Cambridge in 1718, and mentioned in the preface. Zachary Pearce also incorporated some notes of Walker's in his edition of the De Officiis in 1745. While working for the New Testament he also helped Bentley with various readings of manuscripts of Suetonius and Cicero's Tusculans. For his own part he was preparing an edition of Arnobius, and left his materials to Richard Mead. The collapse of his major literary project with Bentley was for reasons that are unclear. In any case Walker's death was followed shortly by Bentley's. Family Walker married in 1728 Charlotte Sheffield, one of the three illegitimate daughters of John Sheffield, 1st Duke of Buckingham and Normanby (died 1721), by Frances Stewart, who later married Hon. Oliver Lambart; these daughters (and their brother) took the name of Sheffield under their father's will. Charlotte Walker had a fortune of some ¬£6,000, and bore her husband six sons and four daughters. One of their sons, Henry, became fellow of King's College, Cambridge (B.A. 1757, M.A. 1760).

Velma herself was employed as a \\"school artist\\" in 1920. She was educated at East High School in Des Moines and studied art with Harriet Macy. She later studied with Charles Atherton Cumming and graduated from the Cumming School of Art in Des Moines where she then taught painting from 1926 to 1931. On 2 November 1929, she married Gerard M. Rayness in Des Moines, Iowa; both were students of the artist Cumming and both taught at the Cummings Art School. With her husband, she built a home and studio in 1934 at 3022 Oakland Street in Ames, Iowa, where she lived for over 50 years. Many Ames children and housewives took art lessons here. According to the Iowa census, Velma was living with her husband and her husband's parents in Ames City, Iowa, in 1930. She was listed as a \\"private school teacher\\" and her husband as a \\"public school teacher\\". They moved to Ames, Iowa, permanently in 1932 and opened a studio near Iowa State College. Andrew Rayness, Gerard's father, was occupied as a \\"college teacher\\" in 1930, which may have influenced Gerard and Velma's choice. They both taught art to adults and children, and she continued to teach after Gerard's death. Their studio was open for 23 years. She also worked under Grant Wood in the Public Works of Art program in 1933. Both Gerard and Velma were active in the Iowa Art Guild. Rayness was also an avid sketch artist, author and book illustrator. She sketched and wrote the book Campus Sketches of Iowa State College, published in Ames by the Iowa State University Press in 1949. The second edition of the book was published in 1962 and named Campus Sketches of Iowa State University. The first edition can be located at the Iowa State University libraries in their Special & General Collection department. Rayness also collaborated on Charles Atherton Cumming: Iowa's Pioneer Artist-Educator in 1972, published by the Iowa Art Guild. She also illustrated a book called The Corn is Ripe in 1944. Rayness is mentioned in the 1939 book, The First One Hundred Years of Iowa Artists by Zenobia Ness & Louise Orwig. Rayness was mentioned in Dictionary of Women Artists by Pettys, Who Was Who in American Art by Falk, Davenport's Art Reference & Price Guide, Index of Artists by Mallett, and several editions of American Art Annual. She can also be found in Who's Who of American Women by Marquis. She won numerous awards and prizes for her work as an artist. There are only three privately owned paintings currently known to exist. One of these is Roof Tops in Fall on gouache paper, which is a sketch/watercolor that measures 16x20\\", sold at auction in 2005. Rayness died in April 1977.

Russell served as Superintendent of Census Operations for the 1901 Census of India. Russell's father, Charles Robert Tilden Russell, was an officer in the Royal Navy. He was educated at Winchester College before attending Trinity College, Cambridge and then, in 1893, joining the Indian Civil Service. Together with an amateur archaeologist, Rai Bahadur Hira Lal, Russell compiled The Castes and Tribes of the Central Provinces, published in 1916. This work was a product of the Ethnographic Survey of India that had been established in 1901, although it differed somewhat from earlier publications of similar origin because it relied more on Vedic literature than on the anthropometric methods and theories of Herbert Hope Risley and his sympathisers as a mechanism for investigation of the racial origins of caste. According to Crispin Bates, this \\"highly anecdotal book\\" was influenced by √âmile Senart's Les Castes dans L'Inde and Russell died when the SS Persia was torpedoed and sank off the coast of Crete on 30 December 1915.

The station is owned by Entercom. Most programming is provided by Boston sister station WEEI- FM. History The 105.5 MHz frequency used by WWEI was originally allocated to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where it signed on in October 1967 as WQRB-FM. It was co-owned with WBEC (1420 AM), though it offered its own programming; this was a middle-of-the-road format by 1972. The station became WBEC-FM in 1979, upon adopting an album-oriented rock format. During the 1980s, the station shifted to more of a contemporary hit radio format. Vox Media acquired the WBEC stations in 2002. Two years later, to accommodate then-sister station WNYQ (now WQBK-FM)'s move to Malta, New York, Vox filed to move WBEC-FM to Easthampton in 2004. Vox then put the station up for sale, and after an unsuccessful attempt to sell it to Pamal Broadcasting, it was sold to Entercom in 2006. WBEC-FM signed off from Pittsfield that May, with the format and call letters moving to 95.9 FM (a former frequency of WUPE-FM) at that time. The current incarnation of the station signed on as WVEI-FM from Easthampton on October 26. The call letters were changed to WWEI on September 14, 2011. On June 13, 2012 it was announced that WWEI would carry UMass Minutemen football and UMass Minutemen basketball games. In the event of conflicts with Boston Red Sox and Boston Celtics broadcasts, station manager David Oldread said \\"his station would prefer to keep UMass as the priority.\\" It is not known yet whether the Celtics or Sox games would air on WHYN (560 AM) during such conflicts. As part of the deal, every Thursday at 7pm, WWEI airs The Coaches Show hosted by UMass Football analyst Matt Goldstein (with interviews with head UMass Football coach and head UMass Basketball coach) over WEEI programming. Also, every Friday at 7pm during Springfield Falcons hockey season, WWEI airs The Old Time Hockey Show, which discusses the Falcons, the Boston Bruins, and the NHL. WWEI formerly carried Fox Sports Radio in the overnight hours, even after parent station WEEI switched to ESPN Radio in 2009; at that time, ESPN programming was heard in Springfield on WHLL. At midnight on January 1, 2013, WWEI assumed the ESPN Radio affiliation, after WHLL switched to CBS Sports Radio.

Houghton Park is bounded by Orange Avenue to the east, Atlantic Avenue to the west, Artesia Boulevard to the north, and Harding Street to the south.  History  Three acres of land for Houghton Park was donated on July 30, 1924 by Stanley W., Dove C., and Elizabeth P. Houghton, in memory of their father Col. Sherman Otis Houghton and his wife Eliza Donner Houghton, the orphaned daughter of the fateful Donner party that died in the show pack at Donner Lake in 1846. Col. Sherman Otis Houghton bought the 78-acre ranch in North Long Beach in 1896 that included the present Houghton Park and lived there from 1898 until his death in 1914. He was the first representative from Southern California in the U.S. Congress from 1871 to 1875. One more acre was donated by the real estate firm, Zimmerman and Dyer. The City of Long Beach then purchased 24.88 acres from the Houghton family on May 9, 1927. Palm trees planted by Stanley Houghton remain. The park's community recreation center now stands where the barn stood. There is no record for the construction of the original section of the community recreation center, called a clubhouse at that time. It included an auditorium style area with a stage and an adjoining kitchen. The evidence provided by the architectural style indicates that it was constructed in the 1930s. On June 25, 1947, the Park Commission approved the location of a canteen building in the northeast corner of the park. An old building was moved in and served until the park was redeveloped from 1959 to 1961. The clubhouse was expanded to include a canteen to serve the recreational interests of the boys and girls attending Jordan High School and the freestanding building removed. In 1973 a Neighborhood Facilities Center was built with federal grants and houses programs of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Council Field office. In 1987, the community recreation center was again expanded to add a senior citizen's center. This addition included three multi-purpose rooms and a reading room. The park includes three baseball diamonds, a soccer field overlay on the baseball diamonds and a separate soccer field, a playground, tennis courts, basketball courts, and a skate park built in 2004. Renovation of the baseball fields, playground, and sports field lights occurred with funding from the Los Angeles County Safe Neighborhood Parks Bond Acts of 1992 and 1996.\\"Parks & Open Space/Parks/Houghton Park\\", The City of Long Beach, Retrieved on 3 March 2015.

Groeningemuseum, Bruges. The Death of the Virgin is an oil on oak panel by the Flemish painter Hugo van der Goes. Completed c 1472‚Äì80, it shows the Virgin Mary on her deathbed surrounded by the Twelve Apostles. The scene is borrowed from Jacobus de Voragine's thirteenth-century \\"Legenda aurea\\"The Legenda aurea were translated to Dutch around that time as \\"Passionael\\" or \\"die gulden Legende\\" which relates how the apostles were brought, at Mary's request, on clouds by angels to a house near Mount Zion to be with her in her final three days.Campbell, 250 On the third day Jesus appeared above her bed in a halo of light surrounded by angels to accept her soul at the point when his name was finally mentioned.\\"The death of the Virgin \\". Rijksmuseum. Retrieved 14 September 2011. Three days later he reappeared to accept her body. History and description Death of the Virgin was almost certainly painted on commission and along with his Monforte and Portinari altarpieces is one of van der Goes most important works. It is likely one of his last paintings finished before he died. According to art historian Till-Holger Borchert, the panel \\"belongs to the most impressive and artistically mature achievements of Early Netherlandish painting\\". According to Lorne Campbell, the painting is van der Goes' \\"most idiosyncratic masterpiece\\".Campbell, 252 Mary is shown lying in a blue robe with a white headdress on a timber bed with her head resting on a white pillow against a headboard. Her skin is thin and pallid, her hands clasped in prayer. She is surrounded by the twelve apostles who crowd around her bed. Peter is dressed in the white robes of a priest and holds a candle which in the then contemporary ritual will be handed to the dying woman. Above her Christ appears in a halo of light, holding his arms open to receive Mary's soul,In some earlier depictions her soul is represented as a small child while his palms are open to display the wounds sustained at Calvary. With this gesture, Christ identifies himself as both redeemer and conqueror of death.Borcher, 161 The Death marks a break in van der Goes style; line has become more important, setting is eliminated and the image lacks depth and is tightly contracted with only the bed, door and the body of the Virgin giving spatial indicators.Koslow, Susan. \\"The Impact of the Modern Devotion on Hugo van der Goes's Death of the Virgin\\". College of Art Association of America, Washington D.C., 1978. Retrieved 14 September 2011. It is renowned for not showing the apostles either in the traditional idealised manner nor as conventional figure types, but instead representing each as a unique individual, displaying their grief through a range of expressions and gestures, from sorrow and despair, to empathy and compassion. Because the artist has not used traditional representation it is difficult to identify each apostle.Borcher, 161-2 c 1500 copy of the Berlin work attributed to the Master of the Amsterdam Death of the Virgin, a follower of van der Goes. Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam. The work is the best known and famous of one of a number of paintings after the death of Mary attributed to van der Goes or followers. Some art historians, including Friedrich Winkler (1964), believe he painted at least three versions, although it is generally accepted that preparatory sketches made for the Bruges work were later copied reproduced as paintings by late 15th century followers. Two similar paintings in the Berlin State Museums, the National Gallery, London, are attributed as \\"after van der Goes\\". They are usually thought to be later versions of a pen on paper drawing in the Herzog Anton Ulrich Museum, Brunswick, probably a copy of an original preparatory sketch by van der Goes. These works are similar to the Bruges paintings, but show the image in reverse.The London painting is likely in turn a copy again of the Berlin work. See Campbell, 250 Infra-red photography shows that the composition was planned a highly detailed manner before the underdrawing was applied. Art historian Lorne Campbell writes, \\"it is possible that the Brunswick drawing reflects one of his earliest ideas for the Bruges painting and that the Berlin, Prague and London pictures echo, however distantly, a later stage in his development of the Bruges composition.Campbell, 251 Martin Schongauer, The Death of the Virgin, engraving, early 1470s. The painting has been the subject of intense debate as to its date and meaning. Van der Goes spent the final years of his life submerged in depression. A number of art historians, including Max Friedl√§nder, view the work as painted c. 1480 when the artist first began to display signs of mental suffering and thus view it as an expression of his illness. The artist's late life‚Äîhe died in either 1482 or 1483‚Äîsusceptibility to depression and insanity was discovered in 1863 in a chronicle by his contemporary Gaspar Ofhuys, who recorded a night in 1480 when van der Goes began to excitedly talk about how he was a doomed, lost soul and attempted to commit suicide and had to be forcibly held down. This account greatly added to the painting's value in the eyes of late-19th-century painters. Vincent van Gogh mentions van der Goes three times in his letters, first in 1873 to his brother Theo, and on two more occasions when he wrote that he identified with the portrait of van der Goes in Emile Wauters's emotionally rendered 1872 painting Hugo van der Goes Undergoing Treatment at the Red Cloister. Art historian Erwin Panofsky described van der Goes as \\"the first artist to live up to a concept unknown to the Middle Ages but cherished by the European mind ever after, the concept of a genius both blessed and cursed with his diversity from ordinary human beings.\\" Panofsky goes on to describe how the work's flatness represents an \\"irrationality of space, light, colour, [the] expression of the artist's mental illness\\".Ridderbos, Bernhard. \\"Early Netherlandish paintings: rediscovery, reception and research\\". Los Angeles: Getty Publishing, 2005. 124. Other art historians, including Dirk de Vos and Susan Koslow, reject this thesis and argue that a wholly individualised conception of the scene would not have been acceptable to the painting's commissioners. In their view the pared down and contracted manner of the work is due to a desire to \\"stress the solemnity of the event and its miraculous nature, van der Goes may have decided that material richness would be distracting and indecorous.\\" Van der Goes was a highly progressive and original artist, but at the same time heavily influenced by both contemporary and predecessor artists. Inspiration for this work can be detected in Petrus Christus' c 1457‚Äì67 Death of the Virgin and by works attributed to the workshop of Rogier van der Weyden.Borcher, 162 The painting bears striking similarity to Martin Schongauer's c 1470‚Äì75 engraving of the same name, especially in its overall tone and mood, the depiction of Mary and the representation of the apostles seated to Mary's left. Yet there are significant differences; the bed in Schongauer's engraving is canopied and the distribution of the apostles is very different in the two works. The Schongauer is dated to at latest 1475, and it is a matter of significant and at times harsh and divisive critical debate as to which work came first (see above).

A figure of a horse is in inside the serpent at the top of the stone. The horse, which is clearly a stallion as indicated by the phallus, is depicted with crossed legs to indicate powerlessness. The combination of symbols of fertility and powerlessness on the horse may indicate regeneration or salvation. Several other Scandinavian runestones include depictions of horses, including DR 96 in √Ölum, N 61 in Alstad, S√∂ 101 in Ramsundsberget, S√∂ 239 in H√§ringe, S√∂ 327 in G√∂ksten, U 375 in Vidbo, U 488 in Harg, U 599 in Hanunda, U 691 in S√∂derby, U 855 in B√∂ksta, U 901 in H√•m√∂, U 935 at the Uppsala Cathedral, and U 1003 in Fr√∂tuna. The inscription on S√∂ 226 is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp, which is the classification for runic text bands with attached serpent or beast heads that are depicted as seen from above. The inscription based on stylistic analysis is attributed to a runemaster named Amunde, who signed inscriptions on the now-lost S√∂ 215 in Sorunda, S√∂ 223 in Trollsta, S√∂ 268 in S√∂derby, and the now-lost S√∂ 271 in T√§cker√•ker. The runic text states that the stone was raised by four men named Bj√¥rn, V√©bj√¥rn, Hrafni, and Ketilbj√¥rn in memory of their father Geirbj√¥rn. The names of three of the brothers share the common name element bj√¥rn, which is Old Norse for \\"bear,\\" with their father. A common practice at that time in Scandinavia was the repeating one of the name elements from a parent's name in the names of the children to show the family connection. p. 750. The missing portion of the damaged runic text was reconstructed as the words r√¶istu st√¶in or \\"raised the stone\\" based upon similar wording on other inscriptions.

The elevation of the community is . Its ZIP code is 29014. The Cornwell Inn, located on Blackstock Road, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.  Government  Blackstock is an unincorporated community. Accordingly, it has no municipal government. Certain portions of the community are located in Fairfield County, while others are located in Chester County. As a result, both counties exercise a measure of control over the affairs of the community and provide services to it.  History  Edward Blackstock, an early postmaster, gave the community his last name.  Attractions  A monument, dedicated to the slave Burrel Hemphill, can be found on the front grounds of Hopewell ARP Church.South Carolina Office of Tourism The monument consists of a small stone building with a placard that reads as follows: \\"In memory of Burrel Hemphill, killed by Union solders February 1865. Although a slave, he gave his life rather than betray a trust. He was a member of Hopewell.\\" One account of Hemphill's death states that he was tortured and killed by U.S. soldiers after refusing to disclose where his master had hidden certain valuables.Charles Kelley Barrow and J.H. Segars, Black Southerners in Confederate Armies: A Collection of Historical Accounts, Pelican Publishing Company (2007) The story of Burrel Hemphill's sacrifice has been the subject of historical programs led by Dr. W.T.

Posthumous pardon  On April 24, 1913, Confederate States of America veteran John Q. Lewis was murdered in Blackstock. An investigation of the murder led to the arrest, prosecution, and conviction of Thomas and Meeks Griffin - two African-American residents of the town. Doubts about the conviction inspired more than 150 residents of the town, including the mayor and a former sheriff of Chester County, to petition for governor of South Carolina to commute the sentences. The list of petitioners included \\"many white leaders of the community and ordinary white citizens.\\" However, the men were executed on September 29, 1915. Research demonstrating the inequity of the matter was presented to the parole board in 2009 and led the state to issue its first posthumous pardon in a capital murder case.

From 2011 until February 2014, the translator aired a smooth jazz format as \\"102.5 WLOQ,\\" when it was leased by iHeartMedia. History W273CA was previously a repeater of WPOZ in the Lake City area, but it was moved to Orlando. It was previously leased by Cox Radio (Cox Media Group), and Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia). =WLOQ Beautiful Music= From its lease from iHeartMedia in 2011 until February 2014, W273CA carried the smooth jazz format originally heard on 103.1 WLOQ. WLOQ was started by John T. Rutledge, who also owned 950 WLOF Orlando (now WORL). WLOQ went on the air in 1966, with the license held by the Carter Broadcasting Company.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-48 The station broadcast from a room at the Langford Hotel in Winter Park, Florida and the format was Beautiful Music, playing only instrumentals. The original format was designed by Rutledge who was very particular as to its adherence. The antenna was on a monopole on top of the hotel. All of the production, news and sales originated from the WLOF staff. Violet Jean Sidebottom was the manager of WLOQ and ran a tight ship. Rutledge appointed Jerry Reeves manager after Violet Sidebottom. The station is a Class A FM, licensed to Winter Park, stereo, dual-polarized antenna, with approximately 3000 watts of power. 103.1 WLOQ was sold along with 970 WLOF c. 1972 to the Home Security Life Insurance Company, owned by the Gross Family. The call sign was retained after the purchase. =A New Home for Smooth Jazz= In 1977, WLOQ began moving to a format it called \\"Good Music\\" which was a forerunner of the Smooth Jazz sound, combining jazz and pop music. The Smooth Jazz format continued until 2011. In 2011, after CEO John Gross retired for medical reasons, WLOQ was sold to TTB Media Corporation.\\"WLOQ sold because of CEO‚Äôs medical retirement\\" Orlando Business Journal, 2011-07-18. At midnight on August 1, WLOQ's smooth jazz format moved exclusively online to the website \\"WLOQ.com\\" (now defunct). The station on 103.1 changed its call letters to WHKQ (now WOTW), and began stunting with all Elvis Presley music as \\"Elvis 103.1.\\" On August 3 that year, the station switched to Spanish language Top 40 as \\"KQ103.\\"\\"103.1 WLOQ Orlando Sold; Now Stunting With Elvis\\" Lance Venta, radioinsight.com, 2011-08-01.

(formerly Clear Channel Communications).http://jazzchill.blogspot.com/2011/08/smooth-jazz-radio- returns-to-orlando.html The WLOQ sound was revived on translator station 102.5 W273CA in Orlando, fed by the HD-2 signal of co-owned 107.7 WMGF. The programming came from Broadcast Architecture's syndicated Smooth Jazz Network, except for a local morning show hosted by Erica Lee, formerly of crosstown Hot AC WOMX 105.1. Lee's show debuted on June 3, 2013.Erica Lee Joins WLOQ Orlando, RadioInsight.com, 06-03-2013. The new \\"102.5 WLOQ\\" was a moderate ratings success. The HD2 rebroadcast that was heard on the translator was in mono instead of stereo, in which the translator was licensed. =Switch to Talk= In February 2014, W273CA switched from \\"Smooth Jazz WLOQ\\" (which continues on 107.7 WMGF-HD2) to a simulcast of talk-formatted WFLF 540 AM.\\"Urban In, Smooth Jazz Out as Clear Channel Shuffles in Orlando,\\" Radio Insight, 12 February 2014. Retrieved 18 February 2014. WFLF was rebranded as \\"NewsRadio 102.5 WFLA,\\" using the translator's dial position rather than the AM station's frequency of 540 kHz. As of September 1, 2018, W273CA is no longer broadcasting WFLF (AM) due to the lease expiring for W273CA 102.5 FM between iHeartMedia and Central Florida Educational Association. The FM simulcast has since moved to W226BT on 93.1 FM. =Flip to Spanish Christian contemporary as \\"La Z 102.5\\"= On October 1, 2018, W273CA briefly stunted with a 1950s/60s oldies format for two days until the next day at 3:00 PM after the station ID, it began broadcasting a Spanish Christian music format as La Z 102.5, as a repeater of WPOZ-HD4. From September 3 to October 1, 2018, it still continued to broadcast WFLF's simulcast for unknown reasons even though the lease between iHeartMedia and Central Florida Educational Association expired. One listener noticed that they feared that WPOZ- HD4/W273CA was stunting with Los Lobos' version of \\"La Mamba\\", and the Spanish version of the ‚ÄúCool Oldies‚Äù liner the next day during the afternoon in overnight hours. Sometime in early-mid 2019, one of WPOZ's FM translators in Clermont switched from Christian-rock formatted \\"The Rock\\", and began simulcasting WPOZ-HD4 to extend the reach of \\"La Z\\".

He was a prominent participant in the Synod of Dort (1618‚Äì1619). His primary works were to counter Roman Catholic doctrine (especially that championed by Robert Bellarmine) and to oppose Socinianism and Arminianism. Life Lubbertus was born in Langwarden in 1555. He studied Divinity in Wittenberg in 1574 and in Geneva in 1576, where one of his professors was Theodore Beza. He also studied in Marburg in 1578 and at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe in 1580, where one of his teachers was Zacharias Ursinus. He earned his doctorate in theology on June 22, 1587 in Heidelberg under Daniel Tossanus. Around 1592 Hadrian √† Saravia, who had left the Netherlands for England, wrote in his De Gradibus complaining that the Netherlands' governmental pay of fixed stipends to ministers was far too small and \\"evidence that the church's officers were not shown the respect that was their due...he spoke of the 'misera conditio' of ministers in Holland. The government behaved towards them like an employer.\\" Saravia found that his local officials held that giving ministers too much money would make them \\"grow in respect and authority in the eyes of the people\\" and make them rivals of the burgomasters and sheriffs. Theodore Beza already under attack from Leiden professor, Carolus Gallus (who questioned his \\"views on election, creation, the relationship between church and state and church order\\") saw Saravia's work as a further attack on his Church. Beza wrote to Lubbertus in 1592 expecting support. Lubbertus did not come to the aid of Calvin's successor, feeling that as Saravia was in the Anglican Church that his views would not have the power of appeal in the Netherlands that Beza feared. In 1601 Lubbertus wrote against Robert Bellarmine in De conciliis libri quinque, Scholastice & Theologice collati cum disputationibus Roberti Bellarmini. Responsio ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii Lubbertus is best known for his opposition to the position of Hugo Grotius, who defended the right of the civil authority to place whomever they wished into university faculty. Lubbertus held that professor Conrad Vorstius' views were so far outside the norm of Calvinism that they may be considered irreligion. Lubbertus was the lead voice calling for Vorstius' removal. In order to gather international backing for their position, Lubbertus and Matthew Slade (a rector of the academy at Amsterdam, a member of the eldership in the English church at Amsterdam, and the son-in-law of Amsterdam minister Petrus Plancius) began a correspondence with English divines including George Abott, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Their outreach for support succeeded to the point that King James I of England became obsessed with the controversy. Ecclesiologically King James liked the Remonstrant Johannes Wtenbogaert's Tractaet van't ampt ende authoriteyt which held that the state held complete authority over the Church (a position James held in his controversy over the Oath of Allegiance with the Jesuits). It was due to the Oath controversy that King James had produced A Premonition to alle Most Mighty Monarchs, Kings, Free Princes, and States of Christendom in 1609 as \\"a warning against papal pretensions to worldly power\\". James also began a pamphlet campaign against the papacy, whom Bellarmine and Francisco Su√°rez defended. The Jesuit Martinus Becanus, native to the Netherlands, was also engaged in this pamphlet campaign. Becanus's Refutatio Apologiae linked King James with Vorstius, while declaring James' argument as resting on the heresies of Arianism or Macedonianism when James claimed that the Holy Spirit, and not Peter and his successors. is the vicar of Christ. In Becanus's Examen Plagae Regiae, he implied James' and Vorstius' opinions were the same and that they went beyond heresy into atheism. This infuriated James and made him desire to show his disdain to all things smacking of heterodoxy. Joining Lubbertus's cause against Vorstius, King James produced his own volume on the matter in 1612 entitled His Maiesties Declaration concerning His Proceedings with the States general of the United Provinces of the Low Countreys, In the cause of D. Conradus Vorstius. Lubbertus rose to the attention of the Dutch civil authorities who had sided with the Remonstrants with his publishing of a 900-page book Commentarii ad nonaginta errores Conradi Vorstii which opened with a dedicatory letter to George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the dedication he attacked the States of Holland and other authorities for appointing Vorstius to professor of Divinity at Leiden University and accused them of introducing Socianianism into the Dutch Church. In response to Lubbertus' work against Vorstius, Hugo Grotius (a representative for Rotterdam and the acting Judge Advocate of Holland) wrote Ordinum Pietas in 1613. This caustic polemic not only attacked Lubbertus' views but called him out in print (such as listing a number of quotations of Church Fathers and then saying \\"What are you going to reply to this mass of examples - Sibrandus?\\"). In Ordinum Pietas Grotius declared that Lubbertus' position against Vorstius was merely a smokescreen for him to discredit the States of Holland. Grotius attacked Lubbertus and the Counter-Remonstrants for resisting Vorstius' appointment as following anti-Melanchthonianism and abandoning hopes of unity. He declared that Lubbertus was upset with the States because of their toleration of the Remonstrants (and their Erastianistic opinions), thereby presenting all of Lubbertus' actions against Vorstius as motivated merely from frustration over the toleration shown to the Remonstrants by the States of Holland. Noting how Grotius had pulled outside elements into the debate over Vorstius, Festus Hommius wrote to Lubbertus on November 8, 1613 warning him that Grotius might have a hidden agenda behind linking these elements to the Vorstius case, \\"if Lubbertus reacts to everything, he will antagonize King James and the English bishops [who liked the Remonstrants view on State supremacy].\\" One of the people who incited Lubbertus to write a response to Grotius's Ordinum Pietas was Johannes Althusius (whom Grotius oddly claimed as influential in his own thought). In February 1614, Lubbertus, calling Ordinum pietas by Grotius \\"arrogantia\\", attacked its reasoning in Responsio Ad Pietatem Hugonis Grotii. Lubbertus and many of his fellow counter-remonstrants saw Grotius' multiple quotations and \\"display of academic erudition\\" as sophistry, though Grotius saw them as necessary to meet \\"thereby the scholarly expectations of his time.\\" Lubbertus disputed Grotius competence to consider religious matters since he was a legal expert rather than a trained theologian. Grotius often focused on issues of procedure in the early Church rather than theological content. Grotius had pointed out that the Anabaptists in Friesland were tolerated and Lubbertus and his supporters were not against toleration as a concept. Historian Hans W. Blom summarizes Lubbertus' view on tolerance, stating that he held one must accept toleration \\"because a person cannot be forced to believe against his own convictions, and...because there are times and circumstances that make tolerance a matter of practical necessity. ...[but this] did not include the freedom to make thoughts public. The public sermon leaves no room for heterodoxy. One cannot be a heretic with heretics and at the same time recognized by the orthodox as orthodox.\\" Lubbertus accused Vorstius of using deceit to attain a position with the appearance of orthodoxy in order to covertly slip heretical works and ideas into his lesson plans. Lubbertus called Grotius's selection of quotes from Church Fathers \\"unfortunate\\", joining Johannes Bogerman (another Ordinum pietas critic who wrote against it in his Annotationes) in feeling Grotius was disregarding the original context of the quotations to apply them to the current controversy. Lubbertus did not use as many sources as his opponent in his response to Grotius, basing his arguments \\"mainly on a collection of the acts of councils and a number of quotations of Augustine, and using Stephanus' Thesaurus for broader ancient material\\". In response to Lubbertus' book, Grotius anonymously published Bona Fides Sibrandi Lubberti in late 1614. Later life Lubbertus was married to Truicken van Oosterzee (c. 1550-1625). He died in Franeker on January 10, 1625.

The principal filmmaker was photographer Herbert Ponting. Originally a silent film, the documentary was restored and re-released in 2011 by the British Film Institute with a musical soundtrack by Simon Fisher Turner. Synopsis and production notes The Terra Nova Expedition was an effort, by governments and concerned citizens of what was then the British Empire, to plant the Union Jack on the South Pole by means of men, ponies, dogs, and primitive snowmobiles hauling sledges from a base located on the Antarctic coastline. The documentary portrays expedition leader Robert Falcon Scott and his ship, the Terra Nova, and men as they leave Lyttelton, New Zealand, to sail into the Southern Ocean and its ice floes. Safely landed on the icy coastline of Ross Island, the filmmaker follows the men as they set up tents, practice skiing, and prepare to probe southward toward the Pole. The film concludes with a sequence of the explorers pushing off from their base, and title cards reminding viewers of what, to the 1924 viewer, would have been the familiar story of the expedition's tragic conclusion. Scott and his immediate support group of four companions never returned from the Pole. =Pioneering cinematographer= The Great White Silence's director/cinematographer, Herbert Ponting Filmmaker Herbert Ponting was the first known photographer to bring a cinematograph to the Antarctic continent and to take brief film sequences of the continent's killer whales, Ad√©lie penguins, south polar skuas, Weddell seals and other fauna, as well as the human explorers who were trying to \\"conquer\\" it. Scott did not choose cinematographer Ponting to accompany him to the South Pole. Ponting remained on base and survived with his film sequences, eventually returning to England. Reception The Great White Silence, and a successor film with a soundtrack based upon some of the same film sequences, 90¬∞ South, were not great commercial successes, and Ponting, the director, died impoverished. However, his work was eventually acclaimed as one of the highest-quality group of images surviving from the so-called Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration, and The Great White Silence was unearthed, restored, and re-released in 2011. Reviews of the re-release were significantly positive. Marc Lee of The Daily Telegraph called the film \\"deeply moving\\" and \\"startlingly powerful\\". Cath Clarke of The Guardian gave the film four stars out of five and lauded the \\"beautiful\\" restoration work done by the BFI. Sean Axmaker of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, reporting from the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, gave the film a glowing review. \\"An impressive documentary and a riveting document\\", he praised the \\"beautiful still photographs\\", \\"eloquent\\" titles and Ponting's \\"slow build of trials, disasters and deaths\\" for being \\"respectful and affecting\\".

Series premier at the Polish TV station Kino Polska and is currently airing at TVP ABC and JimJam. Outside of Poland the series also aired on Argentina's TV Pakapaka (the show is known in Argentina as Hip Hip Hurra), Romania, Portugal and Italy. The cast included Grzegorz Kwiecie≈Ñ, Krzysztof Szczerbi≈Ñski, Joanna Pach and a famous Polish celebrity actor Jaros≈Çaw Boberek as the voices for various secondary characters, most notably Peacock and Hummingbird. Most episodes where written by El≈ºbieta WƒÖsik, Maciej Kur and Marcin Graj (who also voice Hip-Hip in the second season)  Overview  The show is set in a world of talking animals who try to live like humans. The stories focus on the adventures of a detective duo; Hip-Hip (a pink hippopotamus) and his assistant Hurrah (a purple weasel). The names Hip-Hip and Hurrah may stem from the common English expression: hip hip hooray. In each episode the heroes try to solve a mystery that usually concludes with an environmental message for the children, such as how rainbow is created, how children are born, how the flowers feed, where do clouds come from, or simply with habits and nature of particular animals. One episode deals with optical perspective. All animal characters on the show appear to operate by very silly logic (similar to that of Winnie-the-Pooh) and are usually puzzled by the most basic phenomena. While the series is intended for very young children, it often includes humor intended for adults as well. The series consists of 26 episodes. The style of animation is simple but very artistic. Many episodes have a subplot that is unrelated to the main mystery. Other episodes have twists on the usual formula - for example in one episode Hip-Hip and Hurra solve the mystery behind a series of crimes early on (as a meta-joke even the end credits start rolling). However the thief, who turns out to be a magpie, claims she is not responsible for the crimes she committed, and the animals put her on a trial with Hip-Hip as the judge. In the end they all learn that the magpie's actions (stealing shiny objects) were strictly motivated by her instincts so she can't be punished for her \\"crimes\\".  Characters  *Hip-Hip (\\"Hip\\" for short) - the main hero, a detective. He is somewhat competent and clumsy at the same time. He has a big crush on Rose but is usually incredibly shy about it. He is bold, fat and eats a lot. He considers himself a master of disguise but they often don't work as well as he was hoping. Most animals in town consider him an authority figure because of all the cases he has solved. He also has a twin sister named Hopla. *Hurra - Hip-Hip's assistant, a purple, energetic weasel. While often clueless and a bit wacky he usually tries his best to help Hip-Hip solve the mystery. While Hip-Hip usually gets annoyed with him they appear to bond pretty well. Unlike Hip, Hurra isn't shy when it comes to romance. *Rose the Giraffe - Hip's next door neighbor who speaks with a French accent. She is very kind and is a professional painter (she paints with her tail). She's very popular artist as all animals in town appear to be fans of her art. She's Hip-Hip's love interest and appears to have some admiration for him as well. She also work as a nurse. *Auntie Hen - Hip's landlady. She sometimes serve as the voice of wisdom. * Misia (Missy) - An ant who lives in Hip-Hip's front packet and is his apprentice. She assist the heroes in some adventures, usually serving as a spy. Despite her ambition she is very lazy and falls asleep very easily. *Peacock - narcissistic and obsessed with his tail (which makes an umbrella-like sound each time it opens). He works at the local TV station \\"ƒÜwir TV\\" (\\"Tweet TV\\") and is a big celebrity in town. *Kinga - an attractive mail lady kangaroo and Hurra's girlfriend. She is sweet but very eccentric. Despite of being an adult she lives with her imaginary friend, a flower named Adelka, and usually spends her free time entertaining her. *Hummingbird - small but aggressive wise guy with an over the top groveling voice which is parody of Polish actor Witold Pyrkosz. *The Bear Family - A family of brown bears (depicted as stereotypical people from Praga) who appear once in a while as comedic relief. The family consist of Mr. Bear, his wife and, an adult son referred to as \\"Synek\\" (\\"Sonny Boy\\") as well three cousins: a polar bear, a sloth bear (who's a dancer from India) and a panda from China. *Crane - A bank owner and Hip's friend. He panics a lot and easily gets paranoid. *Gorilla - Another of Hip's friends who loves to drive his scooter. He has a wife and a small child who was born in episode 6. *Squirrel - She loves to gossip, spread rumors and is often seen spying to see what other animals are doing in their houses.

It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Little Rock. The property is located at the corner of South Louisiana Street and West 7th Street in downtown Little Rock. History The Rev. Peter Donnelly from the Diocese of St. Louis celebrated the first Mass in Little Rock in a room over Dugan's Store at 2nd and Main Streets in 1830. As the congregation grew they acquired a building for their use on East Markham near Third Street. The Rev. Joseph Richard Bole and Father Paris were sent to Little Rock to build a permanent church building in 1839 on the property where the Arcade Building was located on Louisiana between Sixth and Seventh Streets. Known as the Old French Church, it was dedicated by Bishop Mathias Loras of the Diocese of Dubuque, Iowa in 1841. The Diocese of Little Rock was established by Pope Gregory XVI on November 28, 1843 with the Most Rev. Andrew Byrne as the first bishop. Bishop Byrne established the first St. Andrew's Cathedral at Second and Center Streets in 1845. As the congregation grew a new cathedral was needed. The cornerstone for the present cathedral was laid by Bishop Edward Fitzgerald on July 7, 1878. The church was dedicated on November 27, 1881. It was designed by Little Rock architect Thomas Harding and cost $470,000 to build. The tallest tower on the fa√ßade of the building was completed in 1887. A tornado struck downtown Little Rock in 1950 and toppled the cross on top of the tower. It also destroyed two of the stained glass windows. The present rectory was built in 1966. St. Andrew's Cathedral was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Architecture The Cathedral of St. Andrew is a Gothic Revival style structure that was built of native granite. The church measures in length and its nave is wide. The fa√ßade features two towers, the tallest of which is crowned with a spire and rises above the ground. The interior is finished in Southern yellow pine and features a marble high altar that is decorated with onyx and other precious stones.

It is a fully manageable corporate Windows environment. The development of Windows To Go was discontinued by Microsoft in 2019, and is no longer available in Windows 10 as of the May 2020 update (version 2004). It is intended to allow enterprise administrators to provide users with an imaged version of Windows that reflects the corporate desktop. Although creation of Windows To Go drives is not officially supported by non-Enterprise (or Education) editions of Windows 8.x and 10, some information has been published describing various ways to install Windows To Go using any edition of Windows 8.x and 10 and any bootable USB device. History Before Windows 8, only embedded versions of Windows, such as Windows Embedded Standard 7, supported booting from USB storage devices. In April 2011, after the leak of Windows 8 build 7850, some users noticed that those builds included a program called \\"Portable Workspace Creator\\", indicating it was intended to create bootable USB drives of Windows 8. In September 2011, Microsoft officially announced Windows To Go at the Build conference, and distributed bootable 32 GB USB flash drives with Windows To Go pre-installed.  Differences from standard installation  Windows To Go has several significant differences compared to a standard installation of Windows 8 on a non-removable storage (such as hard disk drives or solid-state drives). ;Drive removal detection: As a safety measure designed to prevent data loss, Windows pauses the entire system if the USB drive is removed, and resumes operation immediately when the drive is inserted within 60 seconds of removal. If the drive is not inserted in that time-frame, the computer shuts down to prevent possible confidential or sensitive information being displayed on the screen or stored in RAM. It is also possible to encrypt a Windows To Go drive using BitLocker. ;Driver configuration: The first time Windows To Go boots on a particular computer, it installs the drivers for that particular hardware and multiple reboots may be required.

This can be changed by policy (OfflineInternal). Hardware considerations Windows To Go works with USB 2.0 and faster USB connections, and both on legacy BIOS and UEFI firmware.Create Windows 10 To Go USB . Not all USB drives can be used in this environment; Microsoft has set specific requirements that the USB drive must meet in order to be a supported device. As of June 2017, there are 12 USB devices listed as supported by Microsoft for Windows To Go. When using a PC as a host, only hardware certified for use with either Windows 7 or Windows 8 will work well with Windows To Go. Although Microsoft does not provide support for this feature on Windows RT or Macintosh computers, it is possible to boot Windows To Go on a Mac. Licensing With a new companion device license from Microsoft Software Assurance, employees can use Windows To Go on any Software Assurance licensed computer as well as their home PC. Reception Simon Bisson, writing for ZDNet, called Windows To Go \\"One of the more interesting features of Windows 8\\", noting \\"Even though we were using a USB 2.0 port performance was good, with no noticeable lag\\" and calling it \\"a very useful way of running of Windows 8\\". Michael S. Lasky, writing for laptopmag.com, wrote \\"For IT departments that want to ensure that employees can safely access a corporate network, Windows To Go USB drives are incredibly convenient. Having the ability to instantly remake any Windows PC into your own secure, personal computer is a worthwhile and productive time-saver.\\" Discontinuation After the release of the May 2019 update (version 1903) for Windows 10, Microsoft announced that Windows To Go was no longer being developed, \\"Windows 10 features no longer being developed\\" as the feature did not support OS major feature updates and therefore did not enable the user to stay current. The specific certified type of performant USB media that was needed for this feature to provide a good user experience was also no longer being produced by their OEMs. Windows To Go has been removed in Windows 10 starting with the May 2020 update (version 2004).

The park includes hiking trails, primitive RV and tent campsites, and a day use area for hikers and bicyclists. History The park is located on the Middle Fork John Day River, on the site of a lumber mill that closed in 1975. The company town for the mill, Bates, formerly had a population of about 400 on the site, but when the mill closed, the town slowly depopulated. The mill pond, one of the few remaining landmarks from the lumber mill era, is a central feature of the new park. In 2008, the Oregon Parks and Recreation Department purchased the property from the county for $407,000 and spent another $900,000 in preparing the park for its opening in September 2011. Several matching grants were used to continue to develop and maintain the park. Features Located in the Blue Mountains, Bates State Park sits at above sea-level. The park contains 28 primitive campsites for tents and RVs. In addition, there is a day use area for hikers and bicyclists, who use the area as part of the TransAmerica bicycle trail. The day use area contains locations for picnicking and several miles of hiking trails are available. Interpretive panels describing the history of the town and the mill era are on display. The park is open from May to October.

His published fiction includes A Wind Is Rising, Plastic Jesus, What Death Can Touch, Skagit, Shenandoah and La Posada, Other Stories and Poems.https://www.amazon.com/Robert-Miskimon/e/B001KJ0Q7W Fictional themes include environmental and political struggles, man's search for a spiritual home and the artist's journey toward truth and awareness.  Personal life  He was born in Richmond, Virginia and lives on Vashon Island, Washington.  Written work  = Novels = Miskimon was part of a movement in San Francisco to establish an alternative book publishing outlet for West Coast authors in the 1970s with publication of his first novel, A Wind Is Rising, in 1976 by Anthelion Press of San Francisco.https://www.amazon.com/reader/0546899218?_encoding=UTF8&query;=Robert%20Miskimon#reader_0546899218 It is the story of a small community on the California coast that galvanizes to defeat a huge commercial development proposed by out-of-state interests. In a 1976 review of A Wind Is Rising, the Monterey Peninsula Herald said \\"the novel is well-constructed [and] should appeal to the general reader, but particularly to Peninsulans because of the transparency of the author's disguise of several Carmel residents.\\" The San Francisco Review of BooksVol. 3, No.5, Sept. 1977 said \\"confrontations between the Carmelites and their adversaries make for some powerful dramatic moments. There are some interesting ruminations, too, about the connection between the identity of one's community and one's self.\\" Plastic Jesus (Barnes & Noble/iUniverse, 2000) depicts the artistic and spiritual crisis of a writer as he drives from the West Coast to the East Coast; the picaresque novel includes numerous encounters with locals that help refine his sensibilities. What Death Can Touch (Random House/Xlibris, 2000) is the story of the death of a young child and its effects on immediate family, friends and community. La Posada, Other Stories and Poems (Random House/Xlibnris, 2001) is a collection of short stories that offers a taste of life out of the mainstream of America. Skagit (Barnes & Noble/iUniverse, 2002) is the story of residents of the fictional Skagit Island in Puget Sound who, despite their many differences and idiosyncrasies, unite to crush a proposed bridge from their island to the mainland. Midwest Book Review said in a 2007 citation: \\"Robert Miskimon's Skagit is a compelling novel about the people who reside on a small island in the Pacific Northwest. When a proposal to bridge their island to the mainland threatens the integrity of their refuge, the men and women of Skagit form their own community government on the island - yet the exploitation and greed that some humans resist and all humans share is not so easy to keep out. Skagit is recommended as a rewarding read examining the dual sides of human nature.\\"http://www.midwestbookreview.com Miskimon told Contemporary Authors: \\"My primary motivation for writing is to bridge the terrible chasm of loneliness that separates all of us from each other. I believe all great literature achieves this by providing the reader with a link to our common humanity and suffering, from which the hope, humor and grace that sustain us can grow.\\"https://www.amazon.com/Biography-Miskimon-Robert-Contemporary- Authors/dp/B0007SIYEO/ref=sr_1_8?s=books&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1335627659&sr;=1-8 His nonfiction books include The Complete Guide to Building Your Own Tree House (Atlantic Publishing Company, 2009) and Uncovered: the Bare Facts about Nude Recreation (Amazon Kindle, 2007).

Copulatory vocalizations usually occur during copulation and are hence related to sexual activity. Vocalizations that occur before intercourse, for the purpose of attracting mates, are known as mating calls. In primates, copulation calling is typically observed at the end of mating and there are vast variations between species regarding its occurrence, frequency and form. It is agreed that coital vocalizations fulfill an evolutionary purpose and that they serve as adaptive solutions to problems that the females face, such as infanticide, as well as obtaining high quality sperm. In non- primates, copulatory calling predominantly occurs before copulation in order to attract mates (mating call). Calls vary in frequency (14 Hz to 70,000 Hz) and function. One of the main purposes of females vocalizing is the induction of mate guarding behavior in males. Conversely, calls may also be used in order to attract high ranking mates who can prevent intercourse with the initial partner. This is done to incite male mate competition. In humans, coital vocalizations are linked to orgasm,Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, ‚Äò‚ÄôSex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships‚Äô‚Äô (Harper Perennial, 2011), pp. 255-57. hence occurring during copulation and serving as an expression of sexual pleasure. Vocalizations can be used intentionally by women in order to boost the self-esteem of their partner and to cause quicker ejaculation. In non-human primates =Occurrence, frequency and form= pitch being represented on the y-axis. In non-human primates, copulatory vocalizations begin towards the end of the copulatory act or even after copulation. The percentage of vocalizations after copulation varies dependent on the non-human primate species studied. In long-tail macaques, for instance, 80% of copulations are followed by copulation calls. In contrast, the percentage for chimpanzees and Tonkean macaques has been found to be 78.8% and 6%, respectively. There is little consensus on what causes these inter-specific differences, given the lack of consistent findings within the literature. The typical quantity of specimen that are tested in experimental settings is often too low in order to allow any general conclusions about the species as a whole. Another aspect of coital vocalization that varies according to species is the form of the call: in macaques and baboons they manifest themselves as grunts, whereas other species such as talapoins and chimpanzees typically emit screaming sounds. The quality and structure of copulatory calls are analyzed by comparing their respective spectrograms in terms of their frequency. Accordingly, some species produce calls that are structurally more complex than that of others. This is linked to the amount of promiscuity exhibited, in a way that more promiscuous species emit more faceted calls in order to convey more information about themselves and hence render self-advertisement more efficient. =Adaptive function= A male Chacma baboon shows aggression towards a female and her offspring.Copulatory calls in primates serve an adaptive function and are sexually selected. Calling signals sexual receptivity of the female and therefore affects mate choice. There are many different hypotheses as to the exact adaptive function of female copulatory calls in primates and research on the subject is still in its early stages. There is general agreement that copulatory calls are the adaptive solution to problems with reproductive success. In other words, copulatory vocalizations address issues that stand in the way of successfully producing offspring and guaranteeing its survival, such as the occurrence of infanticide. To prevent the killing of their offspring, female baboons employ copulatory calls in order to attract other males, allowing multiple mating acts and creating parental confusion among the males involved. The resulting uncertainty of who the father is hence reduces the occurrence of attacks, given the newly incited risk of potentially harming their own offspring. Additionally, mating in rapid successions also entails sperm competition, and therefore fulfills the additional function of obtaining high quality sperm. This is especially important in species that do not openly advertise good genes via honest signals. By attracting other males through post-copulatory calls, the female might provoke mate guarding behavior in their initial mate. This 'parental concentration', has two outcomes. Firstly, the male might be of high quality, allowing him to fend off those that were attracted by the call. In that case the female has not only gained someone who can protect her and who prevents infanticide through other males, but this also means that she was inseminated by a specimen with potentially good genes. Secondly, if the male fails to successfully guard her, she will mate with the newly arrived males, hence inciting sperm competition and paternity confusion (again preventing attacks on her offspring, as well as increasing her likelihood of obtaining high quality sperm). The calls produced by the female also carry information about the status of the male with whom she was copulating, thus allowing her to influence the likelihood of other males approaching. Accordingly, copulatory calls serve more than a single adaptive function. There is no mutual exclusivity when it comes to addressing the two problems described, namely that of infanticide and receiving high quality sperm. However, by taking the female's cycle stage into account, sperm competition can be ruled out as the primary underlying cause of copulatory calling. More precisely, females produce coital vocalizations also when they mate during non-fertile periods, which is therefore primarily aimed at attracting as many males as possible and to create parental confusion rather than obtaining high quality sperm. Females have no interest in advertising their periods of fertility, given that males would pick up on these patterns, reducing paternal confusion and causing an increase in aggressive behavior towards her offspring from other males. Such hidden fertility has been coined concealed ovulation, and is part of extended female sexuality. = Alternative benefits = In addition to the incitement of parental confusion in order to avoid infanticide, female primates that exhibit promiscuous behavior also reap non-genetic material benefits. A female that uses vocalizations after copulating with her mate attracts other males, with whom she is also likely to engage in multiple acts of mating. As a consequence male mates provide non- genetic benefits, such as food, to the female they mated with. Such vocalization-facilitated promiscuity heightens the female's reproductive success. The strategy to mate with multiple partners in order to obtain material benefits can equally be observed in non-primates.  In non-primates  = Occurrence = In addition to emitting copulatory vocalizations during and after copulation (as it is mostly seen in primates), non-primate species also vocalize before engaging in mating. Vocalizations that are made prior to copulation are named mating calls. They serve as a means to advertise sexual receptivity and are predominantly used by males to attract female mates. In general, non-primates emit more calls before copulating, as exemplified by the croaks of male frogs and the melodic tweeting of song sparrows. = Properties = Elephant copulation. In regard to the calling properties, frequency analysis is typically used in research to look at the complexity of the vocalization and to distinguish between calls, which is important in determining their function. Large frequency variations have been noted between species, ranging from 14 Hz to 70,000 Hz. Mice, for instance, use 70,000 Hz calls continuously prior to copulation. They then lower the frequency down to 40,000 Hz during the copulatory act, therefore two qualitatively different calls are used for attracting mates as compared to the actual act of mating. Most of the calling in mice is done by males. They use these ultrasonic calls (> 20,000 Hz and hence not discernible by the human ear) to attract females, with the quantity of calls being related to the male's mating success, making these vocalizations a sexually selected trait. On the other end of the spectrum, female African elephants use very low frequency calls of 14‚Äì35 Hz prior to, as well as during, copulation. Due to their low frequency these calls can be heard for several kilometers and are therefore effective in signalling receptivity. The vocalizations of female elephants are also used in order to incite mate guarding behavior in the male, which manifests itself in the form of fighting off any newly arriving mates. Not only females make use of this, as male Columbian ground squirrels have been observed to use copulatory vocalizations in order to announce their post-copulatory mate guarding to others. In addition to being used to retain the mate via mate guarding induction, female copulatory vocalizations can also be employed to achieve his departure. Red junglefowls, for instance, utilize calls in order to prevent or end unwanted copulations by attracting another high-ranking male fowl. Further effects of female calling on male's behavior are illustrated by spiders that have been shown to stridulate before copulation to inform males of sexual receptivity as well as during intercourse in order to influence male genitalic movements. Moreover, attracting new mates by calling out during copulation can entail many benefits for the female. Female crickets which mate with multiple partners receive a greater number of nuptial gifts, causing them to lay a larger quantity of eggs, hence increasing their reproductive success. In humans Theories are more diverse in regard to women‚Äôs sexual vocalizing. On one hand, researchers have noted some apparently communicative patterns in women‚Äôs copulatory vocalizations that suggest some parallels with those of other primates (including an invitation to sperm competition, given that female sexual vocalizations, like those of other primates, serve as \\"copulation calls\\" noticeable to other men and exciting to them if overheard). One study, for instance, has noted that female sexual vocalizations tend to become more intense as she approaches orgasm. At orgasm her vocalizations are usually discrete and are not random, appearing related to observed contractions of the superficial perivaginal striated muscles; these in turn probably correlate with each wave of erotic pleasure. The vocalization tends to become very rapid, with a regular rhythm that includes equal note lengths and intervals between notes, which male vocalization typically lacks. This is especially frequent when her orgasm occurs during penile-vaginal intercourse. By exciting her partner with her vocalizations and bringing about his orgasm at that point, she helps ensure that the seminal pool is available for her cervix to dip into as her vagina relaxes after her orgasm. Copulatory vocalizations may also be a type of mate retention behaviour. One study found that women who perceived a high risk of infidelity in their relationship were more likely to utilize copulatory vocalizations in order to fake an orgasm, along with other mate retention behaviours. On the other hand, recent studies have indicated that most copulatory vocalizations in women do not accompany their own orgasm, but rather their partner‚Äôs ejaculation. The study showed that the man typically finds the woman‚Äôs vocalization arousing and highly exciting, and that the woman herself is aware of this. Most women in the study, furthermore, indicated that they vocalized during intercourse to make their man ejaculate more quickly, or to boost his enjoyment or self-esteem, or both. A correlation has been found between the frequency of vocalizations and sexual satisfaction for both men and women. The reasons that women gave for wanting to force a quick ejaculation include the alleviation of the female's pain, fatigue, or even boredom, or simply to stay within some imposed time restriction for sexual activity. Reasons for wanting to boost the male self- esteem included reinforcing the pair bond that intercourse helps to strengthen, and thus reducing emotional and sexual infidelity and abandonment. The researchers note that all of these goals are apparently congruent with female copulatory vocalizations in non-human primates.

It was bought in 1950 by Henry McGill, one of the leading philanthropists in Charlotte. His wife Helen began planting roses to soften the grim heritage of the coal yard and, little by little, she transformed the former industrial site into a beautiful garden. Starting in 1967 the garden was opened to the public on every Mother‚Äôs Day. Eventually there were so many roses that Helen became known as the rose lady. When she died in 1985, her husband Henry took over the development and maintenance of the garden in her memory. On May 10, 1976, with the help of a federal grant which enabled Charlotte to acquire \\"green space\\", at the recommendation of Councilman Harvey Gantt, and with the approval by Mayor John M. Belk, the City purchased the property from Henry McGill. In 1995, an independent Board of Directors was formed for the garden, being recognized as a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. In 1996, the McGill Board entered into a lease with the City of Charlotte to manage the Garden, and continues to do so.

As of March 2020, a total of 55 potentially habitable exoplanets have been found. Of those, one is believed to be Sub-terran (Mars-size), 20 Terran (Earth-size) and 34 Super Terran (Super Earths). The most potentially habitable exoplanet discovered so far is Teegarden b, with an Earth Similarity Index of 0.93. The main feature of potentially habitable exoplanets is that they have to be located in the habitable zone of their stellar systems.  Characteristics  = Mass = In order to be potentially habitable, an exoplanet would have to have a mass between 0.1 and 10 Earth masses. = Radius = The radius of a habitable exoplanet would range between 0.5 and 2.5 Earth radii. = Temperature = The temperature among the habitable exoplanets discovered so far range from 182 degrees Kelvin (Kepler 186 f) and 285 degrees Kelvin (Tau Ceti e).  Host star  It is believed that F, G, K and M-type star could host habitable exoplanets. G-type stars would allow to host the exoplanets most similar to Earth, that is, Earth-like planets. K-type stars would provide the necessary conditions for super habitable exoplanets, which are exoplanets that could be more habitable than Earth. As of March 2020, only one potentially habitable exoplanet has been found orbiting a F-type star: Kepler-1632 b. M-type stars also considered possible hosts of habitable exoplanets, even those with flares such as Proxima b.

January - March 2011 *January 12:- At least 17 people were killed and more than 20 others injured, after a suicide car-bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a heavily fortified police station in the Bannu district, of north-western Pakistan. It was later confirmed, presumably by eyewitnesses that a Toyota Stout had apparently been used to conduct this suicide attack upon the Merian police station. There were also witness reports who had claimed that parts of the building to this police station, as well as a nearby mosque inside the compound were known to have collapsed due to the force of this suicide car bomb explosion. Witnesses reportedly stated that the sheer force of this suicide car-bomb explosion apparently also plunged the local area into darkness, as the blast damaged electricity lines within this area of the district. It was also established that the car bomber had specifically targeted the outer wall of the police station, which was consequently based within a densely populated area of the district. Reports have suggested that more than 50 police officers were inside the police complex at the time of this suicide attack, with local reports suggesting that all those killed were Frontier Corps officials, who act as a federal paramilitary police force within the country. This particular police station that was targeted, is known to be based near to the Janikhel tribal area, which is known to act as a buffer zone to the militancy-infested North Waziristan tribal region of north- western Pakistan. This suicide car bombing occurred as U.S. Vice-President, Joe Biden arrived in Islamabad whilst denying that the United States had imposed a war on terror on Pakistan. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan later claimed responsibility for this suicide car-bomb attack, whilst threatening that such attacks would continue, unless drone attacks were halted against their Al Qaeda and Pakistani Taliban affiliated militant networks and sanctuaries, located most especially within the highly volatile North Waziristan tribal region, which is located on the Afghan-Pakistan border, of north-western Pakistan.\\"Pakistani bomber kills 17 in attack on police\\" BBC News, January 12, 2011 *25 January At least thirteen people are killed while 70 others injured in a suicide bomb explosion in a mourning procession of Hazrat Imam Hussain near its concluding point at Kerbala Gamay Shah at Bhat Gate in Lahore and few minutes after Lahore blast, A suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden motorbike into a police van at Malir 15 area of Karachi, killing at least three people while 5 people were injured. *2 March Pakistan minister Shahbaz Bhatti shot dead in Islamabad *1 March At least three people were killed and one was wounded in two bomb blasts in Mohmand tribal region's Saafi tehsilhttp://dawn.com/2011/03/01/blast-kills-two-in-mohmand/ *8 March A car-bomb at a compressed natural gas filling station in Faisalabad on Tuesday killed 20 people and wounded more than 100, Regional Police Officer (RPO) Faisalabad, Aftab Cheema said.

Most states will have a representative speaking about issues concerning their country and the hopes for the coming year as to what the UNGA will do. This is as opportunity for the member states to opine on international issues of their concern.United Nations General Assembly opens on 13 September 2011. United Nations Department of Public Information. August 2011 Some heads of state, other government leaders or permanent representatives to the UN (or other members of national delegations at the UN) are scheduled to speak. The speeches would occur on 21, 22, 23, 24, 26 and 27 September in the General Assembly Chamber. (the biggest chamber at the United Nations building) President al-Nasser said that he would propose the theme for the debate as \\"the role of mediation in the settlement of disputes by peaceful means,\\" in order to enhance cooperation on one of the United Nations' founding ethos that he said also affects the UN's \\"existence...integrity, legitimacy, survival and effectiveness.\\". The theme is traditionally chosen by the President of the General Assembly, who proposes a theme of global relevant to the member states; in turn, the member states then approve of the matter and comment on it during the general debate. Additionally, member states would comment on issues of individual national and wider international relevance. Agenda The broader preliminary agenda for the session is: *The promotion of sustained economic growth and development in accord with the relevant resolutions fromh the General Assembly as well as other newer United Nations conferences. *The general maintenance of international peace and security. *Development in Africa. *The promotion of human rights. *Coordination for effective humanitarian assistance efforts. *The general promotion of justice and international law. *The continuation of disarmament initiatives. *The continuation of drug control efforts, crime prevention and the fight against \\"international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\\" *Other United Nations organisational, administrative and related matters. On 26 June 2012, al-Nasser presided over a thematic debate on drugs, crime and development, including the overlapping of each facet. ;Supplementary items *Appointment of observer status for the Central European Initiative (as proposed by Italy, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine). *Appointment of observer status for United Cities and Local Governments (as proposed by Turkey). *Appointment of observer status for the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (as proposed by Ethiopia). *Financing for the United Nations Interim Security Force for Abyei (as proposed by Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon). *Financing for the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (as proposed by Secretary-General Ban ki-Moon). *Appointment of observer status for the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic- speaking Countries (as proposed by Azerbaijan). *Promotion of a people's empowerment and a peace-centric development model (as proposed by Bangladesh). *Appointment of observer status for the International Conference of Asian Political Parties (as proposed by Cambodia, Japan, Nepal, the Philippines, South Korea and Vietnam). =Recognition of Palestine= An UNGA vote on recognition for the state of Palestine is expected at the end of September.The UN General Assembly vote on Palestine due soon: Voice of Russia. :. Retrieved on 27 September 2011. Expectations for an approval by a large majority are high. The wording of the resolution by the Fatah movement was crafted in such a way as to bring states doubtful of a vote to either support it or at least abstain. The draft does not state a recognition of Palestine under the 1967 borders, but instead asks for permanent borders to be negotiated based on the principle of the 4 June 1967; a move that even elicited the support of some members of the rival Palestinian movement Hamas, who has previously said that recognition of the 1967 borders before a final-status deal would mean waiving the claim for the right of return of refugees. On 15 September, a senior Palestinian diplomat said that \\"we will make the final decision soon\\" when disputed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas \\"announce[s] the final decision.\\" At the same time Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian permanent observer to the United Nations, reiterated the same statement in saying how the Palestinian would go forward with the move. \\"We have the right to join the international community as a full member...This campaign has this symbolic gesture of a chair, a set of Palestine to become a full members of the United Nations. This campaign went into different parts of the globe and they ended in New York.\\" Basem Elmary, a coordinator for Palestine at the UN, said that U.S. opposition to the issue needing the involvement of direct negotiations with Israel was \\"the blackmail to us.\\" A U.S. State Department spokesperson said that a veto against the vote should not be surprising. The move also follows an aggressive and at least partially successful campaign by the Palestinians to court recognition in the build-up to the vote, including numerous Latin American countries. Several leaders said they would support Palestine's bid for statehood during the general debates, though US President Barack Obama called for direct dialogue, amidst earlier threats to veto the move in the Security Council.Could Obama Veto Palestine's Application to the United Nations in September? His Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was due to meet separately with both Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the sidelines of the summit. The bid was expected to be submitted on 23 September in the Security Council, even though the 129 member states that recognise Palestine constitute the necessary 2/3 majority; however approval needs nine of 15 of the SC votes, though the U.S. promised to veto the measure. It also follows Obama's widely condemned statement to the UNGA that the recognition should be bilaterally negotiated. Abbas's diplomatic advisor Majdi al-Khaldi said that though the Palestinians believed they could win the votes needed, \\"Three of the members of the Security Council (Bosnia, Gabon and Nigeria) are under pressure from the Americans.\\" In turn, French President Nicolas Sarkozy suggested an alternative proposal temporarily non-member observer state status should be granted with a timetable for new negotiations to conclude in a year. Palestine was, however, admitted as a full member state to UNESCO in October 2011 despite opposition by the United States and Israel, who both threatened and carried out the cutting of funds to the body. Resolutions Resolutions have come before the UNGA between 16 September 2011 and 9 April 2012. Elections The election of non-permanent members to the Security Council for 2012‚Äì2013 was held on 21 and 24 October 2011. Azerbaijan, Guatemala, Morocco, Pakistan and Togo were elected to the UNSC on the first day of voting; however the voting for the seat allocated to Eastern European states was carried over to a second day. Azerbaijan finally won on the seventeenth round of voting, following the withdrawal of Slovenia's candidacy. On 24 October 2011, the Assembly elected 18 members of the Economic and Social Council for three-year terms beginning 1 January 2012. Belarus, Brazil, Burkina Faso, Cuba, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan Lesotho, Libya, Nigeria, Spain and Turkey replaced C√¥te d'Ivoire, Estonia, France, Germany, Guatemala, Guinea‚ÄëBissau, India, Japan, Malta, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, Peru, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Switzerland and Venezuela. Hungary also relinquished the remainder of its term in favour of an \\"internal agreement\\" with Bulgaria, as did the Belgium and Norway in accordance with the Western Europe and Others group's rotation policy to be replaced by Netherlands and Switzerland. While many vacancies were deferred in its subsidiary bodies, some of them did have new members chosen by acclamation. The Executive Board of the World Food Programme had six new members for three-year terms starting on 1 January 2012: Zambia (African Group); China (Asian Group); Japan (Western European and Other Group); United Kingdom (Western European and Other Group); and the Czech Republic (Eastern European Group). Zimbabwe (African Group) was chosen for the Commission on Narcotic Drugs for a four-year term from 1 January 2012, with another African state's election being deferred. Nigeria (African Group) was chosen for the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice for a three-year term beginning on 1 January 2012. Israel (Western Europe and Others Group) was chosen for the Commission on Sustainable Development for a term due to start immediately in 2011 until the close of the Commission's twenty-first session in 2014. Sweden (Western Europe and Others Group) was chosen for the Commission on Science and Technology for Development for a term beginning immediately until 31 December 2014. The triennial election of five judges to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was held on 10 November, 22 November and 13 December 2011. In the first round of voting, the General Assembly and the Security Council concurrently and independently elected Giorgio Gaja (Italy), Hisashi Owada (Japan), Peter Tomka (Slovakia), and Xue Hanqin (China), but the two organs were deadlocked between two African candidates for the fifth available seat. Eventually the two organs elected Julia Sebutinde (Uganda), who had been endorsed by the African Union. The five judges elected in this session will serve nine-year terms beginning on 6 February 2012. A by-election to the ICJ was held on 27 April 2012; the Security Council and the General Assembly concurrently elected Dalveer Bhandari (India) over Florentino Feliciano (Philippines) by a vote of 122 and 13, respectively to replace Awn Shawkat Al-Khasawneh who resigned from the Court in 2011. End of session Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon thanked outgoing President Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser for his leadership of the session.

He concludes that \\"single is the new black\\", which poses serious problems for the African American community. He recommends that black women open themselves up to be willing to enter serious relationships with men of other races and backgrounds, and he argues that it will improve black men and women alike. Contents Banks states that for African American women, it is considered the norm to go through life unmarried and to raise children as a single mother. Specially, he notes the statistics that nine in ten black women married in the 1950s while three in ten currently do so. He writes that this is largely caused because those women will not consider dating men of other races besides their own. He states that Asian and Latino women marry men of other races three times more than black women. He writes about a variety of specific reasons that black women are so uninterested. He states that many women prefer the cultural \\"swagger\\" that they perceive only in black men, whereas other women idealize their fathers and can't imagine marrying a man who is particularly different. He recounts that some black women believe that non-black men are simply uninterested in them. He views this as important but partly dismisses it, citing a 2009 University of California‚ÄìIrvine study of OkCupid that found that some men of other races respond to black women's profiles at higher rates than black men. He views the aforementioned trend as a serious problem for African Americans in general since this prevents solid, nuclear families from forming that strengthen both the parents and the children. Banks criticizes feminists who believe that women forgoing marriage and raising children on their own is inherently good and represents a victory against retrograde patriarchy. He states that people's desire to find a life-time partner to be intimate with is innate across race and culture, and he recounts that the black women without romantic success feel depressed, not elated. He writes, \\"If fears of interracial intimacy keep people separate now, it is because those fears embody the echo of the past. Many of us continue to act out the roles we first began to inhabit long ago.

Biography  Born in Los Angeles, Formhals was a carrier for the Pasadena Star-News, and he graduated from Pasadena High School. He studied art at the Stickney Art School in Los Angeles and was employed for several years as a commercial artist before he began working on comic strips.Formhals bio, AskArt. Formhals was an assistant on Merrill Blosser's Freckles and His Friends beginning in 1935. In 1932, Freckles wore long trousers when he entered Shadyside High School and met his Friends. The Crumpet Hut crowd eventually included his best buddy Lard Smith, Bazoo Botts, Hilda, perky Daisy and the inventive intellectual Nutty Cook. Romance entered the strip after Freckles met June Wayman, a character introduced in 1937. An inspection of strips from different decades reveals that Blosser's artwork continually improved as the strips and characters evolved. After Henry Formhals became Blosser's assistant in 1935, a more realistic style surfaced as Freckles grew older and the strip became more narrative. Eventually, Blosser drew the Sunday strips and Formhals, beginning in 1938, took over the daily strips. By 1939, Freckles was 17 years old, a high school senior and the captain of Shadyside High's football team. Most of his time was spent hanging out with his girlfriend June and his pal Lard, who was often in the company of his girlfriend, Hilda. Freckles' younger brother, Tagalong, aka Tag, also made appearances. During World War II, Formhals was a zone air raid warden in Altadena, and he drew Civilian Defense information into the Sunday strips. His poster for the Altadena Hospitality House, posted all over Southern California, invited servicemen to drop in when they were in that area.Monchak, S.

Its mission is to develop novel, life-extending technologies for patients in the areas of lung disease and organ manufacturing. United Therapeutics is co-headquartered in Silver Spring, Maryland and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, with additional facilities in Magog and Bromont, Quebec; Melbourne and Jacksonville Florida; La Jolla, California; and Manchester, New Hampshire.United Therapeutics Corp. \\"Locations.\\" Accessed October 4, 2020. History United Therapeutics was founded in 1996 by Martine Rothblatt, an American lawyer, author, and entrepreneur, who created Sirius XM. In 1994, Rothblatt's young daughter was diagnosed with a fatal orphan disease, pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Rothblatt sold her telecom stock and started the $3 million PPH Cure Foundation to fund PAH research. By 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved United Therapeutics' new drug Remodulin, a prostacyclin vasodilator used to treat PAH. Remodulin provided PAH patients an alternative to GlaxoSmithKline's Flolan. Within a year of being approved, Remodulin annual sales had reached $50 million. By 2010, annual sales were $300 million and United Therapeutics' share price had increased 800 percent from the 1999 initial public offering price. Over the years, United Therapeutics has completed several strategic acquisitions. In 2011, it acquired Revivicor, a company focused on developing genetic biotechnology platforms to provide alternative tissue sources for treatment. In 2018, it acquired SteadyMed, a medical device company developing injectable therapeutic drugs for pulmonary hypertension. Other acquisitions include SynQuest in 1999 and Cooke Pharma in 2000. United Therapeutics has entered numerous licensing agreements and collaborations with companies such as Eli Lilly and Company, Medtronic, DEKA Research & Development, and with the National Cancer Institute. In October 2020, United Therapeutics‚Äô market capitalization was $4.7 billion. Medicines United Therapeutics products are sold in the U.S., Canada, Central and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. In the U.S., the company has received multiple approvals from the FDA. These cover various strengths and routes of administration for Orenitram, Remodulin, and Tyvaso, each indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, and Unituxin used in the treatment of pediatric patients with high-risk neuroblastoma. United Therapeutics also markets Adcirca (tadalafil) for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension under a licensing agreement with Eli Lilly and Company. In collaboration with Medtronic, United Therapeutics has developed and expects to commercialize an implantable system for Remodulin. The system will provide continuous delivery of Remodulin from a pump implanted in the patient's abdomen through a surgical procedure. In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted an extra clearance to the Unity Subcutaneous Delivery System for Remodulin Injection, also known as the Remunity pump, allowing the system to be used with drug cassettes that have been prefilled by specialty pharmacies. The Remunity system allows for constant, subcutaneous (under-the-skin) delivery of Remodulin, which mimics the effects of prostacyclin, a natural compound that works as a vasodilator keeping blood vessels open. Remunity includes a small, lightweight, ambulatory pump with an intended service life of three years and was developed by United Therapeutics and DEKA. The Remunity system is indicated for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients older than 22. Currently, United Therapeutics and DEKA are working on a new version of the system that will contain disposable components that are prefilled during the manufacturing process. In March 2015, the U.S. FDA approved United Therapeutics‚Äô Biologics License Application (BLA) for Unituxin. Unituxin is a monoclonal antibody used as a second-line treatment for children with high-risk neuroblastoma, a rare form of cancer. Research Work United Therapeutics is advancing a pipeline of research and development projects that includes new indications, formulations, and delivery devices for its existing products, such as the Remunity and Trevyent delivery systems for Remodulin. The company's R&D; pipeline also includes more than a dozen new products to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, end-stage organ disease, and other conditions. In February 2020, United Therapeutics reported that it had successfully completed the INCREASE study of Tyvaso in patients with pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) and that the study met its primary endpoint of demonstrating improvement in six- minute walk distance (6MWD). The company submitted the INCREASE study results to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in support of an efficacy supplement to the Tyvaso New Drug Application, which is expected to result in revised labeling reflecting the outcome of the INCREASE study. Ongoing clinical trials of new medicines include PERFECT (Phase 3) for COPD; ADVANCE CAPACITY and ADVANCE OUTCOMES (Phase 3) for ralinepag in pulmonary hypertension; and SAPPHIRE (Phase 2) for gene therapy. Other medicines being developed include formulations of treprostinil for interstitial lung disease without pulmonary hypertension and dry powder inhaler preparations for pulmonary arterial hypertension. United Therapeutics is developing a unique type of biopharmaceutical medicinal product known as a manufactured organ. This type of biologic would be transplanted into the patient as a substitute for a failing organ. The company has regenerative medicine products such as these being developed via xenotransplantation, allogenic recellularization, and autologous bioprinting technologies. Operations United Therapeutics owns a 415,000-square-foot combination laboratory and office building complex in Silver Spring, Maryland. The facility serves as the company's co-headquarters and is used for commercial manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished dosage form products.

It was recognised as a species in 2011, but the classification was disputed by further research in 2020. By size, the Burrunan dolphin is between the other two species of bottlenose dolphins, and only around 150 individuals have been found in two locations. Taxonomy The species was formally named Tursiops australis by the researcher who described the species, Kate Charlton-Robb of Monash University, and colleagues. The dolphin's common name, burrunan, is an Aboriginal name in the Boonwurrung, Woiwurrung and Taungurung languages, meaning \\"large sea fish of the porpoise kind\\". The species name australis is the Latin adjective \\"southern\\", and refers to the Australian range of the dolphin. The Burrunan dolphin is one of three recognized extant species of Tursiops, the bottlenose dolphins. Some differences had been noted, but for a long time not enough evidence was available to classify it as its own species. However, an examination of their skulls, external characteristics, and DNA from old and current samples revealed unique characteristics which resulted in its classification as a separate species. It is the third time since the late 19th century that a new dolphin species has been recognised. In March 2020, the Canadian Journal of Zoology published \\"Taxonomy and distribution of bottlenose dolphins (genus Tursiops) in Australian waters: an osteological clarification\\" by Maria Jedensj√∂ et al, which questioned the classification of T. australis as a distinct species. The study conducted a comprehensive osteological survey on the skulls of 264 dolphins using 2D and 3D morphometrics, and found that the Burranan dolphin fell well within T. truncatus using both techniques. Description The Burrunan dolphin is dark bluish-gray at the top near to the dorsal fin extending over the head and sides of the body. Along the midline, it is a lighter gray which extends as a blaze over on the side near the dorsal fin. Ventrally, it is off-white, which reaches over the eye and the flipper in some instances. It is smaller than the common bottlenose dolphin, but larger than the Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin, measuring between in length. Distribution and habitat The recognition of T. australis sp. nov. is particularly significant given the endemism of this new species to a small geographic region of southern and south-eastern Australia. Only two resident populations of the Burrunan dolphin have been identified, one in Port Phillip and the other in the Gippsland Lakes. Their combined population has been estimated as about 100 in Port Phillip and 50 in Gippsland. Additionally, T. australis haplotypes have been documented in dolphins located in waters off eastern Tasmania, and in coastal waters of South Australia in the Spencer Gulf region and west to St Francis Island. The initial report on the Burrunan dolphin suggested that the low number of individuals found might immediately qualify the species for protection under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The species is found in estuaries and sheltered bays of the southern coasts of Australia, often in locations that make them vulnerable to human activities. Anthropogenic disturbances such as, Dolphin- swim tour vessels, detract Burrunan dolphins from foraging and resting; therefore, decreasing the biological fitness and sightings of this species.

It parallels and complements chapter 3, the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: each begins with the jealousy of non-Jews towards successful Jews and an imperial edict requiring them to compromise their religion, and concludes with divine deliverance and a king who confesses the greatness of the God of the Jews and issues an edict of royal protection. The tales making up chapters 1‚Äì6 of Daniel are no earlier than the Hellenistic period (3rd to 2nd century BC) and were probably originally independent, but were collected in the mid-2nd century BC and expanded shortly afterwards with the visions of the later chapters to produce the modern book. The final part of Daniel 14, within the deutero-canonical additions to Daniel, also describes an incident when Daniel is thrown into a lions' den.: New American Bible Revised Edition Summary of the biblical narrative In Daniel 6, Daniel is raised to high office by his royal master Darius the Mede. Daniel's jealous rivals trick Darius into issuing a decree that for thirty days no prayers should be addressed to any god or man but Darius himself; any who break this are to be thrown to the lions. Daniel continues to pray daily to the God of Israel, and the king, although deeply distressed, must condemn Daniel to death, for the edicts of the Medes and Persians cannot be altered. Hoping for Daniel's deliverance, he has him cast into the pit. At daybreak the king hurries to the place and cries out anxiously, asking if God had saved his friend. Daniel replies that his God had sent an angel to close the jaws of the lions, \\"because I was found blameless before him\\". The king commands that those who had conspired against Daniel should be thrown to the lions in his place with their wives and children, and that the whole world should tremble and fear before the God of Daniel. Composition and structure It is generally accepted that the Book of Daniel originated as a collection of folktales among the Babylonian diaspora, the Jewish community living in Babylon and Mesopotamia, in the Persian and Hellenistic periods (5th to 2nd centuries BC). Chapters 4‚Äì6, which includes the tale of Daniel in the lions' den, may belong to the earliest stage, as these differ quite markedly in the oldest texts. Although the entire book is traditionally ascribed to Daniel the seer, the tales of chapters 1‚Äì6, including the story of the lion's den, are the voice of an anonymous narrator (except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar). It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition. Chapters 2‚Äì7 are in Aramaic, and are in the clear form of a chiasm (a poetic structure in which the main point or message of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by further repetitions on either side): * A. (2:4b-49) ‚Äì A dream of four kingdoms replaced by a fifth ** B. (3:1‚Äì30) ‚Äì Daniel's three friends in the fiery furnace *** C. (4:1‚Äì37) ‚Äì Daniel interprets a dream for Nebuchadnezzar *** C'. (5:1‚Äì31) ‚Äì Daniel interprets the handwriting on the wall for Belshazzar ** B'. (6:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì Daniel in the lions' den * A'. (7:1‚Äì28) ‚Äì A vision of four world kingdoms replaced by a fifth The story of Daniel in the lions' den in chapter 6 is paired with the story of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and the \\"fiery furnace\\" in Daniel 3. The parallels include the jealousy of non-Jews, an imperial edict requiring Jews to compromise their religion on pain of death, and divine deliverance. Each story climaxes with the king confessing the greatness of the God of the Jews and issuing an edict of royal protection. In each case life is preserved through divine presence in the fire or the pit. The structure of Daniel 6 itself is also in the form of a chiasm: :A. Introduction: Daniel‚Äôs success (vv.1‚Äì3) ::B. Darius‚Äôs edict and Daniel‚Äôs response (vv.4‚Äì10) :::C. Daniel‚Äôs opponents plot his death (vv.11‚Äì15) ::::D. Darius hopes for Daniel‚Äôs deliverance (vv.16‚Äì18) ::::D'. Darius witnesses Daniel‚Äôs deliverance (vv.19‚Äì23) :::C'. Daniel‚Äôs opponents sentenced to death (v.24) ::B'. Darius‚Äôs edict and doxology (v.25‚Äì27) :A'. Conclusion: Daniel‚Äôs success (v.28) Rabbinic literature Daniel in the lions' den saved by Habakkuk, as described in rabbinic literature (France, 15th century). According to Josippon, \\"the beasts in the den received Daniel as faithful dogs might receive their returning master, wagging their tails and licking him\\". The Midrash Tehillim says that \\"the mouth of the den was closed with a huge stone, which had rolled of itself from Palestine to Babylon for that purpose\\" and that \\"upon this stone sat an angel in the shape of a lion, so that Daniel's enemies might not harass him.\\"Daniel, Jewish Encyclopedia (1906).  Artistic representations  = In visual arts = Although Daniel is sometimes depicted as a young man in illustrations of the incident, James Montgomery Boice points out that he would have been over eighty years old at the time.

Wallichs, that also had stores in West Covina, Lakewood, Canoga Park, Costa Mesa, Torrance, and Hawthorne from 1940‚Äì1978 and was one of the first to display cellophane sealed albums in racks. Wallichs stayed open until 2 am. Glenn Wallichs Glenn Everett Wallichs was born August 9, 1910 in Grand Island, Nebraska, to Union Pacific accountant Oscar Wallichs. In 1926, the family moved to North Hollywood. In 1932, Wallichs opened a radio shop in Los Angeles, later opening five other shops in the area. In the mid‚Äê1930s, he started two recording studios. In 1940, Wallichs opened Music City, at Sunset & Vine. In 1946, Wallichs left the business to his brother Clyde. Glenn Wallichs died in 1971, and Wallichs Music City closed in 1978. History Wallichs Music City was located on the northwest corner of Sunset & Vine and operated from 1940 to 1978. Owner Glenn E. Wallichs, along with Tin Pan Alley songsmith Johnny Mercer and ex-Paramount movie producer Buddy De Sylva, had founded Capitol Records, starting in a small office on Vine Street in 1942 and then moving to larger offices above the store in 1946. After Capitol Records moved to the Capitol Tower in 1956, the offices became the home of Dot Records. In an era when most recorded music was sold through mom and pop stores, Wallichs Music City became the premier record store in Southern California and the world's largest specialty record store. As the market for recorded music evolved during the 1950s and 1960s, it was a source of tickets, sheet music, vinyl (initially 78s, then LP's & 45's) and tapes (8 track and cassette). They also sold TV sets and musical instruments. It was one of the first music stores to seal record albums in cellophane and put them in display racks for customers to browse. The racks were tabletop height trapezoid-shaped browser boxes (designed by Capitol Records' Frederick Rice) that allowed the covers to be viewed like a card index. The store was also the first to have demonstration booths for listening to records. The store became a hub of the L.A. music scene. Music fans flocked there to meet artists like Bing Crosby, Judy Garland, Johnny Mercer and Nat King Cole to have them sign sheet music of their latest hits. Frank Zappa worked part-time there in 1965 as a salesman in the singles department.Zappa, Frank. The Real Frank Zappa Book. London: Picador, 1989. p. 61 Radio ads featured Wallichs, who would sing the jingle \\"It's Music City\\" (to the first notes of \\"Rock-a-bye Baby,\\" with the following four bars covered by a jazz ensemble), followed by news of specials, upcoming events, etc. In 1963, the vocal group The Pleasures recorded the song \\"Music City\\" as a tribute to the store.

Best known for his body of work Juvenile-in-Justice, his work turns a lens on the placement and treatment of American juveniles housed by law in facilities that treat, confine, punish, assist and, occasionally, harm them. Ross has been the recipient of grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, Annie E. Casey Foundation and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and the Center for Cultural Innovation. Ross was awarded both Fulbright and Guggenheim Fellowships. Three books and traveling exhibitions of the work continue to see great success while Ross collaborates with juvenile justice stakeholders, using the images as a catalyst for change. His latest projects shifts from kids in detention to those in dependency and dual custodies to now markers of success. The focus is now towards being an advocate's advocate and creating compelling stories for legislators to get better outcomes for kids in juvenile detention, foster care and dependency systems. Ross in 2017 Published works Ross's first book, Museology, a photographic examination of museums and the display of art and historical objects, was published by Aperture Foundation in 1989 and features an introduction by Marcia Tucker, founder of the New Museum and former curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and an essay by David Mellor, art historian and curator. His second book, Gathering Light explores natural and artificial light and its intrinsic relationship to photography itself through photographs of objects and places from all over the world. The book featured an introduction by Dave Hickey, a prominent art and culture critic, and an essay by Eduardo Cadava, faculty in the Department of English at Princeton University. Ross focused on juvenile incarceration for Juvenile in Justice (2012) Published in 2004, Ross's third book, Waiting for the End of the World is compiled of photographs of bomb and other underground shelters the world over, including an underground city in Beijing, China. Michael Darling, chief curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, wrote about Waiting for the End of the World that \\"Ross's images of bomb shelters represent a crushing indictment of the current state of world affairs as well as a clarion call to action.\\" The book features an interview with Richard Ross by Sarah Vowell, a New York Times best selling author. After Waiting for the End of the World Ross published three books compiling successful U.S patent applications from the last century; Patently Ridiculous, Patently Erotic and Patently Christmas. The books were published by Plume. In 2007, with Aperture Foundation, Ross published Architecture of Authority. The book was included in Photo District News best books of 2007 and the accompanying exhibition was number 10 on the ArtForum list of best shows of 2007. The book features an essay by John R. MacArthur, publisher of Harper's Magazine. Ross's first book covering the U.S. juvenile justice system, Juvenile in Justice, was published in 2012 with a foreword by Ira Glass and an essay by Bart Lubow. The nearly 150 images in the book were made over 5 years of visiting more than 1,000 youth confined in more than 200 juvenile institutions in 31 states. Girls in Justice, the much-anticipated follow up to Juvenile in Justice, turns our focus specifically to girls in the juvenile justice system. Girls in Justice, was published in 2015 with a foreword by Marian Wright Edelman and an essay from Maisha T. Winn. With appallingly high rates of abuse in their histories, exploitation around every corner, and a very different set of needs once ‚Äòinside,‚Äô girls are brought into the juvenile justice system by a unique set of social forces and experience incarceration much differently than boys. While the number of youth in the juvenile justice system has steadily declined, girls are a growing share of youth arrested, detained and committed. Juvie Talk: Unlocking the language of juvenile in justice, is the third book of the award winning in Justice series. This book and accompanying website, Juvie Talk, are meant to be a curricular tool for a discussion of human rights, mass incarceration and the potential for children to succeed. While it is important to be able to empathize with these kids, it is also critical to realize there are multitudes of ways the words can be spoken, and even be rewritten. Peter Sellars offers ideas about the nature of theater and roles in an essay for Juvie Talk. Exhibitions Ross has exhibited his work extensively both nationally and internationally. Some of his solo exhibitions include ACME in Los Angeles (Architecture of Authority), Aperture Gallery in New York (Architecture of Authority), the National Building Museum in Washington D.C (Architecture of Authority), the Orange County Museum of Art (Gathering Light), the Santa Barbara Museum of Art (Gathering Light), and the Sonnenberg in Lucerne, Switzerland (Waiting for the End of the World).

It is located in 52 km east of Gorakhpur Airport. The airport is in 590 acres, has a single airstrip of 3.2 kilometers46 metres. It is capable of handling large aircraft. After DGCA license , airport will be in function condition... History and development On June 24th, 2020 Union Cabinet Committee under the Chairmanship of Honorable PM Shri Narendra Modi decided to recognize Kushinagar Airport as an International Airport.. It will be India's 29th International Airport and fourth of Uttar Pradesh including the under construction Jewar Airport. This airport also has strategic importance as International Border is nearby. The airport lies near an important Buddhist pilgrimage site, where Gautama Buddha has attained Parinirvana after his death. The State Government plans to develop the airport to cater to international tourists who visit this site. The government has acquired 650 acres of land for this project at a cost of Rs 180 crores. The Central Government has agreed to a Viability gap funding (VGF) of 20%. The airport will be built through a joint venture between State Government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The project was initially intended to be developed on PPP model at an estimated cost of Rs.354 Crores. The State Government had selected IL&FS; Infrastructure Development Company Limited as PPP project consultants. The project got an \\"In Principle Approval\\" from the Ministry of Civil Aviation (India) in September 2010. The government received 15 technical bids in 2013 from reputed infrastructure companies for development of the airport. The state cabinet cleared the project and approved the financial bid document in January 2014. But despite several attempts to reduce the cost and the size of the project, the government could not convince private players about its viability. In May 2015, the state government decided to take the support of AAI to go ahead with the project. Funds of Rs.199.00 Crores for the proposed International Airport at Kushinagar was released in November 2017 by Uttar Pradesh led by Shri Yogi Adityanath. and during UP Investor Summit in February 2018, CM Yogi Adityanath announced that the airport at Kushinagar will be operational from mid of 2018 this will be a massive development by any government in this region which will provide direct and indirect employment to this region. Due to some technical reasons the airport will still take some time to commence operations. In June 2020, the airport has been awarded international status to attract Buddhist pilgrims. Destinations Under UDAN scheme Kushinagar will be connected with Gaya and Lucknow.. In the end of this year Kushinagar will be connected with Various Countries like Srilanka , Thailand , Singapore , Kathmandu , Japan...

This village is on the Clarence Way between Bonalbo and Urbenville. This was the site of the original Bonalbo, the \\"Old\\" was added to its name in the early 1900s when a new settlement also called Bonalbo was built on the banks of Peacock Creek 11 kilometres to the south. In the 1961 census Old Bonalbo had a population of 240 and in 2006 it was recorded as having 281 people resident. The town's name supposedly derives from the Gidabal word 'Bunawalbu' meaning 'bloodwood trees'. The first European settler in the area was J.D. McLean, a Scots settler who drove his sheep up from the Hunter Region in 1841 when the depression struck. He established the 'Bunalbo' or Duck Creek run and later became a major pastoralist and the treasurer of Queensland. The Robertson Land Acts of 1861 opened the territories up to free selectors (small landowners) but it was not until 1887 that the first, Donald McIntyre, took up a section of the old station, although the Robertson family had selected various sections themselves, possibly prior to 1880. It was at this time that Australian red cedar-getters first moved into the area. The Bonalbo village later developed on a part of McIntyre's holding which fronted onto Peacock Creek. However, the depression of the 1890s drove a number of selectors away, including McIntyre who sold his land to Paddy McNamee. New selectors appeared in the 1900s when McNamee proved the land was arable and when sawmills opened up west of the range. Old Bonalbo has a Community Postal Agency operating between 8.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. Monday through Friday. Beef cattle grazing is the main agricultural activity of the region. A number of timber plantations have been planted in the area.Clean And Green - Villages - Oldbonalbo In January 2011 Old Bonalbo was isolated by floodwaters from Duck Creek which cut off the village and left many individual properties around the village isolated.

RSCS also transmits commands and messages among users and systems. RSCS is the software that powered the world‚Äôs largest network (or network of networks) prior to the Internet and directly influenced both internet development and user acceptance of networking between independently managed organizations. RSCS was developed by Edson Hendricks and T.C. Hartmann. Both as an IBM product and as an IBM internal network, it later became known as VNET. The network interfaces continued to be called the RSCS compatible protocols and were used to interconnect with IBM systems other than VM systems (typically MVS) and non- IBM computers. The history of this program, and its influence on IBM and the IBM user community, is described in contemporaneous accounts and interviews by Melinda Varian.Varian Technical goals and innovations are described by Creasy Creasy and by Hendricks and HartmannHendricks and Hartmann in seminal papers. Among academic users, the same software was employed by BITNET and related networks worldwide. Background RSCS arose because people throughout IBM recognized a need to exchange files. Hendricks‚Äôs solution was CPREMOTE, which he completed by mid-1969. CPREMOTE was the first example of a ‚Äúservice virtual machine‚Äù and was motivated partly by the desire to prove the usefulness of that concept. In 1971, Norman L. Rasmussen,The father of Nicolas Rasmussen. Manager of IBM‚Äôs Cambridge Scientific Center (CSC), asked Hendricks to find a way for the CSC machine to communicate with machines at IBM‚Äôs other Scientific Centers. CPREMOTE had taught Hendricks so much about how a communications facility would be used and what function was needed in such a facility, that he decided to discard it and begin again with a new design. After additional iterations, based on feedback from real users and contributed suggestions and code from around the company, Hendricks and Tim Hartmann, of the IBM Technology Data Center in Poughkeepsie, NY, produced RSCS, which went into operation within IBM in 1973. The first version of RSCS distributed outside of IBM (1975) was not a complete networking package. It included uncalled subroutines for functions such as store-and-forward that were included in the IBM internal version. The store-and-forward function was added in the VNET PRPQ,A PRPQ (Programming Request for Price Quotation), was an IBM administrative term for software that was available but not fully supported as an IBM product first for files, and then for messages and commands. Once those capabilities were added, ‚Äúthe network began to grow like crazy.‚ÄùVarian, p. 41 Although at first the IBM network depended on people going to their computer room and dialing a phone, it soon began to acquire leased lines. At SHARE XLVI, in February, 1976, Hendricks and Hartmann reported that the network, which was now beginning to be called VNET, spanned the continent and connected 50 systems. By SHARE 52, in March, 1979, they reported that VNET connected 239 systems, in 38 U.S. cities and 10 other countries. ‚ÄúVNET passed 1000 nodes in 1983 and 3000 nodes in 1989. It currently (1990s) connects somewhat more than 4000 nodes, about two-thirds of which are VM systems.‚Äù Varian, p. 42 In comparison, by 1981 the ARPANET consisted of 213 host computers. Both ARPANET and VNET continued to grow rapidly. By 1986, IBM‚Äôs Think magazine estimated that VNET was saving the company $150,000,000 per year as the result of increased productivity. Other RSCS Protocol Compatible Networks Due to the key role RSCS played in building networks, the line drivers became known as the \\"RSCS Protocols\\". The supported protocols were drawn from other programs. The CPREMOTE protocol may have been the very first symmetrical protocol (sometimes called a \\"balanced\\" protocol). To expand the RSCS network to include MVS, Hartmann reverse-engineered the HASP Network Job Interface protocol, which enabled the network to grow rapidly. He later added the JES2 Network Job Entry as an RSCS/VNET line driver. BITNET was a cooperative United States university network founded in 1981 by Ira Fuchs at the City University of New York (CUNY) and Greydon Freeman at Yale University which was based on VNET. The first network link was between CUNY and Yale. The BITNET (RSCS) protocols were eventually ported to non-IBM computer systems, and became widely implemented under VAX/VMS in addition to DECnet. At its zenith around 1991, BITNET extended to almost 500 organizations and 3,000 nodes, all educational institutions. It spanned North America (in Canada it was known as NetNorth), Europe (as EARN), India (TIFR) and some Persian Gulf states (as GulfNet). BITNET was also very popular in other parts of the world, especially in South America, where about 200 nodes were implemented and heavily used in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Over time, BITNET was eventually merged into the Internet. Technical Issues R. J. Creasy described RSCS as an operating system and considered it an essential component of the VM/370 Time-Sharing System. \\"The Virtual Machine Facility/370, VM/370 for short, is a convenient name for three different operating systems: the Control Program (CP), the Conversational Monitor System (CMS), and the Remote Spooling and Communications Subsystem (RSCS). Together they form a general purpose tool for the delivery of the computing resources of the IBM System/ 370 machines to a wide variety of people and computers. ...RSCS is the operating system used to provide information transfer among machines linked with communications facilities.\\"Creasy, p 483 Details of the design of RSCS as a virtual machine subsystem are described in the IBM Systems Journal. From a technical point of view, RSCS differed from ARPANET in that it was a point-to-point \\"store and forward\\" network, as such it was more like UUCP. Unlike ARPANET, it did not require dedicated Interface Message Processor or continuous network connections.

This group was established in 1996 as part of the ‚Äúnew circus‚Äù movement and travels frequently around the world. The circus is one of the most active Finnish group touring abroad, having appeared in theaters and in cultural festivals in about thirty countries. Circo Aereo has been called ‚Äúa sparkling tribute to the circus‚Äù (Le Figaro, France), ‚Äúhalf circus, half cabaret‚Äù (Le Monde, France) and ‚Äúa treasure chest full of the things of which circus is made, filled with beautiful sights, meticulous joint efforts and inventive surprises‚Äù (Helsingin Sanomat, Finland) . Circo Aereo also has held workshops for schools and circus performers, along with other educational projects. In order to develop the concept of the traditional circus, Circo Aereo incorporates other art forms into its shows, such as elements of theatre and dance, with audience interaction playing an important part. Super 8 was created in 2004, which combined traditional magic tricks, super 8 films and elements of video games. Trippo was also created in 2004 and geared for children, playing mostly in Scandinavian countries and France. In 2005, Circo Aereo created two musically dominant shows. The first was called the Louisiana Circus, co produced with the UMO Jazz Orchestra and in collaboration with Fritt Fall Rinne Radio, a Finnish electro-jazz band. This production consisted of six artists and twenty musicians, combining circus with a cabaret atmosphere. In 2007, an air show called ‚ÄúPiece for Two Ropes‚Äù opened, choreographed by Sanna Silvernnoinen and another show called FUR! by Maksim Komaro, both with the aim of combining contemporary circus and contemporary dance. In the latter production, artists from various countries, traditions and specialties created their own variations of traditional movements. Circo Aereo has worked with Sirque, pole circus Nexon in Limousin since 2007. Circo Aereo‚Äôs most recent production is called ‚ÄúEspresso,‚Äù which is performed along with French juggling group Les Objets Volants. The show features four artists who create scenes and stories, on the ground and in the air, with juggling, dance and aerials, but no words. According to director Maksim Komaro, Espresso is a journey through the history of circus, following Komaros own circus experience from the traditional to cabaret and the contemporary circus of Europe. Espresso is one of Circo Aereo's biggest successes. Helsingin Sanomat called the work ‚Äúa treasure chest filled with beautiful sights, meticulous efforts and inventive surprises,‚Äù while Le Monde said, ‚Äúintelligence and virtuosity are embedded in the magical vignettes.‚Äù The show was created in 2006, touring for three years in and around Europe especially in the Parc de la Villette in Paris, at the Th√©√¢tre de Vidy-Lausanne in Switzerland and the Damascus Opera House, Syria. In 2009, the show and the circus itself made its North American debut, performing eight eastern U.S. states. This tour was considered important to opening up the North American circus market to less- traditional shows. In 2011, Espresso and Circo Aereo returned to the continent to perform at Wabash College in Indiana, Brigham Young University in Utah and the Festival Internacional Cervantino in Guanajuato, Mexico .

The house and its dependencies were unusually elaborate for northern Virginia. History The house was built about 1790 by Dr. Wilson Cary Selden of the Selden family on a property that he had inherited from his first wife, Mary Mason Selden, who was a niece of George Mason. Selden and his second wife, Eleanor Love Selden, expanded the property as the centerpiece of a plantation. In 1835 Selden's son Wilson Cary Selden, Jr. inherited the property, but sold it in 1846 to General George Rust, who expanded the house to the rear. The property played a role in the American Civil War when the Battle of Ball's Bluff was fought on the plantation's lands, with Confederate General Jubal Early using the house as a headquarters. The house had fallen into disrepair by the 1970s, and was destroyed by fire in August 1980. Description Exeter was a seven-part house. It was dominated by a two-story tetrastyle Ionic portico with Chinese Chippendale railings on the upper level, added in the 1830s to replace a one-story pedimented portico. The portico was flanked by single recessed bays, then by hyphens recessed farther back, and finally by small pavilions on either end. The mass of the house was reduced by a gambrel roof on the upper story. The interior featured an entrance hall with a stair hall behind, with a parlor to the south and a dining room to the north. Three main bedrooms were upstairs. The house retained most of its original woodwork. An 1850s addition housed additional rooms to the rear. A number of outbuildings surrounded the house, one of which has been restored as a community center. A barn was demolished to construct the bypass for U.S. Route 15. Exeter was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 14, 1973 and was de-listed after its destruction by fire in August 1980.

As a young priest, he drove along the dirt roads to remote villages where he got to know the residents and said Mass with them. He developed relationships with the local paramount chiefs and elders and soon came to see Sierra Leone as a place where he had always belonged. His practical approach involved training community workers as well as the establishent of hospitals, schools and pastoral centers.

He was also the first head of the chemistry department at Stanford University, as well as its first Chemistry Professor. His most enduring work was the posthumously published book The Story of Early Chemistry, decades later republished as The Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry.  Biography  Son of physician Jacob Davis Babcock Stillman and of Caroline Maxson, John Maxson studied chemistry first at University of California (1874), and then for two years abroad at University of Strasbourg and University of W√ºrzburg. On his return, after teaching at the University of California (1876-1882), and working for the American Sugar Refining Company in Boston (1882-1891), he was appointed at the newly founded Stanford University as its first Chemistry Professor, and head of the department in its opening year. Although Stillman's appointment was essentially by fiat of Senator Stanford, who proposed a one-man list for David Starr Jordan to consider for this job, Stanford historian Eric Hutchinson writes that \\"There is always a risk that appointments made at the behest of the mighty may turn out badly, but Stillman‚Äôs appointment was a good one.\\" At Stanford, Stillman focused mostly on teaching and administration. He retired in 1917, and concentrated on writing thereafter. He died in December 1923. A 39-page in memoriam volume was published in the following year by five colleagues at Stanford. Stillman married Emma E. Rodolph. They had three daughters, Cara, Minna and Dorothy. Cara Stillman was a victim of the 1903 Iroquois Theatre fire in Chicago.  Publications  Stillman's most significant work is The Story of Early Chemistry, a book published posthumously in 1924. A 1925 review in the Journal of Chemical Education by Edgar Fahs Smith found the book excellent but rather impersonal. The book was republished in 1960 by Courier Dover with the slightly modified title The Story of Alchemy and Early Chemistry. A review of this edition by historian Rhoda Rappaport (1962) in the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences found it among the \\"best and most detailed treatments of a difficult subject\\", but criticized it for not being selective enough in deciding which of \\"those features of ancient and medieval thought and practice made a 'decided impress' upon the subsequent history\\" as the book's introduction promised. The book was described by Aaron John Ihde in The Development of Modern Chemistry (1964) as \\"an excellent account of the developments through Lavoisier\\", with the additional observations that \\"although subsequent scholarship has thrown new light on several matters, it is still one of the best American books on the subject.\\" The editor of the Ambix journal remarked in 1994 that the Dover edition of Stillman's book was still in print and still worth reading. Regarding Stillman's overall work, Hutchinson (1977) writes: \\"Disregarding his papers on subjects other than science, Stillman published a total of nineteen papers and one book‚Äîand, even so, managed to acquire a good reputation as a chemist. Of those publications, seven papers and his book on the history of alchemy were the product of his retirement years. Yet, slender as Stillman‚Äôs output may seem by modern standards, what he did write was marked by scholarship of a high quality. In spite of the fact that he was not a strong classical scholar, and in spite of the meager resources of early California libraries as regards medieval manuscripts, Stillman‚Äôs studies in the history of science are carefully researched and clearly written.\\"  References   External links  * Works at Open Library Category:1852 births Category:1923 deaths Category:American chemists Category:American science writers ","title":"John Maxson Stillman"},{"id":"33090476","text":"These are the list of Terrorist attacks in Pakistan in 2010.

Whereas at least another 8 others were killed in other such violent incidents across this major Pakistani city. It is now known that at least 60 people, including several political activists, are now known to have been killed in a recent spate of violence to sweep across the city in as many such days.\\"Fresh attacks kill 16 in Karachi\\" PRESS TV, 20 October 2010 *22 October:- At least 6 Pakistani paramilitary soldiers, including a Pakistani Army colonel, were killed and 3 others injured in a roadside bomb explosion within the Yakh Kandaw area of the Orakzai Agency, which is located near to the Afghan border, of north-western Pakistan. It was later reported that the attack occurred, as a convoy of paramilitary troops was hit by a remote- controlled landmine and reports are claiming that this was the third bomb attack targeting soldiers on patrol in the area, in as many days. This bomb attack occurred amid claims that the Pakistani military has declared victory over the Pakistani Taliban this Summer. However local residents in the area have claimed that not all the Taliban hideouts in the area were wiped out, in the Pakistani military offensive, which was conducted earlier this year. At least 5 people were killed and 22 others injured, in a bomb attack at a mosque within the provincial capital of the north-western Pakistani city of Peshawar. It was later known that the bomb was detonated during Friday prayers, in an effort to maximize casualties. The Pakistani Taliban are strong suspects in the executing of this particular bomb attack.\\"Six Pakistani troops killed by landmine\\" BBC News, 22 October 2010\\"Taliban bomb mosque in Peshawar, kill 5\\" THE LONG WAR JOURNAL, 22 October 2010 *24 October:- Unidentified militants torched 2 NATO vehicles in two separate incidents, within Pakistan's south- western Balochistan Province, which were carrying supplies to foreign forces fighting within neighbouring Afghanistan.

It was later known that two young men riding a motorcycle, had planted the explosive device in a milk churn on a motorcycle and had left it near the gate of the shrine of Baba Farid, a 12th-century Sufi Islamic saint within the city. It is known that at least 1 woman was amongst those killed in this particular bomb attack and that some of those injured in this bomb blast, are known to be in a critical condition at hospital. However, a doctor at a local hospital later claimed that at least 2 women were among those killed in this bomb attack. Local police suspected that this explosive device was detonated by remote control only a few minutes after it was planted in the area. Several nearby shops were reportedly damaged in this bomb explosion, although the marble mausoleum of Baba Farid itself was largely undamaged in this bomb attack. It is known that local TV footage later showed the twisted and charred remains of the motorcycle, in which the bomb was planted upon, as well as the debris from the nearby shops damaged in this bomb explosion. A prominent Sufi scholar later accused the government of not doing enough to prevent his community from coming under such terrorist-related attacks. This attack, is the latest as yet to target the Sufi minority, as suicide bombers have recently targeted such Sufi Shrines right across the country, such as in the Pakistani cities of both Karachi and Lahore. No group has yet claimed responsibility for this latest bomb attack, although the Pakistani Taliban are strong suspects for carrying out this bomb attack. At least 3 people were killed and 2 others injured, after a roadside bomb struck a passenger van within the Orakzai tribal region, of north-western Pakistan. It was reported by witnesses that this bomb blast tore apart the vehicle, which was apparently passing near the village of Tanda, when this roadside bomb attack occurred. The Pakistani Taliban are suspected of carrying out this roadside bombing.\\"Six killed by bomb at Sufi shrine in Pakistan's Punjab\\" BBC News, 25 October 2010\\"Roadside blast kills three in Orakzai\\" DAWN, 25 October 2010 *1 November:- At least 2 police officers were killed and 13 others injured in a suicide bombing outside the Shah Mansoor compound.

It was later reported that the force of the bomb explosion was so powerful that the roof of the mosque apparently caved in and reportedly all that was left remaining was one wall of the building. Witnesses in the local area claimed that the bomber who was on foot, detonated his explosives at the main gate to the mosque, just after Friday prayers had finished and worshippers were departing from the mosque. The force of this explosion was apparently so powerful that some witnesses have apparently reported about being tossed in the air by the blast, being knocked to the ground or even simply hearing a big explosion. Witnesses have also claimed that the scene of the suicide blast resembled that of a graveyard and it is known that a number of children were among those killed and injured in this suicide bombing. It is known that local ambulances, volunteers and medical personnel ferried the survivors no nearby hospitals, including the Lady Reading Hospital in the major Pakistani city of Peshawar, which is located 30 miles north of the village. The authorities have claimed that the death toll is likely to rise, as some of those injured are apparently in a critical condition and they fear more bodies may be salvaged from the debris. It has been reported that a local tribal elder who encouraged people to take a stand against the Taliban may have possibly been the target for this suicide bombing. There has been a number of militant attacks culminating in mosque and shrine bombings recently however it was not immediately clear who carried out this suicide bombing. However it is known that the Pakistani Taliban have previously claimed responsibility for such similar attacks in the past and are known to have been most active in the Darra area of the region. This particular suicide attack is the deadliest such attack since a suicide bomber targeted a Shia Muslim rally in the south-western Pakistani city of Quetta. Media correspondents are claiming that this latest suicide bombing may have been a response by Taliban militants to the recent military and army offensives occurring within the Darra region, of north-western Pakistan.\\"Attack on mosque in north-west Pakistan 'kills 45'\\" BBC News, November 5, 2010\\"Death toll in Pakistan mosque suicide bombing over 70\\" BBC News, November 6, 2010 *11 November:- At least 20 people were killed and more than 100 others injured in a suicide truck bombing, which targeted the Criminal Investigation Department building within Pakistan's major, southern city of Karachi. It was later reported by police witnesses, that they had exchanged fire with the militants for at least 15 minutes, as they tried to storm the building. However then a truck which was laden with explosives detonated as it struck the boundary wall, almost completely destroying the structure. This truck bomb explosion was apparently so large that it was heard across some several miles of Pakistan's biggest city of Karachi. Eyewitnesses have also claimed that the blast left a crater some three meters wide. TV footage later showed bloodied victims being shifted away on stretchers and dozens of security personnel combing through the wreckage of this bomb explosion. A government spokeswoman, Sharmilla Farooqi, later claimed that 5 police officers were known to be among the fatalities of this truck bombing. There are some reports claiming that women police officers may be among the casualties, as there was a women's police station inside the building that was targeted. The site of this bomb explosion is within a high-security area of this major city, near to the Sindh Province chief minister's residence and several luxury hotels. Surrounding buildings were also apparently damaged in this bomb explosion, which shattered windows within a two-mile radius. This latest attack comes a day after the same such unit arrested some several wanted militants within the city, said to have been linked to Pakistan's most dangerous militant group of Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, which is linked to al-Qaeda and has been involved in a spate of high-profile attacks across the country. No group has yet claimed responsibility for this latest truck bomb attack, although the Pakistani Taliban have recently been behind a spate of similar such bombings targeting police and army compounds within recent months and years.\\"Karachi CID building hit by bomb and gun attack\\" BBC News, November 11, 2010 *30 November:- At least 6 people were killed and around 20 others injured in a suicide bombing, which targeted a police van within the Pakistani city of Bannu. It is known that the suicide bomber had attacked the police vehicle on foot within the city, which is located within the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, of north-western Pakistan. The fatalities of this suicide blast apparently included at least 1 police officer, 2 children and 3 other civilians. The area in which this suicide attack took place is positioned close to the Afghan- Pakistan border and is apparently a stronghold for the Pakistani Taliban and al-Qaeda. The Pakistan Army has launched military offensives within the region however these suicide attacks still occur throughout the north-west of the country with near impunity.\\"Pakistan suicide blast kills six\\" BBC News, November 30, 2010 *6 December:- At least 50 people were killed and more than 100 others injured, after two suicide bombers targeted a government compound within the main town of Ghalanai, which is located in the Mohmand Agency, of north-western Pakistan. It was later reported that two suicide bombers disguised in police uniforms perpetrated the attacks, as they targeted government officials meeting anti-Taliban allies. It is known that over 100 people were said to be inside the compound at the time of these two suicide attacks, as talks were in progression between government officials, tribal elders and local anti-Taliban groups. Witnesses are claiming that an undisclosed number of tribal elders, police officers and at least two journalists were amongst those killed. Eyewitnesses who witnessed the blasts claim that a deafening sound occurred followed by clouds of dust and smoke, with dozens of people on the ground, who were bleeding and crying, with reports of body parts scattered within the compound. A local administration later confirmed to the media that a suicide bomber on a motorbike had detonated his explosives, after he had driven up to a sitting area at the meeting. Whereas the second suicide attacker, also on a motorcycle had detonated his explosive device at the gate to this government compound. A possible target for these suicide attacks was Mohmand's top political official, Amjad Ali Khan, who was not killed or injured in these bombings. This top political official later confirmed that the suicide bombers had packed their suicide vests with ball-bearings, thus increasing the number of casualties. It was reported that about 25 people of whom were seriously injured in these suicide attacks, were taken for hospital treatment in the north-western Pakistani city of Peshawar. The area in which these attacks occurred borders neighbouring Afghanistan and is a known stronghold for the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for these two suicide attacks. Despite Pakistan Army military offensives within this particular region, it is known that militant attacks still continue on a regular basis.\\"Pakistan suicide bomb attack kills dozens\\" BBC News, December 6, 2010 *7 December:- At least 2 people were killed and 8 others injured, after a suicide bomber attempted to assassinate Chief Minister, Nawab Muhammad Aslam Khan Raisani, within the Pakistani city of Quetta, which is located in Pakistan's south-western Balochistan Province. It was later reported however that the Chief Minister was not harmed in this suicide attack. As he was in another vehicle when the suicide bomber attacked his motorcade. Chief Minister Raisani acts as an influential tribal leader, as well as a member of the country's ruling Pakistan Peoples Party. This bombing is the second such occasion, in which a senior government official has been attacked in the Balochistan Province. As Provincial Governor, Nawab Zulfiqar Magsi, managed to escape death or injury, after his convoy was struck by a roadside bomb in the Kalat district of the province earlier this month. The Balochistan Province has been the centre of a decade-long separatist insurgency and it is known that the Pakistani Taliban and other Radical Islamist militant groups operate within its provincial capital and northern districts. The Baloch Liberation Army, an insurgent group, later claimed responsibility for this suicide attack within the provincial capital city.\\"Suicide attack on Balochistan chief minister's convoy\\" BBC News, December 7, 2010\\"Police Constable injured in suicide attack on Balochistan Chief Minister's convoy succumbed to injuries\\" SATP, December 7, 2010 *8 December:- At least 19 people were killed and 25 others injured, after a suicide bomber detonated his explosives at a bus terminal in the main bazaar within the Pakistani town of Kohat, which is located in north-western Pakistan. It was later claimed by a police spokesman that the suicide bomber had approached the door of a bus, to which he had then set off his explosives. The bus was apparently carrying passengers to the nearby Orakzai Agency and it is known that many of those killed in this suicide blast were on board the bus itself. Of those 25 injured, it is known that some of them are seriously wounded and it has been reported that many shops within the nearby market were also damaged in this explosion. The remains of a boy suicide bomber, aged between 15-16 were later discovered, as the severed head and legs were found, according to Dilawar Bangash, the Kohat police chief for the local area. The Pakistani town of Kohat is located close to the Afghan-Pakistan border, where the Pakistani Taliban have a strong regional presence. These militant groups have carried out scores of suicide bomb attacks recently, despite Pakistan Army offensives against their strongholds within this particular region of the country. The banned radical Islamist group, Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, later claimed responsibility for this suicide attack within this particular town of Kohat, in north-western Pakistan.\\"Suicide bomb kills 16 at market in north-west Pakistan\\" BBC News, December 8, 2010\\"Suicide bomber kills 19 in Kohat market\\" DAWN NEWS TV, December 8, 2010 *10 December:- At least 16 people were killed and more than 20 others injured, after a suicide-car bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a hospital, which acted as a Shia Muslim-run facility within the district of Hangu, in north-western Pakistan. This suicide car-bomb explosion follows the start of Muharram, which acts as an Islamic holy month, especially most important for Pakistan's Shia minority. Local investigators within the area are claiming that this suicide attack was most likely a sectarian attack, perpetrated by Sunni militant groups, which often target the Shia minority during this holy month of Muharram. Witnesses at the scene later claimed that an explosive-laden tractor and trailer had rammed into the hospital whilst people were praying in a hall within this facility. It was also reported by Hangu police chief, Abdul Rashid, that some 250 kg or (550 lb) of explosive material was used to conduct the suicide attack. This particular suicide car bombing acts as the fourth major suicide attack in just this week across the country. Most of these suicide attacks, including this particular car bombing, have occurred within the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, of north-western Pakistan.\\"Suicide car bomber rams hospital in Hangu, Pakistan\\" BBC News, December 10, 2010\\"Hangu suicide blast: Death toll rises to 16\\" THE EXPRESS TRIBUNE, December 10, 2010 *13 December:- At least 2 people were killed and 4 others seriously injured, after a bomb explosion struck a school bus on Kohut road in the Bhana Marri area within the Pakistani city of Peshawar, which is located in north-western Pakistan. It was later reported that the bus driver and a 13-year-old boy were among the fatalities in this roadside bombing. Whereas it was reported that two girls of 13 and 6 years of age were apparently injured in this roadside bomb blast. The explosive device was apparently placed within a bin, similar to that which targets NATO forces in neighbouring Afghanistan. It is known that local police are examining the possibility that this bomb may have potentially missed or not hit its intended target, being that of police patrols that frequently pass this particular area. It was reported that the bus was hit by the blast near to a private school, which apparently ripped through the vehicle leaving charred wreckage and remains, as well as leaving a crater on the nearby ground. The north- western Pakistani city of Peshawar is located close to Pakistani Taliban heartland tribal regions, as well as the nearby Afghan-Pakistan border. Local correspondents claim that militants have regularly attacked schools, especially those of girls' schools, but usually when no children are present or around. Such bomb attacks within the city however are not uncommon as the city has been the scene of numerous such bomb attacks, including those which target Pakistani security facilities and government instillations.\\"Peshawar bomb kills teenage boy and bus driver\\" BBC News, December 13, 2010 *25 December:- At least 47 people were killed and over 100 others injured, after a female suicide bomber detonated her explosives in a large crowd of people displaced by fighting, who were collecting food at a distribution centre of the World Food Programme in the Pakistani town of Khar, which is located within the Bajaur tribal region, of north-western Pakistan.

Description  Acherontisuchus is known from six specimens UF/IGM 34 through 39 (Hastings et al. 2011 noted these six specimens may represent only a single animal), including three partial lower jawbones, four fragments of the upper jaw, fragments of 21 teeth, two ribs, one upper backbone segment, one sacral vertebra (a bone that connects the hips to the rest of the spine), ribs that attach to the sacral vertebrae, a partial hip including the ilium and ischium bones, an upper leg bone, and one metatarsal foot bone. All Acherontisuchus specimens were collected from the Cerrej√≥n Formation within the Cerrej√≥n coal mine of northeastern Colombia and described in 2011 in Palaeontology journal by Alexander K. Hastings, Jonathan Bloch and Carlos A. Jaramillo. It is named after the river Acheron, which in Greek mythology was a branch of the river Styx meaning \\"river of woe\\" (Acherontisuchus is thought to have lived in a large river that emptied out into the Caribbean Sea during the Paleocene). The type species A. guajiraensis is named after Guajira Peninsula where Cerrej√≥n is located. Acherontisuchus is found in multiple layers between coal seams, giving it a wide time distribution throughout the formation. Another dyrosaurid called Cerrejonisuchus was named from Cerrej√≥n in 2010, but is only found in one layer of the formation. Aside from the consistently fractured fossils, no evidence exists of an altered fossil size. Acherontisuchus is considered a long-snouted, or longirostrine, dyrosaurid. Its snout is shorter than those of Dyrosaurus, Atlantosuchus, Rhabdognathus, and Congosaurus. Some of its teeth have pronounced grooves on both sides. The upper jaw is wide rather than high. Its head is estimated to have been long, about midsize for a dyrosaurid. It grew to a relatively large size compared to most dyrosaurids, between .  Life history  Acherontisuchus lived in a calm, shallow, inland freshwater habitat in the tropical rainforests of northeastern Colombia, where its distant cousin Cerrejonisuchus lived as well. Most dyrosaurids, including the ancestors of Acherontisuchus, were well adapted to a coastal marine lifestyle. Like living crocodilians, these dyrosaurids were able to control their pitch and buoyancy in the water by contracting muscles that run between the abdomen and the hip. A projection of bone in the back of the hip called the ischial shaft serves as an anchor for the muscles that control pitch. Acherontisuchus has a slender ischial shaft, suggesting that the muscles that controlled its position in water were less developed. Oceanic dyrosaurids evolved an advanced system of pitch correction as an adaptation to rough ocean currents. Since Acherontisuchus lived in a shallow freshwater environment, it had less need to control its position. Based on the shape of its ribs and limb bones, Acherontisuchus probably had strong muscles along its back and in its legs that enabled movement on land. It probably lived in rivers that were present far from the ocean. In these inland rivers, Acherontisuchus most likely fed on lungfishes and eels.  Systematics  Acherontisuchus is closely related dyrosaurids from both Africa and the Americas. The phylogenetic analysis conducted with its first description placed Acherontisuchus in a derived clade of dyrosaurids that included Hyposaurus of North America, Congosaurus, Atlantosuchus, and Rhabdognathus of Africa, and Guarinisuchus of South America. The relationships between these dyrosaurids were not resolved, as Acherontisuchus was placed in a polytomy with Hyposaurus, Congosaurus, and a group containing the other close relatives. Acherontisuchus has several primitive features that distance it from other members of the derived dyrosaurid clade, including uniformly-spaced teeth and a wide connection between the two halves of the lower jaw.

During the War of 1812, Rust helped defend Baltimore, Maryland (where he later owned property and died), and rose to become a general in the Virginia militia, as well as the civilian superintendent of the arsenal at Harper's Ferry.  Early and family life  George Rust was born in Loudoun County, Virginia to George Rust (1760‚Äì1850) and Elizabeth Rust (ca. 1766‚Äì1844), and spent part of his childhood in Prince George's County, Maryland. He married Maria Claggett Marlow (d. 1863), and they had nine children, of which seven survived childhood, including Olivia Maria (d. 1844), Mary Virginia (d. 1826), Mary Virginia Rust Yellott (1830‚Äì1914), Col. Armistead Thomson Mason Rust (1820‚Äì1887), Col. George Thomas Rust (1826‚Äì1900), Margaret Rust Bedinger (1818‚Äì1843) and Charlotte Rust Rogers (1836‚Äì1923).  Career  During the War of 1812, Rust helped defend Baltimore, Maryland during the Battle of Baltimore. Loudoun County voters elected Rust as one of their two delegates in the Virginia House of Delegates in 1818‚Äì1819 (after George McCarty refused to take the oath required by the new Dueling Act) and he served along with experienced delegate Robert Braden. However, both were unseated in the 1919 election, and replaced by Fayette Ball and Stephen C. Roszel. While Ball was re-elected in 1820, so was Rust, and he was re-elected to the part-time position in the following two annual elections, serving until after the 1823 election, alongside William Chilton, then Robert Braden before Francis Stribling became the county's second delegate in the 1823 election. The Virginia General Assembly elected Rust as a brigadier general for the Virginia militia in 1824, hence his usual honorific. General Rust was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1828 (when he voted for Andrew Jackson) and again in 1852. Rust was appointed Superintendent of the U.S. Arsenal at Harper's Ferry in February 1830, and retired (still a civilian) from that post in March, 1837. In the middle of his term, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad reached the opposite shore. Rust also had business investments in Baltimore, including a hat and shoe store in the 1840‚Äì1846 and a bank in 1856. Rust built Rockland near Leesburg, Virginia about 1822. He also owned Exeter, a nearby plantation now destroyed. He and Albert Rust also bought \\"Indian Town\\", a plantation in Lancaster County, Virginia in 1856.  Death and legacy  General Rust died in Baltimore, Maryland on September 18, 1857, survived by his widow and several children and grandchildren. His remains were returned for burial in the Union Cemetery in Leesburg, Virginia. His papers are at the Library of Virginia. Other family papers are in collections of Leesburg's Thomas Balch Library, and in Arkansas. Several of Rust's relatives served in the Confederate Army or legislature during the American Civil War. His nephew and business partner Albert Rust, who had moved to Arkansas and became a legislator, rose to become a Confederate general and fought many battles in Virginia, as well as spent many of his later years there. George Rust's son Colonel Armistead Thomson Mason Rust (1820‚Äì1887), a West Point graduate, fought with the 19th Virginia Infantry and inherited Rockland. Another relative, Dr. George W. Rust, served as a physician in various Confederate Hospitals as well as in the Virginia House of Delegates and Virginia Constitutional Convention of 1868.

The southern end leads to Marine Parade, the Brighton seafront and the Palace Pier. The Old Steine is also the site of a number of City Centre bus stops for Brighton buses. The Royal Pavilion is located immediately to the north of the Old Steine.  History  The Old Steine was originally an open green with a stream running adjacent to the easternmost dwellings of Brighthelmstone. The area was used by local fishermen to lay out and dry their nets. When Brighton started to become fashionable in the late 18th century, the area became the centre for visitors. Building around the area started in 1760, and railings started to appear around the green area in the 1770s, reducing its size. This continued throughout the 19th century. The eastern lawns of the Royal Pavilion were also originally part of the Old Steine. Dr. Richard Russell, whose 1750 paper on the health benefits of sea water helped to popularise Brighton, had a house built on the Old Steine in 1759; the site is now occupied by the Royal Albion Hotel. Maria Fitzherbert lived in Steine House on the west side of the Old Steine from 1804 until her death in 1837. = Etymology = The word Steine comes from the Old English , meaning \\"stony place\\".

It therefore came as no surprise that the congregational council took special interest in the church Utzon had included in a competition exhibit for the town centre in Farum when it was displayed in Gladsaxe at an architectural exhibition in 1967. When he was asked whether he would like to submit a proposal for a church at Bagsv√¶rd, Utzon was elated: \\"There I stood, and was offered the finest task an architect can have ‚Äî a magnificent time when it was the light from above that showed us the way.\\"\\"J√∏rn Utzon, 2003 laureate, Biography\\" , PritzkerPrize.com.

It is achieved by means of high lateral windows across the entire width of the nave or, in the case of the smaller rooms, through sidelights bringing daylight in from the courtyards. In addition, there are extensive skylights which, in Utzon's words, result from \\"the inspiration that I derived from the drifting clouds above the sea and the shore [forming] a wondrous space in which the light fell through the ceiling ‚Äî the clouds ‚Äî down on to the floor represented by the shore and the sea.\\" Indeed, Utzon was inspired to design the church when he was lying on a Hawaii beach, shortly after his premature departure from Australia as a result of disagreements over the Sydney Opera House.Jones, Peter: Ove Arup: Masterbuilder of the Twentieth Century.

Assessments The architectural critic Kenneth Frampton considers Bagsv√¶rd Church an outstanding example of critical regionalism owing to the synthesis it achieves between universal and regional cultures.

It is one of the leading anti-poverty agencies working directly with over one million poor in Kenya. ActionAid Kenya employs a multi-dimensional approach in alleviating the poverty issue in Kenya, which involve the promotion and defence of human rights by improving access to education, food, water and medicine. Instead of direct monetary assistance, these services for the community would come under long-term sustainable programmes working for permanent change in Kenya. Ensure poor have access to medicine ActionAid Kenya actively campaign for lower prices and greater availability of anti-retroviral (ARV) drugs for the poor. It is part of the Kenya Coalition on Access to Essential Medicine (KCAEM), which is made of various NGOs campaigning for greater access to medicine. KCAEM was successful in campaigning for changes in legislature including the re-amendment of the Intellectual Property Act (IPA) in 2002 which allowed generic drugs to be imported for the treatment of HIV. Ensure basic rights for poor farmers Sugar cane is essential to Kenya's economy and the main contributors to sugar production are mostly small farmers. The farmers are often excluded from decision-making processes, hence leading to exploitation by the sugar companies. Kenya makes about ¬£24 million a year in revenue from sugar, but farmers are owed more than ¬£16 million in delayed payments. ActionAid realised the need for farmers to work together in order to increase their bargaining power and thus helped to set up Sugar campaign for change (SUCAM) in which the farmers were informed of their rights by ActionAid. In 2002, a new Sugar Bill was adopted and the first law to regulate the sugar industry comes intro act. This Bill states that 7 out of the 14 members of the Sugar Board must be elected farmer representatives, and farmers now have to be paid within 30 days of their crop being collected. SUCAM and ActionAid are continuing their efforts to lobby for the recognition of the rights and interests of farmers through national and international campaigns. The program will benefit the farmers in terms of timely payments and fair compensation for their sugar produce. Ensure equal rights for women and water sustainability for the community Women traditionally played a minimal role in development activities in Thakara. They were expected to do most of the household chores and would walk up to 15 km a day to collect drinkable water. Access to clean water was their main problem and ActionAid Kenya identified a local river as a potential source of piped water. After discussions with local community, Thakara Women Water Users Association (TWWUA) was formed and women were put in charge of the project reflecting their traditional role. Women were trained in management techniques, protection of the water supply, maintenance techniques and record keeping. This improved their confidence, self-esteem and power in the community. Eleven separate kiosk management committees were set up and 14,000 households now have easy access to clean water and remain free from water-borne diseases. Profits from the kiosks have been used to run further educational courses.

He has played in Ireland and in Austria. Butler played college basketball at Coastal Carolina University and was named the Big South Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year twice, in 2001 and 2003. College Butler is a 6'3\\", 205-pound small forward from Baltimore, Maryland and attended Mount Saint Joseph College. He then enrolled to play basketball for the Chanticleers of Coastal Carolina in 1998‚Äì99. Through his freshman and sophomore seasons, he averaged only 9.3 points and 3.2 rebounds per game. Then, as a junior in 2000‚Äì01, he jumped his season average to 19.4 points and 5.8 rebounds per game en route to being named the conference play of the year for the first time. He became the third player from Coastal Carolina to win the award behind Derek Wilson and Tony Dunkin. Butler's scoring average was the best in the Big South Conference and his 47.6% shooting from three-point range was the second best in the nation. The following year, in what would have been Butler's senior season, he was forced to sit out due to a medical redshirt. When he finally did return in 2002‚Äì03 for his belated final college season, he averaged 18.6 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. These averages were the second and sixth best in the conference, respectively. Butler repeated as the Big South Player of the Year and became just the third player in conference history to win the award multiple times (Dunkin was selected a national record four times, and UNC Asheville's Josh Pittman also won twice). Butler then went undrafted in the 2003 NBA Draft, which is considered one of the strongest NBA Draft classes in history. Professional After trying out with several NBA teams to try to make a roster, Butler then headed overseas to play professional basketball. His first stop was in Ireland to play for the UCC Demons. After several years he was traded to Allianz Swans Gmunden in Austria.

Originally, \\"Lucy Thinks Ricky Is Trying to Murder Her\\" was supposed to have been aired instead, as it was the first one filmed, but numerous production problems kept Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz and others, who had a stake in the success of the program, from airing it until the problems had been fixed. Instead, it was determined that \\"The Girls Want to Go to the Nightclub\\" was a better product to introduce the American public to their program. It debuted on CBS on Monday, October 15, 1951 at 9:00 pm. Plot summary It is the Mertzes' 18th wedding anniversary, and they and the Ricardos want to do something to celebrate. However, the gentlemen and the ladies have different ideas about what to do. Ricky (Desi Arnaz) and Fred (William Frawley) want to go to a boxing match, but Lucy (Lucille Ball) and Ethel (Vivian Vance) want to go to a nightclub. They argue and are unable to come to an accord. Finally, Lucy announces that she and Ethel will find dates to take them out. The men go downstairs to Fred's apartment where Ricky expresses concern about \\"what might happen\\" when the girls go out with other men. Fred agrees it would be a good idea to get dates themselves and go to the nightclub to keep an eye on their wives. Lucy tries calling up old boyfriends, but most of them are busy, married or, in one case, babysitting a grandson (Lucy explains that when she had dated this fellow, he was an \\"interesting older man\\"). Meanwhile, Ricky is in a similar situation, having burned his \\"little black book\\" upon marrying Lucy (she had told him that doing this was an American marriage tradition). Finally, Ricky decides to phone a friend, Ginny Jones, who has connections to all the women in town. She agrees to set them up. Lucy also remembers Ginny's connections and phones her for the same reason. Ginny lets Lucy in on the husbands' scheme, and Lucy has an idea. She tells Ginny to arrange dates for Ricky and Fred‚Äîbut with Ethel and herself. The evening comes around, and Ricky and Fred are anxiously waiting for their dates. The doorbell rings, and it's Lucy and Ethel, dressed in stereotypical hillbilly attire, and calling themselves \\"Eunice\\" and \\"Ma,\\" respectively. Ricky and Fred are shocked and don't realize it is their wives behind the costumes. Ricky is eventually tipped off when Lucy gives herself away by knowing exactly where the cigarettes and matches are. Ricky takes Fred aside, fills him in, and they turn the tables on the women by being overly amorous. Lucy realizes that Ricky knows what's up, and the charade is over. Later that evening finds the couples out celebrating the Mertzes' anniversary‚Äîat the fights. \\"Happy anniversary, Ethel\\", Lucy sighs. \\"Thank you, Lucy\\", Ethel sighs back.

This review is often performed in response to crisis, but may also be carried out as part of a demonstration project, in the process of taking a program to scale, or in the course of regular operations. Conducting a periodic detailed organizational analysis can be a useful way for management to identify problems or inefficiencies that have arisen in the organization but have yet to be addressed, and develop strategies for resolving them. Organizational analysis focuses on the structure and design of the organization and how the organization's systems, capacity and functionality influence outputs. Additional internal and external factors are also accounted for in assessing how to improve efficiency. Undertaking an organizational analysis is helpful in assessing an organization's current well-being and capacity, and deciding on a course of action to improve the organization's long-term sustainability. A restructuring of an Organization may become necessary when either external or internal forces have created a problem or opportunity for improvement in efficiency and effectiveness. When performing an organizational analysis, many details emerge about the functions and capacity of the organization. All of these details can make pinpointing what is efficient and inefficient difficult. Using theoretical organizational models can help sort out the information, and make it easier to draw connections. After working through these theoretical models, the organizations present situation is more adequately addressed, and the trajectory of the organization can be more fully determined. Organizational Analysis Models =Strategic Triangle Model= This model relies on three key calculations to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of an organization. First, is the value, or mission, that guides the organization. Second, is operational capacity, the knowledge and capability to carry out the mission. Third, is legitimacy and support, or the environment, that authorize the value of the organization, and offer support, (specifically financial support). Using this model, a strategy for an organization is considered good if these three components are in alignment. =SWOT model= A SWOT analysis (alternatively SWOT matrix) is a structured planning method used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats involved in a project or in a business venture. A SWOT analysis can be carried out for a product, place, industry or person. It involves specifying the objective of the business venture or project and identifying the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve that objective. The degree to which the internal environment of the entity matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of strategic fit. :* Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others. :* Weaknesses: characteristics that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others :* Opportunities: elements that the project could exploit to its advantage :* Threats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project First, the decision makers should consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. If the objective is not attainable a different objective must be selected and the process repeated. Users of SWOT analysis need to ask and answer questions that generate meaningful information for each category (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) to make the analysis useful and find their competitive advantage. =The McKinsey 7S Model= Visual representation of McKinsey 7S Framework. The McKinsey 7S Framework emphasizes balancing seven key aspects of an organization, operating unit, or project. Three of the seven elements‚Äîstrategy, structure, and systems‚Äîare considered \\"hard\\" elements, easily identified, described, and analyzed. The remaining four elements‚Äîshared value, staff, skill, and style‚Äîare fluid, difficult to describe, and dependent upon the actors within the organisation at any given time. The 7S organisational analysis framework is based on the premise that all seven elements are interdependent, and must be mutually reinforcing in order to be successful. Changes in a single element can result in misalignment and dysfunction throughout the organisation, disrupting organisational harmony. =Rational Model= The rational model stems from the Frederick W. Taylor's (1911) Structural Perspective. Taylor was the father of time-and-motion studies and founded an approach he called \\"scientific management.\\" It was Taylor's stance that organisations should be as mechanistic and efficient as possible. These Scientific Management principles served a valuable purpose for the Ford Motor Company, where the first American, mass-produced automobiles were being created. The rational model views organizations as a mechanism that is made up of various parts that can be modified in order to create an output in the shortest amount of time and without deviation. =Natural System Model= The natural system model is in many ways the opposite of the rational model in that it focuses on the activities that may negatively impact the organization and therefore aims at maintaining an equilibrium in order to meet its goals. The Natural System model views organizations as an organic organism which is holistically interconnected. The parts of the organization are not seen as independent units but rather as a whole that can orchestrate together to prepare for inevitable change. =Sociotechnical Model= The sociotechnical model, also known as Sociotechnical Systems (STS), is an approach to complex organizational work design that recognizes the interaction between people and technology in workplaces. The term also refers to the interaction between society's complex infrastructures and human behavior. This model identifies the environment as a key factor that interacts with the organization. =Cognitive Model= Behavior, cognitive, and other personal factors as well as environmental events, operate as interacting determinants that influence each other bidirectionally. Personal goals of the managers and staff are seen as assisting in the effort toward organizational objective attainment. Decision making processes are focused on and specialization is deemed as important to the flow of information. =Meta Models= Attempts have also been made to put elements of the above models into a kind of meta- model. Based on a theorized blindness of a single perspective, Lee Bolman and Terrence Deal have designed a model that splits analysis into four distinct paradigms. These 'frames' are to be used as a pluralistic model, and therefore allow analysts and leaders to change their thinking by re-framing understanding and points of reference. Bolman and Deal postulate that re- framing is a powerful way to think about situations in multiple ways, which is why taking a meta-model approach enables the development of alternative diagnoses and strategies. # Structural Frame Here organisations are to be understood by role definitions and clear hierarchy. Problems come from overlapping responsibilities and unclear instructions. The assumptions are similar to the rational model shown above and Taylorism. # Human Resource Frame According to this frame organisations exist to serve society, they are places for growth and development. Problems come from when people are not motivated or trained sufficiently. This is Similar to the Sociotechnical model, or the work of Daniel Pink. # Political Frame This frame posits that organisations are cutthroat jungles, where only the strongest survive. Problems come from poor power coalitions or overly centralized power. # Symbolic Frame This frame supposes that organisations are deeply symbolic and successful business is about the representation genuine meaning. Problems occur when actors fail to play their parts. Bolman and Deal lay out these frames in their book Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice and Leadership Bolman, L.G.; Deal, T.E. (2013) Reframing Organizations: Artistry, Choice, and Leadership. 5th Edition Jossey-Bass. the authors also provide many examples of how best to apply their four frames analysis. = Organizational Network Analysis = Organizational network analysis (ONA) is a method for studying communication within a formal organization to make invisible patterns of information flow and collaboration in strategically important groups visible. The method is applied by first mapping the relationships among people, tasks, groups, knowledge and resources of organizational systems. Then, analyzing the collected data with a social network analysis software in order to find organic clusters, opinion leaders, peripheral and bridging actors, indirect relations that are otherwise invisible. Organizational Strategies and Structure =Organizational Strategy= \\"An organization can be said to have a strategy when the leaders and the organization as a whole have committed themselves to a particular vision of how the organization will operate to create value and sustain itself in the immediate future\\" Evaluating or crafting an organizational strategy requires analysis of the relationship between mission, value and resources. Strategy allows managers to focus on an organization's long-term plan and ensure that mission objectives are met. Organizational strategy explores the relationship between unit and the environment. It involves action‚Äîmatching skills and resources with opportunities and threats. According to Michael Porter, a professor from Harvard Business School and leading expert in organizational strategy, the basics of a competitive model have Five Forces: * Threat of new entrants * Threat of substitute products or services * Bargaining power of customers * Bargaining power of suppliers * Intensity of competitive rivalry =Private and Public Strategy= Strategy can vary between public and private sectors. In the private sector the mission is to make money for stockholders, however in the public sector its mission is full-filling a social purpose or need. Measuring success is much harder in the public sector as it‚Äôs based on when a social need or issue has been full-filled. There is often no direct link between meeting mission and being sustainable. Sometimes a social value does not align with financial performance or organizational survival. =Organizational Structure= How an organization is structured depends on the coordinating mechanism used to produce the product or service. Think in terms of labor division for specific tasks and how authority is to be distributed among employees. Henry Mintzberg outlines five ways to consider labor division: * Simple Structure: Direct Supervision with little specialization * Machine Bureaucracy: Standardization of work with horizontal and vertical specialization * Professional Bureaucracy: Standardization of skills with horizontal specialization * Divisional Form: Standardization of outputs with some horizontal and vertical specialization (mainly between divisions) * Adhocracy: Mutual adjustments with much horizontal specialization Performance Management Performance management can be defined as 'an ongoing and continuous process of communicating and clarifying job responsibilities, priorities, and performance expectations in order to ensure understanding between supervisor and employee.' An important aspect of performance management involves designing specific measurable indicators as a means of gauging progress. Outcome indicators are not to be confused with actual outcomes, although both are pertinent to measuring progress. Outcome indicators are assigned a specific numerical measurement \\"that indicates progress toward achieving an outcome,\\" but are not the outcomes themselves. =Example of Indicators vs. Outcomes= Performance indicators are typically quantified, with measurable descriptors like ratio, incidence, proportion, or percentage, to demonstrate progress. When establishing progress between reporting periods, an indicator may also express measurement by using words such as the change in, or the difference to describe values for particular reporting periods. By contrast, an outcome might measure the 'number of cases correctly resolved during the time period or the percentage by which the number increased this reporting period as compared to the previous period.' Thus, if a transportation system outcome indicator measures the percentage of roads in good condition, the transportation system outcome would be that roads be in acceptable and durable condition. Performance measurement systems are often criticized for putting emphasis on indicators, at the expense of important outcome characteristics, which can lead to a misallocation of program funding resources and strategic endeavor. It is vital that indicators include a comprehensive set of outcomes that anticipate undesired ones. Examples of putting more emphasis on indicators than outcomes, include a law enforcement agency focusing solely on the number of police arrests, or a tax agency focusing solely on amount of dollars collected. Such laser focus creates a perverse incentive that might 'tempt staff to harass individual citizens [and] [businesses] to increase these values,' giving way to unintended consequences. Lastly, comprehensiveness is contingent upon measurement of resources available, as well as any existing data problems. =Challenging Outcomes to Measure= *Prevention Programs- (How does one measure the number of incidences prevented?) *Basic Research and long range planning activities- (Outcomes may take years to surface) *Programs with anonymous customers- (Ex: Hotlines) *Programs in which major outcomes apply to a very small number of events =Control Systems in the Workplace= Companies encourage independence and innovation among employees in order to remain competitive, but in an effort to avoid unnecessary risk and control failures, companies must also put in place mechanisms to monitor employee progress. Included here are four major types of control levers or systems that enable managers to reconcile employee autonomy with effective control. * Diagnostic Control Systems- Building and supporting clear targets * Belief Systems- Communicating company core values and mission * Boundary Systems- Specify and enforce rules of the game * Interactive Control Systems- Open organizational dialogue to encourage learning Contracting-Out and Collaboration When organizations (usually in the public sector) do not have the internal capacity to complete their mission contracting-out occurs. An analysis of the capacities, the contract or agreement, and the relationship between collaborating stakeholders is conducted. Analysis of contracting-out and/or collaborations can ensure goals are met successfully prior to the beginning of a partnership, and correct inefficiencies throughout the time frame of the collaboration. The analysis should examine collaboration in three categories: capacity, the agreement, and the relationship. When analyzing the capacities of the collaborating organizations, examine the contractor‚Äôs capacity to deliver and meet contract service requirements. Explore the history of work and past successes as well as the financial standing of the contractor. The organization that is contracting out should have the ability (now and in the future) for monitoring, knowing when the contractor has fulfilled the contract, and for capacity building. An analysis of the agreement, or contract, should look for several indicators of future success. The contract should be compatible with the mission statements of the collaborating organizations. Adequate funding for completion of the contract is necessary. Outcome definitions and measures must be clear. A realistic time line should be present with a plan in place for handling potential set-backs. An agreed upon system for feedback throughout the collaboration should be built into the agreement. The relationship between collaborating organizations is important to consider. Alignment of collaborating organizations' cultures is a significant and often overlooked element of contracting-out. Alignment of the values, mission, communication style, and outcome measurements increase the likelihood of a successful collaboration. Cooperation and Coalitions =Analysis of multiple organizations= Organizational analysis can analyze a single organization and its internal functioning as well as a coalition of actors in collaboration for a certain goal. Such collaboration can be analyzed for inter-actor cooperation, information sharing and capacity. A good example is \\"Organizational analysis of maternal mortality reduction program in Madagascar\\" by Harimanana, Barennes and Reinharz. This study used the Gamson‚Äôs Coalition Theory and Hining & Greenwood‚Äôs archetypes to assess the misalignment of the process by which several agencies including the Madagascar health Ministry provide prenatal services and information to women in Madagascar. Their results show several problems. Incongruity among actors disperses the services and therefore makes it difficult for women to access support. Cultural inconsistencies and failure to recognize social context, diminishes the cooperation and effectiveness of the actors. Also, the Madagascar health ministry needs basic materials and funding to provide adequate services to women. Additionally, Cumbersome directives created inefficiencies. The Analysis of the information indicated that the Madagascar Ministry of Health is a poor leader of this effort, the programs did not translate well on the local level and the different actors did not cooperate well. The study also identified capacity limits in health care but due to the misalignment and uncooperative actors, the NGO‚Äôs did not properly address the lack of capacity. This study demonstrates a complex organizational analysis. The multiple aspects of the misalignment hampered information flows. In addition, inter-actor misunderstanding increased the inefficiencies of the program. This analysis could help the functioning of the program in the future. Organizational Analysis Examples =Reflective Practitioner Model: Washington D.C. School System= In the early 2000s, the Washington D.C. public schools faced an organizational crisis. Mayor Adrian Fenty sought advice to determine what was the best way to effectively improve the Washington D.C. public schools. Fenty employed Michelle Rhee as the school district superintendent. Rhee initiated her job by analyzing all the factors that affected the school district. After evaluating all the factors Rhee decided to restructure the district. Rhee set defined metrics in order to hold teachers accountable and measure whether they were reaching goals. Rhee wanted to eliminate tenure for teachers in order to increase teacher accountability. Rhee wanted to increase the school district's efficiency, and believed that restructuring the teachers would achieve this. The process and results were controversial but illustrate an organizational approach to overcoming a policy crisis.Winig, Laura. \\"1957.0 Michelle Rhee and the Washington D.C. Public Schools.\\"John F. Kennedy School of Government.2012. Harvard Kennedy School. 20 Sep. 2012 . =Strategic Triangle Model OK: Casa de Esperanza= In 1982, a group of women formed a shelter in St. Paul, Minnesota to address the needs of Latina women in the community that were victims of domestic violence. Casa de Esperanza immediately reached capacity, but the majority of occupants were Caucasian and African-American women. The Board of Directors was surprised to realize that very few women from the Latina community were utilizing the shelter. Casa de Esperanza continued to serve women from all backgrounds, and received government stipends for their work. The organization strove to be multicultural, while also maintaining the same mission of empowering Latinas. Many of the staff members identified with the mission of helping all women, while the Board of Directors maintained their stance on specifically helping Latinas. The theoretical model of the, \\"strategic triangle,\\" can be applied in order to better understand the organizational challenges of Casa de Esperanza. The mission and capacity of the organization are misaligned due to a few key factors. The mission of the organization is vague and overly broad, which led the staff and Board to develop opposing views of the mission. Most importantly, they could not agree on who their target demographic was. The organization‚Äôs capacity is rooted in helping women from all backgrounds with a variety of services, while the mission seems to indicate they serve Latina women predominantly. The environment suggests that there is a need amongst a broader population than just Latina women. In addition, the government is the main source of funding for the organization and they are failing at financial sustainability. In order to bring these three components into alignment, the organization would need to make a clear and specific mission statement, tailor their capacity to reach that mission, and look for alternate forms of funding. Other recommendations could be made using the strategic triangle model. The model is a useful tool to examine the organizations in a crisis situation. =Organizational Structure and Operations Model: New York City Transit Authority= In the 1990s, the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA) was having problems with sustainability. There was a steep decline in ridership coupled with an increase in riders who avoided paying the fare. There was an increase in crime in the subways, as well as more homeless and panhandlers congregating in the stations. When Alan Kiepper became the head of the NYCTA, he decided to restructure the organization, and place more of a focus on stations. Kiepper believed that New Yorkers would regain trust in the Transit Authority if they saw crime decline and repercussions for fare avoidance. Therefore, Kiepper used the organizational structure model to improve the organization's efficiency. Stations were given station managers who were responsible for overseeing all problems within the station. The previous division of labor was broken down, and employees began to work across departments in order to improve the stations. This is an example of focusing on an organization's structure while performing an organizational analysis.

DeGioia with the development of new projects and led Georgetown's institutional positioning, communications, government relations, community relations, and intercollegiate athletics. He spearheaded Georgetown's relationship with Teach For America, the KIPP Foundation, the D.C. public schools, and the Cristo Rey Network. He also served as interim director of Georgetown's NCAA Division I athletics program from June 2009 to April 2010. = Franklin & Marshall College = On Nov. 16, 2010, the Franklin & Marshall College board of trustees announced its selection of Porterfield to serve as the college's 15th president. Porterfield began his tenure at F&M; on March 1, 2011 and was inaugurated on Sept. 25, 2011. In his inaugural address, titled \\"Kindle Fire,\\" Porterfield spoke about the core purposes and values of a liberal arts education, the traditions of Franklin & Marshall and the power of ideas and knowledge. \\"It is imperative that we at F&M; and all liberal arts colleges embrace the idea that we can be high-impact forces for the long-term good in the world,\\" Porterfield said. \\"Liberal arts education is the single finest form of cultivating emerging human talent and character that this world has ever known.\\" Porterfield's strategies led F&M; to enroll some of the most talented and diverse classes in its history. The percentage of incoming Pell Grant-eligible students and domestic students of color tripled during his tenure. Porterfield and F&M; attributed these results to a doubling of need-based financial aid for the first-year class over that time period and to a strategy of targeted outreach to promising students in underserved communities. As he did at Georgetown, Porterfield forged new partnerships between F&M; and K-12 educators and access programs including the Posse Foundation, the KIPP Foundation, Achievement First, Uncommon Schools, Noble, College Match, College Track, the College Advising Corps and Cristo Rey Network. While serving at F&M;, he joined the board of the College Board and chaired the board of the Lenfest Scholars Foundation, a Philadelphia-based scholarship and college access organization. He also sat on the Teach For America University Champions' Board and the College Advising Corps Advisory Board. In 2011, Porterfield created a highly regarded pre-college summer program, F&M; College Prep, to allow more than 70 rising seniors from low-income communities to spend three weeks learning from F&M; faculty and current students. He also absorbed F&M;'s career center into a comprehensive Office of Student & Post-Graduate Development, an effort that gained national attention for its innovative approach to transitioning students into successful lives after college. Under Porterfield's leadership, F&M; also set records for applications, fundraising, and fellowships; developed cutting edge new centers for student wellness and faculty excellence; constructed a new athletics stadium; and embarked upon the process of building a groundbreaking new visual arts center designed by world-renowned architect Steven Holl. The KIPP Foundation honored Porterfield in 2012 with its ‚ÄúBeyond Z‚Äù award, which ‚Äúcelebrates members of the school community who go above and beyond for the benefit of children,‚Äù and the ‚ÄúI Have A Dream‚Äù Foundation presented him with its Eugene M. Lang Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014. In 2016, Porterfield was named a Champion of Change for College Opportunity by the White House. In 2013, Porterfield took part as a panelist discussing ‚ÄúA Path to Higher Ed‚Äù on NBC News‚Äô Education Nation, and was the only liberal arts college president invited to speak at the three White House summits focusing on college opportunity hosted by the Obama administration in 2014. Porterfield and F&M; received national recognition and visibility for their work to expand educational opportunity, including high-profile coverage in The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Philadelphia Inquirer, and The Chronicle of Higher Education, and on the PBS NewsHour. They also led the creation of the American Talent Initiative (ATI), an alliance of top colleges and universities funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and staffed by the Aspen Institute and the research organization Ithaka S+R with a national goal of enrolling 50,000 more high-achieving low-income students in leading institutions by 2025. In 2019, F&M; faced deep budget cuts attributed to tuition discounting practices instituted during Porterfield's presidency.Rick Seltzer, \\"F&M; Sticks to Admissions Policy Even as Budget Cuts Loom,\\" Inside Higher Ed, February 14, 2019, https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/02/14/franklin-marshall-college- looks-close-6-percent-budget-gap = The Aspen Institute = The Aspen Institute named Porterfield to succeed author and journalist Walter Isaacson as its next president and CEO on November 30, 2017. He assumed the position on June 1, 2018. In one of his early public appearances as President and CEO, Porterfield described the Aspen Institute as ‚Äúa force for good in communities near and far; convening thinkers and leaders; bringing into contact the very best ideas; framing and helping to solve the great difficulties of the day; confronting challenges from which others turn away; investing in leaders of every type; and always ensuring that questions of ethics and values and meaning have a prominent place in our conversations and our society.‚Äù Under Porterfield, the Institute has launched new initiatives focused on criminal justice reform, science and society, economic inclusion, grassroots and community leadership, and more. In the Roaring Fork Valley of Colorado, where the Institute was founded and where it maintains its Aspen Meadows campus, it has broadened its partnerships with the local community and deepened its connection with its aesthetic and cultural heritage through the creation of a $20 million educational facility and creativity corridor celebrating the works of Bauhaus master Herbert Bayer, one of the founders of the Institute. In 2019, the Institute created the Aspen Partnership for an Inclusive Economy (APIE) with a founding partner, the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth, and a $26 million multi-year commitment from Mastercard. Through APIE, the Institute brings together its networks and programs with a diverse range of public, private, and nonprofit leaders to help reconstruct the global economy so that it drives greater security, opportunity, and resilience for all.  Personal  Porterfield is married to Karen A. Herrling, an attorney. They have three children.

He is best known for his oft- quoted poem \\"Death and his brother sleep\\", notably quoted by Winston Churchill in the prelude to World War II when he felt that parliament was not taking the prospect of a war against Hitler seriously enough. He produced a series of comic poems published as The 'Arry Papers between 1874 and 1897. He worked as journalist on the London Figaro in 1872 and joined Punch in 1877. His creation of 'Arry, a bombastic Cockney, resulted in a successful series of poems which were hailed for their phonetic precision. Milliken described 'Arry as \\"really appalling. He is not a creature to be laughed at or with.\\" In 1883 he published The Modern Ars Amandi. 'Arry at Stonehenge Milliken's first association with Punch occurred on 2 January 1875 with a few lines entitled \\"A Voice from Venus\\", that planet's transit having just taken place. This was his first contribution and, since he was a newcomer, he was asked for an assurance that he was indeed the author. From then on his contributions were regular and he was welcomed to the staff in early 1877. Milliken was trained for, and spent the beginning of his career, with a large engineering firm. The literary world, though, was always his first love and his contributions to a few magazines and journals initially satisfied this bent.

The declaration was developed to create sustainable designs and human-centered societies, through collaboration of institutions, business‚Äô and individuals.  Background  Yrjo Sotamaa (Finnish designer with an MA in Interior Architecture and furniture design) was the author of the design declaration and past president of Cumulus. Yrjo Sotamaa‚Äôs career was based on building a sustainable future and the importance of art, design and the mythologies of design involved, which enable such creative societies and designs to be developed. The Association Cumulus is described as an international network of universities, colleges, organizations and business partners all incorporated in the topic areas of art, design and media. Allowing for academic and corporate collaboration. Cumulus has expanded and improved in status over the past decade leading it to become a successful international organization representing a global community of 140 first-class institutions worldwide.  History and the evolution of the design declaration  Cumulus was set up in 1990 by the combined efforts of ‚ÄòThe University of Art and Design Helsinki (UIAH) (currently Aalto University School of Art and Design) and the Royal College of Art in London, collaborating with Danmarks Designskole, Gerrit Rietveld Academie, Universit√§t Gesamthochschule Essen and Hochschule f√ºr angewandte Kunst in Wien. The organizations focus is on enhancing academic forward designs and generating creative communities connecting the continents. This is described by the declarations author-Yrjo Sotamaa, as a ‚Äòmission to make societies and industry aware of the importance of culture, art, and design in building sustainable societies, creative economies, innovative regions and a better everyday life for all people.‚Äô (journal article)This attitude is what brought about the declaration and members of Cumulus continue to work by the declarations approach.  Objectives  The Kyoto design declarations main aim is highlighted by their statement of commitment from the members of Cumulus, to act on being globally responsible for building sustainable, human-centered, creative societies. The Kyoto Design Declaration suggests that it is important, globally, to maintain and continue local or traditional practices.

The Kyoto design declaration is a mark of the shift in movement from materialistic and visible values to a more intellectual and mental approach towards all aspects of design. The declaration describes this as an era of ‚Äòcultural productivity‚Äô and when embedded with cultural influences and sustainable principles there is a great potential for an improved world through design society. Sotamaa delivers the declaration to provide benefits to our global communities in the form of economic, ecological, social and cultural benefits which will endeavor to improve quality of life through design durability.  Designers Involvement  Through notions of the declaration designers are made aware of ecological and social problems in the field of global development and sustainable design. This presents issues to address for design matters of education and research. ‚ÄòThe declaration challenges design to redefine itself‚Äô- Yrjo Sotamma. The implementation of the declaration is clarified and kept up to date through annual sustainability reports available through the Cumulus website. Information includes actions taken by the association regarding the dealings and goals, which are set out in the declaration. There are six subheadings, which outline and shape the declaration. The subheadings divide the declaration into categories for the designers and other professional businesses and institutional collaborations to follow and comprehend. -Proposing new values and new ways of thinking -An era of human centered development -The imperative for designers to assume new roles -Seeking collaboration in forwarding the ideals of sustainable development -From education to global responsibility -The power to make fundamental improvements to our world  Success and results  When signed in 2008 by the 124 global members of cumulus including the executive Board of Cumulus, President Christian Guellerin, Past President Yrj√∂ Sotamaa, Rector Kan Shimamoto, Kyoto Seika University, and Industrial Designer Takuo Hirano from Japan.

Cumulus now consists of 165 members from 43 countries. Continuously expanding globally and intellectually. A direct result from the Kyoto design declaration is the cumulus green award. It is through this award that Cumulus is able to take action of the goals and aims stated in the design document. The projects intentions are to induce a response to design issues on sustainable societies through research and design projects. Design competitions are an example of how the declaration is put into place. This is through design competitions that question and discuss the current design issues to do with sustainability. Enforcing designers, students and corporate professionals to follow the guidelines of the Kyoto declaration enhancing their knowledge on the declarations main statement of building sustainable, human-centered, creative societies. The Kyoto design declaration is seen as influential to many realms and institutions of design. Examples are seen across the globe. Helsinki is the origin of the Cumulus secretariat. The University of Art and Design Helsinki (TAIK) pioneered in the development of the Kyoto declaration, committing to educate sustainable issues. In order to create a successful global community the Mayor of Helsinki, (Jussi Pajunen) stated in his World Design Capital 2012 application that his city will use all means presented by design- in the spirit of the Kyoto Declaration.

The country is bordered on the north by Georgia and Iran to the south; Azerbaijan and Republic of Artsakh in the east, Turkey in the west. A 1994 map of the Caucasus region, including the locations of valuable resources shared by the many states in the area: alunite, gold, chromium, copper, iron ore, mercury, manganese, molybdenum, lead, tungsten, zinc, oil, natural gas, and coal.  Economic conditions in Armenia  Located in the Caucasus region between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, Armenia has a highly educated workforce and the Government of Armenia officially welcomes foreign investment. With a population of approximately 3 million, Armenia has a relatively small domestic market. Armenia's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union in 2014 opened markets of large countries like Russia and Kazakhstan for Armenian products. In 2017, Armenia ratified the Armenia-EU Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement, further developing trade and political relations between Armenia and the European Union. Various issues typical for a developing economy are exacerbated by Armenia's poor geographic location and by ongoing blockade through Turkey and Azerbaijan.  High transportation cost  As a landlocked country with no direct access to main shipping routes, Armenia must trade across borders to reach major world markets in North America and Europe in order to maintain sustainable economic growth and development. Cross-border trading, however, incurs higher transaction costs and reduces competitiveness and trade volume. In Armenia, poor existing physical infrastructure such as roads and railways compounds this problem by further raising the risk and cost of transport. Much of Armenia's infrastructure was built during the Soviet period and is in need of repair and renovation.  Vulnerabilities to external shocks  Most landlocked countries are vulnerable to external shocks due to their dependence on neighboring countries and Armenia is no exception. Poor ties with Turkey and Azerbaijan only serve to strengthen Armenia's dependence on Georgia and Russia. It imports nearly all of its refined petroleum products through Georgia and most of its energy fuel from Russia. The 2008 South Ossetia War between Russia and Georgia resulted in disruption to fuel and food imports.

It aims to increase transparency and create a corruption-free world by working together with the private sector, civil society and public sector. Corruption is rife and a major issue in Slovakia. TIS focuses on policies involving local and regional governments to uphold democracy and a free market economy.  Case study: Privatisation of Slovak Telecom (1999‚Äì2000)  = Background of corruption in Slovakia = Under the previous heavily corrupted governance (1994‚Äì1998), privatization was not a transparent process, leading to many cases of embezzlement. Many private firms were sold at a loss, leading some to bankruptcy and causing negative fiscal impact on the Slovak economy. With the change to a new governance in October 1998, TIS was invited to monitor and increase the transparency level of the privatization process of Slovak Telecom and ultimately, reduce corruption. = Goals of the project = The main goals of the monitoring of the privatization process of Slovak Telecom in which Transparency International Slovakia participated as an independent observer were: # to observe the process in order to increase transparency and minimize the possibility of corruption # to raise awareness of the general public about corruption and transparency issues in Slovakia, especially in privatization and public procurement tenders. = Actions taken by TIS = TIS sought to improve transparency of the process by first forming a tri-party which, together with TIS, helped monitor the entire process, thereby increasing transparency. Observing the process also allowed TIS to brainstorm ideas that would improve transparency. For instance, a major problem identified was with regard to the documentation language. Documents are written only in English, a language of which command is imprecise, hence leaving the document open to interpretation. In addition, TIS published news and information on the privatisation to educate and increase public awareness on transparency issues. = Results of the changes = Through the media, TIS managed to increase public interest and awareness on issues concerning transparency and anti-corruption. The extent of public participation and media influence was exemplified during the process, through public outcry against corruption that led to the resignation of two corrupt officials, the first of its kind in the country. Realizing the need for a greater transparency level in the privatization process, TIS established and recommended numerous policies for administrative changes. These included: * ‚ÄúPrivatization Information Minimum‚Äù * ‚ÄúPublic Procurement Information Minimum‚Äù * Amendment of the Law on Public Procurement * Working Group on Public Procurement  Post- evaluation statistics  According to two reports, the progress of corruption in Slovakia remains unclear. World Bank statistics show that in the period after the policy implementation, corruption in Slovakia worsened from 0.31 in 2000 to 0.13 in 2002, thereafter the corruption index showed a general upward trend of an increase of the index by 0.3 points by 2008. On the other hand, Transparency International statistics show that after 2000, corruption has been steadily decreasing in the country from 3.5 in 2000 to 4.98 in 2008 signaling a decrease by 1.48 index points.

Military spending includes expenses for military and civil personnel, the retirement pensions for army personnel as well as social services, all the military operations and programmes and maintenance of the same, military aid and lastly military research and development. As we have seen earlier the United States of America is incurring the highest military expenditure in the world. It is considered a superpower and a determinant of the world's military spending. Their spending in the recent times has increased due to terror and Afghanistan and Iraq invasions. Even though there have been financial crises the military expenses have shown no signs of change. The expenditure on a country's armed forces remains the same.

He ran a British research consultancy, Drylands Research. He is best known for an anti-Malthusian account of population-environment relationships, More People, Less Erosion, and field-based studies of adaptation to drought.http://www.drylandsresearch.org.uk/ Background Mortimore's father worked for Cable & Wireless plc and as a result, Mortimore was born in Bermuda and educated on Ascension Island, before boarding at Monkton Combe School in Somerset when his father was posted to Aden. He attended the University of Leeds (BA Geography 1960, MA 1962) where he met his wife, Julia. He left the UK in 1962 to become a lecturer in Nigeria. He was involved in building Nigeria's capacity to train and support its own interdisciplinary research into human-environmental dynamics. He first taught and researched at Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, between 1962 and 1979, during which time he trained many students, built a map library, and edited the journal Savanna. He was then Professor of Geography at the relatively new Bayero University, Kano, from 1979 to 1986. He then left Nigeria, preceded by his family, after religious extremism in Kano that targeted Christians. Subsequently, he continued research studies as a Senior Research Associate in the Department of Geography, University of Cambridge, the Overseas Development Institute in London, and as an Honorary Fellow of the Centre of West African Studies, University of Birmingham. He was a partner of a policy consultancy set up with Mary Tiffen in the 1990s, Dryland Research. He was an Honorary Senior Fellow at the University of Melbourne, Australia. He was a consultant for DFID, CIFOR, the UNCCD, DANIDA, the Natural Environment Research Council, and the Drylands Development Centre in Kano. He was a frequent visitor to Nigeria, latterly in 2016. Research contributions Mortimore is known for his extensive studies of farming systems, environmental change and human adaptation to drought in the drylands of northern Nigeria, and comparative work in Kenya, Niger, and Senegal. He assessed local and regional human adaptations to a harsh and complex environment. Mortimore produced several influential and thought provoking texts; these include Adapting to Drought (1989), Working the Sahel (with W.M. Adams, 1999) and a revisionist account of livelihoods in Machakos, Kenya entitled More People, Less Erosion (with M Tiffen and F Gichuki, 1994). Mortimore's research and publications were all concerned with the drylands of Africa. Adapting to Drought was a summation of his long-held view that even the most disadvantaged African smallholders 'adapt' more or less successfully to climatic change and severe drought, rather than submitting to it. It was based on first-hand, blow-by-blow observation over 25 years, and particularly of the Sahelian famines and droughts of the late 1970s and 1980s. Wood fuel in Kano (with Reg Cline-Cole et al.) was an exhaustive study of the fuelwood market also conducted in the late 1980s following the major droughts. One project Mortimore undertook from the UK in the 1990s was conducted with Prof. Bill Adams (Cambridge) and Nigerian colleagues, and using ESRC funding. It brought his earlier Nigeria research up to date and extended it through new field studies in the region, presenting a model of how agropastoralists deal with environmental and economic pressures in the region (see Working the Sahel, 1999). From 1991, Mortimore embarked on a major project with Mary Tiffen and Francis Gichuki, in the Machakos Hills of Kenya. This region was long held to have suffered serious erosion accompanied by population growth. The researchers ‚Äì after securing funding from a variety of sources ‚Äì set about testing population- environment models and relationships. Leaning on (and improving on) Ester Boserup's work, they discovered population growth and environmental enhancement occurred thorough multicropping and other farming methods, terracing, and strong community organisations. Mortimore's comparisons of photographs from 1930 and 1990 revealed an improvement in landscapes and in resource management (rather than degradation and impoverishment, widely assumed to have been present), albeit with much higher population densities and altered labour regimes. This finding 'controverted' Malthusian thinking. The 1993 launch of More People, Less Erosion at the ODI in London was electric ‚Äì several staff members of the UK Department for International Development, the World Bank, and academic researchers from East Africa were there, and the study has echoed through revisionist thinking about African degradation myths and agrarian policy ever since. It remains a controversial and talked-about thesis on African development paths.see Malakoff, D. 2011. Are More People Necessarily a Problem?

He was a long-term critic of the argument that the Sahara is 'spreading' as a result of poor land management, or that farmers and herders tend towards destroying their natural capital. In Adapting to Drought he challenged the well-funded international desertification apparatus and challenged it to listen to farmers who, with the right support, were improving biodiversity and halting land degradation without expensive and inappropriate interventions. Almost two decades later, and following interest in the Machakos model, he was actually engaged by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification to make this case to them (Mortimore 2005).

It is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects the behaviour of its inhabitants, with the aim of maximising the positive effects of this relationship. Through interior design psychology the performance and efficiency of the space and the wellbeing of the individual are improved. Figures like Walter Benjamin, Sigmund Freud, John B. Calhoun and Jean Baudrillard have shown that by incorporating this psychology into design one can control an environment and to an extent, the relationship and behaviour of its inhabitants. An example of this is seen through the rat experiments conducted by Calhoun in which he noted the aggression, killing and changed sexual tendencies amongst rats. This experiment created a stark behavioural analogy between the rat‚Äôs behaviour and inhabitation in high-rise building projects in the US after WWII, an example of which is the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis demolished in 1972 only 21 years after being erected. Proxemics Proxemics study the amount of space people feel necessary to have between themselves and others. =Crowding and personal space= In this field of study, the phenomenon of territoriality is demonstrated continuously through unwritten indices and behaviours, which communicate, the conscious or subconscious notions of personal space and territoriality. This phenomenon is seen, for example, through the use of public seating and the empty seats on a crowded bus or train. ‚Äú Crowding occurs when the regulation of social interaction is unsuccessful and our desires for social interaction are exceeded by the actual amount of social interaction experienced.‚Äù Studies observing social behaviours and psychology have indicated, such as in the case for commuters that people will seek to maximise personal space whether standing or sitting. In a study conducted by Gary W. Evans and Richard E. Wene, (who work within the field of environmental design and human development) of 139 adult commuters, commuting between New Jersey and Manhattan, (54% male) saliva samples were taken to measure cortisol levels, a hormonal marker of stress. Their research accounts statistically for other possible stressors such as income and general life stress. ‚ÄúWe find that a more proximal index of density is correlated with multiple indices of stress wherein a more distal index of density is not.‚Äù Concerns arising from the results of this study suggest that small deviations in increased seat density, controlled against income stress, would elevate the log of cortisol (i.e. stress levels) and diminish task performance and mood. = Relationships between people = Closely related to the proxemics of space, in the area of privacy. In ‚ÄúPerspectives on Privacy‚Äù P. Brierley Newell from the department of psychology at the University of Warwick, Coventry defines privacy as ‚Äòa voluntary and temporary condition of separation from the public domain.‚Äô The desire for privacy is often identified as a link between stress and distress. The ability to obtain privacy within an environment allows the individual to separate themselves physically and mentally from others and relax. This notion is of key importance in determining the behaviour and wellbeing of the individual. As above in the scenario of crowding and density on public transport, privacy dictates perception of comfort, in relation to crowding and personal space. Dissatisfaction with one‚Äôs environment can be related to the close proximity with others, leading to stress and as a result diminish mood and performance behaviours.. = Defensible space = This theory began development in 1962 when John B. Calhoun conducted a series of experiments on rats to study population density and social pathology. From these experiments a breeding utopia was established for the rats in which they only lacked space. ‚ÄúUnwanted social contact occurred with increasing frequency, leading to increased stress and aggression. Following the work of the physiologist, Hans Selye, it seemed that the adrenal system offered the standard binary solution: fight or flight. But in the sealed enclosure, flight was impossible. Violence quickly spiralled out of control. Cannibalism and infanticide followed. Males became hypersexual, pansexual and, an increasing proportion, homosexual. Calhoun called this vortex ‚Äúa behavioural sink‚Äù. Their numbers fell into terminal decline and the population tailed off to extinction‚Äù This study linked population growth, environmental degradation and urban violence. Similar behavioural tendencies became apparent within the poor housing conditions at the Pruitt-Igoe development in St Louis. This development is now used as a key study of inhabitation by architects and urban planners, Oscar Newman one of the main developers of this field, references the observations of inhabitation at this establishment in his book Creating Defensible Space. He notes the stark difference between private space, which is clearly defined personal territory, and the public space in this development. He notes that public spaces shared by relatively few families compared to those shared by many were much more hygienic and well-looked after, whereas those shared by larger numbers were often vandalized and unhygienic. He comments that the anonymity created by these largely shared public corridors and spaces ‚Äúevoked no feelings of identity or control‚Äù This indicates our relationship with space affects our behaviour and use of space. In this example lack of feelings of ownership of the space led to negative behaviour within space and furthermore created a feedback with negative effects on the wellbeing of the inhabitants.  The perception of space  This perception can otherwise be termed as awareness between our bodies and the awareness of other bodies, organisms and bodies around us. Perceived beauty and personal involvement within an environment are key factors, which determine our perception of space. As defined in the Measurement of Meaning by Osgood, Suci and Tannebaum the factors influencing the perception of space are these 3 things: 1\\\\. Evaluation- including the aesthetic, affective and symbolic meaning of space 2\\\\. Power- the energy requirements to adapt to a space 3\\\\. Activity- links to the noise within a space and the worker‚Äôs relationship and satisfaction with job and task In \\"Effects of the self-schema on perception of space at work\\" by Gustave Nicolas Fischer, Cyril Tarquinio, Jacqueline C. Vischer, the study conducted linking design and psychology in the workplace. In this study they proposed a theoretical model linking environmental perception, work satisfaction and sense of self in a feedback loop. This is shown below in Fig. 1, to illustrate their findings on the direct relationship the environment has with the inhabitant and how through psychology this affects behaviour. (Awaiting copyright approval) There is also something to be said about the way our increasingly popular open office designs may contribute to less productivity and higher distractions, versus traditional cubicle-like work spaces. According to an article from Fortune, \\"Evidence is mixed on whether open plans actually foster collaboration, and studies have shown that open office plans decrease productivity and employee well-being while increasing the number of sick days workers take. [...] A study by the architecture and design firm Gensler found that workers in 2013 spent 54 percent of their time on work requiring individual focus, up from 48 percent in 2008.\\" In order to combat this, future offices in our next generations will include sound-proof private rooms giving workers the opportunity to work solo without distraction, cubicle banks and private offices while continuing to sustain the open floor plan.  The System of Objects  Developed by Jean Baudrillard as part of his sociology doctorate thesis Le Syst√®me des objets (The System of Objects). In this he proposed the 4 object valuing criteria, these being: # Function ‚Äì a pen is used to write # Exchange or economic value ‚Äì a piano being worth three chairs # Symbolic ‚Äì an amethyst symbolising a birth in February # Sign ‚Äì the branding or prestige of an object, with no added function being valued over another, it may be used to suggest social values such as class. In this way, the objects and human relationship with objects in the interior environment has significant psychological meaning and impact. In ‚ÄúSocial Attributions Based on Domestic Interiors‚Äù by M.A. Wilson and N.E. Mackenzie it is proposed that: ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs interactions with the environment are determined by the meanings they attribute to it, and both stress the impact of expectations on behaviour within a particular environment.‚Äù The study they discuss further developed the theme, that objects and the way in which we classify them, in turn, allows us to classify the social attributes of the owner of the objects, in relation to age and social class according to the object valuing system. This system suggests that our relationship with objects affects both our behaviour as we use objects according to their function, but also how we are perceived in the eyes of others. This makes our relationship with objects and space pivotal to our psychology.  Space-time relationships  Charles Rice references the thinking of Walter Benjamin, in The Emergence of the Interior, on the study of interiorization and experience. He proposes that in our faster-paced modern society experiences are instantaneous and through this we are missing long experiences such as a connection with tradition and the accumulation of wisdom over time. To reforge a sense of this relationship and address the current lack he demonstrates that we might materially create such a relationship through inanimate objects in our environment. Giving the example: ‚Äúthat the hearth and the mantelpiece might materially encode the mythical fireside and the situation it provided for the telling of stories.‚Äù In this way, one‚Äôs relationship with objects can embody a sense of experience, and fulfil the desire for a connection with tradition.  Brief background  A greater awareness into this field has emerged since the 20th century, when the function and performance of the interior became of chief importance in designing habitations, the start of user-centred design, for example La Maison de Verre. This modern idea of the interior-designing for the user from the inside to the outside has coincided with psychological analysis on the effects on inhabitations. In The Emergence of the Interior, Charles Rice rationalized the implications of the interior: ‚Ä¢ Under context of modernity ‚Ä¢ Status of the experience ‚Ä¢ Presence of history and ‚Ä¢ Knowledge about subjectivity The Importance of the development of this field is evident through the above areas of study Understanding and implementation of interior design psychology has the ability to impact and improve the performance, efficiency and wellbeing of the individual inhabitant. As illustrated through the above categories this is an important and relevant developing field within design and planning.  See also  * Jean Baudrillard * John B.

The era follows the early modern history of Serbia. History of Serbia (1804‚Äì1918) =1804‚Äì1876= The history of modern Serbia began with the fight for liberation from the Ottoman occupation in 1804 (Serbian Revolution). The establishment of modern Serbia was marked by the hard-fought autonomy from the Ottoman Empire in the First Serbian Uprising in 1804 and the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815, though Turkish troops continued to garrison the capital, Belgrade, until 1867. Those revolutions revived the Serbian pride and gave them hope that their Empire might come into reality again. In 1829 Greece was given complete independence and Serbia was given its autonomy, which made her semi-independent from Turkey. Serbia's first constitution, the Sretenje or Candlemas constitution, was adopted in 1835, then replaced by the Constitution of 1838. Serbian Vojvodina and Principality of Serbia in 1848 During the Revolutions of 1848, the Serbs in the Austrian Empire proclaimed a Serbian autonomous province known as Serbian Vojvodina. By a decision of the Austrian emperor in November 1849, this province was transformed into the Austrian crownland known as the Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat (Dukedom of Serbia and Tami≈° Banat). Against the will of the Serbs, the province was abolished in 1860, but the Serbs from the region gained another opportunity to achieve their political demands in 1918. Today, this region is known as Vojvodina. =Independence 1878= Serbia and Montenegro declared war on Turkey in 1876 and were badly defeated. Russia, inspired by Pan-Slavism, decided to intervene. The war alongside Russia against the Turks in 1877 achieved victory and brought full independence for Serbia and large territorial gains toward the south-east, including Ni≈°, henceforth Serbia's second largest city. Some of the gains from the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano were reversed by the intervention of Germany, Britain and other powers at the Treaty of Berlin (1878).Vaso Trivanovitch, \\"Serbia, Russia, and Austria during the Rule of Milan Obrenovich, 1868-78.\\" Journal of Modern History 3.3 (1931): 414-440. Online The Serbian Kingdom was proclaimed in 1882, under King Milan I. Serbia was one of the rare countries at the time that had its own domestic ruling dynasty on the throne (similarly to Italy). However, millions of Serbs still lived outside Serbia, in Austro-Hungarian Empire (Herzegovina, Bosnia, Croatia, Dalmatia, Vojvodina, Sand≈æak) and the Ottoman Empire (Kosovo, Macedonia). Russia and Austria constantly became involved in Serbian domestic politics and foreign affairs.Charles Jelavich, Tsarist Russia and Balkan nationalism: Russian influence in the internal affairs of Bulgaria and Serbia, 1879-1886 (U of California Press, 1958). The new country was, like most of the Balkan lands, poor and overwhelmingly agrarian, with little in the way of industry or modern infrastructure. The total population rose from a million in the early 19th century to 2.5 million in 1900, when Belgrade contained 100,000 inhabitants (northern part was held by Austro-Hungary), Ni≈° 24,500 and half a dozen other cities 10‚Äì15,000 each. Internal politics revolved largely around the dynastic rivalry between the Obrenoviƒá and Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá families, descendants respectively of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (recognised as hereditary prince in 1829) and Karaƒëorƒëe (Black George), leader of the 1804 revolt but killed in 1817. The Obrenoviƒái headed the emerging state in 1817-1842 and 1858-1903, the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒái in 1842-1858 and after 1903. Milan I was ruler of Serbia from 1868 to 1889, first as prince (1868-1882), subsequently as king (1882-1889). After the 1880s the dynastic issue became entwined to some extent with wider diplomatic divisions in Europe. King Milan I aligned his foreign policy with that of neighbouring Austria-Hungary in return for Habsburg support for his elevation to king. =1900‚Äì1914= The Karaƒëorƒëeviƒái inclined more toward Russia, gaining the throne in June 1903 after the bloody May Overthrow organised by a group of Army officers led by then-Captain Dragutin Dimitrijeviƒá Apis. After the 1903 coup, Serbia was securely in the Russian camp and henceforth followed a policy of irritating Austria-Hungary at every opportunity. Serbian opposition to Austria-Hungary's October 1908 annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a territory Serbia craved for itself, brought about the Bosnian crisis: German and Austro-Hungarian pressure forced Russia to prevail on Serbia (March 31, 1909) to accept the annexation, but Russia undertook to defend Serbia against any future threats to her independence. Following Bulgaria's independence (October 1908) from Ottoman overlordship and a successful movement by Greek army officers (August 1909) to steer their government onto a more nationalistic course, Serbia joined with the other two countries and her Serb-populated neighbour Montenegro in invading (October 1912) Ottoman-held Macedonia and reducing Turkey-in-Europe to a small region around Constantinople (now Istanbul). Bulgaria failed in her subsequent attempt (July 1913) to take from her allies territory which she had originally been promised (see Balkan Wars), and to Habsburg alarm at another near- doubling of Serbia's territory was added Bulgarian resentment at having been denied what she saw as her just share of the territorial gains. =Serbia in World War I= Kingdom of Serbia in 1913 On June 28, 1914, a team of seven assassins awaited the heir to the throne of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, at his announced visit in Sarajevo. After Nedeljko ƒåabrinoviƒá's first unsuccessful attack, the Bosnian Serb nationalist Gavrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke and his wife Sophie Chotek. Princip, ƒåabrinoviƒá and their accomplice Trifko Grabe≈æ had come from Belgrade; the three told almost all they knew to Austro-Hungarian authorities. Serbian Major Vojislav Tankosiƒá directly and indirectly not only had provided six hand grenades, four Browning Automatic Pistols and ammunition, but also money, suicide pills, training, a special map with the location of gendarmes marked, knowledge of contacts on a special channel used to infiltrate agents and arms into Austria-Hungary, and a small card authorizing the use of that special channel. Major Tankosiƒá confirmed to the historian Luciano Magrini that he provided the bombs and revolvers and was responsible for the self-avowed terrorists‚Äô training, and that he initiated the idea of the suicide pills. From June 30 to July 6 Austria-Hungary and Germany made requests to Serbia directly and her through Serbia's ally Russia to open an inquiry into the plot on Serbian soil but were flatly rejected.Albertini, Luigi. Origins of the War of 1914, Oxford University Press, London, 1953, Vol II pp. 189-190,273 In its July Ultimatum from July 23, Austria-Hungary asked Serbia to act in conformity with its March 1909 commitment to the Great Powers to respect the territorial integrity of Austria-Hungary and to maintain good neighborly relations, giving Serbia a 48-hour time limit. Failure to accept these demands would result in the withdrawal of Austria-Hungary's diplomatic legation from Serbia. Serbia drafted a conciliatory response, accepting all the points except point #6, demanding a criminal investigation against those participants in the conspiracy that were present in Serbia, and point #7 to allow an Austrian delegation to participate in the investigation. Prior to issuing its reply to the Austrian Note, the Serbian army was mobilized. In response, Austria- Hungary withdrew its ambassador. It was reported that Serbian reservist soldiers on tramp steamers fired on Austro-Hungarian troops near Temes-Kubin in Hungary, on July 27. This report was false.Herwig, Holger H. The Marne, 1914, Random House Digital, Inc., 2009, pp 10 However, together with the unsatisfactory Serbian reply to the Austrian Note and the fact that Serbia had mobilized its army before sending the reply, the report convinced the Austrian Foreign Minister, Berchtold, that the problem of Austro-Serbian tension could only be solved by war. War was formally declared on Serbia at noon on July 28, 1914, even though Serbia was not a signatory to the international convention which required this step. Serbia repulsed three Austro-Hungarian invasions (August, September and November‚ÄìDecember 1914), in the last of which Belgrade was held temporarily by the enemy. But during 1915 an epidemic of typhus decimated the Serbian army, and renewed invasion in early October, this time involving also German and Bulgarian forces, resulted in the occupation of the whole country. The remnants of Serbia's armed forces retreated into Albania and Macedonia, where British and French forces had landed at Thessaloniki. Persecutions and deaths followed. The period of government exile in Macedonia was marked by a significant shift in the balance of political forces. Black Hand leaders were arrested, tried, convicted (confessing their roles in the assassination) and in three cases executed on false charges (overturned posthumously). Military circles would henceforth be dominated by the royalist \\"White Hand\\" faction of Gen. Petar ≈Ωivkoviƒá, later prime minister (1929‚Äì32) of an extra-constitutional monarchical regime. A successful Allied offensive in September 1918 secured first Bulgaria's surrender and then the liberation of the occupied territories (November 1918). On November 25, the Assembly of Serbs, Bunjevci, and other nations of Vojvodina in Novi Sad voted to join the region to Serbia. Also, on November 29 the National Assembly of Montenegro voted for union with Serbia, and two days later an assembly of leaders of Austria-Hungary's southern Slav regions voted to join the new State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (see also History of Yugoslavia). Comparing to the other European countries Serbia had by far the greatest casualties in the war, having over 30% (1,3 million) of its total population perished. History of Serbia since 1918 Borders of the Kingdom of Serbia in November 26, 1918, after unification with Syrmia (November 24), Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja (November 25) and Montenegro (November 26) After the military victory over Austria-Hungary in the First World War, the Kingdom of Serbia was restored and was joined with other South Slavic lands formerly administered by Austria- Hungary into the newly formed Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929). This new South Slavic kingdom was created on December 1, 1918 and de facto existed until the Axis invasion in 1941 (de jure until the proclamation of the republic in November 29, 1945). Map showing the proposals for creation of Banovina of Serbia, Banovina of Croatia and Slovene Banovina (in 1939-1941). From 1918 to 1941, Serbia did not exist as a political entity, since the SCS Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) was a centralist country divided into administrative provinces that were not created in accordance with ethnic or historical criteria. However, the country was ruled by a Serb king and dominated by a Serb political elite. This triggered resentment among the Croats, whose politicians demanded federalization of the country. A Serb-Croat political compromise was achieved in 1939 when a new province known as the Banovina of Croatia was created. Some Serb intellectuals also demanded that the rest of the Yugoslav provinces (excluding the Drava Banovina) be joined into the new Banovina of Serbia,Dr Tomislav Bogavac, Nestajanje Srba, Ni≈°, 1994, page 122. but this political project was never realized. In 1941, after the Axis invasion and occupation of Yugoslavia, German occupational authorities created an occupied territory named Serbia and installed a Serbian puppet government there. Occupied Serbia included much of the territory of the present-day Republic of Serbia, excluding some areas that were occupied and annexed by the Independent State of Croatia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Italy. The Banat region, which was part of occupied Serbia, had a special autonomous status and was governed by its ethnic German minority. Besides the armed forces of the Serbian pro-Axis puppet regime, two anti-Axis resistance movements operated in the territory of Serbia: the royalist Chetniks and the communist Partisans. The two resistance movements also turned one against another, which resulted in a general armed civil war in Serbia. Temporarily, in the autumn of 1941, the communist resistance movement created a short lived Republic of U≈æice in south-western Serbia, but this entity was soon destroyed by the joint efforts of Axis troops and pro-Axis Serbian armed forces. In 1944, the Soviet Red Army and Yugoslav Partisans expelled all Axis troops from Serbia and the area was included into the restored Yugoslavia. Unlike pre-war Yugoslavia, which had a centralist system of government, the post-war Yugoslavia was established as a federation of six equal republics. One of the republics was Serbia, which had two autonomous provinces: Vojvodina and Kosovo. From the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, the autonomous provinces of Serbia gained extensive political rights and were represented separately from Serbia in some areas of federal government, although they were still de jure subordinated to Serbia. The new Serbian constitution from 1990 greatly reduced the autonomy of Kosovo and Vojvodina and strengthened the central government in Serbia. After the breakup of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1991‚Äì1992, Serbia and Montenegro formed a new federation of the two republics naming it the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Following the clashes between the Kosovo Liberation Army and Serbian and Yugoslav authorities, as well as the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo became an UN protectorate. In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was transformed into the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, and following the Montenegrin Independence Referendum of 2006, Serbia and Montenegro were transformed into two independent states. In 2008 Kosovo declared independence from Serbia and this was subsequently recognized by the majority of other countries in Europe and the World.

In the same month, the first ship building contract was signed for 4 container ships. In May 2006, the construction of a shipyard began on Redondo Peninsula - on the northern edge of Subic Bay. The first vessel \\"Argolikos\\" was delivered in July 2008 for the Greek ship owner Dioryx. As of April 2011, the shipyard had delivered 20 ships. In 2013, the shipyard made its first oil tanker and in 2016, it delivered its first gas carrier. Additionally, the shipyard has also built parts of CALM buoys used for the Malampaya offshore project. The shipyard also has two large drydocks. In January 2019, the company filed for the biggest bankruptcy in the Philippines with unpaid loan obligations amounting to $412 million.  Background  As a part of its expansion process overseas, in 2004, Hanjin Heavy Industries Corporation started construction of a shipyard in Redondo peninsula, north of Subic bay, Zambales, Philippines. As per the HHIC website, this has resulted in the fourth largest shipyard in the world. As of 2011 September, the shipyard employed 21,000 Filipinos. Its workforce was expected to increase to nearly 28,000 in 2016, however a slump in ship building projects has limited the workforce to 20,000 people as of 2017. As of September 2017, HHIC Phil is the largest shipyard in the Philippines and one of the largest private employers in the country. According to the New York Times article \\"Philippines Role May Grow as U.S. Adjusts Asia Strategy\\" of April 30, 2012: \\"On April 18, a subsidiary of Huntington Ingalls Industries, a United States defense contractor, announced a deal to work with Hanjin Heavy Industries, which maintains a shipbuilding and repair facility at the former base at Subic Bay. That opens the door to large-scale servicing of United States military ships there for the first time in almost 20 years.\\" In a news release announcing the deal, Huntington Ingalls said the companies ‚Äúwill work together in providing maintenance, repair and logistics services to the U.S. Navy and other customers in the Western Pacific region.‚Äù  Shipyard  A 20.766 TEU container ship (CMA CGM Louis Bleriot) and oil tanker (Levantine Sea) being constructed at Dry Dock no. 6 The shipyard is located at the tip of the Redondo peninsula, in sitio Agusuhin, in the province of Zambales, Luzon, Philippines. A large number of Koreans and Romanians who form the higher level management of the shipyard live inside the shipyard, in baracks accommodations (often jocularly called chicken coops). The land here is owned by SBMA - Subic bay metropolitan authority and leased out to HHIC Phil on a 40 year lease. Jeepneys and buses hired to HHIC transport workers daily and run between HHIC shipyard and the two close by towns - Castillejos and Subic, with many others staying in the farther towns of Olongapo and Barrio Baretto. Most workers come to work at HHIC from other parts of the Philippines and stay in boarding houses in these towns. A large ferry takes workers to and from Olongapo daily. The company also charters 25 buses to transport its workers to and from Olongapo daily. Additionally, two smaller fast ferries owned by HHIC transport a small number of owners representatives from the Hanjin jetty (near All hands beach - SBMA) to the shipyard. Security to access the shipyard remains tight due to high pilferage by workers during the early years of the shipyard. The area is also strategically important to the Philippines armed forces, hence is protected by both - The HHIC Police as well as Philippines armed forces commandos.  Bankruptcy  On 22 November 2018, HHIC Phil delivered two recently completed 114,000 DWT crude oil tankers. However, with 20 vessels currently in different stages of construction, the shipyard found it difficult to service its high debts or to get further extensions from its lenders. On January 8, 2019, the yard filed for corporate rehabilitation due to default or failure to comply it loan obligation of $412 million to five Philippine banks namely Rizal Commercial Banking Corp., Land Bank, Metrobank, Bank of the Philippine Islands, and Banco de Oro. This became the biggest bankruptcy in the Philippines surpassing $386 million default by Lehman Brothers in the Philippines in 2008. The five bank creditors are working to take over HHIC Phil's shipyard. On 19 January 2019, it wsa reported that two Chinese firms had lodged expressions of interest to purchase the shipyard along with its debt. Subsequently, Trade Winds reported that HHIC Phil and the Philippine government had agreed upon a debt swap deal. Labor policy = Nationalities employed = The managerial staff in the shipyard consists of around 100 Koreans. Mid-manager level staff includes Koreans, Romanians and Filipinos. The foremen for workers include Koreans, Filipinos and Romanians, most of them employed by subsidiary companies of HHIC Phil operated by Filipinos. Most of the approximately 200 Romanian workers are employed in dock 5 and a few in Dock No.6 through the Romanian recruitment company Gateway Trading SRL. The large bulk of workers consists of nearly 19,000 Filipinos as of 2017. The shipyard provides free lunch, dinner and breakfast to all its workers in five large canteens. = Alleged labor violations = While HHIC's presence in Subic has brought thousands of jobs to the area, a steady stream of accidental workplace deaths and alleged labor violations has called into question the company's compliance with Philippine labor and occupational safety laws. During a two-month span in 2008, five workers were killed in accidents that may have resulted from unsafe working conditions. This prompted investigations by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority and Philippine Congress, which found violations of safety and labor laws. At the conclusion of the Congressional investigation, legislators required Hanjin to build a medical center and comply with industrial safety laws within six months. Workers have since continued to express complaints of abuse on the part of management; one such incident was caught on camera and distributed to the Filipino news station ABS-CBN. Many workers have also begun to organize to attain union recognition. According to organizers, who have started a blog to document abuses, 60 employees have been terminated for union-related activity and over 30 have been killed in workplace accidents since the shipyard opened in 2006. Filipino church groups like the Caritas Filipinas Foundation have also rallied around the workers.http://nassa.org.ph/?p=94 HHIC-Phil general manager Pyeong Jong Yu has expressed commitment to preventing future incidents.http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/03/11/08/two-workers- killed-another-hanjin-freak-accident.. Since 2011, standards of safety at the shipyard have improved, especially after ship owners introduced their own health and safety teams to augment the shipyard efforts.  List of ships built  The shipyard builds bulk carriers, container ships and oil tankers. Additionally, it has undertaken offshore construction work such as CALM buoys for offshore projects such as the Malampaya offshore project. *Container ships - Capacity in TEUs - 4,300, 3,600 and 12,800 *Bulk carriers - Capacity 135,000 tonnes, 175,000 tonnes, 205,000 tonnes *VLCC - capacity 320,000 tonnes = Ships built by HHIC Phil = Note: This ship may be incomplete. # M/V Argolikos - container (First container ship built in Philippines, First ship built by HHIC Phil) # M/T Eser K - 114,000-deadweight ton crude oil tanker # M/T Leyla K - tanker - Largest tanker built in Philippines - as of October 2011 # M/V Mineral Manila - bulk carrierhttp://www.timawa.net/forum/index.php?topic=28394.0 # M/V Mineral Subic - bulk carrier # M/V Lake Dolphin (capacity 180,000 deadweight tonnes and net tonnage 59,082 tons).http://www.hhic-phil.com/pr/newsroom_read.aspx?bbsID=226 # M/V Rahi - bulk carrier # M/V Vanshi - bulk carrier # M/V Opal - container # M/V Topaz - Container # M/V Turquoise - container - Also called CMA CGM Turquoise # M/V Star Borealis # M/V Star Polaris # M/V Houheng 2 (2011) # M/V Rio Manaus (2011 - MPC GmBH Germany) # M/V Rio Montevideo (2011 - MPC GmBH Germany) - Bulk carrier # M/V Houheng 3 (2011) - Bulk carrier # M/V Brightway (2012) - Tanker # M/V FMG Matilda (2012) - Bulk carrier, Bocimar group # M/V Aanya (2012) - Bulk carrier # M/V RTM Cook (2012) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # M/V RTM Cartier (2012) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # M/V Broadway (2012) - Tanker, Tanker Pacific # M/V Crossway (2012) - Tanker, Tanker Pacific # M/V RTM Dampier (2012) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # RTM Zheng He (2012) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # RTM Cabot (2013) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # RTM Drake(2013) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # RTM Columbus (2013) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # RTM Tasman (2013) - Bulk carrier, Rio Tinto Marine # Maersk Euphrates (2014) - Container, Maersk lines # CMA CGM Antoine de Saint Exupery (2018) - Contianer, CMA CGM (France) # Koksijde (2018) - LPG Carrier, Exmar. # Kapellen (2018) - LPG Carrier, Exmar. # CMA CGM Louis Bleriot (2018) - Container, CMA CGM (France) # Levantine Sea (2018) - Crude oil tanker, Tomtef shipping inc.

The Smiths moved to Rivoli Bay south (Greytown) in 1845 where Christina acted with Christian compassion for the Buandig people concerned at their treatment by other European settlers and engaged in education and Christian missionary work with the aborigines.MacGillivray, Leith G., Smith, Christina (1809‚Äì1893), Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/smith- christina-13198/text23895, accessed 14 September 2011.

Christina and her son Duncan Stewart learnt the Bungandidj language with Duncan being appointed an interpreter for this language in 1853. The family moved to a small farm near Mount Gambier in 1854 where Christina opened a night school teaching aboriginal orphans and adults until James Smith's death in 1860. A day school was opened in 1864 in Mount Gambier teaching scripture and the rudiments of a basic education to aboriginal children. After an epidemic and loss of support for her school and with student numbers reduced to 4, the school closed in 1868, although it continued as a home for Buandig orphan children.

Forces led by Akbar surrounded and besieged 8,000 Rajputs and around 40,000 peasants under the command of Jaimal in Chittorgarh. The fortress The history of the imposing fortress of Chittor is believed to date back to the 7th century. Known as Chitrakuta Durga, it is said to have been raised by Chitrangada of the Mori dynasty and then passed into the hands of the Pratiharas in the 9th century. Subsequent owners of this seat of power included the Paramaras (10th‚Äì11th century) and the Solankis (12th century) before it fell into the hands of the Guhilots or Sisodias of Mewar. The fort stands atop a 152m hill and covers an area of . It has a number of gateways and ponds including the Gaumukha kund and Hathi Kund, which is supplied by perennial underground source of water. Heavily fortified, Chittorgarh was believed to be insurmountable until it was sacked by Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate in 1303. It was sacked again a couple of centuries later by Bahadur Shah of the Gujarat Sultanate. Background The Mughals had always been wary of the kingdoms of Rajasthan. Besides being a centre of power, the Rajput dominions also hindered access to both Gujarat and its prosperous seaports as well as Malwa. To control either of these regions, the Mughal emperor needed to arrive at an understanding with the Rajputs. Local rulers such as Raja Bharmal of Amber had already submitted to Akbar in 1562. Mewar, the most powerful and prominent of the Rajput states, however, had not. While Udai Singh, the Rana of Mewar was open to accepting Mughal suzerainty and paying a tribute, he was not prepared to lower his head in obedience to Akbar as, according to Abu'l-Fazl, \\"none of his ancestors had bowed down and kissed the ground\\". Furthermore, the Rana had also vexed Akbar when he first granted asylum to Baz Bahadur of Malwa and later, to the Mirzas of Sambhal. After handling the rebellions of the Mirzas and the Uzbek nobles in 1567, Akbar turned his eyes towards Rajasthan and its prestigious kingdom of Mewar. Prior to the siege, the Mughals under Asaf Khan and Wazir Khan attacked and conquered Mandalgarh, where Rawat Balvi solanki was defeated.Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl\\"ƒÄ·π£af KhƒÅn and Wazƒ´r KhƒÅn.. went... with orders to attack the fortress of MƒÅndal...It was...defended by...Rawat Balvƒ´ Solangƒ´....but the conquered it.\\" On 20 October 1567, he encamped near the fortress of Chittorgarh. Maharana Udai Singh II had already retreated from the fortress of Chittorgarh and went to Gogunda, leaving behind 8,000 soldiers and 1,000 musketeers under the command of Jaimal and Patta. After arriving at Chittorgarh, Akbar sent Asaf Khan to Rampur and Hussain Quli Khan to Udaipur and Kumbalgarh to plunder the Rana's territories. Though both of these areas were raided, Udai Singh II was not found.Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl\\"ƒÄ·π£af KhƒÅn with a number of officers was sent off to RƒÅmp≈´r...·∏§usain Qulƒ´ KhƒÅn was sent with a large force to lay hold of him....·∏§usaƒ´n Qulƒ´ KhƒÅn arrived at Udaip≈´r...the hill-country of Kombalmƒ´r....made great search for the RƒÅnƒÅ...could get no trace.\\" The siege Initially, the Mughals tried to attack the fortress directly but the citadel was so sturdy that the only options available to the Mughals were to either starve out the occupants of the fort or to somehow reach the walls and sap beneath them. After initial aggressive attempts at reaching the wall failed, Akbar ordered a complement of 5,000 expert builders, stonemasons, and carpenters to construct sabats (approach trenches) and mines to reach the walls. Two mines and one sabat were constructed after significant casualties while three batteries bombarded the fort. A large siege cannon was also cast to breach the walls once the sabat reached the objective. The fort garrison which had been observing these preparations offered to surrender, and sent Sanda Silhadar and Sahib Khan to negotiate. They agreed to pay a yearly tribute and enroll in Akbar's court but were rebuffed by Akbar, who wanted Udai Singh himself to surrender.Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl\\"they had recourse to craft and sent, firstly SƒÅndƒÅ SilƒÅ·∏•dƒÅr, and secondly, ·π¢a·∏•ib KhƒÅn, and made use of entreaties...offered to enrol themselves among the subjects of the sublime court, and to send a yearly present.... but the sovereign dignity did not accept this view, and made the coming in of the RƒÅnƒÅ a condition of release from the siege.\\" Fifty-eight days after the siege began, the imperial sappers finally reached the walls of Chittorgarh. The two mines were exploded and the walls were breached at the cost of 200 of the assault force. But the defenders soon sealed the opening. Akbar then steadily brought his siege cannon closer to the walls under the cover of the sabat. Finally, on the night of 22 February 1568, the Mughals were able to breach the walls at several locations simultaneously to begin a coordinated assault. In the ensuing battle, Akbar was able to kill the Rajput commander, Jaimal, with a musket shot. His death shattered the morale of the defenders who considered the day lost. Jauhar (self-immolation) was committed in the houses of Patta Sisodia, Aissar Das, and Sahib Khan after the death of Jaimal. On 23 February 1568, Akbar personally entered Chittorgarh with a few thousand soldiers and it was conquered. The 1,000 musketeers escaped from the fortress.Akbarnama by Abu'l Fazl\\"One of the wonderful things was that the ShƒÅhinshƒÅh's wrath had been greatly excited against the skilful musketeers, but though much search was made no trace of them could be found.....by means of the disguise of trickery, carried off their lives in safety from the fort. Aftermath Akbar stayed at Chittorgarh for three days before leaving for the shrine of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti, as he had vowed to go to the shrine if he won the siege. The other great fort at Ranthambor fell the next year and by conquering these two seemingly insurmountable symbols, Akbar had demonstrated the reality of Mughal might to all the other powers of North India. However, Udai Singh II, the Rana of Mewar, continued to remain at large until his death four years later. His son Pratap Singh lost the Battle of Haldighati. Though losing the entire Mewar until 1582, through guerilla warfare, he managed to regain western Mewar until his death. In 1615 Amar Singh I, the son of Pratap Singh, accepted Mughal suzerainty and a year later Jahangir, as a goodwill gesture, allowed him entry in Chittor Fort under the condition that it will never be repaired, as it might be used a bastion for future rebellions.

ABSM shares office space and at least some staff with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) in Darien, Illinois, USA; the two organizations are closely related and serve basically the same constituency. In the past, the ABSM has offered four distinct examinations: * Sleep Medicine Specialty Certification Examination * Behavioral Sleep Medicine Certification Examination * Sleep Technologist Registry Examination * Sleep Scoring Proficiency Examination the ABSM still offers one examination: * Registered Sleep Technologist Examination (RST) The first two exams were offered mainly to physicians (MDs and DOs). However, non-physicians have taken and passed the exams. These have been mainly PhDs and DDSs. Therefore, the ABSM has put a disclaimer in its website cautioning everyone who has passed the exams to only practice medicine within the legal limits allowed. Those passing the Sleep Medicine Specialty Exam received the designation \\"diplomate of the ABSM.\\" As of 2006 3,445 persons had been awarded this designation. As of 2007 the ABSM stopped administering this exam. Now member boards of the American Board of Medical Specialties offer specialty exams. The third and fourth exams on the list are geared toward sleep technologists. The Sleep Scoring Proficiency Examination is intended for those interested in the taking the Sleep Technologist Registry Examination. The latter exam was implemented in August 2011. The credential awarded to the individual passing this exam is the Registered Sleep Technologist (RST) credential. The first persons awarded the RST were Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (RPSGTs) who met the criteria the ABSM set forth to bypass taking the exam. The first RST credentials were awarded in August 2011. By September 11, 2011, 975 RST credentials were awarded; ten days later 1,549 individuals held this credential. The ABSM and the AASM have both been involved in promoting and explaining the rationale for the RST credential. Within the sleep community there has been much discussion and some disagreement about the launching of the RST credential when credentials already exist for the RPSGT (from the Board of Registered Polysomnographic Technologists (BRPT)) and the RRT-SDS and CRT-SDS (from the American Association of Sleep Technologists (AAST)). The July/August 2011 issue of Sleep Review magazine has an editorial and an article where the RST credential is discussed.
