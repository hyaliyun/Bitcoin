They released three studio albums and one EP collection, before parting ways in 2001. In the summer of 2000, Christian along with some band mates and brother, Gustaf Kjellvander, recorded \\"The Painted Trees of Ghostwood\\" under the name Songs of Soil. After the dismantle of Loosegoats, Christian decided to go solo and after spending July 2002 in a studio in southern Sweden, Songs From A Two-Room Chapel was released in the fall of the same year. The following 18 months Christian toured in Sweden and the rest of Scandinavia as well as Europe and a shorter US tour with The Cardigans. In the summer of 2005, Christian returned to the studio with his band, Lazy Grace Frontier, to record the follow-up to the both critically and commercially successful solo debut. \\"Drunken Hands\\" was the first single from Christian's second solo effort Faya, released in late 2005. Kjellvander spent 2006 touring both with Lazy Grace Frontier and alone in Scandinavia and Europe. In early 2007, it was announced on Christian's homepage that he would be supporting Logh on their European tour in April and May. During the summer of 2007, Kjellvander kept a low profile, only performing a few solo acoustic gigs, while recording his third solo effort at Mission Hall Studio. The working title of the album has been \\"I saw her from here, I saw here from her\\", which Kjellvander revealed on his MySpace blog. Several titles of potential tracks have been released, among them \\"Somewhere Else\\", \\"Two Souls\\", and \\"Until The Mourning Comes\\". The latter was recorded on a digital camera by Christian himself and released as a YouTube video by his record label Startracks at the end of July. In mid-October, \\"Two Souls\\" was released as the first, official single from Kjellvander's third solo effort. The song can be found on Christian's MySpace page and on YouTube with the official video. Additionally, Kjellvander's booking agent, Luger, has released several new press photos.

Although the media have a record of unbiased reporting,Text used in this cited section originally came from: Bulgaria (June 2005) profile from the Library of Congress Country Studies project. Bulgaria‚Äôs lack of specific legislation protecting the media from state interference is a theoretical weakness. Conditions in Bulgaria‚Äôs twelve aging and overcrowded prisons generally are poor. A probate reform in mid-2005 was expected to relieve prison overcrowding. The police have been accused of abusing prisoners and using illegal investigative methods, and institutional incentives discourage full reporting and investigation of many crimes. The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but local governments have attempted to enforce special registration requirements on some groups not designated as historically entitled to full protection. Besides the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, the faiths so designated are the Jewish, Muslim, and Roman Catholic. Court backlogs and weak court administration make constitutional protection of defendants‚Äô rights problematic in some instances. Institutions for children and adults with mental disabilities The conditions in Bulgaria's network of institutions for children and adults with mental disabilities have raised concerns. The Mental Disability Advocacy Center has launched a collective complaint under the European Committee on Social Rights regarding the failure to provide education for children in social care homes run by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy; and a case is currently pending before the European Court of Human Rights concerning the alleged failure to investigate inhuman and degrading treatment in institutions for adults. The documentary \\"Bulgaria's Abandoned Children\\" (TrueVision, 2007) was broadcast on BBC Four in the UK in September 2007, and depicts the deprivation of food, health-care and education for children at the institution in Mogilino. The widespread institutionalization of children in Bulgaria is unlikely to be consistent with the best interests of the child, and almost certainly violates Article 23 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) Macedonian minority There exists a small number of individuals identifying as ethnic Macedonian in the Blagoevgrad province of Bulgaria. According to the 2011 census 1,654 people declared themselves to be ethnic Macedonians and 561 from them were living in the Blagoevgrad Province. The Greek Helsinki Monitor reports that the \\"Bulgarian state and public opinion alike deny their right to self-identification\\", and that \\"any actions pertaining to public demonstration of the Macedonian identity in Bulgaria are subjected to a more or less direct suppression and denial\\". That considered, Macedonian is given as an option for nationality on the census. The Bulgarian majority (including the press) regards Macedonians living in Bulgaria as 'pure' Bulgarians. Macedonians have been refused the right to register political parties (see United Macedonian Organization Ilinden and UMO Ilinden - PIRIN) on the grounds that the party was an \\"ethnic separatist organization funded by a foreign government\\", something that is against the Bulgarian constitution. The constitutional court has not however banned the Evroroma (–ï–≤—Ä–æ—Ä–æ–º–∞) and MRF(–î–ü–°) parties, who are widely considered as ethnic parties. The European Court of Human Rights held \\"unanimously, that there had been a violation of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the European Convention on Human Rights.\\" courtesy Archive.org In November 2006, the members of the European Parliament Milan Hor√°ƒçek, Joost Lagendijk, Angelika Beer and Elly de Groen-Kouwenhoven introduced an amendment to the accession of Bulgaria to the European Union protocol calling ‚Äúon the Bulgarian authorities to prevent any further obstruction to the registration of the political party of the ethnic Macedonians (OMO-Ilinden PIRIN) and to put an end to all forms of discrimination and harassment vis-√†-vis that minority.‚Äù On May 28, 2018, the European Court of Human Rights made two decisive rulings against Bulgaria in violation of Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In the two rulings: Case of Vasilev and Society of the Repressed Macedonians in Bulgaria Victims of the Communist Terror v. Bulgaria (Application no. 23702/15); and Case of Macedonian Club for Ethnic Tolerance in Bulgaria and Radonov v. Bulgaria (Application no. 67197/13), the European Court of Human Rights unanimously ruled that Bulgaria violated Article 11 (freedom of assembly and association) of the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, and that Bulgaria must pay a collective total of 16,000 euros to the applicants. Romani (Roma) Bulgarian state security forces have been known to arbitrarily arrest and abuse street children of Romani ethnic origin. The Romani are subjected to harassment in Bulgaria, including the hazing of Romani army conscripts and poor police responses to crimes committed against Romani. A high percentage of Romani children do not attend school, both due to poverty and a lack of proficiency in Bulgarian. On the other hand, the mainly ethnic Roma, Free Bulgaria party has been allowed to run for elections and has achieved some success. A report by the New York Times notes that \\"in the Roma suburb in Kyustendil, most roads are unpaved and strewn with garbage,\\" and that Roma children have no access to computers and broad-band internet for learning during the pandemic. Kyustendil authorities claim the lockdowns in the town are to prevent the spread of the virus, while Roma activists claim bigotry. Human trafficking There has been a growing awareness of human trafficking as a human rights issue in Europe (see main article: trafficking in human beings). The end of communism has contributed to an increase in human trafficking, with the majority of victims being women forced into prostitution. courtesy Archive.org Bulgaria is a country of origin and country of transit for persons, primarily women and children, trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. The Bulgarian government has shown some commitment to combat trafficking but has been criticized for failing to develop effective measures in law enforcement and victim protection. courtesy Archive.org Religious freedom The Constitution provides for freedom of religion; however, the law prohibits the public practice of religion by unregistered groups. The Constitution also designates Eastern Orthodox Christianity as the \\"traditional\\" religion. There were some reports of societal abuses or discrimination based on religious belief or practice. Discrimination, harassment, and general public intolerance, particularly in the media, of some religious groups remained an intermittent problem. International criticism The European Court of Human Rights often holds that Bulgaria violates the European Convention on Human Rights. In 2015, the Court issued a special press release dedicated to a systemic problem of Bulgaria's justice system: it underlined that \\"in over 45 judgments against Bulgaria...the authorities had failed to comply with their obligation to carry out an effective investigation.\\" The European Court of Human Rights has also handed down pilot judgments against Bulgaria - they are delivered when the Court identifies a series of applications pertaining to similar facts. For example, in the pilot judgment Neshkov v Bulgaria, the Court gave Bulgaria 18 months to improve prison conditions. Social activists have raised concern that Bulgaria is lagging behind other European Union Member States in a number of international indexes which measure the protection of civil rights and liberties. The Council of Europe has also expressed worries about Bulgaria's compromised rule of law.

It was owned by the Austrian Mail and thus by the government. It merged on 1 October 2005 with the BAWAG to form BAWAG P.S.K.. History =During the Austro-Hungarian Empire= √ñsterreichische Postsparkasse was founded by law in 1882. On 28 May, the parliamentary bill \\"...on the introduction of postal savings banks in kingdoms and countries represented by the Imperial Assembly\\"\\"...betreffend die Einf√ºhrung von Postsparcassen in den im Reichsrathe vertretenen K√∂nigreichen und L√§ndern.\\" Source at: P.S.K. Firmengeschichte was passed in the Imperial Council (Reichsrat). The government bill was drawn up by Georg Coch, the founder and first director of the bank. The first headquarters of the \\"k.k. Postsparcassen-Amt\\" (Imperial- Royal Postal Savings Office) was opened on 12 January 1883 in the former Dominican Monastery building on Wollzeile street in the first Viennese district Innere Stadt. About 4,000 post office branches located throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire began offering their postal savings service to customers. The idea behind offering financial services at post offices was to promote public awareness and encourage saving. The added benefit of the system was to make important funds available to the state and to guarantee the security of the deposits with government liability. In October 1883, Coch introduced a revolutionary innovation, the system of cashless transfers (Scheckverkehr), whereby a written instruction authorised the debit of one account and the credit to another. This radically changed the monetary system and made the P.S.K. into the centre of payment transactions. The new system of cashless transfers started spreading throughout the world.P.S.K.History: A look back at over 120 years of banking history and tradition The bank also saw the expansion of the foreign payment transaction system. Giro agreements were signed with the Austro-Hungarian Bank and other foreign postal savings bank throughout Europe. In 1906 the new headquarters in Vienna designed by the architect Otto Wagner was constructed. It is located at what is today Georg- Coch-Platz in the first district Innere Stadt along the Ringstra√üe boulevard. The building is one of the most important examples of Viennese Jugendstil which is also known as The Vienna Secession. Its clear lines and the cool elegance, which is achieved by the usage of steel, concrete and glass, give the building a solid and impenetrable look. The skylight in the main hall nevertheless allows for natural light to reach the interior of the building, making it light and airy at the same time. The headquarters building became the most recognisable trademark of the postal savings bank. For more information on the building by Otto Wagner see Austrian Postal Savings Bank. =World War I and aftermath= World War I dealt a heavy blow to the bank. With the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, its areas of activity were restricted to the much smaller, newly founded Austrian Republic. As a result, the number of post office branches was heavily reduced from 7,000 to around 2,000.P.S.K.History A look back at over 120 years of banking history and tradition On 28 December 1926, parliament passed a new law which liberalised the P.S.K., transferring it from direct state administration and control into a separate, independent legal entity as a public company. Following the Anschluss of Austria to Nazi Germany from 1938 to 1945, the P.S.K. was dissolved as a legal entity by the Nazis, and all assets were transferred to Germany. =Rebirth and merger= Old Logo of the P.S.K. After the liberation and the restoration of Austria, the postal savings bank was re-founded on 26 April 1945, as √ñsterreichische Postsparkassenamt. It was the first Viennese banking institute to resume its services and was under the direct control of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance. It remained under the direct control of the ministry until 1 January 1970, when the 1969 Postal Savings Bank Act ()P.S.K.Firmengeschichte R√ºckblick auf 120 Jahre Bankgeschichte und Tradition came into effect. The bank regained its pre-war status as an independent legal entity in form of a public company. √ñsterreichische Postsparkasse, as it was now called, was however required to further follow the monetary and fiscal policy of the Austrian Federal Government in its business dealings and to support the Austrian National Bank (OeNB) in all currency and lending policies. The Federal Government assumed liability for all P.S.K. obligations in return for the right to half of the annual net profit. The law formed the starting point for a new business strategy aimed at creating a market-oriented range of services. The strategy seemed to work well, as the bank grew and was able to further consolidate its position in 1976, when it purchased the majority stake in the Appell Kunden-Kredit Teilzahlungsbank regGenmbH, which was one year later converted into a full bank under the name Bank der √ñsterreichischen Postsparkasse AG (P.S.K. Bank AG). The 1990s saw substantial change for the bank. In 1996, parliament passed a law to change the P.S.K. into a joint stock company (). The following year, the Federal Ministry of Finance allowed the P.S.K. to grant private loans. With the award of the license the bank secured preferential treatment for financing of companies that are majority-owned by the government. The P.S.K. registered with the company register at the Vienna commercial court. The bank also was listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange. The Austrian government was liable for any financial obligations of the newly listed company. With the new restructuring, a new agreement was signed between the P.S.K. and the Austrian Mail Service of how the post offices would continue to offer the financial services. Old logo of the P.S.K. with the postal horn, when it still belonged to the postal system In 2000, 74.82% of the bank's shares were bought by Bank f√ºr Arbeit und Wirtschaft AG (BAWAG) and the remaining 25.18% by KSP Unternehmensbeteiligungsgesellschaft mbH. The merger of the two financial institutes created the BAWAG P.S.K., making it Austria‚Äôs third-largest banking group. By 2000 the balance sheet had a total of almost 45 million euros and the new group had about 5000 employees, some 2000 outlets and over one million private customers. The BAWAG P.S.K. Group now has the largest centrally managed sales network in Austria. Areas of activity The bank's services cover the classical areas of retail banking and corporate banking. Apart from offering financial services, the bank also sponsors cultural events such as art exhibitions, especially on the Viennese Jugendstil, concerts, as well as donating for social issues such as fundraisers for victims of natural disasters.

It started in 2003 and was sold in 2009 to Wizard Entertainment owner Gareb Shamus. It was subsequently relaunched as a Wizard event in 2010. The event has been on hiatus since spring 2012. From 2003-2007 the subtitle for the event was \\"A Celebration of Comic Books, Graphic Novels, Manga and Sequential Art\\". During those years the event was scheduled to run over three days (Friday through Sunday). In 2008 the convention was a two-day event (Saturday and Sunday).  Events  Features have included: exhibitor room for commercial selling of related goods, a corporate area for companies to promote their projects, an Artist Alley area for comic book creators, a guest area for invited guests of the convention, panel room for discussions on various aspects of comic books and creators, workshops and children's programming. In previous years the convention was the home to additional special events programming such as Women of Comics Symposium and the Joe Shuster Awards.  History  Staff from Paradise Comics, a Toronto comic book store, put on one-day comic book conventions in Toronto starting in the early 1990s. In November 2003, they held their first three-day event. In 2004, it was held in mid-June. In 2005 and 2006, it was held in late April. In 2007, it was held in June, and in 2008, it was held in mid-July (July 12‚Äì13, 2008). On occasion, Paradise has also held one-day shows at the Hilton and Holiday Inn on King (now the Toronto Hyatt Regency). From 2003‚Äì2007, the convention was held at the National Trade Centre (now called the Direct Energy Centre, located at Exhibition Place (home of the historic Canadian National Exhibition). Hall size varied at that location, and the convention's largest hall rental was Hall C in 2006‚Äì7, which is . In July 2007, in a controversial move, Paradise Conventions co-owner and organizer Kevin Boyd resigned from/abandoned the convention to work for Hobbystar Marketing as the Canadian guest and programming coordinator for Fan Expo Canada and other Toronto ComiCON events. Boyd claimed at the time that \\"The convention business was not successful so I decided it was time to end it. I worked on it for five years and did not receive any money for time spent on the big convention.\\". In 2008 it moved to the Holiday Inn on King, a smaller venue (21,000 square feet) that is closer to downtown Toronto. In 2009, it was announced that the show would be on hiatus in 2009 due to scheduling concerns. On June 24, 2009, via press release, Gareb Shamus, owner of Wizard Entertainment, announced that he had purchased the event from Paradise owner Peter Dixon, who would remain involved in the show in some form, in a manner similar to Wizard's purchase of the Big Apple Comic Con. The former comic book-only show will be retooled as a multi- genre event similar to other Wizard events in Philadelphia, Chicago, and New York, and relaunched in 2010. The convention seems to be officially on hiatus, as there have been no new events since 2012. In June 2014 Paradise launched a new semi-monthly one day show called the \\"Toronto Comics Show\\" and held them in a room at the Leaside Arena. Those are also currently on hiatus since Fall 2014.

History The real was currency of the Ilhas Adjacentes (Adjacent Islands) of Portugal, referring to the archipelago of the Azores and Madeira.Rita Martins de Sousa (2004), p.2 It consisted of coins and banknotes, specifically issued and circulated in those islands, but with their own surcharge. Coins were issued for the Azores until 1901 and banknotes were issued between 1895 and 1910. Although the Portuguese escudo replaced the real (1000 r√©is = 1 escudo) in 1911, the Azorean banknotes continued to circulate until 1932. Although the Madeira equivalent continued to circulated until the end of the 19th century, the Azorean real continued to appear until 1931. At that time it was discounted by 25% to the Portuguese currency. Owing to their surcharge, the island currency maintained a denomination that was inferior to the continental currency. Since the end of the 19th century there was a push to unify the currency in order to facilitate commercial exchange and eliminate barriers to free movement of cash that isolated the Azores. The proposal, supported by public officials and larger merchants, ran counter to the resistance from the local population that paid their taxes 25% greater than island currencies and who were afraid of the monetary crises that occurred during the first half of the 19th century. During these episodes local commerce was decimated and local savings in ruins. Notwithstanding its residential unpopularity, the difference in value was seen as a source of problems for commercial relations, and many sectors of the Azorean economy were interested in settling these issues. These economic pressures were in line with the ideological stance of the National Dictatorship, which was largely centralist and fanatically nationalist, and who saw the existence of an Azorean currency as an anathema. In this context, a decree-law (19869, 2 June 1931) was published to unify the currency, and imposed by Salazar, even as many taxpayers were leery of the plan. Ancillary measures were therefore adopted, under decree-law 21/189 (2 May 1932), that established a deduction for taxpayers and credits for island residents, namely those who, by law or contract, accepted the imposition of the Portuguese escudo in the archipelago. This measure was imposed without protest. The issue of an Azorean currency only reappeared in 1975, during the context of the autonomy and independentist movements, that succeeded the 25 April 1974 Carnation Revolution. It was a popular return, but became irrelevant with the Portuguese adhesion to the European Union, the growth in the regional economy, and the adoption of the Euro. The Azorean banknotes were, in general, similar to the Portuguese real, but distinguished by its 25% devaluation in comparison to the continental counterpart. The coin existed in multiple denominations specific to the Azores, and today have a larger value. Coins In the late 18th century, copper 5, 10 and 20 r√©is and silver 75, 150 and 300 r√©is coins were issued. Production of silver coins ceased in 1798. In 1829, during the Regency of Angra emergency coins were issued by Maria II on Terceira Island. These were 80 r√©is coins cast in gun or bell metal. From 1843, smaller, copper 5, 10 and 20 r√©is were issued, with the 20 r√©is ceasing in 1866 whilst the 5 and 20 r√©is continued until 1901. In both 1871 and 1887, various foreign coins were overstamped for use on the Azores. This produced denominations of 10, 20, 40, 120, 300, 600 and 1200 r√©is in 1871 and 15, 120, 300, 600 and 1200 r√©is in 1887. Banknotes The Banco de Portugal first issued paper currency in the Azores in 1876.Cuhaj (2010), p.96 In 1895, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 r√©is notes were issued by the Agencias dos A√ß√¥res. These were followed by the 1905-1910 issue Banco de Portugal notes, overstamped with \\"A√ß√¥res\\", in denominations of 2500, 5000, 10,000, 20,000 and 50,000 r√©is.

It is a translation of the German (). The most important characteristic of the period is the development of a standard written German, followed by the standardisation of the spoken language. For this reason, the term New High German is also used as a synonym for modern Standard German. Periodisation The German term was originally coined in 1819 by Jacob Grimm for the period from around 1450 to the present day, following on from Middle High German (). However, in 1878 Wilhelm Scherer proposed a transitional period, 1350‚Äì1650, for which he coined the new term (Early New High German), thus dating New High German from the mid 17th century. In spite of many alternative proposals, Scherer's remains the most widely adopted periodisation of German. The Holy Roman Empire in 1648. The geographical extent of New High German in 1910. There are both linguistic and extra-linguistic reasons for regarding the mid-17th century as the beginning of a new linguistic period. By this time, the sound changes which result in the phonological system of Modern German had been completed - no further major changes take place within the NHG period. The Thirty Years War saw the population reduced by at least one third, and the subsequent Treaty of Westphalia, signed in 1648, guaranteed the relative independence of hundreds of small and large states within the Holy Roman Empire, as well as recognizing the complete independence of the Netherlands and Switzerland. The 1641 publication of Justus Georg Schottelius's Teutsche Sprachkunst marks the beginning of the debate about a standardised national language. The New High German period is often subdivided, with a general consensus over a break in the first half of the 19th century, with another after 1945. The earliest of these periods () sees the gradual establishment of a standard written language by grammarians, lexicographers and writers; the second () sees the spread of this standard throughout the publishing media (and becoming an international language of science), into the schoolroom, and into spoken German. After 1945, the loss of German-speaking territory in the East, the decline of German as an international language, and the massive influence of English on the vocabulary are seen as markers of a new period, referred to as (\\"contemporary German\\"). These changes, however, are in the status and use of the language, while the phonology and morphology have seen only rationalisation and not substantial change over the last 370 years. Territory Current distribution areas of the German language in Europe For the first two hundred years of the period, the linguistic boundary of German remained relatively stable, even where the territory itself changed hands, as in Alsace, a French possession since the Treaty of Westphalia. The only major area of change was in the East. Initially only individual German-speaking settlers moved into the underpopulated lands of Brandenburg, Pomerania and Bohemia, but in the late 17th century both Prussia and Austria had policies of attracting settlers to these lands. From the late 19th century, however, there have been significant losses of German-speaking territory. The eastward settlement of the earlier period was reversed by a Russian government policy of Russianisation and by the resistance of the Polish population to further German immigration, causing many German speakers to return West. At the end of the Second World War the German-speaking populations of Bohemia and the land east of the Oder-Neisse line, which became part of Poland, were forcibly expelled. Characteristics The New High German period is characterised by the codification of German grammar and the development of a standard language in both writing and speech. Unlike earlier periods, there have been few major changes in phonology or morphology. Rather, the standard language has selected particular features and these choices have then exerted an influence on individual German dialects.

Brown was Leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario and Ontario's Leader of the Official Opposition from May 2015 to January 2018. Brown's political career began when he served on the Barrie City Council in the early 2000s. From 2006 until 2015, Brown was a federal Conservative Member of Parliament representing the riding of Barrie. In May 2015, Brown was elected leader of the Ontario PC Party, and stepped down as a federal MP. He then won a provincial by-election on September 3, 2015, in Simcoe North and entered the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Brown resigned as party leader in January 2018 after allegations of sexual misconduct, was expelled from the party caucus by interim leader Vic Fedeli on February 16, 2018, and left provincial politics after an aborted second run for the PC leadership Brown became the first permanent Ontario Conservative leader who did not lead the party into an election since George Frederick Marter. Brown ran for mayor of Brampton and defeated incumbent Linda Jeffrey in the 2018 municipal election. Early life and career Brown was born in Toronto of Irish and Italian descent, and raised in the Roman Catholic faith. His father, Edmond Brown, a criminal lawyer in Peel Region and former federal New Democratic Party candidate for the riding of Davenport in 1979 and 1980, was raised in England and Ireland before moving to Canada, and his mother, Judy (n√©e Tascona) Brown, is of partial Italian descent, and an educator (teacher and principal) from Barrie. He graduated from St. Michael's College School, a private Catholic school in Toronto. He studied political science at the University of Toronto, and graduated with a law degree from the University of Windsor. During his second year at law school, he was one of 10 recipients of the As Prime Minister Award. He worked for Magna International in their legal department for four years. Brown served two terms as President of the Progressive Conservative Youth Federation (PCYF), a position he held from 1998 to 2002. He also served on the executive of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario, as a vice president. As PCYF President, Brown was one of the early supporters of a united right and was criticized for his decision to support a united right from party leader Joe Clark and Member of Parliament Scott Brison. Brown was later re-elected as PCYF president with 81 percent of the vote against Jonathan Frate of Manitoba. Brown was the Deputy Chairman of the International Young Democrat Union (IYDU). He has also represented Canada on a number of international assistance projects hosted by the IYDU. Municipal politics Brown was elected to the Barrie City Council in 2000 at age 22, and was re-elected in 2003. Brown served on various Committees, including the Budget Committee. Brown's primary focus while on council was health care, despite it being a provincial responsibility. In response to a shortage of doctors, Brown founded the Physician Recruitment Task Force with the Royal Victoria Hospital to help attract more doctors to Barrie. Federal politics In the lead up to the 2004 federal election, Brown put his name forward as a candidate for the Conservative Party nomination race for the riding of Barrie. Brown defeated Rod Jackson and Douglas Edwards to win the party nomination in what Jackson considered a nasty race. In the election, he lost to Liberal incumbent Aileen Carroll by 1,295 votes. Brown ran again in 2006, this time defeating Carroll by 1,523 votes. He was re-elected in the 2008 election by 15,295 votes over Liberal candidate Rick Jones. In November 2010, the Canadian Taxpayers Federation expressed concern about how Patrick Brown used his House of Commons of Canada account. He sent flyers to his riding which included a letter of support and a flyer from Barrie City Councillor Michael Prowse. Brown used his House of Commons account to pay for the mailing because Michael Prowse could not afford to send the flyer out himself. In the 2011 election, Brown was elected to his third term in office. In 2012, it was reported that Brown had the highest publicly funded expenditures on public service announcement flyers with $81,159.97. On September 28, 2014, he announced his intention to run in the 2015 Ontario party leadership election. He registered as a leadership candidate on November 20, 2014. He said that, unlike the other candidates, he was not involved in the four consecutive losses that have kept the Ontario PCs out of power since 2003. At the time of his jump to provincial politics, he chaired the Conservative Party of Canada's Greater Toronto Area caucus and the Canada-India Parliamentary Association. Provincial politics In September 2014, Brown announced his intention to run in the contest to replace PC Party Leader, Tim Hudak. From the outset of his campaign, Brown positioned himself as an outsider, challenging the leadership of the PC Party, which had been defeated in the last four provincial elections. In the most recent election campaign, in 2014, the party election platform included a commitment to cut 100,000 public service jobs over 4 years through attrition. As the only one of the original five leadership candidates who was not a member of the Ontario legislature, Brown was not involved in the promise, which he considered ill-advised, Brown's rivals attempted to use this same lack of previous involvement in provincial politics as an argument against his leadership bid. In March, Brown emerged as the front-runner in the leadership election, having sold over 40,000 of the 70,000 memberships in the party. During the campaign, Brown was successful in bringing many new members to the party, many of whom came from ethnic communities. The past four leadership contests had been won by those who sold the most memberships. Brown was endorsed by the Campaign Life Coalition and the Ontario Landowners Association. During Brown's leadership bid both special interest groups actively supported him by selling Ontario PC Party memberships amongst their members. Brown was criticized by his main rival, Christine Elliott, for not resigning his federal seat during the leadership campaign. Brown was absent from the House of Commons for some votes during the leadership campaign, attending 56% of the votes from September to December in 2014. However, his overall attendance for votes in 2014 was 83%. A spokesperson for Prime Minister Stephen Harper confirmed that members are not expected to step down but are expected to \\"continue to fulfill their parliamentary responsibilities, including membership on committees and attendance at votes.\\" Chris Alexander in 2015.https://www.canada.ca/en/news/archive/2015/01/canada-india-continue- build-strong-economic-ties.html The campaign started with five candidates including Vic Fedeli, Lisa MacLeod, and Monte McNaughton. All three withdrew in early 2015 citing membership recruitment or financial reasons. = Progressive Conservative leader (2015‚Äì2018) = On May 9, 2015, Brown was elected leader, defeating his only remaining opponent, Christine Elliott, winning with 61.8% of the membership vote. Brown, who resigned his seat in the House of Commons on May 13, 2015, days after winning the provincial leadership, led the Progressive Conservative party from outside the legislature during most of the summer. On July 22, 2015, Garfield Dunlop agreed to step down as MPP for Simcoe North on August 1 in order to open up a seat for Brown. A provincial by-election, called for September 3, 2015, was won by Brown. Under his leadership, the Ontario PC Party won five by- elections, including two seats which had been previously held by the governing Liberals - Sault Ste. Marie and Scarborough-Rouge River. Despite his record, Brown faced accusations of corruption and favouritism over hand picked candidates and unfair nomination contests. =Sexual misconduct allegations and resignation= On January 24, 2018, Brown was accused by two women of engaging in sexual misconduct, which dated back to the time he was a federal MP. Brown denied the allegations and initially refused to step down. Four senior staff from Brown's campaign had advised him that he should resign as party leader; he did not accept their advice and consequentially the staff jointly resigned from his campaign team. After pressure from within the party, he resigned as leader in the early hours of January 25. A day later, fellow MPP, Lisa MacLeod revealed that she heard rumors about similar allegations from former National Hockey League player, Eric Lindros. Dimitri Soudas, former director of communications to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and volunteer for the campaign, suggested the allegations were baseless, saying, ‚ÄúAll media organizations were turning over every single stone that they could find, and they couldn‚Äôt find anything.‚Äù A Globe and Mail article revealed that Brown's staff had expressed similar concern with Brown's past relationships after he became leader. One of these was with Tamara Macgregor, a former staffer within Brown's office and daughter of Karma Macgregor, then former party candidate to Ottawa West‚ÄîNepean. The day after his resignation, he was succeeded on an interim basis by Nipissing MPP Vic Fedeli. Fedeli, who was unanimously elected by caucus, asked Brown to take a leave of absence from Queen's Park while he defends himself against the allegations. He added that he would not sign Brown's nomination papers if he attempted to run in a Barrie riding at the June 7 provincial election. Brown had intended on running in Barrie‚ÄîSpringwater‚ÄîOro-Medonte in that election, but Fedeli's announcement would mean that he would have to run as an independent. Four of his former advisers: PC campaign chair Walied Soliman, ex-campaign manager Andrew Boddington, ad guru Dan Robertson, and strategist Hamish Marshall, the Conservative Campaign Chair for the 43rd Federal Election threw their support towards Caroline Mulroney. In one incident, there was an allegation that Brown exposed himself to a teenager and asked her to engage in oral sex after plying her with alcohol. The accuser alleged that she was an 18-year-old high school student when the oral sex incident occurred but on February 13, 3 weeks after the first public report, she amended her claim to say she was a year older than she had previously recalled and was therefore over the legal drinking age. In the other incident, Brown was alleged to have kissed, without consent, a female aide in his employ while in his bedroom.https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/former-ontario-pc- leader-patrick-brown-says-he-is-target-of-fabricated-political- assassination/article37976333/ Brown later took a lie detector test and claimed that he felt his name was cleared. No charges have been laid as a result of either alleged incident and on April 23, 2018, he sued CTV for $8 million in damages. He then entered the PC leadership race less than one or two hours before the deadline. =Expulsion from PC caucus and brief second run for the leadership= Brown was ejected from the PC caucus on February 16, 2018, following reports that he was claiming he hadn't actually resigned as party leader and a series of Facebook posts in which he attacked the credibility of his accusers. Later that same day, Brown registered as a candidate for the Progressive Conservative leadership election, pending approval from the party, and on February 21, after being vetted, Brown was given the \\"green light\\" by the PC Party to run for the leadership. Brown officially launched his second leadership campaign on February 18 with a rally in Mississauga. On February 20, PC MPP Randy Hillier filed complaints to Ontario's Integrity Commissioner alleging that Brown had breached the province's ethics rules around down payments over his 2016 bought $2.3 million waterfront house on Lake Simcoe, a loan from a friend and undeclared travels. Currently it is on the market. On April 28, 2018, a 60-page report by the Commissioner found out that Brown breached the Member's Integrity Act four times over matters involving his personal finances, but there was insufficient evidence to find him in breach over alleged travel violations. Brown withdrew his candidacy for leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario on February 26, 2018, citing the difficulties of simultaneously running for leader while fighting against allegations against him. His withdrawal came days after the revelation that Integrity Commissioner was investigating Brown for alleged financial improprieties and several hours after a report revealing his apparent interference, while he was leader, in a Tory candidate nomination that is now being investigated by Hamilton police for fraud. Brown's supporters cited harassment against members of his family as one cause of his decision to withdraw. Brown's $100,000 registration fee was not refunded by the party. After the election of Doug Ford as the new leader of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party, there were rumors that Brown would not be allowed to run under their banner. =Departure from provincial politics= The Progressive Conservative Party's nomination committee unanimously ruled on March 15, 2018, that Patrick Brown would not be eligible to run as a PC candidate in Barrie‚ÄîSpringwater‚ÄîOro-Medonte for the June 7, 2018 election. Brown announced on Twitter shortly afterward that he would not run as an independent candidate in Barrie‚ÄîSpringwater‚ÄîOro-Medonte. It was later reported by the National Post that a Snover Dhillon, a convicted fraudster banned by the Federal Conservatives, played a role in all those nomination irregularities. Following his departure from provincial politics, Brown restarted his law practice and accepted a job as vice-president of a telecommunications company in Vaughan.  Return to municipal politics  According to reports by the National Post Brown was \\"urged\\" by supporters to run for Chair of the Regional Municipality of Peel in the 2018 Peel regional and municipal elections, the first in which the position is directly elected, although Brown himself initially declined to confirm to the Post if he would run or not. Brown registered his candidacy for Peel Regional Chair on July 3, 2018. On July 27, 2018, Brown registered his candidacy for the Brampton mayoral election following Premier Doug Ford's announcement that regional chair elections in Peel Region would be cancelled. Incumbent Brampton mayor Linda Jeffrey suggested \\"that Brown jumped into the race, and city, at the last minute in a bid to 'rehabilitate' his career\\", while Brown suggested that Jeffrey's \\"lack of leadership has contributed to rising property taxes and shootings\\" in the city.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/brampton-mayor- race-1.4865608 Brown's platform includes a \\"poverty action plan\\" that would require a minimum percentage of new housing to meet affordable standards, and rental properties being redeveloped to include equal amounts of rental spots before and after the process.https://www.bramptonguardian.com/news- story/8914204--it-s-not-adequate-patrick-brown-announces-plan-to-tackle- poverty-in-brampton/ His \\"Public Safety Initiative\\" would include more front line police officers, strengthening the mental health program, and affordable recreation for youth.https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/09/07/patrick- brown-unveils-his-plan-to-make-brampton-safer.html Brown defeated incumbent Linda Jeffrey by a narrow margin in the Brampton mayoralty race on October 22, 2018. In his acceptance speech, he thanked former Premier Bill Davis for his endorsement and said, \\"I‚Äôve got so much hope in my heart for what‚Äôs ahead for Brampton. You know why? I know we can turn this around, I know Brampton is going to be back, Brampton is going to become an economic engine\\". According to the Toronto Star, Jeffrey had the backing of \\"PC party operatives ‚Äî Doug Ford‚Äôs campaign manager organized a fundraiser for her\\".  Political views  Brown identifies himself as a \\"pragmatic conservative\\" and after becoming leader he tried to move the Ontario PC Party in a socially liberal and fiscally conservative direction. At his first Ontario PC Convention as the new leader, Brown confirmed his belief in man-made climate change and announced his support for a revenue-neutral price on carbon. Brown was also the first Ontario PC leader to march in the Toronto Pride Parade. Among his political mentors, Brown lists former Ontario Premier Bill Davis, former Quebec Premier Jean Charest and former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. Much of Brown's time at Queen's Park was spent criticizing and debating the government's energy policies. He promised to dismantle the Green Energy Act, rein in executive salaries at Hydro One, and place a moratorium on the signing of new energy contracts. Patrick Brown's first Private Member's Bill in the Ontario Legislature was Bill 136, the Estate Administration Tax Abolition Act, which was an attempt to eliminate Ontario's estate administration (probate) tax (originally introduced by the PC government of Mike Harris in 1998). The bill was supported by Brown's fellow PCs but opposed by the governing Liberals and third party New Democrats, and was voted down 51-24 on division at second reading. During his tenure as Ontario PC leader, Brown was noted for his close relationship with many of Ontario's diverse ethnic communities. He spoke in the Legislature in support of a motion condemning Islamophobia, and was one of the first Canadian politicians to refer to the Tamil Genocide. Brown has a personal relationship with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who refers to him as \\"Patrick Bhai\\" (\\"Brother Patrick\\") and named him an honorary citizen of Gujarat. His critics called him \\"policy-lite\\" since he made no policy statements during the Progressive Conservative leadership campaign. After winning the leadership race, he focused his plan on four main issues which he suggested would lead to a more prosperous province: less red tape, improved transportation corridors, affordable energy, and addressing Ontario's growing skills gap. Brown's shift of the party to the political centre stood in contrast to his time in federal politics. As a federal MP, Brown had been one of the more socially conservative members of the Conservative caucus.\\"Ontario PCs failing in sex-ed debate\\", Toronto Star, Feb 25 2015. As an MP, Brown voted to re-open the same-sex marriage and abortion debates, and also voted against legalizing euthanasia and including gender expression in the Human Rights Act. He later said those votes were to represent his constituents. Brown said that he didn't intend to revisit any of these issues in the provincial legislature.  Personal life  Brown's wife, Genevieve Gualtieri, is currently working with the SickKids Foundation. She is the niece of current Progressive Conservative MPP Rudy Cuzzetto who represents Mississauga‚ÄîLakeshore. They lived in the Lorne Park neighbourhood of Mississauga, but simultaneously had a lease in Brampton; they have since moved within the city. In July 2019 the couple announced the birth of their first child, a boy. Brown is the nephew of Joe Tascona, a former Progressive Conservative MPP who represented Barrie‚ÄîSimcoe‚ÄîBradford.http://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias- almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/tascona-joseph-n-bahons-mba-llb-barrie-simcoe- bradford =Book= After his forced resignation, Brown penned a book called Takedown: The Attempted Political Assassination of Patrick Brown. The book was released as scheduled, in October 2018, which happened to be after Brown won the mayoralty of Brampton. There was negative reaction to the release from the Ontario provincial government of Doug Ford, and from the previous incumbent, Linda Jeffrey.

Around 80% to 90% of the Teskeys in the world today are descended from the ‚ÄúIrish Palatine‚Äù family of that name, founded by the man now referred to as Jacob Teskey, or Jacob 1659 (after his apparent year of birth). The term ‚ÄúIrish Palatine‚Äù was given to families that left the German Pfalz (also known as the Southern or Rhenish Palatinate) in 1709 and eventually settled in Ireland. Around 100 of these German-speaking families settled on the Southwell estate near Rathkeale in County Limerick. Amongst them was Jacob, with his wife and two sons. The Teskey spelling first appeared in Ireland a few years after 1709. There has been much conjecture as to the original spelling before the family migrated to Ireland, and indeed much speculation about their specific place of origin. During their arduous and eventful migration the family was recorded as Feske in Rotterdam and Teske in London. After settling in Ireland they were recorded as Teshine in 1715, but soon afterwards the name seemed to become settled as Teskey. In 2004 Hank Jones, a leading researcher into Irish Palatine family history, put forward a strong argument that before 1709 the family lived in a village called Osthofen, one mile from the west bank of the River Rhine and five miles north of the city of Worms. There, the 'founder' Teskey, Jacob 1659, was recorded as Jacob Tesch. This theory is based on somewhat circumstantial evidence, but all other theories have been purely conjecture. During the great Irish migrations, especially from around 1840 until the early 20th century, several members of this Irish Palatine branch of the Teskey family emigrated to Canada, the northeastern United States, England and Australia. The migration continued later to many parts of the world. Today the greatest concentration of Teskeys is in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. However, there are still Teskeys, descendants of the first Teskey family, living and farming in the area of the original Palatine settlements near Rathkeale, Co. Limerick. In the 19th century a branch of the family moved from Rathkeale to nearby Adare, where they were recorded as Tuskey. The Irish who migrated to North America in the 19th century included both Teskeys and the related Tuskeys. Today both spellings can be found in Canada and the USA. Research into people with the name Tuskey might conclude that they too are mostly descended from Jacob 1659 Teskey. In addition to the major group of related Teskeys, there are other families bearing the name, mostly in Canada and the USA. These are the descendants from a number of immigrants who did not come from Ireland. They include at least two families who came directly from Germany with the name Teske and another originally called Teschke. A family from Russia was originally Tesske, whilst the families Tzrebietowski, Tyski and Tutzke came originally from Poland. A Tutefski emigrated from Romania and the origin of the Titieskey branch remains a mystery. All are known to have changed their name to Teskey either upon immigration or shortly afterwards. The largest of these non-Irish Teskey families comprises descendants of Stephen 1815 and Johanna, who came from Prussia and settled with their family in Collingwood, Ontario some time before the 1871 Census. Then their name was recorded as Teske; in the 1881 census it was Tesky; and by the 20th century it had become established as Teskey. The wife of Canada's Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015, Stephen Harper, is Laureen Teskey. Her ancestry has been traced back to the Irish Palatine Teskeys. The popular Australian group, The Teskey Brothers, includes two Teskey brothers who descend from the Irish Palatine Teskeys. This article was submitted by Ken McDonald, whose late mother was born Doreen Teskey in England in 1914. He has researched the family since 1989, corresponded with more than 500 family members and met more than 600. He most recently reviewed the article in December 2019.

Borchard was the 12th pick of the first round in the 2000 Major League Baseball Draft out of Stanford University by the Chicago White Sox. In high school, he won a division III state football championship at Adolfo Camarillo High School as the starting quarterback. He also played quarterback for Stanford and took a $5.3 million signing bonus to play for the White Sox. The signing bonus was the highest ever given to a player for a minor league contract until Justin Upton received $6.1 million to sign with the Arizona Diamondbacks in . College Borchard posted extremely impressive numbers while at Stanford University, both as an outfielder and a quarterback. =Football= In 1998 Borchard was the Cardinal backup quarterback behind Todd Husak and played in seven games in which he tallied 317 yards and three touchdowns. In 1999 Borchard completed 42-of-71 passes for 747 yards and seven touchdowns and led the Pac-10 with a 177.3 pass efficiency rating, but did not have enough attempts to qualify for the national statistics. He made national headlines after his performance against UCLA in a relief role after Husak left the game with bruised ribs early in the second quarter. Borchard came on and threw for 324 yards and five touchdowns and was named USA Today's National Player of the Week for his effort. The five TD passes in a game tied Borchard with several others for the second most in school history. The following week, with Husak sidelined, Borchard made his starting debut against San Jose State and threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns and also rushed for one score. =Baseball= Joe was a twice named to the First-Team All-Pac-10 in 1999 and 2000. Stanford's website claims him to be \\"among the best players in the history of Stanford baseball.\\" In three seasons, he hit 40 home runs with 187 RBI and a .346 batting average. In the Cardinal record book, he ranks eighth in home runs and batting average and ninth in RBI. Professional baseball Borchard's career with the White Sox was less than impressive, as he struggled to make consistent contact, an issue that plagued him throughout his career. Borchard's most significant big league playing time came in the season, where he received 201 at-bats. He hit .174 that year with 9 home runs and 20 RBI. Borchard's most notable feat was setting the US Cellular Field home run distance record, yet to be eclipsed at 504 feet off Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Brett Myers. Borchard was traded to the Seattle Mariners on March 20, , for Matt Thornton, a left-handed relief pitcher. On May 3, 2006, the Florida Marlins claimed Borchard off waivers. The Atlanta Braves signed Borchard to a minor league contract during the 2007 MLB winter meetings in Nashville, Tennessee. On May 28, , Borchard had season ending Tommy John surgery, but was re-signed by the Braves for the season. However, on April 24, Borchard was released. On May 28, 2009 Borchard signed with the Giants. He played for the organization's AAA affiliate, the Fresno Grizzlies, for the next two years. On May 3, 2010, he became the second Grizzly to hit for the cycle (joining Nate Schierholtz) when he went five for six in the Grizzlies' 14‚Äì4 victory over the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.

Early life Gregg was born in Columbia, South Carolina, the great-grandson of Esek Hopkins, commodore of the Continental Navy, and grandson of Jonathan Maxcy first president of South Carolina College (now called the University of South Carolina), where Gregg would later attend and graduate first in his class. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1839, practiced law with his father, and was a very respected member of Columbia society. His first military experience came as a major in the 12th U.S. Infantry in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, but did not arrive in time to participate in any of the major battles. Gregg had many scholarly pursuits, including astronomy, botany, ornithology, and languages, and owned his own private observatory. Maxcy Gregg was a strong advocate of states rights his entire life, one of the South Carolina Fire- Eaters. He was a member of the 1860 convention which determined the secession of South Carolina. He was also a lifelong bachelor. Civil War Gregg was a major proponent of secession prior to the commencement of the Civil War. In 1858, he issued the secessionists' manifesto in a pamphlet entitled, \\"An Appeal to the State Rights Party of South Carolina.\\" In it, Gregg argued that Carolinians had looked unfavorably upon and rejected incorporation into the Democratic Party since the tariff controversy. Andrew P. Calhoun, James Tradewell, A.C. Garlington, and W.E. Martin also contributed statements to the \\"Appeal.\\"Manisha Sinha, The Counter-Revolution of Slavery: Politics and Ideology in Antebellum South Carolina (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000), 193. When South Carolina seceded from the Union in December 1860, Gregg helped organize the 1st South Carolina Volunteers, and served as the regiment's first colonel. He became a brigadier general and served in A. P. Hill's Light Division. His brigade played a prominent role in Hill's assault on the Union lines at the Battle of Gaines' Mill. Gregg gained prominence at the Second Battle of Bull Run when his men repulsed six Union assaults, and he served in Robert E. Lee's Maryland Campaign. At Antietam he was wounded in the thigh by the same bullet that killed Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch. Death At Fredericksburg, Union Maj. Gen. George Meade's troops penetrated the lines of the Light Division. Gregg's brigade was caught by surprise, and in the confusion he was shot in the back. Gregg was found by a group of staff officers and taken to a field hospital in the rear. An examination of the wound found that the bullet had penetrated his spine. Gregg was unable to feel anything in his lower body and assumed he was completely paralyzed from the waist down, but after being placed in bed he managed to regain some feeling in his legs. However, doctors pronounced the wound mortal, and Gregg died on December 15, saying on his deathbed \\"I yield my life cheerfully, fighting for the independence of South Carolina.\\" Stonewall Jackson, who had previously quarreled with Gregg, came to see him on his deathbed https://www.flickr.com/photos/moyersteam/15453800947 In popular media He was portrayed by actor Buck Taylor in the 2003 film Gods and Generals.

It has relevance to naturalism and physicalism in philosophy, and to philosophy of mind. Overview Physicalism, in at least one rough sense, is the claim that the entire world may be described and explained using the laws of nature, in other words, that all phenomena are natural phenomena. This leaves open the question of what is 'natural', but one common understanding of the claim is that everything in the world is ultimately explicable in the terms of physics. This is known as reductive physicalism. However, this type of physicalism in its turn leaves open the question of what we are to consider as the proper terms of physics. There seem to be two options here, and these options form the horns of Hempel's dilemma, because neither seems satisfactory. On the one hand, we may define the physical as whatever is currently explained by our best physical theories, e.g., quantum mechanics, general relativity. Though many would find this definition unsatisfactory, some would accept that we have at least a general understanding of the physical based on these theories, and can use them to assess what is physical and what is not. And therein lies the rub, as a worked-out explanation of mentality currently lies outside the scope of such theories. On the other hand, if we say that some future, \\"ideal\\" physics is what is meant, then the claim is rather empty, for we have no idea of what this means. The \\"ideal\\" physics may even come to define what we think of as mental as part of the physical world. In effect, physicalism by this second account becomes the circular claim that all phenomena are explicable in terms of physics because physics properly defined is whatever explains all phenomena. Beenakker has proposedCarlo Beenakker (2007), \\"Hempel's dilemma and the physics of computation\\" to resolve Hempel's dilemma with the definition: \\"The boundary between physics and metaphysics is the boundary between what can and what cannot be computed in the age of the universe\\". Hempel's dilemma is relevant to philosophy of mind because explanations of issues such as consciousness, representation, and intentionality are very hard to come by using current physics, although many people in philosophy (and other fields such as cognitive science, psychology, and neuroscience) hold to physicalism.

Since its adoption the Monterrey Consensus has become the major reference point for international development cooperation. The document embraces six areas of Financing for Development: # Mobilizing domestic financial resources for development. # Mobilizing international resources for development: foreign direct investment and other private flows. # International Trade as an engine for development. # Increasing international financial and technical cooperation for development. # External Debt. # Addressing systemic issues: enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in support of development. Some critics suggest that the US has ignored the Monterrey Consensus because the amount of US official development assistance (0.18% of its gross domestic product in 2008), is still well below the 0.7% target, which it endorsed in the Consensus.http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DatasetCode=ODA_DONOR It is much lower than some other developed countries, especially those in Northern Europe. The United Kingdom, for example, reached its target of giving at least 0.7% of GNI in official aid in 2014. The Monterrey Consensus was updated at Doha, Qatar in 2008, and again at Addis Ababa in 2015. 2008 Follow-up Conference in Doha, Qatar The Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus (Doha,Qatar, 28 November - 2 December 2008) was attended by some 40 Heads of State or Government, 9 Deputy Heads of State or Government, 50 ministers and 17 vice-ministers of foreign affairs, finance, development cooperation and trade, as well as other high-level officials of 170 States and major institutional stakeholders.See http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/CONF.212/7‚ü™=E Doha Declaration Following intense intergovernmental negotiations, the Conference concluded with the adoption of the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development (http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/doha/documents/Doha_Declaration_FFD.pdf). The two key messages included in the document were a strong commitment by developed countries to maintain their Official Development Assistance (ODA) targets irrespective of the current financial crisis, and a decision to hold a UN Conference at the highest level on the impact of the current financial and economic crisis on development. Other main highlights of the Doha Declaration are: Domestic resource mobilization: the importance of national ownership of development strategies and of an inclusive financial sector, as well as the need for strong policies on good governance, accountability, gender equality and human development. Mobilizing international resources for development: the need to improve the enabling environment and to expand the reach of private flows to a greater number of developing countries. International trade as an engine for development: the importance of concluding the Doha round of multilateral trade negotiations as soon as possible. External debt: the need to strengthen crisis prevention mechanisms and to consider enhanced approaches for debt restructuring mechanisms. Addressing systemic issues: the need to review existing global economic governance arrangements, with a view to comprehensive reforms of the international financial system and institutions. Plenary meetings The Conference was chaired by the Emir of Qatar and included seven plenary meetings. A total of 133 Governments made statements to the plenary. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the General Assembly, the Director-General of WTO, the Secretary-General of UNCTAD and the Administrator of UNDP spoke at the opening. In their statements, Member States took stock of the progress made in the implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, identified obstacles and constraints encountered and put forward ideas and proposals to overcome these difficulties. Many statements focused on the consequences of the global financial crisis for development and the need for bold and urgent measures to address them. Much attention was also devoted to the food and energy crises and to the untapped potential of innovative sources of finance. Amb. Oscar de Rojas, a former Venezuelan diplomat and Director of the U.N.'s Financing for Development Office, served as Executive Secretary of both the Doha and Monterrey conferences. Round tables Six interactive multi-stakeholder round tables were held concurrently with the plenary meetings, centering on the six thematic areas of the Monterey Consensus. Each round table was co-chaired by two Heads of State or Government and ministers from developing and developed countries and moderated by a high- level official of the major institutional stakeholders. Panelists included HRH Princess Maxima of the Netherlands; S-G‚Äôs Special Envoys for the Conference, Mr. Trevor Manuel, South African Finance Minister and Ms. Heidemarie Weiczorek-Zeul, German Minister for Development Cooperation. Following presentations by panelists, interactive discussions took place among representatives of Member States, inter-governmental organizations, UN agencies, civil society and the business sector. Pre-conference events The Conference was preceded by a high-level retreat on the global financial crisis, hosted on 28 November by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Emir of Qatar. The retreat was attended by some 30 Heads of State or Government and ministers from both developed and developing countries, as well as high-level representatives of the major institutional stakeholders. The retreat was meant to serve as a ‚Äúbridge‚Äù between the discussions on the financial crisis that had taken place among smaller groups of countries and the wider membership of the United Nations. A Global Forum of Civil Society was held from 26 to 27 November on the theme ‚ÄúInvesting in people-centered development‚Äù and attracted participation of more than 250 civil society organizations and networks. In addition, an International Business Forum, held on 28 November focused on mobilizing private sector resources for development and was attended by more than 200 participants from the private sector. Side events More than 50 side events took place at the Conference site. In the spirit of Monterrey, the organizers were Governments, inter-governmental and non-governmental organizations and the business sector. The issues of inclusive and innovative financing for development featured prominently in several side events. High-level speakers included: HRH Princess Maxima of the Netherlands, the President of Tanzania.

The meeting was also marked by the absence of the heads of the Bretton Woods institutions (World Bank and IMF). The United States aid chief still thought the meeting was worthwhile, and welcomed the outcome. Other, such as the Eurodad network criticised it. * Conference website: http://www.un.org/esa/ffd/doha/ 2015 - Third international Conference in Addis Ababa The Third International Conference on Financing for Development was held in Addis Ababa from 13 to 16 July 2015.

The 1949 Chieftain and Streamliner models were the first all new car designs to come from Pontiac in the post World War II years. Previous cars had been 1942 models with minor revisions. First Generation (1949‚Äì1954) In 1949 the A-body Chieftain replaced the Pontiac Torpedo as Pontiac's smaller and lower priced model. However, the newly redesigned B-bodied Pontiac Streamliner was now very similar (if not exact) in dimensions, engines, trim levels and options. This was the first time since 1934 that all Pontiacs had the same wheelbase. They had standard automatic interior lighting. The Chieftain was initially introduced with four models: Sedan, Sedan Coupe, Business Coupe, and Deluxe Convertible Coupe. In 1950, a Catalina Coupe was added to the range while a station wagon was added in 1952, with the demise of the top of the line Streamliner wagon.John Gunnell, Standard Catalog of American Cars 1946‚Äì1975, Revised 4th Edition, pages 695-708 1949 Chieftains came with a choice of four engines: * a 239.2 cu in L-head 6-cylinder engine making at 3400 rpm * a 239.2 cu in L-head 6-cylinder engine making at 3400 rpm * a 248.9 cu in L-head 8-cylinder making at 3800 rpm * a 248.9 cu in L-head 8-cylinder making at 3800 rpm The horsepower differences between each of the 6- and 8-cylinder engines were due to changes in compression ratios. Some of the more interesting optional items available for the first generation Chieftain included a radio with seven vacuum tubes, tissue dispenser, under seat heaters, and a Remington Auto-Home shaver. In 1951, the horsepower on the 8-cylinder rose to 116. The Chieftain came with a gas gauge, ammeter, oil pressure gauge, and a temperature gauge which had marks for 160, 180, and 220 degrees Fahrenheit. For the 1952 model year, Pontiac discontinued the Streamliner leaving the Chieftain as their only offering. The Chieftain continued with the 120 inch wheelbase. Engine offerings were basically the same except for the 8-cylinder which got a .2 cubic inch enlargement. Horsepower did increase by 10 on the 6-cylinder and by 15 on the 8-cylinder. Also, a red light to remind the driver that the parking brake was on was new. In the May 1952 issue of Popular Mechanics, the Chieftain was rated 14.9 seconds for a 0-60 mph time. Front head room was 36 inches, while rear head room was 35.75 inches. In 1953, Pontiac came with a new body style. An offering a 122-inch wheelbase, and sleeker lines. The windshield was now a one piece, and a standard \\"panoramic\\" windshield Adorned the rear for all models. Pontiacs sported accentuated bubbled up fins in the rear for the first time in 1953. The six-cylinder engine was standard. There was a less equipped Chieftain Special and the better equipped Chieftain Deluxe line, as well as the Custom Catalina two-door hardtop coupe. A light-up plastic Chief Pontiac hood ornament that illuminated when the headlights were on adorned the front end. The Star Chief was added to the Pontiac line in 1954 and the Chieftain was moved down to entry level status. Both cars were built on the A-body shell but the new Star Chief had an extension added to its frame. Also in 1954, 8-cylinder engines increased by about nine horsepower due to carburetor changes, up to for the manual and for the Hydra-Matic. The 6-cylinder engines remained unchanged.Gunnell (2012), p. 73 Pontiac was the last GM division to abandon its prewar inline eight engines as Oldsmobile and Cadillac had adopted modern OHV V8s in 1949 and Buick in 1953. The 1953-54 Pontiacs had been meant for the division's new OHV 287 V8, however Buick division managers succeeded in delaying its launch until 1955 to avoid upstaging their \\"Nailhead\\" Buick V8. Partially because of competition from Chevrolet, Oldsmobile, and Buick, and partially because Pontiac still lacked a V8, total sales fell by 30% in 1954. Also in 1954, power brakes, \\"power lift\\" windows (only for the front doors), as well as air-conditioning were offered as extra cost options for the first time.http://oldcarbrochures.org/July%202020/1954%20Pontiac%20Accessories/slides/1954%20Pontiac%20Accessories- Side%20B.html The 1954 Pontiacs have the distinction of the first production car in the US to have an air conditioning system in the modern sense with in- dash controls. In addition, a far more responsive and fully adjustable front seat was added.

The engine was the biggest news as this was Pontiac's first V8. The engine made 173 or at 4400 rpm depending on which version was ordered (again, the difference was due to changes in compression ratios). Six cylinder models did not return and the 1955 lineup was V8-only. A six-cylinder model had been considered, but Pontiac management decided not to retain it due to slow sales‚Äîsix-cylinder Pontiacs had accounted for only around 10-15% of volume since 1951. The traditional appearance five-chrome strips running down the hood and trunk were updated with a twin-stripe design. The biggest change for 1956 was again in the engine. The new for 1955 V8 was drastically enlarged to . Horsepower made a considerable increase, jumping to 192 and 205 respectively. Otherwise, the 1956 model Chieftains received only minor updates. A padded safety dashboard was added as an option. Sales for 1956 fell off by as much as 20% over record-setting 1955, in part due to tighter credit guidelines instituted by American banks that year. New \\"Star Flight\\" styling graced the 1957 Chieftains. This new theme included missile shaped side trim, extended rear fenders with V-shaped tips, lower hoods and massive bumpers. A new Super Chief sub-series debuted within the Chieftain line. These were the meant to be the top of the line Chieftain models. Sales were 58.02% of all Pontiacs in 1957. The first \\"Tri-Power\\" Pontiac engines were offered. Once again the Pontiac V8 was enlarged. The 1957 model year saw the engine increase to , with horsepower increasing to 290 for the Chieftain models. This generation didn't experience the popularity as much as the Chevrolet Tri-Five during the same years, even though the models were very similar. =Australian production= The 1957 Pontiac, badged as the Pontiac Super Chief, was also assembled in Australia, by General Motors-Holden.Norm Darwin, 100 Years of GM in Australia, 2002, pages 150-151 File:1956 Pontiac Chieftain 2-door sedan, rear left.jpg1956 Pontiac Chieftain two-door sedan File:1957 Pontiac Chieftain at Slee Betondorp.jpg1957 Pontiac Chieftain four-door sedan File:1957 Pontiac Chieftain (29689701332).jpg1957 Pontiac Chieftain Two-Door Catalina Third Generation (1958) Chieftains went through another major styling change in 1958. All models were given honeycomb grilles, quad head and tail lamps, concave rear fenders, and longer, lower lines, but the traditional chrome streak installed on the hood and trunk was no longer used on all Pontiacs starting in 1958. The Super Chief sub-series was promoted to full model status leaving just the standard array of Chieftains as the entry level Pontiac. The \\"Sportable\\" transistor radio became an option (a portable, removable radio), along with air-suspension and a limited slip differential.http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac/1958%20Pontiac%20Prestige%20Brochure/b_1958%20Pontiac%20Prestige-26-27.jpg As in years past, the V8 engine was enlarged. For 1958 it grew to and made and depending on version. The 1958 models were the last Chieftains to be produced. It was replaced with the all-new Catalina in 1959.

His death, while Lord Chief Justice of Ireland, is recorded in Athlone by the Annals of the Four Masters under the year 1210 and his remains lie today in Abbeylara's Cistercian abbey. He was granted the feudal barony of Moyashel. Descendants Riste√°rd de Ti√∫it had two sons who survived him, Riste√°rd 'Dubh' de Ti√∫it, the eldest son and heir to the title and lands, and Muiris. Lodge's Peerage says that it was this Riste√°rd, Riste√°rd Dubh, who established the monastery at Granard about 1210 and at this time Riste√°rd Dubh already held the manors of Kilalton and Demar, and was enfeoffed in that of Kilstir in Meath. Muiris became Lord of Jordanstown and had four sons who survived him, Tom√°s (Thomas), Piaras, Matthew and Ruair√≠ (Roger).John Lodge, Peerage of Ireland, Volume 3, 1789, pages 25-28 Sir Riste√°rd de Ti√∫it held lands at Ballyloughloe in 1342, when he was arrested on suspicion of treason.Otway-Ruthven, A.J History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 p. 258 De Ti√∫it is also the ancestor of those who bear the de Ti√∫it/ Tuite surname. He is variously recorded as Ti√∫it, Di√∫it and Tuit. Numerous placenames in Meath (Tuiterath), Cavan (Droim Thi√∫it/ Drumyouth), Westmeath (Tuitestown in Fore; Tuitestown in Moyashel and Magheradernon, and Ballysallagh Tuite), Kilkenny (Baile an Ti√∫igh Thoir/ Tuitestown and Baile an Ti√∫igh Beag/ Tuitestown Little) and elsewhere are named after him and his descendants. The surname may be from the Eure region of Normandy where the root, Tuit (generally spelled Thuit as a single or first element), indicates a clearing in a wooded area and represents the local development of the Old Norse word thveit (also written √æveit), but sometimes from Old Danish thwƒìt, brought by the Scandinavians when they settled in Normandy√Öse Kari H.

The nomenclature is a play of words on the Brazilian music style, bossa nova.  Experiment  In the particular experiment when a bosenova was first detected, transitioning the self-interaction from repulsive to attractive caused the BEC to implode and shrink to a size smaller than the optical detector's minimum resolution limit, and then suddenly \\"explode.\\" In this explosion, about half of the atoms in the condensate superficially seemed to have \\"disappeared\\" from the experiment altogether, i.e., they were not detected in either the cold particle remnants nor in the expanding gas cloud produced. Under current BEC theory, which only very crudely accounts for the interactions between the particles composing the BEC, the bosenova phenomenon remains unexplained, because the energy available to the individual atoms of the condensate near absolute zero appears to be insufficient to cause the observed implosion. However, subsequent mean-field theories have been proposed to explain bosenovas as a collective phenomenon. The bosenova behaviour of a BEC may provide insights into the behavior of a neutron star, as well as into the possible properties of still-hypothetical boson stars and into the quantum theory of \\"collective phenomena\\" in general.

Biography  The grandson of Ivy Low and Maxim Litvinov, Joseph Stalin's foreign minister during the 1930s, Pavel Litvinov was raised amongst the Soviet elite. As a schoolboy, he was devoted to the cult of Stalin, and was tapped, unsuccessfully, by the KGB to report on his parents Flora and Misha Litvinov (a story that is related by the journalist David Remnick in his book Lenin's Tomb). After the death of Joseph Stalin in 1953 and the return of family friends from the labor camps, Pavel grew disillusioned with the Soviet system. He had a short-lived marriage when he was 17. While in his 20s, he became a physics teacher at the Institute for Chemical Technology. During his time at the Institute, Litvinov became acquainted with a group of intellectuals who were following the show-trials of the dissidents Andrei Sinyavsky and Yuli Daniel. His immersion in samizdat literature at this time brought him into contact with the works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Varlam Shalamov and Robert Conquest. When writers Alexander Ginzburg and Yuri Galanskov were tried for publishing samizdat in 1967, Pavel Litvinov and Larisa Bogoraz released their famous \\"Appeal to World Public Opinion\\", appealing to the international public to protest against the closed trial. Over the following years, Litvinov became active in the dissident civil rights movement and was an editor of its regular samizdat bulletin Chronicle of Current Events. The periodical, founded in 1968, documented searches, arrests, and court proceedings in Russia and other Soviet states. The historical banner of the Red Square demonstrators, For your freedom and ours. Litvinov was one of the participants in the 1968 Red Square demonstration against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (see Prague Spring), that had taken place four days earlier. Among the others were Larisa Bogoraz, a philologist, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, a poet, Vadim Delaunay, poet, Viktor Fainberg, an art critic, and Vladimir Dremlyuga, history student. They raised banners in Czech and Russian, expressing support of the Czechoslovak independence and solidarity with Alexander Dubƒçek, the Czechoslovak leader who was the architect of the Prague Spring. The KGB promptly arrested the protesters, brutally beat them, and their secret trial was held that October. Litvinov was sentenced to five years' exile in Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai, Siberia. In 1974, after his return from exile, he and his wife Maya left the Soviet Union to Vienna by train and from there to Rome until they moved to United States. In New York, he joined fellow √©migr√© dissident Valery Chalidze in publishing A Chronicle of Human Rights in the USSR, which documented political repression. Litvinov currently lives in the United States, where he taught physics and mathematics at the Hackley School in Tarrytown, New York from 1976 until his retirement in 2006.Hackley School e-Connect newsletter, June 2, 2006 , accessed July 23, 2007.  Other  Pavel Litvinov is a son-in-law of the dissident and literary scholar Lev Kopelev. His son Dima Litvinov is an environmental activist with Greenpeace. In 2013, he was arrested as part of the Greenpeace Arctic Sunrise ship case. Pavel Litvinov is a member of the board of the Andrey Sakharov Foundation.

He straddles the line between the Renaissance and Baroque eras. Biography Ferrabosco was born at Greenwich, the illegitimate son of the Italian composer Alfonso Ferrabosco the elder. His mother might have been Susanna Symons, whom Alfonso the elder later married. Ferrabosco the younger was left under the guardianship of Gomer van Awsterwyke, a member of Queen Elizabeth I's court. Although Alfonso the elder asked for Alfonso the younger to be sent to him in Italy, where he had moved with his wife, the Queen insisted that he stay in England. Ferrabosco remained in Gomer van Awsterwyke's care until Awsterwyke's death in 1592. At this time he started a long career as a court musician, including as the private music tutor of Prince Henry.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 611. A poem addressed to Ferrabosco from Jonson in the former's Book of Ayres. Ferrabosco collaborated with Ben Jonson on several projects, including The Masque of Blackness (1605), and wrote music for several other masques besides. His music was published by John Browne in 1609, including a number of settings of poems by John Donne and Thomas Campion, as well as lute and viol music. He frequently wrote in the new declamatory Baroque style, and although he never went to Italy, he was well aware of contemporary Italian music. Ferrabosco the younger's reputation was built largely on his prowess as a viol player, and even more so his compositions for viol consort. These were highly idiomatic works, with many divisions, and virtuosic lines. He also wrote many In Nomines, which were great examples of that popular genre, without the pedantic bent many later In nomines possessed. Ferrabosco was also one of the first to write lyra viol music in tablature, along with Coprario, and wrote a book of Lessons for the lyra viol. Ferrabosco continually had difficulty with debts, and was involved in an unsuccessful scheme involving various rights on the River Thames, including dredging it for gravel, and imposing fines on people who caused a nuisance on it. He died in March 1628 and was buried at St Alfege Church on the 11th of that month, in his home village of Greenwich. Family In January 1612 Ferrabosco the younger married Ellen (died 1638) (daughter of Nicholas Lanier (c. 1523‚Äì1612) and his second wife Lucretia). they had three notable sons: Alfonso Ferrabosco (died 1652), Henry Ferrabosco (died c. 1658), and John Ferrabosco (baptised 1626, died 1682) all of whom were musicians. Two of his daughters are known to have married musicians: Elizabeth married George Bunckley, and Catherine married Edward Coleman. Coleman was a court musician after the Restoration. They were friends of Samuel Pepys and both of them are known to have sung in theatre productions.

Location YMCA camp Menogyn is situated on Bearskin Lake, in the Arrowhead region of Northeastern Minnesota. Camp literature states that the word Menogyn is derived from the native language of the Ojibway people, and in translation, means \\"to grow more fully.\\" Founded in 1922, Menogyn is administered by the Camping Services of the YMCA of Minneapolis, along with camps Icaghowan, Ihduhapi, and Warren. Menogyn is located on the border of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCAW). Menogyn is not accessible by automobile, and nearly all visitors reach camp by crossing West Bearskin Lake. Menogyn's physical location and facilities are used almost exclusively as a base camp where small groups are outfitted for their wilderness trip, logistics are arranged, and groups are welcomed upon their return. Exceptions include programming during the off season (September through May), when Menogyn is often used as a base camp for day trips and shorter overnight trips in the surrounding wilderness. In addition, Menogyn offers introduction to winter wilderness weekends, which include dog sledding, cross-country skiing, and snowshoeing. Programs Menogyn staff lead groups, usually of four to six campers, on wilderness canoeing, backpacking, and rock climbing trips. Combination trips are also offered. Canoe sessions of 8 to 15 days visit the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, while 8- to 14-day backpacking sessions utilize the nearby Superior Hiking Trail and Isle Royale National Park. Rock climbing sessions climb at sites at Tettegouche State Park, on the Superior Hiking Trail, and within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. In order to provide young people with ongoing and appropriate levels of challenge in their wilderness experiences, Menogyn offers a series of invitation-only trips. Youth who exemplify the YMCA core values of respect, honesty, caring, and responsibility are invited on these trips upon the recommendation of their counselors. These trips range from 21-day sessions (canoeing in Quetico Provincial Park of Ontario, as well as backpacking in Yellowstone National Park and in the Rocky Mountains), to Nor'Wester sessions of 30‚Äì31 days. Nor'Wester sessions take their name from the French-Canadian voyageurs of the late 18th and 19th centuries, whose part in the fur trade took them Northwest of the Laurentian Divide (separating the watersheds of Lake Superior and Hudson Bay). Nor'Wester canoe sessions travel wilderness waterways of northern Manitoba and Ontario, and backpack Nor'Westers have traveled to different wilderness areas of the Rocky Mountains. Nor'Wester sessions are designed to offer greater challenge and responsibility to their participants, who also learn new skills such as the navigation of class I-II whitewater for canoe Nor'Westers. The culmination of Menogyn's invitation-only long trips is a series of 50-day sessions that travel in some of the most remote and austerely beautiful wilderness areas of North America. Canoe sessions include Hommes du Nord (Men of the North) and Femmes du Nord (Women of the North), which choose historic wilderness rivers of Canada's Far North. Backpack sessions include the Wahkanee (for young women) and Waputik (for young men) trips, which like Menogyn, take their names from the first people of Menogyn's area. Wahkanee, for example, translates loosely into \\"sacred walk across the land.\\" Special programs include a wood canvas canoe building program as well as a cedar strip building program, started and run by compassionate employees of the camp. The designs are adaptations of what the camp has been using for 80 years, and culminates into the best craft for the job. Currently the camp has 3 cedar strip canoes with one in progress, and then a fleet of 17 wood canvas canoes with another in progress. People YMCA Camp Menogyn employs three full-time, year-round staff, in the positions of Director, Program Director, and Caretaker, as well as a summer staff of approximately 40 people. Summer staff includes trail counselors, or guides, who work directly with youth to facilitate wilderness travel experiences, as well as in-camp support staff. Support staff include a Trips Coordinator who manages equipment and travel logistics, a Trail Department coordinator who oversees the packing out of food for all Menogyn's trips, a kitchen staff of four cooks who provide made-from-scratch, family- style meals that are a camp signature, a Canoe Master, charged with the upkeep and repair of Menogyn's fleet of classic cedar-canvas, whitewater, and aluminum canoes, as well as the rotating volunteer position of Health Officer, a Registered Nurse or Medical Doctor who oversees the physical well-being of campers and staff.

Though mostly unknown to later American writers, his short story \\"Le Mul√¢tre\\" (\\"The Mulatto\\") is the earliest known work of fiction by a Creole author.Victor S√©jour, Philip Barnard (translator). \\"The Mulatto.\\" In Nellie Y. McKay and Henry Louis Gates (eds), The Norton Anthology of African American Literature, Second edition, Norton, 2004. Life On 2 June 1817 Juan Victor S√©jour was born in New Orleans to Fran√ßois Marcou, a free mulatto father from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), and Eloisa Philippe Ferrand, a New Orleans quadroon. His parents were wealthy, and had him educated in a private school. At the age of nineteen he moved to Paris to continue his education and find work. There he met members of the Parisian literary elite, including Cyrille Bissette, publisher of the black- owned journal La Revue des Colonies. Bisette published \\"Le Mul√¢tre\\", S√©jour's first work, in 1837. The story of a loyal slave exacting revenge on his cruel master/father for the death of his wife, \\"Le Mul√¢tre\\" contains an indictment of New World slavery that is found in none of S√©jour's subsequent work. S√©jour then turned away from written fiction, and composed an ode to Napoleon in 1841 and the verse drama The Jew of Seville in 1844. The latter cemented his reputation as a playwright; he went on to write Richard III, a Shakespeare- inspired costume drama about Richard III of England, that became S√©jour's most acclaimed work. Towards the end of his life, however, S√©jour's plays fell out of favor, resulting in a decline in his status. Written in French, \\"Le Mul√¢tre\\" had little effect on American literature, and was not even translated into English until the late 20th century. Its condemnation of slavery, however, anticipates the work of later African-American writers such as Frederick Douglass and William Wells Brown. The Brown Overcoat (1858) S√©jour tended to leave racism discussions out of his plays, as exemplified by his play The Brown Overcoat. It was a typical artificial comedy of the time period with witty comments and puns; however, it has nothing to do with race or greater issues of the world. This being so, S√©jour is still known as a great African-American playwright who led a successful career.

XVI: G1, I, mm. 58-80 .Benward & Saker (2009). Music in Theory and Practice: Volume II, p.140-41. . In music theory, the recapitulation is one of the sections of a movement written in sonata form. The recapitulation occurs after the movement's development section, and typically presents once more the musical themes from the movement's exposition. This material is most often recapitulated in the tonic key of the movement, in such a way that it reaffirms that key as the movement's home key. In some sonata form movements, the recapitulation presents a straightforward image of the movement's exposition. However, many sonata form movements, even early examples, depart from this simple procedure. Devices used by composers include incorporating a secondary development section, or varying the character of the original material, or rearranging its order, or adding new material, or omitting material altogether, or overlaying material that was kept separate in the exposition.

Club career =Hibernian= 'Zibi' first appeared for Hibernian as a trialist in a 5‚Äì0 win over St Patrick's Athletic in the 2005‚Äì06 pre-season tour of Ireland. He then made a second showing in the game 24 hours later against Shamrock Rovers. He impressed Tony Mowbray, and on returning to Edinburgh was signed on a two-year contract. After initially impressing during the first half of the 2005‚Äì06 league season, he started to make errors around the turn of the year. Ma≈Çkowski was notable for making a series of errors in derby matches against Hibs' rivals, Hearts. His first two mistakes in the 2006 Scottish Cup defeat, followed by an error leading to a Hearts equaliser in the next derby, which Hibs won 2‚Äì1. Having kept his place under Tony Mowbray during the following season, he made two bad errors in the first derby after Mowbray's departure to West Brom. Ma≈Çkowski's errors resulted in a draw, in a game where they had been 2‚Äì0 up after sixteen minutes. In what proved to be Malkowski's last game for the club, he made a serious error in the next derby match, when he dropped a tame free kick by Paul Hartley into the path of Edgaras Jankauskas, who scored into the unguarded net. This led to Ma≈Çkowski being dropped from the Hibernian squad entirely for the following match against Dunfermline, being replaced by Andrew McNeil. Gretna Having completely fallen out of favour at Hibs, Ma≈Çkowski was loaned out to Scottish First Division leaders Gretna towards the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. He replaced Alan Main, who had signed a pre-contract agreement with their promotion rivals St Johnstone. Ma≈Çkowski made a positive impression at Gretna, keeping several clean sheets, including a penalty save against Dundee that preserved a 1‚Äì0 win. Ma≈Çkowski's performances contributed towards Gretna's promotion to the Scottish Premier League. Inverness Ma≈Çkowski returned to Hibs after completing his loan spell at Gretna. He was still completely out of favour at Hibs, who had signed Yves Makabu-Makalambay to be their first choice goalkeeper. Ma≈Çkowski played as a trialist in a match for Falkirk, who subsequently signed Tim Krul on loan from Newcastle. On 31 August 2007, he joined Inverness on a season-long loan. Ma≈Çkowski made an error in his first match for Inverness against Aberdeen, which they lost 2‚Äì1. =Poland= After completing loan spells at Gretna and Inverness, Ma≈Çkowski was released by Hibernian on 1 September 2008.

The first French edition was published posthumously in 1796, but it was known earlier in Germany, thanks to Schiller's partial translation, which appeared in 1785 and was retranslated into French in 1793, as well as Mylius's complete German version of 1792. Plot The main subject of the book is the relationship between the valet Jacques and his master, who is never named. The two are traveling to a destination the narrator leaves vague, and to dispel the boredom of the journey Jacques is compelled by his master to recount the story of his loves. However, Jacques's story is continually interrupted by other characters and various comic mishaps. Other characters in the book tell their own stories and they, too, are continually interrupted. There is even a \\"reader\\" who periodically interrupts the narrator with questions, objections, and demands for more information or detail. The tales told are usually humorous, with romance or sex as their subject matter, and feature complex characters indulging in deception. Jacques's key philosophy is that everything that happens to us down here, whether for good or for evil, has been written up above (\\"tout ce qui nous arrive de bien et de mal ici-bas √©tait √©crit l√†- haut\\"), on a \\"great scroll\\" that is unrolled a little bit at a time. Yet Jacques still places value on his actions and is not a passive character. Critics such as J. Robert Loy have characterized Jacques's philosophy as not fatalism but determinism.Loy, J. Robert (1950). Diderot's Determined Fatalist. New York: King's Crown Press. The book is full of contradictory characters and other dualities. One story tells of two men in the army who are so much alike that, though they are the best of friends, they cannot stop dueling and wounding each other. Another concerns Father Hudson, an intelligent and effective reformer of the church who is privately the most debauched character in the book. Even Jacques and his master transcend their apparent roles, as Jacques proves, in his insolence, that his master cannot live without him, and therefore it is Jacques who is the master and the master who is the servant. The story of Jacques's loves is lifted directly from Tristram Shandy, which Diderot makes no secret of, as the narrator at the end announces the insertion of an entire passage from Tristram Shandy into the story. Throughout the work, the narrator refers derisively to sentimental novels and calls attention to the ways in which events develop more realistically in his book. At other times, the narrator tires of the tedium of narration altogether and obliges the reader to supply certain trivial details. Literary significance and criticism The critical reception of the book has been mixed. French critics of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries dismissed it as derivative of Rabelais and Laurence Sterne, as well as unnecessarily bawdy. It made a better impression on the German Romantics, who had had the opportunity to read it before their French counterparts did (as outlined above). Schiller held it in high regard and recommended it strongly to Goethe, who read Jacques in a single sitting.¬´ Lu de 6 h √† 11 h et demie, et d‚Äôune traite, Jacques le Fataliste de Diderot ; me suis d√©lect√© comme le Baal de Babylone √† un festin aussi √©norme ; ai remerci√© Dieu que je sois capable d‚Äôengloutir ai remerci√© Dieu que je sois capable d'engloutir une telle portion d‚Äôun seul coup. Friedrich Schlegel referred to it positively in his critical fragments (3, 15) and in the Athenaeum fragments (201). It formed something of an ideal of Schlegel's concept of wit. Stendhal, while acknowledging flaws in Jacques, nevertheless considered it a superior and exemplary work. In the twentieth century, critics such as Leo Spitzer and J. Robert Loy tended to see Jacques as a key work in the tradition of Cervantes and Rabelais, focused on celebrating diversity rather than providing clear answers to philosophical problems. Adaptations Jacques le Fataliste is the most commonly adapted of Diderot's works. * Robert Bresson adapted a self-contained anecdote, the story of Madame de La Pommeraye, from Jacques le fataliste for his film Les dames du Bois de Boulogne (1945). The dialogue for the film was written by Jean Cocteau. This episode was also the basis of Fritz Wendhausen's Madame de La Pommeraye's Intrigues (1922). The story was adapted again in Emmanuel Mouret's Mademoiselle de Joncqui√®res (2018). * Milan Kundera dramatised the novel in 1971, under the title Jacques et son ma√Ætre. In his essay The Art of the Novel, Kundera argues that Jacques le Fataliste is one of the masterpieces of the form.

History =Founding and early history= This bank was founded in 1946 by Siegmund Warburg and Henry Grunfeld. Siegmund was a member of the Warburg family, a prominent German-Jewish banking family. Henry Grunfeld was a former industrialist in the German steel industry, and is also Jewish. Warburg and Grunfeld fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s. S. G. Warburg and Co. were recognised for its pioneering mergers and takeover work in the UK in the 1960s. These works included the first ever hostile takeover in the UK and the first-ever Eurobond issue, which fostered the new Eurodollar market. The firm's acquisition of Seligman Bros. in 1957 was a significant event in its rise to prominence; through this, Warburg gained a place on the Accepting Houses Committee, which is composed of the 17 top merchant banks with access to cheap capital backed by the Bank of England.Chernow, p. 646 In 1958‚Äì1959, Tube Investments, advised by S.

The theater was named for its owner and chief funder, John Wesley Pence, a financier originally from Ohio, and was designed by architect Abraham M. Radcliffe. Though sometimes called the first theater in Minneapolis, it was actually built eight years after the first known theater in the city, Harrison's Hall. During construction, the building was struck by lightning, which was called \\"an act of God's retribution\\" by a local minister in his Sunday sermon that week. Soon afterwards, the minister's church was also struck by lightning. The Opera House was opened in 1867 with a seating capacity of 700. The three-story building housed shops on its first floor, offices on its second, a billiard parlor in the basement, and the theater on the third. In 1879, the theater was remodeled and increased its capacity to 900. Along with the St. Paul Opera House, it was one of the first music venues in the Twin Cities, joined in 1872 by the larger Academy of Music. The theater opened on June 21, 1867 with a performance of Sheridan Knowles' play The Hunchback, attended by Governor William Marshall and Sen. Alexander Ramsey. Performances at the Pence included musicians such as Norwegian violinist Ole Bull, vaudeville and minstrel shows, and plays such as The Rivals, Our American Cousin, and Shakespearian works including Richard III. In its early years, the theater was one of the city's major gathering places, but was overshadowed by the opening of the Academy of Music and struggled thereafter. In the 1890s and early 1900s, the theater was empty and unused, and the building grew dilapidated. It became a rooming house in the early 1900s, then a mission in 1915. The building was razed in 1952. Before the construction of the original Minneapolis City Hall in 1873, city government officials worked out of rented space in the Pence Opera House building.

History The company was founded by director Max Lincoln, whose first film was DreamBoy (2002). In 2004, the company set up a joint venture with Netherlands-based distributor Eurocreme BV, which used the \\"Eurocreme Sales\\" brand to market a portfolio of mostly bareback-sex movies from AVI Production, Prague, released under various brand names. In late 2008, both companies split their affairs but still are partnered in a United States- based distribution joint venture, Euro Media Distributors. In 2009, Eurocreme partnered with Alphamalemedia.com, a UK-based muscle studio owned by porn star Trojan Rock. This partnership enabled the company to offer a large portfolio of product to appeal to a wide audience. In April 2010, Eurocreme announced that it had signed a boy band named Boy Banned. This announcement sparked widespread speculation that Eurocreme was adopting a diversification strategy. Production Best known for the films directed by Lincoln, Simon Booth, Marc Reardon and Maxwell B, Eurocreme produces eleven separate brands. Of these, the flagship remains the \\"Boy\\" series, most recently \\"CountryBoy\\" and \\"DirtyBoy\\". Eurocreme's other brands include the series Rudeboiz, which shows more intense gay sex between rough British young men, known as chavs. Eurocreme has also released a number of titles under the \\"Indieboyz\\" label, devoted to sex between young men styled in the indie-pop fashion popular in the UK. Performers in the \\"Hung Ladz\\" brand have larger-than-average penises. The company has branched into mainstream film making with the release of VGL - Hung!, directed by Maxwell B.

It includes the systematic use of digital resources in the humanities, as well as the analysis of their application. DH can be defined as new ways of doing scholarship that involve collaborative, transdisciplinary, and computationally engaged research, teaching, and publishing. It brings digital tools and methods to the study of the humanities with the recognition that the printed word is no longer the main medium for knowledge production and distribution. By producing and using new applications and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching and research possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. Thus, a distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way relationship between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects technology to humanistic questioning and interrogation, often simultaneously. Definition The definition of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the field is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future potential. The second volume of Debates in the Digital Humanities (2016) acknowledges the difficulty in defining the field: \\"Along with the digital archives, quantitative analyses, and tool- building projects that once characterized the field, DH now encompasses a wide range of methods and practices: visualizations of large image sets, 3D modeling of historical artifacts, 'born digital' dissertations, hashtag activism and the analysis thereof, alternate reality games, mobile makerspaces, and more. In what has been called 'big tent' DH, it can at times be difficult to determine with any specificity what, precisely, digital humanities work entails.\\" Historically, the digital humanities developed out of humanities computing and has become associated with other fields, such as humanistic computing, social computing, and media studies. In concrete terms, the digital humanities embraces a variety of topics, from curating online collections of primary sources (primarily textual) to the data mining of large cultural data sets to topic modeling. Digital humanities incorporates both digitized (remediated) and born-digital materials and combines the methodologies from traditional humanities disciplines (such as rhetoric, history, philosophy, linguistics, literature, art, archaeology, music, and cultural studies) and social sciences, with tools provided by computing (such as hypertext, hypermedia, data visualisation, information retrieval, data mining, statistics, text mining, digital mapping), and digital publishing. Related subfields of digital humanities have emerged like software studies, platform studies, and critical code studies. Fields that parallel the digital humanities include new media studies and information science as well as media theory of composition, game studies, particularly in areas related to digital humanities project design and production, and cultural analytics. The Digital Humanities Stack (from Berry and Fagerjord, Digital Humanities: Knowledge and Critique in a Digital Age) Berry and Fagerjord have suggested that a way to reconceptualise digital humanities could be through a \\"digital humanities stack\\". They argue that \\"this type of diagram is common in computation and computer science to show how technologies are 'stacked' on top of each other in increasing levels of abstraction. Here, [they] use the method in a more illustrative and creative sense of showing the range of activities, practices, skills, technologies and structures that could be said to make up the digital humanities, with the aim of providing a high-level map.\\" Indeed, the \\"diagram can be read as the bottom levels indicating some of the fundamental elements of the digital humanities stack, such as computational thinking and knowledge representation, and then other elements that later build on these. \\" In practical terms, a major distinction within digital humanities is the focus on the data being processed. For processing textual data, digital humanities builds on a long and extensive history of digital edition, computational linguistics and natural language processing and developed an independent and highly specialized technology stack (largely cumulating in the specifications of the Text Encoding Initiative). This part of the field is sometimes thus set apart from Digital Humanities in general as \`digital philology' or \`computational philology'. For the analysis and digital edition of objects or artifacts, different technologies are required. History Digital humanities descends from the field of humanities computing, whose origins reach back to 1940s and 50s, in the pioneering work of Jesuit scholar Roberto Busa, which began in 1946, and of English professor Josephine Miles, beginning in the early 1950s. In collaboration with IBM, Busa and his team created a computer- generated concordance to Thomas Aquinas' writings known as the Index Thomisticus. Other scholars began using mainframe computers to automate tasks like word-searching, sorting, and counting, which was much faster than processing information from texts with handwritten or typed index cards. In the decades which followed archaeologists, classicists, historians, literary scholars, and a broad array of humanities researchers in other disciplines applied emerging computational methods to transform humanities scholarship. As Tara McPherson has pointed out, the digital humanities also inherit practices and perspectives developed through many artistic and theoretical engagements with electronic screen culture beginning the late 1960s and 1970s. These range from research developed by organizations such as SIGGRAPH to creations by artists such as Charles and Ray Eames and the members of E.A.T. (Experiments in Art and Technology). The Eames and E.A.T. explored nascent computer culture and intermediality in creative works that dovetailed technological innovation with art.McPherson, Tara. \\"DH by Design: Feminism, aesthetics + the digital.\\" Congress of the Social Science and Humanities. University of Calgary, 2016-05-31. Keynote. The first specialized journal in the digital humanities was Computers and the Humanities, which debuted in 1966. The Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology (CAA) association was founded in 1973. The Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing (ALLC) and the Association for Computers and the Humanities (ACH) were then founded in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Soon, there was a need for a standardized protocol for tagging digital texts, and the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) was developed. The TEI project was launched in 1987 and published the first full version of the TEI Guidelines in May 1994. TEI helped shape the field of electronic textual scholarship and led to Extensible Markup Language (XML), which is a tag scheme for digital editing. Researchers also began experimenting with databases and hypertextual editing, which are structured around links and nodes, as opposed to the standard linear convention of print. In the nineties, major digital text and image archives emerged at centers of humanities computing in the U.S. (e.g. the Women Writers Project, the Rossetti Archive, and The William Blake Archive), which demonstrated the sophistication and robustness of text-encoding for literature. The advent of personal computing and the World Wide Web meant that Digital Humanities work could become less centered on text and more on design. The multimedia nature of the internet has allowed Digital Humanities work to incorporate audio, video, and other components in addition to text. The terminological change from \\"humanities computing\\" to \\"digital humanities\\" has been attributed to John Unsworth, Susan Schreibman, and Ray Siemens who, as editors of the anthology A Companion to Digital Humanities (2004), tried to prevent the field from being viewed as \\"mere digitization.\\" Consequently, the hybrid term has created an overlap between fields like rhetoric and composition, which use \\"the methods of contemporary humanities in studying digital objects,\\" and digital humanities, which uses \\"digital technology in studying traditional humanities objects\\". The use of computational systems and the study of computational media within the humanities, arts and social sciences more generally has been termed the 'computational turn'. In 2006 the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) launched the Digital Humanities Initiative (renamed Office of Digital Humanities in 2008), which made widespread adoption of the term \\"digital humanities\\" all but irreversible in the United States. Digital humanities emerged from its former niche status and became \\"big news\\" at the 2009 MLA convention in Philadelphia, where digital humanists made \\"some of the liveliest and most visible contributions\\" and had their field hailed as \\"the first 'next big thing' in a long time.\\"  Values and methods  Although digital humanities projects and initiatives are diverse, they often reflect common values and methods. These can help in understanding this hard-to-define field. Values * Critical and theoretical * Iterative and experimental * Collaborative and distributed * Multimodal and performative * Open and accessible Methods * Enhanced critical curation * Augmented editions and fluid textuality * Scale: the law of large numbers * Distant/close, macro/micro, surface/depth * Cultural analytics, aggregation, and data-mining * Visualization and data design * Locative investigation and thick mapping * The animated archive * Distributed knowledge production and performative access * Humanities gaming * Code, software, and platform studies * Database documentaries * Repurposable content and remix culture * Pervasive infrastructure * Ubiquitous scholarship In keeping with the value of being open and accessible, many digital humanities projects and journals are open access and/or under Creative Commons licensing, showing the field's \\"commitment to open standards and open source.\\" Open access is designed to enable anyone with an internet-enabled device and internet connection to view a website or read an article without having to pay, as well as share content with the appropriate permissions. Digital humanities scholars use computational methods either to answer existing research questions or to challenge existing theoretical paradigms, generating new questions and pioneering new approaches. One goal is to systematically integrate computer technology into the activities of humanities scholars, as is done in contemporary empirical social sciences. Yet despite the significant trend in digital humanities towards networked and multimodal forms of knowledge, a substantial amount of digital humanities focuses on documents and text in ways that differentiate the field's work from digital research in media studies, information studies, communication studies, and sociology. Another goal of digital humanities is to create scholarship that transcends textual sources. This includes the integration of multimedia, metadata, and dynamic environments (see The Valley of the Shadow project at the University of Virginia, the Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular at University of Southern California, or Digital Pioneers projects at Harvard). A growing number of researchers in digital humanities are using computational methods for the analysis of large cultural data sets such as the Google Books corpus.Roth, S. (2014), \\"Fashionable functions. A Google n-gram view of trends in functional differentiation (1800-2000)\\", International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction, Band 10, Nr. 2, S. 34-58 (online: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2491422). Examples of such projects were highlighted by the Humanities High Performance Computing competition sponsored by the Office of Digital Humanities in 2008, and also by the Digging Into Data challenge organized in 2009 and 2011 by NEH in collaboration with NSF, and in partnership with JISC in the UK, and SSHRC in Canada. In addition to books, historical newspapers can also be analyzed with big data methods. The analysis of vast quantities of historical newspaper content has showed how periodic structures can be automatically discovered, and a similar analysis was performed on social media.Seasonal Fluctuations in Collective Mood Revealed by Wikipedia Searches and Twitter Posts, F Dzogang, T Lansdall-Welfare, N Cristianini ‚Äì 2016 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, Workshop on Data Mining in Human Activity Analysis As part of the big data revolution, gender bias, readability, content similarity, reader preferences, and even mood have been analyzed based on text mining methods over millions of documentsNOAM: news outlets analysis and monitoring system; I Flaounas, O Ali, M Turchi, T Snowsill, F Nicart, T De Bie, N Cristianini Proc. of the 2011 ACM SIGMOD international conference on Management of dataAutomatic discovery of patterns in media content, N Cristianini, Combinatorial Pattern Matching, 2-13, 2011 and historical documents written in literary Chinese.Bol, P.

Environments for \\"creating, publishing and working with digital scholarship include everything from personal equipment to institutes and software to cyberspace.\\"Gardiner, Eileen and Ronald G. Musto. (2015). The Digital Humanities: A Primer for Students and Scholars. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 83. Some scholars use advanced programming languages and databases, while others use less complex tools, depending on their needs. DiRT (Digital Research Tools Directory) offers a registry of digital research tools for scholars. TAPoR (Text Analysis Portal for Research) is a gateway to text analysis and retrieval tools. An accessible, free example of an online textual analysis program is Voyant Tools, which only requires the user to copy and paste either a body of text or a URL and then click the 'reveal' button to run the program. There is also an online list of online or downloadable Digital Humanities tools that are largely free, aimed toward helping students and others who lack access to funding or institutional servers. Free, open source web publishing platforms like WordPress and Omeka are also popular tools.  Projects  Digital humanities projects are more likely than traditional humanities work to involve a team or a lab, which may be composed of faculty, staff, graduate or undergraduate students, information technology specialists, and partners in galleries, libraries, archives, and museums. Credit and authorship are often given to multiple people to reflect this collaborative nature, which is different from the sole authorship model in the traditional humanities (and more like the natural sciences). There are thousands of digital humanities projects, ranging from small-scale ones with limited or no funding to large- scale ones with multi-year financial support. Some are continually updated while others may not be due to loss of support or interest, though they may still remain online in either a beta version or a finished form. The following are a few examples of the variety of projects in the field:See CUNY Academic Commons Wiki Archive for more. =Digital archives= The Women Writers Project (begun in 1988) is a long-term research project to make pre-Victorian women writers more accessible through an electronic collection of rare texts. The Walt Whitman Archive (begun in the 1990s) sought to create a hypertext and scholarly edition of Whitman's works and now includes photographs, sounds, and the only comprehensive current bibliography of Whitman criticism. The Emily Dickinson Archive (begun in 2013). See Emily Dickinson Archive website is a collection of high-resolution images of Dickinson's poetry manuscripts as well as a searchable lexicon of over 9,000 words that appear in the poems. network analysis as an archival tool at the League of Nations.League of Nations archives, United Nations Office in Geneva. Network visualization and analysis published in The Slave Societies Digital Archive (formerly Ecclesiastical and Secular Sources for Slave Societies), directed by Jane Landers and hosted at Vanderbilt University, preserves endangered ecclesiastical and secular documents related to Africans and African-descended peoples in slave societies. This Digital Archive currently holds 500,000 unique images, dating from the 16th to the 20th centuries, and documents the history of between 6 and 8 million individuals. They are the most extensive serial records for the history of Africans in the Atlantic World and also include valuable information on the indigenous, European, and Asian populations who lived alongside them. The involvement of librarians and archivists plays an important part in digital humanities projects because of the recent expansion of their role so that it now covers digital curation, which is critical in the preservation, promotion, and access to digital collections, as well as the application of scholarly orientation to digital humanities projects. A specific example involves the case of initiatives where archivists help scholars and academics build their projects through their experience in evaluating, implementing, and customizing metadata schemas for library collections. The initiatives at the National Autonomous University of Mexico is another example of a digital humanities project. These include the digitization of 17th-century manuscripts, an electronic corpus of Mexican history from the 16th to 19th century, and the visualization of pre-Hispanic archaeological sites in 3-D. =Cultural analytics= \\"Cultural analytics\\" refers to the use of computational method for exploration and analysis of large visual collections and also contemporary digital media. The concept was developed in 2005 by Lev Manovich who then established the Cultural Analytics Lab in 2007 at Qualcomm Institute at California Institute for Telecommunication and Information (Calit2). The lab has been using methods from the field of computer science called Computer Vision many types of both historical and contemporary visual media‚Äîfor example, all covers of Time magazine published between 1923 and 2009, 20,000 historical art photographs from the collection in Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York, one million pages from Manga books, and 16 million images shared on Instagram in 17 global cities. Cultural analytics also includes using methods from media design and data visualization to create interactive visual interfaces for exploration of large visual collections e.g., Selfiecity and On Broadway. Cultural analytics research is also addressing a number of theoretical questions. How can we \\"observe\\" giant cultural universes of both user-generated and professional media content created today, without reducing them to averages, outliers, or pre-existing categories? How can work with large cultural data help us question our stereotypes and assumptions about cultures? What new theoretical cultural concepts and models are required for studying global digital culture with its new mega-scale, speed, and connectivity? The term \\"cultural analytics\\" (or \\"culture analytics\\") is now used by many other researchers, as exemplified by two academic symposiums,\\"Cultural Analytics: Computational Approaches to the Study of Culture\\", the University of Chicago, May 2015 and \\"Cultural Analytics symposium\\", Notre Dame University, May 2017. a four-month long research program at UCLA that brought together 120 leading researchers from university and industry labs,\\"Culture Analytics program\\", Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM), UCLA, March 7‚ÄìJune 10, 2016. an academic peer-review Journal of Cultural Analytics: CA established in 2016, and academic job listings. =Textual mining, analysis, and visualization= WordHoard (begun in 2004) is a free application that enables scholarly but non-technical users to read and analyze, in new ways, deeply-tagged texts, including the canon of Early Greek epic, Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Spenser. The Republic of Letters (begun in 2008) seeks to visualize the social network of Enlightenment writers through an interactive map and visualization tools. Network analysis and data visualization is also used for reflections on the field itself ‚Äì researchers may produce network maps of social media interactions or infographics from data on digital humanities scholars and projects.Network analysis: graph of Digital Humanities Twitter users. =Analysis of macroscopic trends in cultural change= Culturomics is a form of computational lexicology that studies human behavior and cultural trends through the quantitative analysis of digitized texts. Researchers data mine large digital archives to investigate cultural phenomena reflected in language and word usage. The term is an American neologism first described in a 2010 Science article called Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books, co-authored by Harvard researchers Jean-Baptiste Michel and Erez Lieberman Aiden. A 2017 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America compared the trajectory of n-grams over time in both digitised books from the 2010 Science article with those found in a large corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom over the course of 150 years. The study further went on to use more advanced Natural language processing techniques to discover macroscopic trends in history and culture, including gender bias, geographical focus, technology, and politics, along with accurate dates for specific events. =Online publishing= The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (begun in 1995) is a dynamic reference work of terms, concepts, and people from philosophy maintained by scholars in the field. MLA Commons offers an open peer-review site (where anyone can comment) for their ongoing curated collection of teaching artifacts in Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments (2016). The Debates in the Digital Humanities platform contains volumes of the open-access book of the same title (2012 and 2016 editions) and allows readers to interact with material by marking sentences as interesting or adding terms to a crowdsourced index. = Wikimedia projects = Some research institutions work with the Wikimedia Foundation or volunteers of the community, for example, to make freely licensed media files available via Wikimedia Commons or to link or load data sets with Wikidata. Text analysis has been performed on the contribution history of articles on Wikipedia or its sister projects. Criticism In 2012, Matthew K. Gold identified a range of perceived criticisms of the field of digital humanities: \\"'a lack of attention to issues of race, class, gender, and sexuality; a preference for research-driven projects over pedagogical ones; an absence of political commitment; an inadequate level of diversity among its practitioners; an inability to address texts under copyright; and an institutional concentration in well-funded research universities\\". Similarly Berry and Fagerjord have argued that a digital humanities should \\"focus on the need to think critically about the implications of computational imaginaries, and raise some questions in this regard. This is also to foreground the importance of the politics and norms that are embedded in digital technology, algorithms and software. We need to explore how to negotiate between close and distant readings of texts and how micro-analysis and macro-analysis can be usefully reconciled in humanist work.\\" Alan Liu has argued, \\"while digital humanists develop tools, data, and metadata critically, therefore (e.g., debating the 'ordered hierarchy of content objects' principle; disputing whether computation is best used for truth finding or, as Lisa Samuels and Jerome McGann put it, 'deformance'; and so on) rarely do they extend their critique to the full register of society, economics, politics, or culture.\\" Some of these concerns have given rise to the emergent subfield of Critical Digital Humanities (CDH): > \\"Some key questions include: how do we make the invisible become visible in > the study of software? How is knowledge transformed when mediated through > code and software? What are the critical approaches to Big Data, > visualization, digital methods, etc.? How does computation create new > disciplinary boundaries and gate-keeping functions? What are the new > hegemonic representations of the digital ‚Äì 'geons', 'pixels', 'waves', > visualization, visual rhetorics, etc.? How do media changes create epistemic > changes, and how can we look behind the 'screen essentialism' of > computational interfaces? Here we might also reflect on the way in which the > practice of making-visible also entails the making-invisible ‚Äì computation > involves making choices about what is to be captured. \\" =Negative publicity= Lauren F. Klein and Gold note that many appearances of the digital humanities in public media are often in a critical fashion. Armand Leroi, writing in The New York Times, discusses the contrast between the algorithmic analysis of themes in literary texts and the work of Harold Bloom, who qualitatively and phenomenologically analyzes the themes of literature over time. Leroi questions whether or not the digital humanities can provide a truly robust analysis of literature and social phenomenon or offer a novel alternative perspective on them. The literary theorist Stanley Fish claims that the digital humanities pursue a revolutionary agenda and thereby undermine the conventional standards of \\"pre-eminence, authority and disciplinary power.\\" However, digital humanities scholars note that \\"Digital Humanities is an extension of traditional knowledge skills and methods, not a replacement for them. Its distinctive contributions do not obliterate the insights of the past, but add and supplement the humanities' long-standing commitment to scholarly interpretation, informed research, structured argument, and dialogue within communities of practice\\". Some have hailed the digital humanities as a solution to the apparent problems within the humanities, namely a decline in funding, a repeat of debates, and a fading set of theoretical claims and methodological arguments. Adam Kirsch, writing in the New Republic, calls this the \\"False Promise\\" of the digital humanities. While the rest of humanities and many social science departments are seeing a decline in funding or prestige, the digital humanities has been seeing increasing funding and prestige. Burdened with the problems of novelty, the digital humanities is discussed as either a revolutionary alternative to the humanities as it is usually conceived or as simply new wine in old bottles. Kirsch believes that digital humanities practitioners suffer from problems of being marketers rather than scholars, who attest to the grand capacity of their research more than actually performing new analysis and when they do so, only performing trivial parlor tricks of research. This form of criticism has been repeated by others, such as in Carl Staumshein, writing in Inside Higher Education, who calls it a \\"Digital Humanities Bubble\\". Later in the same publication, Straumshein alleges that the digital humanities is a 'Corporatist Restructuring' of the Humanities. Some see the alliance of the digital humanities with business to be a positive turn that causes the business world to pay more attention, thus bringing needed funding and attention to the humanities. If it were not burdened by the title of digital humanities, it could escape the allegations that it is elitist and unfairly funded. =Black box= There has also been critique of the use of digital humanities tools by scholars who do not fully understand what happens to the data they input and place too much trust in the \\"black box\\" of software that cannot be sufficiently examined for errors. Johanna Drucker, a professor at UCLA Department of Information Studies, has criticized the \\"epistemological fallacies\\" prevalent in popular visualization tools and technologies (such as Google's n-gram graph) used by digital humanities scholars and the general public, calling some network diagramming and topic modeling tools \\"just too crude for humanistic work.\\" The lack of transparency in these programs obscures the subjective nature of the data and its processing, she argues, as these programs \\"generate standard diagrams based on conventional algorithms for screen display...mak[ing] it very difficult for the semantics of the data processing to be made evident.\\" =Diversity= There has also been some recent controversy among practitioners of digital humanities around the role that race and/or identity politics plays. Tara McPherson attributes some of the lack of racial diversity in digital humanities to the modality of UNIX and computers themselves. An open thread on DHpoco.org recently garnered well over 100 comments on the issue of race in digital humanities, with scholars arguing about the amount that racial (and other) biases affect the tools and texts available for digital humanities research. McPherson posits that there needs to be an understanding and theorizing of the implications of digital technology and race, even when the subject for analysis appears not to be about race. Amy E. Earhart criticizes what has become the new digital humanities \\"canon\\" in the shift from websites using simple HTML to the usage of the TEI and visuals in textual recovery projects. Works that has been previously lost or excluded were afforded a new home on the internet, but much of the same marginalizing practices found in traditional humanities also took place digitally. According to Earhart, there is a \\"need to examine the canon that we, as digital humanists, are constructing, a canon that skews toward traditional texts and excludes crucial work by women, people of color, and the LGBTQ community.\\" =Issues of access= Practitioners in digital humanities are also failing to meet the needs of users with disabilities. George H. Williams argues that universal design is imperative for practitioners to increase usability because \\"many of the otherwise most valuable digital resources are useless for people who are‚Äîfor example‚Äîdeaf or hard of hearing, as well as for people who are blind, have low vision, or have difficulty distinguishing particular colors.\\" In order to provide accessibility successfully, and productive universal design, it is important to understand why and how users with disabilities are using the digital resources while remembering that all users approach their informational needs differently. =Cultural criticism= Digital humanities have been criticized for not only ignoring traditional questions of lineage and history in the humanities, but lacking the fundamental cultural criticism that defines the humanities. However, it remains to be seen whether or not the humanities have to be tied to cultural criticism, per se, in order to be the humanities. The sciences might imagine the Digital Humanities as a welcome improvement over the non- quantitative methods of the humanities and social sciences. =Difficulty of evaluation= As the field matures, there has been a recognition that the standard model of academic peer-review of work may not be adequate for digital humanities projects, which often involve website components, databases, and other non-print objects. Evaluation of quality and impact thus require a combination of old and new methods of peer review. One response has been the creation of the DHCommons Journal. This accepts non-traditional submissions, especially mid-stage digital projects, and provides an innovative model of peer review more suited for the multimedia, transdisciplinary, and milestone- driven nature of Digital Humanities projects. Other professional humanities organizations, such as the American Historical Association and the Modern Language Association, have developed guidelines for evaluating academic digital scholarship. =Lack of focus on pedagogy= The 2012 edition of Debates in the Digital Humanities recognized the fact that pedagogy was the \\"neglected 'stepchild' of DH\\" and included an entire section on teaching the digital humanities. Part of the reason is that grants in the humanities are geared more toward research with quantifiable results rather than teaching innovations, which are harder to measure.

It is located in the Valley of the Araguaia River, 300 kilometers from the state capital, Goi√¢nia, and is served by highways GO-164 and GO-334. The distance to Goi√¢nia is 313 km. Highway connections are made by GO-070 / Goianira / Inhumas / Itabera√≠ / BR-070 / Goi√°s / GO-164 / Araguapaz / GO-347. It forms its northern boundary with the municipality of Nova Crix√°s; its western boundary with Aruan√£; its southern boundary with Araguapaz; and its eastern boundary with Crix√°s. The main rivers that bathe the municipality are the Rio Tesouras and Rio do Peixe, besides the streams (c√≥rregos) of Alagadinho, Alagado, S√£o Jo√£o, Fogueira, Barreirinho, do Gato, Lagoinha, do Buriti, do Manoel and Muqu√©m. Because of the flat topography near the main rivers, there are places that have a rich formation in lakes: Landi, Lolito, Pedra, Correia, da On√ßa, da M√£e, Redondo, Caba√ßa and many others. The mountains that stand out are Constantino, Pimenta, Pouso Alto, Jiripoca, Tombador and Bananal and the hills of S√£o Jo√£o and Engano. The European history of this town began in 1952 when the surveyors Pedro Leite da Silva, Mozart de Andrade Mota, and Edgar de Alencar Mota set up camp near the confluence of the Barreirinho and Fogueira rivers, to survey the land for an agricultural colony called \\"Barreirinho e S√£o Jo√£o\\". Mota bought land and created lots to build a settlement. In 1954 the first hut was built and soon other settlers arrived form the state of Minas Gerais. The first name was \\"Barreirinho\\". In 1956 working together the settlers opened a road to Nova Am√©rica so they could get their agricultural products to market. In 1958 Barreirinho became a district in the municipality of Goi√°s, the name changing to Mozarl√¢ndia, in homage to Mozart Andrade Mota who had distributed land to settlers and ranchers who wanted to stay in the area. Mota was mayor for two terms and in his administrations he carried out important works, like the building of the city hall, the public jail, and two plazas. He donated land to schools, churches, the city hall, the aerodrome, and the cemetery. He brought electricity and built the first schools. He died in 1993 remembered by his fellow citizens in the name of the town where he lived. In January 2005 the Mayor was Jo√£o Soares de Oliveira and the Vice- mayor was Mailton de Oliveira Souza. The city council had 9 members and there were 10,258 eligible voters in 2007. In 2007 the population density was 7.57 inhabitants/km2. In 2007 the urban population was 10,832 and the rural population was 2,291. The population has increased by more than 3,000 people since 1980. From 1996 to 2007 the geometric population increase was 2.33.%. With an economy based on cattle raising, Mozarl√¢ndia has one of the largest packing houses in the country. The biggest exporter of meat from Brazil and the second in Latin America, the Frigor√≠fico Bertin, installed two years ago in the town, has the capacity to slaughter 1,500 head per day. The meat is exported to Egypt, United States, Chile, and Iran. Flour, meat, bone, and blood are all processed. The leather is sent in a natural state to a tanner in S√£o Lu√≠s de Montes Belos. In 2007 there were 10 industrial units and 152 retail units in the city. The banking sector was represented by three banks. In 2007 there were 952 automobiles. The sector employing more workers was the transformation industry with 1,222 workers, followed by commerce with 344 workers (IBGE data from 2005). *Farms: 332 *Total agricultural Area: 414,016 hectares *Permanent Planted Area: 192 hectares *Temporary Planted Area: 47,268 hectares *Natural Pasture: 266,565 hectares *Woodland and Forest: 93,960 hectares *Workers related to the farm owner: 533 *Workers not related to the farm owner: 333 (IBGE) *Cattle herd: 176,580 head (2006) *Main crops: rice (60 hectares), rubber (81 hectares), and corn (300 hectares).

In 2004 alongside Gaucho teammate Drew McAthy, Jones appeared in 9 games and scored 3 goals. After leaving Santa Barbara, Jones went on trial with European clubs, including Atl√©tico Madrid and Aalesunds FK, in hopes of securing a professional contract. While with Aalesunds FK, the training staff were impressed with his play and wanted Jones to play in front of manager Ivar Morten Normark, who had been out on holiday. He appeared in a friendly match for Aalesunds against IL H√∏dd, but he was forced to leave just minutes from the start after fracturing his leg, ending his trial with the club. After rehabbing from his injury, Jones spent time with East Coast Bays AFC. He later signed a short-term contract with Queensland Roar FC of the A-League. Jones was unable to find his way on to the opening day roster and never competed in a league game for Queensland.

Birth and family Ames was born in Amesville, Athens County, Ohio, one of three Methodist Episcopal Bishops to be born in Athens County. Education and ministry At age 20, Ames became a student at Ohio University at Athens. During his student years he united with the M.E. Church (August 1827). In 1828 he opened a high school in Lebanon, Illinois which later became McKendree University. He taught there until 1830, when he became a pastor in the Illinois Annual Conference. He was licensed to preach by the circuit rider (and presiding elder), Peter Cartwright. Upon the organization of the Indiana Conference in 1832, Ames joined that body, serving the majority of his active pastoral life in the State of Indiana (with the exception of two years spent in St. Louis), until becoming a bishop. Ames was elected a delegate to the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church held in Baltimore in 1840, and was there elected Corresponding Secretary of the M.E. Missionary Society, with responsibilities for the South and West. When the Church South broke with the Church North over slavery, he remained with the M.E. Church. The Rev. Ames was subsequently elected Delegate to General Conferences in 1844 and 1852. Native American work Ames traveled extensively, especially visiting the Indian Missions of his denomination along the northern lakes and on the western frontier. He aided in establishing missions schools among the various tribes west of Arkansas. In 1848 he officiated as chaplain to a Council of Choctaws, being the first chaplain chosen by an Indian Assembly. Ames was elected president of Indiana Asbury University in 1848, as well. But he declined the position, preferring to remain in more active ministerial work. Episcopal ministry Ames was elected to the episcopacy of the Methodist Episcopal Church by the 1852 General Conference. He thereafter traveled extensively through all the U.S. States and Territories. His first visit to the Pacific coast was 1852-53. Ames was a firm supporter of the Union during the American Civil War. Though offered positions of influence, he declined them that he might be free for ecclesiastical duties. For example, when the United States government seized the property of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South (in Southern United States), Ames was put in charge of the confiscated property by President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. Such confiscation resulted in complaints of unconstitutional governmental involvement in religion. Death and burial Ames' health was impaired for several years, but he continued his work until a few weeks before his death. He died in Baltimore, Maryland. He is buried in Greenmount Cemetery in that city. See also *List of Bishops of the United Methodist Church References *Cyclopaedia of Methodism, Matthew Simpson, D.D., LL.D., Ed., (Revised Edition.)

He was born in Laon and in the 1650s settled in Paris, quickly establishing himself as one of the best organists of the country. He lived and worked in Paris until his death, but frequently made trips to other cities to consult on organ building and maintenance matters. Leb√®gue's reputation today rests on his keyboard music. He made particularly important contributions to the development of the French organ school by devising pieces with independent pedal parts and developing the Tierce en taille genre. His oeuvre also includes the earliest published unmeasured preludes, as well as some of the earliest known no√´ls. Life Church of Saint-Merri, where Leb√®gue worked from 1664 until his death. Leb√®gue was born in Laon, and nothing certain is known about his early years or training. It may be possible that his uncle (also named Nicolas Leb√®gue), a ma√Ætre joueur d'instrument, played some role in Leb√®gue's music education. Equally little is known about the circumstances of Leb√®gue's move to Paris: the first reference to Leb√®gue is found in a 1661 document, in which the composer is already described as \\"the famous Parisian organist\\", so by then he must have lived and worked in the city long enough to secure a solid reputation. Although this must mean he held at least one organist's position in Paris, where he worked is unknown. The only post he is known to have held is at the Church of Saint- Merri, where he worked since from 18 December 1664 until his death. Leb√®gue started publishing his music in 1676, and in 1678 was selected to become one of the organistes du Roi (\\"organist to the King\\"), a prestigious position he shared with Guillaume-Gabriel Nivers, Jacques-Denis Thomelin, and Jean- Baptiste Buterne.Higginbottom, Grove. The surviving copies of Leb√®gue's music are very numerous, and this indicates that he was a very highly acclaimed musician. He was equally famous as an expert on organ building: in this capacity, Leb√®gue travelled as far as Bourges, Blois, Chartres, Soissons, and Troyes. Finally, Leb√®gue was also an influential teacher: his pupils include Fran√ßois d'Agincourt, Nicolas de Grigny, and probably many lesser figures such as Gabriel Garnier, Jean-Nicolas Geoffroy, and Gilles Jullien. It was also through Leb√®gue that Pierre Dumage received his first important position, at the Saint-Quentin collegiate church.Apel 1972, 744. Works Title page of Troisieme livre d'orgue Les pi√®ces de clavessin, 1676 (complete score) Leb√®gue's historical importance lies in his keyboard music, of which he published five collections (all published in Paris): *Les pi√®ces d'orgue (1676): 8 organ suites in the eight Church Modes *Les pi√®ces de clavessin (1676): harpsichord suites *2e livre d'orgue (1678): a mass and Magnificat settings for organ *3e livre d'orgue (1685): ten offertories, four symphonies, nine no√´ls, eight √©l√©vations and a program piece, Les cloches *Second livre de clavessin (1687): harpsichord suites A few more pieces for harpsichord and some 20 works for organ survive in manuscript copies. Leb√®gue's harpsichord music continues the tradition established by Jacques Champion de Chambonni√®res and Louis Couperin. In the unmeasured preludes of the first book (the earliest published compositions of this kind) he uses a modified version of Couperin's abstract notation: the modifications, as Leb√®gue writes in the preface, aim \\"to present the preludes as simply as possible\\", and the pieces themselves are much shorter and simpler than Couperin's. To this end, he used mixed note values, as opposed to Couperin's whole notes throughout. No composers adopted Leb√®gue's notation, however, and his second collection of harpsichord music did not include unmeasured preludes. Another important aspect of Leb√®gue's harpsichord style is the tendency towards standardization: many of the suites begin with an allemande-courante pair, in still others it is followed by a sarabande, and then a gigue. Leb√®gue was also more formal than his predecessors in naming his compositions: none have the descriptive titles usually associated with the French harpsichord school. Les pi√®ces d'orgue, Leb√®gue's first published organ collection, comprises eight suites, covering all eight modes. It is generally believed to be one of the finest French organ collections of the era, and also one of the most important for the development of the French organ school.Apel 1972, 727. Leb√®gue was probably the first among French composers to introduce independent pedal parts in his pieces. He also developed one of the most characteristic forms of French organ music‚Äîthe [R√©cit de] Tierce en taille‚Äîas well as the trio √† deux dessus, a three-voice polyphonic work with two parts for the right hand and one for the left (which is different from the other French organ trio form, the trio √† trois claviers, in which the organist must use two manuals and pedal). Compared to these innovative works, the pieces in Leb√®gue's second book are tame, probably because the composer deliberately set out to write for amateurs and beginners (as is indicated in the publisher's preface). The third organ collection presents many different types of pieces, some incorporating Italian influences (Premi√®re √©l√©vation), others modelled after Lully's orchestral overtures (the four symphonies).Apel 1972, 728. The nine no√´ls (variations on Christmas carols) are some of the earliest surviving examples of the genre. Only a few non-keyboard pieces by Leb√®gue are preserved: one hymn and a collection of motets published in 1687 in Paris as Motets pour les principales festes de l'ann√©e. While the hymn is a simple pseudo-plainchant tune, the motets are important, expertly crafted works, innovative in their use of the organ not as basso continuo throughout, but, in certain sections, as a concertante voice in the texture. They were composed for the Benedictine nuns of the convent of Val-de-Gr√¢ce. Other works, including a Vespers for two choirs, are lost. Notes References *Apel, Willi. 1972.

He served in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta from 1945 to 1959, first as an independent and then as a Liberal. He led the Alberta Liberal Party from 1948 to 1958 and served as a senator from 1966 until his death in 1976. Early life James Harper Prowse Jr. was born in Taber, Alberta, on November 3, 1913. He took his post-secondary education at the University of Alberta. World War II Prowse enlisted in the Canadian Army in 1940. He served five years overseas during the Second World War, mostly in the Italian Campaign, and rose to the rank of captain. He was wounded twice during combat. His army career ended after he was elected to the Alberta Legislature in the 1945 service vote. Provincial politics Prowse had been introduced to politics at a young age when his father, James Harper Prowse Sr., ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature in the 1926 general election in the electoral district of Taber. Prowse first ran for a seat in the legislature in the 1945 serviceman vote that was the last stage of the general election held the previous year. He ran as a candidate in the army vote and won the polls with 17% of the popular vote over 21 other candidates on February 5, 1945. The vote was non-partisan so Prowse sat as an independent in the legislature. After winning the election and returning to Edmonton, Prowse became a journalist for the Edmonton Bulletin. He crossed the floor to the Liberals after announcing his intention to run for the leadership of the party on April 10, 1947. He said of his decision, \\"The political situation has reached a point where there is no longer any advantage to be gained by remaining neutral.\\" Prowse was elected leader of the party on the first ballot at the Liberals' annual convention on June 26, 1947. The convention was attended by 476 delegates. He defeated two other candidates, Jonathan Wheatly and Joseph Tremblay. The serviceman seats were abolished after the end of the Second World War, and Prowse decided to contest a seat in the Edmonton electoral district in the 1948 Alberta election. He took the fourth of five seats in the multi-member district. The Liberal party won one other seat besides his own and took 17% of the popular vote. In the 1952 Alberta general election Prowse won the second seat in Edmonton. He led the Liberals to four seats and 22% of the popular vote. In the 1955 general election the Liberals made their best showing in decades, winning 15 seats and earning 31% of the popular vote. Prowse again took the second seat in Edmonton. Prowse stepped down as leader of the Liberal party in 1958 and retired from the legislature at dissolution in 1959. He did not run in the 1959 provincial election. He ran for mayor of Edmonton in the 1959 municipal election; he lost to Elmer Roper. Federal politics Prowse first ran for a seat to the House of Commons of Canada in the 1962 federal election in the electoral district of Edmonton West as a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. He finished a close second to incumbent Marcel Lambert and ahead of former Member of Parliament Orvis Kennedy. The minority parliament was dissolved less than a year later and so came the 1963 federal election. Prowse ran again in Edmonton West but still finished behind Lambert. Prowse was appointed to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Lester Pearson in 1967. He represented Edmonton there until his death on September 27, 1976.

The road and buildings Conduit Road was constructed in 1910. It is located in Western Mid-Levels. It is named after the aqueduct passing underneath which carries water from the Pok Fu Lam Reservoir to the Central area. It is at the highest point on Victoria Peak reached by the Central‚ÄìMid-levels escalators. It is also the second highest road; second to Po Shan Road; in Western Mid- Levels. The road was renamed as \\"Izumo-dori\\" (Âá∫Èõ≤ÈÄö) during Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. After the surrender and evacuation of Japanese army, its name was changed back. It is a luxury residential area. One of the road's earliest residents was Catchick Paul Chater, who built a magnificent residence at 1, Conduit Road named 'Marble Hall', whose gatehouse is the only reminder of this connection today. The road interchanges with Glenealy at the east-end with Hornsey Road intersecting next to the \\"slope section\\" near the east-end of the road. Kotewall Road, Po Shan Road, and Hatton Road at the west-end. The east-end is often considered as the start of the road with the rest being sparsely populated with less traffic. The Foreign Correspondents' Club, then located at 41A Conduit Road, is portrayed in the film as a hospital. The building was demolished in the late 1960s.Because of its long history, the residence found along it are at times relatively older and lower-standard than the more recent properties, and those found on the relatively newly developed Central Mid- Levels area. An example of the larger \\"old\\" residential apartments is Realty Gardens (No. 41) (recently renovated). Other similarly old properties include Elegant Garden (No.11), Panorama (No.15), Cliffview Mansions (No. 17-19 & 21‚Äì25); Conway Mansion (No.29) ; Woodland Gardens (No.62A ~ F) ; and Manly Mansion (No.44,44A). Other than Realty Gardens, all the other relatively old assets are concentrated very shallow into the road itself as proven by the almost-consecutive numbers. These properties are also all built on the northern side of the road, as shown by all the even numbers. The main reason for this is that there were no flat tough ground for foundations on the waterfront side (northern side) of the road 30‚Äì40 years ago, but only slopes of greenery. Furthermore, building them on the mountainside is easier and allows a more laid-back position with a better view of the Victoria Harbour. Thus the buildings standing along the eastern part and on the waterfront side of the road (northern side) were mostly built in recent times. They were built by removing sections of the mountain (so to add foundations) and/or extending the foundations from Robinson Road- the road one street-level lower. This is mostly the case for the near-eastern-end part of Conduit Road. In the past, until the early 1990s; the views of the harbour were mostly uninterrupted for the any mid-rise mountainside properties lining the mountainside near the eastern end of the road. (they have had to be of lesser height as they are elevated by the slope; the height limit was also very low 30‚Äì40 years ago). However, in the early 1990s, new properties began to be constructed by extending foundations from Robinson Road. And since the building height requirements became much more loose with the buildings being 30‚Äì40 storeys high, the harbour views were no more. Number 41A Conduit Road is a deeply secluded pre-war house blocked-from-view by Realty Gardens (No. 41) and is located on the hillside. Number 41, next door, had a wide history;A Brief History of Realty Gardens and its Environs not only did it feature as the original location of The Foreign Correspondents' ClubForeign Correspondents' Club ‚Äì History but it was also the hospital in the 1955 film Love Is a Many- Splendored Thing. Number 2 also has proven history and citywide recognition: it is renowned for housing influential Hong Kong socialites. Numbering Numbers are odd on the mountainside of the road and even on the side closer to waterfront; which makes sense since the first properties were built along the mountainside (southern side) of the road. The odd numbers starts at the busier eastern end of the road from the government estate Chater Hall Flats (No.1 Conduit Road) and ends at Skyline Mansion (No. 51 Conduit Road) near the western end of the road; while even numbers starts right across No.1, Yukon Court (No.2 Conduit Road) is its name, ran all the way through Kiu Sen Court (No.70 Conduit Road). Although there is currently a new residential building numbered 55 on the road which will technically forever be the last property on the road in terms of location (as the site is located on the last stretch of land on Conduit Road). Thus, the main reason for the particular direction of property-numbering was chiefly attributed by the fact that the first properties to have graced Conduit Road were all concentrated at the eastern end; which is understandable as that end is closer to the Central District than the western end giving it much higher accessibility and convenience. Lethal landslides On 7 December 1911, a major landslip, caused by heavy rainfall, killed four people at a building site. This occurred during excavation and heavy rain. On 18 June 1972, an even more devastating landslide occurred. It started from a redevelopment site on Conduit Road above Po Shan Road and slid down 270 meters to Kotewall Road crossing Conduit Road near number 53. Casualties were high with 67 people killed, 20 injured and 2 buildings totally destroyed. An estimated 40,000 cubic meters of earth and debris moved in this slip.HKU Large Landslides in Hong Kong ‚Äì Po Shan Road Landslide, June 1972 See also *List of streets and roads in Hong Kong *39 Conduit Road *Central‚ÄìMid-levels escalators References External links *Google Maps of Conduit Road Category:Roads in Hong Kong Category:Mid-Levels ","title":"Conduit Road"},{"id":"3900933","text":"The Pantages Theatre is a historic theatre in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

He is the first known Colegrove in America. His immigration is important in the fact that most people that bear the surname Colegrove in the United States can be traced back to him. In Colonial Rhode Island The earliest records of people with the name Colegrove in Britain can be traced to the 16th century and were found in the Oxfordshire area of England. The surname is thought to have originated from a grove along the little River Cole, in Wiltshire, Oxfordshire, a tributary to the River Thames, or the River Cole, West Midlands, a tributary of the River Tame, near Coleshill/Birmingham. Records can be scantly put together that seem to imply that Francis Colegrove Sr. came to America from England between 1680 and 1688. He had a daughter named Elizabeth around 1688. Francis married a woman named Ann in Rhode Island. A likely reason Francis moved to Rhode Island from Britain, was that many separatists and Baptists from the Swansea area of Wales were moving to the American colonies for religious and political freedom. Francis, who was a farmer, and his wife joined the Newport Sabbatarian Baptist Church of Newport, Rhode Island, which was the first Seventh Day Baptist group in North America in August 1698, being baptized as adults. Stephen Mumford came to the colonies in 1665, and formed the Newport Church, where Francis and Ann attended, in 1671. During the 17th century, many Baptists, as well as many non-conformists and separatists, found refuge from persecution in Britain and other colonies such as Massachusetts, in the colony of Rhode Island, which had been set up by Baptists Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson in the 1630s and 1640s. Family Francis and Ann Colegrove had at least five children, in addition to Elizabeth: their eldest, Jeremiah Colegrove, followed by Eli Colegrove (in 1689), Stephen Colegrove (1694), Francis Colegrove, Jr. (about 1697), and John Colegrove (1714). Jeremiah, their first son, died in 1710 at Port Royal, Nova Scotia during Queen Anne's War. Later life Francis was a farmer in the new world. There is record of his owning land in the \\"Narragansett Country\\", which was an area of Rhode Island named after the Narragansett (tribe) of Native Americans. He was given the land to recompense the loss of his son, who helped him with farming. Here is an excerpt on Francis, known by some today as \\"The Patriarch\\", from William Colegrove's Book (mentioned below): \\"He was evidently an active, enterprising, pioneer farmer, who attended to his own business and kept out of politics, --- thus setting an excellent example --- which has been followed by his descendants. The death of his oldest son seems to have been a severe blow to him in respect to his business, compelling him to ask a little relief from the Legislature of the Colony, --- which relief, it is pleasant to know, was readily granted. The following is from The R.I. Colonial Records, V. 4, p. 136; \\"Proceedings of R.I. and Prov. Plantations at Newport, 27 February 1711-12.\\"\\" A prominent land holder, Francis Colegrove owned land in other places. On June 28, 1709 a committee that had been formed by the Rhode Island general assembly, sold a large tract of land known as the 'Shannock Purchase' located near Richmond, Rhode Island. Francis was among the recipients of the land. Ann and Francis ended up in Westerly, Rhode Island by 1712, as there are records of Anne being involved in the Sabbatarian congregation there. Ann Colegrove died sometime after 1718, before Francis. No one knows for sure when Francis Colegrove died, but William Colegrove, author of the 1894 publication, The History and Genealogy of the COLEGROVE FAMILY in America, believed he may have died around 1759 or before in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. Previously, more conservative researchers suggested that he may have died sometime between 1725 and 1729. More recent research shows Francis Colegrove, Sr. still alive in 1728, when he was summoned to appear at a Church meeting in regard to a dispute between his son Francis, Jr. and a William James over payment of an ox that Francis Jr had given Mr. James. The committee found in favor of Francis Jr. In the Seventh-Day Baptist Memorial of 1874, which mentions the dispute, Francis Colegrove is listed still living and attending the Westerly congregation, with a second Francis Colegrove, probably Jr., in 1740 in \\"a list of members made up by a Committee of the church in 1740\\".

Back at school, the newest male teacher Mr. Kwon Sang-min (Lee Ji-hoon) is causing a stir with his handsome good looks, and every female teacher and student is falling for him. Mi-nam tries to apologize and unburden herself to Ms. Yeo, who ignores her while trying to impress Mr. Kwon. Mi-nam decides to compete for him as well, even getting his cellphone number. Mr. Kwon goes to Ms. Yeo for advice on how to deal with the students' affection, not realizing she likes him too. The teacher and the student start a heated rivalry that climaxes when Ms. Yeo slaps Mi-nam in class‚Äîand is recorded doing so on a student's cellphone camera. She resigns from the school but eventually makes amends with Mi-nam and returns to teach.

Starting the 2011 perihelion passage the primary component 73P-C was recovered on 28 November 2010 near apparent magnitude 21.3; it came to perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) on 16 October 2011. Comet Schwassmann‚ÄìWachmann 3 was one of the comets discovered by astronomers Arnold Schwassmann and Arno Arthur Wachmann, working at the Hamburg Observatory in Bergedorf, Germany. It began disintegrating on its re-entry to the inner Solar System in 1995, in a reaction triggered by the Sun's heating of the comet as it emerged from the colder regions of the outer Solar System. Comet 73P is a parent body of meteor shower Tau Herculids. The comet was discovered as astronomers were exposing photographic plates in search of minor planets for a minor planet survey, on May 2, 1930. The comet was lost after its 1930 apparition, but was observed several more times. 73P/Schwassmann‚ÄìWachmann has an orbital period of 5.4 years so that it comes nearest to the Earth every 16 years. The primary fragment 73P-C has an Earth-MOID of . 73P was originally estimated to have a core diameter of 1100 meters.  Breakup  In 1995, 73P began to disintegrate. It was seen to break into four large pieces labeled 73P-A, B, C, & D. As of March 2006, at least eight fragments were known: B, C, G, H, J, L, M & N. On April 18, 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope recorded dozens of pieces of fragments B and G. It appears that the comet may eventually disintegrate completely and cease to be observable (as did 3D/Biela in the 19th century), in which case its designation would change from 73P to 73D. In May 2006, it was known to have split into at least 66 separate objects. In April 2006, fragment C was the largest and the presumed principal remnant of the original nucleus. Video The fragments were passing the Earth in late April and early May 2006, coming nearest to the Earth around May 12 at a distance of about 11.9 million km (7.4 million miles), a close pass in astronomical terms (0.08 AU) though with no significant threat of comet‚ÄìEarth collision. In 1930 when it passed the Earth that close, there were meteor showers with as many as 100 meteors per minute. However, analysis by P. A. Wiegert et al.Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Volume 361, p. 638 The œÑ Herculid meteor shower and Comet 73P/Schwassmann‚ÄìWachmann 3 P. A. Wiegert, P. G. Brown, J. Vaubaillon and H. Schijns suggested that a recurrence of that spectacle was unlikely. The comet was to have been visited by the CONTOUR comet nucleus probe on June 18, 2006. Unfortunately, contact with the probe was lost on August 15, 2002 when it fired its Star 30BP solid rocket motor to inject itself into solar orbit.

Founded in 2004, they play their home games at the Caledonian Ground and Forsyth Barr Stadium. It is the southernmost football club playing in a top division league in the world. History Otago United logo 2004‚Äì13 Southern United was formed in 2004 as Otago United, competing in the New Zealand Football Championship. Based in Dunedin, Southern United, the sole representative from its federation, was one of eight teams competing in the league at the time. The club had 21 feeder clubs and 4 associations from within the geographic area from Timaru south to Invercargill. Lutz Pfannenstiel, the only player to play professionally on every FIFA continent, once called Otago United home. In the inaugural season, Otago United finished second from bottom, but improved to finish fifth out of eight in the next season. However, the club went from bad to worse in the 2006‚Äì07 season, finishing in dead last and ending the season being humiliated 8‚Äì0 by league winners Waitakere United. The following season was slightly better, finishing in seventh ahead of Canterbury United, despite achieving the record for the fewest goals scored in a season. The shortened 2008-09 season saw the team secure just two wins (both 2‚Äì1 over Canterbury United, home and away) and two draws (3‚Äì3 at home vs Waikato and 1‚Äì1 away vs Team Wellington). Despite the season been seven games shorter, they still managed to score three more goals than the previous season. After a good start to the 2011‚Äì12 season Otago United lost several key players and slumped to a run of one draw and seven defeats. A 3‚Äì3 draw with Waikato in the final game of the season earned them sixth spot on the table. The high points of manager Richard Murray's first year in charge were perhaps the blooding of several promising new young players and the selection of captain Tristan Prattley in the New Zealand national under-23 football team. The loss of Prattley (to Waitakere United) and New Zealand under-20 international representative Joel Stevens to injury midway through the season severely hampered Otago, and they could only finish in 7th place with just two wins ‚Äì avoiding the wooden spoon only on goal- difference. Coaches In their first season, Otago United was coached by former Fulham assistant Johan Koustall. The second season saw the arrival of former Irish international Terry Phelan to become the club's player/coach. This lasted for four seasons until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season where, due to poor results, he was replaced by his assistant Malcolm Fleming. Fleming coached for the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010‚Äì11 seasons, but in August 2011 stepped down citing lack of funds to bring in players from outside the region, concerns that playing young local players could be detrimental, and the need for changes on the Otago United board. In September 2011 it was announced that Caversham AFC coach Richard Murray would take the reins for the 2011‚Äì12 season. Richard Murray and assistant Andy Duncan were reappointed for the 2012‚Äì13 season, but after their worst ever points return in a season the reign of Murray and Duncan was over. The coaching position for the 2013-14 season was taken by Brazilian Luiz Uehara who approached the job with a long-term view and a desire to use local players; nevertheless he stated his prime focus was \\"on performance and playing a good level of football\\".http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/football/264681/football-uehara-coach- renamed-southern-united After Uehara's first season, a review following Southern United's second-last placing prompted the board to advertise the head coach position for the next two seasons. Uehara did not reapply for the position, stating he wanted to take a break from the game.http://www.odt.co.nz/sport/football/302286/football-uehara-fires-parting- shot Mike Fridge was appointed for two seasons starting in 2014‚Äì15, with Tony Martin as his assistant. Fridge's poor performance led to his eventual demise, with Irishman Paul O'Reilly later appointed as the new coach in July 2016. * Johan Koustall (2004‚Äì05) * Terry Phelan (1 July 2006 ‚Äì 30 June 2009) * Malcolm Fleming (1 July 2009 ‚Äì 30 June 2011) * Richard Murray (1 July 2011 ‚Äì 30 June 2013) * Luiz Uehara (1 July 2013 ‚Äì 30 June 2014) * Mike Fridge (1 July 2014 ‚Äì June 2016) * Paul O'Reilly (21 June 2016 ‚Äì ) Current squad Staff *Head Coach: Terry Boylan *Goalkeeper Coach: Zane Green *Medical: Jim Webb *Technical Analyst: Stuart Moffatt References External links * Profile at New Zealand Football Championship website * Official website Category:Association football clubs in Dunedin Category:Association football clubs established in 2004 Category:Sport in Otago Category:2004 establishments in New Zealand ","title":"Southern United FC"},{"id":"3900984","text":"Manawatu United (previously known as YoungHeart Manawatu) was a football club based in Palmerston North, New Zealand. It participated in the New Zealand Football Championship, and fielded a youth side in the National Youth League. Their home ground was Memorial Park. In 2014, the team was renamed to Manawatu United.  History  Manawatu United was formed in 2004, under the name YoungHeart Manawatu, to compete in the New Zealand Football Championship (NZFC). Based in Palmerston North, they were the sole franchise in the region. In the inaugural NZFC season (2004‚Äì2005), Manawatu United finished bottom of the league. However, in 2005‚Äì2006 they finished runner-up to champions Auckland City FC at the end of the regular season. In the finals, United lost both their playoff matches and exited early. The 2006‚Äì07 season saw Manawatu United finish second again at the conclusion of the regular season, this time behind Waitakere United. United lost their preliminary final to Auckland and missed out on a spot in the O-League as a result. 2007‚Äì08 was a somewhat disappointing campaign given the success of the previous two seasons. Manawatu United finished the regular season placed sixth on the table, well adrift of the playoffs. A return to the playoffs came in the 2008/09 season, as United finished in third place in the condensed regular season. What followed was an emphatic two-goal victory in the first leg of a two-legged semi-final against Auckland City FC in Palmerston North. In the return leg Auckland used their home advantage equally as well to win 3‚Äì0, consigning Manawatu to a 4‚Äì3 defeat on aggregate and another missed grand final and O-League appearance. Auckland went on to win the final. 2009‚Äì10 was a frustrating season for the Manawatu United faithful as the side finished in sixth place but only two points away from a playoff spot. Perhaps the highlight of the season was an unexpected 4‚Äì1 victory over Auckland City at Kiwitea Street. A bittersweet moment came during the 2010 off-season as standout young player Cory Chettleburgh signed a contract with professional Dutch club Sparta Rotterdam. This was a significant loss for the side as they looked to bounce back from a fairly disappointing campaign. At the conclusion of the 2012‚Äì13 season the franchise didn't have their league license renewed and were replaced by a New Zealand Under 20 squad Wanderers Special Club for the 2013‚Äì14 season although they retained a team in the ASB Youth League.  Folding  Due to the ASB Youth League being reduced to only the 10 teams given licenses to the 2016‚Äì17 ASB Premiership, Manawatu United dissolved at the end of the 2015 ASB Youth League Season.  Ground  Memorial Park was the home ground of Manawatu United. They had played at this ground since the 2008‚Äì09 season, having previously played their home fixtures at Central Energy Trust Arena. Memorial Park has a capacity of approximately 8000 people.

The name may have originated from a grove along the River Cole, Wiltshire, a tributary of the River Thames in England. Another explanation as to the origin of the name is from the Middle English cole ‚Äòcoal‚Äô + grave ‚Äòpit‚Äô, ‚Äògrave‚Äô (Old English col + gr√¶f). Other forms of spelling in the past include ‚ÄòColgrove‚Äô, ‚ÄòColegrave‚Äô, ‚ÄòColgrave‚Äô, ‚ÄòCoulgrove‚Äô. The first records of the Colegrove name were in 14th century England. The family name is found throughout the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Ireland and other nations. The first known mention of Colgrove as a surname was of one Johannes Colgrove of Kiddington, Oxfordshire from 1377 during the Poll Tax levied to finance the war against France by John of Gaunt. Over two hundred years later, there were still people with that surname in Kiddington and the surrounding towns, such as Swalcliffe, Oxfordshire. There were also place names in England with the name Colegrove. The earliest mention of which was in a grant of land from one \\"William de Colethrop\\" to his son John in Kemerton, Gloucestershire recorded in 1260. Another place named Colegrave was listed in Northaptonshire records in 1293 in The National Archives of the UK, and later in 1545 in Essex.

She first appeared in 1968 as the head of a vast global criminal and terrorist group in Wonder Woman, vol. 1, issue #179, written by Dennis O'Neil and illustrated by Mike Sekowsky and Dick Giordano. In her early appearances, Dr. Cyber was presented as a beautiful woman, apparently of Asian descent. Later, after her face was disfigured in an accident, she donned a gold muzzle-mask and technologically advanced exoskeleton. This cybernetic enhancement increased Cyber's physical strength, and gave her the ability to absorb energy, as well as to redirect it by firing blasts from her hands. Despite the resulting upgrades to her power, Dr. Cyber's disfigurement also wrought a mounting emotional instability. She became obsessed with recapturing her beauty by transferring her mind into Wonder Woman's body, a project she attempted several times with the help of her operative Doctor Moon. Fictional character biography =Pre-Crisis= Doctor Cyber was the beautiful and commanding presence behind a global criminal network around the same time when Wonder Woman had relinquished her powers when her fellow Amazons retreated into another dimension. Prior to Cyber's first encounter with the depowered Amazon, her henchmen plundered the monastery of I Ching for the gems and precious metals within and slaughtered the resisting monks. Colonel Steve Trevor unsuccessfully attempted to infiltrate Cyber's network, but learned of their plot: to create chaos within the US Government by sending bombs inside toys to the children of Congressmen. This plot was actually a ruse to divert attention from a London jewel heist, foiled by Wonder Woman and I Ching. Doctor Cyber escaped only to resurface in Hong Kong several weeks later. (Wonder Woman #179-182 [November‚ÄìDecember 1968‚ÄîMay‚ÄìJune 1969]) In Hong Kong, Doctor Cyber's plan was to destroy the city and blackmail the world with a series of devices that could create earthquakes. Cyber lured the non-powered Diana Prince to the Asian city hoping to entice her into joining the organization, which she steadfastly refused. Soon afterward, an attack by the rival Tiger Tong gang resulted in an urn of hot coals spilling onto Cyber's face. The villainess was evacuated to a secret hospital outside of Hong Kong, swearing revenge on Diana Prince for her disfigurement. Prince stopped the earthquake plot and Cyber was believed killed when her final earthquake device exploded. (Wonder Woman #187-188 [March‚ÄìApril 1970‚ÄîMay‚ÄìJune 1970]) When Diana Prince teamed up with private detective Jonny Double to stop an organization called the Tribunal, she discovered that Doctor Cyber had survived their previous encounter. Cyber had created the Tribunal to find a suitable woman to transplant her brain and replace her disfigured body. After Prince's capture, Cyber unsuccessfully attempted to have her brain transplanted into Diana by Doctor Moon. During this encounter, Cyber was accidentally impaled by a scalpel and believed killed once again. (Wonder Woman #200 [May‚ÄìJune 1972]) On an assignment at a Catskill Mountain resort as Diana Prince, Wonder Woman again discovered that Doctor Cyber had cheated death. While investigating a number of murders at the resort, Cyber battled Wonder Woman after an unsuccessful attempt to graft the Amazon's face onto her own. The ensuing mel√©e ended with Cyber seemingly falling to her death from atop a ski lift. (Wonder Woman #221 [December 1975-January 1976]) Doctor Cyber laid low for several months before capturing Wonder Girl in another attempt to capture Wonder Woman for a brain transplant. Wonder Woman agreed to trade her life for her adopted sister, but both were rescued by the Teen Titans. Cyber and her partner, Dr. Moon, were finally captured. (Wonder Woman #287 [January 1982]) It is unknown if Doctor Cyber was released or escaped from custody, but she disguised herself as Diana Prince, infiltrated the Pentagon, and stole the launch codes to America's nuclear missiles. Wonder Woman averted the attempted nuclear war, but Cyber was killed attempting to flee from her and Steve Trevor (disguised as the god Eros) when her rocket sled crashed into the side of a cliff. (Wonder Woman #319-321 [September‚ÄìNovember 1984]) During the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Brainiac assumedly retrieved Doctor Cyber sometime prior to her death and assigned her to team-up with several other villains to conquer Earth-S. Doctor Cyber was finally excised from the DC Universe after the conclusion of Crisis. =Post-Crisis= The second Doctor Cyber first appeared, chronologically, in post-Crisis continuity in The Power Company #1 (April 2002). Cyber, together with several other scientific geniuses and robotic beings (Automan, Brainstorm, Emil Hamilton, Ford, and Rosie the Riveter), was for a brief period part of the composite cybernetic being called Enginehead. However (if this story is still canon), the being seems to have been divided into the individual personalities again shortly after the events of the series.Enginehead #1-6 (2004) Cyber is later shown re-introduced into the Wonder Woman comic by battling Donna Troy (the new Wonder Woman) and Cassie Sandsmark (the current Wonder Girl). (September 2006) During the Infinite Crisis storyline, Doctor Cyber popped up as a member of Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s Secret Society of Super Villains. =DC Rebirth= After the events of DC Rebirth, Doctor Cyber was reintroduced as Dr. Adrianna Anderson, a research scientist for Empire Industries and a close friend to the company's CEO, Veronica Cale.Wonder Woman #15 (Mar 2017) Soon after Diana left Themyscira and returned Steve Trevor to the United States, Cale's daughter Isadore was kidnapped by the gods Deimos and Phobos. In order to reclaim her soul, the twin gods ordered Cale and Anderson to use the experimental Cyberwalker system to find the location of Themyscira from Wonder Woman. Adrianna immediately volunteered to use the Cyberwalker suit out of fear of losing her only friend. Connected to the Cyberwalker, Adrianna battled Wonder Woman. However, the Cyberwalker suit began to malfunction with Adrianna's mind trapped inside. Despite efforts by Veronica Cale to save her friend, Adrianna died.Wonder Woman #16 (Apr 2017) Over a year later, Veronica Cale created an artificial construct of Adrianna using what was left of her neural map in the Cyberwalker system. After learning that her physical body had died, Adrianna chose to take the name Doctor Cyber. Veronica recruited Doctor Cyber into helping her get her daughter back. She was instrumental in the transformation of Barbara Ann Minerva into becoming the Cheetah by disabling the GPS signaling device Wonder Woman had given her, as well as keeping Wonder Woman distracted with various disasters so that she would be unable to save Minerva.Wonder Woman #18 (May 2017) Doctor Cyber also later aided Veronica Cale in summoning the witch Circe in order to bind Deimos and Phobos into the forms of dogs.Wonder Woman #20 (Jun 2017) As the search for Themyscira grew, Doctor Cyber worked as a member of Veronica Cale's Godwatch organization, often sharing intel with Doctor Poison and her agents. She also participated in the coercion of Barbara Ann Minerva returning to her Cheetah form.Wonder Woman #17 (Apr 2017) When Wonder Woman and her allies journeyed to Veronica Cale's home for answers, they were confronted by Doctor Cyber, who revealed that she had been manipulating Diana for years. She accused Wonder Woman for murdering her by bringing her gods with her. After several taunts, her computers are smashed and destroyed by Ferdinand the Minotaur.Wonder Woman #19 (May 2017) Meanwhile, traveling over the Black Sea, Doctor Cyber apologized to Veronica Cale for not being able to stall Wonder Woman longer.Wonder Woman #21 (Jun 2017) After finally reuniting with Isadore, Veronica Cale returned to her home where she dismissed Doctor Cyber as being simply an AI created from Adrianna Anderson. After erasing their illegal tracks, Doctor Cyber left Veronica Cale.Wonder Woman #24 (Aug 2017) Some time later, Doctor Cyber returned to Empire Industries to help Veronica Cale capture the Cheetah.Wonder Woman #46 (Jul 2018) Powers and abilities The first Doctor Cyber had no powers but wore an armored suit that allowed her to physically fight Wonder Woman on near-equal terms. The suit enhanced her strength and endurance and also allowed her to redirect energy when fired at the suit. She also used a variety of weaponry that included laser pistols, mind control serum, an invisibility screen, rocket sleds, and myriad robot assassins. After her disfigurement she often used plain and unattractive women as henchmen so as not to be reminded of her lost beauty. The second Doctor Cyber also wore an armored suit, but while its full abilities and limitations are as yet unknown, in keeping with her name they are more implicitly cybernetic in nature.

The story centers on the troubled marriage of a scrupulous American wife and a far from scrupulous French husband, and is told mostly from the point of view of a male friend of the wife. The tale reflects the intense interest James took in the \\"international theme,\\" especially early in his career. One of the longest fictions he had yet attempted, the smoothly narrated story shows that James was rapidly maturing in style and technique. Plot summary A wealthy American man named Longmore is introduced to his countrywoman Euphemia de Mauves, wife of the Comte Richard de Mauves. Longmore and Madame de Mauves become friends, and he visits her frequently in Paris. Superficially, Madam de Mauves leads a happy life with a wealthy and \\"irreproachably polite\\" husband, but Longmore soon becomes convinced that she harbours a deep sadness. It gradually becomes clear that the Comte is an unscrupulous and dissipated man who married his wife for her money alone. As a youth, Madame de Mauves had been naive and idealistic, believing that the Comte de Mauves' title guaranteed a fine character. The Comte, however, proved to have little regard for his wife, and had embarked on a series of extramarital affairs. Even his politeness \\"was hardly more than a form of luxurious egotism, like his fondness for cambric handkerchiefs.... In after years he was terribly polite to his wife.\\" Madame de Mauves' faith in her ideals is destroyed, but she responds with stoic resignation. Longmore falls in love with Madame de Mauves, but, understanding that he cannot be her lover, and believing that she desperately needs a friend, he tries to sublimate his love into friendship. This attitude is reinforced by Madame de Mauves, who welcomes his friendship, but is hostile to any sentiment on his part. However both the Comte de Mauves and his sister, the crass widow Madame de Clairin, hint that Longmore should woo Madame de Mauves. The Comte wishes her to take a lover so that he may be free to pursue his own affair. As tensions mount, the Comte openly breaks with his wife, Madame de Clairin urges Longmore to woo Madame de Mauves, and then she tells Madame de Mauves what she has told Longmore. Longmore agonises over how to proceed; he finds it difficult even to decide to continue his daily visits: \\"His presence now might be simply a gratuitous cause of suffering; and yet his absence might seem to imply that it was in the power of circumstances to make them ashamed to meet each other's eyes.\\" Eventually he visits Madame de Mauves, who rather cryptically asks him to confirm her very high opinion of him by doing the proper thing: \\"Don't disappoint me. If you don't understand me now, you will to-morrow, or very soon. When I said just now that I had a very high opinion of you, I meant it very seriously. It was not a vain compliment. I believe that there is no appeal one may make to your generosity which can remain long unanswered. If this were to happen,‚Äîif I were to find you selfish where I thought you generous, narrow where I thought you large, ... vulgar where I thought you rare,‚ÄîI should think worse of human nature. I should suffer,‚ÄîI should suffer keenly. I should say to myself in the dull days of the future, 'There was one man who might have done so and so; and he, too, failed.' But this shall not be. You have made too good an impression on me not to make the very best. If you wish to please me forever, there's a way.\\" After much reflection, Longmore concludes that she wishes him to voluntarily break off contact ‚Äî to do so not because she has dismissed him, not because there has been a 'scene', and not with any promise of meeting again in future, but simply because it is the honourable thing to do. The next day Longmore leaves for America. At his last meeting with the Comte he receives the impression that the Comte may be starting to repent of his behaviour; Longmore feels threatened by this: \\"he felt that it would be far more tolerable in the future to think of his continued turpitude than of his repentance.\\" Longmore remains in love with Madame de Mauves, despite having had no contact with her. Two years later, he hears that the Comte has committed suicide. The Comte had indeed repented, and had begged his wife to forgive him, but Madame de Mauves had remained as stoically unforgiving as she had been stoic in her resignation: \\"[H]e fell madly in love with her now. He was the proudest man in France, but he had begged her on his knees to be readmitted to favor. All in vain! She was stone, she was ice, she was outraged virtue. People noticed a great change in him: he gave up society, ceased to care for anything, looked shockingly. One fine day they learned that he had blown out his brains.\\" Euphemia is now free, and Longmore's first instinct is to go to her. However he puts off leaving for Europe from day to day for several years, because \\"The truth is, that in the midst of all the ardent tenderness of his memory of Madame de Mauves, he has become conscious of a singular feeling,‚Äîa feeling for which awe would be hardly too strong a name.\\" Themes In this story James' international theme takes a tragic and even perverse turn, as the marriage of a somewhat puritanical American woman and an easy-living, pagan Frenchman leads to despair and suicide. Whether an affair between Longmore and Euphemia (suggested by the amoral Richard and his equally cynical sister Madame de Clairin) would have made any difference is doubtful, but things couldn't have turned out much worse under any circumstances. Longmore is somewhat typical of James' male protagonists, hesitant about taking action and entering fully into life. Even at the end of the story he can't decide whether to return to Euphemia. This paralysis of the will affects many of James' central characters, but Longmore is extreme even by Jamesian standards in his uncertainty and indecision. The final lesson seems to be that American idealism and European sophistication can make for a dangerous, even lethal mixture. James would write many more fictions about the clash of America and Europe, leading to the ultimate synthesis in The Golden Bowl. In that much later novel, a marriage similar to the one in Madame de Mauves is saved by the kind of careful diplomacy that neither spouse in the earlier story is capable of. Critical evaluation Much critical dispute has arisen over Richard's suicide after Euphemia's refusal to reconcile with him. Some commentators find it frankly incredible that his wife's rebuff would drive Richard to self- destruction. Others maintain that such a man could easily sicken of life and decide to end it all, but have doubted that he could ever have repented and asked Euphemia's forgiveness in the first place. Although the believability of the story's conclusion is somewhat in doubt, many critics agree that James narrates the tale in a more assured and masterful manner than he had demonstrated in any of his previous fictions. James' decade-long apprenticeship in short narrative was starting to pay off, and he would soon begin his productive career in the full-length novel.

Plot  N√≥i Kristmundsson is a 17-year-old living in a small unnamed remote fishing village in western Iceland with his grandmother L√≠na (Anna Fri√∞riksd√≥ttir). His father Kiddi (√ûr√∂stur Le√≥ Gunnarsson), an alcoholic taxi driver, also lives in town, but N√≥i appears to have a distant relationship with him. As an alopecia totalis his appearance is strikingly different from others in the village. Much of his time is spent either wandering the desolate town, at the town bookstore, or in a hidden cellar at his grandmother's house, which serves as his private sanctuary. The town is a sort of purgatory for N√≥i, surrounded by mountains and attainable only by boat during the winter, when the roads through the mountain passes are snowed over. There are signs that N√≥i is highly intelligent, but he is totally uninterested in school and seems to have an adversarial relationship with the faculty, particularly his math teacher. More often than not he cuts class to go to the local gas station, where he frequently breaks into the slot machine and rigs it for an assured jackpot. The bleak town seem to offer few prospects for the future, and N√≥i doesn't seem to fit in there. Things begin to change for N√≥i when he encounters the new gas station attendant, an attractive young woman who is new to the village. He asks about the new girl to √ìskar (Hjalti R√∂gnvaldsson) the bookstore owner, who informs him that she is his daughter √çris (El√≠n Hansd√≥ttir), up from the south to escape the city, and to stay away from her. N√≥i instead begins a tentative romance with √çris. One night they break into the local natural history museum, and are almost caught by a nightwatchman. They hide in a storage closet, where they discover a light-up map of the world. N√≥i comments that Iceland looks like a spitwad on the map, and √çris suggests that they run away together. N√≥i asks where, and √çris suggests he press a button on the map and the Hawaiian Islands light up. This is when N√≥i begins to dream of leaving the village and Iceland altogether. He receives a View-Master as an 18th birthday present from his grandmother, which comes with slide disc of tropical island images. He is particularly transfixed with an image of a tropical beach, the total opposite of his immediate surroundings. One day at school, he is asked by the principal to meet with a specialist. The specialist asks him a series of questions, including \\"How many times a day do you masturbate?\\" Nœåi responds by asking the specialist the same question, simultaneously solving a Rubik's Cube. The specialist becomes embarrassed, states that he is the one asking the questions, and gives him an IQ test to complete. Later, N√≥i uses a tape recorder to take his place in math class, which enrages the teacher. The teacher goes to the principal, insisting that Nœåi is a disruptive influence and must be expelled immediately. The principal is hesitant, but he is forced to expel Nœåi after the teacher gives the ultimatum that either Nœåi goes or he will resign. Nœåi angrily leaves the school, knowing that his father will be upset with him. He tells him, and a small altercation between them results. Afterwards his father takes him out to a local bar, where he is kicked out for smuggling liquor and underage drinking. He goes to √ìskar's house in search of ƒ∫ris, climbing up onto the roof, where he is discovered by √ìskar. √ìskar tells him he's sent her back, at which point √çris comes down the stairs. √çris insists that N√≥i stay the night, over √ìskar's objections. His grandmother goes to a local fortune teller, Gylfi (Kjartan Bjargmundsson), and requests that he give N√≥i a fortune reading, to maybe give him some direction. N√≥i is working as a grave digger at this time, and goes to see Gylfi on a lunch break. After reading the tea leaves, Gylfi becomes visibly upset, informing N√≥i that his future is filled with death. N√≥i, thinking that Gylfi is teasing him, calls him a moron and leaves. Soon after, N√≥i leaves his job, getting his grandmother's shotgun. He attempts to rob a bank, but is thwarted when the bank teller doesn't take him seriously and has the gun taken out of his hands by the bank manager, who angrily pushes him out onto the street. He comes back inside the bank thoroughly humiliated and withdraws all of the money in his account, using it to buy a nice suit. He then steals a car, intending to run away with √çris. She is confused by his arrival and instead looks blankly at him. He realizes that she is not coming with him, and leaves. His car becomes stuck in the snow, and he is quickly apprehended by the police. His father bails him out of jail and takes him home. On the way back they stop at the gas station, where √çris is pumping gas. The father comments that she seems to have gained weight, a ploy he has taught to N√≥i as a sure way to get women to sleep with you. N√≥i shrinks down in his seat, embarrassed. N√≥i arrives home and descends into his cellar sanctuary. Suddenly, the earth shudders violently, and the light goes out. N√≥i finds his lighter and tries to escape out of the cellar, but is unable to open the overhead door, and lies down on the floor, watching his lighter until the fuel runs out. He is eventually awoken by the door above him being ripped open. He discovers that there was an avalanche, which has destroyed the house and killed his grandmother and father. At a rescue shelter, he watches the news report and discovers that nearly everyone he knows has been killed in the avalanche, including √çris. Gylfi, his prophecy fulfilled, has also perished. He later returns to the rubble of his grandmother's house to retrieve the View-Master. The movie ends with N√≥i looking at the tropical beach scene slide as it slowly becomes a vision of a real tropical beach.  DVD details  MPAA: Rated PG-13 for language and brief nudity.

Ron and his brother had built some specials in Australia in the 1950s under the Ralt name (standing for Ron and Austin Lewis Tauranac). Tauranac won the 1954 NSW Hillclimb Championship in the Ralt 500. Cars =Early Ralts= Built with the assistance of Tauranac's younger brother, Austin, in Australia. The Mk was powered by a 1,932cc pushrod Norton ES2. Tauranac made his own flywheel, connecting rods, and cylinders. The Mk2 was a sports car built by and for Austin, with a Ford 10 engine, Standard 10 gearbox, and Morris 8 rear axle. The Mk3 was purchased from the Hooper brothers when they retired. Tauranac designed a new chassis for it, and the car was primarily driven by Austin. The Mk4 began as a special, using a Vincent-HRD V-twin and a de Dion rear suspension. The car took two years to develop in Tauranac's spare time. After just two events, somebody insisted on buying it, so plans were made for a production run of five. The Mk5 was planned by Austin as a Peugeot-engined car, but abandoned so he could assist Tauranac with the production Mk 4s. 500 Race website article =Modern Ralts= RT1 at the DAMC 05 Oldtimer Festival N√ºrburgring Tauranac founded Ralt in 1974 and the first product was the RT1, a simple and versatile car used in Formula Two, Formula Three and Formula Atlantic racing between 1975 and 1978. In 1979, the RT2 was developed for Formula Two, with three cars being built for the Toleman team. Later, three more cars were built for private owners, including one exclusively for the revival of the Can-Am series. For 1980 Toleman built its own car, the TG280, which was based somewhat on the RT2 design; this was later built under licence by Lola as the T850 and further modified by Docking-Spitzley as the DS1. Two of the original Toleman RT2s were later raced in Can-Am, while the third ended up in South Africa, where copies called Lants were made. Related cars have appeared in hillclimb and sprint events in the UK as Romans and SPAs. The RT2 also provided the basis for three cars in other categories: the RT3 in Formula Three, the RT4 in Formula Atlantic (which was also occasionally raced in Formula Two), and the RT5 in Formula Super Vee. The RT4 was the car of choice in Australian Formula 1 and Formula Mondial during the early to mid-1980s. Roberto Moreno drove an RT4 to win the Australian Grand Prix in 1981, 1983, and the final AGP in 1984 before it became a round of the Formula One World Championship in 1985, while Alain Prost also drove one to victory in the 1982 Australian Grand Prix. Other F1 drivers to drive a Ralt RT4 in Australia during this period included Jacques Laffite and Andrea de Cesaris, as well as World Champions Alan Jones, Nelson Piquet, Keke Rosberg and Niki Lauda. The RT4, generally powered by a 1.6 litre, 4 cyl Ford BDA engine which produced around , also saw John Bowe win the Australian Drivers' Championship in 1984 and 1985, while Australian Ralt importer Graham Watson used one to win the 1986 championship. =Works F2 cars= In 1980, Honda asked John Judd's Engine Developments to develop an engine for Formula Two, which would be used by the works Ralt team. Tauranac had previously been associated with Honda through Brabham's introduction of the Japanese marque to F2 in the 1960s, while Jack Brabham had co-founded Engine Developments with Judd. Between 1980 and 1984, Ralt's works F2 cars carried the RH6 designation: the RH6/80 and RH6/81 were developments of the RT2 theme, while the RH6/82, RH6/83 and RH6/84 were further developed around a new honeycomb tub. The cars proved very successful, winning 20 championship races and the 1981, 1983 and 1984 championships with Geoff Lees, Jonathan Palmer and Mike Thackwell respectively. =Formula 3000 cars= In 1985, Formula Two was replaced by the new Formula 3000 category. Ralt's first F3000 car was the RB20, essentially a further development of the RH6/84 but fitted with a Cosworth DFV engine. (The 'B' in the designation stood for Bridgestone, Ralt's tyre supplier and major sponsor at the time.) The car won four races of the inaugural International F3000 Championship with Thackwell and John Nielsen. RT23 For 1986, the RT20 was developed - a cheaper, more economical car with a traditional aluminium tub that was easier to maintain. Honda returned as the engine supplier for the works team, while customers used Cosworths. The works team won one race with Thackwell, while Pierluigi Martini and Luis P√©rez-Sala won four races between them in customer cars entered by the Italian Pavesi Racing team. The RT21 was a further development for 1987, again incorporating honeycomb elements in the monocoque; Honda continued to supply the works team, with Roberto Moreno and Maur√≠cio Gugelmin winning one race each. 1988 was to be Ralt's last year as an independent chassis supplier and team in F3000. The RT22 was its first carbon- fibre F3000 car, but with Lola and newcomers Reynard beginning to dominate the category, it achieved little success. In the autumn of 1988, Tauranac sold Ralt to the March Group. The Ralt name reappeared in F3000 in 1991, when the RT23 was manufactured under the March Group's auspices. Jean-Marc Gounon won at Pau in an RT23 entered by Mike Earle's 3001 International team, but otherwise the car was unsuccessful. An updated version, the RT24, was built by Nick Wirth's Simtek company for 1992, but soon after, Ralt withdrew from F3000 for good. Second-hand Ralt F3000 cars were used extensively in Australia's Formula Holden category from its introduction in 1989, fitted with the formula's 3.8-litre Holden V6 engine. Rohan Onslow won the 1989 Australian Drivers' Championship in an RT20, while Simon Kane won the 1990 championship in an RT21. =Formula Three cars= RT 3RT3 has a long history - a 1979 ground effect Formula Three car which was enhanced every year until 1984, becoming the dominant car in the formula. Ayrton Senna won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship driving an RT3. RT30 was introduced for the flat- bottom rules coming into effect in 1985. This was notable mainly for being very asymmetric - it had only one sidepod containing a radiator, and a deformable structure panel on the other side. The RT30 was, like many Ralts, developed over several seasons, evolving by the 1985‚Äì6 seasons into a highly competitive car, although some teams converted their old RT30s into flat- bottom cars and enjoyed a measure of success with these.http://www.f3history.co.uk/Manufacturers/Ralt/ralt.htm F3 History article RT34RT31, the 1987 car, applied some of the honeycomb ideas from the RT21 F3000 car; it was fairly competitive but Gary Brabham's experiments with lowering the engine showed the way ahead. RT32: for the 1988 season, Brabham's modifications were incorporated and a honeycomb/carbon tub was adopted. The RT32 theme saw Ralt through to the end of Tauranac's time with them, subsequent RT33 (1989)- RT35 (1991) cars essentially being developments of this basic model. The 1992 RT36 was designed by Andy Thorby and lightly revised by Tauranac for 1993 as the RT37. These cars were not particularly successful in Formula Three (in part because many teams switched to Dallara chassis and therefore did not develop them) but the basic monocoque continues to be extremely successful as a hillclimb car nearly fifteen years later. The Ralt 94C was designed by Chris Radage and was not a success. =Later Formula Atlantic variants= The RT40 and RT41 were Formula Atlantic derivatives of the later Formula Three cars; the RT40 was the last Ralt with which Tauranac was involved. Many Champcar World Series and Indy Racing League drivers past and present, honed their skills in these cars, including Jacques Villeneuve, the 1995 Indy 500 winner and 1997 F1 World Champion. After being phased out of the Pro Atlantic series in 1998 in favor of the Swift 008a, the Ralt RT40s and 41s are still being raced competitively (2007) in the Sports Car Club of America, some 13‚Äì14 years after the RT40's debut, winning the SCCA Championship as recently as 2003. Originally equipped for Pro Atlantic racing with a highly tuned variant of the Toyota 4A-GE twin cam engine displacing 1.6 litres and developing approximately 250 bhp; several of these chassis have been converted both with bodywork to compete in SCCA C Sports Racer (CSR) and now Prototype 1 (P1) with other engine packages such as the twin rotor 13b Mazda, Honda and Cosworth 1600. Ralt in other hands Ralt's 1988 Formula 3000 car was proving a challenge to develop; the works drivers' backers (for the first time, Tauranac was running paying drivers rather than paying his own) encouraged them to leave the team and not pay up; the company was also suffering from loss of its American markets for RT4s (Swift were upping the stakes dramatically) and RT5s (SuperVee was on its last legs in the US as a major category). Reynard's aggressive marketing was cutting into the F3000 and F3 markets. Tauranac was looking to sell the company and ultimately ended up selling out to March for just over a million pounds; they had concentrated on high-value bespoke racing cars and allowed their customer cars to atrophy so the merger appeared to be a good move. The subsequent history of Ralt as part of March is complex, but can be summarised as - operated as March's customer car division for a couple of years, was part of a management buyout when the March Group board decided to divest itself of all its motor racing interests; bought by enthusiasts Andrew Fitton and Steve Ward in 1993. Tauranac left from the firm soon after. Fitton and Ward wound March up, but Ward continued operating Ralt independently - the Ralt name continues, and Ralt F3 cars have occasionally appeared. Tauranac post-Ralt Tauranac remained involved with various aspects of the sport after departing from Ralt, including racing- school cars for Honda, a Formula Renault car, consulting work for the Arrows formula one team, and continued his relationship with Honda that went back to their early Formula Two days as engine supplier to Brabham in the 1960s. Ralt Australia was run by New Zealander Graham Watson until his death in 2009.

It is made either by submerging the coca leaf or dipping a tea bag in hot water. The tea is most commonly consumed in the Andes mountain range, particularly Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and especially in Peru, where it is consumed all around the country. It is greenish yellow in color and has a mild bitter flavor similar to green tea with a more organic sweetness. Though also known as mate, mate de coca has very little in common with the yerba mate drink in Southeastern South America. Alkaloid content and stimulant properties A cup served in left The leaves of the coca plant contain alkaloids which‚Äîwhen extracted chemically‚Äîare the source for cocaine base. However, the amount of coca alkaloid in the raw leaves is small. A cup of coca tea prepared from one gram of coca leaves (the typical contents of a tea bag) contains approximately 4.2 mg of organic coca alkaloid. > (In comparison, a typical dose (a \\"line\\") of cocaine contains between 20 and 30 milligrams.) Owing to the presence of these alkaloids, coca tea is a mild stimulant; its consumption may be compared to consumption of a moderately strong cup of coffee or tea. The coca alkaloid content of coca tea is such that the consumption of one cup of coca tea can cause a positive result on a drug test for cocaine, however. Similar to decaffeination in coffee, coca tea can be decocainized. Just as decaffeinated coffee retains a small quantity of caffeine, decocainized coca tea will still contain a small quantity of organic coca alkaloids. Legal status Coca tea is legal in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina, and Ecuador. However, its use is being discouraged in part by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. Coca tea is illegal in the United States unless it is decocainized.

Scanlon was born in Melbourne, to parents who had emigrated from Britain. His mother brought him back from Australia to the UK when he was two years old; she was by that time a widow. He attended Stretford Elementary School in Stretford near Manchester, which he left at the age of 11 to become an apprentice instrument maker at a local engineering firm where he first joined his union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU). Scanlon next worked at the Metropolitan-Vickers engineering plant at Trafford Park where he became a shop steward, before attaining the position of convener for the plant. He joined the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1937 following the events of the Spanish Civil War and made use of its networks and organising skills to rise through the union, becoming a district official in 1947. Although Scanlon formally abandoned communism in 1954, he continued as a \\"broad left\\" candidate within the union - winning the leadership in 1968. Scanlon and TGWU leader Jack Jones were known by the press as \\"The Terrible Twins\\" for their opposition to both Labour Party and Conservative Party attempts to restrict the power of the unions - Labour prime minister Harold Wilson once famously telling him to \\"get your tanks off my lawn.\\" In 1969 Home Secretary James Callaghan requested action that would hinder Scanlon's career, which was raised in cabinet, and further discussed with Secretary of State for Employment Barbara Castle. A plan for detrimental leaks to the media was placed in the Foreign Office propaganda Information Research Department, and its head prepared a briefing paper. However information about how this was effected has not been released under the thirty-year rule under a section of the Public Records Act permitting national security exemptions. When Edward Heath failed to form a coalition with the Liberals in 1974 and Labour formed a minority government, Scanlon and Jones acted as go-betweens for Labour, communicating the party's demands back and forth to Congress House. They were the prime movers within the union movement of the Social Contract which introduced strict wage controls and limits on strike action. This culminated in the 1978/79 Winter of Discontent, which was followed by the election of the Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, in 1979. Earlier in the decade, Scanlon had been a vocal opponent of Britain's membership of the EEC.David Butler and Uwe Kitzinger, The 1975 Referendum (London: Macmillan, 1976), p. 13, p. 201, p. 256. Scanlon's political beliefs led to his being effectively blacklisted by the British security service from 1966 to 1977, it emerged years later. In 1977, he was prevented from becoming chairman of British Shipbuilders because MI5 advised that he should not see documents marked \\"confidential\\" or above. Two years earlier, he was refused security clearance to join the British Gas Board, but was later appointed after his files were examined. He was elevated to the House of Lords as a Life Peer on 19 February 1979, taking the title Baron Scanlon, of Davyhulme in the County of Greater Manchester.

It was rededicated in 1941 and named in honor of Curry Hicks, who had been the athletic director at the school since 1911. With a capacity of 4,000, the venue served as the site of indoor athletic contests including men's basketball from its opening until January 1993 when it was replaced by the more modern and much larger Mullins Center. While the basketball team played at the Cage, it was known as one of the loudest buildings in the Northeast. It was the site of the 1992 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball tournament championship game, when UMass defeated West Virginia, 97-91. One of the most memorable events in The Cage's history may be the Temple/UMass men's basketball game on February 16, 1992. UMass had never beaten Temple in 21 attempts, but the rivalry had intensified greatly in recent contests. Much of the crowd stormed the court after the final buzzer, as UMass won 67-52. During its final years as the Minutemen's basketball home, home games came to be marketed as \\"Rage in the Cage\\". Perhaps appropriately, the final Minutemen home game before the opening of the Mullins Center was against Southwestern Louisiana (now Louisiana)‚Äîthe \\"Ragin' Cajuns\\".

His father was Jewish and his mother was Lutheran. Leopold Damrosch was baptized a Lutheran when marrying his wife, former opera singer Helene von Heimburg. Damrosch began his musical education at the age of nine, learning the violin against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to become a doctor. Capitulating to the wishes of his parents he entered the University of Berlin and completed his PhD in medicine but during his spare time he studied violin under Ries, and thoroughbass with Dehn and Bohmer. After he completed his degree Damrosch decided to dedicate his life and energy to music. He gained fame as a violinist and began to play to large audiences in many major German cities including Berlin and Hamburg. He went to Weimar, and was received by Franz Liszt, who appointed him solo-violinist in the Ducal orchestra. It has been said mistakenly that Liszt dedicated his Symphonic poem ‚Ññ 2 (Tasso, Lamento e Trionfo) to Damrosch. However, Liszt did dedicate the similarly named Le Triomphe fun√®bre du Tasse, the third part of Trois odes fun√®bres, to Damrosch who conducted the first performance in New York on March 24, 1877. Damrosch first appeared as a conductor during the season of 1859 where he conducted the Philharmonic concerts in Breslau. He continued to conduct the Philharmonic for three years due to the success of this season. In 1862 Damrosch founded a symphonic society in Breslau with an orchestra of eighty performers, modelled after the Gewandhaus concerts of Leipzig. This society gained fame throughout Germany and Damrosch invited Liszt to conduct several of the performances, an invitation which he accepted. Wagner also accepted the invitation to conduct his own manuscript compositions in the winter of 1867. In 1871, Damrosch emigrated to the United States of America at the invitation of the Arion Society in New York. At his first concerts in the United States he introduced himself as conductor, composer, and violinist. At his successful debut in New York on 6 May 1871, Leopold Damrosch played as violin soloist at the first time with the New York Philharmonic, performing Beethoven Violin concerto with his own cadenza on the program at the Academy of Music. He participated in many concerts over this period and in 1873 he founded the Oratorio Society of New York. The first concert of this society was later that year and consisted of a programme of works by Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Friedrich Handel, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and others. In 1874 Damrosch gave another concert at the Oratorio Society, this the first with a full orchestra, consisting of Handel's Samson. For Christmas that year Messiah was performed. Portrait drawing of Leopold Damrosch In 1876, Damrosch succeeded Carl Bergmann at the helm of the New York Philharmonic, but his high-minded programming - e.g. the entire first act of Wagner's Die Walk√ºre - frightened the typical New York subscriber, so his tenure with the orchestra was over. In 1877 Damrosch, in connection with a number of persons interested in the cultivation of orchestral music, established the Symphony society. This society became closely identified with the Oratorio Society and several joint performances were organized. The co- operation of these societies reached its climax in the great \\"musical festival\\" which was held in the armory of the 7th regiment in New York, from 3 till 7 May 1881. The chorus numbered 1,200, the main body being the Oratorio Society, which was augmented by various choral societies from neighboring towns. An additional chorus of 1,000 young ladies from the Normal College and 250 boys from the Church choirs took part in the afternoon concerts. The orchestra was composed of 250 pieces, and Dr. Damrosch selected a large number of artists for soloists. Among the choral works performed were Handel's Dettingen Te Deum and Messiah; Rubinstein's Tower of Babel (first time); Berlioz's Grande Messe des Mortes (first time); and Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The audience numbered from 8,000 to 10,000 at each concert, and the enthusiasm for the projector of this enterprise resulted in an ovation on the last night. The degree of Doctor of Music was conferred upon him by Columbia in 1880. Woodlawn Cemetery In 1883, Damrosch traveled extensively through the west with his orchestra. In September 1884, he began a remarkable series of operatic performances as General Manager and chief conductor of the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The company had experienced great financial losses during its first season of Italian opera under director Henry Abbey. For its second season it turned to Damrosch to direct the company in German repertory. The company comprised some of the greatest artists of the German opera houses, and, in contrast with the hitherto prevailing mode, every part, even the smallest, was carefully presented. Twelve of the operas performed were comparative novelties, the most important of which were Wagner's Tannh√§user, Lohengrin, and Die Walk√ºre, and Beethoven's Fidelio. This proved to be Damrosch's last effort. He conducted every performance except during the last week of his life, when he took a severe cold, from which he never recovered. He died in New York City in 1885. Damrosch was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.  Family  His sons Frank Damrosch and Walter Johannes Damrosch, both born in Breslau, in 1859 and 1862 respectively, both succeeded him as conductors of the Oratorio Society of New York. His daughter, Clara Mannes, was a music teacher. His grandchildren were musician Leopold Mannes and writer Marya Mannes.

Reproductive development The genus Monodelphis is marsupial; they are born under- developed and then mature further in the mother's pouch. In Monodelphis, the young first come off the teat in 12 days, whereas this occurs at 48 days in the related genus Didelphis. Most of the events in this process occur about 2‚Äì4 weeks later in Didelphis than in Monodelphis. This may be related to the shorter longevity of the species of Monodelphis compared to other marsupials who nurse for a longer period.Smith, K.K., \\"Comparative Rates of Development in Monodelphis and Didelphis‚Äù, Science, 31 January 1997: 275 no. 5300 pp. 683-684 DOI: 10.1126/science.275.5300.683.

Before that, he was the Editor-in-Chief of The Globe and Mail newspaper, based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada for seven years. In 2002, he assumed the position at a turning point in the paper's history, and, during his tenure, he instituted several sectional revamps, launched new web sites and maintained circulation levels. On May 25, 2009, he was replaced by John Stackhouse. Greenspon is a former managing editor of the Globe's Report on Business Section and was the Globe's Ottawa bureau chief before becoming editor-in-chief. He was the founding editor of Globeandmail.com. He is the father of three children: Bailey, Joshua and Jacob.  Early life  Greenspon was born in Montreal, Quebec on March 26, 1957. His father, Mortimer Greenspon, was an insurance agent and financial planner, while his mother, Rosalie, was a teacher. Edward Greenspon's first job was as a paperboy for the now defunct Montreal Star. Greenspon's interest in journalism began as the Watergate scandal broke. Inspired by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, he chose to go to Ottawa and study journalism and political science at Carleton University.  Education  Greenspon began his journalism career at Carleton University. While living on campus he worked for the residence newspaper, The Resin. Greenspon broke a story of corruption with the residence student government. He exposed student officials who misappropriated student fees to buy champagne, lobsters, and cigars. The story was soon picked up by the Ottawa Citizen. Later, the disgraced treasurer was denied a job at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) after a background check revealed the article in the Citizen. Greenspon graduated from Carleton in 1979 with honours. He earned an M.Sc. at the London School of Economics after winning a Commonwealth Scholarship. He is the co-author of two books and winner of the Hyman Solomon Prize for public policy writing. After stints with papers in Western Canada, Greenspon went on to study with the assistance of a Commonwealth Scholarship at the London School of Economics in England. He received his masters degree in politics and government in 1985.  The Globe and Mail  Greenspon began working at The Globe and Mail in 1986 as a reporter for the paper's Report on Business section. He soon found himself back in London as the Globe's first European business correspondent. With the collapse of communism, he and his colleagues in the London bureau spent most of the 1989 to 1991 period in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. In 1991, Greenspon returned to Canada and became the managing editor of the Report on Business section and then deputy managing editor of the newspaper. Following his lifelong fascination with politics, Greenspon became the Ottawa bureau chief and associate editor of the paper in 1993, a position he held for more than six years. In 1996, Greenspon partnered with Anthony Wilson-Smith to write the well-received book Double Vision. The work is a thorough analysis of the first three years, from 1993‚Äì1996, of the Liberal government led by Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien and Finance Minister Paul Martin and received the Douglas Purvis Prize for excellence in public policy writing. In 1999, at the height of a newspaper war in Canada, Greenspon was asked to commute to Toronto to manage the newsroom in the capacity of executive news editor. During this period, he became the founding editor for the Globe's internet site, www.theglobeandmail.com, and encouraged the paper to heavily invest in the soon to be very important internet news market. In late 2000, he returned to Ottawa as political editor and columnist in time for his third national election campaign and co-wrote a second book called Searching for Certainty: Inside the New Canadian Mindset with pollster Darrell Bricker. Greenspon won the Hyman Solomon Award for his contributions to public policy writing. In 2002, Greenspon accepted a position as the new editor-in-chief of the Globe and moved to Toronto. As chief editor, Greenspon instituted several changes to the paper, including a revamped Report on Business section, more investigative journalism, expanded politics coverage, and a new Science and Technology page. In 2007, he led a major redesign of The Globe that introduced the Globe Life section, reportonbusiness.com and globesports.com, as well as placing a greater emphasis on investigative journalism and web-print integration. During his tenure, The Globe led every year in the number of National Newspaper Awards and won the Michener Award for Public Service Journalism in an unprecedented three out of four years for stories about the sponsorship scandal, foot-dragging over introduction of the anti-breast cancer drug, Herceptin, and Afghan detainees. He also locked horns with former Brian Mulroney in revealing secret cash payments the former Prime Minister had received from German-Canadian businessman, Karl-Heinz Schreiber. On May 25, 2009, Greenspon was fired as editor-in-chief by Globe publisher Phillip Crawley. The reasons why were never made clear. He was replaced by John Stackhouse. He subsequently headed up a 12-person panel for the Canadian International Council that produced a major report called 'Open Canada: A Global Positioning Strategy for a Networked Age' before joining Star Media Group in 2010.

Kraybill (born 1946) is an author, lecturer, and educator on Anabaptist faiths and living. Kraybill is widely recognized for his studies on Anabaptist groups, and is the foremost living expert on the Old Order Amish. Kraybill is Distinguished College Professor, and Senior Fellow at the Young Center for Anabaptist and Pietist Studies at Elizabethtown College in Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania. He previously served as chair of the Sociology and Social Work Department at Elizabethtown from 1979 to 1985 and as director of the Young Center from 1989 to 1996. He was provost of Messiah College (PA) from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Elizabethtown College in 2003. Current and recent projects In October 2005, Young Center was awarded a $100,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a three-year collaborative research project entitled \\"Amish Diversity and Identity: Transformations in 20th Century America.\\" In addition to Kraybill as senior investigator, the investigative team includes Steven Nolt, Professor of History at Goshen College in Indiana, and Karen Johnson-Weiner, Professor of Anthropology at the State University of New York at Potsdam. A national panel of seven scholars advised the research team throughout the project. The NEH grant enabled the researchers to investigate the Amish experience at the national level, giving attention to geographic expansion, the growth of diversity, changing conceptions of identity and evolving patterns of interaction with the larger society. The team also explored how the Amish have contributed to shaping the identity of a nation that made exceptions in the areas of education, Social Security, and child labor for a religious minority living on its cultural margins. The project resulted in a website (http://www2.etown.edu/amishstudies/); an international conference, The Amish in America: New Identities and Diversities, held in 2007; and a book, The Amish. Recent book projects include Amish Grace: How Forgiveness Transcended Tragedy (Jossey-Bass, 2007), a discussion of the Amish response to the school shooting at Nickel Mines, and The Amish Way: Patient Faith in a Perilous World (Jossey-Bass, 2010), an exploration of Amish spiritual life and practices, both with coauthors Steven M. Nolt and David L. Weaver-Zercher. Kraybill also authored Concise Encyclopedia of Amish, Brethren, Hutterites, and Mennonites (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2010), which provides basic information about these four Anabaptist groups in North America, and coauthored (with Karen M. Johhson-Weiner and Steven M. Nolt) The Amish, a comprehensive description and analysis of Amish life and culture. Kraybill's most recent work has been related to five beard-cutting attacks on Amish people in eastern Ohio in the fall of 2011, which led to the arrests of sixteen members of a maverick Amish community in Bergholz, Ohio. Kraybill assisted federal prosecutors in understanding Amish beliefs and practices and served as an expert witness at the federal trial in 2012. He wrote a book about the attacks, investigation, trial, and aftermath: Renegade Amish: Beard Cutting, Hate Crimes, and the Trial of the Bergholz Barbers. In August 2014, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the hate crimes convictions, a ruling that generated much response. Kraybill was selected to research and write a centennial history of Eastern Mennonite University, his alma mater, that was published in 2017. Educator and author Kraybill is the author or editor of more than 18 books and dozens of professional articles and popular articles. His books have been translated into six different languages and his research on Anabaptist groups has been featured in magazines and newspapers, and on radio and television programs across the United States and in many foreign countries. Kraybill writes almost exclusively on the groups within the Anabaptist faith such as the Mennonites, Amish, and Bruderhof. In addition to academic books ‚Äî largely published by Johns Hopkins University Press ‚Äî he also writes popular books sold in gift shops to tourists, interested in learning more about the plain sects. He is one of two experts ‚Äî the other being D. Holmes Morton ‚Äî frequently quoted by reporters to give background to news stories involving the Amish.

New Kilpatrick, (also known as East Kilpatrick or Easter Kilpatrick) is an ecclesiastical Parish and former Civil Parish in Dunbartonshire. It was formed in 1649 from the eastern half of the parish of Kilpatrick (also known as Kirkpatrick), the western half forming Old Kilpatrick. New Kilpatrick is also a disused name for the town of Bearsden. Originally spanning a large area from Strathblane in the North to Baldernock and Summerston (on the River Kelvin) in the East, down to Anniesland in the South and Yoker and Duntocher in the West, a quarter of the parish was once in the county of Stirlingshire. The geography of the area has supported mining, iron-working and quarrying in the past, but these are no longer economically viable, and much of the area functions as suburbs of Glasgow. Local government of the area was once the responsibility of the kirk, but is now administered by East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow and Stirlingshire councils. The name New Kilpatrick was dropped from general civil use in 1958 when Bearsden Burgh was formed. The previous extent of New Kilpatrick can be seen quite clearly on old maps, but current maps no longer show the former parish. As the population of the area grew, the ecclesiastical parish reduced in area as smaller parishes were separated off and the parish now covers only a fraction of the town of Bearsden. The parish church was built in 1649 from local stone, and was replaced in 1807 with a larger building. History Former New Kilpatrick Parish Council Chambers, Bearsden, now in private ownership. The parish system was introduced to Scotland in the 13th century. In about 1227, the church and lands of Kilpatrick were given to Paisley Abbey by Maldowen, Earl of Lennox. The name Kilpatrick is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic Cille Ph√†draig - literally \\"Patrick's Churchyard\\". The alternative anglicised form \\"Kirkpatrick\\" is occasionally used in old texts. It is therefore reasonable to assume that a church dedicated to St Patrick gave the area its name before the transfer to Paisley Abbey. The parish remained under the supervision of the Abbey until the Reformation in 1560. At the Dissolution, the Church property fell into the possession of Lord Sempill. Eventually the lands were conferred on Lord Claud Hamilton (a boy of ten), ancestor of the Dukes of Abercorn. His son James Hamilton was created Lord Abercorn on 5 April 1603, then on 10 July 1606 he was made Earl of Abercorn and Lord of Paisley, Hamilton, Mountcastell and Kilpatrick.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al (St Andrews University) Date accessed: 5 July 2010 Kilpatrick was split into two parishes - Old (Wester or West) and New (Easter or East) by an Act of Parliament on 16 February 1649.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al (St Andrews University) Date accessed: 13 September 2011 This division is of note because this was a split of both the ecclesiastical and civil parishes and the wealth and stipend of the original parish was shared between the two new parishes. It was more common for new parishes to have \\"daughter\\" status, with wealth retained by the central, or cathedral church. Since 1649 a succession of parishes have been separated from the original, with Drumchapel, Knightswood and Temple now within the City of Glasgow, while Milngavie and Baldernock lie in Dunbartonshire and Strathblane in Stirlingshire, and Drumry is considered part of Clydebank. Local government Former Temple Primary School, built by New Kilpatrick School Board with local stone from Netherton For many years, the civil and ecclesiastical functions of the parish overlapped. For example, the kirk session dealt with minor misdemeanors, such as a man from Kirkton (New Kirk) fined for \\"swearing wickedly and doing actual violence to his mother\\" in 1701. Other offences included the hanging out of laundry on the Lord's Day and many instances of infidelity. One of the penalties that could be applied was the Stool of Repentance where individuals could be publicly shamed. This was originally situated in a corner of the church building but in 1694, it was moved to below the pulpit to increase its prominence. The church session was also assigned the duty of care for the poor, and in 1672, part of this duty was transferred to the heritors of the parish. These wealthy landowners made a list of the poor and shared them out amongst themselves. The care shown to the poor included the provision of accommodation and maintenance, and any failure of the better-off to provide these could have led to legal proceedings against them. In 1845, the relief of poverty was transferred to the Parochial Board, although the kirk continued to provide assistance on a case-by-case basis. Until 1872, the provision of education had been the responsibility of the kirk session, but this was transferred to a School Board (from 1873 to 1919) for building and running schools in the area. Temple Primary School (1901‚Äì2007) now in Glasgow, is an example (see photo). In 1895, the Parochial Board became the Parish Council, which had responsibility for town planning and housing, lighting, drainage. In 1930, the word \\"parish\\" was dropped, and New Kilpatrick became a District Council.East Dunbartonshire Official Records Archive Date accessed: 19 April 2010 The boundaries of the civil parish were modified by the formation of Milngavie Burgh in 1875, the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889 and the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929.The Gazetteer for Scotland Date accessed: 19 April 2010 The district council was dissolved in 1958 on creation of Bearsden Burgh, which was itself dissolved in 1975. Control then passed to Bearsden and Milngavie district within Strathclyde Regional Council until 1996. The local government of the original parish area is now administered by East Dunbartonshire, Glasgow and Stirlingshire Councils.East Dunbartonshire Council Date accessed: 4 May 2010 Economy and geography In 1672, the Scottish Parliament heard a petition from John Douglas of Mains to hold markets in the parish on 1 May and 21 October each year. The purpose of this was to encourage the local economy, and the bill was passed.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al (St Andrews University) Date accessed: 5 July 2010. John Douglas was a heritor of the parish and was the 11th Laird of Mains, registering his coat of arms in 1672.Douglas Family History Date accessed: 19 July 2010. The geology of the area runs east‚Äìwest through the parish from Dunbarton to Maryhill and has supported various industries. Devonian Old Red Sandstone (415‚Äì360 million years old) is overlaid by the Carboniferous Limestone series (360‚Äì300 million years old); in particular, the Hurlet Limestone and Hurlet Coal of the lower limestone group are prominently developed. A yellow sandstone of quite different character from the Old Red Sandstone extends from the Clyde at intervals to Netherton and Garscube. This stone easily chiselled, but hardens on exposure, making it a useful building material.Gazetteer for Scotland Date accessed: 3 June 2010 Local industry has historically included some coal- mining and lime manufacture, and an iron works at Garscube. Coal was mined at Baljaffray until 1910 and used for burning limestone (also found there) to make lime. However, the presence of significant pyrite deposits in the coal made it poor quality and unsuitable for further exploitation. By 1911, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica described New Kilpatrick as a town in Dumbartonshire, N.W. of Glasgow, with a railway station on the Milngavie branch line. Key public buildings are listed as the Schaw Convalescent Home, Buchanan Retreat (now Boclair House), house of refuge for girls, a library, and St Peter's College. Current church and related parish New Kilpatrick Cemetery, Bearsden The original parish church was built in 1649 from local stone. This can be confirmed by the passing of an Act of the Scottish Parliament (in July 1649) in favour of the parishioners of New Kilpatrick and against one of the parish heritors, Sir Umphra Colquhoun of Balvie (now Mains). It seems that Colquhoun had agreed to the quarrying of stone from his land to build the church, but at some point during the building process (at least halfway), he had confiscated the workmen's tools and prevented the work from continuing by charging the workers with lawburrows. For this to be the case, Colquhoun must have argued that the work in some way caused him to fear for his safety, and the workers would have had to place a deposit with the court, which would be forfeited if they continued. Colquhoun lost the petition, and the church was completed.The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al (St Andrews University) Date accessed: 5 July 2010 The current New Kilpatrick Church was built in 1807, and subsequently enlarged in 1873‚Äì85 and in 1908. Electric lights were installed in 1923. The church for many years placed assistant ministers within the parish at Netherton and Temple, Blairdardie, Drumchapel and Westerton. The church is also one of the principal performing venues of the Bearsden Choir. In 1929, further housing developments and the union of churches in Scotland brought together the growing congregations of Beardsen North (Free Church) and South (United Presbyterian) churches into the Church of Scotland in Bearsden. It was therefore deemed appropriate to divide the remaining parish area, leaving the original New Kilpatrick church with oversight of an area with boundaries at Canniesburn, Burnbrae and the Baljaffray-Stockiemuir crossroads.

He was the pilot of Space Shuttle Atlantis on his first mission to space, STS-115, which launched on September 9, 2006 and returned to Earth on September 21, 2006. He then commanded STS-126 aboard . In 2011, he was assigned as commander of STS-135, which was the final mission of the space shuttle program. On December 9, 2011, he retired from NASA and became director of Crew and Mission Operations for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. In August 2018, Ferguson was assigned to the first test flight of the Boeing CST-100 Starliner, although he stepped down from the mission in October 2020. Education Ferguson was born September 1, 1961, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He attended Archbishop Ryan High School, from which he graduated in 1979. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Drexel University in 1984, and earned his Master of Science degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate School in 1991. Military career Ferguson was commissioned from the Navy ROTC program at the University of Pennsylvania. He received his Naval Aviator wings in NAS Kingsville, Texas in 1986 and was ordered to the F-14 Tomcat training squadron in Virginia Beach, Virginia. After a brief period of instruction, he joined the 'Red Rippers' of VF-11 deploying to the North Atlantic, Mediterranean and Indian Ocean on board the aircraft carrier . While with VF-11, he also attended the Navy Fighter Weapons School (TOPGUN). He was selected for the United States Naval Test Pilot School program in 1989 and graduated in 1992. Through June 1994 he was assigned to the Weapons Branch of the Strike Aircraft Test Directorate at the Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland where he served as the project officer for the F-14D weapon separation program, becoming the first pilot to release several types of air-to-ground weapons from the Tomcat. He served one year as an instructor at the Naval Test Pilot School before joining the 'Checkmates' of VF-211 in 1995 and completing a deployment to the Western Pacific and Persian Gulf in defense of the Iraqi no- fly zone on board . He briefly served as an F-14 logistics officer for the Atlantic Fleet prior to his selection to the space program. NASA career Ferguson was selected for astronaut training in 1998 and completed training as a pilot. Ferguson was the deputy chief of the astronaut office prior to his selection to the STS-135 crew and served as CAPCOM for the STS-118, STS-128, and STS-129 missions. Ferguson as CAPCOM for STS-129 =STS-115= Ferguson made his first space flight as pilot of STS-115 in 2006. The mission delivered the second port-side truss segment (ITS P3/P4), a pair of solar arrays (2A and 4A), and batteries to the International Space Station. A total of three spacewalks were performed, during which the crew connected the systems on the installed trusses, prepared them for deployment, and did other maintenance work on the station. He returned to Earth after over 11 days on orbit. =STS-126= Ferguson signing the STS-126 patch on the ISS Ferguson returned to space for the second time, as Commander of STS-126 in 2008. The purpose of the mission, referred to as ULF2 by the ISS program, was to deliver equipment and supplies to the station, to service the Solar Alpha Rotary Joints (SARJ), and repair the problem in the starboard SARJ that had limited its use since STS-120. He returned to Earth after almost 16 days on orbit. =STS-135= Ferguson pictured onboard the ISS during STS-135 Ferguson made his third and last flight as a NASA astronaut, Commanding STS-135, the final mission of the Space Shuttle. The mission's primary cargo was the Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Raffaello and a Lightweight Multi-Purpose Carrier (LMC), which were delivered to the International Space Station (ISS). The flight of Raffaello marked the only time that Atlantis carried an MPLM. He returned to Earth after 12 days in space. Post-NASA career Ferguson retired from NASA in 2011. He currently works for Boeing as director of Crew and Mission Operations for Boeing's Commercial Crew Program. =Boe-CFT= Ferguson (centre) as part of the Boe-CFT crew In July 2018, Boeing announced his assignment to the first human CST-100 orbital test known as Boe-CFT.

Early life and education Higginbotham was born in Chicago, Illinois, and attended Whitney Young Magnet High School, graduating in 1982. She received a Bachelor of Science degree from the Southern Illinois University Carbondale in 1987, and a Masters of Management Science (1992) and Masters in Space Systems (1996) both from the Florida Institute of Technology. Higginbotham is a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority and The Links, Incorporated. Career =NASA= Sunita L. Williams (Expedition 14 flight engineer) refer to a procedures checklist as they work the controls of the Canadarm2 in the International Space Station's Destiny laboratory during flight day four of STS-116. Higginbotham began her career in 1987, two weeks after getting her Bachelor of Science degree, at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida, as a Payload Electrical Engineer in the Electrical and Telecommunications Systems Division. Within six months she became the lead for the Orbiter Experiments (OEX) on OV-102, the Space Shuttle Columbia. She later worked on the Shuttle payload bay reconfiguration for all Shuttle missions and conducted electrical compatibility tests for all payloads flown aboard the Shuttle. She was also tasked by KSC management to undertake several special assignments where she served as the Executive Staff Assistant to the Director of Shuttle Operations and Management, led a team of engineers in performing critical analysis for the Space Shuttle flow in support of a simulation model tool, and worked on an interactive display detailing the Space Shuttle processing procedures at Spaceport United States (Kennedy Space Center's Visitors Center). Higginbotham then served as backup orbiter project engineer for OV-104, Space Shuttle Atlantis, where she participated in the integration of the orbiter docking station (ODS) into the space shuttle used during Shuttle/Mir docking missions. Two years later, she was promoted to lead orbiter project engineer for OV-102, Space Shuttle Columbia. In this position, she held the technical lead government engineering position in the firing room where she supported and managed the integration of vehicle testing and troubleshooting. She actively participated in 53 space shuttle launches during her 9-year tenure at Kennedy Space Center. Selected as an astronaut candidate by NASA in April 1996, Higginbotham reported to the Johnson Space Center in August 1996. Since that time, she had been assigned technical duties in the Payloads & Habitability Branch, the Shuttle Avionics & Integration Laboratory (SAIL), the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) Operations (Ops) Support Branch, where she tested various modules of the International Space Station for operability, compatibility, and functionality prior to launch, the Astronaut Office CAPCOM (Capsule Communicator) Branch in the startup and support of numerous space station missions and space shuttle missions, the Robotics Branch, and Lead for the International Space Station Systems Crew Interfaces Section. Higginbotham logged over 308 hours in space during her mission with the crew of STS-116 where her primary task was to operate the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). Higginbotham took a scarf for the Houston Dynamo on board with her during her mission. Higginbotham was originally assigned to the crew of STS-126 targeted for launch in September 2008. On November 21, 2007, NASA announced a change in the crew manifest, due to Higginbotham's decision to leave NASA to take a job in the private sector. Donald Pettit replaced Higginbotham for STS-126.

Crystal structure of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel total synthesis in organic chemistry is a major ongoing research effort in the total synthesis of paclitaxel (Taxol).Note that the original publications about the total synthesis use the name \\"taxol\\", which used to be the generic name before it was accepted as a trademark in 1992. This diterpenoid is an important drug in the treatment of cancer but, also expensive because the compound is harvested from a scarce resource, namely the Pacific yew (Taxus brevifolia). Not only is the synthetic reproduction of the compound itself of great commercial and scientific importance, but it also opens the way to paclitaxel derivatives not found in nature but with greater potential. The paclitaxel molecule consists of a tetracyclic core called baccatin III and an amide tail. The core rings are conveniently called (from left to right) ring A (a cyclohexene), ring B (a cyclooctane), ring C (a cyclohexane) and ring D (an oxetane). The paclitaxel drug development process took over 40 years. The anti-tumor activity of a bark extract of the Pacific yew tree was discovered in 1963 as a follow up of a US government plant screening program already in existence 20 years before that. The active substance responsible for the anti- tumor activity was discovered in 1969 and structure elucidation was completed in 1971. Robert A. Holton of Florida State University succeeded in the total synthesis of paclitaxel in 1994, a project that he had started in 1982. In 1989 Holton had also developed a semisynthetic route to paclitaxel starting from 10-deacetylbaccatin III. This compound is a biosynthetic precursor and is found in larger quantities than paclitaxel itself in Taxus baccata (the European Yew). In 1990 Bristol-Myers Squibb bought a licence to the patent for this process which in the years to follow earned Florida State University and Holton (with a 40% take) over 200 million US dollars.  Total synthesis Taxol numbering scheme Taxol synthesis routes showing the precursors used by each of them. The total synthesis of taxol is called one of the most hotly contested of the 1990s Nina Hall (2003) \\"Creating complexity ‚Äì the beauty and logic of synthesis\\" Chem. Commun. 2003 (6), 661-664. with around 30 competing research groups by 1992. The number of research groups actually having reported a total synthesis currently stands at 10 with the Holton group (article first accepted for publication) and the Nicolaou group (article first published) first and second in what is called a photo finish. Some of the efforts are truly synthetic but in others a precursor molecule found in nature is included. The key data are collected below. What all strategies have in common is synthesis of the baccatin molecule followed by last stage addition of the tail, a process (except for one) based on the Ojima lactam. # Holton Taxol total synthesis - year: 1994 - precursor: Patchoulol - strategy: linear synthesis AB then C then D - references: see related article # Nicolaou Taxol total synthesis - year: 1994 - precursor: Mucic acid strategy: convergent synthesis A and C merge to ABC then D - references: see related article # Danishefsky Taxol total synthesis - year: 1996 - precursor: Wieland-Miescher ketone strategy: convergent synthesis C merges with D then with A merges to ABCD - references: See related article # Wender Taxol total synthesis - year: 1997 - precursor: Pinene strategy: linear synthesis AB then C then D - references:Paul A.

These derivatives have the same skeleton as paclitaxel except for the organic residue R of the terminal tail amide group which can be phenyl, or propyl or pentyl (among others) whereas in paclitaxel it is an explicit phenyl group. The semisynthesis consists of conversion of the amide group to an amine with Schwartz's reagent through an imine followed by acidic workup and a benzoylation. :Taxol Semi Synthesis Taxanes In the production process Michigan grown yews which mature in 8 years are periodically topped and dried.

Paclitaxel biosynthesis. OPP stands for pyrophosphate. The biosynthetic pathway to paclitaxel has been investigated and consists of approximately 20 enzymatic steps. The complete scheme is still unavailable. The segments that are known are very different from the synthetic pathways tried thus far (Scheme 1). The starting compound is geranylgeranyl diphosphate 2 MyDoanh Chau, Stefan Jennewein, Kevin Walker, and Rodney Croteau (2004) Taxol Biosynthesis: Molecular Cloning and Characterization of a Cytochrome P450 Taxoid 7Œ≤-Hydroxylase Chemistry & Biology, 11 (5), 663-672, which is a dimer of geraniol 1. This compound already contains all the required 20 carbon atoms for the paclitaxel skeleton. More ring closing through intermediate 3 (taxadiene) leads to taxusin 4. The two main reasons why this type of synthesis is not feasible in the laboratory is that nature does a much better job controlling stereochemistry and a much better job activating a hydrocarbon skeleton with oxygen substituents for which cytochrome P450 is responsible in some of the oxygenations. Intermediate 5 is called 10-deacetylbaccatin III. A biochemical kilogram-scale production of taxadiene was reported using genetically engineered E. coli in 2011.

He has logged over 4,250 flight hours in more than 30 different aircraft. Archambault is married with three children. His hobbies include bicycling, weightlifting, and playing ice hockey. Archambault has received numerous awards and honors throughout his life. He has also flown two Space Shuttle missions, as pilot of STS-117 in 2007 and as commander of STS-119 in 2009. Archambault left NASA in 2013 after a 15-year career with the agency in order to become a test pilot for Sierra Nevada Corporation on their Dream Chaser orbital spaceplane project. Education Archambault attended Proviso West High School, Hillside, Illinois, in 1978. Upon graduating from high school, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign where he earned Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering in 1982 and 1984, respectively. Military career Archambault received a commission of Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force from the Air Force Officer Training School at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, in January 1985. Upon completion, he attended the Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training (ENJJPT) Program at Sheppard Air Force Base, Texas, and earned his pilot wings in April 1986. He then reported to Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico, where he served as a combat ready F-111D pilot in the 27th Tactical Fighter Wing until April 1990. In May 1990, he transitioned to the F-117A in the 37th Tactical Fighter Wing at Nellis Air Force Base/Tonopah Test Range, Nevada. From November 1990 to April 1991, he deployed to Saudi Arabia in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm and flew twenty-two combat missions in the F-117A during the Gulf War. He served a second F-117A tour in Saudi Arabia from August 1991 to December 1991 in support of post-Desert Storm peacekeeping efforts. In August 1992, Archambault was reassigned to Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, where he served as an F-117A instructor pilot and operational test pilot for the 57th Wing. Archambault attended the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, from July 1994 until June 1995. In July 1995, he was assigned to the 46th Test Wing at the Air Force Development Test Center, Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. There, he performed weapons developmental flight tests in all models of the F-16. Archambault was the assistant operations officer for the 39th Flight Test Squadron when he was selected for the astronaut program. Archambault is a Colonel in the U.S. Air Force. Awards and honors Archambault has received many awards and honors, including the Distinguished Flying Cross, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal (2nd Oak Leaf Cluster), Air Medal (2nd Oak Leaf Cluster), Aerial Achievement Medal (4th Oak Leaf Cluster), Air Force Commendation Medal (1st Oak Leaf Cluster), Air Force Achievement Medal, Combat Readiness Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Kuwait Liberation Medal, and various other service awards. He is a Distinguished Graduate and Liethen-Tittle Award recipient (top graduate) from the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School, and a Distinguished Graduate from the U.S. Air Force Officer Training School.

NASA career Lee Archambault at the Canada Arm 2 controls on ISS during STS-117 Lee Archambault going over a check list on the shuttle flight deck during STS-119 In June 1998, Archambault was selected as an Astronaut Candidate by NASA, and he reported for training in August 1998. In June 1999, Archambault was assigned to the Astronaut Office Shuttle Operations Branch, where he worked on flight instrument upgrades that were incorporated into the Shuttle in 2003. In September 2001, Archambault was also assigned within the Shuttle Branch to serve as an Astronaut Support Person. In this role, Archambault supported launch and landing operations at the Kennedy Space Center, and was the lead in this role for STS-111 and STS-114. Beginning in October 2004, he picked up duties as a CAPCOM and served in this role during daily orbit shifts for STS-121. =STS-117= Archambault was the pilot for STS-117, which was the 118th mission of the Space Shuttle program. STS-117 launched on 8 June 2007 at 19:38 EDT and landed on 22 June 2007 at 15:49 EDT. The 14-day mission traveled 5.8 million miles and landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California. The mission delivered the S3/S4 truss segment to the International Space Station and swapped a long duration crew member. =STS-119= STS-119 was Archambault's first mission as commander of a Space Shuttle. The mission delivered the final set of solar arrays to the space station, as well as long duration crew member Koichi Wakata. STS-119 was a 13-day mission which was launched on 15 March 2009, and landed at 19:43 EDT. The mission landed on 28 March 2009 at 15:13 EDT and traveled 5.3 million miles and landed at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. =Dream Chaser= On March 19, 2013, NASA announced that Archambault was leaving the agency after 15 years in order to join Sierra Nevada Corporation. Archambault will work on Sierra Nevada's Dream Chaser lifting-body spaceplane, which is being developed under NASA's Commercial Crew Development program as a potential vehicle for future crewed and uncrewed cargo missions to the International Space Station. Like the Space Shuttle, which Archambault has previously flown, Dream Chaser is designed to launch vertically and land horizontally on a runway. Unpowered drop tests of a Dream Chaser test article are planned at Edwards Air Force Base, where Archambault previously landed the Space Shuttle at the end of STS-117. =DeHavilland Dash 8 Turboprop= In early March 2019, Archambault obtained his type rating in the Bombardier Dash 8, previously known as the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 or DHC-8, a series of twin-engine, medium-range, turboprop airliners. Archambault currently flies the Dash 8 part-time.

Melbourne Observatory Building & Astrograph House Melbourne Observatory was founded in 1862 to serve as a scientific research institution for the rapidly growing city of Melbourne, the capital of the colony of Victoria. The observatory was tasked by the Victorian government with maintaining an accurate time reference for the colony through observations of stars using a transit telescope as well as general astronomical research. The idea for a Melbourne Observatory was first proposed by English astronomer William Parkinson Wilson in a paper read before The Philosophical Institute of Victoria in 1856; and soon after a committee was formed to \\"achieve Wilson's 'noble object'\\".Wilson, William Parkinson (1826‚Äì1874) Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 6, 1976 The site chosen was a gentle hill adjacent to the Royal Botanic Gardens. Shortly after founding a telescope was installed at the observatory for astronomical research and for a while it was the largest fully steerable telescope in the world. This instrument was referred to as the \\"Great Melbourne Telescope\\". In 1874 the observatory took part in the worldwide effort to observe the Transit of Venus in order to better determine the distance of Earth to the Sun. Towards the end of the 1880s the observatory took part in the international \\"Carte du Ciel\\" project to map the heavens using the, then novel, technique of photography. Being the most southerly of the sites taking part, Melbourne was assigned the region around the south celestial pole south of declination -65¬∞. With the coming of federation in 1901 the Commonwealth government was assigned the responsibility for astronomy and time-keeping and control of the observatory was gradually handed over by the state government. At the same time, the encroaching light pollution from the growing city of Melbourne gradually made quality astronomical observations increasingly difficult. Then, in 1933 the flood-lit Shrine of Remembrance was completed in the parkland adjacent to the observatory impacting its skies further, until the observatory was finally closed in 1945. Most of the scientific equipment and instruments, including the Great Melbourne Telescope, were sold or moved elsewhere. Today, while most of the original buildings still stand on the site, only two of the original instruments remain. Both were installed in 1874 to observe the transit of Venus. One is an refracting telescope by Troughton and Simms of London, and the other is a fully restored Photoheliograph by Dallmeyer of London. The Photoheliograph is privately owned and on indefinite loan to the Astronomical Society of Victoria. The building which was used by the astrograph telescope for the \\"Carte du Ciel\\" survey now houses a Newtonian reflector telescope owned by the Astronomical Society of Victoria. The Great Melbourne Telescope was eventually moved to the Mount Stromlo Observatory where it was badly damaged in the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and a project is underway to restore the telescope to working order so that it may be used for educational and public viewing in its original home at the Melbourne Observatory. This is a joint undertaking of Museum Victoria, the Astronomical Society of Victoria and the Royal Botanic Gardens. The restoration project will incorporate bringing the telescope's optical, mechanical and electrical systems into line with current best practice. After more than five years weighing up different proposals, engineering work commenced in late 2013 thanks to a $70,000 grant from the Copland Foundation.

Located on the Bay of Fundy, Margaretsville was named for Margaret Inglis by her husband the Honourable Brenton Halliburton, 8th Chief Justice of Nova Scotia. Margaret was the daughter of Bishop Inglis, the first Anglican Bishop of Nova Scotia. When they married her father gave them an estate on the shore which included all the area around where present day Margaretsville sets. This estate sat next to Sir Brenton's father's estate. The Halliburtons had built their summer home in the area in 1802. Over the years there have been approx. 15 general stores in and around the community of which none now exist. During World War I, Margaretsville had the distinction of setting a record in Nova Scotia by having over 10% of its population enlist for military service and being second in all of Canada. In 1946, Margaretsville was honored by having a lady in the community with the longest name in Canada: Mrs. Harriett Belle Franklyn Laura Victoria Adeline Drake Gibson. In a local newspaper dated May 1901, it was stated that a building was sold, in which Mr. Moody of Margaretsville, built the sailing ship Spray in which Capt. Joshua Slocum made his famous solo voyage around the world. A busy port during the early 1900s, Margaretsville is now a placid seaside community favored by tourists, artists and retirees. There is a small local art gallery owned by the Artist's Circle (Greenwood, Nova Scotia) which sells a variety of art from many local artists. It is called \\"The Art Shack\\" and there is always a member of the Artist's Circle on duty to sell art. There is also lively folk music scene. Some locals refer to the community as ‚ÄòMargaretville‚Äô (without an ‚Äòs‚Äô) and local road signs are/were inconsistent in their spelling of the name. The official spelling ‚ÄîMargaretsville (and neighboring East Margaretsville) with the ‚Äòs‚Äô‚Äîwas decided by Nova Scotia Geographical Names on April 5, 1951. An interesting piece of information concerning Margaretsville is the lighthouse which some say appears on the 1967, 5[¬¢] Canada, stamp. As all lighthouses are unique the picture on the stamp matches very closely the Margaretsville lighthouse.

The story is told from the point of view of the elderly Alice (now the widowed Mrs. Hargreaves) as she travels to the United States from England to receive an honorary degree from Columbia University celebrating the centenary of Lewis Carroll's birth. It shares common themes with Potter's television play Alice (1965). The film evolves from the factual to the hallucinatory as Alice revisits her memories of the Reverend Charles Dodgson (Holm), in Victorian-era Oxford to her immediate present in Depression-era New York. Accompanied by a shy young orphan named Lucy (Cowper), old Alice must make her way through the modern world of tabloid journalism and commercial exploitation while attempting to come to peace with her conflicted childhood with the Oxford don. Plot The film begins on the ship bearing Alice (Coral Browne) and Lucy from England to New York City. As she and Lucy (Nicola Cowper) disembark, they are set upon by several journalists, all trying to get a story or quote from her. Clearly bewildered by all the excitement, she is befriended by an ex- reporter, Jack Dolan (Peter Gallagher), who helps her and Lucy through the legions of the press. Dolan quickly becomes her agent and finds endorsement opportunities for her. Throughout it all, a romance develops between Jack and Lucy. Alice, being advanced in age, needs Lucy, of whom she can be very demanding, to be her constant companion. When left alone in their hotel room, she begins to hallucinate and sees Mr. Dodgson (Ian Holm) in their room, and then, later, the Mad Hatter (voiced by Tony Haygarth) and the March Hare (voiced by Ken Campbell). Joining them for their insane tea party, she is berated for being so old and forgetful. She remembers also the lazy boating party of 4 July 1862, when the young Reverend Charles Dodgson (Lecturer in Mathematics at Christ Church, Oxford, where her father was the Dean), had attempted to entertain her and her sisters by spinning the nonsense tale that grew to be Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Via flashbacks, it is insinuated that Dodgson had an infatuation with the young Alice Liddell (Amelia Shankley). Alice is troubled by her recollections of Dodgson. The parameters of her relationship with him were somewhat tortured. Dodgson was unwaveringly adoring of Alice, and while she was usually kind, she could sometimes be cruel and mocking of him, especially of his occasional stutter ‚Äì as on the day of the boating party when she was on the verge of her teens and trying to impress a couple of young students (one of whom she eventually marries). Alice tries to rectify her feelings and past relationship with the author in her mind. By the time she delivers her acceptance speech at Columbia University, she comes to terms with Dodgson and the way she treated him. In another fantasy sequence with the Mock Turtle, the viewers see them finally reconciled together in a way that can be interpreted as all-encompassing, as both mutual apology and forgiveness.

He decided to do it as a feature, but after unhappy experiences writing Pennies from Heaven and Gorky Park he did it through his own company and also worked as executive producer. He used the producer and director of his successful TV production, Cream in My Coffee. The film was part of a slate of movies greenlit by Verity Lambert at EMI Films. Others included Salyground, Morons from Outer Space, and Comfort and Joy. \\"EMI back with four feature films\\" - Peter Fiddick. The Guardian 16 Nov 1983: 2. There was no US money in the film but Universal had first right of refusal to distribute. Potter said the movie \\"was perilously close to an art film but I'm sick of films made for teeny tots or adults who never grew up.\\" and \\"It's alleged that when you repress things you know are doubtful, that's supposed to be harmful to you as a person, but great art can come out of discipline. Dodgson was a much more complex and heroic man than we think. I'm utterly convinced he never made any questionable physical contact with Alice, but he had what in these post-Freudian days would be called a sexual longing.\\" =Filming= Makeup and creature effects for the film were created by Jim Henson's Creature Shop. Six complexly detailed creatures, rather malformed, as they are in the book, were made. The Gryphon and the sorrowful Mock Turtle live among ledges of rock on a darkling seashore. The March Hare has broken yellowish teeth and soiled looking whiskers and he seems to be chewing even while he is speaking. He, the Mad Hatter, and the Dormouse, and the Caterpillar too, 'converse in the same matter of fact, egalitarian manner that the visiting Alice does.' The puppets were based on the original Tenniel drawings, although Potter wanted them interpreted towards the dark side. Puppet movement and choreography was developed by American actress and choreographer Gates McFadden. Due to a problem with work visas, McFadden was unable to receive full credit in this film. The Chinese costume sequence in the film depicting Dodgson taking Alice's portrait at Oxford is based on actual photographs he took of her and her sisters. Dodgson, an early pioneer of photography, was considered one of the world's first portrait photographers. Dennis Potter's use of pop entertainment of the 1930s in his works is present in this film. \\"I Only Have Eyes for You\\" is sung at a tea dance at the Waldorf Astoria and Mrs. Hargreaves has a scene at a radio station that includes a crooner's rendition of \\"Confessin'\\". The Depression- era setting of the film is in 1932, when Alice turned 80, two years before she died in 1934. Post-production According to director Gavin Millar, the film's producer, Verity Lambert, \\"never wanted the dean, Alice's father, to be [played by] Nigel Hawthorne,\\" actively but unsuccessfully opposing him cast in the role. Millar later recalled, that during the editing process, \\"every scene with Nigel in it, she was down on it like a ton of bricks. And she gradually cut him out and out and out of every scene,\\" so the director eventually had to edit out Hawthorne's part completely. The film's score was composed by Stanley Myers. Release The film received only a very limited release in a small number of 'art house' theatres mainly due to challenges by the film's distributors. In Britain, the film only played in one London cinema for a limited engagement. Disagreements and legal challenges between the film's production company, the distributors and the cinema chains in other unrelated matters caused the film to almost disappear without a trace. Browne came to London to promote the film and receive The London Evening Standard's Best Actress Award for the film, appearing on the TV chat show Wogan in an attempt to publicise the film, also taking out an ad in the entertainment journal Variety offering her performance 'for your consideration' in 'Oscar Season', all at her own cost.Price, Victoria. Vincent Price: A Daughter's Biography. St. Martin's Press 1999. Collis, Rose. Coral Browne: This Effing Lady. Oberon Books Ltd 2007. The film made the ten-best lists of many critics. By 1986 it sold $490,690 worth of tickets. In order to get Universal to release the film, EMI had to pay for the prints and all the advertising costs. Critical reception The film was reviewed favourably by the critic Pauline Kael who praised the performances. \\"Nothing I've seen Coral Browne do onscreen had prepared me for this performance. In the past she seemed too bullying a presence; she was too stiffly theatrical for the camera and her voice was a blaster. Here, as Mrs. Hargreaves, she has the capacity for wonder of the Alice of the stories, and when she's overtaken by frailty her voice is querulous and fading.\\" \\"The bright, poised, subtly flirty Alice at ten [is] played by Amelia Shankley, whose conversations with her sisters have an angelic precision. The sound of these imperious little-princess voices blended in idle chitchat is plangent, evocative. It makes you happy and makes you respond to the happiness of the Reverend Mr. Dodgson as he loiters outside the little girls' windows, eavesdropping.\\" \\"Ian Holm, who plays Dodgson, has to achieve almost all his effects passively, by registering the man's acute and agonizing self-consciousness and his furtive reactions to what goes on around him; it's all there in Holm's performance.\\" Andrew Sarris's review in The Village Voice was titled \\"the Film That Got Away.\\"\\"Lost and Found: Dreamchild\\", Sight & Sound, March 2014, Vol. 24, issue 3, p. 100 Sarris wrote that the film \\"gets infinitely better as it goes along, rising inexorably towards a rich epiphany\\" and resisting \\"facile irony\\". He wrote, \\"what makes the film so rousing and inspiring is its invocation of love and art as redemptive forces pitted against the dark spirits.\\" In an article published many years later, in 2014, in the film magazine Sight & Sound, Philip Horne expanded on the relative obscurity of Dreamchild and wrote that it \\"remains a film worth fighting for.\\" Lambert said it was one of the films of which she was most proud when she ran EMI.CV; VERITY LAMBERT Founder, Cinema Verity Lambert, Verity.

The EP features the entire recording of the band's first ever studio session on March 17, 1990 and also a twenty-page booklet focusing on the band's early career prior to the release of their debut studio album, Pretty on the Inside (1991). The EP marked Hole's final release on Sympathy for the Record Industry. Background Hole formed in mid-1989 after lead guitarist Eric Erlandson replied to an advertisement, placed by frontwoman Courtney Love, in the Los Angeles-based punk rock fanzine The Recycler. The band's first rehearsal took place in Fortress Studios in Hollywood, where Love, Erlandson and original bassist Lisa Roberts \\"played something noisy\\" while \\"they [Courtney and Lisa] started screaming their poetry at the top of their lungs for two or three hours.\\" Drummer Caroline Rue and a third guitarist, Mike Geisbrecht were then recruited and the band began performing shows in October 1989. Songs that would be later featured on The First Session were played at these series of live shows. Before Hole began to develop a fanbase, Geisbrecht left and was replaced briefly by Errol Stewart, who also left a few weeks later. Roberts also left the group at some point in early 1990 and was replaced by Jill Emery on bass. Recording In March 1990, Hole were given a budget of $500 by Sympathy for the Record Industry's president Long Gone John for a studio recording session, which was initially meant to include only \\"Retard Girl.\\"Mermis, John. \\"[He] gave the band 500 bucks for a recording session. She told me she wanted to do this song called 'Retard Girl' and that intrigued me.\\" Extract from an interview from Courtney Love: The E! True Hollywood Story, broadcast on October 5, 2003. The allocated studio was known as Rudy's Rising Star, which Hole later described as \\"a tiny LA basement studio,\\" and the recording session took place on March 17, 1990. \\"Turpentine\\" was recorded first, followed by \\"Phonebill Song\\" and \\"Retard Girl.\\" The final song, \\"Johnnie's in the Bathroom,\\" was an avant garde-inspired noise jam and included segments of recorded phonecalls. Love's then-husband, \\"Falling\\" James Moreland, recorded and produced the session and Erlandson also took part in the production process. The final recordings were mastered by John Vestman. Moreland, despite mixed reports, would not produce Hole's next session at Radio Tokyo in November 1990, which featured \\"Dicknail\\" and \\"Burn Black.\\" The following month, in April 1990, Sympathy for the Record Industry took three songs from the session and officially released them as Hole's debut single, \\"Retard Girl.\\" This release omitted \\"Turpentine.\\" Packaging The album's cover artwork features a black and white photograph of the band in 1990, taken by photographer Vicki Berndt, and an early Hole logo in pink text. Another Berndt photograph is featured on the first page of the EP's twenty-page booklet and was used by Sympathy for the Record Industry as an official promotional photograph a year later around the time of the release of Hole's debut studio album, Pretty on the Inside (1991). The booklet focuses strictly on Hole's early career and includes a full transcript of one of the band's first interviews for Flipside (issue 68) in September‚ÄìOctober 1990, accompanying photographs by Al Flipside, the cover of the \\"Retard Girl\\" single, flyers and posters for some of Hole's early shows and various text written by Courtney Love, including a quote of Proverbs 9:13 from The Bible. On the final credits page of the booklet, Hole gives special thanks to \\"Miss K. Sugarheart Belljar\\" (Kat Bjelland of Babes in Toyland, who features on the cover of the \\"Retard Girl\\" single) labelmate Mia Ferraro of the band Spoons and a member of staff at Olympia's Evergreen State College. According to Broadcast Music Incorporated's official web site, the songwriting credits on The First Session are mistaken. Although all the songs are listed as being written collectively written by Hole, Love wrote and composed \\"Retard Girl\\" solely by herself and the rest of the songs were written by both her and Erlandson. Release The First Session was released as Hole's second EP, following Ask for It (1995), on August 26, 1997 and was only issued in the United States. The release almost identically coincided with the release of the band's first compilation album, My Body, the Hand Grenade, released a month later on City Slang. Three songs from The First Session later appeared on My Body, the Hand Grenade and \\"Johnnie's in the Bathroom\\" was omitted. Both albums were released during Hole's reported hiatus, due in part to Love's acting career, and during the transitional period between Live Through This (1994) and Celebrity Skin (1998). Upon its release, the EP failed to attract much critical or commercial reception. Jason Akeny of Allmusic rated the album two and a half out of five stars, calling it \\"the same abrasive, barbed-wire juvenilia it's always been\\" and but praises \\"Eric Erlandson's lumpy, lurching guitar\\", \\"Courtney Love's ear-splitting screech\\" that \\"does achieve some kind of catharsis\\" and refers to \\"Johnnie's in the Bathroom\\" as \\"The Patti Smith homage.\\" Track listing Personnel Adapted from the album's liner notes.

Personal data  Michel was born June 5, 1934, to parents to Frank and Viola Michel. He was married to Bonnie Hausman, a web technical specialist. He had two children, Alice and Jeff by his wife Beverly who predeceased him, and three grandchildren. His hobbies were photography, tennis, handball, and baseball. Michel died at the age of 80 on February 26, 2015. He was buried with full military honors at the Houston National Cemetery.  Education  Michel graduated from C. K. McClatchy High School, located at Sacramento, California, in 1951. In 1955, he received a Bachelor of Science degree with honors in physics, and in 1962 he received a doctorate in physics, both from the California Institute of Technology. His thesis was \\"Beta Spectra of the Mass 12 Nuclei\\" and his dissertation advisor was Thomas Lauritsen. Nobel laureate William Alfred Fowler also served on his committee. While on the faculty of Rice University, Michel oversaw the dissertations of Jerry Modisette, Robert LaQuey, Robert Manka, Cliff Morris, Michael Pelizzari, J√ºrgen Krause-Polstorff, James Sokolowski, and Steven Sturner.  Organizations  Michel was a fellow of the American Physical Society and a member of the American Geophysical Union, and the American Astronomical Society.  Experience  Michel, seated front left, with NASA Astronaut Group 4 Michel was a junior engineer with the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company's guided missile division before joining the Air Force in 1955. As an Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) graduate, he received flight training at Marana Air Force Base, Arizona, and at Laredo Air Force Base and Perrin Air Force Base in Texas. During his three years of military service, Michel flew F-86D interceptors in the United States and in Europe (England and West Germany). Michel accumulated 1,000 hours flying time with 900 hours in jet aircraft. Following his tour of active duty in the United States Air Force, Michel was a graduate student and research fellow at the California Institute of Technology, doing experimental and theoretical work in nuclear physics for Lauritsen and Richard P. Feynman, along with work in theoretical astrophysics for Fowler. He joined the faculty of Rice University in Houston, Texas in July 1963. Michel's efforts there were directed at researching and teaching space sciences, such as the interaction of solar winds and the lunar atmosphere. Michel was selected as a scientist-astronaut in NASA Astronaut Group 4 in June 1965. He resigned from NASA on 18 August 1969 without having being assigned to any spaceflight missions. Michel decided to resign after it became clear that he would not be given a flight assignment, due to the scientific community's demands that his fellow astronaut, the professional geologist Harrison Schmitt, be reassigned to Michel's position on Apollo 17 after Schmitt's planned mission on Apollo 18 was cancelled. After his resignation from NASA, Michel returned to teaching and research at Rice, where he also served as chair of the space physics and astronomy department from 1974 to 1979. He was the Andrew Hays Buchanan Professor of Astrophysics from 1974 until his retirement in 2000. Michel was named a Guggenheim Fellow to the √âcole Polytechnique in Palaiseau, France, from 1979 to 1980, and was awarded a Humboldt Prize to study in Heidelberg at the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics, in West Germany, from 1983 to 1984. Following his retirement, Michel spent the 2001‚Äì2002 academic year in Japan at the Solar-Terrestrial Environment Laboratory of the University of Nagoya as a visiting professor.  Research  Michel's research spanned many disciplines. In 1964, he predicted the existence of spin \\"optical rotation\\" due to parity nonconserving weak interactions. This phenomenon was experimentally confirmed in 1980 and is used to study parity nonconserving weak interactions between neutrons and nuclei. Michel is best known for his work on pulsars and neutron star magnetospheres but his work also included solar wind interactions with the Moon and other bodies, extending to the heliopause. In 2000, Michel officially retired from Rice but he continued to be active in research until his death in 2015.

It defines ex cathedra the dogma of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. It was the first ex-cathedra infallible statement since the official ruling on papal infallibility was made at the First Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870). In 1854 Pope Pius IX made an infallible statement with Ineffabilis Deus on the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary, which was a basis for this dogma. The decree was promulgated on 1 November 1950.Encyclopedia of Catholicism by Frank K. Flinn, J. Gordon Melton 207 page 267 The dogma of the Assumption On 1 November 1950, invoking his dogmatic authority, Pope Pius XII defined the dogma: :By the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, of the Blessed Apostles Peter and Paul, and by our own authority, we pronounce, declare, and define it to be a divinely revealed dogma: that the Immaculate Mother of God, the ever Virgin Mary, having completed the course of her earthly life, was assumed body and soul into heavenly glory.Munificentissimus Deus, 44 Historical background Pope Pius XII's previous encyclical Deiparae Virginis Mariae (1 May 1946) to all Catholic bishops stated that for a long time past, numerous petitions had been received from cardinals, patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, priests, religious of both sexes, associations, universities and innumerable private persons, all begging that the bodily Assumption into heaven of the Blessed Virgin should be defined and proclaimed as a dogma of faith. This was also fervently requested by almost two hundred fathers in the Vatican Council (1869‚Äì1870). Following the example of Pope Pius IX, who canvassed Catholic bishops before proclaiming the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, Pius XII asked all bishops for their opinion. :Actually God, who from all eternity regards Mary with a most favorable and unique affection, has \\"when the fullness of time came\\" put the plan of his providence into effect in such a way that all the privileges and prerogatives he had granted to her in his sovereign generosity were to shine forth in her in a kind of perfect harmony. And, although the Church has always recognized this supreme generosity and the perfect harmony of graces and has daily studied them more and more throughout the course of the centuries, still it is in our own age that the privilege of the bodily Assumption into heaven of Mary, the Virgin Mother of God, has certainly shone forth more clearly.Munificentissimus Deus, ¬ß3 At issue was not the belief in the Assumption, but its dogmatisation. Munificentissimus Deus reports popular acclaim and \\"nearly unanimous\\" approval of the contemporary bishops. The names of the bishops attending the dogma celebration in 1950 are listed at the entrance of St. Peter's Basilica. Review of Catholic beliefs Reflecting on the history of this belief in Catholic Christian tradition, Pope Pius XII writes that \\"the holy Fathers and Doctors of the Church have never failed to draw enlightenment from this fact.\\"Munificentissimus Deus, 14 Munificentissimus Deus reviews the history of Catholic liturgy and the many liturgical books, \\"which deal with the feast either of the Dormition or of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin\\".Munificentissimus Deus, 15 Munificentissimus Deus cites also the teaching of previous popes and bishops and such writers as John of Damascus, Francis de Sales, Robert Bellarmine, Anthony of Padua and Albert the Great among others. George Tavard wrote: \\"In the theology of Pope Pius XII, the Assumption of Mary's body and soul into heaven flow from her Immaculate Conception.The end balances the beginning, both having their profound reason in Mary's mission as the Theotokos.\\"Tavard, George H., The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary, (Collegeille, Minnesota) Michael Glazier Books, 1996, p.198 Relevance to the faithful Written not long after the devastation of World War II, the encyclical conveys the hope that meditation on Mary‚Äôs assumption will lead the faithful to a greater awareness of our common dignity as the human family. In the dogmatic statement, the phrase \\"having completed the course of her earthly life\\" was carefully written to leave open the question of whether or not Mary died before her Assumption, or whether, like the Assumption of the Prophet Elijah, Mary was assumed before death; both possibilities are allowed in the formulation. In articles 14, 17 and 20 of the dogmatic pronouncement, however, it is stated that Mary had indeed died: \\"...the dead body of the Blessed Virgin Mary remained incorrupt, but ... she gained a triumph out of death, her heavenly glorification after the example of her only begotten Son, Jesus Christ.\\" The entire decree (and the title itself) is also worded to suggest that Mary's Assumption was not in any sense a logical necessity, but rather a divine gift to Mary as Mother of God. Munificentissimus Deus teaches that Mary lived and completed her life as a shining example to the human race. The gift of her assumption is offered to all the faithful and signifies what to hope for at the end of time. Her assumption signifies God's intention to all the faithful. :Thus, while the illusory teachings of materialism and the corruption of morals that follows from these teachings threaten to extinguish the light of virtue and to ruin the lives of men by exciting discord among them, in this magnificent way all may see clearly to what a lofty goal our bodies and souls are destined. Finally it is our hope that belief in Mary's bodily Assumption into heaven will make our belief in our own resurrection stronger and render it more effective. Non-Catholic opinion Paul Tillich asked fellow Protestant theologian Reinhold Niebuhr in March 1950, about eight months before the decree was promulgated, if he expected the Pope to make the declaration about Mary's assumption ex cathedra. Niebuhr replied: \\"I don't think so; he is too clever for that; it would be a slap in the face of the whole modern world and it would be dangerous for the Roman Church to do that today\\".Tillich, Paul. A History of Christian Thought: From its Judaic and Hellenistic Origins to Existentialism (1972), Simon and Schuster, (edited from his lectures and published posthumously by C. E. Braaten), . p. 224. Among the Eastern Orthodox (Dyophysite) and Oriental Orthodox (Monophysite: Copts, Armenians, Ethiopians, Eritreans) the dogma of the Dormition of the Theotokos is very much in agreement with the Roman Catholic dogma. Carl Jung, in the final chapters of his 1952 book Answer to Job, called the dogma \\"the most important religious event since the Reformation.\\" He chastized its Protestant critics for overlooking its real psychological significance. Namely, Jung saw it as the manifestation of a culminating desire for completion in the Christian psyche; recognizing the feminine side of the divine would ease the inevitable incarnation of the Holy Ghost in humanity.

The main area code, 617, was one of the original area codes from October 1947, and originally covered the eastern two-thirds of Massachusetts, from roughly the western end of Worcester County to Cape Cod and the South Coast. In July 1988, most of the western and southern portions of the old 617 territory, including Worcester, the South Coast and the Cape and Islands were split off as area code 508. Permissive dialing of 617 continued across eastern Massachusetts until January 1, 1989. In 1997, the northern and western portions of 617 split off as 781, which almost completely surrounds 617. This reduced 617 to Boston itself and its closer-in suburbs‚Äîan area largely coextensive with the inner ring of Greater Boston. This was intended as a long-term solution, but within three years 617 was close to exhaustion once again due to the demand for more phone lines for auxiliary devices (mobile phones, fax machines, pagers, and BBS lines). On May 2, 2001, 857 was overlaid onto 617. Since then, 10-digit local dialing has been mandatory.

They are similar to protocols. Interfaces are declared using the \`interface\` keyword, and may only contain method signature and constant declarations (variable declarations that are declared to be both \`static\` and \`final\`). All methods of an Interface do not contain implementation (method bodies) as of all versions below Java 8. Starting with Java 8, \`default\` and \`static\` methods may have implementation in the \`interface\` definition. Then, in Java 9, \`private\` and \`private static\` methods were added. At present, a Java interface can have up to six different types. Interfaces cannot be instantiated, but rather are implemented. A class that implements an interface must implement all of the non-default methods described in the interface, or be an abstract class. Object references in Java may be specified to be of an interface type; in each case, they must either be null, or be bound to an object that implements the interface. One benefit of using interfaces is that they simulate multiple inheritance. All classes in Java must have exactly one base class, the only exception being (the root class of the Java type system); multiple inheritance of classes is not allowed. However, an interface may inherit multiple interfaces and a class may implement multiple interfaces.  Overview  Interfaces are used to encode similarities which the classes of various types share, but do not necessarily constitute a class relationship. For instance, a human and a parrot can both whistle; however, it would not make sense to represent \`Human\`s and \`Parrot\`s as subclasses of a \`Whistler\` class. Rather they would most likely be subclasses of an \`Animal\` class (likely with intermediate classes), but both would implement the \`Whistler\` interface. Another use of interfaces is being able to use an object without knowing its type of class, but rather only that it implements a certain interface. For instance, if one were annoyed by a whistling noise, one may not know whether it is a human or a parrot, because all that could be determined is that a whistler is whistling. The call \`whistler.whistle()\` will call the implemented method \`whistle\` of object \`whistler\` no matter what class it has, provided it implements \`Whistler\`. In a more practical example, a sorting algorithm may expect an object of type . Thus, without knowing the specific type, it knows that objects of that type can somehow be sorted. For example: interface Bounceable { double pi = 3.1415; void setBounce(); // Note the semicolon // Interface methods are public, abstract and never final. // Think of them as prototypes only; no implementations are allowed. } An interface: * declares only method headers and public constants. * cannot be instantiated. * can be implemented by a class. * cannot extend a class. * can extend several other interfaces. Usage =Defining an interface= Interfaces are defined with the following syntax (compare to Java's class definition): [visibility] interface InterfaceName [extends other interfaces] { constant declarations abstract method declarations } Example: public interface Interface1 extends Interface2; The body of the interface contains abstract methods, but since all methods in an interface are, by definition, abstract, the \`abstract\` keyword is not required. Since the interface specifies a set of exposed behaviors, all methods are implicitly \`public\`. Thus, a simple interface may be public interface Predator { boolean chasePrey(Prey p); void eatPrey(Prey p); } The member type declarations in an interface are implicitly static, final and public, but otherwise they can be any type of class or interface.''' =Implementing interfaces in a class= The syntax for implementing an interface uses this formula: ... implements InterfaceName[, another interface, another, ...] ... Classes may implement an interface. For example: public class Lion implements Predator { @Override public boolean chasePrey(Prey p) { // Programming to chase prey p (specifically for a lion) } @Override public void eatPrey(Prey p) { // Programming to eat prey p (specifically for a lion) } } If a class implements an interface and does not implement all its methods, it must be marked as \`abstract\`. If a class is abstract, one of its subclasses is expected to implement its unimplemented methods, though if any of the abstract class' subclasses do not implement all interface methods, the subclass itself must be marked again as \`abstract\`. Classes can implement multiple interfaces: public class Frog implements Predator, Prey { ... } Interfaces can share common class methods: class Animal implements LikesFood, LikesWater { boolean likes() { return true; } } However a given class cannot implement the same or a similar interface multiple times: class Animal implements Shares, Shares ... // Error: repeated interface Interfaces are commonly used in the Java language for callbacks, as Java does not allow multiple inheritance of classes, nor does it allow the passing of methods (procedures) as arguments. Therefore, in order to pass a method as a parameter to a target method, current practice is to define and pass a reference to an interface as a means of supplying the signature and address of the parameter method to the target method rather than defining multiple variants of the target method to accommodate each possible calling class. =Subinterfaces= Interfaces can extend several other interfaces, using the same formula as described below. For example, public interface VenomousPredator extends Predator, Venomous { // Interface body } is legal and defines a subinterface. It allows multiple inheritance, unlike classes. \`Predator\` and \`Venomous\` may possibly define or inherit methods with the same signature, say \`kill(Prey p)\`. When a class implements \`VenomousPredator\` it will implement both methods simultaneously. Examples Some common Java interfaces are: * has the method , which is used to describe two objects as equal, or to indicate one is greater than the other. Generics allow implementing classes to specify which class instances can be compared to them. * is a marker interface with no methods or fields - it has an empty body. It is used to indicate that a class can be serialized. Its Javadoc describes how it should function, although nothing is programmatically enforced See also * Mixin * Trait (computer programming) References External links * What Is an Interface?

Alternative common names for this plant are Santa Cruz tarweed or Santa Cruz sunflower. Distribution The plant's principal range is on certain coastal terraces in Santa Cruz County and Monterey County. Smaller colonies are to the north in Alameda County, Contra Costa County, and Marin County.Jepson . accessed 11.14.2013 It is found from sea level to . Specifically Santa Cruz tarplant likes to inhabit terraced locations of coastal or valley prairie grasslands with underlying sandy clay soils. Its characteristic habitat is in the California coastal prairie ecosystem, which may be the oldest stable ecosystem of the temperate world dating from about 600,000 years ago. Description Santa Cruz tarplant is an annual wildflower that can grow to 50 cm tall, but is often much smaller. The flowering period is June to November. The growth habit is a single erect stem with larger specimens developing branches. Its leaves are linear and manifest longer near the plant base. The lower ranging leaves exhibit sharp, short teeth at their edges, while the upper leaves present edges that are rolled back, leading to a bristly feeling. Several other species have a similar general appearance, and can be easily mistaken for the Santa Cruz tarplant. The real Santa Cruz tarplant, though, has distinctive glands (see photos) that are not present in lookalikes. Holocarpha macradenia, commonly known as Santa Cruz tarweed, illustrating distinctive glands Zoom view of distinctive glands, one circled in red. The aroma of the plant has variously been described as strong, citrusy, tangerine and Christmas tree-like. The pungent smell protects it by repelling many would-be feeders. It has characteristic yellow daisy-like flowers, with black anthers giving the appearance of striking black dots in the flower center. It is distinguished by its large number of flowers: 8 to 16 three-lobed outer ray flowers and 40 to 90 central disk flowers, more than any others in the genus Holocarpha. The flowers are situated in dense clusters at the branch tips or along the branch on a very short stem. ;Drought tolerance The Santa Cruz tarplant has an extremely long tap root, allowing it to thrive longer into the season than most coastal wildflowers. The plant produces seedbanks, which may not germinate in the next season, but which can remain viable over a period of years. Blooming season is summer, when there is less competition for pollinators and also less competition for sunlight, since in its range many plants have died back from the summer drought. Further protection from the rainless summer is a resinous coating on leaves and stems, allowing retention of water until late in the season. These resins often adhere to livestock, and, in the case of facial adherence, lead to a mascara- like effect after dust adheres to the resin in turn. Protection and current status Santa Cruz tarplant had been considered almost extinct by the year 1960. Subsequently, it was listed as a California endangered species and federal threatened species.USDA: Legal status . accessed 11.14.2011.

In the 1980s other colonies were found in the San Francisco Bay Area, including a colony in Pinole, western Contra Costa County. Ex-situ conservation of that colony was used to allow construction of a new shopping center, and a limited number of seeds from that population were moved immediately across and east of Interstate 80 onto the CalTrans right-of-way.Gary Deghi, C. Michael Hogan et al., Final Environmental Impact Report of the Pinole Valley Shopping Center for the city of Pinole, Earth Metrics Incorporated (1986) Additional seeds from that population were moved onto East Bay Regional Parks property, where most of these introduced populations died. In another touch-and-go experiment, Santa Cruz tarplant has been shown to barely hang on at the Arana Gulch colony in Santa Cruz, mostly due to lack of appropriate management, habitat fragmentation, and competition with non-native species. Active restoration experiments began in 2007 at Tarplant Hill in Watsonville by the owners, with support from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Partners in Restoration Program. Populations Protected as Critical Habitat In 2002, the US Fish and Wildlife Service published the final designation of Critical Habitat for the species, as follows: UNIT A - Mezue (Contra Costa County, Wildcat Canyon Regional Park) - County/City ownership.

In 2002, where plants naturally occurred, was mowed twice as well as treated with a chain harrow.Report - \\"Management Actions and Population Trends For the Twin Lakes Population of Holocarpha macradenia Santa Cruz Tarplant September 1998 thru July 2003\\" N/D by Tim Hyland, California State Parks Resource Ecologist Santa Cruz District Population trends in individual plant populations Ecological restoration projects to restore individual populations of the plants, their annual reports usually contain plant counts or estimations of the numbers of plants with a population during a certain year, and that data can be used to measure trends and successes of the restoration techniques used. The Arana Gulch (Unit D) population first census in 1986 by Randy Morgan estimated that there were 100,000 plants on that site in Santa Cruz, and by 2006 had dropped to only 348 plants. Plants counts in 2013 only found 18 plants, in 2014 only 4 plants, and in 2015 zero, and 2016 34 plants. The Arana Gulch restoration methods tried so far, are burning, grazing annually with cattle, and scraping.

The project was delayed several times, and sits on a large parcel of prime land in the city's downtown core, on the north side of Yonge-Dundas Square. The complex was owned and developed by PenEquity Management Corp., but is now owned by 10 Dundas St. Ltd. History The future site of 10 Dundas East, circa 1985, when it was still occupied by a Mr. Submarine restaurant and a video arcade Before 1998, the site was occupied by several buildings including the O'Keefe's Brewery (formerly Victoria Brewery) and a two-storey structure at the corner. From 1949 to 1974 it was home to the Brown Derby tavern and in the 1980s as a Mr. Submarine location. Many views of that intersection, and the local area as it looked in 1986, can be seen in the movie Short Circuit starring Ally Sheedy. All the buildings were demolished in the 1980s and 1990s. The project was approved in 1998 with the opening planned for 2000. The land was expropriated by the City of Toronto immediately afterwards,Christopher Hume, \\"We don't deserve this \\". Toronto Star, January 14, 2008. and while construction boarding soon went up, the project suffered shutdowns and major delays. While under construction it was known as Metropolis (as late as 2007), but when it opened, the complex was renamed \\"Toronto Life Square\\" after the local magazine. After the building was placed in court-ordered receivership in 2009, St. Joseph Communications, the owner of Toronto Life magazine, initiated a court action to have the magazine's name removed from the complex. The building was renamed \\"10 Dundas East\\" in September 2009. Entertainment Properties, a Kansas City-based real estate investment trust that had provided construction financing for the project in 2005, acquired the complex in March 2010. Architecture The project was built in an L-configuration around a number of existing buildings, including a parking garage belonging to the adjacent Ryerson University; in exchange for the air rights to build over its land, Ryerson gained use of the movie theatres as classrooms during daytime hours. The exterior facing Dundas Square is primarily covered with giant video screens and static billboard advertisements of various sizes. The Yonge Street facade is made up of curtainwall store fronts with a glass and steel canopy overhanging the sidewalk. Toronto Star architecture critic Christopher Hume wrote a lengthy piece in the newspaper entitled \\"We don't deserve this \\", which decried the building as a \\"nasty dark grey bunker\\". Daily Hive alluded the facade to Blade Runner 2049 per local artist Lucan Coutts. Retail 10 Dundas Square East is anchored by a Cineplex Cinemas 23-screen movie theatre, Dollarama, an Adidas Sport Store, and restaurants including Jack Astor's and Milestones.

It is black and has a gel-like consistency. Aerobic digestion of the peat by bacteria forms humic acid and reduces the peat in the first oxygenated metre (generally 0.5 metre) of the peat column. As the peat is buried under new peat or soil the oxygen is reduced, often by water logging, and further degradation by anaerobic microbes, anaerobic digestion can produce gyttja. The gyttja then slowly drains to the bottom of the column. It pools at the bottom of the peat column, about below the surface or wherever it is stopped by e.g. compacted soil/peat, bedrock, or permafrost. Gyttja accumulates as long as new material is added to the top of the column and the conditions are right for anaerobic degradation of the peat. Gyttja can form in layers reflecting changes in the environment as with other sedimentary rock. Gyttja is the part of peat that forms coal, but it must be buried under thousands of meters for coalification to occur because it has to be hot enough to drive off the water it contains (see dopplerite).

For his son, Vic Clapham the graphic artist well known in South African Scouting, see Victor J. Clapham. Vic Clapham was the founder of the Comrades Marathon, the world's largest ultra-marathon, of approximately 90 km held annually between Durban and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa. As a World War I veteran, Vic Clapham conceived the race to commemorate the South African soldiers killed during the war. It was run for the first time on 24 May 1921 and has been run more than 80 times since then, now with an average field of 20,000 runners. Early life Vic Clapham was born in London on 16 November 1886 and arrived in the Cape Colony in South Africa with his parents at the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899. Vic Clapham attended Wynberg Boys' High School. First World War At the start of the First World War, he signed up with the 8th South African Infantry which was sent to German East Africa, now Tanzania. During this time he marched over 2700 kilometres in pursuit of General Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck's askari battalions. The Comrades Marathon After the war ended, Clapham wanted to establish a memorial to the suffering and deaths of his comrades during the war, and their camaraderie in overcoming these hardships. He conceived of an extremely demanding race where the physical endurance of entrants could be put to the test. Clapham asked for permission to stage a 56-mile race between Pietermaritzburg and Durban under the name of the Comrades Marathon, and for it to become a living memorial to the spirit of the soldiers of the Great War. Permission was at first refused but was eventually granted. The first Comrades Marathon took place on 24 May 1921, Empire Day, starting outside the City Hall in Pietermaritzburg with 34 runners. It has been run every year since then, except for the years 1941-1945 during the Second World War. The constitution of the race today states that one of its primary aims is to \\"celebrate mankind's spirit over adversity\\".

He was one of the six scientists selected in 1965, in NASA's fourth group of astronauts, for the Apollo program. He was best known for being immersed in water for seven days as part of his zero gravity deconditioning research while working as a United States Air Force (USAF) research scientist. Personal Graveline was born on March 2, 1931, in Newport, Vermont. His hobbies included medical consulting in microgravity deconditioning and galactic cosmic radiation and personal health maintenance. Graveline died at the age of 85 on September 5, 2016. Graveline's ashes were interred at Arlington National Cemetery on May 3, 2017 with full military honors. Education Graveline graduated from Newport High School in 1948. He received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Vermont in 1951 and his Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Vermont College of Medicine in 1955. Following his internship at Walter Reed, he specialized in aerospace medicine, receiving his Masters in Public Health degree from Johns Hopkins University in 1958. Career Graveline entered the United States Air Force Medical Service after graduation from medical college. Following internship he attended the primary course in Aviation Medicine, Class 56C, at Randolph Air Force Base and was assigned to Kelly Air Force Base as Chief of the Aviation Medicine Service. Graveline was granted the aeronautical rating of flight surgeon in February 1957. From September 1957 to June 1958, he attended Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health, where he received his master's degree in Public Health. He then attended the Aerospace Medical residency at the Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine, completing his residency training in July 1960 at Brooks Air Force Base and receiving his specialty certification by the American Board in Preventative Medicine. At that time he was assigned to the Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory as research scientist with special interest in prolonged weightlessness deconditioning and countermeasures. In July 1962, he returned to Brooks Air Force Base where he continued his research, served as intelligence analyst for Soviet bioastronautics and was active as a NASA flight controller for the Mercury and Gemini missions. Graveline authored ten professional publications and reports on biological deconditioning and weightlessness countermeasures. His research involved bed rest and water immersion to study deconditioning. While in the USAF he did the original research on both the extremity tourniquet and the prototype lower body negative pressure device for use in prolonged zero gravity missions. NASA's operational lower body negative pressure device has seen use in the Soviet MIR, as well as on the shuttle and station research. His 2004 research on space medicine was studying the effect of galactic \\"heavies\\" in the brains of mice, using iron ions and NASA's linear accelerator at Brookhaven, NY. In June 1965, Graveline was selected with NASA's first group of scientist astronauts and assigned to Williams Air Force Base for jet pilot training. He resigned on August 18, 1965, prior to flying in space. He was the first astronaut to resign prior to being assigned a mission. Although this was ascribed to \\"personal reasons,\\" it was later disclosed in Deke Slayton's memoir that Graveline resigned due to his impending divorce. According to Slayton, \\"The program didn't need a scandal. A messy divorce meant a quick ticket back to wherever you came from.\\" His wife Carol had stated in the court papers that her husband had \\"violent and ungovernable outbursts of temper.\\" Upon his resignation, Graveline stayed with NASA for three months as a doctor in Houston before returning to civilian life. Graveline practiced medicine as a family doctor in Burlington, Vermont, during which time he also served as a flight surgeon for the Vermont Army National Guard. Upon his retirement at age sixty, Graveline became a writer of medical and science fiction thrillers with 15 novels to his credit. Graveline married a total of six times. Following his experience with cholesterol drug side effects, Graveline became a critic of the use of statins to treat high cholesterol levels. While on Lipitor, Graveline developed transient global amnesia and could not recognize his family. He slowly recovered after stopping this medication. NASA physicians then prescribed half the dose, but the amnesia returned. Graveline was a contributor to the book NASA's Scientist- Astronauts by David Shayler and Colin Burgess.

To this end, it cooperates with various religious institutes and advocacy groups, as well as scholarly, ecumenical, and international organizations. Among its reference works is the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church. Effective 1 January 2017, the work of the Council was assumed by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development and Cardinal Peter Turkson became Prefect of the Dicastery.  Origin  The Second Vatican Council had proposed the creation of a body of the universal Church whose role would be \\"to stimulate the Catholic Community to foster progress in needy regions and social justice on the international scene\\". It was in reply to this request that Pope Paul VI established the Pontifical Commission \\"Justitia et Pax\\" by a Motu Proprio dated 6 January 1967 (Catholicam Christi Ecclesiam). Two months later, in Populorum Progressio, Paul VI succinctly stated of the new body that \\"its name, which is also its programme, is Justice and Peace\\" (No. 5). Gaudium et Spes and this Encyclical, which \\"in a certain way... applies the teaching of the Council\\", were the founding texts and points of reference for this new body. After a ten-year experimental period, Paul VI gave the Commission its definitive status with the Motu Proprio Iustitiam et Pacem of 10 December 1976. When the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus of 28 June 1988 reorganized the Roman Curia, Pope John Paul II changed its name from Commission to Pontifical Council and reconfirmed the general lines of its work.  Objectives and mandate  Pastor Bonus defined the objectives and mandate of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in the following terms: \\"The Council will promote justice and peace in the world, in the light of the Gospel and of the social teaching of the Church (art. 142). ¬ß 1. It will deepen the social doctrine of the Church and attempt to make it widely known and applied, both by individuals and communities, especially as regards relations between workers and employers. These relations must be increasingly marked by the spirit of the Gospel. ¬ß 2. It will assemble and evaluate various types of information and the results of research on justice and peace, the development of peoples and the violations of human rights. When appropriate, it will inform Episcopal bodies of the conclusions drawn. It will foster relations with international Catholic organizations and with other bodies, be they Catholic or not, that are sincerely committed to the promotion of the values of justice and peace in the world. ¬ß 3. It will heighten awareness of the need to promote peace, above all on the occasion of the World Day of Peace (art. 143). It will maintain close relations with the Secretariat of State, especially when it deals publicly with problems of justice and peace in its documents or declarations (art. 144)\\". Structure The Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace has a President who is assisted by a Secretary and an Under-Secretary, all named by the Pope for a period of five years. A staff of lay persons, religious and priests of different nationalities works with them in carrying out the programmes and activities of the Council. The Pope also appoints about forty Members and Consultors who serve in a personal capacity for a period of five years. Coming from different parts of the world, the Members meet in Rome at regular intervals for a Plenary Assembly during which each one, according to his or her background and professional or pastoral experience, contributes to the overall planning for the activities of the Pontifical Council. A high point in the life of the Council, the Plenary Assembly is a time of authentic discernment of the \\"signs of the times\\". The Consultors, some of whom are experts in the social teaching of the Church, can be called upon to participate in working groups on specific topics. On Saturday, May 16, 2015, Pope Francis named the Reverend Father Timothy Radcliffe, O.P., Director of the Las Casas Institute of Blackfriars in Oxford, England, which does studies on social justice and human rights, as one of the Consultors. =Presidents of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace= *Maurice Roy (6 January 1967 - 16 December 1976) *Bernardin Gantin (15 December 1976 - 8 April 1984) *Roger Etchegaray (8 April 1984 - 24 June 1998) *Fran√ßois-Xavier Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn Thu·∫≠n (24 June 1998 - 16 September 2002) *Renato Martino (1 October 2002 - 24 October 2009) *Peter Turkson (24 October 2009 - 1 January 2017) =Secretaries of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace= * Joseph Gremillion (1966‚Äì1974) * Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo (1976 ‚Äì 5 May 1977) * Roger Joseph Heckel, S.J.

(22 October 2009 - 19 January 2015) Activities The primary work of the Pontifical Council is to engage in action-oriented studies based on both the papal and episcopal social teaching of the Church. Through them, the Pontifical Council also contributes to the development of this teaching in the following vast fields: * Justice: the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace is concerned with all that touches upon social justice, the world of work, international life, development in general and social development in particular. It also promotes ethical reflection on the evolution of economic and financial systems and addresses problems related to the environment and the responsible use of the Earth's resources. * Peace: the Pontifical Council reflects on a broad range of questions related to war, disarmament and the arms trade, international security, and violence in its various and ever-changing forms (terrorism, exaggerated nationalism etc.). It also considers the question of political systems and the role of Catholics in the political arena. It is responsible for the promotion of the World Day of Peace. * Human rights: this question has assumed increasing importance in the mission of the Church and consequently in the work of the Pontifical Council. Pope John Paul II consistently stressed that the dignity of the human person is the foundation of the promotion and defense of his or her inalienable rights. The Council deals with the subject from three perspectives: deepening the doctrinal aspect, dealing with questions under discussion in international organizations, showing concern for the victims of the violation of human rights. There was a two-day (June 16 and 17, 2011 \\"Executive Summit on Ethics for the Business World\\", which examined Christian views, from the Catholic perspective of Pope Benedict XVI's on financial ethics and possible positive Christian-based alternatives to contemporary status quo secular best practices in the field. The summit was co-hosted by the Pontifical Regina Apostolorum University and the Fidelis International Institute, as well as the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. According to an online news story on the conference by Carol Glatz of Catholic News Service, on Friday, June 17, 2011, \\"The Vatican and some Catholic thinkers are urging businesses to not only employ ethical policies within their companies, but to become dedicated to bringing economic justice to the wider world. In fact, people should be wary of superficial ethical practices that \\"are adopted primarily as a marketing device, without any effect on relationships inside and outside the business itself\\" and without promoting justice and the common good, said Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, the Vatican's secretary of state. Cardinal Bertone was one of a number of speakers invited to the Executive Summit on Ethics for the Business World, sponsored by the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace and the Legionairies of Christ's Fidelis International Institute, which promotes ethics in business. The June 16‚Äì17 conference brought high-profile leaders from the manufacturing, industrial, banking and financial sectors including representatives from General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as Catholic experts in Catholic social teaching. \\"Everyone here has been 'cherry-picked.' It wasn't an open invitation to everybody,\\" said Father Luis Garza Medina, vicar general of the Legionairies of Christ, who helped in the planning of the event. Organizers purposely chose people from different industries, countries and religions in order to hammer out ethical principles held in common, which often reflect the views inherent in Catholic social thought, namely the principles of the centrality of the human person, subsidiarity, solidarity and the pursuit of the common good, he told Catholic News Service June 17. The real challenge, however, is taking those common principles and translating them into concrete action that will have a real impact on local and world economies, and on people's lives, he said. The meeting's goal was to show how \\"Charity in Truth\\", Pope Benedict XVI's 2009 encyclical on social justice issues, could inspire leaders to find practical applications of these universal values. In his talk June 16, Cardinal Bertone said the encyclical makes clear that there is no way businesses can remain ethically neutral: They are either serving the common good or they are not,\\" In August 2011 the Council issued a \\"Note\\" entitled \\"Towards Reforming the International Financial and Monetary System in the context of Global Public Authority\\", which includes the further development of the theme already presented in Caritas in Veritate. Network The Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace collaborates with all those within the Church who are seeking the same ends. As an organism of the Holy See, the Council is first and foremost at the service of the Pope, and also collaborates with other departments of the Roman Curia. As a body of the universal Church, it is also at the service of the local Churches. It maintains systematic contacts with Episcopal Conferences and their regional groupings and collaborates regularly with them. Through the Episcopal Conferences, or with their assent, the Pontifical Council likewise is in touch with a broad range of Church bodies on the national level that have been established to make the faithful aware of their responsibilities in the field of justice and peace. Some of these are primarily for study and reflection, while others are more action-oriented. They include national Justice and Peace Commissions or Commissions for Social Questions, movements for the defense of human rights or for the promotion of peace or development etc. The Pontifical Council maintains contact with the various institutions or international movements within the Church (religious institutes, international Catholic organizations) that, in communion with the Bishops, help Christians to bear witness to their faith in the social field. The Pontifical Council also turns to the academic and intellectual world and seeks the advice of professors of the social teaching of the Church, especially those from the Pontifical Universities in Rome. It has, moreover, systematic links with the Pontifical Academy for Social Sciences. Enriching contacts with other churches and religions have been established as a result of the mandate of the Pontifical Council to work from an ecumenical perspective. The Pontifical Council collaborates in a special way with the World Council of Churches. Finally, mention must be made of various links with secular organizations working for the promotion of justice, peace and the respect for human dignity. Over the years, relations with international organizations have increased considerably. Because of the interest of the Holy See in the work of the United Nations, the Pontifical Council, in collaboration with the Secretariat of State, has frequent contacts with the United Nations and its specialized agencies, especially at the time of the major international conferences that deal with such questions as development, population, environment, international trade, or human rights. Equal importance is given to regional organizations, among which the Council of Europe and the European Union. The Pontifical Council also welcomes exchanges with non-governmental organizations that share its aims and are working in the field of peace, justice and human rights. Publications The Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace issues documents on current topics such as the international debt, racism, the international arms trade and land distribution. In each case, these documents draw on the social teaching of the Church in formulating pertinent ethical principles and guidelines. The Council also publishes books: reports of meetings that it has organized, systematic collections of pontifical texts on a particular social question, studies on contemporary issues, such as the perspective of the Catholic Church on human rights, the environment, or the ethical dimensions of the economy, financial activities and the world of work. The purpose of these publications is to spread knowledge of the social teaching of the Church, especially among those who can in turn make it known directly or indirectly to others. They include Episcopal Conferences and their Justice and Peace Commissions or Commissions for Social Questions, associations and movements of the laity, priests, religious, seminarians and religious educators.

It was enlarged in 1802 by the addition of the former Diocese of Avranches and of two archdeaconries from the Diocese of Bayeux. Since 1854 its bishops have held the title of Bishop of Coutances (‚ÄìAvranches). The Bishop of Coutances exercised ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Channel Islands, mostly in Alderney where the Bishop also held partial authority over the Leader of Alderney, until the Reformation, despite the secular division of Normandy in 1204. The final rupture occurred definitively in 1569 when Queen Elizabeth I demanded that the Bishops hand the island over to the Bishop of Winchester. History of the Diocese of Coutances In 1757 the city of Coutances had a population of about 12,000 Catholics. The Cathedral was dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Its Chapter was composed of eight dignities (the Cantor, four Archdeacons, the Scholasticus, the Treasurer, and the Penitentiary) and twenty-five Canons. There were also six Choral Vicars, forty-two chaplains, fourteen choristers and six boy singers, and a body of musicians. The Cantor has existed from the 11th century. The four archdeacons were: Coutances, Baptois, Val-de-Vire and Cotentin.Pouill√©s (surveys of benefices) of the diocese of Coutances, in: In the city were two parishes (Saint-Pierre and Saint-Nicolas), two houses of male religious, and two monasteries of monks. The entire diocese had some 500 parishes.Gallia christiana XI, p. 863, 908. Lecanu, II, pp. 95-114. Ritzler, VI, p. 179 note 1. The diocese contained seven houses of Benedictine monks: Saint-Sever, Lessay, Saint-Sauveur le Vicomte, Montebourg, Hambie, Notre-Dame de Protection (Valognes, 1626, women), and Notre-Dame des Anges (Coutances, 1633, women). There was a house of Premonstratensians at Blanchelande; and two houses of Augustinians, at Saint-L√¥ and Notre-Dame de Voeu at Cherbourg.Gallia christiana XI, p. 912-913. Jean, p. 352. All were abolished by will of the Constituent Assembly in 1790, and their properties confiscated and sold. Monastic vows were dissolved and forbidden. On 12 April 1791 the priests of the seminary were expelled for refusing to take the Oath to the Constitution. On 15 January 1793 the turn came of the houses of women to be closed and confiscated, and their inhabitants forcibly ejected.Lecanu, II, p. 106. History of the Diocese of Avranches The Cathedral of Avranches, situated in a town of some 2500 inhabitants in 1764, was dedicated to Saint Andrew on 17 September 1211. The Chapter of the Cathedral had six dignities (the Dean, the Cantor, the Treasurer, the Scholasticus and the two Archdeacons) and eighteen Canons. The archdeacons were named Archidiaconus Abricensis and Archidiaconus Vallis Moretonii.Pouill√©s of the diocese of Avranches: The town contained three parishes, one community of male religious and one monastery of monks. The entire diocese contained 170 parishes.Gallia christiana XI, pp. 466-467. Ritzler, VI, p. 61 note 1. In the nineteenth century the diocese of Avranches had 177 parishes and was the smallest diocese in the Province of Rouen: Jean, p. 343. The Diocese of Avranches was abolished during the French Revolution by the Legislative Assembly, under the Civil Constitution of the Clergy (1790). Its territory was subsumed into the new diocese, called 'Manche', with its seat at Coutances, which was part of the Metropolitanate called the 'C√¥tes de la Manche' (which included eight new 'd√©partements'), with its seat at Rouen (Seine-Inf√©rieure). When the Concordat of 1801 was struck between Pope Pius VII and First Consul Bonaparte, the Diocese of Avranches was not revived.

Fife's followers regard him as a modern-day apostle and prophet. Early life Sam Fife was born about 1926 in Miami, Florida, the son of Samuel Drew Fife, Sr., and Maude Iva Cox. He served in the U.S. Navy in World War II. Ministry Sam Fife graduated from New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary in March 1957. He received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit experience while pastoring Bible Baptist Church in the city. He was called to Miami, where his first church was called \\"The Miami Revival Center.\\" It was located in an old frame building on 22nd Street. Following a period of self-admitted deception, in 1963 while attending prayer meetings, Fife felt he had received the true divine revelation. He began preaching and starting up new groups all over United States. The network of assemblies came to refer to themselves loosely as \\"the move of God\\" or more frequently, \\"the move\\" to avoid denominational connotations. In fall 1971, believing the Tribulation and Second Coming of Christ were near, Fife began to preach a message that the end-time saints must go to \\"the wilderness\\" \\"to the place God had prepared for the woman.\\" Soon after, thousands of his followers left their homes, jobs, and security and moved to Canada, Colombia, and Alaska to establish communal farms in isolated areas. These \\"end time farms\\" were the beginning of a new direction of Fife's ministry. Fife and three of his American followers died on April 26, 1979, when the private airplane he was piloting through heavy fog crashed into a mountainside in Guatemala1. He is buried in the Guatemalan city of Quetzaltenango. He had preached a doctrine of immortality, and taught that the aging process had stopped for him. When asked his age he would simply answer \\"I AM.\\" He assured people that he would never die but was in the process of being changed into an incorruptible life.2 Teachings Espousing a similar hermeneutic to those of Latter Rain Movement proponents George Warnock and Bill Britton, much of Sam Fife's teachings were based upon metaphorical meanings of passages in the Old Testament, such as the Tabernacle of Moses, the Feast of Tabernacles, Gideon's 300, as well as various verses in the New Testament such as the Manifestation of the sons of God. Fife believed that the time was drawing close for a group of believers to reach a state of sinless perfection, through a process of God's dealings with them, and manifest who God is to the world. That process, he believed, was through the work of the Fivefold ministry. In his booklet The Manifestation of the Sons of God, Fife interprets Ephesians 4:11‚Äì13 in the following way: > \\"The fact that these ministries were given for the perfecting of the saints > makes it clear that these ministries will not pass away until the saints > have been perfected ... It is also clear that God purposes for the last day > saints to come to perfection here and become the manifested sons of God of > Romans 8 who shall deliver the earth from 'the bondage of corruption'.\\"3 In his book One Corporate Man, Sam Fife states: > \\"Therefore let all men know, that in this dispensation of the fullness of > times, God is going to fulfill His purpose to bring together into one, all > things that are in Christ, both in the earth and in heaven, and make of all > the twos, one new many-membered man, who lives after the order of > Melchisedec. When He has finished preparing this many-membered man, He is > going to purge the earth of every other man by His Judgment Day, and there > will come in a new age, and a new earth, with a new man living in a new > order, where every member is so dead to self that he lives unto the rest of > the Body, and that order shall perpetuate eternal life.\\"4 See also *The Move *Latter Rain (post-World War II movement) References # ‚Äî This is a report bringing out the \\"move's\\" tendencies and referring to it as \\"The Body of Christ\\". # Kingdom Triumphalism: The 3rd WAVE.

Together with Rybovich, Merritt is respected as one of the most historically significant Florida custom sport fishing boat builders. Birth of the Sportfish In the 1930s and the 1940s, blue marlin and bluefin tuna were abundant in the waters of Cuba, Bimini and Cat Cay just a few miles off the Florida coast, targeted by fishermen such as Ernest Hemingway, and Habana Joe aboard his 1938 40-foot Wheeler named Pilar. Word spread quickly among fishermen around the world about the exciting new sport of big game fishing. Despite the growing popularity of the sport, however, the boats of the day were hardly ideal for the challenges of fighting the prized fish. Most boats utilized in those days were converted cabin cruisers and all were relatively slow and hard to maneuver. Merritt gained particular notoriety during the 1950s through the 1970s with its 37- and custom sport fishing boats, which, together with boats like those being built at the same time by Rybovich, gave birth to a new category of fishing yachts and helped fuel the growth of big game sportfishing in the United States and around the world. There is an active community of classic sport fishing boat enthusiasts who continue to restore, maintain and fish these boats around the globe. History After leaving their Long Island home in 1947, Franklin and Ennis Merritt purchased a tract of land on the Intracoastal Waterway in Pompano Beach, Florida. In 1948 Merritt Boat and Engine Works was born. The boatyard was set up primarily to maintain the Merritt's charter boats, in addition to other charter and drift boats in the area. The yard began building boats in 1955. The Merritt's sons, Buddy and Allen became involved, with buddy running the boat building division and Allen overseeing and administering the business. Soon after Buddy‚Äôs passing in 1971, a third generation Merritt took over the managing of the boatyard. Roy, the son of Allen and Millie Merritt had worked in the yard since his early teens. Today Roy Merritt runs the day-to-day operations at Merritt's. =The 37 Footers= An avid fisherman, Buddy Merritt built what he perceived to be the perfect fishing boat. The first of his 37-footers were totally lacking the luxuries taken for granted today. They were built for one purpose: to raise and catch fish. In all, 13 of these famed 37-footers were built, and 12 survive to this day (one was lost to fire caused by stray fireworks while the boat was out of the water in a boat yard). The Merritt 37 and the Rybovich 36 pioneered a style that gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s with an open deckhouse (no bulkhead aft) and a flying bridge. Ryco Marine hull #6 imitated this style in 1991 with its launch of a dayboat, Wildcat. Hull construction was typically strip planked with 1\\"x2\\" Yellow Cedar fastened to Mahogany frames and stringers. Merritts built from 1955-1967 *Caliban (USCG #276422, Hull #3) was built in 1955. Her last known name was Merittime, owned by Merrittime Charters, Inc. Over the years other known names include Striper, Meltemi, Sweat, Chips, Hooked II, Papa, Billy B, and Big Bad John. *Val Jean (USCG #278638, Hull #4) was built in 1957 for Richard Horvath. It is run as a charter boat named the Do Stay by Capt. Elbert \\"Elly\\" Brown in Jupiter, Florida. The second owner of the boat was a Chevy dealer named Dick Raffo who named the boat Chevy Won. Prior to Brown's ownership as the fourth owner, she was known as Patricia and owned by Jim Cullen. When Elly Brown and wife Viola bought the boat, they renamed her after their two children: \\"Do\\" for Douglas and \\"Stay\\" for Stacy. Today, the Do Stay fishes out of the Seasport Marina on the Jupiter Inlet. In 1984, Capt. Brown signed up a young New Yorker, Jeff Bicel, as a first mate. He remains aboard the Do Stay today. *Windsong (USCG #280634, Hull #5) was built in 1959 for Tore Hembe. In later years she was known as Barbara Jo, Caracal, Comparss Rose, Cheetah, Mistress, Thunder, Sportin' Life, Sassy Lady, Old Lady. In November, 2005 she was sold and moved from San Juan, Puerto Rico to Stuart, Florida to undergo a complete restoration by Gamefisherman & named \\"Friendship\\" in Virginia Beach.in 2009 She is renamed \\"Leilani\\" and was located in Western Samoa, in 2016 she was renamed BENCHMARK and moved to Kona, Hawaii. *Joan E. (USCG #283725, Hull #6) was built in 1960 for Ralph Rau. It was later known as Wildcatter and Infinity before Annali. *Timid Tuna (USCG #284725, Hull #7) was built in 1962 for Dale Schaefer. Subsequently she was known as Drummond, Dorothy D., Lady B., Easy Rider, Miltwon, Amanda, Lady Jane, Edith Ann and GAF VII. Her most recent owner was Anthony Pope, a noted member of the Italian-American community whose family gained notoriety through its ownership of American Media, publishers of the National Enquirer. While owned by Pope, GAF VII underwent a massive series of upgrades, beyond anything ever done to a boat of this small size, at a cost of more than one million dollars, including installation of huge 500 hp Cummings diesel engines. Bought by Aviation Insurance mogul Lance Paige Toland in 2012, updated and refreshed in Ft Lauderdale, renamed Ansley Ruth after Toland's daughter and is now docked on Sea Island, Georgia at the World-famous Cloister Hotel. *Tuna Teaser (USCG #286170, Hull #8) was built in 1961 for Art Appleton. She was later known as Born Free, Sachem, Seaquirt, and most recently Release. The boat is now in Guatemala. *Caliban (USCG #287912 Hull #9) was built in 1962 for Bill Carpenter. In the 1980s she was bought by Stewart Campbell who named it \\"Chunda\\". The boat is now in Venezuela, named Sangria I and has a pink hull *Finest Kind (USCG #290114, Hull #10) was built in 1963 for Dorothea Dean. She was later named Nefertiti, Ballyhoo, My Way, Jingo, High Roller, Princess Claudia, Live Wire, Cookie Monster, Jolly Roger and Bulldog. *Sunny Bunch (USCG #293145, Hull #11) was built in 1963 for a Mr. Irwin. Subsequently she was named Ole, Sea Hub, Recipe, Maverick and most recently, Northern Lights. She operates as a charter boat in Kona, Hawaii captained by Kona native Kevin Nakamaru, who is the only captain to have caught both a 1,000 pound (\\"grander\\") Black Marlin and a grander Blue Marin in both the Atlantic and the Pacific. *Alligator (USCG #294956, Hull #12) was built in 1964 for Jack Rounick. Jack founded Korvettes department store chain and owned the South Hampton NY \\"House of 7 chimneys\\" on the ocean. Today she is based in Maui, Hawaii as a charter boat named Finest Kind. Finest Kind is a 3rd generation charter company and has been owner operated for over 32 years. Finest Kind boasts a record of having caught the most Marlin on Maui since 1972. Jimmy Donovan was the boats first captain, Robert S Langdon (Fishn Bob as he was known to Montauk fisherman by his licence plates and big heart) was the First Mate. The Alligator was shipped cargo and fished Australia's great barrior reef. Based in Montauk NY she docked at the \\"Deep Sea Club\\". Her original engines had turbo chargers added in the late 60's making the Alligator Montauk's fastest sportfishing boat. *Windsong (USCG #503211, Hull #14) was built in 1965 for Tore Hembe, and was later known as No Problem and Hoolili. *Sandra D. (USCG #507428, Hull #15) was built in 1967 for Sam Evert. Later she was named Echoes in the 1980s. She was subsequently owned by Roy & Allen Merritt and named Caliban, Cadence, CBM and then Rowdy hailing from Bristol, Rhode Island until April 2014 when she was purchased by Bob & Kristin Mondo renamed Andiamo! and moved to Jensen Beach, FL. She was repowered in 2016 with Cummins QSB 380hp engines. *Decoy (Hull #16) was built in 1967 for Richard Freydberg. She was subsequently named Jane Ann, Sea Angler, Renegade, Wild Orange and Lady. She is located in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii and is owned by Gary Nordloh. Gary Nordloh purchased the ‚ÄúLady‚Äù in March 2010 and put her in dry dock to rebuild and refurbish the vessel which had been neglected for many years after the previous owner Bill Hoey passed away in 2004. Bill Hoey owned and meticulously maintained Lady for over 15 years. During the first six months of Gary Nordloh's ownership, Lady was refurbished to pristine condition. Her decks, fuel tanks, and headliner were rebuilt and the teak and trim was upgraded throughout with the assistance of master craftsmen Larry Greggs. =The 43 Footers= The 43 marked the transition from framed to cold molded construction. The inspiration for the 43 was the Hopalong, built for Fletch Creamer and Capt. Buddy Lander in 1965. At Hull No. 13, it was the longest boat Buddy Merritt had built at the time. The boat went on to become the Black Bart, owned by Bart Miller in Kona, Hawaii. This was the boat that caught the famous 1,656-pound Pacific blue marlin, the boat that won the 1975 Hawaiian International Allison-Yellowfin Tuna Tournament with a 2,000-point lead, and the boat that became the first to land more than 100 blue marlin in a season off Kona. Today Bart Miller's \\"Black Bart\\" fishing lures are one of the leading brands on the market. The switch to cold molded construction was noted by production builders, such as Buddy Davis of Carolina Boat fame who said, \\"The plyboard cold mold [in my Carolina Boats] was very much a Merritt influence. I was always impressed with both Merritt and Rybovich. If anyone tells you that we aren't influenced by Merritt and Rybovich, you're not getting the whole story.\\" Merritts built from 1968-1982 *Caliban (USCG #514085, Hull #17) was built in 1968 for Allen Merritt. The boat was notable because it helped Allen Merritt win seven out of 11 Cat Cay Tuna Tournaments - more than any captain in history. Cat Cay was where the tuna tower was invented and first used during the 1952 Cat Cay Tuna Tournament. The tournaments are no longer held. Caliban was later sold to Ralph Gilster, Jr. who named her Xiphias. This was the boat on which mate Larry Martin caught the 1,282-pound all-tackle Atlantic Blue Marlin record in 1977. Currently she is named Cat's Meow. *Caliban II (USCG #520624, Hull #18) was built for Capt. Buddy Merritt in 1969. Originally a single engine vessel, she was later converted to a twin screw. The boat was subsequently owned by Charlie Cipolla who named it the CMC. John E. Richardson and family purchased the boat in June 2001. She is now named the Picaflor and fishes the Pacific Coast of Panama from her berth in Balboa. *Caliban III (USCG #538469, Hull #19) was built for Roy's grandfather, F.R. Merritt Sr., in 1971. *Jane S. (USCG #547715, Hull #20) was built for George Scheigert in 1974. He was the first non-family member to commission a 43-footer. *Sansouri (USCG #558462, Hull #21) was built for Chris Weld in 1974. Once called the Buddy Boy, Today the boat is called the Nany, and spends it time fishing the waters off the Pacific Coast of Gauatemala. *Fighting Lady (USCG #555908, Hull #22) was Merritt's last frame boat, built in 1974 for Dinny Phipps. The Fighting Lady was the inspiration for the now popular color \\"fighting lady yellow\\" and was later owned by Joe Lopez. Lopez renamed the boat the Prowess and towed it around the world behind a mothership throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The boat now renamed Fighting Lady is owned and operated by Bart Sherwood, who runs frequently out of Miami, Florida. Despite its namesake color, the boat has been repainted seafoam green. *No Problem (Hull #23) was built for Jo Jo Del Guercio took delivery in 1975. A cold-molded hull, the boat included a lengthened deckhouse and raised sheer that improved exterior lines, interior layout and overall balance. The boat also had the first \\"rocket launcher,\\" (a device to hold fishing rods for trolling) an idea of Del Guercio's carried out by Merritt. Under the later name Cafi, the boat set a record for capturing the most white marlin in a day, a feat accomplished in 1983 off La Guaira Bank, Venezuela. The boat also caught the first 1,000-pound blue marlin off Venezuela with Capt. Ron Hamlin. The boat is now named the \\"Big Wednesday\\". *Cinco W (USCG #571432, Hull #24) was completed in 1976 for owner Pat Welder of Texas. *Snee Kee Peet (USCG #572858, Hull #25) was completed in 1976 for owner Pete Benoit. The Boat is now SeaJeannie and owned by Vito Costanza hailing from Montauk NY *Belama (USCG #580128, Hull #26) was completed in 1977 for owner Newt Belcher. Today the boat is called \\"Mistress\\" and shares her time between South Florida and Cape Cod. *Fighting Lady (USCG #604991, Hull #27) was Dinny Phipp's second 43, completed in 1978. *Cookie Too (USCG #646216) was the last 43 ever built, and one of the most famous. It was owned by the Murray Brothers, who are well known as makers of fine fighting chairs and other marine furniture. The Murray family later sold this boat to Johnny Morris, owner of Bass Pro Shops, who renamed her the Tracker. She is now owned by Scott Rhein of Montauk NY and has been renamed Jackpot. Merritt's Today Merritt's still produces new custom yachts today, although they are much larger than those built decades ago, over in length and with many amenities and construction methods unheard of in the 1960s. The rate of custom hand-crafted production is still very slow, at only one or two yachts built each year.

R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. (novels 1953-1955) (film series 2001-2003) Brego Brego the Horse belonged to King Th√©oden's son, Th√©odred, who had just been killed in a battle with Orcs. Aragorn speaks to Brego in Sindarin to quiet him. Aragorn says to √âowyn, \\"Turn this fellow free. He has seen enough of war.\\" This first scene between Aragorn and Brego appears only in the extended version of The Two Towers. Later, on the march to Helm's Deep, Aragorn is injured fighting Orcs on Wargs, falls off a cliff into a river, and is carried downstream. Brego then comes to the wounded Aragorn and lies down on the beach next to him so Aragorn can climb onto its back. He carries him the rest of the way to Helm's Deep. This side story does not exist in the book. Aragorn rides Brego in the charge out of Helm's Deep and to the Rohirrim camp at Dunharrow, but Brego runs away and refuses to enter the Paths of the Dead. It is unclear if the horse Aragorn rides to the Black Gate is Brego, though it has similar coloration. Brego is largely played by a bay Dutch Warmblood stallion named Uraeus. Before his movie career, Uraeus was an FEI dressage star. Ridden by his then-owner Lockie Richards, he won New Zealand National Dressage titles. Like Viggo Mortensen, who plays Aragorn, who was brought on board to replace a previously cast actor after the filming had already begun, Uraeus was brought out of semi-retirement to replace the horse previously cast as Brego, who turned out not to be adequate. At the end of the trilogy's filming, Mortensen had created such a strong bond with Uraeus that Richards agreed to sell the horse to him. Uraeus remains in New Zealand, looked after by Jane Abbott, one of the riding doubles who works on Peter Jackson's films. Uraeus had also a movie double, a horse named Brownie who was trained for the scene where Brego finds Aragorn injured on a river bank, rolls him over and lies down so that Aragorn can scramble onto his back. √âothain and Freda √âothain (played by Sam Comery) and Freda (played by Olivia Tennet) are young Rohirrim. They are sent by their mother Morwen (played by Robyn Malcolm) to alert Th√©oden that the \\"Wild Men\\" are raging through Rohan, burning villages. √âothain and Freda are kept at Edoras until they are reunited with their mother just before the battle at Helm's Deep. √âothain is named after a character in the book, one of √âomer's riders. The √âothain from Tolkien's novel The Two Towers was an adult member of √âomer‚Äôs √©ored that had overrun the Orcs who had captured Merry and Pippin, and later encountered Aragorn and his companions on the wide fields of Rohan. √âothain was not as trusting as his commander, scoffing at the idea that hobbits even existed, and arguing against the gift of horses to the three companions, especially Gimli. Figwit Figwit is the fan-derived name for an Elf extra (played by Bret McKenzie) who first appears at the Council of Elrond, and later on the path to the Grey Havens. Figwit (or McKenzie, rather) has his own fan following. The name is an acronym of the sentence/question \\"Frodo Is Great, Who Is That?\\", something reportedly said/thought by fans who saw the character for the first time in The Fellowship of the Ring film. Later, for the movie The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, Bret McKenzie was given the name Lindir in response to fans' desires to see \\"Figwit\\" return to screen. Haleth Haleth (played by Calum Gittins) son of H√°ma was among the boys who fought in the battle of Helm's Deep. His father was a member of the King's guard and doorward of Meduseld, who had been earlier killed by a Warg. Aragorn has a short inspirational talk with the boy. In the book, H√°ma is killed at Helm's Deep, and it is not mentioned if he has family. Tolkien uses the name Haleth for two characters of different sexes: a son of King Helm Hammerhand, who appears in the appendices of The Lord of the Rings, and a warrior-matriarch of the Edain in the First Age, who appears in The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales. Irolas Irolas informing Denethor about the apparent death of Faramir. Irolas (played by Ian Hughes) is an officer of Minas Tirith who appears after Faramir retreats from Osgiliath. He fights in the Battle of Minas Tirith. His name is derived from a variation of the name of the canonical Iorlas, an uncle of Bergil, a Gondorian boy whom Pippin befriends. This character was originally going to be Beregond, Bergil's father, who also befriends Pippin and is instrumental in saving Faramir from Denethor's funeral pyre, but according to the DVD commentary the role was so reduced that they felt it wasn't worth officially naming him \\"Beregond\\". Lurtz Lurtz is one of the main antagonists of the first film. He is the first of Saruman's Uruk-hai to be bred and is their leader at the time of the attack on the Fellowship of the Ring at Amon Hen. He kills Boromir in battle, piercing him in the torso with three arrows from a distance (in the book, Boromir is slain by \\"many arrows\\"). As he prepares to finish Boromir, Aragorn intervenes and engages him in battle. Though Lurtz puts up a good fight, Aragorn eventually severs his right arm and stabs him in the stomach. Lurtz pulls Aragorn's sword further into his own stomach in an attempt to reach and maul him, but Aragorn quickly decapitates Lurtz, finally killing him. Like Gothmog, he was played by New Zealand actor Lawrence Makoare. Lurtz's name is never spoken aloud in the film, and is only known from the credits, merchandise and DVD commentary. Madril Madril (played by John Bach) is one of the Rangers of Ithilien who appears in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. He serves as an advisor and second-in-command to Faramir during his missions to Ithilien and Osgiliath, playing a role vaguely similar to the characters of Mablung and Damrod from the books. Madril is amongst the Rangers of Ithilien who capture Frodo and Sam. He is seen discussing battle plans with Faramir, within the Ranger's hideout at Henneth Annun. When Faramir arrives to reinforce the garrison at Osgiliath, Madril reports the status of the city's defences. It is Madril who reminds Faramir that his life will be forfeited if he chooses to release Frodo and Sam, though Faramir still resolves to let them go. In the extended edition of The Two Towers, Madril is also seen in the background of a scene, in which Boromir and Faramir are celebrating their victory at Osgiliath. On the night of the assault on Osgiliath, Madril informs Faramir that he has sent scouts to Cair Andros to determine the activity of the Orcs in the North. However, the Rangers are caught unaware by the Orcs, who infiltrate Osgiliath with boats via the Anduin. Madril fights alongside Faramir in the battle, commanding a group of archers during the stand. Upon Madril's advice Faramir calls a retreat when it becomes clear that the Orcs are overrunning the city. While retreating from the city Madril is injured by an Orc while he is distracted by a Fell Beast, and is ultimately left behind whilst the other survivors escape to Minas Tirith. As he lies dying, Gothmog, the lieutenant of Minas Morgul, sees him upon the floor and cruelly impales him with a spear, killing him outright, before announcing to his army that the Age of Men is over. Madril's name has no Sindarin meaning since it is a transposition of the middle letters of Mardil Voronw√´, the first ruling Steward of Gondor. Morwen Morwen (played by Robyn Malcolm) is the mother of √âothain and Freda. She shares her name with two canonical characters ‚Äî Morwen, the wife of H√∫rin and mother of T√∫rin and Nienor, and Morwen Steelsheen, a Gondorian woman who married Thengel of Rohan and became the mother of Th√©oden. Sharku Sharku was the orc captain of Saruman's Warg Riders. He is played by the actor Jed Brophy. In the film, he and his fellow riders were unleashed by Saruman to attack the Rohirrim of Edoras while they were journeying to Helm's Deep. He dies when Aragorn stabs him in the throat while grabbing onto his warg. The wound gives him a slow death, where he tells Gimli and Legolas that Aragorn died. The Warg rider attack (as well as most of the circumstances and its aftermath) is an invention by the scriptwriters. In the book, Shark√ª is a name used for Saruman himself by his servants, meaning \\"old man\\". It is modified to \\"Sharkey\\" by his minions when they take over the Shire.

BVR facilitates the conversion of biliverdin to bilirubin via the reduction of a double-bond between the second and third pyrrole ring into a single-bond. There are two isozymes, in humans, each encoded by its own gene, biliverdin reductase A (BLVRA) and biliverdin reductase B (BLVRB).  Mechanism of catalysis  BVR acts on biliverdin by reducing its double-bond between the pyrrole rings into a single-bond. It accomplishes this using NADPH + H+ as an electron donor, forming bilirubin and NADP+ as products. BVR catalyzes this reaction through an overlapping binding site including Lys18, Lys22, Lys179, Arg183, and Arg185 as key residues. This binding site attaches to biliverdin, and causes its dissociation from heme oxygenase (HO) (which catalyzes reaction of ferric heme --> biliverdin), causing the subsequent reduction to bilirubin. { Reduction of biliverdin to bilirubin catalyzed by biliverdin reductase. }  Structure  BVR is composed of two closely packed domains, between 247-415 amino acids long and containing a Rossmann fold. BVR has also been determined to be a zinc-binding protein with each enzyme protein having one strong- binding zinc atom.; The C-terminal half of BVR contains the catalytic domain, which adopts a structure containing a six-stranded beta-sheet that is flanked on one face by several alpha-helices. This domain contains the catalytic active site, which reduces the gamma-methene bridge of the open tetrapyrrole, biliverdin IX alpha, to bilirubin with the concomitant oxidation of a NADH or NADPH cofactor.  Function  BVR works with the biliverdin/bilirubin redox cycle. It converts biliverdin to bilirubin (a strong antioxidant), which is then converted back into biliverdin through the actions of reactive oxygen species (ROS). This cycle allows for the neutralization of ROS, and the reuse of biliverdin products. Biliverdin also is replenished in the cycle with its formation from heme units through heme oxygenase (HO) localized from the endoplasmic reticulum. Bilirubin, being one of the last products of heme degradation in the liver, is further processed and excreted in bile after conjugation with glucuronic acid. In this way, BVR is essential in many mammals for the disposal of heme catabolites ‚Äì especially in the fetus where the placental membranes are bilirubin-permeable but not biliverdin-permeable - aiding in the removal of potentially toxic protein build-up. BVR has also more recently been recognized as a regulator of glucose metabolism and in cell growth and apoptosis control, due to its dual-specificity kinase character. This control over glucose metabolism indicates that BVR may play a role in pathogenesis of multiple metabolic diseases - the notable one being diabetes, by control of the upstream activator of insulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway.  Disease relevance  BVR acts as a means to regenerate bilirubin in a repeating redox cycle without significantly modifying the concentration of available bilirubin. With these levels maintained, it appears that BVR represents a new strategy for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and other types of oxidative stress-mediated diseases. The mechanism is due to the amplification of the potent antioxidant actions of bilirubin, as this can ameliorate free radical- mediated diseases. Studies have shown that the BVR redox cycle is essential in providing physiological cytoprotection. Genetic knock-outs and reduced BVR levels have demonstrated increased formation of ROS, and results in augmented cell death. Cells that experienced a 90% reduction in BVR experienced three times normal ROS levels. Through this protective and amplifying cycle, BVR allows low concentrations of bilirubin to overcome 10,000-fold higher concentrations of ROS.

At 122 metres (400 ft) it was the world's tallest stupa and the third tallest structure in the world when it was built by King Mahasena of Anuradhapura (273‚Äì301). He initiated the construction of the stupa following the destruction of the Mahavihara. His son Maghavanna I completed the construction of the stupa. A part of a sash or belt tied by the Buddha is believed to be the relic that is enshrined here. The structure is significant in the island's history as it represents the tensions within the Theravada and Mahayana sects of Buddhism; it is also significant in recorded history as one of the tallest structures in the ancient world;Silva, R. 1990, \\"Bricks ‚Äì A unit of construction in ancient Sri Lanka\\", ICTAD Journal, Vol.2, No. 1, pp. 21-42, Colombo. and the tallest non-pyramidal building; the height of the stupa was , making it the tallest stupa in the ancient world. With the destruction and abandonment of Anuradhapura kingdom in the 11th century, the stupa with others was covered by jungle. King Parakramabahu in 12th century tried to renovate this stupa and it was rebuilt to the current height, a reduction from the original height. Today it stands at . The structure is no longer the tallest, but it is still the largest, with a base-area of . Approximately 93.3 million baked bricks were used in its construction; the engineering ingenuity behind the construction of the structure is a significant development in the history of the island. The sectarian differences between the Buddhist monks also are represented by the stupa as it was built on the premises of the destroyed mahavihara, which led to a rebellion by a minister of King Mahasena. This stupa belongs to the Sagalika sect. The compound covers approximately 5.6 hectares and is estimated to have housed 10,000 Buddhist monks. One side of the stupa is long, and the flights of stairs at each of the four sides of it are wide. The doorpost to the shrine, which is situated in the courtyard, is high. The stupa has a deep foundation, and sits on bedrock. Stone inscriptions in the courtyard give the names of people who donated to the building effort.  Conception  Following king Jettha Tissa's death his brother Mahasena was consecrated as king by monk Sanghamitta, under the monk's influence king Mahasena brought about a campaign against Orthodox Theravadins dwelling in the mahavihara. The differences between the Theravadins and Mahayanins escalated to an extent to which a penalty was established to any person providing alms to monks dwelling in the mahavihara. The Mahavamsa quotes Sanghamitta: \\"The dwellers in the Mahavihara do not teach the (true) vinaya, we are those who teach the (true) vinaya, O king\\". The Mahavihara was eventually abandoned. The monks dwelling at the premises moved to Malaya Rata and Ruhuna, this followed by the pillaging of Mahavihara by Sanghamitta and minister Sona, all valuable were transferred to Abhayagiri vihƒÅra. The pillaging prompted a rebellion by minister Meghavannabhaya, the minister raised an army from Malaya and set camp by the Duratissaka tank. King Mahasena marches an army to meet minister Meghavannabhaya, where negotiations ensue the night before the battle and the king apologizes for the pillaging and agrees to build a vihara at the grounds of Mahavihara, the Mahavamsa quotes the king: \\" will make the vihara to be dwelt in yet again; forgive me my fault\\". Sanghamitta was assassinated by a laborer on the instructions of a wife of the king, following his demise and the construction of parivena by Meghavannabhaya marked the return of monks to the site of Mahavihara. Thus the construction of Jetavanaramaya began and offered to the monk Tissa, but the monk was accused of a grave offense upon investigation and proof by a minister, monk Tissa was disrobed and expelled from the order. The dakkinagiri monks were then entrusted with the premises of Jetavana Vihara. Design and construction Carving of a NƒÅgaraja (see NƒÅga) As the largest ancient stupa constructed and one of the tallest ancient structures in the world, the structural ingenuity and engineering skills employed for the construction are significant. The foundations of the structure were 8.5m deep and the size of the structure required bricks which could withstand loads of up to 166 kg. The solid foundation lay on bed-rock and the dome was constructed of full and half bricks and earth fill, the unique shape of a perfect ellipsoid allowed for stress and thus allowed the construction of the large structure. The Mahavamsa describes the foundation laying, where fissures were filled with stones and stamped down by elephants whose feet were protected with leather bindings. The bricks used for the construction were a significant development of ancient Sri Lankan engineering, the bricks used for Jetavanaramaya had a composition of 60 percent fine sand and 35 percent clay, the bricks could withstand . Linear elastic finite element analysis under self weight produced a maximum compressive stress of at the bottom centre, thus the maximum stress in the dome is ten times less than what the bricks could withstand.Ranaweera, M.P, 2000, \\"Some structural analyses related to the conservation of Jetavana Stupa\\", Proceedings of Engineering Jubilee Congress, University of Peradeniya. Finely crushed dolomite, limestone, sieved sand and clay provided the bonding material for the bricks. The clay employed was pliable and thus accommodates movement within the structure. One of the sides of the brick was roughened to trap the bonding slurry thus limiting lateral movement. The stupa was then covered with lime plaster; the plaster used contained seashells, sugar syrup, egg whites, coconut water, glues, oils, plant resin, sand, clay and pebbles. The plaster also provided waterproofing for the structure. The Mahavamsa also mentions the use of copper sheets over the foundation and arsenic dissolved in sesame oil to prevent insect and plant intrusions inside the stupa. It is estimated that Jetavanaramaya took 15 years to complete and would have required a skillful workforce of hundreds, including brickyard workers and bricklayers, and stonemasons. Late history Carvings at Jetavanaramya The Jetavanaramaya was under the monks of the Sagalika sect. The Sagalica sect was closely linked with the Abhyagiri viharaya. Towards the end of the Anuradhapura period, Jetavana had developed into one of the three fraternities of the island along with Mahavihara and Abhyagiriya. The fraternities were united during the reign of King Parakramabahu I. A pasada constructed by King Sena I was destroyed by fire. King Agghabodhi VI constructed and added a new pasada. Chola invaders during the reign of king Udaya IV destroyed the gold images of Buddha by King Sena. Repairs were completed by King Mahendra IV. Juma, a Sri Lankan merchant, presented King Silakala with a Mahayana book Dhammadatu brought from Benares. King Silakala held a festival annually in celebration of Dhammadatu. Monks of Mahavihara have boycotted the festivals, citing the Mahayana origins of the book, but were later persuaded by Abhayagiri monks to participate in the festivities. The leadership of the Mahavihara was later accepted during the reign of King Aggabodhi I, following the defeat of a public debate between the monks. Conservation Carvings at Jetavanaramya Until 1909 the colossal structure was covered with shrub jungle. Monk Kumbuke Dhammarama of Sailabimbaramaya temple of Gammanpita received approval to clear the stupa and the court from the Atamasthana committee. The approval was subsequently canceled as the monk decided to settle down. Palannaruwe Sobita thereto sought and received permission to continue clearing the premises but approval was once again canceled when the monk initiated the collection of contributions. However, the monk refused to leave; in the legal procedures which ensued he was forced to leave. Conservation work has been funded by the income from ticket sales, mainly to foreign tourists to the three cultural triangle sites of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya. Bricks were burned using the same kind of mixture that was used by the builders of the original dagoba. Excavations have revealed artifacts indicating that Sri Lanka was the primary entrepot for trade activity connecting the Indian rim countries as well as the Mediterranean and the Far East, and artistic influences that point to a shared culture in South Asia.

Phascolarctos stirtoni was about one third larger than the contemporary koala, P. cinereus, and has had an estimated weight of , which is the same weight as a large contemporary male koala. Although considered a part of the Australian megafauna, its body mass excludes it from most formal definitions of megafauna. It is better described as a more robust koala, rather than a \\"giant\\"; in contrast, a number of Australian megafauna, such as Diprotodon and Procoptodon goliah, were unambiguously giants. The two koala species co- existed during the Pleistocene, occupying the same arboreal niche. The reason for the extinction of the larger of the two about 50,000 years ago is unknown, although there are various hypotheses for the extinction. Description The giant koala was an arboreal marsupial weighing about 13 kg, a little more than modern koalas. It is the largest known tree dwelling marsupial ever to have lived. Scientists say there is a clear similarity between the physical appearance of P. stirtoni and the modern koala. It is assumed that the giant koala was a folivore which was specialised to feed on eucalyptus leaves, like its extant relative. Extinction Fossil remains of P. stirtoni have been discovered in Lake Eyre and Lake Tarkarooloo basins in South Australia.http://www.artistwd.com/joyaustralia/articles/megafauna/phascolarctos_stirtoni.php#.VmWMU7grKUk It was once thought that the modern-day koala was descended from the giant koala, but this has now been determined to be incorrect. Gilbert Price, of the University of Queensland, used improved dating techniques to analyse fossils of both types of koala to find that the two species were living together in the same arboreal niche. It is unclear from what the koalas descend and why one species survived while the other became extinct. It is hypothesized that there was a change in climate and a restriction of food supply. Another possible reason is the hunting by humans for larger animals. The \\"dwarfing\\" hypothesis, based on the similarities of the two koalas has been used to support both ideas.

History =Formation= Don Christie, former President of the Society, in 2009 NZOSS was formed in February 2003, after David Lane wrote an open letter suggesting the use of open source software in Government in 2002, co-signed by over four hundred New Zealanders. Peter Harrison then suggested that a national organisation be formed to promote and advocate use of open-source software, via the New Zealand Linux Users Group. This led to several meetings throughout New Zealand in 2002 and 2003, and finally resulted in the NZOSS being formed as a formal incorporated society on 27 February 2003. Since this time the NZOSS has been involved with various efforts to promote open source in government, including participation with the Ministry of Economic Development's Authentication Project, and later a report on the State Services Commission guidelines on the legal issues of open-source software. =Current operation= The society has an active mailing list known as 'OpenChat', which is open to participation from anyone with an interest in free/open source software (F/OSS) and the business of the Society. Membership of the society is required for voting rights, and helps sustain the Society, but is not required in order to be active in NZOSS discussions and activities. Campaigns = Patent action = In 2005 the NZOSS formally objected to a New Zealand Patent 525484, a patent for \\"Word-processing document stored in a single XML file that may be manipulated by applications that understand XML\\". The opposition was based on evidence cited by the United States Patent and Trademark Office who rejected the patent in the United States. The NZOSS withdrew their opposition in August 2006 as a consequence of Microsoft significantly amending the patent such that Abiword would no longer constitute prior use or prior publication. In 2009 the NZOSS made a submission to the Commerce Select Committee considering the Patent Bill before Parliament. The submission proposed that software be excluded from being patentable. The Commerce Select Committee agreed with the submission, excluding software from patents. Minister Simon Power has publicly stated that he supports the decision of the Commerce Select Committee. = Copyright legislation = During 2008 and 2009 the NZOSS and its members were vocal in their opposition to the Anti Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA), and in proposed changes to New Zealand copyright law (notably Section 92A of the Copyright (New Technologies) Amendment Act 2008. NZOSS have spoken with Members of Parliament and made submissions to the select committee involved. = Use of free and open-source software in Government = In August 2009 the Society announced the launch of the Public Sector Remix project to demonstrate the viability of free open- source software on public sector desktops. A number of central, regional and local government agencies worked together with the Society to run trials using free software for common desktop tasks.  New Zealand Open Source Awards  The 2014 New Zealand Open Source Awards, held at Te Papa in Wellington The inaugural New Zealand Open Source Awards were held in 2007, with the Society involved in both organisation and sponsorship. These awards now run bi- annually and serve to showcase the contributions of New Zealanders directly to open-source projects or the promotion of open source generally, as well as exemplary use of open source by New Zealand organisations. The Awards help to raise awareness of the open-source advantage for New Zealand by telling some powerful success stories based on real achievements. Then awards were held again in 2008 and have run biennially since then. The most recent awards were held at Te Papa Tongarewa on 23 October 2018.

He won 202 games in the third-longest tenure ever for a XU coach. He was the winningest coach in XU history until Chris Mack passed him in 2018. Following his success at Xavier, Gillen was hired at Providence to replace Rick Barnes, who had left to coach Clemson University. He followed PC's 1994 Big East title with two trips to the NIT before the Friars' 1997 run to the Elite Eight, upsetting Marquette and Duke and beating Chattanooga before losing in overtime to eventual national champion Arizona. Following a tough 1997‚Äì98 year, where he lost four starters (three to graduation, and one (God Shammgod) to the NBA draft), Gillen moved on, replacing Jeff Jones at Virginia, who resigned on March 15, 1998 after eight years as the Cavaliers‚Äô head coach. Gillen's seven Virginia teams compiled an overall record of 118‚Äì93 and competed in five postseason tournaments. The Cavaliers participated in the 2001 NCAA Tournament and in the National Invitation Tournament four times. He resigned after the 2004‚Äì05 season. Gillen was notorious for his philosophy of expeditiously calling timeouts as he felt needed ‚Äì routinely using most, if not all, of his teams' allotted timeouts in the first half of games. In September 2008, Gillen was inducted into the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame along with NBA stars Kenny Anderson, Sam Perkins and Rod Strickland, and pioneers Lou Bender and Eddie Younger.Mallozzi, Vincent M. \\"City‚Äôs Basketball Hall Welcomes 98-Year-Old Inductee\\", The New York Times, September 17, 2008.

The council was attended by thirty-two bishops, including four metropolitans, from across Gaul, and together they passed thirty-one decrees.John Michael Wallace-Hadrill, The Frankish Church (Oxford, 1983), p. 95.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, pp. 99-103. The bishops met at Orl√©ans to reform the church and construct a strong relationship between the crown and the Catholic episcopate, the majority of the canons reflecting compromise between these two institutions. The 511 Council of Orl√©ans was the first national Merovingian church council. It was an important milestone in creating a unified Gallic Church under Frankish rule, and accordingly the matters addressed at the council reflected the concerns of the Catholic episcopate in this new political context.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 7. The council established a Merovingian conciliar tradition, being the first of ‚Äòno less than forty-five provincial and national Church councils‚Äô in the sixth century.Yitzhak Hen, ‚ÄòThe Church in Sixth-Century Gaul‚Äô, in A. C. Murray (ed.), A Companion to Gregory of Tours (Leiden, 2016), p. 243.  Attendees  Attending Bishops Although Clovis convoked the council, he was not present in Orl√©ans when the bishops met.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 7. Of the thirty-two attending bishops, approximately two-thirds were from northern Gaul and the remaining third from the south.Gregory Halfond, ‚ÄòVouill√©, Orl√©ans (511), and the Origins of the Frankish Conciliar Tradition‚Äô, in R. W. Mathisen and D. Shanzer (eds), The Battle of Vouill√©, 507 CE: Where France Began (Berlin, 2012), p. 158. The provinces represented at Orl√©ans were Bordeaux, Bourges, √âauze, Tours, Rouen, Sens, and Rheims.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 223. However, it was Cyprian of Bordeaux, a southern bishop, who presided over the council.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 7. Halfond proposes that Clovis chose Cyprian as president in acknowledgement of the ‚Äòlong-established spiritual and pastoral authority‚Äô of the southern bishops, and their association with conciliar tradition.Halfond, ‚ÄòVouill√©, Orl√©ans (511), and the Origins of the Frankish Conciliar Tradition‚Äô, p. 158. Halfond further argues that Clovis purposely elected to represent cities recently integrated into his kingdom, including newly appointed northern bishops and the Aquitanian bishops previously under Visigothic rule. Halfond refers to the council‚Äôs episcopal subscriptions to support this. The bishops are listed in order of seniority, so the subscriptions shows that many of the northern bishops were the most recently appointed.Halfond, ‚ÄòVouill√©, Orl√©ans (511), and the Origins of the Frankish Conciliar Tradition‚Äô, pp. 157-8.  Location  Map of Frankish Gaul in 511, showing the location of Orl√©ans.For the location of his synod, Clovis chose the civitas of Orl√©ans, located in north-central Gaul, on the Loire River. Its central location allowed for accessibility, and its status as a frontier city between Clovis‚Äô kingdom and the newly conquered Visigothic territory gave the location significance.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 7. In 511 Orl√©ans had no import in Gallic conciliar affairs, but over the Merovingian period was to become a prominent meeting place for national church councils.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 7. Four further councils took place in Orl√©ans in the sixth century.  Clovis and the context of Vouill√©  = Clovis' involvement in the council = Clovis was not present at the council, but the attending bishops wrote a letter to him following the council to inform him of the proceedings and seek his approval. The letter references ‚Äòall the bishops‚Äô that Clovis ordered to be present, indicating that Clovis controlled attendance.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, p. 99. Further, the letter references ‚Äòheadings‚Äô that Clovis gave the bishops to discuss, indicating that Clovis had some influence on the proceedings of the council.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, p. 99. Clovis‚Äô convocation of the council was partially an act of imitatio imperii following in the Constantinian tradition, Constantine having called the First Council of Nicaea in 325.Edward James, The Origins of France: From Clovis to the Capetians, 500-1000 (London, 1982), pp. 29-30.Hen, ‚ÄòThe Church in Sixth- Century Gaul‚Äô, p. 243. = Precedent of Agde = However, there was also the more immediate precedent of the Council of Agde, convoked by Alaric in 506. Although Alaric was an Arian, he had assembled Roman bishops together. Clovis, as a Nicene Christian, was aware of this and thus the need to call a Frankish synod. Agde and Orl√©ans shared both attendees and legislative concerns. Halfond has argued that issues from Agde were raised at Orl√©ans with the specific aim of addressing concerns of the Aquitanian bishops who were new to Frankish rule.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, pp. 187-8. = Context of Vouill√© and the Visigothic defeat = Clovis convened the First Council of Orl√©ans shortly before his death in 511, in the context of his recent defeat of the Visigoths in 507 at the Battle of Vouill√©. Alaric II‚Äôs territory in Aquitaine was thus taken over by Clovis.Gregory of Tours, Histories, II.37. This created the practical issue of integrating the Visigothic episcopate. There has been historiographical debate over the impact the Visigothic defeat had on Clovis‚Äô convocation of the council. Daly has argued against the importance of the Visigothic wars, arguing that the council did not have an ‚ÄòAquitanian focus‚Äô.William M. Daly, ‚ÄòClovis: How Barbaric, How Pagan?‚Äô, Speculum 69 (1994), p. 658. Wallace-Hadrill questions the importance of Vouill√©, considering that the council did not occur until four years after the Visigothic defeat. However, he contends that the primary purpose of the council was to deal with property of the Aquitanian churches following the Frankish conquest.John Michael Wallace-Hadrill, The Long-Haired Kings (Toronto, 1982), p. 177.Wallace-Hadrill, The Frankish Church (Oxford, 1983), p. 96. Historical consensus attributes some degree of significance to the Visigothic context, Halfond and James both proposing that the council was focused on the regulation of episcopal affairs in light of the expanded Frankish territory.James, The Origins of France, pp. 29-30.Halfond, ‚ÄòVouill√©, Orl√©ans (511), and the Origins of the Frankish Conciliar Tradition‚Äô, p. 153.  Creed  The thirty-one decrees of the First Council of Orl√©ans addressed ecclesiastical and royal concerns, although their respective concerns often intersected. The first ten canons, but specifically 4-7, are likely an answer to the royal questionnaire. The council was particularly focused upon episcopal authority, while it also regulated clerical and monastic life, concerning issues of property, crime, and relations with women. It covered some liturgical issues concerning mass, feasts, and fasting. Penitents and the laity were only briefly discussed.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, p. 98. Some of the most pertinent issues that arose were: = Sanctuary = The opening canons cover matters of sanctuary in church. The canons cover a range of scenarios, namely concerning criminals (c.1), abductors (c.2), and slaves (c.3). In the case of ‚Äòmurderers, adulterers, and thieves‚Äô seeking sanctuary in the church, the bishops ruled that the ecclesiastical canons and Roman law should be followed, meaning ‚Äòit should not be permitted‚Äô to remove them from the church, nor hand them over unless an oath is sworn promising no harm.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 1-3. = Clerical immunity = Canon five addresses ‚Äòofferings or lands‚Äô which the King has gifted to the Church.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 5. Historians have argued this could reflect the context of distributing Visigothic land and property.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, pp. 110-11. It is decreed that royal gifts were to be immune from taxation, but were to be directed into church maintenance, supporting the bishops, and aiding the poor and prisoners through alms.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 5. = Converted clerics = Canon ten addresses ‚Äòheretical clerics‚Äô, specifically dealing with Arian clerics following the Frankish gain of Visigothic territory. It is decreed that if these clerics ‚Äòentirely accept‚Äô Catholicism, they are permitted to join the ranks of the Catholic clergy in whatever role their bishop decides appropriate.‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 10. = Episcopal authority = A number of the canons are constructed to determine the boundaries of a bishop‚Äôs authority. Notably, the authority of a bishop over their clergy is asserted (c.7, c.28). The canons also address episcopal control over church offerings and the bishop‚Äôs duty to distribute among the ‚Äòpoor or sick‚Äô (c.14-16). It is decreed that abbots are to be ‚Äòunder the control of bishops‚Äô and are to be punished by the bishops if they oppose their Rule (c.19).‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 7, 14-16, 19, 28. Within this, the boundaries of secular and episcopal authority are discussed, as per Clovis‚Äô agenda. It is decreed that laymen are not to be ordained, unless commanded so by the king or with the consent of the judge (c.4).‚ÄòOrl√©ans, 511‚Äô, c. 4.  Significance  As the First Council of Orl√©ans was the first national Merovingian church council, it acted as a model for future Frankish councils. Its canons had longevity, as nearly all of them were preserved in Merovingian and Carolingian canonical compilations.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, pp. 168-70, 190. The First Council of Orl√©ans established a precedent for Frankish kings‚Äô involvement in ecclesiastical councils. Clovis established a standard for ‚Äòassociating royal power with the enforcement of conciliar decisions‚Äô. From Orl√©ans, a tradition of ‚Äòmutual recognition‚Äô developed between crown and church, wherein both recognised the importance of the other in managing ecclesiastical affairs.Halfond, The Archaeology of Frankish Church Councils, p. 146.

In organic chemistry, the anomeric effect or Edward-Lemieux effect is a stereoelectronic effect that describes the tendency of heteroatomic substituents adjacent to a heteroatom within a cyclohexane ring to prefer the axial orientation instead of the less hindered equatorial orientation that would be expected from steric considerations. This effect was originally observed in pyranose rings by J. T. Edward in 1955 when studying carbohydrate chemistry. The term anomeric effect was introduced in 1958. The name comes from the term used to designate the lowest-numbered ring carbon of a pyranose, the anomeric carbon. Isomers that differ only in the configuration at the anomeric carbon are called anomers. The anomers of D-glucopyranose are diastereomers, with the beta anomer having an OH group pointing up equatorially, and the alpha anomer having that OH group pointing down axially. The anomeric effect can also be generalized to any cyclohexyl or linear system with the general formula C-Y-C-X, where Y is a heteroatom with one or more lone pairs, and X is an electronegative atom or group. The magnitude of the anomeric effect is estimated at about 1‚Äì2 kcal/mol in the case of sugars, but is different for every molecule. 377px In the above case, the methoxy group on the cyclohexane ring (top) prefers the equatorial position. However, in the tetrahydropyran ring (bottom), the methoxy group prefers the axial position. This is because in the cyclohexane ring, Y= carbon, which is not a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect is not observed and sterics dominates the observed substituent position. In the tetrahydropyran ring, Y= oxygen, which is a heteroatom, so the anomeric effect contributes and stabilizes the observed substituent position. In both cases, X= OMe. The anomeric effect is most often observed when Y= oxygen, but can also be seen with other lone pair bearing heteroatoms in the ring, such as nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The exact method by which the anomeric effect causes stabilization is a point of controversy, and several hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. Physical explanation and controversy The physical reason for the anomeric effect is not completely understood. Several, in part conflicting, explanations have been offered and the topic is still not settled. =Hyperconjugation= Cyclic molecules A widely accepted explanation is that there is a stabilizing interaction (hyperconjugation) between the unshared electron pair on the endocyclic heteroatom (within the sugar ring) and the œÉ* orbital of the axial (exocyclic) C‚ÄìX bond. This causes the molecule to align the donating lone pair of electrons antiperiplanar (180¬∞) to the exocyclic C-X œÉ bond, lowering the overall energy of the system and causing more stability. 377px Some authors also question the validity of this hyperconjugation model based on results from the quantum theory of atoms in molecules. While most studies on the anomeric effects have been theoretical in nature, the n‚ÄìœÉ* (hyperconjugation) hypothesis has also been extensively criticized on the basis that the electron density redistribution in acetals proposed by this hypothesis is not congruent with the known experimental chemistry of acetals and, in particular, the chemistry of monosaccharides. Acyclic molecules Hyperconjugation is also found in acyclic molecules containing heteroatoms, another form of the anomeric effect. If a molecule has an atom with a lone pair of electrons and the adjacent atom is able to accept electrons into the œÉ* orbital, hyperconjugation occurs, stabilizing the molecule. This forms a \\"no bond\\" resonance form. For this orbital overlap to occur, the trans, trans conformation is preferred for most heteroatoms, however for the stabilization to occur in dimethoxymethane, the gauche, gauche conformation is about 3‚Äì5 kcal/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the trans,trans conformation‚Äîthis is about two times as big as the effect in sugars because there are two rotatable bonds (hence it is trans around both bonds or gauche around both) that are affected. 377px =Dipole minimization= Another accepted explanation for the anomeric effect is the equatorial configuration has the dipoles involving both heteroatoms partially aligned, and therefore repelling each other. By contrast the axial configuration has these dipoles roughly opposing, thus representing a more stable and lower energy state. 434px Both the hyperconjugation and the dipole minimization contribute to the preferred (Z)-conformation of esters over the (E)-conformation. In the (Z) conformation the lone pair of electrons in the alpha oxygen can donate into the neighboring œÉ* C-O orbital. In addition, the dipole is minimized in the (Z)-conformation and maximized in the (E)-conformation. 377px =n-n repulsions and C-H hydrogen bonding= If the lone pairs of electrons on the oxygens at the anomeric center of 2-methoxypyran are shown, then a brief examination of the conformations of the anomers reveal that the Œ≤-anomer always has at least one pair of eclipsing (coplanar 1,3-interacting) lone pairs, this n-n repulsion is a high energy situation. On the other hand, the Œ±-anomer has conformations in which there are no n-n repulsions, and that is true in the exo-anomeric conformation. The energetically unfavourable n-n repulsion present in the Œ≤-anomer, coupled with the energetically favourable hydrogen bond between the axial H-5 and a lone pair of electrons on the axial Œ±-anomeric substituent (C-H/n hydrogen bond), have been suggested [references 7 and 8] to account for most of the energetic difference between the anomers, the anomeric effect. The molecular mechanics program StruMM3D, which is not specially parameterized for the anomeric effect, estimates that the dipolar contributions to the anomeric effect (primarily the n-n repulsion, and C-H hydrogen bonding discussed above) are about 1.5 kcal/mol. Influences While the anomeric effect is a general explanation for this type of stabilization for a molecule, the type and amount of stabilization can be affected by the substituents being examined as well as the solvent being studied. =Substituent effect= In a closed system, there is a difference observed in the anomeric effect for different substituents on a cyclohexane or tetrahydropyran ring (Y=Oxygen). When X=OH, the generic anomeric effect can be seen, as previously explained. When X=CN, the same results are seen, where the equatorial position is preferred on the cyclohexane ring, but the axial position is preferred on the tetrahydropyran ring. This is consistent with the anomeric effect stabilization. When X=F, the anomeric effect is in fact observed for both rings. However, when X=NH2, no anomeric effect stabilization is observed and both systems prefer the equatorial position. This is attributed to both sterics and an effect called the reverse anomeric effect (see below). =Solvent effect= One common criticism of the hyperconjugation theory is that it fails to explain why the anomeric effect is not observed when substituted tetrahydropyran molecules are placed in polar solvents, and the equatorial position is once again preferred. It has been shown, however, that hyperconjugation does depend on the solvent in the system. Each of the substituted systems described above were tested in the gas phase (i.e. with no solvent) and in aqueous solution (i.e. polar solvent). When X=F, the anomeric effect was observed in both media, and the axial position was always preferred. This is attributed to hyperconjugation. When X=OH or CN, the anomeric effect was seen in the gas phase, when the axial position was preferred. However, in aqueous solutions, both substituents preferred the equatorial position. This is attributed to the fact that there are more electrostatic repulsions with the axial positioned substituent and the polar solvent, causing the equatorial position to be preferred. When X=NH2, again, no anomeric effect was observed and the equatorial position was always preferred. =Overcoming the anomeric effect= While the anomeric effect can cause stabilization of molecules, it does have a magnitude to its stabilization, and this value can be overcome by other, more destabilizing effects in some cases. 377px In the example of spiroketals, the orientation on the upper left shows stabilization by the hyperconjugative anomeric effect twice, thus greatly stabilizing the orientation of the molecule. The orientation on the upper right only shows this hyperconjugative anomeric stabilization once, causing it to be the lesser preferred structure. However, when substituent are added onto the spiroketal backbone, the more preferred structure can be changed. When a large substituent is added to the spiroketal backbone, as seen in the lower left, the strain from having this large substituent, R, in the axial position is greatly destabilizing to the molecule. In the molecule on the lower right, R is now in the equatorial position, which no longer causes destabilization on the molecule. Therefore, without substituents, the upper equilibrium reaction is favored on the left hand side, while the lower equilibrium is favored on the right hand side, simply from the addition of a large, destabilizing substituent. Exo anomeric effect An extension of the anomeric effect, the exo anomeric effect is the preference of substituents coming off a ring to adopt the gauche conformation, while sterics would suggest an antiperiplanar conformation would be preferred. 433px An example of this is 2-methoxytetrahydropyran. As the anomeric effect predicts, the methoxy substituent shows an increased preference for the axial conformation. However, there is actually more than one possible axial conformation due to rotation about the C-O bond between the methoxy substituent and the ring. When one applies the principles of the reverse anomeric effect, it can be predicted that the gauche conformer is preferred, suggesting the top left conformation is best in the figure above. This prediction is supported by experimental evidence. Furthermore, this preference for the gauche position is still seen in the equatorial conformation. Reverse anomeric effect This term refers to the apparent preference of positively charged nitrogen substituents for the equatorial conformation beyond what normal steric interactions would predict in rings containing an electronegative atom, such as oxygen. Substituents containing carbons with partial positive charges are not seen to exhibit the same effect. Theoretical explanations for the reverse anomeric effect include an electrostatic explanation and the delocalization of the sp3 electrons of the anomeric carbon and oxygen lone pair. There is some debate as to whether or not this is a real phenomenon. The nitrogen containing substituents it has been reported with are quite bulky, making it hard to separate the normal effects of steric bulk and the reverse anomeric effect, if it does exist. For example, in the molecule shown below, the pyridinium substituent strongly prefers the equatorial position, as steric factors would predict, but actually shows a stronger preference for this conformation than predicted, suggesting the reverse anomeric effect is contributing. 433px Metallo-anomeric effect Late transition metals from groups 10, 11, and 12 when placed at the anomeric carbon show strong axial preferences. This phenomenon termed as the metallo- anomeric effect originates from stabilizing hyperconjugative interactions between oxygen or other heteroatoms with lone pairs and C-M anti-bonding orbitals that act as good acceptors. The generalized metallo-anomeric effect refers to thermodynamic stabilization of synclinal conformers of compounds with the general formula M-CH2-OR. Axial/equatorial preferences can be influenced by ligands attached to the metal and electronic configuration. In general terms, moving from a lighter to a heavier element in the group, the magnitude of the metallo-anomeric effect increases. Furthermore, higher oxidation states favor axial/synclinal conformers. Synthetic applications The anomeric effect is taken into consideration synthetically. Due to its discovery in sugars, sugar and carbohydrate chemistry is one of the more common synthetic uses of the anomeric effect. For instance, the Koenigs-Knorr glycosidation installs an Œ±-OR or Œ≤-OR group in high diastereoselectivity which is effected by the anomeric effect. Sophorolipid lactone, (+)-Lepicidin A, and (‚àí)-Lithospermoside are a few of the products synthesized via the Koenigs-Knorr Glycosidation overcoming the anomeric effect. 700px See also *Alkane stereochemistry *Anomer *Carbohydrate conformation *Conformational isomerism *Cyclohexane conformation *Gauche effect *Intramolecular forces *Monosaccharide *Raymond Lemieux *Steric effects References External links * Category:Carbohydrate chemistry Category:Physical organic chemistry Category:Carbohydrates Category:Acetals ","title":"Anomeric effect"},{"id":"3901789","text":"Tony Kemp (born 18 January 1968) is a New Zealand former rugby league test representative and former coach of the New Zealand Warriors.

This type of learning teaches students to examine their experiences from the human rights point of view enabling them to integrate these concepts into their values and decision-making. According to Amnesty International, human rights education is a way to empower people so that they can create skills and behavior that would promote dignity and equality within the community, society, and all over the world.  Non-discrimination  The \\"National Economics and Social Rights Initiative\\" stated the importance of Non-Discrimination in Human Rights Education. Governments must see to it that it must be exercised without bias to race, gender, color, religion, language, national or social origin, political or personal opinion, birth, or any status. All students, parents, and communities possess the right to take part in decisions affecting their respective schools and the right to education.  Human rights education and training  The OHCHR promotes Human Rights Education by supporting national and local initiatives for HRE within the context of its Technical Cooperation Programs and through the ACT Project which subsidizes the grassroots projects. The ACT or Assisting Communities Together Project is the collaboration between the OHCHR and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) to make grants available for civil society organizations in implementing human rights activities in local communities. The OHCHR also develops preferred Human Rights Education training materials and resource tools such as the Database on Human Rights Education and Training, Resource Collection on Human Rights Education and Training, and web section on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Finally, it takes care of coordinating the World Program for Human Rights Education. = Universal Declaration of Human Rights = The \\"Universal Declaration of Human Rights\\" is acknowledged as a landmark document in human rights history. It was drafted by representatives from various countries and regions with varying legal and cultural experiences. The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed this declaration in Paris, France, on 10 December 1948. This Declaration states that basic human rights require protection. It was translated into more than 500 languages worldwide.  Demand for human rights education  The demand for human rights education continues to grow globally. Academic institutions are in the position to train students as future business leaders capable of managing human rights impact on their respective corporate organizations. The United Nations Global Compact in cooperation with the Principles for Responsible Management Education invites different corporations to incorporate business along with human rights topics to their curricula. The Asia-Pacific Center for Education for International Understanding and the United Nations Academic Impact mutually organized the 2018 United Nations Global Citizenship Education Seminar at the UN Headquarters in New York City. These seminars are useful in the formulation of new ideas and concepts related to HRE. Human Rights Education is crucial because it is one of the keys to making governments and political leaders accountable. It also imparts and spreads out the human rights vocabulary and provides a critical approach towards human rights. Human rights education and the United Nations The United Nations High Commissioner for the Promotion and Protection of all Human Rights functions as coordinator of the UN Education and Public Information Programs in the area of human rights. The United Nations General Assembly has proclaimed it as central to the achievement of the rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR): Article 26.2 of the UDHR states the role of educators in achieving the social order called for by the declaration: Article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child requires states to ensure that children are enabled to develop a respect for their own cultural identity, language and values and for the culture, language and values of others.Murphy, Ruane (2003) The importance of human rights was reaffirmed by the United Nations in the 1993 Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action: As a result of the Vienna Declaration the decade from 1995 to 2004 was declared the UN Decade of Human Rights Education.General Assembly resolution 49/184 of 23 December 1994 UNESCO has a responsibility to promote human rights education, and was a key organiser of the UN's Decade for Human Rights Education. UNESCO attempts to promote human rights education through: * Development of national and local capacities for human rights education, through its co-operation in development projects and programmes at national and sub-regional levels. * Elaboration of learning materials and publications and their translation and adaptation in national and local languages. * Advocacy and Networking Activities. Following the Decade of Human Rights Education, on 10 December 2004, the General Assembly proclaimed the World Programme for Human Rights Education, and ongoing project to advance the implementation of human rights education programmes in all sectors: Human rights education history The emphasis on Human Rights Education began in 1995 with the beginning of the UN Decade for Human Rights Education, though previously addressed in 1953 with the UNESCO Associated Schools Program, which served as an \\"initial attempt to teach human rights in formal school settings\\". The first formal request for the need to educate students about human rights came about in UNESCO‚Äôs 1974 article Recommendation concerning Education for International Understanding, Cooperation and Peace, and Education Relating to Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The participants of the International Congress on the Teaching of Humans Rights eventually met in 1978 to form a specific definition of what would be required application of the education in formal curricula. The aims at which the Congress agreed upon including the encouragement of tolerant attitudes with focus on respect, providing knowledge of human rights in the context of national and international dimensions as well as their implementations, and finally developing awareness of human rights translating into reality whether social or political on national and international levels. Human Rights Education became an official central concern internationally after the World Conference on Human Rights in 1993. This conference brought the issue of educating formally to the top of many countries' priority lists and was brought to the attention of the United Nations. It was two years later that the United Nations approved the Decade for Human Rights Education, which reformed the aims of application once again. Since the development of the UN Decade, the incorporation of human rights education into formal school curricula has been developed and diversified with the assistance of nongovernmental organizations, intergovernmental organizations, and individuals dedicated to spreading the topic through formal education. Today the most influential document used to determine what qualifies as human rights and how to implement these ideas and rights into everyday life is the Universal Declaration. The declaration was adopted by the General Assembly in 1948, making 10 December annual Human Rights Day ever since. To this day the 30 article compilation is seen as \\"a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations\\".

Values and awareness The Values and Awareness Model focuses on transmitting \\"basic knowledge of human rights issues and to foster its integration into public values\\" based on its philosophical-historical approach. This model is what people commonly think of when human rights are concerned with the target audience being the general public with topics including global human rights and more cultural based matters. 2\\\\. Accountability The Accountability Model is associated with the legal and political approach to human rights in which the learners which the model targets are already involved via professional roles. The model is incorporated by means of training and networking, covering topics such as court cases, codes of ethics, and how to deal with the media. 3\\\\. Transformational This model of education focuses on the psychological and sociological aspects of human rights. The topics towards which this model is effective are those including vulnerable populations and people with personal experiences effected by the topic, such as women and minorities. The model aims to empower the individual, such as those victims of abuse and trauma. The model is geared towards recognizing the abuse of human rights but is also committed to preventing these abuses.\\"Understanding what we do: emerging models for human rights education by Felisa Tibbitts International Review of Education volume 48, numbers 3-4, pgs 159-171\\" Criticism Sudbury model of democratic education schools maintain that values, human rights included, must be learned through experienceGreenberg, D.

It was launched on July 4, 2005. The first strip is dated June 27 because Martin launched the site with a week's backlog of strips. The setting is Antarctica, where Wallace \\"Wally\\" Fitzgerald McGillicutty, the displaced polar bear, and his long-suffering friend Osborne, an adelie penguin (the spelling was later changed to Osborne from Osbourne, as reflected in the new title), have many comic misadventures. It is not clear how or why Wally, an Arctic polar bear, ended up in Antarctica, although Osborne suggested it might be due to bipolar disorder. The comic uses a newspaper-style format with occasional bigger \\"Sunday strips\\". It is in color with a limited palette consisting of flat areas of black, white, blue and orange. This color scheme was followed through in the original website design. Martin accompanies the strip with short text pieces and photos explaining the real-life aspects of Antarctic life that inspire the strip. The box gives real-life weather updates for the Antarctic Peninsula. On July 3, 2006, to mark the strip's first anniversary, Martin relaunched the site with a new URL, design and title, Wally and Osborne, on the grounds that On the Rocks was too generic a phrase. The site's original design, including the original title logo, is still available on the site as an alternative theme. The original title temporarily continued to appear on the comic's syndicated appearances (see below) until 2008, when the comic on the website came to an end. Martin has released few details as of to why. On September 3, 2015, seven years after the last update, Martin announced via a new patreon page that he was returning to continue the series, with new installments every Monday.

Both countries pledged to resolve their problems by bilateral negotiations and to forgo armed conflict for a period of 10 years. The pact effectively normalised relations between Poland and Germany, which had been strained by border disputes arising from the territorial settlement in the Treaty of Versailles. Germany effectively recognised Poland's borders and moved to end an economically-damaging customs war between the two countries that had taken place over the previous decade.Anna M. Cienciala, \\"The Foreign Policy of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski and J√≥zef Beck, 1926-1939: Misconceptions and Interpretations,\\" The Polish Review (2011) 56#1 pp. 111‚Äì151 online Before 1933, Poland had worried that some sort of alliance would take place between Germany and the Soviet Union to the detriment of Poland. Therefore, Poland made a military alliance with France. Because the Nazis and the Communists were bitter enemies of each other, a hostile Soviet-German alliance after Hitler came to power in 1933 seemed very unlikely.Gerhard L. Weinberg, The Foreign Policy of Hitler‚Äôs Germany (1970) pp 57-74.  Motivations  One of the most noted of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's foreign policies was his rumoured proposal to France to declare war on Germany after Adolf Hitler had come to power, in January 1933. Some historians speculate that Pi≈Çsudski may have sounded out France on the possibility of joint military action against Germany, which had been openly rearming in violation of the Treaty of Versailles. France's refusal might have been one of the reasons that Poland signed the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact. However, the argument that the pact had been forced on Pi≈Çsudski by French refusal to wage a \\"preventive war\\" has been disputed by historians, who point out that there is no evidence in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal was ever advanced. They state that when in late October 1933, rumours of a Polish \\"preventive-war\\" proposal were reported in Paris, their source was the Polish embassy, which had informed French reporters that Poland had proposed a \\"preventive war\\" to France and Belgium, but Poland and Germany had already been secretly negotiating the pact. It has been argued that Pi≈Çsudski had the Polish embassy start rumors about a \\"preventive war\\" to pressure the Germans, who were demanding for Poland to abrogate its 1921 Franco-Polish alliance. The pact would specifically exclude that alliance. Dariusz Baliszewski, Ostatnia wojna marsza≈Çka, Tygodnik \\"Wprost\\", Nr 1148 (28 November 2004), Polish, retrieved on 24 March 2005 It has been said that Pi≈Çsudski's reason for seeking the Pact with Germany was his concern over France's Maginot Line. Until 1929, French plans had called for a French offensive into the North German Plain, in conjunction with offensives from Poland and Czechoslovakia. The construction of the Maginot Line, which began in 1929, indicated the French Army's preference for a strictly-defensive stance, which would leave its eastern allies on their own. (That is exactly what happened in 1939 during the Phoney War.) From Pi≈Çsudski's viewpoint, in the light of France's military plans, a non-aggression pact with Germany would be the best choice for Poland. Pi≈Çsudski used Hitler's rise to power and international isolation of Germany's new regime as an opportunity to reduce the risk that Poland would become the first victim of German aggression or of a great power especially the Four Power Pact. Germany's new rulers seemed to depart from the traditionally- Prussian orientation that was anti-Polish. Pi≈Çsudski regarded the new chancellor as less dangerous than his immediate predecessors, such as Gustav Stresemann, and since he saw the Soviet Union as the greater threat, he opposed French and Czechoslovak efforts to include the Soviet Union in a common front against Germany. The Poles insisted on stating that it did not nullify any previous international agreements, particularly the one with France. Nevertheless, by easing Poland's disputes with Germany bilaterally, the treaty weakened France's diplomatic position against Germany. To allay any fears of a war against the Soviet Union, on May 5, 1934, Poland renewed the Soviet‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact, which had been first signed on July 25, 1932. It was extended until December 31, 1945 despite Hitler‚Äôs repeated suggestion to form a German-Polish alliance against the Soviets. Poland was able to maintain friendly relations with Germany for the next five years but also with France and Britain. However, that may have also led to inattentiveness in foreign policy about the activities of the crumbling League of Nations and ignoring the collective security schemes that had been proposed by French and Czechoslovakia in the early 1930s. Aftermath Pi≈Çsudski distrusted German intentions on the whole but perceived Hitler's origins as an Austrian, rather than a Prussian, as a mitigating factor and stated that Hitler should stay in power as long as possible.A Low Dishonest Decade. Paul N. Hehn, 2005. The pact has been seen as an instance of political weakness brought on by Pi≈Çsudski's illness, and it was likened to the interwar lack of leadership that was displayed by Neville Chamberlain and Paul von Hindenburg.David Owen, \\"Diseased, demented, depressed: serious illness in Heads of State\\", QJM: An International Journal of Medicine 96 (2003), 325-336. German policy changed drastically in late 1938, after the annexation of Sudetenland sealed the fate of Czechoslovakia, and Poland became Hitler's next target. In October 1938, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop presented Poland with the proposition of renewing the pact in exchange for allowing the Free City of Danzig to be annexed by Germany and the construction of an extraterritorial motorway and railway through the Polish Corridor, with Germany accepting Poland's postwar borders. Since Poland refused, Hitler rescinded the pact unilaterally on April 28, 1939 during an address before the Reichstag while Germany renewed its territorial claims in Poland. After another few months of rising tension and the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, which contained a secret protocol by which Hitler and Stalin agreed to divide Poland between them, Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, which initiated World War II.

Early life Born on a farm near Lakin, Kansas, 40 miles from the Colorado line, he was raised on a farm near Hutchinson, Kansas, where his father, William R. Crow, and mother, Gertrude Phillips Crow, dealt in livestock and trotting horses. He began to study piano at age 6, improvising his own music when repetitious exercises bored him, and began vocal instruction at 13. Three years later, he toured the Midwest as tenor with a quartet called The Meistersingers. He began studying at the University of Kansas, but attended a revival meeting conducted by Jesse Kellems and was so deeply impressed that he accepted an offer from the evangelist to become his musical director. During a subsequent stop in Iola, Kansas, young Crow himself was ordained, despite his never having studied for the ministry.Fish, Emond S. and Manning, Edwin H. \\"The Story Man.\\" Saturday Evening Post, February 9, 1946 By 1921, the Reverend Francis Luther Crow was in the pulpit of the First Christian Church in Bakersfield, California. There, he organized a 30-voice children's choir, an 80-voice adult choir, and two church orchestras. Writing and delivering his weekly sermons proved more problematic, and the Boy Preacher, as he was known locally, resigned to devote his creative energies to the world of music. Returning to Kansas, he married vocalist/musician Zora Layman on May 8, 1920, and the young couple eventually worked their way to New York City. In 1926, he was seriously pursuing further vocal training when he was invited to join the DeReszke Singers, as tenor/accompanist. They declared his surname, Crow, to be un-musical, and so he dropped it and became Frank Luther from that day on. The quartet toured with humorist Will Rogers, with whom Frank spent considerable time while on the road.Scott, James W. From Pulpit to Tom Sawyer Music, The Kansas City Times, July 17, 1958 Luther joined a popular quartet, The Revelers, as tenor in 1927. They toured the British Isles, where Frank met the future Queen of the United Kingdom and did a set accompanied on the drums by the Prince of Wales. His career seemed to be at its zenith, but he contracted a severe cold on the way back to New York. A long-lasting sinus infection and infected throat robbed his ability to sing for nearly a year. His voice returned in a painfully slow manner. Country music hits In 1928, with his singing only gradually returning to top form, Frank met and became acquainted with fellow Kansan Carson Robison, who had teamed with tenor Vernon Dalhart to make many dozens of top-selling recordings of rural American favorites, shortly to be known in the trade as hillbilly music. Robison and Dalhart were severing their recording partnership, and it was suggested that Luther listen to some Dalhart records and seek to approximate his style. From 1928 to 1932, Frank Luther recorded country music with Carson Robison. Their recordings, made for several record companies and issued on a variety of labels, were extremely popular. \\"Barnacle Bill the Sailor,\\" \\"When Your Hair Has Turned to Silver,\\" \\"When It's Springtime in the Rockies,\\" \\"When the Bloom is On The Sage,\\" \\"Little Green Valley,\\" \\"Down on the Old Plantation,\\" \\"I'm Alone Because I Love You,\\" \\"The Utah Trail,\\" \\"Goin' Back to Texas,\\" \\"Left My Gal in the Mountains,\\" \\"In the Cumberland Mountains,\\" \\"An Old Man's Story, \\"Little Cabin in the Cascade Mountains,\\" and \\"The Birmingham Jail\\" sold a great many copies and influenced future generations of country singers. In his recordings for Victor Records, he also used the alias Bud Billings. The UK Zonophone label used these masters as well, with the Bud Billings name. When Robison formed his own cowboy singing group for a British tour in 1932, Frank Luther assembled a new trio with his wife, Zora Layman, and baritone Leonard Stokes. They recorded some sides for RCA Victor, but 75-cent country records were not selling very well in the Depression which was just getting underway. Art Satherley, legendary producer for the American Record Corporation, began to record the Luther Trio on 25-cent chain store discs. Coincidental with their first ARC releases came the group's debut on the NBC radio series, Hillbilly Heart-throbs in 1933. Created and written by folklorist/writer/performer Ethel Park Richardson, the network series dramatized old Appalachian ballads as well as newer country music narrative songs. Well-known radio actors played the dramatic roles, with the musical bridges between scenes furnished by the Frank Luther Trio. Richardson, whom Luther would refer to forty years later as a wonderful woman, introduced him to many mountain songs and influenced his repertoire. While on her show, Zora Layman became the first country female singer to have a major hit record with Bob Miller's \\"Seven Years With the Wrong Man.\\" Her debut performance caused the NBC switchboard to light up for two hours. Frank scored hits with \\"Rocking Alone in An Old Rocking Chair,\\" \\"When the White Azaleas Start Blooming,\\" \\"The Old Spinning Wheel,\\" \\"Home on the Range,\\" \\"New Twenty- One Years,\\" and \\"Seven Years With the Wrong Woman.\\" Encyclopedia of Country Music, Oxford Press, New York, 1998. In 1940, Luther sang on I'll Never Forget, a radio program on the Mutual Broadcasting System. Dance band vocalist While Frank Luther's role in the early development of country & western music is significant, he regularly performed many other types of music. From 1928 until the outbreak of World War II, he recorded hundreds of vocal choruses with popular dance bands of the day. The High Hatters, Victor Arden and Phil Ohman, Leo Reisman, Russell Wooding's Red Caps, Joe Venuti, and many other recording bands featured Frank's jazzy tenor vocals. He was also tenor with a number of pop trios and quartets, performing not only on records but on radio broadcasts‚Äîoften as many as five different programs per day. He also made a series of movie shorts in New York, several of which were released by Educational Pictures. In 1936, he starred in his only full-length Hollywood feature, a story about radio entertainers called High Hat. Children's records Frank Luther's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame represents what was to become his chief claim to fame. Early in his recording career, he made some 7\\" shellac records for children. Several sets were made for Victor in 1933. In 1934, however, Jack Kapp signed Frank to record for the new 35-cent blue label Decca company. He began by making a series of hillbilly records, but did two 78rpm albums of songs for children a few months later. \\"Mother Goose Songs\\" and \\"Nursery Rhymes,\\" the first two albums, featured Frank's tenor voice in brief interpretations of traditional children's tunes, tied together with gentle and pleasant narration. At one point in the Decca set, Luther introduced a lullaby by calmly saying, \\"Mother tucks you in, kisses you, and leaves you in the nice, friendly darkness. Mother's so wonderful, isn't she? Love her every day you live. She loves you so much.\\" Two pediatricians told Luther that they had used his record to calm small children who feared being in the dark. Child psychologists began to endorse the Luther recordings. The first two albums sold in enormous quantity, and were pressed numerous times.Fish, Edmond S. and Manning, Edwin H. The Story Man. Saturday Evening Post, February 9, 1946 Frank Luther's country music days came to a halt, and he did fewer dance band vocal choruses. He was now in demand as Decca's performer of children's songs and stories. Selling even better were his recordings of Winnie-the-Pooh Songs based on A.A. Milne's books for children78 RPM - Frank Luther ‚Äì Winnie The Pooh: The King's Breakfast (1933), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1Whs-T40Tk and Babar Songs and Stories based on Jean de Brunhoff's Babar the Elephant books.The Story of Babar, Parts 1 and 2, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV6cNlUYD_o&t;=1sBabar The King - Frank Luther - Marathon Gramophone - Rex 78 rpm - Elephants, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K66XD8tCs9o A Luther-composed \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" album, a true-to-the-original album of songs from Disney's \\"Snow White, \\"Tuneful Tales,\\" \\"Manners Can Be Fun,\\" \\"Raggedy Ann Songs,\\" and hundreds more established Frank Luther as the dean of children's recordings. Decca claimed, in 1946, that 85% of the records for young people sold in the English-speaking world were Luther's. Stephen Foster melodies While his recordings for children remained his chief claim to fame, Luther made a number of successful 78rpm album sets for Decca in the late 1930s and early 1940s. Focusing on Americana (he wrote a book, Americans and Their Songs, published in 1942), he made albums of Civil War songs from both the North and South, songs of early New York, songs of old California, Gay Nineties songs, Irish favorites, and rare Christmas carols. Many of these he and Zora Layman performed on their own radio series. Most widely acclaimed were two albums of compositions by Stephen Foster. Performed with a sensitivity and sentimentality stylistically consistent with the famous American composer's approach, Luther's renditions were active in the Decca catalogue for some fifteen years. His interpretations of such compositions as \\"Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway,\\" \\"The Hour For Thee and Me,\\" \\"Beautiful Dreamer,\\" \\"Sweetly She Sleeps, My Alice Fair,\\" \\"My Old Kentucky Home\\" and \\"Comrades, Fill No Glass For Me\\" were acclaimed by music critics of the day. After World War II In 1946, Luther - by now a Decca Records executive, in charge of children's, educational, and religious recordings - returned to the studios to re-record many of his pre-war albums for children and to make many others, including \\"The Birthday Party Record\\" released on Decca in the fall of 1950. He had taken college-level courses in child psychology and was now busy as an educational lecturer, also doing hundreds of personal appearances in schools each year. Recording prolifically, his tenor voice began to mellow. By the early 1950s, he was singing baritone. Some years earlier, Luther and Zora Layman had divorced. He remarried and had two children, a daughter and son, in the late 1940s. He continued to record regularly for Decca through 1954. While planning a record album based on Mark Twain's Tom Sawyer, Luther began writing songs based on the book and soon found that he had enough for a full-length play for adult audiences. The show he devised did not reach Broadway, but it was turned into a network television special on the U.S. Steel Hour in 1956. Decca released an original cast album that same year. The musical was subsequently performed around the country by little theatre groups and stock companies. Frank Luther continued to record, forming his own label and then working for a variety of educational record companies. He did a series for United Artists Records, some albums of songs adapted from the writings of various children's authors, and some narrations of children's books. These included Babar Songs and Stories, an LP of retellings of Jean de Brunhoff's Babar the Elephant series he recorded for Vocalion Records in the early 1960s. On this album he punctuated his narrations of The Story of Babar, The Travels of Babar, Babar the King, Babar and his Children, Zephir's Holiday and Babar and Father Christmas with snatches of song at various junctures in the stories. Luther also produced albums by others. His best-known work as a producer was the million-selling original cast album of the Off-Broadway musical, The Fantasticks. Luther's \\"Happy the Harmonica\\" was covered by media satirists Negativland on their album Free. Final years Luther's last two albums, made in stereo for Pickwick International, were nostalgic re-visits to two familiar themes, A Treasury of Mother Goose Songs and American Folk Songs. He did not retire, but continued to write scores and work on recording projects in the 1970s, one being a set of songs about protecting the environment. Frank Luther died in New York City in 1980, at age 80.

It features three segments, each based on unrelated short stories by Richard Matheson. The first follows a college professor who seeks excitement with her students; the second is about twin sisters who have a bizarre relationship; and the third focuses on a woman terrorized by a Zuni fetish doll in her apartment. Black stars in all three segments, and plays dual roles in the second. The film was first aired as an ABC Movie of the Week on March 4, 1975. Black initially turned down the project, but reconsidered when her then-husband, Robert Burton, was cast in the first segment \\"Julie\\". A television film sequel titled Trilogy of Terror II, written and also directed by Dan Curtis, was released in 1996. Plots =\\"Julie\\"= Chad (Robert Burton) is a college student with a crush on his English teacher, Julie Eldridge (Karen Black). During one class, Chad is distracted by Julie's thigh as she sits on her desk, and he daydreams about her. Chad reveals his fantasies to his friend Eddie (James Storm), but Eddie discourages him from becoming romantically involved with teachers. Later that evening, when Julie is undressing in her room, Chad watches her through a window. The next day, he asks Julie out on a date. She initially refuses, but later accepts the offer. During the date at a drive-in theater, Chad spikes Julie's drink, rendering her unconscious, and drives her to a motel. After checking them in as husband and wife, he photographs her in a variety of sexually provocative positions. He then pulls up to her house as she begins to regain consciousness, saying that she had fallen asleep during the movie. After developing the photographs in his darkroom, Chad shows the pictures to Julie. She is furious and threatens to call the police. Chad blackmails Julie into submitting to his romantic attentions. After several weeks of this, Julie announces, \\"The game is over.\\" She reveals that it was actually she who had manipulated Chad in an elaborate role play of her own design. \\"Did you really think that dull, little mind of yours could possibly have conceived any of the rather dramatic experiences we've shared? Why do you think you suddenly had the overwhelming desire to see what I looked like under 'all those clothes?' Don't feel bad ... I always get bored after a while.\\" Chad realizes that Julie has poisoned his drink, and then he collapses. Julie drags him into the darkroom where she sets fire to the offending photographs. Chad's death is later reported in local media as a house fire. Julie adds the newspaper story to a scrapbook of articles depicting students who met similar fates. There is a knock at the door, and another young handsome student (played in a bit role by Gregory Harrison) in need of a tutor enters. =\\"Millicent and Therese\\"= This tale of sibling rivalry focuses on sisters Millicent, a repressed, unattractive and prudish brunette; and Therese, a worldly, seductive, and free-spirited blonde. Both roles are played by Karen Black. Millicent has determined that Therese is evil, and plants a voodoo talisman to kill her. When Millicent's friend Dr. Ramsey enters the house, he finds Therese dead on her bedroom floor with the doll next to her and Millicent is nowhere to be found. Dr. Ramsey reveals, as the family doctor, that \\"Therese\\" and \\"Millicent\\" are the same person; Therese suffered from multiple personality disorder brought on by the fact that \\"Therese\\" slept with her father and subsequently killed her mother ‚Äî and \\"Millicent\\" was an alternative personality with a repressed sexuality to cope with the horror of her actions. The recent death of the father unhinged her further and the \\"murder\\" was actually a form of suicide. =\\"Amelia\\"= \\"Amelia\\" was filmed like a one- woman play, with Karen Black as the only actor. It was also the only film of the three whose script was written by the original author of the story, Richard Matheson. \\"Amelia\\" is based on his 1969 short story, \\"Prey\\". The other two are based on stories by Matheson as well, but their screenplays were written by someone else. Amelia lives alone in a high-rise apartment building. She returns home after a fateful shopping spree carrying a package containing a wooden fetish doll, crafted in the form of a misshapen aboriginal warrior equipped with pointy, sharp teeth and a spear. A scroll comes with the doll, claiming that the doll contains the actual spirit of a Zuni hunter named \\"He Who Kills\\", and that the gold chain adorning the doll keeps the spirit trapped within. As Amelia makes a call to her mother we learn that she suffers from her mother's overbearing behavior. Amelia struggles to justify her independence and cancels their plans for the evening by claiming she has a date. As Amelia leaves the room, we see that the Zuni fetish doll's golden chain has somehow fallen off. Later, Amelia is preparing dinner, using a carving knife. She enters the darkened living room, and realizes the doll is not on the coffee table. Amelia hears a noise in the kitchen and when she investigates, the knife is missing. Returning to the living room, she is suddenly attacked by the doll, which stabs at her ankles viciously. She attempts to flee, but the doll chases her around the apartment. In the bathroom, Amelia envelops the doll in a towel and attempts futilely to drown it in the bathtub. She later traps it in a suitcase, but the doll begins cutting a circular hole through the top of suitcase with the butcher knife. After several more vicious attacks, Amelia manages to hurl the doll into the oven where it catches fire. She holds the oven door while she listens to the doll howling and screaming as it burns and, while black smoke billows out, she waits until the screaming eventually stops. Opening the oven to ensure that the doll is \\"dead\\", she is struck by some force that pushes her backward and from which she emits a blood-curdling scream. At some point after that, the audience sees Amelia (from behind) place another call to her mother. In a calm, controlled voice, she apologizes for her behavior during the previous call, and invites her mother to come for dinner. She then rips the bolt from her front door and crouches down low in an animalistic manner, carrying a large carving knife. She is now seen frontally, stabbing at the floor with the weapon, grinning ferally and revealing the horrific teeth of the Zuni fetish doll whose spirit now inhabits her body.

The segments \\"Julie\\" and \\"Millicent and Therese\\" were adapted by William F. Nolan, while Matheson adapted \\"Amelia\\" into a teleplay himself. On January 4, 1975, it was reported that Karen Black had signed on to appear in the film, portraying the three central characters. =Filming= Filming for Trilogy of Terror took place on location in Hollywood, Los Angeles in the winter of 1974‚Äì1975. Release Trilogy of Terror first aired on ABC in the 8:30 p.m. time slot on March 4, 1975. =Critical response= The Boston Globe praised Karen Black's \\"tour-de- force performance\\" in the film upon its original airing. Black felt the film led to genre typecasting, forcing her to accept many roles in B-grade horror films following the film's release. She stated, \\"I think this little movie took my life and put it on a path that it didn't even belong in.\\" On the internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 90% based on , with a weighted average rating of 8.1/10. Jeremiah Kipp from Slant Magazine awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, praising the film's direction, script, and Black's performance. On Black's performance, Kipp wrote, \\"Black plays the female protagonist in each story, and she‚Äôs the kind of extreme actress who not only acts with her eyes and face, but with her neck, her fingertips, her elbows, wrists, and torso. Gusto is not the word.\\" Writing for AXS, Octavio Ramos deemed \\"Julie\\" a \\"lackluster story,\\" but added: \\"Let‚Äôs face it, there‚Äôs only one real reason to watch Trilogy of Terror: The third segment of this made-for-television anthology, which features the famous Zuni fetish doll that comes to life and torments Karen Black. This segment alone makes Trilogy of Terror a must-own product for even the most casual horror fan.\\" Felix Vasquez from Cinema Crazed.com felt that the first two segments were \\"forgettable\\", and stated that only the last segment was \\"truly entertaining and creepy\\". Concluding his review, Vasquez wrote, \\"Trilogy of Terror was an all around disappointing film with a steady focus on psychological torment and less on actual terror or scares. I wish I could join along with the crowd and praise this film, but I would have had to be entertained to do so.\\" TV Guide offered the film similar criticism, awarding it 2/4 stars. The reviewer criticized the first two segments as being \\"utterly wash out\\" in terms of suspense, dialogue, and storytelling. However, the reviewer commended the final segment as being \\" a simple, engrossing and claustrophobic set-piece of fear\\". Meagan Navarro from Bloody Disgusting included Trilogy of Terror in her list of \\"10 Scariest Made For TV Horror Movies\\", praising the final segment as 'keeping the film forever at the forefront of made-for-television movie memory'. =Home media= The film was released on VHS by Anchor Bay Entertainment on July 11, 2000. Anchor Bay later released the film on DVD on August 25, 1999. The film was released on DVD Special Edition by MPI Home Video August 29, 2006. The film was released on Blu-ray and on DVD by Kino Lorber Studio Classics on October 16, 2018. Both Blu-ray and DVD are remastered in 4K. Legacy Trilogy of Terror has developed a cult following over the years and earned a reputation as a cult classic.\\"Dark Sky Rising ‚Äì The New York Sun\\".\\"Playing on our fears: ‚ÄòThe Boy‚Äô resurrects homicidal-doll theme\\". It also helped establish Karen Black a devoted cult following as a performer in horror films. The Zuni Doll from the segment Amelia has been called by some as being \\"one of the scariest dolls in movie history\\". In 2011, Complex magazine named Trilogy of Terror the fourth- greatest television film of all time, while MeTV deemed it the scariest television film of all time in 2016. Sequel A sequel titled Trilogy of Terror II was aired on October 30, 1996. The sequel was again directed by Dan Curtis, who also co-wrote the film, and starred Lysette Anthony.

Between 1991 and 1995, the group recorded three albums and several singles for the independent labels Cargo, Jade Tree, Matador Records and Simple Machines. Style Although based in Washington, Pitchblende's dense, angular sound was commonly thought to be closer in style to the contemporary music scenes in New York City and Chicago than what was heard on the DC-based post-punk labels at the time. Central to Pitchblende's approach was an emphasis on experimentation and dynamics; the band's songs often used complex structures, unusual arrangements, alternative tunings and jarring time changes. Pitchblende's recordings and loud, energetic live shows earned them critical accolades and comparisons with influential bands such as Mission of Burma and Sonic Youth. The group melded together the chaotic spirit of punk with an absurdist, dada aesthetic; somewhat pop sensibilities; and a musical proficiency informed by prog-rock bands. In spite of occasional references to being inspired by jazz, very little of Pitchblende's music was improvisational. This misconception prompted the band to cheekily rename itself The Pitchblende Quartet for its final 1995 album, Gygax!. Break up Despite extensive touring and a prolific recorded output, Pitchblende remained largely a favorite of critics and college radio. After a disastrous final US tour in 1994 when the band's gear was stolen in San Francisco and DeSimon was attacked and beaten up in New Mexico, Chearno and DeSimon moved to Brooklyn where they formed the three piece instrumental band Turing Machine. Chearno went on to form the bands Doldrums and Panthers. Today, Chearno works in the wine industry in New York between recording and touring. DeSimon is a magazine editor. Gough is an urban planner in Toronto who played in the D.C.-based trio Imperial China from 2007 to 2013, and Treyfid is a Los Angeles-based fine artist, solo musician and graphic designer.

He currently works as an assistant coach under Mal Meninga for the Australian rugby league team. A Queensland State of Origin representative half, he played his club football in Australia with Canterbury-Bankstown (with whom he won the 1988 and 1985 premierships) and Newcastle (whom he captained), as well as in England with Halifax. He went on to have a successful coaching career with Newcastle (winning the premiership with them in 2001) and Parramatta, and was also selected to coach the Queensland Maroons for two State of Origin series before becoming Meninga's assistant coach. Hagan was inducted into the Newcastle Knights Hall of Fame in April, 2012. Playing career The younger brother of former Test Bob Hagan, Hagan was graded with Canterbury in 1983. Although best suited to play at or , the presence of Terry Lamb and Steve Mortimer forced Hagan to play much of his career with Canterbury as a \\"fill in\\" at or lock forward. Hagan played a role filling in for Lamb in Canterbury's upset win in the 1985 grand final. In 1988 Hagan was injured in a car crash but recovered to play in Canterbury's three finals, scoring a try in the grand final. With Mortimer retiring, Hagan might have had a chance for a permanent position in the halves, but by this time he had already decided to move to Newcastle where he signed with the Knights. Hagan's craft and guile at five-eighth led to a rapid rise in the Knights' fortunes: they advanced from fourteenth to sixth (losing a play-off for fifth) in two seasons between 1988 and 1990. He took over Newcastle's captaincy in early 1990 and, despite fluctuating team fortunes and being moved to the less suitable centre position to accommodate the emerging Matthew Johns in his last season, finished his career with the record of having not missed a match in five season with the Knights. Hagan also played 92 games for Halifax in 1984-1985 and 1993-1995. During his career with Newcastle, Hagan played five State of Origin games for Queensland, deputising for Allan Langer in 1989. Coaching career Hagan was the media manager for the Hunter Mariners during the Super League war in Australia, and subsequently joined the coaching staff with Mal Meninga at the Canberra Raiders, coaching the President's Cup team in 1998 and First Division in 1999. In 2000 Hagan became the first division coach at the Newcastle Knights, and succeeded Warren Ryan as coach in 2001. He became the first former Knights player to coach the club, and later that season led them to victory in the 2001 NRL grand final, becoming the first coach since Phil Gould to win the premiership in his first season. Hagan coached the Queensland State of Origin team in 2004 and 2005. Although he was unable to win a series, in both years the series went to a deciding game, only for the Maroons to lose. During both years, Hagan coached the likes of Slater, Lockyer, Thurston, Thaiday, Smith and Bowen (whilst having to coach against Buderus, Simpson and Johns at the same time), most of whom went on to play for Australia, and most of whom featured prominently in Queensland's eight-year Origin reign between 2006 and 2013. Hagan resigned as Queensland coach in 2005 to concentrate on coaching the Knights given their poor season in which they finished at the foot of the ladder for the first time in the club's history. His successor, Mal Meninga, went on to win nine out of the following ten State of Origin series for Queensland. In 2010 Hagan returned to the Queensland side as an assistant coach. In 2005, after losing their first thirteen games of the season, the Knights finished with the wooden spoon. In early 2006, Hagan signed a contract to coach the Parramatta Eels from 2007 to 2009, finishing his tenure at Newcastle at the end of the 2006 season. He left the Knights as the longest serving coach in club history, and guided them to finals appearances in four of his six seasons, more than any other coach in the team's history. In 2007 the Eels showed much improvement under Hagan, spending much of the season at 3rd position on the ladder (only behind the Melbourne Storm and bitter rivals the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles) before a surprise defeat against his old club the Newcastle Knights (who were at the time coached by Brian Smith) triggered a late-season form slump. The Eels toned up for the finals by handing what was to be the Brisbane Broncos' worst-ever defeat at the time with a 68-22 mauling (this despite the Eels trailing 22-6 at one stage) in the final round at Parramatta Stadium. The Eels advanced to the finals finishing in 5th position which meant a tough away trip in the first round to face the 4th-placed New Zealand Warriors in New Zealand. The Eels managed to upset the Warriors 12-10 despite a late charge from the hosts. This earnt the Eels a home semi final match against long-time rivals the Bulldogs. The Eels also won this match comfortably, earning them a preliminary final showdown with the Melbourne Storm at Melbourne's Telstra Dome. The Eels were gallant in defeat, losing 24-10, whilst Melbourne ultimately went on to win the Grand Final. Following a relatively disappointing 2008 season, Michael Hagan ended his head coaching role at the Parramatta Eels citing family reasons and health. In 2010 he returned to coaching, being appointed the Maroons assistant coach. The Daily Telegraph Hagan has made journalistic contributions to 'League Central' section of The Daily Telegraph. He provides his opinions on current League issues as well as evaluating team form and performances.

He was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in Marshalltown, Iowa and Seattle, Washington. He graduated valedictorian of his high school class in Seattle at the age of 16, and attended the University of Washington, where he received both a B.S. and M.S. degree in Geology and Mining (1931 and 1932). He continued graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, receiving his doctorate in 1938, with a thesis on the ore bodies of the Virginia City mining district in Nevada. He was known as an eccentric and brilliant student. In 1937, Coats took a teaching job at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. He left that job for a post with the U.S. Geological Survey in 1939, in Washington, D.C.. As part of the Alaska Branch of the USGS, he continued working in Alaska, mapping in the Chichagof, Anikovik, Nome, Solomon, Kigluaik and Kobuk River areas, among others. During World War II, he spent time in the Aleutian Islands, returning in 1946 as part of the Survey‚Äôs Volcano Project. His field work in the Aleutians led to his 1962 paper (see references) on the origin of the Aleutian island arc. That prescient synthesis of tectonics and magmatism of the Aleutian arc contained several of the essential ideas of the subsequent paradigm of plate tectonics. He correctly interpreted: # that the origin of the dipping zone of seismicity beneath the Aleutian arc occurs along a megathrust above underthrusting oceanic crust and its sedimentary cover; # the relation between the position of the active volcanoes and depth to the underthrust oceanic crust; # the role of fluids derived from the down-going slab and magmatic differentiation in determining compositions of erupted volcanic rocks (See Figure 1). Coats‚Äôs colleagues from the Alaska Branch of the USGS have commented on his extraordinary ability to comprehend the detailed geologic history of an area with only the most cursory examination. Visiting the Aleutian islands of Buldir, Adak, Kanaga, Semisophochnoi, Gareloi, Kiska and Amchitka (among others), typically for 1‚Äì2 days in notoriously bad weather, he produced geologic reports of such detail, insight and quality that they remain today, even in the face of much additional work, the prime source for understanding Aleutian geology. From 1951 to 1954, Coats was engaged in the search for radioactive granitic rocks, and in field studies of rhyolitic extrusive rocks. His field work took him to New England, and to all of the western states. In 1954, he began a long and productive period of work in Elko County, Nevada, where he studied rhyolites, stratigraphy and structure, and mapped the geology of the Jarbidge, Owyhee, Mountain City and Tuscarora 15‚Äô quadrangles. He relocated to Menlo Park, California in 1956, but spent most summers with his family in a field camp in Nevada. Many of his 70 publications were based on his work in this period, which culminated in his 1987 synthesis report on the Geology of Elko County, a complex area the size of Connecticut and Massachusetts together. The 1:250,000 scale map for the report has a total of 109 mapping units, with areas mapped as small as 10 ha. Although most of his professional career was spent outside of academia, Coats enjoyed mentoring and teaching one-on-one. Many of his former field assistants and prot√©g√©s have gone on to illustrious careers in universities and government service. Coats was married for 58 years to Elizabeth Robinson Coats. He died peacefully at his home in Aptos, California, on January 12, 1995. He was survived by two sons (David of Minneapolis and Robert of Berkeley) and a daughter (Katherine Mrache, of Aptos), and seven grandchildren.

It forms through liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), leading to a dense phase in thermodynamic equilibrium with a dilute phase. The dispersed droplets of dense phase are also called coacervates, micro-coacervates or coacervate droplets.These structures draw a lot of interest because they form spontaneously from aqueous mixtures and provide stable compartmentalization without the need of a membrane. The term coacervate was coined in 1929 by Dutch chemist Hendrik G. Bungenberg de Jong and Hugo R. Kruyt while studying lyophilic colloidal dispersions. The name is a reference to the clustering of colloidal particles, like bees in a swarm. The concept was later borrowed by Russian biologist Alexander I. Oparin to describe the proteinoid microspheres proposed to be primitive cells (protocells) on early Earth (garbage bags). Coacervate-like protocells are at the core of the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis. A reawakening of coacervate research was seen in the 2000's, starting with the recognition in 2004 by Scientists at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) that some marine invertebrates (such as the sandcastle worm) exploit complex coacervation to produce water-resistant biological adhesives. A few years later in 2009 the role of liquid-liquid phase separation was further recognized to be involved in the formation of certain membraneless organelles by American biophysicist Clifford Brangwynne and Tony Hyman. Liquid organelles share features with coacervate droplets and fueled the study of coacervates for biomimicry.  Thermodynamics  Coacervates are a type of lyophilic colloid; that is, the dense phase retains some of the original solvent ‚Äì generally water ‚Äì and does not collapse into solid aggregates, rather keeping a liquid property. Coacervates can be characterized as complex or simple based on the driving force for the LLPS: associative or segregative. Associative LLPS is dominated by attractive interactions between macromolecules (such as electrostatic force between oppositely charged polymers), and segregative LLPS is driven by the minimization of repulsive interactions (such as hydrophobic effect on proteins containing a disordered region). The thermodynamics of segregative LLPS can be described by a Flory- Huggins polymer mixing model (see equation). In ideal polymer solutions, the free-energy of mixing (ŒîmixG) is negative because the mixing entropy (ŒîmixS, combinatorial in the Flory-Huggins approach) is negative and the interaction enthalpies are all taken as equivalent (ŒîmixH or œá = 0). In non-ideal solutions, ŒîmixH can be different than zero, and the process endothermic enough to overcome the entropic term and favor the de-mixed state (the blue curve shifts up). Low molecular-weight solutes will hardly reach such non- ideality, whereas for polymeric solutes, with increasing interactions sites N and therefore decreasing entropic contribution, simple coacervation is much more likely. \\\\Delta_{m i x} G=\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{N} \\\\ln \\\\phi+(1-\\\\phi) \\\\ln (1-\\\\phi)+\\\\Delta_{\\\\operatorname{mix}} H \\\\Delta_{m i x} G=k_{B} T\\\\left[\\\\frac{\\\\phi}{N} \\\\ln \\\\phi+(1-\\\\phi) \\\\ln (1-\\\\phi)\\\\right]+\\\\Delta_{\\\\operatorname{mix}} H \\\\Delta_{\\\\operatorname{mix}} H =\\\\chi \\\\phi(1-\\\\phi) The phase diagram of the mixture can be predicted by experimentally determining the two-phase boundary, or binodal curve. In a simplistic theoretical approach, the binodes are the compositions at which the free energy of de-mixing is minimal (\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Delta_{\\\\operatorname{mix}} G}{\\\\partial x}=0 Free energy of de-mixing according to Flory-Huggins approach. By determining the free-energy curve for different temperatures and taking the critical points, the phase diagram on the right can be constructed. ), across different temperatures (or other interaction parameter). Alternatively, by minimizing the change in free energy of de-mixing in regards to composition (\\\\frac{\\\\partial^{2} \\\\Delta_{\\\\operatorname{mix}} G}{\\\\partial x^{2}}=0), the spinodal curve is defined. The conditions of the mixture in comparison to the two curves defines the phase separation mechanism: nucleation-growth of coacervate droplets (when the binodal region is crossed slowly) and spinodal decomposition. Associative LLPS is more complex to describe, as both solute polymers are present in the dilute and dense phase. Electrostatic-based complex coacervates are the most common, and in that case the solutes are two polyelectrolytes of opposite charge. The Voorn-Overbeek approach applies the Debye-H√ºckel approximation to the enthalpic term in the Flory-Huggins model, and considers two polyelectrolytes of the same length and at the same concentration. Complex coacervates are a subset of aqeous two-phase systems (ATPS), which also include segregatively separated systems in which both phases are enriched in one type of polymer. Phase diagrams for coacervation  Coacervates in biology  Membraneless organelles (MLOs), also known as biomolecular condensates, are a form of cell compartmentalization. Unlike classic membrane-bound organelles (e.g. mitochondrion, nucleus or lysosome), MLOs are not separated from their surroundings by a lipid bilayer. MLOs are mostly composed of proteins and nucleic acids, held together by weak intermolecular forces. MLOs are present in the cytoplasm (e.g. stress granules, processing bodies) and in the nucleus (e.g. nucleolus, nuclear speckles). They have been shown to serve various functions: they can store and protect cellular material during stress conditions, they participate in gene expression and they are involved in the control of signal transduction. It is now widely believed that MLOs form through LLPS. This was first proposed after observing that Cajal bodies and P granules show liquid-like properties, and was later confirmed by showing that liquid condensates can be reconstituted from purified protein and RNA in vitro. However, whether MLOs should be referred to as liquids, remains disputable. Even if initially they are liquid-like, over time some of them maturate into solids (gel-like or even crystalline, depending on the extent of spatial ordering within the condensate). Many proteins participating in the formation of MLO contain so-called intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), parts of the polypeptide chain that can adopt multiple secondary structures and form random coils in solution. IDRs can provide interactions responsible for LLPS, but over time conformational changes (sometimes promoted by mutations or post-translational modifications) may lead to the formation of higher ordered structures and solidification of MLOs. Some MLOs serve their biological role as solid particles (e.g. Balbiani body stabilised by Œ≤-sheet structure), but in many cases transformation from liquid to solid results in the formation of pathological aggregates. Examples of both liquid-liquid phase separating and aggregation-prone proteins include FUS, TDP-43 and hnRNPA1. Aggregates of these proteins are associated with neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or frontotemporal dementia). History  At the start of the 20th century, scientists had become interested in the stability of colloids, both the dispersions of solid particles and the solutions of polymeric molecules. It was known that salts and temperature could often be used to cause flocculation of a colloid. The German chemist F.W. Tiebackx reported in 1911 that flocculation could also be induced in certain polymer solutions by mixing them together. In particular, he reported the observation of opalescence (a turbid mixture) when equal volumes of acidified 0.5% ‚Äúwashed‚Äù gelatine solution, and 2% gum arabic solution were mixed. Tiebackx did not further analyse the nature of the flocs, but it is likely that this was an example of complex coacervation. Dutch chemist H. G. Bungenberg-de Jong reported in his PhD thesis (Utrecht, 1921) two types of flocculation in agar solutions: one that leads to a suspensoid state, and one that leads to an emulsoid state. He observed the emulsoid state under the microscope and described small particles that merged into larger particles (Thesis, p. 82), most likely a description of coalescing coacervate droplets. Several years later, in 1929, Bungenberg-de Jong published a seminal paper with his PhD advisor, H. R. Kruyt, entitled ‚ÄúCoacervation. Partial miscibility in colloid systems‚Äù. In their paper, they give many more examples of colloid systems that flocculate into an emulsoid state, either by varying the temperature, by adding salts, co-solvents or by mixing together two oppositely charged polymer colloids, and illustrate their observations with the first microscope pictures of coacervate droplets. They term this phenomenon coacervation, derived from the prefix co and the Latin word acervus (heap), which relates to the dense liquid droplets. Coacervation is thus loosely translated as ‚Äòto come together in a heap‚Äô. Since then, Bungenberg-de Jong and his research group in Leiden published a range of papers on coacervates, including results on self-coacervation, salt effects, interfacial tension, multiphase coacervates and surfactant-based coacervates. In the meantime, Russian chemist Alexander Oparin, published a pioneering work in which he laid out his protocell theory on the origin of life. In his initial protocell model, Oparin took inspiration from Graham‚Äôs description of colloids from 1861 as substances that usually give cloudy solutions and cannot pass through membranes. Oparin linked these properties to the protoplasm, and reasoned that precipitates of colloids form as clots or lumps of mucus or jelly, some of which have structural features that resemble the protoplasm. According to Oparin, protocells could therefore have formed by precipitation of colloids. In his later work, Oparin became more specific about his protocell model. He described the work of Bungenberg-de Jong on coacervates in his book from 1938, and postulated that the first protocells were coacervates. Other researchers followed, and in the 1930s and 1940s various examples of coacervation were reported, by Bungenberg-de Jong, Oparin, Koets, Bank, Langmuir and others. In the 1950s and 1960s, focus shifted to a theoretical description of the phenomenon of (complex) coacervation. Voorn and Overbeek developed the first mean-field theory to describe coacervation. They estimated the total free energy of mixing as a sum of mixing entropy terms and mean-field electrostatic interactions in a Debye-H√ºckel approximation. Veis and Aranyi suggested to extend this model with an electrostatic aggregation step in which charge- paired symmetrical soluble aggregates are formed, followed by phase separation into liquid droplets. In the decades after that, until about 2000, the scientific interest in coacervates had faded. Oparin‚Äôs theory on the role of coacervates in the origin of life had been replaced by interest in the RNA world hypothesis. Renewed interest in coacervates originated as scientists recognized the relevance and versatility of the interactions that underlie complex coacervation in the natural fabrication of biological materials and in their self-assembly. Since 2009, coacervates have become linked to membraneless organelles and there has been a renewed interest in coacervates as protocells.  Coacervates hypothesis for the origin of life  Russian biochemist Aleksander Oparin and British biologist J.B.S. Haldane independently hypothesized in the 1920s that the first cells in early Earth‚Äôs oceans could be, in essence, coacervate droplets. Haldane used the term primordial soup to refer to the dilute mixture of organic molecules that could have built up as a result of reactions between inorganic building blocks such as ammonia, carbon dioxide and water, in presence of UV light as an energy source. Oparin proposed that simple building blocks with increasing complexity could organize locally, or self-assemble, to form protocells with living properties. He performed experiments based on Bungenberg de Jong‚Äôs colloidal aggregates (coacervates) to encapsulate proteinoids and enzymes within protocells. Further work by chemists Sidney Fox, Kaoru Harada, Stanley Miller and Harold Urey further strengthened the theory that inorganic building blocks could increase in complexity and give rise to cell-like structures. The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis established the foundations of research on the chemistry of abiogenesis, but the lipid-world and RNA-world scenarios have gained more attention since the 1980s with the work of Morowitz, Luisi and Szostak. However, recently, there has been a rising interest in coacervates as protocells, resonating with current findings that reactions too slow or unlikely in aqueous solutions can be significantly favored in such membraneless compartments.

Etymologically, the word comes from Rabelais' Third Book of Pantagruel (Tiers livre, 1546), in which it is written as \\"salmigondin\\". It seems to appear in English for the first time in the 17th century as a dish of cooked meats, seafood, vegetables, fruit, leaves, nuts and flowers and dressed with oil, vinegar and spices. There is some debate over sense and origin of the word.CRAIG CLAIBORNE The 'Salmagundi' Debate Continues; A Cold Salad Another Source January 16, 1978 New York Times The French word \\"salmigondis\\" has come to mean a hodgepodge or mix of widely disparate things. In English culture the term does not refer to a single recipe, but describes the grand presentation of a large plated salad comprising many disparate ingredients. These can be arranged in layers or geometrical designs on a plate or mixed. The ingredients are then drizzled with a dressing. The dish aims to produce wide range of flavours and colours and textures on a single plate. Often recipes allow the cook to add various ingredients which may be available at hand, producing many variations of the dish. Flowers from broom and sweet violet were often used. In Jamaica, Solomon Gundy refers more specifically to a dish made of salt herring and spices.The food of Jamaica: authentic recipes from the jewel of the Caribbean. John DeMers, Eduardo Fuss.

Etymology The word salmagundi is derived from the French word salmigondis which means disparate assembly of things, ideas or people, forming an incoherent whole. Salmagundi is used figuratively in modern English to mean a mixture or assortment of things. The name later evolved to Solomon Gundy in the eighteenth century. It seems likely that the name is connected with the children‚Äôs rhyme, Solomon Grundy. Solomon Gundy retains its food connotation today as the name given to a spicy Caribbean paste made of mashed, pickled herrings, peppers and onions.

They are also known as blocking highs or blocking anticyclones.Glossary of Meteorology, Second Edition; American Meteorological Society, 2000; . These blocks can remain in place for several days or even weeks, causing the areas affected by them to have the same kind of weather for an extended period of time (e.g. precipitation for some areas, clear skies for others). In the Northern Hemisphere, extended blocking occurs most frequently in the spring over the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Impact of the polar vortex Polar vortex and weather impacts due to stratospheric warming Polar cyclones are climatological features which hover near the poles year- round. They are weaker during summer and strongest during winter. When the polar vortex is strong, the Westerlies increase in strength. When the polar cyclone is weak, the general flow pattern across mid-latitudes buckles and significant cold outbreaks occur. Extratropical cyclones which occlude and migrate into higher latitudes create cold-core lows within the polar vortex. Volcanic eruptions in the tropics lead to a stronger polar vortex during the winter for as long as two years afterwards. The strength and position of the cyclone shapes the flow pattern across the hemisphere of its influence. An index which is used in the northern hemisphere to gauge its magnitude is the Arctic oscillation.Todd Mitchell (2004). Arctic Oscillation (AO) time series, 1899 ‚Äì June 2002. University of Washington. Retrieved on 2009-03-02. Omega blocks Omega blocks are so-named because the height fields with which they are associated in the Northern Hemisphere resemble an Œ©, the uppercase Greek letter omega. They typically have a low-high-low pattern, arranged in the west‚Äìeast direction. Rex blocks An example of a rex block off the West coast of North America in January 2007 Rex blocks (or dipole blocks) consist of a high situated poleward (north in the Northern Hemisphere; south in the Southern Hemisphere) of a low. Very often both the high and the low are closed, meaning that the isobars (or constant geopotential height lines) defining the high‚Äìlow close to form a circle.Brief page about Rex blocks Rex blocks are named after the meteorologist who first identified them. Cut-off highs and lows When an upper-level high- or low-pressure system becomes stuck in place due to a lack of steering currents, it is known as being \\"cut off\\". The usual pattern which leads to this is the jet stream retreating poleward, leaving the then cut-off system behind.Atmospheric Blocking Whether or not the system is of high- or low-pressure variety dictates the weather that the block causes. Precisely this situation occurred over the southern United States during late spring and early summer of 2007, when a cut-off-low system hovering over the region brought unusually cool temperatures and an extraordinary amount of rain to Texas and Oklahoma (see June 2007 Texas flooding), and a cut-off-high near the coast of Georgia that caused a drought in the Southeast that same year. If the block is a high, it will usually lead to dry, warm weather as the air beneath it is compressed and warmed, as happened in southeastern Australia in 2006 see p. 116 and 1967Victoria. Department of Crown Lands and Survey (Victoria, Australia); The Victorian Drought, 1967/68; published 1968 with resultant extreme droughts. Rainy, cooler weather results if the block is a low. Cold air damming When warm air ahead of an oncoming storm system overrides cool air trapped east of a mountain range, cloudiness and precipitation can occur for prolonged periods of time Blocking of atmospheric systems near the surface of the Earth occurs when a well-established poleward high pressure system lies near or within the path of the advancing storm system. The thicker the cold air mass is, the more effectively it can block an invading milder air mass. The depth of the cold air mass is normally shallower than the mountain barrier which created the cold air damming, or CAD. Some events across the Intermountain West can last for ten days. Pollutants and smoke can remain suspended within the stable air mass of a cold air dam. Midlatitude cold waves In the middle latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, areas on the eastern side of blocking anticyclones or under the influence of anomalous flows from colder continental interiors related to blocks experience severe winters, a phenomenon which has been known since the discovery of the North Atlantic Oscillation in the 1840s.van Loon, Harry and Rogers, Jeffrey C.; ‚ÄòThe Seesaw in Winter Temperatures Between Greenland and Northern Europe: Part I: General Description‚Äô; Monthly Weather Review, 106 (1978), pp. 296‚Äì310 These blocking patterns also have a tendency to produce anomalously mild conditions at very high latitudes, at least in those regions exposed to anomalous flow from the ocean as in Greenland and Beringia, or from chinook winds as in Interior Alaska. Such cold winters over the contiguous United States and southern Canada as 1911/12, 1935/36, 1977/78 and 1978/79 resulted from blocks in the Gulf of Alaska or to the east of the Mackenzie Mountains directing very cold Arctic air with a long trajectory as far as the American South,Carrera, M.L.; Higgins, R.W. and Kousky, V.E.; ‚ÄòDownstream Weather Impacts Associated with Atmospheric Blocking over the Northeast Pacific‚Äô; Journal of Climate, 17 (2004), pp. 4823‚Äì4839 as did the Western cold waves of 1889/90 and January 1950. In Northern and Western Europe, cold winters such as 1683/84, 1739/40, 1794/95, 1829/30, 1894/95, 1916/17, 1941/42, February 1947 and 1962/63 are almost always associated with high-latitude Atlantic blocking and an equatorward shift of the polar jet stream to Portugal and even Morocco. Over Central Asia, unusually cold winters like 1899/1900, 1929/30 and 1930/31, 1944/45, 1954/55 and 1968/69Hirschi, Jo√´l J.-M. and Sinha, Bablu; ‚ÄòNegative NAO and cold Eurasian winters: how exceptional was the winter of 1962/1963?‚Äô; Weather 62 (2007); pp. 43‚Äì48 are associated with blocking near the Ural Mountains extending the Siberian High westwards to push the very cold air from the Siberian ‚Äúcold pole‚Äù outward towards the Aral and Caspian Seas. Unlike other midlatitude regions of the Northern Hemisphere, however, cold winters in Europe (e.g. 1916/17, 1962/63) are often very mild over Central Asia, which can gain warm air advection from subtropical cyclones pushed to the south under negative NAO conditions.

They played in the top league in England until the 1957‚Äì58, season when they were relegated into the Second Division. Sunderland are England's sixth most successful club of all time, having won the English League championship six times: in 1892, 1893, 1895, 1902, 1913 and, most recently, in 1936.

As their popularity grew, they applied for admission into the Football League. At the League's annual meeting that considered this application, Sunderland offered to pay towards other clubs' travelling costs, to compensate for the extra distance these club would need to travel. This offer secured their place in the Football League. They replaced Stoke, one of the original League founding members, who failed to be re-elected.Days, pp. 27‚Äì28.

Campbell did not achieve the same playing success as former manager Watson, as Sunderland failed to win any titles in his three seasons at the club, which he left in the 1898‚Äì99 season to join Bristol City.Days, p. 45. Scotsman Alex Mackie replaced Campbell as manager, and gained success in the 1901‚Äì02 season when Sunderland won their fourth League title.Days, pp. 55‚Äì56. He followed this up with victory in the Sheriff of London Charity Shield, a competition featuring the best amateur and professional sides in England. Sunderland beat leading amateurs Corinthians 3‚Äì0.Days, pp. 59‚Äì60. In December 1902, Sunderland joined Arthur Bridgett. He went on to captain the \\"Black Cats\\" for ten years and gain his eleven England caps, making him Sunderland's second most-capped England International behind Dave Watson. In 1904 Sunderland were involved in a financial irregularity, when the club's board of directors gave their right back Andy McCombie ¬£100 (¬£ today) to start a business, with the view that his benefit game would enable him repay the money.Days, pp. 63‚Äì64. McCombie however, saw the money as a gift and refused to pay back the club. The Football Association launched an inquiry and agreed with McCombie, stating that it was a \\"resigning/win/draw bonus\\". The club's records showed further breaches of the League's financial rules. As a result, Sunderland were fined ¬£250 (¬£ today)and six directors were suspended for two and a half years. McCombie later signed for Newcastle United, and helped towards their spell of League success. After 214 matches in charge of Sunderland, Mackie left the club as a result of the \\"McCombie affair\\".Days, p. 65. He was replaced by Irishman Bob Kyle; another 70 candidates had also applied for the managerial.Days, p. 68. In 1905 Sunderland were involved in the first ¬£1,000 (¬£ today) transfer fee for a player, when Alf Common signed for Middlesbrough. The 1907‚Äì08 season included Sunderland's record League win, a 9‚Äì1 victory against Newcastle United at St James' Park.Days, pp. 73‚Äì74. Billy Hogg and George Holley each scored hat-tricks, while Arthur Bridgett scored two.Days, pp 73‚Äì76. Kyle achieved his only League championship in charge of Sunderland in the 1912‚Äì13 season, when they won the League with 54 points.Days, pp. 85‚Äì86. On 19 April 1913 Sunderland narrowly missed out on becoming one of the few clubs to win the League and cup double, when they were beaten 1‚Äì0 by Aston Villa in the FA Cup Final at Crystal Palace.Days, pp. 87‚Äì90. This period in their history also saw the goalscoring of Charlie Buchan, who went on to score 221 goals for Sunderland,Dykes, pp. 58‚Äì59. making him (as of 2009) the second highest goal-scorer in the club's history, behind Bob Gurney.Dykes, pp. 170‚Äì171. Other prominent players of that period's Sunderland was George Holley, who was league top scorer in the season before the title, and Scottish Charles Thomson who captained the club. First World War and inter-war period, 1913‚Äì1939 Sunderland finished in eighth place in 1914‚Äì15 Division One season, before World War I forced the break-up of the team as men went off to fight on the continent.Days, p. 95. Charlie Buchan and Bob Young each went on to win the Military Medal. After the resumption of the Football League following the war, Sunderland finished fifth in the 1919‚Äì20 season. To consolidate themselves in the First Division, Sunderland made several large money signings, including a world record fee of ¬£5,500 (¬£ today) for the signing of Warney Cresswell from South Shields.Days, p. 106. In the 1922‚Äì23 season they came close to another League championship title, finishing runners-up to Liverpool by six points with Buchan breaking the 30 goal mark.Days, pp. 107‚Äì108. In the 1923‚Äì24 season Sunderland were involved in a dispute with the English and Scottish national teams. Buchan and William Clunas had been called up by England and Scotland respectively. Sunderland were two points clear at the top of the table, but without Buchan and Clunas they travelled to Arsenal and were beaten 2‚Äì0, a defeat which helped cost them the title race for that season.Days, p. 109. In April 1925, Sunderland completed the signing of centre forward Dave Halliday, after Buchan left for Arsenal.Days, p. 114. In his second season Halliday scored 38 goals, helping Sunderland secure a third-place finish in the League.Days, pp. 117‚Äì118. In the 1928‚Äì29 season Halliday scored 43 goals, a club record for the most individual goals in a season.Days, p. 124. Kyle, who had been Sunderland's manager since 1905, resigned at the end of the 1928‚Äì29 season, after 25 seasons in charge of the club, managing 817 matches and taking Sunderland to the verge of a League and cup double.Days, p. 121. He was replaced by Johnny Cochrane, who arrived from St Mirren. With Cochrane in charge, Sunderland reached the 1930‚Äì31 FA Cup semi-final, where they lost to Birmingham City.Days, pp. 129‚Äì130. Sunderland's next success came in the 1934‚Äì35 season when they finished as runners-up to Arsenal.Days, pp. 137‚Äì138. The following season Sunderland managed to win their sixth League title, by a margin of eight points. They scored 109 goals during the season, with Raich Carter and Bobby Gurney each scoring 31.Days, pp. 139‚Äì142. Despite winning the league, the seasons did not go without tragedy. The young goalkeeper of the team, Jimmy Thorpe, died as a result of a kick in the head and chest after he had picked up the ball following a backpass in a game against Chelsea at Roker Park. He continued to take part until the match finished, but collapsed at home afterwards and died in hospital four days later from diabetes mellitus and heart failure 'accelerated by the rough usage of the opposing team.' The tragic end to Thorpe's career led to a change in the rules, where players were no longer allowed to raise their foot to a goalkeeper when he had control of the ball in his arms. The League championship led to Sunderland playing in the Charity Shield against FA Cup-winners Arsenal. Sunderland won the shield after goals from Eddie Burbanks and Raich Carter. Their success continued in the 1936‚Äì37 season, when they achieved their first FA Cup win. They beat Preston North End 3‚Äì1 in the final as Bobby Gurney, Raich Carter, and Eddie Burbanks all scored goals at Wembley Stadium.Days, pp. 143‚Äì146. Sunderland competed in the Charity Shield for a second successive season, this time against Manchester City who had won the League title in 1936‚Äì37; Sunderland were beaten 2‚Äì0. Their FA Cup success looked set to continue in the 1937‚Äì38 season, when they reached the semi- finals, but they were beaten 3‚Äì1 by Huddersfield Town, to end their chances.Days, pp. 147‚Äì148. Cochrane announced his retirement from management in 1939, after he had been in charge of Sunderland for 11 seasons, taking them to a League title, and an FA Cup win.Days, p. 149. Second World War and postwar period, 1939‚Äì1959 Sunderland's stadium for 99 years, Roker Park Bill Murray was appointed Sunderland's manager in 1939.Days, p. 150. On the outbreak of war the League competition was suspended shortly after the start of the 1939‚Äì40 season, halting the new manager's progress. The FA Cup was also suspended, but a replacement tournament, the Football League War Cup, was introduced. Sunderland took part in the two-legged War Cup final in the 1941‚Äì42 season, against Wolverhampton Wanderers. The first leg was drawn 2‚Äì2 at Roker Park, but Wolves won the return leg at Molineux 4‚Äì1 to win the trophy. During the war Roker Park suffered damage from bombs which destroyed the Roker End clubhouse; a police constable was killed while patrolling the stadium's perimeter.Days, p. 153. In the 1945‚Äì46 season, after the end of the war while the League was still suspended, the FA Cup resumed. Sunderland reached the fifth round where they were beaten by Birmingham City. The League resumed the following season, Sunderland finishing in ninth place.Days, pp. 157‚Äì158. In the 1947‚Äì48 season the club finished in twentieth place, on the brink of being relegated from the League's Division one for the first time.Days, pp. 159‚Äì160. In January 1949, Sunderland were involved in what is often regarded as the first case of a player transferring himself when they paid ¬£18,000 (¬£ today) for Carlisle United player-manager Ivor Broadis, who handled transfer negotiations himself. In the 1948‚Äì49 season, Sunderland visited Yeovil Town in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Yeovil were a non- League club at the time, but beat Division One side Sunderland 2‚Äì1 to knock them out of the Cup.Days, pp. 161‚Äì162. However, Sunderland's next season was more successful; they finished third in the League, and were its top scorers with 83 goals.Days, pp. 163‚Äì164. They also had the League's top goalscorer, Dickie Davis with 25 goals. In the 1950‚Äì51 season, Sunderland paid a world record transfer fee when signing Welsh striker Trevor Ford from Aston Villa, for ¬£30,000 (¬£ today), during a time when Sunderland were known as the \\"Bank of England club\\" because of their large money signings.Days, p. 169. For Sunderland, the immediate post-war years were characterised by significant spending; the club paid ¬£18,000 (¬£ today) for Carlisle United's Ivor Broadis in January 1949. Broadis was also Carlisle's manager at the time, and this is the first instance of a player transferring himself to another club. This, along with record-breaking transfer fees to secure the services of Len Shackleton and Welsh international Trevor Ford, led to a contemporary nickname, the \\"Bank of England club\\".Days, pp 169‚Äì170. The club finished third in the First Division in 1950, their highest finish since the 1936 championship. Len Shackleton, known as the \\"Clown Prince of Soccer\\", later admitted that the players were more a collection of talented individuals than a true team, and that \\"it takes time to harness and control a team of thoroughbreds. It took time to achieve the blend at Roker Park\\". Shackleton and centre-forward Trevor Ford would never build any kind of relationship on or off the pitch however, and Ford once threatened to never play in the same Sunderland team as Shackleton until he was forced to back down by manager Bill Murray. Ford was sold on to Cardiff City in November 1953. In January 1957, a letter was delivered to The Football Association (FA) from \\"Mr Smith\\", in which the author made allegations that Sunderland were making illegal payments to players.Days, pp. 183‚Äì184. The FA sent an investigation team, which found evidence of illegal payments in the Sunderland accounts, including a ¬£3,000 (¬£ today) bill, supposedly for straw to cover the pitch. The investigators uncovered a string of similar accounting glitches; contract companies were purposely charging Sunderland excessive fees for services, and later sending credit-notes to redress the balance. These credit notes were passed on to players. In total, just over ¬£5,000 (¬£ today) was handled in this way. The club's chairman and chief financial officer, along with three other club directors, were permanently suspended. Sunderland were fined ¬£5,000 (¬£ today), manager Murray was fined ¬£200 (¬£ today), and a number of players, including record-signing Trevor Ford were temporarily suspended‚Ç¨ from the game. In the aftermath of the event, manager Bill Murray was replaced by Alan Brown. In 1958, with Brown in charge, Sunderland were relegated from Division One for the first time in their history,Days, pp. 185‚Äì186. bringing their 68-year stay in England's top division to an end. Going into the final game of the season, they still had a chance of avoiding relegation, if they could win their game against Portsmouth and if Leicester City could be held by Birmingham City. Sunderland won their game 2‚Äì0, but Birmingham could not prevent Leicester from winning, thus Sunderland were relegated. FA Cup glory and Europe: 1959‚Äì1979 After Sunderland's first relegation from Division One in the 1957‚Äì58 season, the club at first languished in the lower half of Division Two, finishing the 1959‚Äì60 season in sixteenth place. Two finishes in third place followed in the 1961‚Äì62 and 1962‚Äì63 seasons, Sunderland in each case missing out on promotion by just one position. The 1961‚Äì62 season also saw the retirement of Brian Clough due to injury,Days, pp. 197‚Äì198. after he had scored 63 goals in 74 games for the club.Dykes, pp. 82‚Äì83. After six years in Division Two, Sunderland were promoted back to the First Division at the end of the 1963‚Äì64 season.Days, pp. 201‚Äì202. In 1964 Brown left his managerial post at Sunderland on appointment as manager of Sheffield Wednesday. After Sunderland had played through three months of the 1964‚Äì65 season without a manager, George Hardwick took over on a caretaker basis,Days, p. 205. until Ian McColl was appointed on a permanent basis at the end of the season.Days, p. 206. Brown returned for a second spell at Sunderland in 1968.Days, p. 215. After their promotion Sunderland failed to make an impact in Division One, never finishing higher than fifteenth in six years, after which they were relegated for the second time.Days, pp. 217‚Äì218. Billy Elliott, a former Sunderland player, took over after Brown's second departure,Days, p. 225. but managed the team for only four matches before former Newcastle United player Bob Stokoe was appointed as permanent manager. An intriguing interlude came about in 1967, when Sunderland spent a summer in North America playing in the United Soccer Association, a league which imported various international clubs. Sunderland worked in North America under the name Vancouver Royal Canadians, finishing fifth in the league's Western Division. In 1973, as a Second Division side, Sunderland reached the FA Cup Final, where they beat the cup-holders Leeds United. A first half goal by Scotsman Ian Porterfield was the only goal of the game. Jimmy Montgomery produced a double save, first from a Trevor Cherry header, and then from a shot by Peter Lorimer, to prevent Leeds from scoring. At the end of the game Sunderland manager Stokoe ran onto the pitch to embrace his goalkeeper, a gesture perpetuated by the statue currently standing outside the Stadium of Light.Days, p. 230. Only two other clubs, Southampton in 1976, and West Ham United in 1980, have since equalled Sunderland's achievement of lifting the FA Cup while playing outside the top tier of English football. In 1973, Bobby Knoxall recorded \\"Sunderland All The Way\\" for the 1973 FA Cup Final record. The FA Cup win in 1973 meant that Sunderland, for the first time in their history, had qualified for a European competition, in this case the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. They were first drawn against Hungarian side Vasas Budapest, who they beat 3‚Äì0 on aggregate. In the next round Sunderland were drawn against Sporting Lisbon. They won the first leg 2‚Äì1 at Roker Park, but in the return leg in Lisbon they were beaten 2‚Äì0, and were thus knocked out of the competition in the second round. In 1976 Sunderland were again promoted to the First Division, as Division Two champions.Days, pp. 235‚Äì236. Stokoe became ill during the 1976‚Äì77 season; he stepped down from the job, and was replaced temporarily by caretaker manager Ian MacFarlane. McFarlane's stay was short, and he was replaced by Jimmy Adamson in 1976. After promotion in the previous season, Sunderland were relegated back to the Second Division.Days, pp. 239‚Äì240. Adamson managed them for just two seasons before resigning to move to Leeds United.Days, p. 245. In a flurry of many managers in a short time period, David Merrington took over as caretaker manager. Billy Elliot then joined Sunderland as manager for a second time, replacing Merrington until the end of the season. Two cup finals: 1979‚Äì1997 Sunderland celebrated their centenary in the 1979‚Äì80 season with a testimonial match. They played an \\"England XI\\", featuring players from Newcastle United and from Middlesbrough; they lost the game 2‚Äì0.Days, p. 247. In 1979, after Elliot ended his spell, Ken Knighton took the vacant manager's position. Knighton managed Sunderland for 94 games, leading them in his first season to second place in Division Two, and promotion to the First Division,Days, pp. 247‚Äì248. However, he was sacked the following season, when Sunderland were struggling near the bottom of Division One.Days, pp. 251‚Äì252. Mick Docherty was brought in as caretaker manager until the end of the 1980‚Äì81 season, and helped them avoid relegation.Days, p. 252. The activity in the Sunderland manager's seat continued, with Alan Durban's appointment in 1981.Days, p. 253. He lasted two years, before being sacked in the 1983‚Äì84 season after a defeat by Manchester United. Former player Pop Robson was brought in for a single game,Days, p. 257. before Len Ashurst's appointment as regular manager. In the 1984‚Äì85 season Ashurst led Sunderland to their first League Cup final, where they lost 1‚Äì0 to Norwich through an own goal from Gordon Chisholm, after Clive Walker had missed a penalty for Sunderland. At the end of the season Sunderland were relegated back to the Second Division, and Ashurst was sacked.Days, p. 263. Lawrie McMenemy was brought in as manager in 1985, but Sunderland reached the lowest point in their history in 1987, when they suffered relegation to the Third Division after losing a two-leg play-off to Gillingham. The return of 1973 FA Cup winning manager Bob Stokoe,Days, pp. 265‚Äì266. appointed caretaker manager following the sacking of McMenemy, could not help Sunderland avoid relegation. It was the first time in their history that they had fallen into the Third Division. However, under new manager Denis Smith, promotion was gained at the first attempt; Sunderland returned to the Second Division as Third Division champions in 1988. Peter Reid was appointed Sunderland manager in 1997, and served until 2002 Two years later, Sunderland reached the Second Division play-off final, after beating Newcastle United in the semi-final. During the second leg of the semi-final at St. James' Park, some Newcastle fans, seeing their team down 2‚Äì0 with only five minutes remaining, invaded the pitch in the hope of forcing an abandonment.Days, pp. 275‚Äì276. However, the game was resumed and Sunderland completed the win. In the play-off final, Sunderland lost 1‚Äì0 against Swindon Town at Wembley. However Sunderland were promoted a few weeks later in place of Swindon, who were kept in the Second Division after admitting financial irregularities. After just one season in the First Division, Sunderland were relegated again. They subsequently struggled in Division Two, in 1991‚Äì92. However, in that season Sunderland embarked on a run leading to the FA Cup final, where they lost 2‚Äì0 to Liverpool, They had previously beaten Chelsea in a quarter-final replay. Smith had quit as manager during the season, and was replaced by his assistant Malcolm Crosby.Days, pp. 284‚Äì285. He in turn resigned after less than a year, and was replaced by the ex-England player Terry Butcher.Days, pp. 287‚Äì288. Before the end of 1993, Butcher's reign as manager came to an end after 45 games in charge, and he was replaced by Mick Buxton.Days, p. 290. In a period which included six managers in ten years, Buxton was sacked in 1995.Days, p. 291. Sunderland's board turned to Peter Reid as temporary manager, in the hopes of keeping Sunderland clear of relegation.Days, p. 292. That objective was achieved within weeks, and Reid was rewarded with a permanent contract. Reid's first full season as Sunderland manager, 1995‚Äì96, was successful; the club won the Division One title and gained promotion to the Premier League for the first time since the League restructuring which had taken effect in 1992‚Äì93.Days, pp. 293‚Äì294. In the 1996‚Äì97 season, despite beating Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea they were relegated. In 1998, BBC broadcast a six-part documentary named Premier Passions. It chronicled Sunderland A.F.C. during the 1996‚Äì97 season, in which the club was relegated from the Premier League, the year after winning promotion from the Football League First Division, and the move to Stadium of Light. New stadium: 1997‚Äì2008 In the 1996‚Äì97 season Sunderland relocated to the 42,000-seat Stadium of Light at Monkwearmouth, after 99 years at Roker Park. Fans reaction was mixed, and following the demolition of Roker Park, playwright Tom Kelly and actor Paul Dunn created a one-man play called \\"I Left My Heart at Roker Park\\" about a fan struggling with the move and what Roker Park meant for him - the play originally ran in 1997, and had a few revivals sincehttps://rokerreport.sbnation.com/2014/8/11/5990401/i-left-my- heart-at-roker-park-roker-report-meets-paul- dunnhttps://thepauldunn.co.uk/projects/past-projects/2014-2/i-left-my-heart- in-roker-park-by-tom- kelly/https://www.britishtheatreguide.info/reviews/rokerpark- revhttps://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/share-your-stadium-of-light- tales-357411. Actor and Sunderland supporter Peter O'Toole, described Roker Park as his last connection to the club and that everything \\"they meant to him was when they were at Roker Park\\" and that as a result he wasn't as much a fan as he used to be.https://bleacherreport.com/articles/855822#slide0https://wearsideonline.com/peter- otoole-dies/ The stadium's capacity was later expanded to 49,000 seats, making it the fourth largest club stadium in England. In recognition of the historical importance of the mining industry in the club's main area of support, a Davy Lamp currently stands outside the stadium. The Stadium of Light In their first full season at the new ground, 1997‚Äì98, Sunderland finished third in Division One. After beating Sheffield United in the Football League play-offs semi-final, they reached the final at Wembley with a place in the Premier League at stake. Over 40,000 fans travelled from the North-East to see the game against Charlton Athletic. The match was drawn 4‚Äì4 after extra time had been played; Charlton, however, won the game on a penalty shootout, after Michael Gray had his penalty saved by Charlton goalkeeper Sa≈°a Iliƒá. In the 1998‚Äì99 season Sunderland secured their Premier League place by winning the Division One title with a then record 105 League points. They clinched promotion at Bury by winning 5‚Äì2. Kevin Phillips won the European Golden Shoe in his first top-flight season with Sunderland, scoring 30 goals. In September 2001, Sunderland chairman Bob Murray announced the separation of Sunderland's charitable and community work from the mainstream club activity, and the independent SAFC Foundation was created.. Later, the foundation came to be known as the Foundation of Light. In 2001‚Äì02 Sunderland narrowly avoided relegation. They were the lowest scoring team in the Premier League, with 29 goals, ending the season in seventeenth place and being knocked out of both English Cup competitions in their first rounds. In 2002‚Äì03 they finished at bottom of the Premier League, with 4 wins, 21 goals, and 19 points, an English Premiership record low at that time. Reid had been sacked as manager in October and been replaced by Howard Wilkinson, with Steve Cotterill as his assistant. Wilkinson's reign was unsuccessful, and he left the club after only six months in charge. Former Republic of Ireland manager Mick McCarthy came to the club in March 2003, but could not prevent relegation. In the 2003‚Äì04 season Sunderland finished third in Division One, and only a penalty shoot-out defeat at the hands of Crystal Palace prevented them from reaching the play- off final for a promotion place. In the 2004‚Äì05 season, Sunderland finished at the top of the table in Division One, now rechristened the Football League Championship, and thus returned to the Premier League. The 2005‚Äì06 season was poor for Sunderland, as they failed to win a home game before Christmas and were eventually relegated with a new record lowest points tally of 15, breaking their own previous record of 19. McCarthy was sacked in March and replaced by caretaker manager Kevin Ball. He took Sunderland to their first home win of the season, a 2‚Äì1 victory over Fulham. On 6 August 2007, Sunderland celebrated 10 years at the Stadium of Light with a draw against Juventus, and prepared for the oncoming season by spending nearly ¬£40 million on new players for the squad, whilst also breaking the British transfer record for a goalkeeper with the ¬£9 million transfer of Craig Gordon. Sunderland secured their Premier League status for the 2008‚Äì09 season after a derby victory over Middlesbrough, and with teams below failing to win. On 25 October 2008, Sunderland defeated rivals Newcastle United 2‚Äì1 at the Stadium of Light, their first home win over them since 1980, and the first time they had ever defeated them at that ground. on 4 December 2008, Keane left Sunderland after a run of defeats in the Premier League. First-team coach Ricky Sbragia took over as caretaker manager, and on 27 December 2008 Sbragia took the job on a permanent basis, signing an 18-month contract. Despite promising early results, the team continued to struggle and narrowly avoided relegation from the Premiership on the last day of the season, after which Sbragia resigned from his post. 2008-Present Irish-American tycoon Ellis Short completed a full takeover of the club from the Irish Drumaville Consortium, and Steve Bruce was announced as the new manager on 3 June 2008. After being named Sunderland's Young Player of the Year for two seasons in a row,https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland- afcs-academy-graduates-now-15359267 at the end of the 2010-11 season, Jordan Henderson was transferred to Liverpool FC, where he went on to become captain and win the Champions League.https://talksport.com/football/550057/liverpool- damien-comolli-jordan-henderson-super-cup-champions- league/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/klopp- henderson-gerrard-champions-league-16635323 Despite signing numerous new players before the 2012‚Äì13 season, Sunderland endured a difficult start to the season, with their first victory not coming until late September against Wigan. Despite the ¬£5 million signing of Danny Graham in January, Sunderland suffered a further slump, taking just 3 points from eight games, and with the threat of relegation looming, manager Martin O'Neill was sacked on March 30, following a 1‚Äì0 home defeat by Manchester United. Paolo Di Canio was announced has his replacement the following day, bringing his own backroom staff. The appointment prompted the immediate resignation of club Vice Chairman David Miliband due to Di Canio's \\"past political statements\\". The appointment of Di Canio also sparked opposition from the Durham Miners' Association, which threatened to remove one of its mining banners from Sunderland's Stadium of Light, which is built on the former site of the Wearmouth Colliery, as a symbol of its anger over the appointment. The background to the opposition was past statements made by Di Canio supporting Fascism. In his first season, Paolo Di Canio succeeded in keeping Sunderland in the Premier League, but the 2013‚Äì14 season proved to be less of a success, and Di Canio was sacked after picking up just one point in five league games. On 8 October 2013 when Gus Poyet was appointed manager of Sunderland. Poyet took over at Sunderland during the 2013-14 Premier League campaign. Although he had a rough start to his tenure as Sunderland manager, suffering a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Swansea in his first match in charge, Poyet ended up securing Premier League safety in the penultimate game of the season. He also took Sunderland to the League Cup Final in the same season, defeating Manchester United in penalty kicks in the semi-finals. These achievements earned Poyet a new two-year contract with the club on 28 May 2014. The following season was less of a success for Gus Poyet, with Sunderland just above the bottom three after a 4‚Äì0 defeat to Aston Villa on 14 March 2015. Two days after the defeat, the club sacked Poyet due to the bad run of results that left Sunderland in 17th, just one point above the relegation zone. Sunderland finished the 2016-17 season 20th in the Premier League and were relegated to the Championship. Manager Sam Allardyce was sacked during the season and replaced by David Moyes, but that did not change the club's fortunes. In June 2017, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, a product of Sunderland's academy who joined the club aged eight, was transferred to Everton for a fee of ¬£25 million, rising to a possible ¬£30 million, a record for a British goalkeeper. Sunderland finished the 2017-18 season 24th in the Championship and found themselves in EFL League One, a second relegation in a row. The events of the season formed the backdrop to the documentary series Sunderland 'Til I Die which was released on Netflix on 14 December 2018. Sunderland finished their season having had four managers. David Moyes, who had overseen the previous seasons relegation, resigned and was replaced by Simon Grayson. He was subsequently replaced by Chris Coleman. Due to the success of the first season, a second season of Sunderland 'Til I Die was confirmed by Netflix, despite many in the club opposing it. In April 2018, the team was purchased by a consortium lead by Stewart Donald, with Ellis Short selling it after a second successive relegation to League One. Steward Donald agreed to sell Eastleigh so that he could own Sunderland. On 21 May, he officially became owner of Sunderland, doing so without the consortium to speed the transition.

This is the only episode in which the character of George Costanza does not appear and one of two episodes in which Kramer does not appear (the other being \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\"). Additionally, this episode is the first appearance of Morty's rival Jack Klompus and of Uncle Leo's wife (and Jerry's aunt) Stella. Plot Jerry and Elaine go to Florida to visit Jerry's parents Morty and Helen at the Pines of Mar Gables Phase II for the weekend and plan on going scuba diving (which Helen doesn't see the point in doing). Morty is also being honored at a ceremony the next night. Jack Klompus and his wife Doris come over to write Morty a check for a previous night's dinner and Jerry notices Jack's pen. When Jerry asks Jack about it, Jack tells him that it can write upside down and that astronauts use it in space. Jack offers an interested Jerry the pen. Jerry refuses his offer several times, but Jack persists and Jerry finally gives in. Helen asks why he took the pen and says he should give it back because Doris will tell everyone in the condo that Jerry made Jack give it to him. That night, Elaine sleeps on a sofa bed with a bar that sticks up through the mattress and hurts her back, making her extremely uncomfortable while not being helped by the fact that the air conditioning is turned off, since Jerry's parents are \\"nuts about temperature\\". Jerry tries to comfort her by saying they only have two more days left before they go back to New York. The next morning, Elaine's back is so sore that she cannot go scuba diving with Jerry, so he goes without her. Morty suggests she take muscle relaxants to ease the pain. Just as Helen predicted, their neighbor Evelyn tells the Seinfelds about the rumors that are beginning to spread around the Pines of Mar Gables Phase II that Jerry wanted Jack to give him the pen. When Jerry returns, he has black eyes because the capillaries around his eyes burst when he went underwater and the pressure was too tight on his mask. Jack comes over again and Jerry returns the pen. Morty berates Jack for \\"taking Jerry's pen\\". Elaine decides she wants to take the muscle relaxants, but takes a slight overdose and acts goofily at the ceremony. Jerry has to wear sunglasses because of his black eyes. At the dinner, Uncle Leo and Aunt Stella arrive to watch the event. Jack is the MC and turns the dinner into a \\"roast\\", making cracks about Morty at the podium. Morty starts arguing with Jack again about taking back the pen and they start fighting, breaking Jack's dental plate in the process, prompting a bitter Jack to sue Morty. The next day, a chiropractor looks at Elaine's back and tells her she should not go anywhere for at least five days, extending both her and Jerry's stay even longer much to their discomfort. Evelyn appears and tells Morty and Helen that it would take five votes to get them thrown out. She also says her nephew Larry is a good lawyer and offers to have him represent Morty should Jack press charges against Morty. Production The Pen is the only episode to not feature the character of George Costanza. Jason Alexander threatened to quit the show after the table read only featured two of the main cast actors, Jerry and Elaine. Alexander would later admit that this was caused by insecurity on his part as he was worried that Louis-Dreyfus's role would cause George's role to be diminished over time.

Archaeology Kestel is a probable site of Bronze Age tin mining in the Taurus Mountains in ancient Anatolia (now Turkey). Tin was as scarce and valuable as petroleum is today in the Bronze Age. It was a vital ingredient of bronze, used with copper to make the alloy. K. Aslihan Yener spent years in archaeometallurgy surveys together with the Turkish Geological Survey (MTA) and found cassiterite (tin ore) crystals in a stream in the Taurus foothills. This ore is purple; previous searches had been looking for black ore because most tin ores are black. Near the site was a deserted valley with a hill called Kestel that proved to hold a tin mine. Additionally, fragments of Bronze Age pottery were found in and near the mine. Inside, there were veins of bright purple tin ore. The Kestel mine has two miles (3 km) of tunnels, many of which are only about two feet wide, just large enough to allow children to do the mining work. In one abandoned shaft, a burial of twelve to fifteen children was found, presumably killed while working in the mine. In 1989, on a hill opposite the mine, associates found piles of Bronze Age pottery, close to 50,000 ground stone tools and evidence that this site had been continuously occupied from 3290‚Äì1840 BC. A great deal of the city was semi subterranean. The pottery at the site (named G√∂ltepe) provided the final proof of the tin industry in the Bronze Age. Many thick crucibles lined with slag were found at the site and tests revealed the slag to have very high concentrations of tin (30% to almost 100%). It is likely that after the ore nuggets were washed, stone tools were used to grind them to a powder, and then the powder was heated to melt out the tin. All of this can be accomplished with Bronze Age tools and methods. This was somewhat surprising because early Assyrian records indicated that they imported tin into Anatolia, suggesting that the area did not have a supply of its own. In turn, the Assyrians imported large quantities of tin from Afghanistan. The Kestel mine stopped producing at the end of the third millennium BC.

He served as the founding president of the Community College of Vermont, the founding president of California State University, Monterey Bay, and as assistant director general for education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Peter Smith is currently serving as Senior Vice President for Academic Strategies and Development at Kaplan Higher Education Corporation, a global education company owned by the Graham Holding Company. At KHE, he has spearheaded efforts to personalize degree programs and learning support systems, while strengthening their outcomes-based pedagogy at the program and course level. Smith is also developing new market positions and services for the adult postsecondary education market. Early life and education Smith was born in Boston, Massachusetts, and was raised in Burlington, Vermont. He is the son of Burlington banker and Vermont State Senator Frederick P. Smith. He graduated from Phillips Academy in 1964 and received an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1968 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"Burlington, Vermont, 1791-1848: A Study of Economic Development and Social Change in a Community.\\" In 1970, he received a M.A.T. from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education. He received his Ed.D. from the Harvard Graduate School of Education in administration, planning, and social policy in 1983. Career in education and politics Smith served one year as an assistant to the Vermont Commissioner of Education. In 1970, he became the founding president of the Community College of Vermont, a Vermont State College. He first ran for office in 1978, defeating incumbent Lieutenant Governor of Vermont T. Garry Buckley in the Republican primaryVermont Secretary of State, Election results: 1978 Republican primary, 2006, page 1 but losing the general election to Democrat Madeleine M. Kunin. Between 1981 and 1983, he served as a Vermont State Senator representing the Washington County district. After Kunin chose not to run for re-election in 1982, Smith was elected to succeed her. He served two, two-year terms. He ran for Governor of Vermont in 1986 but was defeated by Kunin. After two years as Vice President of Development at Norwich University he was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1988 for Vermont's at-large congressional district with 41.2% of the vote. In 1990, he was defeated in his bid for re-election by Independent Bernie Sanders. As of 2020, he is the last Republican to have represented Vermont in the U.S. House. Funded by a Mina Shaughnessy Fellowship, Smith wrote Your Hidden Credentials: The Value of Personal Learning Outside College, (Acropolis Books, Ltd, 1986). The book, now out-of-print, promotes college credit for life experience. Smith is also the author of The Quiet Crisis: How Higher Education Is Failing America, (Anker Publishing Company, Inc.,2004) which received juried acclaim from the American Association of Continuing Education. His third book, Harnessing America's Wasted Talent: New Dimensions for Higher Education (Jossey-Bass, 2010) was published in early 2010. His fourth book, Free-range Learning in the Digital Age: The Emerging Revolution in College, Career, and Education (SelectBooks) was published in 2018. From 1991 to 1994, Smith served as dean of the Graduate School of Education and Human Development at George Washington University. In 1991, he also served as executive director of the U.S. Commission on Responsibilities for Financing Postsecondary Education. In 1994, due in part to his work in assessment at GWU, the California State University recruited Smith as founding president of California State University, Monterey Bay, a post that he vacated in 2005. Beginning June 20, 2005, Smith served as assistant director general for education of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Work at UNESCO At UNESCO, Smith's education experience was expressed by his concern for the wellbeing of learners: \\"Quality is an issue,\\" says Smith. \\"UNESCO has long encouraged the internationalization of education and the involvement of a range of partners, but we must also protect students from inadequate learning resources, low-quality provisions, degree mills and bogus institutions.\\" After assuming the post of Assistant Director General (ADG) for Education of UNESCO, Smith made several moves based on his mandate from UNESCO's General Conference and from its Director General in an attempt to reform the Education Sector of the institution. These included developing UNESS, a simplified national education support strategy; a Global Action Plan; involvement with the G8 and the World Economic Forum; restructuring the headquarter's governance structure; and implementing a de-centralization plan for UNESCO's Education Sector. After an intensive one-year study contracted out to Navigant Consulting, all but three of over 50 recommendations were approved for implementation by the Director General in June, 2006. Political fallout to the approved reforms led to anonymous charges of financial improprieties in the awarding of contracts totaling USD $2.2 million to Navigant Consulting without proper UNESCO oversight. Smith was found to have used an established, but alternative bidding procedure in the UNESCO rules. The UNESCO Executive Board ultimately resolved to clarify and strengthen the bid procedures at UNESCO. In March, 2007, having received a death threat at his home, Smith offered his resignation. University of Maryland University College In April 2016, University of Maryland University College announced that Smith had been appointed to a two-year term as the Orkand Endowed Chair and Professor of Innovative Practices in Higher Education. In this position, Smith is responsible for identifying and implementing measures to improve delivery of the school's learning and support services.  Later career Smith was one of thirty former Republican congressmen to sign a letter opposing Donald Trump's candidacy for President. Family He is the older brother of former state representative Charles Plympton Smith. References Bibliography * Smith, Peter P.

Normally, when this occurs, an effort is made on the part of authorities to recapture them and return them to their original detainers. Escaping from prison is also a criminal offense in some countries, such as the United States and Canada, and it is highly likely to result in time being added to the inmate's sentence, as well as the inmate being placed under increased security that is most likely a maximum security prison or supermax prison. In some other places like Germany and a number of other countries, it is considered human nature to want to escape from a prison and it is considered as a violation of the right of freedom, so escape is not penalized in itself (in the absence of other factors such as threats of violence, actual violence, or property damage). Many prisons use security features such as motion detectors, CCTV, barred windows, high walls, barbed wire, razor wire, and electric fencing to prevent escapes. Methods Numerous methods have been used to escape prison over time. Many escapes have been successfully conducted by inmates who have invented their own methods. Weaknesses that are found as prisoners escape are often corrected at numerous prisons around the world to prevent future escapes in a similar manner. This leads inmates to finding new ways. Since prisoners usually have a lot of time in which they are doing nothing, this gives them plenty of time to think, allowing them to devise plans and figure out ways to escape. The following are methods that have commonly been used by prisoners in escapes. In some instances, a combination of these are used. =Cell escape= While some prisoners are allowed out of their cells at times, others remain locked in their cells most of the time, particularly those in solitary confinement. Many prisoners who are kept in their cells must find ways out of the cells. Even those who are allowed out of their cells at times still have plans that involve escape from their cells. Cell escapes occur through either the door, the window, the light, the ventilation system, by breaking down the walls, or by tunneling underground. Some prisoners have escaped by [Lock pickingpicking the locks on their cells, creating keys to their cells, sawing bars off of the doors or windows, carving away the walls, or breaking away the vent. =Containment penetration= Breaking down or slipping through the physical containment of the prison, including that of the cell itself or the surrounding complex. Methods include the destruction of the cell or compound walls, squeezing through tight spaces, or entering off-limits areas. Prisoners often destroy their containment with homemade tools, smuggled objects, or other contraband. Most prisons are contained on the outside by one or more fences, often topped with barbed wire or razor wire. Escapees manage to scale these fences successfully or cut holes in the fences, damaging them. These fences are also watched by one or more guards from a tower, but escapees manage to pass the fence when the guard is turned away, unable to see in the dark, or sleeping on the job. Outside the fences is often a perimeter patrol conducted by an officer in a vehicle, which stands as the final line of defense. Escapees manage to evade this by studying the length of time between passes or waiting until it is on the other side or using the cover of darkness. A rare method that has been used at times involves the digging of a tunnel under the facility that exits outside the facility. =Physical force= Attacking guards with blunt force, homemade weapons, smuggled weapons, or weapons stolen from overtaken guards. Some escapes involve one or more inmates taking over an entire unit or section of the prison, subduing guards, and stealing weapons or other objects they can use to their advantage. =Deception= Deception may involve fooling one or more guards into believing the prisoner is authorized to depart prison grounds for a legitimate reason, or the prisoner disguising himself or herself as a worker or civilian who can exit prison grounds without arousing suspicion, or the creation of a ruse to mislead guards. In some escapes, inmates construct makeshift dummies to make guards believe they are in their cells, usually in bed, when they are not. This enables the inmate to gain a head start from the prison before guards discover they are actually missing. Such dummies are typically constructed quite crudely, often using the inmate's or another's hair, shoes, and miscellaneous materials for stuffing, hidden under a blanket to give the appearance a body is present. =Exploitation of weaknesses= Finding holes in the security of the facility, and taking advantage of them. This may include the discovery of overlooked security issues, or taking advantage of guards who are not following policies or procedures, or are otherwise not doing their jobs properly. =Exploitation of corruption= Taking advantage of intentional wrongdoing on part of prison staff. This may include the use of weapons or other contraband smuggled in by staff, or receiving assistance from staff who believe in that inmate's freedom and willingly assist. =Failure to return= Some lower security inmates are permitted to leave prison grounds temporarily on the honor they will return. These include those who depart for employment outside the facility or furloughs that allow time outside for periods of time. =Escape from outside= Breaking while in custody outside facility grounds. Prisoners are often transported for work duties, to be moved between facilities, attend court hearings, for hospitalization and medical appointments, and other reasons. =Outside help= Receiving aid from an accomplice outside prison walls, including those who provide a ride to the inmate following their penetration, smuggle in contraband as visitors, use helicopters, among other methods. When a banned item is smuggled, it can either be slipped through or tossed over the fence from outside, hidden in a gift to the inmate that is legal, or slipped past corrupt security officers. In some cases, the staff are the source of the smuggling themselves. =Escape from island prisons= Escaping from an island prison brings another challenge of crossing the water to free land. This can be done by construction of a makeshift raft or receiving outside help from the owner of a boat. In the famed 1962 Alcatraz escape, a makeshift raft from raincoats was confirmed. One additional theory is that a boat was used to transport them in the water. Prevention Prevention of prison escape includes the numerous security measures that are in effect. How many and which measures are used depends on the security level and specific institution. Some of the preventive measures are: =Structural= * One or more fences surrounding the facility * Barbed wire or razor wire on topping fences that surround the facility * Razor wire on the ground between fences, thereby making one's presence in this area dangerous and possibly deadly * Multiple locked doors between the \\"pods\\" (sections of cells) and the exit * Cell windows are too narrow for a human body to fit through =Guard placement= * Rounds: Guards within the facility make rounds checking inmates at set intervals * Full-time watch: High-risk inmates are watched non-stop around the clock one-on-one * Guard towers: Guards in towers at corners of compound can observe edges of the facility and are often authorized to use deadly force against fleeing escapees * Perimeter patrol: A guard in a vehicle circles the compound from the outside, watching for escaping inmates =Technology= * Surveillance cameras allow guards to monitor areas of the compound without being physically present there * Security lighting provides nighttime visibility of exterior areas, including entrances, exercise yards and perimeter fencing * Microwave motion sensors alert security if an inmate nears the fence * Thermal cameras detect heat signatures and can notify guards if an inmate (or other unauthorized person) is present in a restricted area or moving towards the fence * Alarms, buzzers, or sirens make guards aware if any doors or gates are open, signifying a possible breach * Perimeter intrusion detection systems sound an alarm if fences are climbed or cut. Some systems also provide guards with live audio feedback =Routine= * Head counts at set times to ensure the number of inmates actually in the facility matches the number on record * Cell searches to make sure inmates do not have contraband that can be used to aid an escape or commit violence against guards or other inmates Punishment In some jurisdictions, including the United States, escaping from jail or prison is a criminal offense. In Virginia, for instance, the punishment for escape depends on whether the offender escaped by using force or violence or setting fire to the jail, and the seriousness of the offense for which they were imprisoned.\\"¬ß 18.2-477.

In Mexico, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria, the philosophy of the law holds that it is human nature to want to escape. In those countries, escapees who do not break any other laws are not charged and no extra time is added to their sentence. However, in Mexico, officers are allowed to shoot prisoners attempting to escape, and an escape is illegal if violence is used against prison personnel or property, or if prison inmates or officials aid the escape.\\"More on the Kaplan Caper\\" .

He markets dietary supplements and medical devices, some of which are controversial. Until 2013, Mercola operated the \\"Dr. Mercola Natural Health Center\\" (formerly the \\"Optimal Wellness Center\\") in Schaumburg, Illinois. He wrote the books The No-Grain Diet (with Alison Rose Levy) and The Great Bird Flu Hoax. On his website, Mercola and colleagues advocate a number of unproven alternative health notions including homeopathy and opposition to vaccination. These positions have faced persistent criticism. Mercola is a member of the political advocacy group Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which promotes scientifically discredited views about medicine and disease, and several other alternative medicine organizations. Mercola's medical claims have been criticized by the medical, scientific, regulatory, and business communities. A 2006 BusinessWeek editorial stated his marketing practices relied on \\"slick promotion, clever use of information, and scare tactics.\\" In 2005, 2006, and 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Mercola and his company that they were making illegal claims for their products' ability to detect, prevent, and treat disease.Tsouderos, Trine; Tribune reporter. (April 26, 2011). \\"FDA warns doctor: Stop touting camera as disease screening tool\\", Chicago Tribune. Retrieved January 12, 2011. The medical watchdog site Quackwatch has criticized Mercola for making \\"unsubstantiated claims [that] clash with those of leading medical and public health organizations and many unsubstantiated recommendations for dietary supplements.\\" Of Mercola's marketing techniques, oncology surgeon David Gorski says it \\"mixes the boring, sensible health advice with pseudoscientific advice in such a way that it‚Äôs hard for someone without a medical background to figure out which is which.\\"  Life and career  Joseph Mercola was born July 8, 1954 in Chicago Illinois. His mother, Jeanette Aldridge (n√©e Freeman) was a waitress and his father, Thomas Nicholas Mercola, was an Air Force veteran who worked for Marshall Fields. Mercola attended Lane Tech College Prep High School and went on to study biology and chemistry at the University of Illinois, graduating in 1976. In 1982, he graduated from the Chicago College of Osteopathic Medicine (now Midwestern University). According to Mercola's website, he is a former Chairman of Family Medicine at St. Alexius Medical Center. He stopped seeing patients in 2009 to work full-time on his health products and vitamin supplements business. He has written two books which have been listed on the New York Times bestseller list: The No-Grain Diet (May 2003) and The Great Bird Flu Hoax (October 2006). In the bird flu book, Mercola dismisses medical concerns over an avian influenza pandemic, asserting that the government, big business, and the mainstream media have conspired to promote the threat of avian flu in order to accrue money and power. Mercola has appeared on The Dr. Oz Show and The Doctors.  Views and controversy  Mercola operates Mercola.com, which he has described as the most popular alternative-health website on the internet. Aside from the main site, it also hosts various blog subsites, like Healthy Pets and Peak Fitness. Traffic counting from Quantcast shows the site receives about 1.9 million novel visitors per month, each returning almost ten times each month; the number of views are roughly equal to those received by the National Institutes of Health. The site and his company, Mercola LLC, brought in roughly $7 million in 2010 through the sale of a variety of alternative medicine treatments and dietary supplements. The site promotes a number of disproven health ideas, including the notion that homeopathy can treat autism, and that vaccinations have hidden detriments to human health. An article in BusinessWeek criticized his website as using aggressive direct-marketing tactics, writing: Phyllis Entis, a microbiologist and food safety expert, highlighted Mercola.com as an example of websites \\"likely to mislead consumers by offering one-sided, incomplete, inaccurate, or misleading information.\\" In 2016, Mercola agreed to pay up to $5.3 million restitution after federal regulators complained that he made false claims about tanning beds that he sold. = Vaccinations = Mercola has been highly critical of vaccines and vaccination policy, claiming that too many vaccines are given too soon during infancy. He hosts anti-vaccination activists on his website, advocates other measures rather than vaccination in many cases such as using vitamin D rather than a flu shot despite the data not being conclusive and strongly criticizes influenza vaccines. Mercola is viewed by many as an anti-vaccine propagandist. As of 2019, he has donated at least $4 million to anti-vaccine groups though his Natural Health Research Foundation, including more than $2.9 million to the anti-vaccination group the National Vaccine Information Center, amounting to about 40 percent of that organization's funding.Satija, Neena and Lena H. Sun (2019-12-20). \\"A major funder of the anti-vaccine movement has made millions selling natural health products\\". Washington Post. Retrieved 2019-12-20. He co-funded an anti-vaccination ad in Times Square in 2011. Mercola has asserted that thimerosal, a vaccine preservative, is harmful due to its mercury content. Thimerosal has been removed from most vaccines given to young children in the U.S., with no effect on rates of autism diagnosis. Extensive evidence has accumulated since 1999 showing that this preservative is safe, with the World Health Organization stating in 2006 that \\"there is no evidence of toxicity in infants, children or adults exposed to thimerosal in vaccines.\\" =Other views= Other controversial views Mercola supports include: *Dietary recommendations on food consumption that often put him at odds with mainstream dietary advice. *Advocacy on the labeling and health of genetically modified food,The Atlantic Want to Know If Your Food Is Genetically Modified? By Molly Ball MAY 14, 2014 as well as for their elimination entirely from the market. *Claims that microwaving food alters its chemistry, despite consensus that microwaving food does not adversely affect nutrient content compared to conventionally prepared food. *Opposition to homogenization, claiming that homogenized milk has little nutritional value and contributes to a variety of negative health effects, despite scientists considering that belief \\"tenuous and implausible\\", stating \\"Experimental evidence has failed to substantiate, and in many cases has refuted, the xanthine oxidase/plasmalogen depletion hypothesis.\\" *Questioning whether HIV is the cause of AIDS, claiming manifestations of AIDS (including opportunistic infections and death) may be the result of \\"psychological stress\\" brought on by the belief that HIV is harmful. The scientific community considers the evidence that HIV causes AIDS conclusive. Mercola.com has also featured positive presentations of the claims of AIDS denialists, a fringe group which denies the role of HIV in causing AIDS. *Claiming cancer risks arise from mobile phone radiation,New York Times The Health Concerns in Wearable Tech which is pseudoscientific.Margaret Sullivan on the New York Times' Public Editor's Journal Opinion Pages Blog .

This view is not held by mainstream medical science; in 2011, the National Toxicology Program stated that \\"Protection against photodamage by use of broad-spectrum sunscreens is well-documented as an effective means of reducing total lifetime UV dose and, thereby, preventing or ameliorating the effects of UV radiation on both the appearance and biomechanical properties of the skin.\\"Photococarcinogenesis Study of Retinoic Acid and Retinyl Palmitate , draft technical report, National Toxicology Program *In 2020, Mercola claimed that inhaling 0.5-3% hydrogen peroxide solution using a nebulizer could prevent or cure COVID-19.

It is a free and open standard for connecting the output from a graphics processing unit in a laptop, tablet computer, flat panel display, or LCD television to the display panel's timing controller. Most laptops, tablet computers, flat-panel monitors, and TVs use this interface internally.  FPD-Link and LVDS  Texas Instruments FlatLink Transmitter SN75LVDS83B FPD-Link was the first large-scale application of the low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) standard. National Semiconductor immediately provided interoperability specifications for the FPD-Link technology in order to promote it as a free and open standard, and thus other IC suppliers were able to copy it. FlatLink by TI was the first interoperable version of FPD-Link. Basic LVDS circuit By the end of the twentieth century, the major notebook computer manufacturers created the Standard Panels Working Group (SPWG) and made FPD-Link / FlatLink the standard for transferring graphics and video through the notebook's hinge.  Transferring the RGB video-interface  FPD-Link became successful at transmitting 18-bit RGB raw video because it reduced the cable size and improved the electromagnetic compatibility by using LVDS. It uses LVDS to transmit the video data on three twisted pair, and another pair to transmit the LVDS clock signal. These four differential pairs are carrying the same information previously transferred over 22 wires, which is almost a 65% wire reduction. In addition, the close coupling of the twisted pair wires improves the EMC because the equal and opposite LVDS currents in the wires create equal and opposite electromagnetic fields that tend to cancel each other's effects. This reduces the radiated emissions. The reduced vulnerability to electrical noise interference comes from the fact the noise affects both signals commonly. Since the LVDS receiver senses the difference between the two commonly affected signals, it senses no impact from the common mode noise. An FPD link serializer The FPD-Link data transmission scheme serializes seven single-ended data bits per clock cycle into each of the LVDS channels. Therefore, the LVDS bit rate is 7 times the frequency of the clock signal. For example, in the 18-bit RGB application, there are 6 bits each for R, G, and B and an additional 3 bits for horizontal and vertical sync and an enable signal. This means there are 21 total data signals in each clock cycle, which means the 7 to 1 serialization reduces this down to 3 data channels. Then if the clock signal is 50 MHz the LVDS streaming video data rate will be 350 Mbit/s per channel, and the total data transfer rate will be 1,050 Mbit/s over the 3 channels. This same scheme scales to 24-bit and 30-bit color in the following manner. An FPD-Link interface with 4 data channels and 1 clock (4D+C) then reduces the 28-bit input down to 4 pairs plus the clock, which is perfect for 8-bits per RGB plus 4 video control bits. A 5D+C FPD-Link interface serializes 35-bits per clock cycle, which is 10-bits per RGB plus 5 video control bits.  Automotive and more applications  Automotive infotainment displays for navigation systems started using FPD-Link in 2001. BMW was the first car maker to use FPD-Link in their cars for transferring navigation graphics from the head unit to the central information display. Many other car manufacturers then started using FPD-Link. Today, most infotainment and driver assist applications are using FPD-Link II and FPD-Link III to benefit from the embedded clock and control signals, which will be described in the next section. One of the main benefits is the reduced cable size and weight due to the single wire pair for all the data and clock signals. The automotive environment is known to be one of the harshest for electronic equipment due to inherent extreme temperatures and electrical transients. In order to satisfy these stringent reliability requirements, the FPD-Link II and III chipsets meet or exceed the AEC-Q100 automotive reliability standard for integrated circuits, and the ISO 10605 standard for automotive ESD applications. Another display interface based on FPD-Link is OpenLDI. (Sometimes the OpenLDI and FPD-Link terms are used interchangeably.) It enables longer cable lengths because of a built-in DC balance coding to reduce the effects of intersymbol interference. In the OpenLDI version of DC balance coding, one of the seven serialized bits indicates whether the coding scheme needs to invert the other six bits transmitted in the clock period to maintain DC balance. Therefore, each LVDS pair other than the clock pair effectively transmits six bits per clock cycle. However, OpenLDI lost the video-transfer standards competition to Digital Visual Interface (DVI) in the early twenty-first century, and the result was stand-alone LCD panels using DVI to receive video from a desktop computer.  FPD-Link II  FPD-Link II was introduced in 2006 and is an improved version of FPD-Link. National Semiconductor designed it specifically for automotive infotainment and camera interface applications. FPD-Link II embeds the clock in the data signal and therefore uses only one differential pair to transmit both the clock and video data. This further reduces the size, weight, and cost of cables for infotainment and safety camera applications. For example, the 24-bit color application now uses only one twisted pair instead of the 5 twisted pair used by FPD-Link. There are additional benefits from FPD-Link II. For example, the car makers appreciate the increased cable length even with reduced cable cost. This is because of the embedded clock feature that eliminates the timing skew between clock and data signals. This was the limiting factor to cables with separate clock and data pairs because all pairs had to be manufactured at precisely equal length to control the timing skew between the clock and data pairs. This length matching added to the cable cost. Another benefit for FPD- Link II comes from adding DC balance to the signals. Because the signal is DC balanced the application can use AC coupling, which eliminates the ground current problem between data source and destination. This is critical in the automotive applications because of the potential for large transient currents that can damage sensitive electronic equipment. The higher resolution applications required FPD-Link II to increase the data throughput. It started at about 1 Gbit/s data throughput on a single twisted pair which is well within the capability for LVDS technology. But for the applications that required up to 1.8 Gbit/s over a single pair, LVDS was not as reliable as necessary for the automotive applications. By changing from LVDS to current mode logic (CML), the newest FPD-Link II chipsets were able to reliably send high bit-rate video streams over cables longer than 10 m. Typical CML circuit FPD-Link III FPD-Link III was introduced in 2010. Further improving FPD- Link II, FPD-Link III's major feature is embedding a bidirectional communication channel on the same differential pair. This bidirectional channel transfers control signals between source and destination in addition to the clock and streaming video data. Therefore, FPD-Link III even further reduces cable cost by eliminating cables for control channels such as I2C and CAN bus. FPD-Link III's embedded control channel uses the I2C bus protocol between the source and destination in the first implementations. (However, it is not limited to I2C.) The I2C master can read and write to all the slaves on the other side of the FPD-Link III chipset, which is effectively transparent to the I2C master and slaves communications. For example, this enables infotainment head units to control and configure displays, and image processing units to control and configure cameras using the same twisted pair cable as the data transmission. The Digital Content Protection LLC approved FPD-Link III in 2009 as a high-bandwidth interface for carrying content whose owner wants HDCP security. This approval enables the FPD-Link III chipsets to include the highly confidential HDCP keys and state machines to encrypt the content. The embedded control channel in the FPD-Link III chipsets simplifies the key exchange protocols between the source and destinations that verify the destination is secure. An additional new feature, FPD-Link III stops using LVDS technology and uses only CML for the serialized high-speed signals. This enables it to easily work at data rates greater than 3 Gbit/s on cables greater than 10 m long. An additional benefit for using CML is the coax-cable drive capability. The CML technology works well when driving the single conductor in coax cables. Since coax cables are very good at controlling impedance and noise, they reduce the need for differential signaling, which better tolerates impedance discontinuities and noise interference. Another added benefit for FPD-Link III is the adaptive equalization built into the deserializer. The input signal to the deserializer usually has diminished integrity. This typically results from the Intersymbol interference (ISI) due to cable loss. The adaptive equalizer can sense the poor signal and restore it to the original integrity. This feature is useful in every application where the cable can vary in length, operating temperature, and humidity because these variables affect the ISI resulting from the low-pass filter effect of the cable.

Wheeler played for the U.S. Wightman Cup team and was ranked as high as No. 4 in the United States during her career. Wheeler won the singles title at the Pacific Southwest Championships in September 1936 after a win in the final against Alice Marble who had become U.S. National champion earlier that month. At the Tri-State Tennis Tournament in Cincinnati, Wheeler won the singles title in 1934 and was a singles finalist in 1940. At the Canadian National tournament, she won the singles title in 1933. She also paired with Helen Bernard to reach the finals of the 1940 National Clay Court Doubles Championships, then lost to Alice Marble and Mary Arnold, at a final played in Cincinnati. She won the doubles title at the U.S. Women's Indoor Championships in 1940 partnering Norma Taubele Barber. She won the Oregon state singles and doubles titles in 1932 and the singles title in 1933. She was a quarterfinalist at the 1936 U.S. Nationals and won the U.S. Girls 18s doubles title in 1932. In 1929 at the Carlton Winter championships in Cannes, France, Wheeler was seeded No. 1, ahead of French player, future International Tennis Hall of Fame enshrinee Simonne Mathieu. According to the February 9, 1939, edition of the Oakland Tribune, Mathieu protested, telling officials \\"Am I not the greatest player in all of France? If I am not seeded No. 1, I will quit the tournament.\\" Wheeler quickly gave up the No. 1 seed in deference to Mathieu, and took her place as the No. 2 seed. Wheeler participated in the Wimbledon Championships in 1938, 1939 and 1955. She reached the third round in singles and the quarterfinals in doubles, both in 1939. With her hsuband she took part in the mixed doubles event in 1955 and lost in the second round after a bye in the first.

It can be used to visualize the walls of these organs, or to look at adjacent structures. Combined with Doppler imaging, nearby blood vessels can also be evaluated. Endoscopic ultrasonography is most commonly used in the upper digestive tract and in the respiratory system. The procedure is performed by gastroenterologists or pulmonologists who have had extensive training. For the patient, the procedure feels almost identical to the endoscopic procedure without the ultrasound part, unless ultrasound-guided biopsy of deeper structures is performed. Digestive tract =Upper digestive tract= For endoscopic ultrasound of the upper digestive tract, a probe is inserted into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum during a procedure called esophagogastroduodenoscopy. Among other uses, it allows for screening for pancreatic cancer, esophageal cancer, and gastric cancer, as well as benign tumors of the upper gastrointestinal tract. It also allows for characterization and biopsy of any focal lesions found in the upper gastrointestinal tract, such as esophageal tuberculosis. This is done by inserting a needle through the stomach lining into the target. Less commonly this procedure is used to identify malformations and masses in the bile ducts and pancreatic ducts. Endoscopic ultrasound is performed with the patient sedated. The endoscope is passed through the mouth and advanced through the esophagus to the suspicious area. From various positions between the esophagus and duodenum, organs within and outside the gastrointestinal tract can be imaged to see if they are abnormal, and they can be biopsied by a process called fine needle aspiration. Organs such as the liver, pancreas, and adrenal glands are easily biopsied, as are any abnormal lymph nodes. In addition, the gastrointestinal wall itself can be imaged to see if it is abnormally thick, suggesting inflammation or malignancy. The technique is highly sensitive for detection of pancreatic cancer (90‚Äì95% sensitivity), particularly in patients who are suspected to have a mass or present with jaundice. Its role in staging patients with pancreatic cancer is limited to local metastases; however, in combination with CT scan which provides information on regional metastases, it provides an excellent imaging modality for diagnosis and staging of pancreatic carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasound can also be used in conjunction with endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography (ERCP). The ultrasound probe is used to locate gall stones which may have migrated into the common bile duct. This occurrence may cause obstruction of the drain shared by the liver and pancreas, which may lead to lower back pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. =Lower digestive tract= Echo-endoscopy can also be used for imaging of the rectum and colon, although these applications are lesser known. It is used primarily to stage newly diagnosed rectal or anal cancer. EUS-guided fine needle aspiration may be used to sample lymph nodes during this procedure. Evaluation of the integrity of the anal sphincters may also be done during lower EUS procedures. Respiratory tract An endoscopic ultrasound probe placed in the esophagus can also be used to visualize lymph nodes in the chest surrounding the airways (bronchi), which is important for the staging of lung cancer. Ultrasound can also be performed with an endoscopic probe inside the bronchi themselves, a technique known as endobronchial ultrasound. Technical aspects The quality of the image produced is directly proportional to the frequency used. Therefore, a high frequency produces a better image. However, high frequency ultrasound does not penetrate as well as lower frequency ultrasound so that the examination of the nearby organs may be more difficult.

The rich volcanic soils produced a wide array of products, including beans, peppers, corn, cocoa, and cassava (manioc). Agricultural land was held communally, and each community had a central marketplace for trading and distributing food. The arrival of the Spanish in the early 16th century destroyed, for all intents and purposes, the indigenous agricultural system. The early conquistadors were interested primarily in gold; European diseases and forced work in the gold mines decimated the native population. Some small areas continued to be cultivated at the end of the 16th century, but most previously tilled land reverted to jungle. By the early 17th century, cattle raising, along with small areas of corn and cocoa cultivation and forestry, had become the primary function of Nicaragua's land. Beef, hides, and tallow were the colony's principal exports for the next two and a half centuries.  The Coffee Boom, 1840s‚Äî1940s  Coffee was the product that would change Nicaragua's economy. Coffee was first grown domestically as a curiosity in the early 19th century. In the late 1840s, however, as coffee's popularity grew in North America and Europe, commercial coffee growing began in the area around Managua. By the early 1850s, passengers crossing Nicaragua en route to California were served large quantities of Nicaraguan coffee. The Central American coffee boom was in full swing in Nicaragua by the 1870s, and large areas in western Nicaragua were cleared and planted with coffee trees. Unlike traditional cattle raising or subsistence farming, coffee production required significant capital and large pools of labor. Laws were therefore passed to encourage foreign investment and allow easy acquisition of land. The Subsidy Laws of 1879 and 1889 gave planters with large holdings a subsidy of US$0.05 per tree. By the end of the 19th century, the entire economy came to resemble what is often referred to as a \\"banana republic\\" economy ‚Äî one controlled by foreign interests and a small domestic elite oriented toward the production of a single agriculture export. Profits from coffee production flowed abroad or to the small number of landowners. Taxes on coffee were virtually nonexistent. The economy was also hostage to fluctuations in the price of coffee on the world markets ‚Äî wide swings in coffee prices meant boom or bust years in Nicaragua.  Diversification and Growth, 1945‚Äì77  The period after World War II was a time of economic diversification. The government brought in foreign technocrats to give advice on increasing production of new crops; hectarage in bananas and sugarcane increased, livestock herds grew, and cotton became a new export crop. The demand for cotton during the Korean War (1950‚Äì53) caused a rapid increase in cotton production, and by the mid-1950s, cotton was the nation's second largest export earner, after coffee. Economic growth continued in the 1960s, largely as a result of industrialization. Under the stimulus of the newly formed Central American Common Market, Nicaragua achieved a certain degree of specialization in processed foods, chemicals, and metal manufacturing. By the end of the 1960s, however, import substitution industrialization as a stimulus for economic growth had been exhausted. The 1969 Football War between Honduras and El Salvador, two members of the CACM, effectively suspended attempts at regional integration until 1987, when the Esquipulas II agreement was signed. By 1970 the industrial sector was undergoing little additional import substitution, and the collapse of the CACM meant that Nicaragua's economic growth, which had come from the expanding manufacturing sector, halted. Furthermore, the manufacturing firms that had developed under the tariff protection of the CACM were generally high-cost and inefficient; consequently, they were at a disadvantage when exporting outside the region. Although statistics for the period 1970‚Äì77 seemed to show continued economic growth, they reflected fluctuations in demand rather than a continued diversification of the economy. The gross domestic product rose 13% in 1974, the biggest boom in Nicaragua's economic history. However, these figures largely represented the jump in construction as the country struggled to rebuild after the disastrous 1972 earthquake. Likewise, the positive growth in 1976‚Äì77 was merely a reflection of the high world prices for coffee and cotton. Positive GDP growth rates in the 1970s masked growing structural problems in the economy. The 1972 earthquake destroyed much of Nicaragua's industrial infrastructure, which had been located in Managua. An estimated 10,000 people were killed and 30,000 injured, most of them in the capital area. The earthquake destroyed most government offices, the financial district of Managua, and about 2,500 small shops engaged in manufacturing and commercial activities. About 90% of city housing in Managua was left unstable. Government budget deficits and inflation were the legacies of the earthquake. The government increased expenses to finance rebuilding, which primarily benefited the construction industry, in which the Somoza family had strong financial interests. Because earthquake reconstruction generated few new revenues, except through borrowing, most of the resulting public deficits were covered by foreign loans. In the late 1970s, Nicaragua had the highest level of foreign indebtedness in Central America. Most of the benefits of the three decades of growth after World War II were concentrated in a few hands. Several groups of influential firms and families, most notably the Somoza family, controlled most of the nation's production. The Banam√©rica Group, an offshoot of the conservative elite of Granada, had powerful interests in sugar, rum, cattle, coffee, and retailing. The Banic Group, so-called because of its ties to the Nicaraguan Bank of Industry and Commerce (Banco Nicarag√ºense de Industria y Comercio-Banic), had its roots in the liberal families of Le√≥n and had ties to the cotton, coffee, beer, lumber, construction, and fishing industries. The third interest controlling the nation's production was the Somoza family, which had wide holdings in almost every segment of Nicaraguan society. Financial dealings for the Somozas were handled by the Central Bank of Nicaragua (Banco Central de Nicaragua), which the Somozas treated as if it were a commercial bank. The Central Bank made frequent personal loans to the Somozas, which often went unpaid. Although the other financial groups used financial means primarily to further their interests, the Somozas protected their financial interests by controlling the government and its institutions. The Somoza family owned an estimated 10% to 20% of the country's arable land, was heavily involved in the food processing industry, and controlled import- export licenses. The Somozas also controlled the transportation industry by owning outright, or at least having controlling interest in, the country's main seaports, the national airline, and Nicaragua's maritime fleet. Much of the profit from these enterprises was then reinvested in real estate holdings throughout the United States and Latin America. Some analysts estimated that by the mid-1970s, the Somozas owned or controlled 60% of the nation's economic activity. When Anastasio Somoza Debayle (president, 1967‚Äì72, 1974‚Äì79) fled Nicaragua in 1979, the family's worth was estimated to be between US$500 million and US$1.5 billion. Sandinista Revolution, 1977‚Äì79 By the mid-1970s, the government's economic and dictatorial political policies had alienated nearly all sectors of society. Armed opposition to the Somoza regimes, which had started as a small rural insurrection in the early 1960s, had grown by 1977 to a full-scale civil war. The fighting caused foreign investment to drop sharply and the private sector to cut investment plans. Many government expenditures were shifted to the military budget. As fighting in the cities increased, destruction and looting caused a large loss in inventories and operating stock. Foreign investment, which before 1977 had been a significant factor in the economy's growth, almost stopped. As the fighting intensified further, most liquid assets flowed out of the country. Although the anti-Somoza forces finally won their struggle in July 1979, the human and physical cost of the revolution was tremendous. As many as 50,000 people lost their lives in the fighting, 100,000 were wounded, and 40,000 children were left orphans. About US$500 million in physical plants, equipment, and materials was destroyed; housing, hospitals, transportation, and communications incurred damage of US$80 million. The GDP shrank an estimated 25% in 1979 alone.  Sandinista Era, 1979‚Äì90  The new government, formed in 1979 and dominated by the Sandinistas, resulted in a new model of economic development. The new leadership was conscious of the social inequities produced during the previous thirty years of unrestricted economic growth and was determined to make the country's workers and peasants, the \\"economically underprivileged,\\" the prime beneficiaries of the new society. Consequently, in 1980 and 1981, unbridled incentives to private investment gave way to institutions designed to redistribute wealth and income. Private property would continue to be allowed, but all land belonging to the Somozas was confiscated. The ideology of the Sandinistas put the future of the private sector and of private ownership of the means of production in doubt. Even though under the new government both public and private ownership were accepted, government spokespersons occasionally referred to a reconstruction phase in the country's development, in which property owners and the professional class would be tapped for their managerial and technical expertise. After reconstruction and recovery, the private sector would give way to expanded public ownership in most areas of the economy. Despite such ideas, which represented the point of view of a faction of the government, the Sandinista government remained officially committed to a mixed economy. Economic growth was uneven in the 1980s. Restructuring of the economy and the rebuilding immediately following the end of the civil war caused the GDP to jump about 5% in 1980 and 1981. Each year from 1984 to 1990, however, showed a drop in the GDP. After 1985 the government chose to fill the gap between decreasing revenues and mushrooming military expenditures by printing large amounts of paper money. Inflation skyrocketed, peaking in 1987 at more than 13,109,5% annually. Measures taken by the government to lower inflation were largely wiped out by natural disaster. In early 1988, the administration of Daniel Ortega (Sandinista junta coordinator 1979‚Äì85, president 1985‚Äì90) established an austerity program to lower inflation. Price controls were tightened, and a new currency was introduced. As a result, by August 1988, inflation had dropped to an annual rate of 240%. The following month, however, Hurricane Joan cut a devastating path directly across the center of the country. Damage was extensive, and the government's program of massive spending to repair the infrastructure destroyed its anti-inflation measures. In its eleven years in power, the Sandinista government never overcame most of the economic inequalities that it inherited from the Somoza era (inherited by the U.S., though for most of the eleven years they were at war with American- trained counterinsurgents). Years of war, policy missteps due to inexperience, natural disasters, and the effects of the United States trade embargo all hindered economic development. The early economic gains of the Sandinistas were wiped out by seven years of sometimes precipitous economic decline, and in 1990, by most standards, Nicaragua and most Nicaraguans were considerably poorer than they were in the 1970s. The Chamorro Era, 1990‚Äì1996 The economic policies of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro (president, 1990‚Äì1997) were a radical change from those of the previous administration. The president proposed to revitalize the economy by reactivating the private sector and stimulating the export of agricultural products. However, the administration's political base was shaky. The president's political coalition, the National Opposition Union (Uni√≥n Nacional Oppositora-UNO), was a group of fourteen parties ranging from the far right to the far left. Furthermore, 43% of the voting electorate had voted for the Sandinistas, reflecting support for the overall goals of the former administration although not necessarily the results. The Chamorro government's initial economic package embraced a standard International Monetary Fund and World Bank set of policy prescriptions. The IMF demands included instituting measures aimed at halting spiraling inflation; lowering the fiscal deficit by downsizing the publicsector work force and the military, and reducing spending for social programs; stabilizing the national currency; attracting foreign investment; and encouraging exports. This course was an economic path mostly untraveled by Nicaragua, still heavily dependent on traditional agro-industrial exports, exploitation of natural resources, and continued foreign assistance. Inspired by the IMF, Minister of Finance Francisco Mayoraga quickly put together an economic \\"Plan of 100 Days.\\" This plan, also called the \\"Mayoraga Plan,\\" cut the deficit and helped to lower inflation. Loss of jobs and higher prices under the plan, however, also resulted in crippling public and private-sector strikes throughout the country. Mayoraga's tenure in office barely exceeded the 100 days of his economic plan. By the end of 1990, the government was forced to abandon most of its freemarket reforms. A series of political problems and natural disasters continued to plague the economy in 1991 and 1992. The need to accommodate left and right-wing views within its ruling coalition and attempts to work with the Sandinista opposition effectively prevented the implementation of unpopular economic measures. The government was unable to lower government expenditures or to hold the value of the newly introduced gold c√≥rdoba stable against the United States dollar. A severe drought in 1992 decimated the principal export crops. In September 1992, a destructive tsunami struck western Nicaragua, leaving thousands homeless. Furthermore, foreign aid and investment, on which the Nicaraguan economy had depended heavily for growth in the years preceding the Sandinista administration, never returned in significant amounts.

A career military officer in the United States Army and a Union general during the American Civil War, he served in North and South Carolina during the war. A postbellum expert in underwater demolition, he wrote a treatise on the subject in 1869. He continued with the Army after the war, using his expertise as assistant to the Chief Engineer in Washington, DC and at a post on Lake Erie. From 1862 to December 1863 Foster commanded the Department of North Carolina. After the Emancipation Proclamation, he appointed Horace James, a Congregational minister, to help freedmen prepare for independent life, and directed a former contraband camp to be developed as the Freedmen's Colony of Roanoke Island. By 1864, 2,200 freedmen were settled on household plots. Many worked for pay for the Army, which held the forts. Under President Andrew Johnson, after the war, the Army abandoned the colony. Most of the freedmen chose to return to the mainland for work. Early life Foster was born in Whitefield, New Hampshire. When he was ten, his family moved to Nashua, where he attended the local schools before enrolling in the Hancock Academy. He graduated from West Point in 1846, fourth in his class of 59 cadets. He first served as an engineer during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, under Winfield Scott. Severely wounded at the Battle of Molino del Rey, he won two brevet promotions for bravery. After the war, Foster returned to West Point as an instructor. In 1858 he was on engineering duty in Charleston Harbor, where he helped in the construction of Fort Sumter. Civil War Promoted to captain of U.S. engineers, Foster was in command of the garrison at Fort Moultrie when the Civil War began. He immediately transferred his small force to Fort Sumter and became second-in-command to Maj. Robert Anderson during the Battle of Fort Sumter. Foster was appointed a brigadier general of volunteers on October 23, 1861, and commanded the 1st Brigade in Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside's North Carolina Expedition. He was conspicuous in action at the battles of Roanoke Island and New Bern. After the Battle of Roanoke Island, the Union renamed the Confederate Fort Bartow as Fort Foster in his honor. The US Army dismantled the three forts on the island in late 1865 after the end of the war. After General Burnside was transferred to Virginia, Foster assumed command of the Department of North Carolina. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 18, 1862, and led the Goldsboro Expedition. During Confederate Lieutenant General James Longstreet's Tidewater Campaign, upon hearing of a planned Confederate attack on Washington, North Carolina, Foster personally assumed command of its defenses. When D. H. Hill demanded the surrender of Washington, Foster defiantly replied, \\"If you want Washington, come and get it.\\" Hill's forces besieged the garrison and two Union relief expeditions were turned back. Foster escaped the besieged city in order to personally lead a relief column back. Hill withdrew his forces shortly afterward. Both Confederate and Union forces burned down much of the town. In December, Foster led the Goldsboro campaign won two minor battle at Kinston and Goldsboro against inferior confederate forces led by brigadier general Nathan G. Evans, resulting in the shutdown of the vital Confederate supply line of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad for merely two weeks. After President Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation freeing all slaves in rebel territory, in April 1863 Foster appointed Horace James, an experienced Congregational chaplain, as \\"Superintendent of Negro Affairs for the North Carolina District.\\" To support the transition to freedom for former slaves, he was to develop a colony from the contraband camp that had developed on Roanoke Island. It became known as the Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony (1863‚Äì1867). James also managed other camps for freedmen in the state, such as one at Trent River near his base at New Bern. Foster directed James to settle the people, give them farming tools and prepare them for a \\"free and independent community.\\" By 1864, 2,200 freedmen lived on Roanoke Island, settled on individual household plots, and working for pay for the Army. James recruited teachers and founded several schools. A sawmill was built and a fisheries started. More than 150 freedmen from the island joined the nearly 4,000 from North Carolina who joined the United States Colored Troops. After the war, the Army dismantled the forts. Due to President Andrew Johnson's returning lands to Confederate landowners, the colony was abandoned. Most of the freedmen chose to be transported to the mainland, where they looked for work. By 1870, only 300 remained on the island.\\"The Roanoke Island Freedmen's Colony\\" , provided by National Park Service, at North Carolina Digital History: LEARN NC, accessed 11 November 2010 In December 1863, Foster was sent to Tennessee to assume command of the Department of the Ohio and its corresponding Army of the Ohio. He was in command for only a short time before he was badly injured in a fall from his horse. Upon his recovery, he took command of the Department of the South and aided in forcing the surrender of Savannah, Georgia. He was making preparations for the surrender of Charleston, but his wounds forced him to relinquish command to Maj. Gen. Quincy A. Gilmore. Foster was assigned to command of the Department of Florida at the end of the war, receiving a promotion to the rank of major general in the volunteer service and brevet major general in the regular army. Postbellum After the war, Foster remained in the army, being promoted to lieutenant colonel of engineers in 1867. Promoted to colonel of engineers in 1871, he was involved in military and underwater surveying. He became an expert in underwater demolition, publishing a definitive manual on the subject in 1869 that became the acknowledged reference work. From 1871 until 1874, he was assistant to the Chief of Engineers in Washington, D.C. His final post was as superintendent of the Harbor of Refuge on Lake Erie. Foster died in Nashua, New Hampshire, and was buried in Nashua Cemetery. The first official reunion of the New Hampshire Veterans Association, which took place in Manchester, New Hampshire in October 1875, was named Camp J.G. Foster. Honors * The John G.

Released October 15, 1997, Panzer General II is the sixth SSI game in the \\"General\\" series and the first in the \\"Living Battlefield \\" series. It takes place during World War II, covering events from the Spanish Civil War in 1938 to hypothetical battles in 1946. In the April 2000 issue of the magazine PC Gamer, it was voted the 44th best computer game of all time. (The highest rating in the General series.) The game was re-released in 2010 on GOG.com.  Gameplay  The game of Panzer General II is divided into scenarios, each representing a specific battle. All are played on a hex map, which is divided up into hexagons that represent between one and two kilometers. At the beginning of the game, the entire map is revealed to the player, but enemy units are covered by fog of war and are not visible. Each hex is assigned one of thirteen terrain types that penalize or assist the movement of units. Mountain, city, and forest types block line of sight. The game also features four kinds of capturable hexes marked by a flag indicating the country owning it: ownership, designating a player's ownership of a city, town or other important feature; supply, allowing unit deployment; victory, indicating critical cities or objectives; and victory-supply, combining victory and supply. The objective is to defeat an enemy by capturing all of their victory hexes in a specified number of turns. The player attacks enemies and captures hexes by moving units, which approximately represent a battalion, regiment or squadron. There are eight types of units, each with different properties: Infantry, Tank, Anti-Tank, Recon, Air Defense, Fighter, Artillery, and Bomber. Each unit is assigned a numerical value to represent its movement (in hexes); its line of sight (in hexes); its attack abilities against armored targets, unarmored targets, ships, and airplanes; its defense against ranged, close, and air attacks; as well as values for initiative and remaining ammunition and fuel. The final value, health, is represented by a number, usually 1 to 10. When attacking or defending, the unit receives experience points based on the amount of damage inflicted to its enemy (also some points are received when damage is caused by the enemy). Each 100 experience points correspond to one experience level (a value ranging from 0 to 5). When attaining a higher level, the unit may also receive a famous leader, granting it some special abilities. The in-game currency used to measure unit buy and upgrade costs is called \\"prestige.\\" It is gained by capturing scenario objectives or as a reward for a quick and decisive victory. The standard game contains many real-life scenarios; however, similarly to other games of the series, players will be able to play some hypothetical scenarios if they perform exceptionally in their command career. For example, Germany can invade and capture the British Isles by capturing Windsor or they can invade Malta with Italy. Again, if the player attains victories in the east and defeats the Soviet Union, Germany can invade the United States from the Port of Savannah and then march to Oak Ridge, Tennessee to capture a prototype of a US atomic bomb. Strategy The player's pieces are carried between scenarios: optimizing what is effective in one scenario (say aircraft) may lead to problems in a subsequent scenario where what is effective differs. Optimal strategies, especially between the scenarios in a campaign, can be complex. Changing game characteristics At the beginning of a scenario or a campaign, the player can select the number of points gained for capturing supply points. (This, in turn, affects how many units and how strong the player units are.) The manual states that the intention is to make for a more or less challenging game, but the actual effect is rather different since to some degree the computer player adjusts strategy to compensate for the human player's strengths. The player is also allowed to choose which side to play in individual scenarios (but not in campaigns). Patches and modifications There are only two official game patches released for Panzer General II, 1.01 and 1.02; they are available only for UK, US, German and French language versions (no patch was ever released for the Japanese version). Because the game in version 1.02 had many bugs left and severely limited the freedom of designing custom game data (scenarios, campaigns, maps and units), a number of unofficial patches were made. A fan- made 2.20 patch is available, and the GOG.com release of the game offers both v1.02 and v2.20 out of the box. Any further updates are unlikely, due to lack of activity from the unofficial patch maintainer and because of closed- sourceness of PGII.http://panzercentral.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=43208&sid;=28c0775830a0c086071e0b3a19da785b Reception Panzer General IIs initial shipment of 100,000 copies sold out within roughly one week of the game's release.

The policy was an attempt to involve the clan chiefs within the English polity, and to guarantee their property under English common law, as distinct from the traditional Irish Brehon law system. This strategy essentially sought to assimilate the Gaelic leadership into the new Tudor Kingdom of Ireland and Anglican Church, contrary to more radical opinions which sought outright extermination. Policy Surrender and regrant was led by King Henry VIII (ruled 1509‚Äì47) in a bid to extend and secure his control over the island of Ireland. This policy started in the years between the Geraldine rebellion (1534‚Äì39) and his subsequent creation of the Kingdom of Ireland in 1541‚Äì42. Henry's problem was that many of the Irish clans remained autonomous and outside the control of his administration in Dublin. Gaelic chiefs and some autonomous Norman-Irish lords were actively encouraged to surrender their lands to the king, and then have them regranted (returned) as freeholds paying a chief rent under a royal charter if they swore loyalty to him. Those who surrendered were also expected to speak English, wear English-style dress, remain loyal to the Crown, follow English laws and customs, abjure the Roman Catholic Church, and convert to Henry's new Anglican Church. In return they would be protected from attack and could organise local courts and enter the Parliament of Ireland. The initiative of \\"surrender and regrant\\" was launched in the 1540s under the new English Governor of Ireland, Anthony St. Leger. Essentially St. Leger's idea was to transform and assimilate the more autonomous leaders of Gaelic Ireland into something akin to the political and constitutional system of England, where everyone was theoretically equal at law under the monarch. =First steps= It had begun successfully in the late 1530s, according to the Rev. James MacCaffrey, writing in 1914: :\\"Three years later (1537) MacGillapatrick (Fitzpatrick) of Ossory promised faithfully to abolish the usurped jurisdiction of the Pope, to have the English language spoken in his territories, and to send his son to be brought up with a knowledge of the English language and customs. In return for this he received a royal grant of his land and possessions, was created Baron of Colthill and Castleton, and was promised a seat in the House of Lords, a favour which he obtained in 1543, when he was appointed a peer with the title of Baron of Upper Ossory. Brian O'Conor Faly of Offaly and his rival Cahir, Baron of Ballyane made their submission in March 1538. They renounced the jurisdiction of the Pope, agreed to hold their lands from the king, and to abandon all claims to tribute or black rent from their neighbours of the Pale. Brian O'Connor was created Baron of Offaly. He was followed in his submission by the Earl of Desmond (1541), MacWilliam Burke, O'Brien of Thomond, Manus O'Donnell (August 1541) and finally by Con O'Neill (1542). All these, together with a host of minor chieftains and dependents, renounced the authority of the Pope, accepted re-grants of their lands from the king, begged for English titles, and did not think it beneath their dignity to accept gifts of money and robes. Con O'Neill became Earl of Tyrone, his son Matthew Baron of Dungannon, O'Brien Earl of Thomond, his nephew Donogh Baron of Ibricken, MacWilliam Burke Earl of Clanrickard, while knighthoods were distributed freely among the lesser nobles.\\" =Clan chiefs who took part= In the late 1530s and early 1540s, a number of leading Gaelic families saw the political value of accepting this new Tudor policy. In 1541, Br√≠an √ìg Mac Giolla Ph√°draig became the first Irish lord to take his seat in the Dublin Parliament as Baron Upper Ossory. Other clans who partook in the process included the O'Neills of Tir Eoghain who were created the earls of Tyrone and as such sat in the Irish House of Lords from 1542. Many of the regranted clan chiefs remained Roman Catholic after the death of Queen Mary in 1558, which, after the final split between England and Rome in 1570, meant that their new legal status was still rather tangential in the eyes of conformist officials. In 1543 the O'Briens of Thomond were created lords Inchiquin. His neighbour Donogh O'Grady was knighted and had his lands regranted in the same year. The Mac Aonghusa / Magennis clan in county Down became knights, and the O'Byrnes of Wicklow, the Kavanaghs of Wicklow, Cahir, Baron of Ballyane Lords of Ballyane, the O'Donnells of Donegal were others who accepted the system. The O'Donnell chief was created an earl briefly by James I of England in 1603‚Äì07. The Clanricarde Burke took the title of earl in 1543. The O'Shaughnessys of Gort and the O'Driscolls of Corcu Lo√≠gde also became knights. Ruair√≠ Caoch √ì M√≥rdha (Rory O'More; the father of Rory O'More) of Laois surrendered and was regranted in 1542‚Äì43 but died in 1545. His clan was out of favour by 1550; in 1556 Laois was shired as the \\"Queen's County\\".Indenture dated 13 May, 34 Henry VIII (1543): terms of the O'More surrender and regrant, citing the Carew Manuscripts 1515‚Äì74 Other clans such as the MacMahons of County Monaghan did not take part in the new system. Tibbot ne Long Bourke, the heir of \\"Lower MacWilliam Burke\\" lands in County Mayo, and a son of Gr√°inne O'Malley, remained outside the system until 1593; he was knighted in 1604 and was created the first Viscount Mayo in 1627.Chambers, A. \\"Shadow Lord: Theobald Bourke, Tibbott-Ne-Long, 1567‚Äì1629: Son of the pirate queen Grace O'Malley\\" (Ashfield Press, Dublin 2007) p. 109; Gr√°inne herself accepted the system in 1576, in respect of her own lands, though she managed her lands with a high degree of autonomy over the next two decades.Chambers, Anne: Ireland's Pirate Queen: The True Story of Grace O'Malley, p 138. New York: MJF, 2003. Donnel O'Donovan, chief of the largest sept of the O'Donovans of County Cork offered a surrender of their sept lands in 1592 (with similar offers by Conoghor O‚ÄôKallaghane, Conoghor O‚ÄôMahoney and Teig M‚ÄôOwen Carty), to personally receive back the sept lands by patent. The surrender to Queen Elizabeth was not effected until 1608, to James I; Donnel O'Donovan received the sept lands as his personal estate in 1615, but did not receive an English title.CALENDAR OP THE STATE PAPERS, RELATING TO I R E L A N D, OF THE REIGNS OF ELIZABETH, 1592, October 1596, June.

The overlord in the Barony of Carbery to Donovan of Clan Cathail, the MacCarthy Reagh, who surrendered his sept lands in 1606, also never received any titles under this system. Donal McCarthy M√≥r was knighted in 1558 and created Earl of Clancare in 1565, but resigned his titles in 1597. The prominent MacCarthys of Muskerry, a separate dynasty, were later created the Viscounts Muskerry in 1628 and Earls of Clancarty in 1658. The chief of the Maguire clan of Fermanagh was created Baron Maguire in 1628.Debrett's Peerage, 22nd edition, 1839, p.768 In 1631 Sir Terence Dempsey was created Viscount Clanmalier. Randal MacDonnell was knighted in 1602, was granted estates in 1603 and was created Earl of Antrim in 1620. Effect on Irish heraldry Because of the number of new lords in the Irish House of Lords and the demise of the former Ireland King of Arms, the office of the Ulster King of Arms was founded in 1552, based at Dublin Castle. Consequently, a large number of ancient Irish family trees were recorded and stored at the castle and later held at Trinity College, Dublin. Almost all of the Irish surname coats of arms were granted in or after 1552, and are supervised now by the Chief Herald of Ireland. Conflict with Gaelic law The Gaelic derbfine elective kingship method in Gaelic law clashed with surrender and regrant, as male relations as distantly related as great-grandsons of a former chief or king were eligible to vote and to be elected to succeed as chief. Often, that meant that several dozen men were eligible to be elected clan chief. This inevitably led to problems since under the new policy, it was possible for those individuals to become tenants of their chiefly cousin who had adopted surrender and regrant. Often the latter had an elected t√°naiste, or deputy chief, who was pushed aside as the next chief by the son of the chief under the system of primogeniture. That caused internal feuding, which was often exploited by English officials based in Dublin, seeking to limit a clan's power or to take some or all of its lands. That was a major cause of the ultimate failure in many cases of the policy of surrender and regrant. The tensions within clans and the new religious division between Catholics and Protestants from 1570, intrusions by grasping royal officials and the lack of royal protection from continuing raids by other clans that had not accepted the new system all made the policy frequently unworkable. Given the wars of 1595‚Äì1603, 1641‚Äì53 and 1689‚Äì91, few of the surviving clans emerged with their lands intact by 1700. In other cases, such as the Inchiquin dynasty, it clearly worked. It was an inclusive and imaginative attempt to stabilise the new Kingdom of Ireland.

The request for proposal issued by the Soviet government in 1954, called for a cruise missile capable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States. Analogous developments in the United States were the SM-62 Snark and SM-64 Navaho cruise missiles, particularly the latter, which used parallel technology and had similar performance goals. Development thumb The first steps towards development of Burya was the idea of Mstislav Vsevolodovich Keldysh of Keldysh bomber. The Burya was planned as a Mach 3 intercontinental nuclear ramjet cruise missile. The Burya was remarkably advanced for its time, and despite setbacks and several crashes, the vehicle demonstrated a range in excess of 6,000 km with a thermonuclear (hydrogen) bomb-sized payload at speeds greater than Mach 3. The Burya had a two-stage design - the daring concept for an intercontinental missile was the second stage, which was powered by a ramjet engine at its operational speed of Mach 3. This varied from the original Trommsdorff concept of World War II in that no mother aircraft launch preceded the rocket boosted phase. The first stage was a ballistic-rocket-derived booster, which accelerated the Burya to altitude and the speed necessary to ignite its ramjet engine: a ramjet does not operate below subsonic speeds, and to use a hybrid jet-ramjet to broaden its operating speed would have been more complex. Successful tests were achieved after official cancellation of the project, when it continued as a technology demonstration. It was a casualty, like the USAF Navaho, of the greater simplicity and relative invulnerability to interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles. The Burya was an early precursor to the Zvezda and Buran projects.\\"Burya\\" The guidance system was realized using an inertial system and also with a star tracking: trought the windows located on the top of the stage 2, the system locate its position relative to the brightest stars.

Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves can cause leakage of blood or stenosis. Dysplasia of the mitral and tricuspid valves - also known as the atrioventricular (AV) valves - can appear as thickened, shortened, or notched valves. The chordae tendinae can be fused or thickened. The papillary muscles can be enlarged or atrophied. The cause is unknown, but genetics play a large role. Dogs and cats with tricuspid valve dysplasia often also have an open foramen ovale, an atrial septal defect, or inflammation of the right atrial epicardium. In dogs, tricuspid valve dysplasia can be similar to Ebstein's anomaly in humans. Mitral valve stenosis is one of the most common congenital heart defects in cats. In dogs, it is most commonly found in Great Danes, German Shepherd Dogs, Bull Terriers, Golden Retrievers, Newfoundlands, and Mastiffs. Tricuspid valve dysplasia is most common in the Old English Sheepdog, German Shepherd Dog, Weimaraner, Labrador Retriever, Great Pyrenees, and sometimes the Papillon. It is inherited in the Labrador Retriever. The disease and symptoms are similar to progression of acquired valve disease in older dogs. Valve leakage leads to heart enlargement, arrhythmias, and congestive heart failure. Heart valve dysplasia can be tolerated for years or progress to heart failure in the first year of life. Diagnosis is with an echocardiogram. The prognosis is poor with significant heart enlargement.

Participating teams of engineering students come from universities across Canada and the United States. They design and build model bridges out of popsicle sticks, toothpicks, white glue and dental floss. History The competition began in the 1960s when Dr. Michael S. Troitsky, a professor in the Civil Engineering Department of Sir George Williams University spoke with students in his bridge design class about building bridge models similar to those in their course work. Students then began building small-scale bridge models using wood and glue. By 1984, the department had become the Department of Building, Civil and Environmental Engineering (BCEE) of Concordia University and held the First Annual Bridge Building Competition. Initially, the contest was only open to Civil Engineering students enrolled at Concordia. Later the event expanded to include other universities in the province of Quebec, then those across Canada. In 1991, the competition included its first international teams, from the United States. In 1988, the Civil Engineering graduating class created an award for most innovative concept, and dedicated it to the memory of Lars Rowland, an alumnus who completed his B.Eng in 1988 at Concordia and was working as a civil engineer for Canadair when he died in 1990 piloting his plane. The inscription reads: :\\"May his creativity, compassion, and love of life serve to inspire you, as it has us, in the pursuit of your dreams.\\" The Crusher, the hydraulic press which tests the strength of each bridge and is the focal point of the competition, has a history of its own. The original Crusher was a hydraulic device which, after ten years of service, was damaged beyond repair in 1994 - exploding hydraulic fluid all over the judges and competitors while attempting to crush the truss- bridge designed by Hugues Rivard, who was a Masters student at BCEE. A mark remains on the ceiling of the Hall Building Alumni Auditorium from the incident, and the real capacity of Rivard's bridge remains a mystery. The next Crusher was a donation from Wainbee in 1994. It was a screw jack style mechanism controlled by a computer. It could apply loads of up to 6000 pounds. In 2000, Mechtronix Inc. donated a new Crusher, which has a 10-ton capacity. During the 2000 competition, a bridge resisted up to 1860 kgf. The winner, however, is the one that has the highest overall score in terms of capacity, esthetic value, and originality. For the 2010 competition a brand new crusher donated by Concordia's department of Building, Civil, and Environmental Engineering and is follows its origins and is again a hydraulic jack.

The name is derived from the Japanese words oru (Êäò„Çã, bend and break) and ha (ÂàÉ, blade). The company is known for inventing the snap-off blade and the rotary cutter. Snap-off blade Founder Yoshio Okada and his younger brother Saburo worked for printing companies where they cut paper with razor blades, but the blades quickly became unusable as their edges wore out. The brothers invented blades with scored lines which could be snapped to reveal sharp unused sections of blade. This idea came to them when they recalled how a chocolate bar given to them by an American soldier in childhood had also broken off in sections. These snap-off blades and their associated handles are now made by many manufacturers in two standard sizes (9 and 18mm). Other products Their products include heavy- duty and specialty cutting tools for the building industry, safety tools for industrial applications, rotary cutters, self-healing mats, art knives and rulers for the crafting industry.

Saunders, flying boat manufacturers based at Cowes, Isle of Wight, southern England; the company was renamed Saunders-Roe. The A17 Cutty Sark was the new company's first design. It was a shoulder-winged twin-engined four-seat amphibian monoplane with an all-metal hull and plywood covered wings. The above-wing pylon-mounted engines could easily be changed, and a variety of different engines were used to power Cutty Sarks, including 104 hp Cirrus Hermes Mk 1s and 120 hp de Havilland Gipsy IIs. The Saro A19 Cloud was developed from this design. Only 12 Cutty Sarks were built, and none lasted long in service, but the type nevertheless saw service with many users in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, China, Japan and the Dominican Republic. Production aircraft * A17/1 : The prototype G-AAIP was first flown 4 July 1929. Bought by Captain Campbell Shaw and Flight Lieutenant Tommy Rose for Isle of Man Air Services. Returned to Cowes in 1933 after being damaged by floating timber. * A17/2 : VH-UNV was exported to Australia by Matthews Aviation flying the Bass Strait between Melbourne and Tasmania from May 1930. On 8 November 1931 the aircraft was driven by wind into a pier at St. Kilda, and Mr E. Lloyd, a passenger who attempted to assist, was killed by a propeller. In 1935 it was sold to Pioneer Air Services. In 1937 it was sold to Keith Caldwell, a young barnstorming pilot from Lindfield NSW (not to be confused with the NZ WWII fighter ace of the same name);Recorded conversation with Keith Caldwell 8/92 on 15 October 1937, at the same time as he joined Qantas as a pilot, Caldwell sold VH-UNV for ¬£700 to the airline as a trainer. It was written off after landing on water with the undercarriage extended on 5 April 1938. * A17/3 : a.k.a. \\"L3\\". Sold to the RNZAF. It was first flown on 3 March 1930, then shipped to New Zealand aboard the where it was reassembled by 28 May 1930. It operated from Hobsonville, Auckland for the next six years. After 221 hours and 5 minutes flying time it was judged worn out beyond economic repair. L3 made its last flight on 23 November 1936, after which it served as an instructional airframe. It was scrapped in 1939. * A17/4 : G-AAVX before being sold to Canada as VR-SAA in 1930. * A17/5 : G-ABBC named \\"Progress I\\" operated out of Blackpool to the Isle of Man by British Amphibious Airlines. Attempts to replace it with an A.19 Cloud after 1933 were blocked due to SARO's decision to operate an airline from the Isle of Man. * A17/6 : Acquired by the Royal Air Force as S1575. * A17/7 : Sold to Canada as VR-HAY * A17/8 : Served in the Kwangsi Air Force in China, but was returned to Britain as G-AETI. * A17/9 : Initially registered G-ABVF then exported to Japan. * A17/10 : Registered G-ACDP to Air Service Training Ltd., used by No 3 E & RFTS until 1942. * A17/11 : Registered G-ACDR to Air Service Training Ltd., used by No 3 E & RFTS until 1942. * A17/12 : Registered G-ADAF.

According to the 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, Gordyene is the ancient name of the region of Bohtan (now ≈ûƒ±rnak Province). It is mentioned as Beth Qardu in Syriac sources and is described as a small vassal state between Armenia and Persia in the mountainous area south of Lake Van in modern TurkeyParthian City Index Corduene must also be sought on the left bank of the Tigris. It has been cited as the country of the Carduchians, a fertile mountainous district, rich in pasturage. The Kingdom of Gordyene emerged from the declining Seleucid Empire and for most of its history, it was a province of the Roman EmpireTheodor Mommsen History of Rome - The Establishment of the Military Monarchy Page 24 and acknowledged the sovereignty of Rome.The History of the Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire - Vol 2 - Chapter XXIV Part IV From 189 to 90 BC, it enjoyed a period of independence. The people of Gordyene were known to have worshiped the Hurrian sky God Teshub.Olaf A. Toffteen, Notes on Assyrian and Babylonian Geography, The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, pp.323-357, 1907, p.341 Origins According to Arshak Safrastian, the Medes and Scythians mentioned in classical Greek literature existed only as preconceived notions. Equating the Carduchi with the Gutians, he adds that the moment the Ten Thousand began to skirt the lower slopes of the Hamrin Mountains, they were in contact with the tribes of Gutium which are presented here as Medes or Scythians.A. Safrastian, Kurds and Kurdistan, The Harvill Press, 1948, p. 29 A direct Gutian connection, however, is unlikely, as the Gutians were not Indo-Iranians and only known to have lived in southern Mesopotamia.Patton, Laurie L., et al. (2004) The Indo-Aryan Controversy Carduchoi in Xenophon A people called the Carduchoi are mentioned in Xenophon's Anabasis. They inhabited the mountains north of the Tigris in 401 BC, living in well-provisioned villages. They were enemies to the king of Persia,Anabasis by Xenophon, Book III, chapter V as were the Greek mercenaries with Xenophon, but their response to thousands of armed and desperate strangers was hostile. They had no heavy troops who could face the battle-hardened hoplites, but they used longbows and slings effectively, and for the Greeks the \\"seven days spent in traversing the country of the Carduchians had been one long continuous battle, which had cost them more suffering than the whole of their troubles at the hands of the king [of Persia] and Tissaphernes put together.\\"Anabasis by Xenophon, Book IV, chapter III They have been also mentioned as Gordi by Hecataeus of Miletus c. 520 BC. Korduk' in Armenian sources The region of Corduene was called Korduk' in Armenian sources. In these records, unlike in the Greek ones, the people of Korduk' were loyal to Armenian rule and the rulers of Korduk' are presented as members of the Armenian nobility. A prince of Korduk' served in the counsel of the Armenian king Trdat and helped to defend Armenia's southern borders. Additionally, it seems that there was the early presence of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Korduk'.Marciak, Mark, Sophene, Gordyene, and Adiabene: Three Regna Minora of Northern Mesopotamia Between East and West, 2017. pp. 212-214 Corduene in Jewish sources This region is traditionally identified with the landing site in Deluge mythology. In the targumim, Noah's landing place after the flood is given as 'Qadron' or 'Qardu'. Jacob Neusner identifies the targumim's locations with Corduene.Jacob Neusner, The Jews in Pagan Armenia, Journal of the American Oriental Society, pp.230-240, 1964, p.233 According to the Aggadah, Noah landed in Corduene in Armenia. The early 3rd century BCE Babylonian writer Berossus was also of the opinion that Xisthros landed with his ship in Corduene.Bernhard Heller, Ginzberg's Legends of the Jews, The Jewish Quarterly Review, pp.51-66, Center for Advanced Judaic Studies, University of Pennsylvania, 1933, p.57 Josephus cited the evidence of Berossus as proof that the Flood was not a myth and also mentioned that the remains of the Ark were still visible in the district of Carron, presumably identical with Korduene.Louis H. Feldman, Josephus' Portrait of Noah and Its Parallels in Philo, Pseudo-Philo's Biblical Antiquities and Rabbinic Midrashim, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, pp.31-57, 1988, p.47 In Nashim, the third order of Talmud, Rav Nahman bar Jacob has allowed proselytization of Kurds from Corduene.Heinrich Walter Guggenheimer, The Jerusalem Talmud, Halakhah 6, 2004, , pp.62-63 Jewish sources trace the origins of the people of Corduene to the marriage of Jinns of King Solomon with 500 beautiful Jewish women.Baron Patrick Balfour Kinross, Within the Taurus: a journey in Asiatic Turkey, 1970, 191 pages, see p. 89George Smith, The Cornhill Magazine, Volume 167, 1954, sp. 228Peter Sch√§fer, Catherine Hezser, The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman Culture, Volume 3, Mohr Siebeck, 2002 ‚Äì 486 pages, s p. 80Adolf B√ºchler, Studies in Jewish history, Oxford University Press, 1956, 279 pages, s p. 84Israel Abrahams, Adolf B√ºchler, The Foundations of Jewish life: three studies, Arno Press, 1973, 512 pages, s p. 84 Corduene in Roman sources Castle of Pinaca (or Finik), northwest of Cizre According to the Greek historian and geographer Strabo, the region of Gorduene (, or , \\"Gordyaean Mts\\") referred to the mountains between Diyarbakƒ±r and Mu≈ü. He recorded its main cities as Sareisa, Satalca and Pinaca (northwest of Bezabde), and considered its inhabitants (Gordyaeans) as descendants of the ancient Carduchians. According to him, the inhabitants had an exceptional repute as master-builders and as experts in the construction of siege engines and for this reason Tigranes used them in such work; he also notices the country for its naphtha resources.LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢ Strabo's Geography ‚Äî Book XVI Chapter 1 Ammianus Marcellinus visited this region while on a diplomatic visit to the satrap of Corduene.Ronald Syrme, Anatolica: Studies in Strabo, Oxford University Press, 1995, , p.30 Eretrians who were exiled and deported by the Persians to Mesopotamia, were said to have taken up their dwelling in the region of Gordyene.Strabo, Geography, Book XVI, Chapter 1, p.233-235 According to Strabo the Gordyaeans received their name from Gordys son of Triptolemus, who assisted in searching after Io, and then settled in Gordyaea district of Phrygia. Pompey and Corduene Roman dependency of Corduene (as of 31 BC) Castle of Pinaca (or Finik), northwest of Cizre Both Phraates III and Tigranes the Great laid claim to this province. However, it was conquered by the Roman troops under Pompey. The local population (called Gordyeni) did not defend the Armenian rule since according to Plutarch, Tigranes had demolished their native cities and had forced them into exile in Tigranocerta.The Life of Lucullus, in The Parallel Lives by Plutarch. In 69 BC, Zarbienus, the king of Corduene, was secretly planning for a revolt against Tigranes. He was negotiating with Appius Claudius for Roman help. However the plan was revealed and he was killed by Tigranes. After this, Lucullus raised a monument to Zarbienus and then he took over the region of Corduene.T. Frank, Two Suggestions on the Text of Cicero, The American Journal of Philology, pp.459-461, 1937. He took part in the funeral of Zarbienus, offered royal robes, gold and the spoils (taken from Tigranes), and called him his companion and confederate of the Romans.Lives , Chapter 36, Plutarch. After Pompey's success in subjugating Armenia and part of Pontus, and the Roman advance across the Euphrates, Phraates was anxious to have a truce with the Romans. However, Pompey held him in contempt and demanded back the territory of Corduene. He sent envoys, but after receiving no answer, he sent Afranius into the territory and occupied it without a battle. The Parthians who were found in possession were driven beyond the frontier and pursued even as far as Arbela in Adiabene.Cassius Dio ‚Äî Book 37 According to an inscription dedicated to the temple of Venus, Pompey gave protection to the newly acquired territory of Gordyene.G.

Armenian presence  Map showing Corduene as a vassal Kingdom of Armenian Empire. Tigran retained Gordyene and Nisibis, which Pompeius withheld from the Parthians.The Kingdom of Armenia - Page 205 by Mack Chahin Gordyene belonged to Urartu for about 200 years and to Armenia for about 250 years.The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times - Page 15 by Richard G. Hovhannisian Districts of Cordyene under Armenian period were: : Korduq (or Korduk), Kordiq Nerkin, Kordiq Verin, Kordiq Mijin, Tshauk, Aitvanq, Vorsirank (or Orsirank), Aigarq, Motolanq, Kartuniq, Albag. Diocletian and Corduene Corduene was conquered again by Diocletian in the 3rd century and the Roman presence in the region was formally recognized in a peace treaty signed between Diocletian and the Persians. Diocletian then raised an army unit from this region under the title Ala XV Flavia Carduenorum, naming it after his Caesar Flavius Valerius Constantinus.E.C. Nischer, The Army Reforms of Diocletian and Constantine and Their Modifications up to the Time of the Notitia Dignitatum, The Journal of Roman Studies, pp.1-55, 1923. (see p.10) Following the defeat of Narseh, the Sassanid King, at the hands of the Romans in 296, a peace treaty was signed between the two sides, according to which the steppes of northern Mesopotamia, with Singara and the hill country on the left bank of the Tigris as far as Gordyene (Corduene), were also ceded to the victors (Romans).Narses - Britannica Online Encyclopedia The name of the province appears again in the account of the campaign between the Persians led by Shapur II and the Romans led by Julian the Apostate (and after Julian's death, by Jovian). The Romans started to retreat through Corduene after they could not besiege Ctesiphon. Shapur's campaign against Corduene Korduene in northern and northeastern Mesopotamia; map from the Encyclopaedia Biblica In the spring of 360, Shapur II staged a campaign to capture the city of Singara (probably modern Shingar or Sinjar northwest of Mosul). The town fell after a few days of siege. From Singara, Shapur directed his march almost due northwards, and leaving Nisibis unassailed upon his left, proceeded to attack the strong fort known indifferently as Pinaca (Phaenicha) or Bezabde. This was a position on the east bank of the Tigris, near the point where that river quits the mountains and debouches upon the plain; though not on the site, it may be considered the representative of the modern Jezireh (Cizre in southeastern Turkey), which commands the passes from the low country into the Kurdish mountains. It was much valued by Rome, was fortified in places with a double wall, and was guarded by three legions and a large body of Kurdish archers. Shapur sent a flag of truce to demand a surrender, joining with the messengers some prisoners of high rank taken at Singara, lest the enemy should open fire upon his envoys. The device was successful; but the garrison proved staunch, and determined on resisting to the last. After a long siege, the wall was at last breached, the city taken, and its defenders indiscriminately massacred.The Seven Great Monarchies, by George Rawlinson, The Seventh Monarchy, Part A In 363, a treaty was signed in which Jovian ceded five provinces beyond the Euphrates including Corduene and Arzanene and towns of Nisibis and Singara to the Sassanids. Following this treaty, Greeks living in those lands emigrated due to persecution of Christians at the hands of Shapur and the Zoroastrians.J. B.

WCAO-FM originally simulcast WCAO, but by the late 1960s/early 1970s, WCAO-FM had switched to its own classical music format. =V-103 (1977‚Äì97)= By 1977, the station was sold to Plough Broadcasting and became WXYV V103, the major FM rival to both WWIN and WEBB (now WQLL). Originally an automated Disco format, WXYV eventually evolved into an Urban Contemporary format by the early 1980s, and by the late 1980s and early 1990s, it was Baltimore's top rated radio station. By 1995, WXYV and then-sister station WCAO were sold to Granum Communications. The following year, the stations were sold again to Infinity Broadcasting, becoming a sister station to Hot AC-formatted WWMX, Mix 106.5. (WCAO would later be sold to Clear Channel Communications (now iHeartMedia), and eventually become a sister station to WQSR.) =102.7 XYV, and B102.7 (1997‚Äì2001)= On June 20, 1997, at Noon, after having lost a large number of listeners to urban powerhouse WERQ, the station became Top 40 102.7 XYV. The final song on V103 was \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" by Boyz II Men, while the first song on 102.7 XYV was \\"Be My Lover\\" by La Bouche.http://formatchange.com/urban-v103-becomes- chr-1027-xyv/http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1997/RR-1997-07-04.pdf The new format started with a dance lean, before repositioning to a hip-hop lean, and then alternative; this was done in search of an audience. The station changed branding to B102.7 on August 7, 1998, and would shift their playlist to a more mainstream direction the following year.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-08-14.pdf WXYV and WWMX would \\"compete\\" against each other due to the similarity of the Top 40 and Hot AC formats, despite being sister stations. While WXYV had higher ratings than WWMX, the latter station had better advertising revenue, so WXYV was chosen to flip to end the competition. =WQSR (2001‚Äìpresent)= On September 8, 2001, at 6 a.m., after playing \\"It's So Hard to Say Goodbye to Yesterday\\" by Boyz II Men, WQSR and its oldies format moved over from 105.7 to 102.7. (WQSR programming was simulcast on both 102.7 and 105.7 to direct listeners to the new frequency.) Two days later, the WXYV call sign moved to 105.7 and changed back to an urban contemporary format branding as X105.7, positioning itself against WERQ once again. The call sign swap between the two stations took place 4 days later.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/2000s/2001/RR-2001-09-21.pdf In addition, WQSR acquired the rights to Baltimore Ravens games from sister station WLIF, and retained those rights until 2006, when WBAL and WIYY took over. Musically, WQSR's playlist also changed a little, cutting back the pre-1964 songs and some 1980s music was introduced. By 2003, the station was playing strictly songs from 1964 to 1979 with a handful of pre-1964 and post-1979 titles. On May 4, 2005, at 10:30 a.m., after playing \\"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\\" by Steam, the station began a half-hour stunt; at 11, the station officially flipped to adult hits, branded as 102-7 Jack FM. The first song on \\"Jack\\" was \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" by Duran Duran. Infinity Broadcasting would be renamed CBS Radio in December 2005. On December 15, 2008, CBS Radio announced that it would be swapping WQSR and four of its other medium-market radio stations to Clear Channel Communications for two radio stations, KLOL and KHMX in Houston. Clear Channel took over WQSR at 11:59 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31, 2009. After playing songs at CBS Radio's Baltimore studios such as \\"End of the Road\\" by Boyz II Men, R.E.M.'s \\"It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)\\" and \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" by Supertramp at roughly 11:57 p.m., the station went to dead air as Clear Channel officially took ownership of the station. Shortly thereafter, the station returned to the air at the Clear Channel Baltimore studios. The sale also resulted in the station reuniting with former sister WCAO under common ownership for the first time since 1998. WQSR in its current incarnation as Jack FM runs a strictly jockless Variety Hits format. Although there are no on-air personalities on the station, the station airs Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 1980s on Sunday nights from 7pm-11pm (though before August 4, 2019 the start time was an hour later).

It deals with finding the proper value of individual securities (i.e., stocks and bonds). These are usually classified into debt securities, equities, or some hybrid of the two. Tradeable credit derivatives are also securities. Commodities or futures contracts are not securities. They are distinguished from securities by the fact that their performance is not dependent on the management or activities of an outside or third party. Options on these contracts are however considered securities, since performance is now dependent on the activities of a third party. The definition of what is and what is not a security comes directly from the language of a United States Supreme Court decision in the case of SEC v. W. J. Howey Co.. Security analysis for the purpose to state the effective value of an enterprise is typically based on the examination of fundamental business factors such as financial statements, going concern, business strategy and forecasts.

It was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 1984, but lost out to William Gibson's Neuromancer; both novels were part of the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series edited by Terry Carr.  Plot summary  The plot is built around three separate but interconnected stories woven through the novel. The first is set in 1929, where archaeologists in Louisiana excavating a mound of the Coles Creek culture encounter the skeleton of a horse, a seeming impossibility as the mound predates the re-introduction of the horse to North America. The mystery deepens when one of the archaeologists discovers something in the mound even more anachronistic: a corroded brass rifle cartridge. The second is the first-person narrative of Madison Yazoo Leake, a soldier in the United States Army and a member of the \\"Special Group\\" being sent back in time to 1930s Louisiana in an attempt to stop the destruction of the human race in a nuclear war. However, while Leake arrives at the target site, it is in a world where Arabs explored America, the Roman Empire never existed, and the Aztec empire extended to the Mississippi. The only member of his team to arrive at this destination, he soon establishes contact with a group of mound-builders who gradually befriend him. The final narrative is based on the diary entries of Warrant Officer Smith, another member of the Special Group. She arrives with the rest of the team of military and CIA personnel in what apparently is their timeline, only hundreds of years earlier than intended. Through her diary entries and the count of those members present for duty the story of their interactions with the local natives in their pre-Columbian world.

It is loosely based on the first six episodes of the Tenchi Muyo! Ryo- Ohki OVA series. The series premiered on April 2, 1995 in Japan and concluded its airing on September 24, 1995. The series aired in the United States on Cartoon Network's cartoon block Toonami on July 20, 2000 and ended on August 24, 2000. Two featured films came from this canon, Tenchi the Movie: Tenchi Muyo in Love and Tenchi Forever! The Movie. Funimation announced distribution of the series, along with several other Tenchi properties, on July 2, 2010 at Anime Expo.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-02/funi-adds-live- action-moyashimon This series introduces three new characters: Mihoshi's partner Kiyone Makibi (who debuted in the \\"Mihoshi Special\\"), the bounty hunter and Ryoko's rival, Nagi, and her cabbit companion, Ken-Ohki. The series also gave some characters different personalities; Washu is now portrayed as a mildly-insane egomaniac with two pop-up dolls that proclaim her greatness, and Mihoshi was portrayed as a comic relief character whose constant bumbling, blunders and crying fits would often get the gang into trouble. Story Long ago, a legendary warrior and crowned prince of the Juraian Empire, Yosho, disappeared and never to be heard again. Unknown to the Juraian Empire, Yosho never wanted to become a ruler and only wanted a quiet peaceful life; he settled on Earth. He discovered the Misaki Shrine and married the daughter of the Misaki priest, Itsuki Masaki; he would rename himself as Katsuhito Masaki. The two later had a daughter, Lady Achika Masaki, princess of Jurai. She would later marry her high school love, Nobuyuki, and the two had Tenchi. Unfortunately, Achika died from illness one snowy winter; Nobuyuki and Katsuhito helped raise Tenchi in the country side, near the Misaki Family Shrine. Tenchi's life was at first normal, but things quickly changed when intergalactic alien girls started coming into his life. At 17, Tenchi's life was dramatically changed by the appearance of Space Pirate Ryoko. Evading the Galaxy Police (GXP), Ryoko was piloting her spaceship and cabbit, Ryo-Ohki, and battled with GXP officer Mihoshi when both crash-landed near Tenchi's home. Tenchi found an unconscious Ryoko and tended to her. When she awakened, she gave a fantastic story of how she's being pursued by a terrible space pirate, temporarily earning the Misaki family's trust and gaining their shelter. However, Ryoko's lies easily fell apart when it was discovered her pursuer was actually the GXP and Ryoko is the true pirate. Unfortunately, with Mihoshi's ship destroyed, it was pointless to arrest Ryoko; both girls stayed at the hospitality of the Misaki house. Desiring to return home, Mihoshi activated an emergency beacon and it was detected by Juraian Princess Ayeka. When Ayeka arrived, she was shocked to find her old nemesis, Ryoko, was there. Starting a fight, the two battled each other by ship combat and both lost their ships in battle; Ayeka ended as the recent addition to the Misaki household, along with her robotic wooden guardians, Azaka and Kamidake. Not long, Ayeka's little sister, Princess Sasami, had arrived to rescue her sister. It was around this time that Ryoko revealed that her ship can regenerate itself. In her cabbit form, Ryo-Ohki developed a great love for carrots and couldn't get enough of them. By the time Sasami arrived, both Ayeka and Ryoko developed romantic feelings for Tenchi. Reluctant to leave, it was time for everyone to part ways. Unfortunately, Sasami accidentally had a carrot with her and it attracted Ryo-Ohki. The cabbit couldn't resist the lure of the carrot and collided with each other's ships, causing everyone to be stranded on Earth. The final two ladies to arrive would be legendary mad scientist Washu and Mihoshi's partner, Kiyone. Washu was imprisoned in a special crystal prison for her crimes of creating time-space devices with devastating effects upon the galaxy. Washu's crystal crash-landed in Japan and the inhabitants founded the Misaki Shrine to prevent people accessing the crystal, correctly assuming it's not a safe object. However, thanks to Ryoko's intervention, she was accidentally freed. She eventually set up a dimensional closet within the Misaki house, allowing her to cross dimensions between her lab and the Misaki family. Lastly, Kiyone was sent to find Mihoshi. After finding her, the two were assigned to patrol and tour the solar system; it's a severe downgrade. Both lived away from Tenchi's home and have their own place in the city, but due to Mihoshi's frequent blunders, making a living on Earth and balancing GXP duties was hard and Kiyone curses her fortunes because of it. Despite the occasional flares in battles between Ayeka and Ryoko, life was relatively alright until the Juraian military had come for the princesses. Unknown to the princesses, the Juraian royal hierarchy of power was usurped by the sudden return of Yosho; it was actually Kagato in disguise. Yosho and Kagato both battled for the succession of Jurai in the past and Kagato lost. However, with Yosho conveniently missing, Kagato took his place as the long lost direct heir to the throne. Kagato then used his royal authority to have the military arrest and prosecute both princesses in an attempt to solidify his dominance in Jurai. However, Tenchi and the girls helped freed them and were on the run. Although not originally involved, the GXP was also under the influence of the Juraian Empire and Mihoshi managed to learn about the corrupted collusion between the GXP and Jurai; it made both Mihoshi and Kiyone fugitives. Framed for crimes of treason and terrorism against the crown, the whole group is on the run from the Juraian Empire and the GXP; they journey to Jurai in attempts to clear their names. Being on the run was a difficult process. The group had to escape detection from local authorities on top of the GXP, but also make money in between to cover costs for food, fuel, and repairs to their ship. Things were often complicated due to Mihoshi's constant blundering nature as well as Ryoko's selfish nature. On top of that, Ryoko is also evading a long rival, Space Hunter Nagi, while committing major thefts to help sustain the group. However, the group managed to make it to the inner Juraian System. Disguising their ship and themselves as a school group, the team had success infiltrating Juraian security thanks to Washu's anti- detection measures; it was once again fumbled by Mihoshi. Nearly unable to escape, the group was secretly aided by a loyalist to escape. While on their way to Jurai, Mihoshi's clumsy nature got them detected by a Jurian warship. However, Katsuhito instructed the crew how to escape capture: by entering a forbidden Juraian planet. Because it's a sacred place that nobody is allowed except Juraian royalty, their pursuers was forced to stand down until permitted entry. In order to take back Jurai, the team is going to need powerful warriors. Yosho decided to resurrect two legendary Juraian knights, the real bodies of Azaka and Kamidake, to aid in their quest. Although the Juraian knights have returned, their robotic counterparts were deactivated to bring them back. It was there that Katsuhito revealed himself as the true Yosho and the knights pledged loyalty to Yosho as their king. It was at a Juraian villa that Yosho explained the nature of their enemy, Kagato, and his past. A rival and Juraian heir, Kagato became too obsessed with power and it caused him to abuse his Juraian powers. Yosho was forced to face his rival and defeated him in battle, but didn't kill him. Kagato disappeared into the darkness and it was around the same time that Yosho decided to quietly settle down on Earth. Due to the shame and disgrace of Kagato's actions, the Juraian royalty erased the existence of Kagato, explaining why the princesses never heard about Kagato. However, Yosho's identity also pointed out that Tenchi is a direct heir to Jurai's crown. On the eve before facing Kagato, both Tenchi and Ayeka was affected by recent news the most. Tenchi always saw himself as a normal high school boy, not heir to a major power in the galaxy; Ayeka was happy about it. She always knew her vacation on Earth would eventually end and she would have to bid farewell. However, with Tenchi as a direct heir, they can be together at each other's side for a long time, something Ryoko wasn't happy about. However, romantic intentions have to hold as Kagato appeared. Kagato appeared for a private rematch with Yosho. Unfortunately, Kagato found a way to maintain his youth and also increased his powers; the aged Yosho lost the battle. Ryoko joined the battle, but was critically injured. Kagato then kidnaps Ayeka and flees. In critical condition, Yosho encouraged Tenchi to face his destiny with courage. Motivated to end the dark reign of Kagato, Tenchi and the royal knights journeyed to Jurai to face Kagato. Still injured from her fight, Ryoko pleaded with Tenchi to run away with her, but he wasn't swayed; Ryoko offered to take the trio to Jurai. After Ryo-Ohki crash-landed on Jurai, Tenchi and his guardians stormed the palace. Kagato had his own dark royal knights and they tried to stop Tenchi, but Azaka and Kamidake defeated them both. In between, the rest of the girls managed to hold up the Jurian battle fleet by infecting their computers with a computer virus Washu created. Ryoko was severely injured helping Tenchi, losing a lot of blood, she lost consciousness due to her injuries and her fate unknown. Now at the palace throne, Kagato fought against Tenchi. At first, Tenchi was losing, but the Juraian trees reacted to Tenchi and empowered him to rival Kagato. Theorizing Jurai itself has chosen its own master, Kagato angrily fought against Tenchi and lost; he admitted defeat and died and Tenchi saved Ayeka. In the aftermath, there was a great media storm over past events. Everyone accused of crimes against the Juraian Empire have been exonerated. Yosho survived his ordeal and was happily treated by a group of pretty Juraian nurses. Ayeka decided not to punish anyone involved with Kagato, but the conspirators themselves quietly resigned to avoid retribution. Washu's involvement made her an honorary president of the Universal Science Academy and she vowed to use her skills for peace; barely a month later, she was ousted for developing a weapon that could destroy the whole universe. At the GXP, Kiyone got promoted to Detective Sergeant and Mihoshi promoted to Chief Criminal Prevention Officer (albeit avoiding her responsibilities to hang with Kiyone). Azaka and Kamidake are no longer royal guardians, but chose to continue serving the princesses. Their robotic counterparts was resurrected thanks to Washu and returns to Ayeka's side. However, Ryoko's fate remains unknown. As for Tenchi, he has no interest in succeeding as Jurai's next ruler; he just wants to return to Earth and live a normal life. However, there was no mention who would fill in the power vacuum. Tenchi resumes life back as it was, but find it hard to adapt after living with so many girls; he misses them. Just as he thought of them, Ryoko appears before him. She affectionately hugs him and declares that she intends to fairly win Tenchi's heart. It was also around this time that Washu decided to return to Earth. Kiyone and Mihoshi returns to Earth as well, taking back their old apartment. Ayeka decides to run away and return to Tenchi's side; Sasami decides to also run off and the guardians joins in as well. The story ends with all the girls coming back into his life once again.

Like Ry≈ç-Ohki, Ken-Ohki can transform himself into a space battleship, although the configuration and color is slightly different from Ry≈ç-Ohki. And like Ry≈ç-Ohki, Ken-Ohki has developed a love of carrots. Ken- Ohki and Ry≈ç-Ohki also love each other, which complicates Nagi's almost obsessive quest to capture Ry≈çko. But this love had also saved Nagi from being killed by Ry≈çko, not to mention aiding Ry≈çko when she, Tenchi, and the knights Azaka and Kamidake stormed the Jurai palace to save Ayeka. * : This android duplicate of Wash≈´ was supposed to be a supplemental worker, imprinted with the mad genius's intellect. But somehow, a single hair from Mihoshi found its way into the transfer unit. It was after an explosion (caused by Mihoshi) that Wash≈´ discovered that, instead of Wash≈´'s mind, the android gains Mihoshi's mind and temperament. Wash≈´ also developed a spare body for Mecha-Wash≈´ which she used after Wash≈´ self-detonated her original body and the spare body is not equipped with a self-destruct device. The group had a hard time dealing with Mecha-Wash≈´ until Kiyone came by, as she knew how Mihoshi's mind works, which enabled her to shut down Mecha-Wash≈´. Mecha-Wash≈´ has most of Wash≈´'s physical features, but with Mihoshi's ear and eye characteristics, as well as her hairstyle. Eventually Wash≈´ tried to create a second Mecha-Wash≈´ but Ry≈ç- Ohki somehow caused it to gain her characteristics. * : Mitsuki graduated from the same Galaxy Police Academy class Kiyone graduated from, but at a lower score. She is a very ambitious person, and will stoop to anything to get ahead of Kiyone... even capturing her when Kiyone got implicated in Ayeka's problems with Jurai. At the end of the series, Mitsuki was demoted to being Kiyone's errand girl, following Kiyone's promotion to Detective Sergeant and Mihoshi's promotion to Chief Criminal Prevention Officer. * : Mirei is a mysterious ghost girl whose life before she died is unknown to her, although she has a photograph which is her only clue. When the Yagami stopped in the Sargasso sea of space a.k.a. the ship's graveyard, that was when Mirei's ship appeared before them. She invited Sasami and Ry≈ç-ohki on board, after which the two started to have fun and decided to scare the rest of the group, who had come aboard to look for Sasami. Then after sampling Sasami's memories, Mirei, Sasami, and Ry≈ç-ohki continued to play through things such as an amusement park and a fireworks display. Eventually Sasami realized she had to return to the Yagami as everyone was worried. But as a gift, Sasami and Ry≈ç-ohki's image were added to the photograph to help remember their happiest time together. * and : Basically, the two of them are runaways, and just happened to steal Kiyone's ship Yagami, (with an unknowing Nobuyuki and Katsuhito on board who were playing Shiogi, a Japanese version of chess) when the Masaki clan stopped at a station to order beef dons. Of course, the two of them didn't know about the trouble the Masakis were in, and soon found themselves chased by the G.P. and Jurai... something they never counted on! Eventually they ended up flying towards a star, but the Masaki group (minus Ayeka and Sasami) arrived on Ry≈ç- ohki, retaken the ship, and used Washu's calculations to use the sun's gravity to escape. They then sent Amarube and Yura away on an escape pod. * : During the Masaki clan's trip through the Jurai checkpoint, Sagami met Tenchi (disguised as a girl named Tenko) after he went to check-in station. Sagami then went to the Cafe with Sasami and Tenchi, but after Ry≈çko and Mihoshi came through when Mihoshi's bungling had exposed them, Sagami was able to help slow down some of the guards. Later when Sasami was separated from the group, Sagami knocked out the guards that heard her and then gave Tenchi a staff to fight off the guards, although it exposed Tenchi's true identity to him. It turned out that Sagami was an agent of Sasami and Ayeka's uncle and was helping the group in order for them to make it into Jurai territory. * : While in disguise on Jurai's checkpoint to get into the Jurai territory, Sasami remembered the time when she used to play with her uncle on Jurai. However, her uncle, who was the outpost chief for the checkpoint, easily recognized her through her disguise. He helped weaken the security grid and had his man Sagami assist the Masaki clan in getting away when they were discovered, giving them a chance to escape from the checkpoint into Jurai territory. He also helped rescue Sasami after she was separated from the group and then rendered unconscious by knockout gas; he then got her back to the group safely. It was only after their escape that Sasami saw him as they were leaving and realized that her uncle had helped them escape, and he realized how much Sasami had grown up. It's also implied that he knew the current emperor was not the real Yosho. * and : Tetta and Tessei are the Juraian knights that served Kagato. The knights Azaka and Kamidake each faced these two knights respectively. Although both Tetta and Tessei were just as skilled as Azaka and Kamidake and had techniques that weren't available in Azaka and Kamidake's time, both of the noble knights pointed out that they, along with their master, lacked the spirit of chivalry. With their courage and nobility, Azaka and Kamidake killed Tetta and Tessei. * : Y≈çsh≈ç's (Katsuhito) wife in the TV series continuity and Achika's mother. Itsuki briefly appears in Episode 22 and Tenchi Forever! The Movie, when Y≈çsh≈ç explains that after he met her shortly after landing on Earth, he changed his name Katsuhito Masaki when he married her. It was because of this that the spirit of Y≈çsh≈ç's deceased love Haruna awoke and felt betrayed, that she would later kidnap Tenchi. Itsuki made a brief appearance at the end of Tenchi Muyo in Love 2 where after Katsuhito said goodbye to Haruna, Itsuki's spirit appeared in her child form and Katsuhito pointed out to her not to be jealous. Broadcast history Tenchi Universe was broadcast on TV Tokyo from 2 April 1995 to 24 September 1995. The English-dubbed version of Tenchi Universe first appeared on San Jose PBS member station Superstation KTEH (now KQEH) in 1997 in its original, uncut and uncensored form, as part of its Sunday Late-Prime (9pm- after 12) Sci-Fi programming line-up, and was later picked up by Cartoon Network in 2000 for wider broadcast on its Toonami block (US and Europe). The Toonami version was edited for content, and featured custom opening and closing credits. After Cartoon Network's rights to broadcast the show expired, the now-defunct International Channel picked up the rights to air the dubbed version in 2004. In South America, a Spanish dub (co-produced in Chile by Cloverway Inc.) was broadcast on Univision, while the Brazilian-Portuguese version was dubbed on Herbert Richers and was broadcast only on FTA channels TV Bandeirantes and Rede 21.

The University of Music and Performing Arts Munich (), also sometimes called the Academy of Music and Performing Arts, is one of the most respected traditional vocational universities in Germany, specialising in music and the performing arts. The main building it currently occupies is the former F√ºhrerbau of the NSDAP, located at Arcisstra√üe 12, on the eastern side of the K√∂nigsplatz, Munich. Teaching and other events also take place at Luisenstra√üe 37a, Gasteig, the Prinzregententheater (theatre studies), and in Wilhelmstra√üe (ballet). Since 2008, the Richard Strauss Conservatory (de), until then independent, has formed part of the University. History In 1846, a private institution called the Royal Conservatory of Music (K√∂nigliches Conservatorium f√ºr Musik) was founded, and in 1867, at the suggestion of Richard Wagner, this was transformed by King Ludwig II into the Royal Bavarian Music School (K√∂nigliche bayerische Musikschule), financed privately by Ludwig II until gaining the status of a state institution in 1874. It has since been renamed several times: to the Royal Academy of the Art of Music (K√∂nigliche Akademie der Tonkunst), the State Academy of Music (Staatliche Akademie der Tonkunst), the University for Music (Hochschule f√ºr Musik) and finally to the present name in 1998. Its original location, the Odeonsgeb√§ude, was destroyed in 1944. The current building was constructed for the Nazi party by Paul Troost and was called the F√ºhrerbau. Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler signed the Munich Agreement in this building in 1938. Hitler's office, on the second floor above the main entrance, is now a rehearsal room, but has been changed little since it was built.

Education Educated at Edinburgh Academy and the University of Edinburgh where he gained a BSc in Agriculture, Murray went into employment with the Ministry of Agriculture from 1925 to 1926. He was then awarded a Commonwealth Fund Fellowship, and spent three years at Cornell University where he was awarded a PhD. In 1929 he attended Oriel College, Oxford, and the Agricultural Economics Research Institute (AERI) until 1932. Career He became a Research Officer for the AERI, a post he held until 1944. In 1937, however, he was appointed a Fellow and Bursar of Lincoln College, Oxford, as well as being appointed by the University to Oxford City Council. On the death of the Rector J. A. R. Munro in 1944, he was elected to the Rectorship, a position he held until his retirement in 1953. He became the first Rector since Nathaniel Crew not to die in office.

CroFab is composed of several monovalent Fragment antigen-binding proteins (Fab) derived from the blood of sheep immunized with one of four snake venom: Crotalus atrox (western diamondback rattlesnake), Crotalus adamanteus (Eastern diamondback rattlesnake), Crotalus scutulatus (Mojave rattlesnake), or Agkistrodon piscivorus (Cottonmouth or Water Moccasin). Each monospecific antivenin is purified from sheep serum, digested with the enzyme papain, and purified further resulting in specific Fab fragments. The resulting four different Fab preparations are mixed to formulate the final product.  Background  It was developed by the Venom Immunochemistry, Pharmacology and Emergency Response (VIPER) Institute, University of Arizona, and commercialized by BTG plc (formerly Protherics PLC). As reported in the Washington Post in July 2015, this was the only commercially available antivenin in the United States for the treatment of venomous snakebites until the release of a competing product, ANAVIP.  Treatment  Crotalid snakebites can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on the size and type of snake, the amount of venom injected and the location of the bite. This in turn determines the number of vials of CroFab that are required by the patient. Untreated, the snake venom can cause severe pain and tissue damage that can result in the loss of a limb or even death. Prompt (within six hours of snake bite) treatment with CroFab is recommended. 'Fab' refers to Fragment Antigen-Binding, the active mechanism for this antivenom. Adverse events The most common adverse events reported in clinical studies were mild or moderate reactions involving the skin and appendages (primarily urticaria, rash, or pruritus), which occurred in 14 out of 42 patients. Three patients experienced a serious adverse event. Two patients had a severe allergic reaction (severe hives and a severe rash and pruritus) following treatment. One patient had a recurrent coagulopathy due to envenomation, which required re-hospitalisation and additional antivenin administration. In clinical trials, recurrent coagulopathy (the return of a coagulation abnormality after it has been successfully treated with antivenin), characterised by decreased fibrinogen, decreased platelets and elevated prothrombin time, occurred in approximately half of the patients studied. Recurrent coagulopathy may persist for one to two weeks or more. One patient discontinued CroFab therapy due to an allergic reaction. Patients with allergies to papain, chymopapain, other papaya extracts or the pineapple enzyme bromelain may also be at risk for an allergic reaction to CroFab. Cost Leslie Boyer, Director of the VIPER Institute, who was on the team that developed CroFab, said they were \\"crestfallen\\" to discover that the wholesale price of Anascorp, their latest antivenom, was too high to be cost effective, even in the treatment of critically ill children. The industry website Fierce Pharma called the product a ‚Äúdrug launch disaster‚Äù and ‚Äúone of the most bizarre marketing tales in the industry.‚Äù Boyer said that CroFab, a US drug whose sister product retailed in Mexico at $100, was resulting in bills to Arizona patients of between $7,900 and $39,652 per vial. One person rejected treatment and died because he couldn't afford to pay for it. Boyer collected data on the cost of production and marketing, and found that the largest true cost to payers, $4100/vial, was that of the legal, regulatory and hospital activities involved in selling the drug. Clinical trials contributed $300/vial, and 25% of that had been paid for by government grants. Other costs were the same as in Mexico.

In South Africa, the Nomad name was used on a small utility vehicle. The Nomad is best remembered in its two-door Tri-Five form that was considered a halo model during its three-year production. It was named for nomads. The resourceful crime-fighter, activist, and action-hero Angus MacGyver drives a teal-blue '57 Chevy Nomad with white roof and trim-accents during some of his episodes; like his 1946 beige-and-brown Chevy pickup, this car was left to him by his late grandfather, Harry Jackson. Pre production The two-door Nomad differed from other station wagons of the era by having unique styling more reminiscent of a hardtop sedan than that of a standard station wagon. Chevrolet shared this body with Pontiac, which marketed its version as the Pontiac Safari. The Nomad's unique design had its roots in a General Motors Motorama show car of the same name that was shared with the Corvette, Pontiac Bonneville Special, and the Oldsmobile F-88. The Concept was introduced at the GM Motorama in 1954 as one of Head Stylist Harley Earl's \\"dream cars\\". It followed the introduction in 1950 of the Ford Country Squire two-door station wagon. GM approved production of the vehicle if the design could be transferred to its standard model because top GM brass felt that they could sell more models if it were attached to the popular Bel Air model. Following the product debut in 1955, it was not uncommon for the car to be referred to as the Chevy \\"Bel Air Nomad\\". First generation: 1955‚Äì1957 *1955 Chevrolets received all-new styling. Advertised as \\"The Hot One,\\" the boxy new Chevy was crisp, clean, and thoroughly modern-looking, and its popularity was shared with the Tri-Five Chevrolets of this generation. Nomads, like Bel Airs, came loaded with interior carpet, chrome spears on front fenders, chrome window moldings, and full wheel covers. For 1955, Chevrolets gained a V8 engine option. The new V8 featured a modern, overhead valve, high compression, short stroke design that was so good that it remained in production in various forms for many decades. The base V8 had a two-barrel carburetor and was rated at , and the \\"Power Pack\\" option featured a four-barrel carburetor and other upgrades yielding . Later in the year, a \\"Super Power Pack\\" option added high- compression and a further . It had room for six passengers. *1956 Chevrolets received a face-lift. This gave Chevys a more conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who did not like the 1955 front end. Nomads now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheet metal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. A padded dashboard was now available. For 1956 Chevy hid the gas cap behind a flip-down tail light on the left side. *1957 V-8 engine displacement grew to from 265 in 1957, with the \\"Super Turbo Fire V8\\" option producing with a fuel injection system. The vast majority of cars had engines with carburetors. While considered to be a milestone vehicle design, General Motors discontinued the original Nomad Sport Wagon at the end of the 1957 model year due to low sales and the introduction of a new body for 1958. Second generation: 1958‚Äì1961 *1958 For the 1958 model year, Chevrolet moved the Nomad name to its top-line four-door Bel Air-based station wagon, right above the new mid-priced Biscayne based Brookwood. This was the only four-door Bel Air-based Nomad station wagon. Like the rest of Chevrolet's 1958 full-size car line up, the Nomad featured Chevrolet's new \\"Safety-Girder\\" cruciform frame. Similar in layout to the frame adapted for the 1957 Cadillac, it featured box-section side rails and a boxed front cross member that bowed under the engine, these \\"x-frames\\" were used on other 1958 to 1964 Chevys, as well as Cadillac. The rear was tied together by a channel-section cross member. *1959 In 1959, the Nomad was transferred from the Bel Air to the expanded Impala model range, which had been the top-line Chevrolet two-door hardtop and convertible the previous year; Impala now became a separate model that included four-door cars. Nomad, still at the top was a six-passenger car. The other 1959 Chevrolet station wagons were the new Kingswood four-door, nine-passenger, the new Parkwood four-door six-passenger, the new Brookwood two-door six passengers, and Brookwood four-door six Passenger. With the Delray gone, the Biscayne-based Brookwood was now priced lowest. The Brookwood two-door marked the short-lived return of the two-door wagon and was the basis for the new-for-1959 El Camino. The El Camino carried mid-level Parkwood (Bel Air) exterior trim, with Brookwood (Biscayne) interior. *1960 For 1960, the Impala-based Nomad four-door was revised with more conventional styling. The Kingswood and the two-door Brookwood were dropped at the end of the year along with the El Camino. *1961 In 1961, all full-size Chevrolets were restyled on the existing GM B platform. The new body styling was more trim and boxy than the 1958-60 models. Chevrolet continued to use the Nomad name until the end of the 1961 model year when all Chevrolet station wagons adopted the names of the regular sedan models for 1962. The Nomad had body-on-frame construction, using the \\"X\\" frame to the end. Third generation: 1968‚Äì1972 Between 1968 and 1972 the names Nomad and Nomad Custom were applied to the lowest-priced Chevelle four-door station wagon model, below the Chevelle Greenbrier, Chevelle Concours, and Chevelle Concours Estate. *1968 For 1968, Chevelle got a new body style (though still under the 817 and 817 internal designations) emphasized the \\"Coke bottle\\" look even more. New Federal safety-mandated equipment included side marker lights on each fender, as well as shoulder belts for outboard front seat occupants on cars built after December 1, 1967. This explains why some '68s had shoulder belts, and some early-production cars did not. However, all '68s had anchored for the belts. Manual transmission cars got GM's \\"Air Injection Reactor (A.I.R)\\" smog pump, which added complexity under the hood. *1969 By 1969, each Chevrolet station wagon regained its own unique model name. All '69 Chevelles also got a new locking steering column, one year ahead of the Federal requirement. Headrests, required for all cars sold in the U.S. after January 1, 1969, were installed on all '69 GM cars. *1970 The 1970 Chevelle Nomad had even more restyling. Each head lamp was put in its own chrome housing and was no longer integrating into the grille. The body lines were less swept and a new integrated rear bumper was used. *1971 For 1971, all Chevelles got two big headlights in place of the quads, and GM mandated all divisions design their engines to run on lower-octane regular, low-lead or unleaded gasoline due to tightening emission requirements and in anticipation of the catalytic converter that would be used on 1975 and later models, necessitating the use of unleaded fuel. To permit usage of the lower-octane fuels, all engines featured low compression ratios (9:1 and lower; well below the 10.25-11.25:1 range on high-performance engines of 1970 and earlier). *1972 The last Nomad station wagon ended with the end of the second-generation Chevelle at the end of the 1972 model year. 1976 Chevy Vega wagon Nomad package In 1976, special Vega Nomad wagons were assembled with unique side window trim and filler panels (to make the 'b' pillars appear forward-slanted), tailgate rub strips, vinyl Nomad script identification.\\"Cheap Nomad; 1976 Chevy Vega,\\" by David Frank (BarnFinds; October 18, 2015)1976 Chevy Vega Nomad (TotallyCars.club) Chevy Van Nomad Chevy Van Nomad From 1977 to 1981, the Nomad name returned for a version of the full-size Chevrolet Van. The Nomad was a five-passenger vehicle with a single row of rear passenger seats and a large carpeted cargo area. Offered with plaid upholstery (equivalent to the Beauville trim) and two-tone paint, the Nomad combined the cargo and passenger van configurations. The Chevrolet Nomad van was also offered by GMC as the GMC Gaucho. South African Chevrolet Nomad In South Africa, a small utility vehicle called the Chevrolet Nomad appeared in 1976. To save development costs and to keep the price low, the ladder-framed vehicle was only available with rear-wheel drive and a locally built 2.5-liter cast-iron inline-four engine, also of Chevrolet origins. Nonetheless, a combination of ample ground clearance, a short wheelbase, and light-weight, meant that off-road capabilities remained respectable. The wheelbase is , and the ground clearance . It also has a sump guard and a sturdy steel box-section grille to protect the radiator and headlamps.Howard, p. 31 The Nomad was only available with an open two-door body, with a folding front window and an available soft-top or fiber-glass hardtop. The design was simple, entirely of flat panels designed for ease of construction and to enable local parts content to be maximized - at 82 percent it was the highest achieved yet in South Africa.Howard, pp. 33-34 The engine, also used in the Chevrolet 2500 as well as a host of other local GM products, was tuned down for improved lower-end torque. Now fitted with a Rochester carburetor it produces at 4000 rpm, enough for a top speed of in a period test. The front suspension proved weak, however, and by the time Chevrolet had redesigned it buyer resistance had already doomed the Nomad. Concept cars Reproduction of the 1954 Chevrolet Nomad concept 1979 Chevrolet Nomad II concept car The 2004 Chevrolet Nomad concept car, with design cues from the original 1954 Corvette-based Nomad Chevrolet produced several Nomad concept cars: 1954: Chevrolet Corvette Nomad was Harley Earl's Corvette-based concept introduced at the GM Motorama. It made its debut along with the 1954 Corvette Hardtop and 1954 Corvette Corvair. It is believed the car was crushed by GM after the event, although replicas exist. 1979: The front-wheel-drive Chevrolet Nomad II minivan concept, based on GM's X-platform, several years before the Dodge Caravan and Renault Espace. It received strong approval from the customer clinics, but General Motors decided to not produce it. 1999: Another Nomad concept was based on the first generation Camaro, powered by a V8. 2004: Another concept was based on the GM Kappa platform and resembled the 1954 Corvette-based Nomad show car. It had a 107-inch wheelbase and was 155.5 inches long.

The region, originally known as Media in pre-Islamic times, became known as Jibal (\\"mountain, hill\\") by the early Islamic geographers, due its mountainous layout. The name was progressively abandoned during the Seljuk era in the 11th-12th centuries, and was incorrectly called  øIrƒÅq(-i)  øAjamƒ´ (\\"Persian Iraq\\") to distinguish it from  øIrƒÅq(-i) Arab (\\"Arab Iraq\\") in Mesopotamia. According to the medieval historian and geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi, this course started taking place when the Seljuk sultans ruled both Iraq proper and Jibal, thus being addressed \\"sultan al-Iraq\\". However, the city of Hamadan in Jibal eventually became their capital, thus resulting in the region becoming known as Iraq, with the word Ajami (\\"Persian\\") being added. Following the Mongol invasion of Iran in the 13th-century, the name Jibal had become completely outdated. In the following century, the geographer Hamdallah Mustawfi was unaware of the name Jibal, and only knew it as 'Iraq-i Ajami'. It was regarded by him as sardsƒ´r (\\"cold zone\\"). Later, until the beginning of the 20th century, the term Iraq in Iran was used to refer to a much smaller region south of Saveh and west of Qom. This region was centered on Soltanabad, which was renamed later as Arak.

It was established in December 2003 and opened its permanent home in September 2016 with a ceremony led by President Barack Obama. Early efforts to establish a federally owned museum featuring African- American history and culture can be traced to 1915, although the modern push for such an organization did not begin until the 1970s. After years of little success, a much more serious legislative push began in 1988 that led to authorization of the museum in 2003. A site was selected in 2006, and a design submitted by Freelon Group/Adjaye Associates/Davis Brody Bond was chosen in 2009. Construction began in 2012 and the museum completed in 2016. The NMAAHC proved immediately popular, ranking as the fourth most-visited Smithsonian museum in its first full year of operation. The museum has more than 40,000 objects in its collection, although only about 3,500 items are on display. The , 10 story building (five above and five below ground) and its exhibits have won critical praise. History =Early efforts= The concept of a national museum dedicated to African-American history and culture can be traced back to the second decade of the 20th century. In 1915, African-American veterans of the Union Army met at the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church in Washington, D.C., for a reunion and parade. Frustrated with the racial discrimination they still faced, the veterans formed a committee to build a memorial to various African-American achievements. Their efforts paid off in 1929, when President Herbert Hoover appointed Mary Church Terrell, Mary McLeod Bethune, and 10 others to a commission charged with building a \\"National Memorial Building\\" showcasing African-American achievements in the arts and sciences. But Congress did not back the project, and private fundraising also failed. Although proposals for an African-American history and culture museum would be floated in Congress for the next 40 years, none gained more than minimal support. Proposals for a museum began circulating again in Congress in the early 1970s. In 1981, Congress approved a federal charter for a National Afro- American Museum in Wilberforce, Ohio. The museum, built and funded with private money, opened in 1987. In the early 1980s, Tom Mack (the African- American chairman of Tourmobile, a tourist bus company) founded the National Council of Education and Economic Development (NCEED). Mack's intention was to use the non-profit group to advance his ideas about economic development, education, and the arts in the black community. Emboldened by Congress's action in 1981, Mack began using the NCEED to press for a stand-alone African- American museum in D.C. in 1985. Mack did not collaborate with other black-led cultural foundations that were working to improve the representation of African Americans by Smithsonian and other federal institutions. Mack contacted Representative Mickey Leland about his idea for a national museum focusing on African Americans, and won his support for federal legislation in 1985. Leland sponsored a non-binding resolution (H.R. 666) advocating an African-American museum on the National Mall, which passed the House of Representatives in 1986. The congressional attention motivated the Smithsonian to improve its presentation of African-American history. In 1987, the National Museum of American History sponsored a major exhibit, \\"Field to Factory,\\" which focused on the black diaspora out of the Deep South in the 1950s. Rep. Mickey Leland, an early supporter of federal legislation for a black history museum. \\"Field to Factory\\" encouraged Mack to continue pursuing a museum. In 1987 and 1988, NCEED began lining up support among black members of Congress for legislation that would establish an independent African-American national history museum in Washington, D.C. But NCEED ran into opposition from the African American Museum Association (AAMA), an umbrella group that represented small local African-American art, cultural, and history museums across the United States. John Kinard, president of the AAMA and co-founder of the Anacostia Community Museum (which became part of the Smithsonian in 1967), opposed NCEED's effort. Kinard argued that a national museum would consume donor dollars and out-bid local museums for artifacts and trained staff. Kinard and the AAMA instead advocated that Congress establish a $50 million fund to create a national foundation to support local black history museums as a means of mitigating these problems. Others, pointing to the Smithsonian's long history of discrimination against black employees, questioned whether the white-dominated Smithsonian could properly administer an African-American history museum. Lastly, many local African-American museums worried that they would be forced to become adjuncts of the proposed Smithsonian museum. These institutions had fought for decades for political, financial, and academic independence from white-dominated, sometimes racist local governments. Now they feared losing that hard-won independence. In 1988, Rep. John Lewis and Rep. Leland introduced legislation for a stand-alone African-American history museum within the Smithsonian Institution. But the bill faced significant opposition in Congress due to its cost. Supporters of the African-American museum tried to salvage the proposal by suggesting that the Native Indian museum (then moving through Congress) and African-American museum share the same space. But the compromise did not work and the bill died. Rep. John Lewis, who championed the legislation for the museum after Rep. Leland's death in a plane crash in 1989 Lewis and Leland introduced another bill in 1989. Once more, cost considerations killed the bill. The Smithsonian Institution, however, was moving toward support for a museum. In 1988, an ad hoc group of African-American scholars‚Äîmost from within the Smithsonian, but some from other museums as well‚Äîbegan debating what an African-American history museum might look like. While the group discussed the issue informally, Smithsonian Secretary Robert McCormick Adams, Jr. publicly suggested in October 1989 that \\"just a wing\\" of the National Museum of American History should be devoted to black culture, a pronouncement that generated extensive controversy. The discussions by the ad hoc group prompted the Smithsonian to take a more formal approach to the idea of an African-American heritage museum. In December 1989 the Smithsonian hired nationally respected museum administrator Claudine Brown to conduct a formal study of the museum issue. Brown's group reported six months later that the Smithsonian should form a high-level advisory board to conduct a more thorough study of the issue. The Brown study was blunt in its discussion of the divisions within the African-American community about the advisability of a stand-alone national museum of African-American culture and history, but also forceful in its advocacy of a national museum of national prominence and national visibility with a broad mandate to document the vast sweep of the African-American experience in the United States. The study was also highly critical of the Smithsonian's ability to adequately represent African-American culture and history within an existing institution, and its willingness to appoint African-American staff to high-ranking positions within the museum. The Smithsonian formed a 22-member advisory board, chaired by Mary Schmidt Campbell, in May 1990. The creation of the advisory board was an important step for the Smithsonian. There were many on the Smithsonian's Board of Regents who believed that \\"African-American culture and history\\" was indefinable and that not enough artifacts and art of national significance could be found to build a museum. On May 6, 1991, after a year of study, the advisory board issued a report in favor of a national museum, and the Smithsonian Board of Regents voted unanimously to support the idea. However, the proposal the regents adopted only called not for a stand-alone institution but a \\"museum\\" housed in the East Hall of the existing Arts and Industries Building. The regents also agreed to keep the Anacostia Community Museum a separate facility; to give the new museum its own governing board, independent of existing museums; and to support the proposal for a grant-making program to help local African-American museums build their collections and train their staff. The regents also approved a \\"collections identification project\\" to identify donors who might be willing to donate, sell, or loan their items to the proposed new Smithsonian museum. =1990s efforts= The Smithsonian Board of Regents agreed in September 1991 to draft museum legislation, and submitted their bill to Congress in February 1992. The bill was criticized by Tom Mack and others for putting the museum in a building that was too small and old to properly house the intended collection,; and despite winning approval in both House and Senate committees the bill died once more. In 1994, Senator Jesse Helms refused to allow the legislation to come to the Senate floor (voicing both fiscal and philosophical concerns) despite bipartisan support.; ; In 1995, citing funding issues, the Smithsonian abandoned its support for a new museum and instead proposed a new Center for African American History and Culture within organization. The Smithsonian's new Secretary, Ira Michael Heyman, openly questioned the need for \\"ethnic\\" museums on the National Mall. Many, including Mary Campbell Schmidt, saw this as a step backward, a characterization Smithsonian officials strongly disputed. To demonstrate its support for African-American history preservation, the Smithsonian held a fundraiser in March 1998 for the new center which raised $100,000. Heymann left the Smithsonian in January 1999. In the meantime, other cities moved forward with major new African-American museums. The city of Detroit opened a $38.4 million, Museum of African-American History in 1997, and the city of Cincinnati was raising funds for a $90 million, National Underground Railroad Freedom Center (which broke ground in 2002).; In 2000, a private group‚Äîupset with congressional delays‚Äîproposed constructing a $40 million, museum on Poplar Point, a site on the Anacostia River across from the Washington Navy Yard. =Passage of federal legislation= In 2001, Lewis and Representative J. C. Watts re-introduced legislation for a museum in the House of Representatives. Under the leadership of its new Secretary, Lawrence M. Small, the Smithsonian Board of Regents reversed course yet again in June 2001 and agreed to support a stand-alone National Museum of African American History and Culture. The Smithsonian asked Congress to establish a federally funded study commission. Congress swiftly agreed, and on December 29, President George W. Bush signed legislation establishing a 23-member commission to study the need for a museum, how to raise the funds to build and support it, and where it should be located. At the signing ceremony, the president expressed his opinion that the museum should be located on the National Mall. The study commission's work took nearly two years, not the anticipated nine months. In November 2002, in anticipation of a positive outcome, the insurance company AFLAC donated $1 million to help build the museum. On April 3, 2003, the study commission released its final report. As expected, the commission said a museum was needed, and recommended an extremely high-level site: A plot of land adjacent to the Capitol Reflecting Pool, bounded by Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues NW and 1st and 3rd Streets NW. The commission ruled out establishing the museum within the Arts & Industries Building, concluding renovations to the structure would be too costly. It considered a site just west of the National Museum of American History and a site on the southwest Washington waterfront, but rejected both. The commission considered whether the museum should have an independent board of trustees (similar to that of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum) or a board answerable both to the Smithsonian and independent trustees (similar to that of the National Gallery of Art), but rejected these approaches in favor of a board appointed by and answerable only to the Smithsonian Board of Regents. The commission proposed a 350,000 square-foot museum that would cost $360 million to build. Half the construction funds would come from private money, half from the federal government. Legislation to implement the commission's report was sponsored in the Senate by Sam Brownback and in the house by John Lewis. As Congress considered the legislation, the museum's location became the major sticking point. Various members of the public, Congress, and advocacy groups felt the Capitol Hill site was too prominent and made the National Mall look crowded. Alternative proposed sites included the Liberty Loan Federal Building at 401 14th Street SW and Benjamin Banneker Park at the southern end of L'Enfant Promenade. This controversy threatened to kill the legislation. To save the bill, backers of the museum said in mid-November 2003 that they would abandon their push for the Capitol Hill site. The compromise saved the legislation: The House passed the \\"National Museum of African American History and Culture Act\\" () on November 19, and the Senate followed suit two days later. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law on December 16. The legislation appropriated $17 million for museum planning and a site selection process, and $15 million for educational programs. The educational programs included grants to African-American museums to help them improve their operations and collections; grants to African-American museums for internships and fellowships; scholarships for individuals pursuing careers African-American studies; grants to promote the study of modern-day slavery throughout the world; and grants to help African-American museums build their endowments. The legislation established a committee to select a site, and required it to report its recommendation within 12 months. The site selection committee was limited to studying four sites: The site just west of the National Museum of American History, the Liberty Loan Federal Building site, Banneker Park, and the Arts and Industries Building. Siting and design competition Construction signs at the future site of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. Construction site ‚Äì January 20, 2013 On February 8, 2005, with the site selection committee still deliberating, President Bush again endorsed placing the museum on the National Mall. The site selection committee did not issue its recommendation until January 31, 2006‚Äîa full 13 months late. It recommended the site west of the National Museum of American History. The area was part of the Washington Monument grounds, but had been set aside for a museum or other building in the L'Enfant Plan of 1791 and the McMillan Plan of 1902. The United States Department of State originally planned to build its headquarters there in the early 20th century, and the National World War II Memorial Advisory Board had considered the parcel in 1995. On March 15, 2005, the Smithsonian named Dr. Lonnie G. Bunch III to be the Director of the National African American Museum of History and Culture. The National Museum of African American History and Culture Council (the museum's board of trustees) sponsored a competition in 2008 to design a building with three stories below-ground and five stories above-ground. The building was limited to the site chosen by the site selection committee, had to be LEED Gold certified, and had to meet stringent federal security standards. The cost of construction was limited to $500 million ($ in dollars). The competition criteria specified that the winning design had to respect the history and views of the Washington Monument as well as demonstrate an understanding of the African-American experience. The winning design was required to reflect optimism, spirituality, and joy, but also acknowledge and incorporate \\"the dark corners\\" of the African-American experience. The museum design was required to function as a museum, but also be able to host cultural events of various kinds. Hundreds of architects and firms were invited to participate in the design competition. Six firms were chosen as finalists: *Devrouax+Purnell and Pei Cobb Freed & Partners *Diller Scofidio + Renfro, with KlingStubbins *Freelon Adjaye Bond/SmithGroup *Foster and Partners/URS Corporation *Moody Nolan, with Antoine Predock *Moshe Safdie and Associates, with Sulton Campbell Britt & Associates The design submitted by the Freelon Group/Adjaye Associates/Davis Brody Bond won the design competition. The above-ground floors featured an inverted step pyramid surrounded by a bronze architectural scrim, which reflected a crown used in Yoruba culture. Under federal law, the National Capital Planning Commission, the United States Commission of Fine Arts, and the D.C. Historic Preservation Commission all have review and approval rights over construction in the metropolitan D.C. area. As the design went through these agencies for approval, it was slightly revised. The building was moved toward the southern boundary of its plot of land, to give a better view of the Washington Monument from Constitution Avenue. The size of the upper floors were shrunk by 17 percent. Although three upper floors were permitted (instead of just two), the ceiling height of each floor was lowered so that the overall height of the building was lowered. The large, box-like first floor was largely eliminated. Added to the entrance on Constitution Avenue were a pond, garden, and bridge, so that visitors would have to \\"cross over the water\\" like slaves did when they came to America. The Smithsonian estimated in February 2012 that museum would to open in 2015. Until then, the museum would occupy a gallery on the second floor of the National Museum of American History. On June 10, 2013, media magnate Oprah Winfrey donated $12 million to the NMAAHC. This was in addition to the $1 million she donated to the museum in 2007. The Smithsonian said it would name the NMAAHC's 350-seat theater after her. The GM Foundation announced a $1 million to the museum on January 22, 2014, to fund construction of the building and design and install permanent exhibits. =Building design changes= The facade's 'scrim' viewed from the entrance lobby. The design of the architectural scrim which surrounds the building was changed in September 2012. The proposed building itself was a box-like structure. The three-part corona of the building's design was created by a structure only minimally attached to the building. The exterior of this structure, whose frames lean outward to create the corona, consisted of a thin screen or \\"scrim\\" perforated by geometrical patterns based on historic iron grilles found in African- American communities in Charleston, South Carolina, and New Orleans, Louisiana. The original design proposed that the scrim be made of bronze, which would have made the museum the only one on the National Mall whose exterior was not made of limestone or marble. Cost issues forced the architects to change this to bronze-painted aluminum in September 2012. The change was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts, but the commissioners criticized the change for lacking the warm, reflective qualities of bronze. Noted architect Witold Rybczynski also criticized the change: \\"The appeal of bronze is its warm golden sheen and the rich patina that it acquires over time, but uniformly painted surfaces lack these attributes, and over time they don't age, they merely flake. ... At the time of this writing, the African American museum risks compromising its original intention. In architecture, beauty sometimes really is only skin-deep.\\" The Smithsonian then radically changed the landscaping of the under-construction museum in summer 2013. The original design for the museum planned a wetland with flowing creek, bridges, and native plants in this area. But cost considerations led the agency to completely eliminate it. At first, the Smithsonian proposed a low hedge. It brought this design to the Commission of Fine Arts in April 2013, which rejected it. The Commission expressed \\"great concern about the possible loss of the symbolic meaning that had been skillfully woven into the design of both the landscape and the building\\". In July, the Smithsonian replaced the hedge with a low dull black granite wall. The Commission of Fine Arts approved that redesign, and the Smithsonian brought it to the National Capital Planning Commission. As of August 2013, the NCPC was anticipated to approve it. Debate over the corona's finish continued into 2014 before being resolved. The Commission of Fine Arts repeatedly urged the architects to use bronze for the scrim, as it created a \\"shimmering, lustrous effect under many lighting conditions\\" and \\"conveyed dignity, permanence and beauty\\". Duranar paint was the first substitute proposed by the architects, but the commission members rejected it, noting that it had a \\"putty-like appearance under overcast conditions\\" and visually fell \\"far short of the beautiful poetic intention promised by the concept design\\". A second finish, the sprayable metal LuminOre, was rejected by the commission because it was difficult to produce in the high quality needed, and was prone to flaking and discoloration. Electroless plating and anodized aluminum were rejected because they lacked durability. A physical vapor deposition process involving a nickel-chrome plating was dismissed for not achieving the right color, luster, or warmth. In early 2014, tests were made with polyvinyl difluoride (PVDF). This coating was approved by the Commission of Fine Arts on February 20, 2014, and by the National Capital Planning Commission in April 2014. =Construction of the museum building= The museum under construction in May 2014. NMAAHC Monumental Stair The museum's groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 22, 2012. President Barack Obama and museum director Bunch were among the speakers at the ceremony. Actress Phylicia RashƒÅd was the Master of Ceremonies for the event, which also featured poetry and music performed by Denyce Graves, Thomas Hampson, and the Heritage Signature Chorale. Clark Construction Group, Smoot Construction, and H.J. Russell & Company won the contract to build the museum. The architectural firm of McKissack & McKissack (which was the first African American-owned architectural firm in the United States) provided project management services on behalf of the Smithsonian, and acted as liaison between the Smithsonian and public utilities and D.C. government agencies. Guy Nordenson and Associates and Robert Silman Associates were the structural engineers for the project. Construction in September 2015 The NAAMHC became the deepest museum on the National Mall. Excavators dug below grade to lay the foundations, although the building itself will be only deep. The museum is located at a low point on the Mall, and groundwater puts on the walls. To compensate, per minute of water were pumped out every day during construction of the foundation and below-grade walls, and a slurry of cement and sand injected into forms to stabilize the site. Lasers continually monitored the walls during construction for any signs of bulging or movement. The first concrete for the foundations was poured in November 2012. As the lower levels were completed, cranes installed a segregated railroad passenger car and a guard tower from the Louisiana State Penitentiary on November 17, 2013. These items were so large that they could not be dismantled and installed at a later date. Instead, the museum had to be built around them. By late December 2013, construction was just weeks from finishing the five basement levels, and above-ground work was scheduled to begin in late January 2014. At that time, the Smithsonian estimated the museum would be finished in November 2015. Guy Nordenson and Associates were the engineers for the superstructure of the museum building and long-span porch. Robert Silman Associates oversaw the engineering of the below-grade structure and exhibit structural support. The steel was fabricated by SteelFab, Inc. While the below-grade floors were made of reinforced concrete, with columns supporting each floor above, the above-grade floors were primarily exhibit space and needed to be kept column-free. To support the upper floors, four massive walls, consisting of steel frames and cast-in-place concrete infill, were constructed. Design and fabrication of the steel members of the above-ground structure required extreme precision, as the steel elements penetrated one another at more than 500 places and some beams had several hundred bolt-holes in them. All structural steel elements also had to work almost perfectly with the rebar and rebar couplers so that elements would not run into one another and yet maintain structural integrity. A system of girders around the fifth above-ground floor supported the corona. Some of these girders were so complex they required more than 180 parts. The long-span porch that covers the main entrance was built of long plate girders and box columns (also made of plate). A long steel camber beam at the midpoint helps support the porch roof. An elliptical monumental staircase runs continually between the above-ground floors. This staircase has no intermediate supports, and weighs in at more than . SteelFab fabricated more than of structural steel for the museum in conjunction with AIW, Inc. who fabricated the architecturally exposed, and ornamental steel and bronze metal work. SteelFab received an award from the Washington Building Congress for its work. ArchDaily has reported that the museum was named the winner for the architecture category and the overall winner for the Beazley Design of the Year award for 2017. According to the award criteria set by the Design Museum in London, the NMAAHC is \\"further solidified as promoting or delivering change, enabling access, extending design practice, or capturing the spirit of the year.\\" Ozwald Boateng OBE, a jury member, made a statement expressing his thoughts on the NMAAHC: \\"We couldn't look any further than the Smithsonian for the overall award. It is a project of beautiful design, massive cultural impact, delivers an emotional experience, and has a scale deserve of this major award.\\" Topping out of the museum occurred in October 2014. That same month, the Smithsonian announced that the National Museum of African American History and Culture had received $162 million in donations toward the $250 million cost of constructing its building. To bolster the fundraising, the Smithsonian said it would contribute a portion of its $1.5 billion capital campaign to help complete the structure. The entire steel superstructure and all above-ground concrete pouring was complete in January 2015. Glass for the windows and curtain walls began to be placed that same month, with glass enclosure of the building complete on April 14, 2015. That same day, the first of the structure's 3,600 bronze-colored panels for the building's corona were installed. A worker was severely injured at the construction site on June 3, 2015, when scaffolding on the roof collapsed on top of him. 35-year-old Ivan Smyntyna was rushed to a local hospital, where he later died. The building has a total of 10 stories (five above and five below ground). =Opening= In January 2016, the Smithsonian set an opening day of September 24, 2016, for the museum's opening. President Barack Obama would dedicate the museum, which would be followed by a week of special events. The museum would open for extended hours during that week to accommodate crowds and visitors. NMAAHC officials said that construction scaffolding around the exterior of the building should come down in April 2016, at which time some of the more dust-and-humidity resistant artifacts and displays could be installed. Installation of more delicate items would wait until the building's environmental controls had stabilized the interior humidity and removed most of the dust from the air. The museum identified 3,000 items in its collections which would form 11 initial exhibits. More than 130 video and audio installations would be installed as part of these exhibits. In January 2016, the museum announced the receipt of a $10 million gift from David Rubenstein, CEO of The Carlyle Group and a Smithsonian regent, as well as a $1 million donation from Wells Fargo. As of January 30, 2016, the museum still needed to raise $40 million toward its $270 million construction goal. Two unique documents, both signed by President Abraham Lincoln, would be loaned to the museum for its opening. These are commemorative copies of the 13th Amendment and the Emancipation Proclamation, of which only a limited number were printed. Few of these have survived. David Rubenstein purchased both items in 2012. In late March 2016, Microsoft announced a $1 million donation to the museum. On March 27, the museum drew criticism for agreeing to include a small number of items from the career of actor Bill Cosby in a planned exhibit about African Americans in the entertainment industry. Women who have accused Cosby of sexual assault objected to the display.; In response to the resulting controversy, the museum added the following sentence to its description of Cosby's career: \\"In recent years, revelations about alleged sexual misconduct have cast a shadow over Cosby's entertainment career and severely damaged his reputation.\\" Google donated $1 million to the museum in early September 2016. The technology firm had previously worked with the NMAAHC to create a 3D interactive exhibit which allows visitors to see artifacts in a close-up, 360-degree view using their mobile phone. The 3D exhibit was created by designers and engineers from the Black Googler Network.; On September 23, 2016, The Washington Post reported that Robert F. Smith, the founder, chairman, and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, had given $20 million to the NMAAHC. The gift was second-largest in the museum's history, exceeded only by the $21 million donated by Oprah Winfrey. Ava DuVernay was commissioned by the museum to create a film which debuted at the museum's opening on September 24, 2016. This film, August 28: A Day in the Life of a People (2016), tells of six significant events in African-American history that happened on the same date, August 28. The 22-minute film stars Lupita Nyong'o, Don Cheadle, Regina King, David Oyelowo, Angela Bassett, Michael Ealy, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Andr√© Holland and Glynn Turman. Events depicted include William IV's royal assent to the UK Slavery Abolition Act in 1833, the 1955 lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi, the release of Motown's first number-one song, ‚ÄúPlease Mr. Postman‚Äù by The Marvellettes, Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 1963 \\"I Have a Dream\\" speech, the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the night then-senator Barack Obama accepted the Democratic nomination for president at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. On September 24, 2016, President Barack Obama formally opened the new museum along with four generations of the Bonner family, from 99-year-old Ruth Bonner to Ruth's great-granddaughter Christine. Together with the Obamas, Ruth and her family rang the Freedom Bell (rather than cut a ribbon) to officially open the museum. The bell came from the first Baptist church organized by and for African Americans, founded in 1776 in Williamsburg, Virginia, where at the time it was unlawful for blacks to congregate or preach. During his speech at the museum's opening, Obama shed tears discussing his thoughts on visiting the museum with future grandchildren. The total cost of the museum's design, construction, and installation of exhibits was $540 million ($ in dollars).; By the time the museum's founding fundraising campaign had ended, the NMAAHC had raised $386 million ($ in dollars), 143 percent more than its goal of $270 million. Attendance and timed-entry ticketing More than 600,000 people visited the museum in its first three months. The Smithsonian required all visitors to have a ticket to access the museum. At first, the organization used pre-purchased timed-entry tickets, combined with a limited number of same-day tickets released every morning. The timed-entry tickets allowed visitors to enter at a specific time of day, with a shorter wait in line than would be expected if everyone showed up at the same time. Patron traffic proved so heavy that the NMAAHC began offering many fewer same-day tickets, and changed their release from early morning to early afternoon. As of mid- December 2016, the pre-purchased tickets were sold out through the end of March 2017. After six months, 1.2 million people had visited the NMAAHC, making it one of the four most-visited Smithsonian museums. Patrons spent an average of six hours at the museum; twice as long as had been estimated before the museum's opening. The museum's popularity led to some problems. Visitors stood in line in the museum foyer to take an elevator down to the underground level. The exhibits start with the Middle Passage and slavery where the hallway is intentionally designed to be cramped and somewhat claustrophobic. The large number of visitors who stop to read the exhibit's signs caused dangerous overcrowding. Museum officials began to limit the number of people who could take the elevator (and thus enter the exhibit) to mitigate this problem, although this led to still longer lines in the foyer. Smithsonian officials announced that the museum had 3 million visitors in its first full year of operation. An average of 8,000 people a day attended the museum, double the number anticipated. The museum has become an \\"essential stop\\" for tourists, and patrons are diverse and international (not just African American and domestic). The heavy attendance is causing significant strain and wear and tear on the museum. The museum reassessed the use of timed-entry passes in October 2017, and suspended the use of timed-entry ticketing on weekdays in September 2018. Overwhelming demand for entry led the museum to reinstitute the timed-entry ticketing policy for weekdays in October 2018. By the end of 2018, the museum had received just under 5 million visitors since it opened, 1.9 million of whom visited in 2018. It was the organization's sixth most- visited museum, behind the National Portrait Gallery (2.3 million) and ahead of the National Zoo (1.8 million). Beginning January 1, 2019, the NMAAHC implemented a new entry policy. From September 1 to February 28, no timed- entry tickets would be required on weekdays, although they still were needed on weekends. The rest of the year, which is the height of the tourist season, timed-entry tickets will be required all days of the week for entry before 1 PM. Visitors seeking entry after 1 PM will not need a timed-entry ticket. Collection and exhibits Statue of Benjamin Banneker =Web presence= In 2007, the NMAAHC became the first major museum to open on the Web before completing a physical structure. The web site included the museum's first exhibit, mounted in New York City. The site was also designed to encourage collaboration between scholars and the public. The main feature of the web- based initiative was the Memory Book application, which allowed individuals to contribute to the web site pictures, a story, or an audio application to spotlight unique experiences in African-American culture. =Pre-opening exhibits= In January 2012, the National Museum of African American History and Culture and the National Museum of American History partnered with the Thomas Jefferson Foundation (which owns Jefferson's home, Monticello) to create a major new exhibit, \\"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello: Paradox of Liberty.\\" The exhibition opened on January 12, 2012, at the National Museum of American History, and closed on October 14, 2012. The exhibit received nationwide attention, garnering articles from sources such as the Associated Press, Huffington Post, National Public Radio, the New York Times, United Press International, USA Today, and the Washington Post.; ; ; The exhibit was created by Rex Ellis (an associate director of the NMAAHC) and Elizabeth Chew (a curator at Monticello). It was accompanied by a companion book, 'Those Who Labor for My Happiness': Slavery at Thomas Jefferson's Monticello, by Lucia Stanton. NMAAHC director Lonnie Bunch III said that the exhibit explored one way in which slavery might be presented at the National Museum of African American History and Culture when it opens in 2015. \\"Slavery at Jefferson's Monticello\\" also received attention for the striking statue of Jefferson that graced the exhibit entrance. The Smithsonian used a Minolta 3D scanner to create a digital image of a life-size bronze statue of Jefferson which is located at Monticello. RedEye on Demand (a subsidiary of Stratasys) used a fused deposition modeling printer, which laid down tiny layers of molten plastic to slowly build the statue. The statue was \\"printed\\" in four sections, which were then put together, detailed, and painted.; Smithsonian officials were so pleased with the process that they began laying plans use it to laser image and 3D print a vast number of items in their collection, which they could then share inexpensively with the rest of the world. Other pre-opening exhibitions include Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing: The Apollo Theater and American Entertainment (2010), For All the World to See: Visual Culture and the Struggle for Civil Rights (2010), The Scurlock Studio and Black Washington: Picturing The Promise (2009), and Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits (2007). =Notable items in the collection= The Smithsonian Institution listed the number of items in the museum collection in 2012 as either more than 18,000 pieces or more than 25,000 pieces. CBS News reported in May 2015 that the collection size had grown to 33,000 objects, although this had risen to more than 40,000 objects by May 2019. About 3,500 items are on display to the public. Items obtained by the museum initially were received, conserved, and stored at the Smithsonian Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland. Dozens of permanent curatorial staff and temporary contractors accessed the items, repaired them, and conserved them in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment. Ren√©e Anderson, the NMAAHC's head of collections, oversaw the effort. After artifacts were selected for display, graphics and labels for each item were manufactured. Display cases for each item were also purchased, and exhibiting mounts or specially designed cases handcrafted for particularly fragile, important, or unusually sized objects. Museum officials said all artifacts and displays will be moved into the new museum in the summer of 2016, along with the museum's 175 full-time employees. In November 2016, NBA player LeBron James donated $2.5 million to support the museum's exhibit on the accomplishments of boxer Muhammad Ali. As of September 2016, notable items in the collection included: Pre-20th century *Several items from the S√£o Jos√© Paquete Africa, a sunken slave ship excavated off the coast of South Africa in 2015. The wreck is owned by Iziko Museums of South Africa, and items will be on long-term loan to the NMAAHC.; (Finding a sunken slave ship, raising it, and displaying it at the museum has long been a dream of museum director Lonnie Bunch.) *Items owned by Harriet Tubman, including eating utensils, a hymnal, and a linen and silk shawl given to her by Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. Related items include a photographic portrait of Tubman (one of only a few known to exist), and three postcards with images of Tubman's 1913 funeral.alt=image of ashley's sack, a cloth feedsack that has been embroidered.thumbAshley's Sack is among the 37,000 objects at the Smithsonian related to African American community, family, the visual and performing arts, religion, civil rights, slavery, and segregation. *Ashley's Sack, a mid-1800s hand-embroidered feedsack gifted from a slave mother, Rose, to her nine-year-old daughter, Ashley, when Ashley was sold away. *A badge from 1850, worn by an African American in Charleston, South Carolina, indicating the wearer was a slave. *Feet and wrist manacles from the American Deep South used prior to 1860. *Garments worn by African- American slaves. *An 1874 home from Poolesville, Maryland. The dwelling was constructed by the Jones family, who were freed slaves. The Joneses later founded an all-black community nearby. *A Bible owned by Nat Turner, who led a slave rebellion in Virginia in 1831. *A letter by Toussaint L'Ouverture, leader of the Haitian Revolution slave revolt in 1791. *A money box used by Richard Allen, founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church. *Historic items from black Catholic communities, including the St. Augustine Church and Sisters of the Holy Family in New Orleans. 20th and 21st centuries ‚ÄòWhites Only‚Äô ‚Äì Men‚Äôs restroom and smoking lounge in Southern Railway Company Coach No. 1200, 1923, redesigned as a segregated car in 1940 *A railroad car from Chattanooga, Tennessee, used by African-American passengers during the Jim Crow era. Pete Claussen and Gulf & Ohio Railways (the company he founded in 1985) donated more than $222,000 to restore the car, which was built by the Pullman Company in 1922. *The desk of Robert Sengstacke Abbott, editor-in- chief of the Chicago Defender, an African American newspaper founded in 1905. *A segregated drinking fountain from the Jim Crow era with the sign \\"colored\\" (indicating it was for use by blacks only). *Dresses and other garments by fashion designer Ann Lowe. Lowe designed clothing for the Du Pont family, Roosevelt family, and the Rockefeller family. She also designed items for wealthy etiquette expert and socialite Emily Post and her family, and created Jacqueline Bouvier's wedding dress for her 1953 marriage to John F. Kennedy. *A recreation of part of \\"Mae's Millinery Shop,\\" the hat shop begun by Mae Reeves in 1942, one of the first businesses in Philadelphia owned by an African-American woman. *The Purple Heart and footlocker owned by James L. McCullin, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen. *A PT-13D Stearman biplane trainer aircraft operated by the United States Army Air Forces and used in 1944 for training members of the Tuskegee Airmen. *A sign from a bus in Nashville, Tennessee, from the Jim Crow era which indicates which seating is for blacks only. *A guard tower and cell from the Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) known for much of the 20th century as a cruel, violence-prone, squalid prison where African American inmates were treated worse than slaves. NMAAHC curator Paul Gardullo said the items document how attitudes about slavery were carried over into the post-slavery prison system in the Deep South. Museum Director Lonnie Bunch acknowledged scholars' worries that the items were controversial, but said the museum's mission is to tell stories through the African-American experience. The high guard tower will be part of an exhibit on segregation, while the prison cell will be in a separate exhibit on places. Both items are from Camp A, the oldest section of the prison. The cell was constructed atop slave quarters. *Allan Rohan Crite's painting Stations of the Cross (1947) *David Driskell's Behold Thy Son (1956) *The glass-topped casket originally used to display and bury the body of 14-year-old Emmett Till, the victim of racially motivated torture and murder in Mississippi. Till's death served as a catalyst for the Civil Rights Movement. *The dress which Rosa Parks was sewing the day she refused to give up her seat to a white man on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on December 1, 1955. Parks' action sparked the Montgomery bus boycott, and her action was one of the first incidents of civil disobedience in the Civil Rights Movement. *A Selmer trumpet owned by jazz musician Louis Armstrong. *Muhammad Ali's boxing gloves. Boxing headgear worn by Cassius Clay (later to be known as Muhammad Ali). *A dress owned by actress and singer Pearl Bailey. *A cape and jumpsuit owned by American soul singer James Brown. *The Moog synthesizer and MPC beat machine used by hip-hop producer J Dilla. *A chef's jacket worn by Leah Chase, the New Orleans-based chef known as the Queen of Creole Cuisine. *The \\"Mothership\\", a aluminum and acrylic glass prop created by funk music singer George Clinton and used during performances of his bands Parliament and Funkadelic. Clinton's original \\"Mothership\\" was scrapped in 1983; this replica was crafted by Clinton in the mid-1990s and used for about five years. *A collection of costumes designed by director and costume designer Geoffrey Holder for his 1976 musical, The Wiz (an adaptation of the L. Frank Baum novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz). The costumes won the Tony Award for Best Costume Design, the play won the Tony Award for Best Musical, and Holder won the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical. *A cherry red Cadillac convertible owned by rock and roll singer Chuck Berry. *An amplifier, speakers, and turntables used by Tony Crush a.k.a. DJ Tony Tone of the Cold Crush Brothers. *Several paintings and pieces of terracotta sculpture from the Barnett-Aden Collection, donated by BET founder Robert L. Johnson. *Gymnastic equipment used by artistic gymnastics champion Gabby Douglas at the 2012 Summer Olympics. Douglas was the first African American, and first non- Caucasian of any nationality, to win the women's artistic individual all- around gold medal. She was also the first American gymnast ever to win both the team and individual all-around gold at the same Olympics. *The handcuffs used by police in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to arrest African-American Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., in 2009. *Hip Hop Smithsonian, a collection of photographs of hip hop artists collected by Bill Adler. *President Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign office from Falls Church, Virginia. *A King Super 20 alto saxophone custom-made for saxophonist Charlie Parker in 1947, which he played from 1947 until his death in 1955. Leadership Lonnie Bunch III was the museum's founding director being appointed in 2005, overseeing collections, traveling exhibitions as well as planning and building. On May 28, 2019, Bunch was elected Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He became the Smithsonian's first African American leader. The interim director of NMAAHC was history professor Spencer Crew. Kevin Young was appointed director in September 2020. Restaurant Sweet Home Caf√© is a 400-seat, luncheon-only restaurant located inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture. Jerome Grant is the executive chef, and the restaurant is managed by Restaurant Associates in association with Thompson Hospitality. Joanne Hyppolite, NMAAHC curator for cultural expressions, oversees the restaurant as well as the museum's exhibits on foodways and cuisine. The cafeteria opened on September 24, 2016. It was named a 2017 semifinalist by the James Beard Award for Best New Restaurant. The restaurant features four food stations, where main and side dishes, desserts, and beverages important to the African American experience or developed by African Americans may be purchased. These include the Agricultural South station, the Creole Coast station, the North States, and the Western Range. Each station offers several vegetarian entrees in addition to meat dishes. When designing the museum, the Smithsonian utilized its experience with Mitsitam Caf√© at the National Museum of the American Indian. That cafeteria had been established to familiarize museum-goers with the rich food heritage of indigenous peoples of the Americas. Mitsitam Caf√© not only proved popular and won culinary awards, but made a substantial amount of profit. The idea of regional food stations came from Dr. Jessica B. Harris, a food scholar who researched the food of African Americans from the colonial era to the present and presented her research to the museum's scholarly committee in 2013. Albert Lukas, a supervising chef at Sweet Home Caf√©, traveled the United States for two years to find recipes and interview home cooks and professional chefs. A committee of chefs, curators, and historians spent another two years working out the restaurant's concept, visual design, and menu (the latter of which was designed by executive chef Grant). The final menu was designed not only to showcase the kinds of food African Americans of different regions ate at different times in American history, but also to demonstrate the impact African Americans had on both home cooking and haute cuisine. Chef Carla Hall, co-host of the television show The Chew, was named a \\"culinary ambassador\\" for the restaurant. She engages in public outreach for the restaurant and museum. Reception In a review for The New York Times, art critic Holland Cotter wrote, \\"The extremely complex narrative, with uplift and tragedy seemingly on a fixed collision course, spreads over five floors of galleries\\", and that it \\"holds some of the oldest and most disturbing material.\\" Cotter added that \\"It's great that the museum mixes everything together: It means you can't just select a comfortable version of history.\\" He concluded, \\"[I] hope, actually ‚Äî that the museum will never be finished, or consider itself so; that its take on African-American history, which is American history, stays fluid, critical and richly confused: real, in other words.\\" The Wall Street Journal's critic at large, Edward Rothstein, suggested that \\"even a full day's visit is insufficient for a careful survey. That alone is an imposing achievement\\". Rothstein wrote that the \\"museum is illuminating, disturbing, moving‚Äîand flawed\\". He wrote that we \\"see the evolution of African-American newspapers, businesses, churches and other institutions. Galleries devoted to music and sports make it plain how much African-American history and culture is simply American history and culture.\\" He also wrote that there is a \\"reluctance, too, to cast doubt on one perspective or another, or to give a nuanced assessment of conflicts. The actual doctrines of Elijah Muhammad, a leader of the Nation of Islam and mentor to Malcolm X, are unmentioned. And, more troubling, the Black Panthers are characterized as if they were defensively armed social workers, a PC view of radicalism that recurs in other contexts.\\". Museum reviewer Diana Muir, while criticizing the Museum for repeatedly misleading visitors by failing to put facts in \\"comparative perspective\\" a deficiency that \\"misleads curators into making sweeping claims like the assertion in the introductory room that before 1400 \\"slavery was a temporary status,\\" nevertheless concluded that \\"Taken as a whole, however, the NMAAHC shows that it is possible to do an identity museum well, to build a museum on a foundation of rigorous scholarship that can inform, excite, and even inspire.\\" The Contemplative Court The lack of material on Justice Clarence Thomas drew criticism; ; ; ; ; and prompted the introduction of a resolution by six GOP senators which argued that Thomas should have a \\"prominent place\\" in the museum. In a response to a question posed to the Smithsonian by the politically conservative news and commentary website CNSNews.com which asked why Thomas was not included in the museum, a spokeswoman for the consortium said that while Thomas was an example of an African-American with a \\"compelling personal stories,\\" the museum \\"cannot tell every story in our inaugural exhibitions.\\" Los Angeles Times architecture critic Christopher Hawthorne wrote that the museum is the \\"most impressive and ambitious public building to go up in Washington in a generation\\" and that despite \\"some flaws and unfortunate signs of cost-cutting, the design succeeds almost precisely to the degree that it is enigmatic and even fickle, spanning huge gulfs in the national character without being naive enough to try to close them. The building embraces memory and aspiration, protest and reconciliation, pride and shame.\\" In The Plain Dealer, Susan Glaser wrote that the museum \\"is really two museums in one: Its historical exhibits encompasses about 60 percent of the gallery space, while cultural exhibits take up the other 40 percent.\\" She wrote that the museum is \\"filled with difficult truths\\", such as a \\"statue of Thomas Jefferson, author of the words 'All Men Are Created Equal,' who is depicted in front of a brick wall ‚Äì and on every brick, the name of one of his 609 slaves, including at least six who were his own children.\\" But she wrote that \\"[i]t was the coffin of Emmett Till that finally got to me.\\" She describes 14-year-old Till, who was lynched for allegedly whistling at a white woman: \\"Though his body was severely disfigured, his mother insisted on an open casket at his funeral, hoping to show the world the effects of racial injustice. It helped ignite the civil rights movement.\\" Because of its lengthy name and the unpronounceable acronym NMAAHC derived from it, a few journalists, following the trend established on social media, used the nickname \\"the Blacksonian\\" for the museum, based on its content and its relationship to the Smithsonian. The Washington Post architectural critic Philip Kennicott assessed the museum as its one-year anniversary, concluding that the NMAAHC has \\"changed the center of gravity on the Mall\\" and created \\"energy along 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW that feels new, and welcome\\". Generally effusive in his praise, Kennicott found the museum to have an \\"allusive and mediated\\" feel, as opposed to the traditional \\"magisterial and transparent\\" aesthetic of most museums. He singled out the way the cornona cast shadows in the interior, the dramatic way the corona framed nearby monuments and memorials, and the museum's art gallery. Kennicott was unhappy with \\"the jumble of elevations throughout the history galleries\\". The problem particularly affected the Contemplative Court (where corrosion was also affecting the ceiling less than a year later). Museum designers correctly concluded that the cramped entrance to the underground galleries would create a powerful and negative emotional reaction, he said, but the side-effect has been to create a \\"fundamental flaw\\" in the museum by creating a terrific bottleneck in visitor traffic. A 2018 exhibition review in the Chicago Tribune noted the museum is practically ‚Äî and unexpectedly to the museum's planners ‚Äî \\"one of the toughest tickets to get in American culture\\" and posited that this was \\"proof that the nation wanted desperately to grapple with some of the thorniest questions about the people it brought here by force\\".  Controversies  In mid-July 2020, the museum removed a controversial chart from their website that was entitled \\"Aspects and Assumptions of Whiteness & White Culture in the United States\\" and had been put up on March 31. Some examples that were claimed to be part of white culture were: objectivity; rational, linear thinking; emphasis on the scientific method; hard work being the key to success; delayed gratification; the nuclear family ‚Äî father, mother, 2.3 children is the ideal social unit; self-reliance and being polite. After criticism, museum officials removed the chart explaining that it did not contribute to the discussion as planned and apologized.

The station is owned by Pamal Broadcasting and broadcasts at 6 kilowatts ERP from a location near the boundary of Colonie and Schenectady adjacent to the station's former studios (which are now vacant as of November 2010). History The 100.9 frequency signed on in 1972 as WWOM (Wonderful World of Music), an easy listening station going against up WROW-FM and WHRL. With two somewhat established rivals, the station quickly left the format and went through a variation of formats, including several variants of adult contemporary (mid-1970s and again starting in 1980), soft rock (1977‚Äì78), and then album- oriented rock, briefly in late 1978/early 1979, identifying itself as \\"WWOM- Albany NY's Best Rock\\" in its legal ID, putting it into direct competition with WQBK-FM. The station then abruptly flipped to disco early in the spring of 1979, and then to Soft AC in the summer of 1980. During this period, the station struggled in both ratings and revenue. In 1984, local businessman William Sellwood bought WWOM as a companion to WABY (then on 1400 AM). Two years later, Sellwood relaunched the station as \\"K-Lite 101\\" with the WKLI calls coming into use. With no FM competition for adult contemporary music, the station quickly became a success and spent several years in the Top 5 stations (12+) in the market with many books as the No. 1 in some demographics and time periods, a rarity for a lower powered signal in the Albany market. In 1990, Paul Bendat purchased the station. After WROW-FM flipped to WYJB in early 1994, WKLI's ratings underwent a decline as listeners flocked to the far stronger signal of WYJB. On January 12, 1996, WKBE joined WKLI in a simulcast of \\"K-Lite\\" (without the '101' brand); however, the format ended just over two months later when WKLI and WKBE in Warrensburg, New York joined together and flipped to a Top 40/CHR genre as \\"K-100\\" at 3 p.m. on March 18.http://formatchange.com/1009-wkli1003-wkbe-become-k100/ With the flip, the station became one of the charter affiliates of the syndication attempt of the Scott and Todd show from WPLJ in New York City which the station played as a homecoming of sorts for Todd Pettengill (an alum of rival WFLY). Though K-100 stayed competitive with WFLY and WRVE, changes in the format and the end of syndication of Scott & Todd in October 1998 marked a quick decline for the station which, by the end of 1998, was seeing ratings not seen in 3 decades.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1998/RR-1998-10-02.pdf In February 1999, Paul Bendat sold his stations to Tele-Media, Inc., which relaunched the \\"K-100\\" format three months later as modern adult contemporary \\"The Point\\" gaining the new calls of WCPT; the WKLI calls and the old \\"K-Lite\\" name moved down to 94.5 FM (now WYKV). The station struggled to find an audience over the next two years amid staff and management changes as well as corporate problems on Tele-Media's end. Tele- Media sold WCPT and WKBE to Pamal Broadcasting in August 2001 with the sale closing in late October. While WKBE kept a modified version of the \\"Point\\" format which remains to this day, WCPT became adult standards/soft adult contemporary under the \\"Magic\\" name with the WKLI calls returning soon thereafter. Under this format, the station was always one of the top rated stations in the Albany market. As Magic, the station would play Christmas music from mid-November to Christmas Day each year (starting in 2005 and until 2009, the last Christmas season under the format). Pamal announced on February 8, 2010 that \\"Magic\\" would move to sister station WROW, with WKLI-FM adopting a new format after a brief simulcast period. After two weeks of simulcasting WROW, and a brief stunt with Christmas music and country, the station flipped to a variety hits format as 100.9 The Bridge on February 24, 2010, with \\"Under the Bridge\\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers being the first (and final) song of the format. However, the variety hits format failed to compete with dominant WRVE and would also take ratings away from sister WYJB, and the station saw its lowest ratings in over a decade. After 18 months under the Bridge format, WKLI-FM would return to a rock format for the first time since 1979 with a flip to active rock at noon on September 2, 2011 with \\"Wicked Garden\\" by Stone Temple Pilots being the first song played, putting the station in competition with WQBK-FM once again and, to a lesser extent, WPYX.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/netgnomes/53240/the-bridge-to-rock-in- albany/ By late 2013, the station had gone for more of a classic rock format in order to compete with dominant classic rock station WPYX. At Noon on October 10, 2013, WKLI changed their format to country, branded as \\"The Cat\\", simulcasting sister station WZMR until December 13, when WZMR began stunting with sound effects of a man hiking until Midnight on December 14, 2013, when it flipped to AAA as \\"104.9 the Peak\\".http://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/85351/104-9-the-cat-albany-on- the-move/ In 2018, with the demise of sister station WINU's sports format, 100.9 The Cat and sister station WROW 590 added play-by-play of the New York Mets and New England Patriots. WKLI played Patriots games during conflicts with Mets baseball on WROW (which were slated to move to WKLI only starting 2019, however this did not take place due to Mets radio network realignments). The Patriots also left WKLI after the 2018 season, leaving the Albany metro area without Patriots radio broadcasts.

Liberals and Conservatives (who were in the Spanish government) went against central party policy, and the Traditionalists remembered his defense of autonomy with weapons. Francesc Maci√† -speaking as a supporter of independence- said that this was a short Statute, but the best one that could be achieved. Finally, Largo Caballero, speaking as a Socialist, stated that Spanish workers believed that Catalan Autonomy was the first step in the regeneration of Spain. On 26 January, this Statute was ratified in an Assembly held at the Palau de la M√∫sica of Barcelona, which gathered all the municipal representatives together. 1,046 of 1,072 towns voted positively, as well as 2,076,251 of the 2,099,218 eligible citizens.

This project was sent to the Spanish Government for its approval on 28 January 1919 with several Catalan deputies to defend it, but the Socio-political situation, which changed quickly due to several strikes in the Catalan field, first, the collision between Government of Catalonia's interests and the Spanish government's ones, secondly, and, finally, the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera stopped its progression.Surrealism and the Spanish Civil War, Robin Ad√®le Greeley, p22 The structure of the text The structure of the Autonomy Statute of Catalonia, as the previously list made by Woodrow Wilson in the ‚ÄúFourteen Points‚Äù, was approved by the Assembly of the Commonwealth is as follows: *Preliminar declaration *First title: About the land of Catalonia.

Publication history  Savage Species was written by David Eckelberry, Rich Redman, and Jennifer Clarke Wilkes, and was published in 2003. Cover art was by Jeff Easley, with interior art by Dennis Cramer, Brian Despain, Emily Fiegenschuh, Jeremy Jarvis, John and Laura Lakey, Alan Pollack, Vinod Rams, Wayne Reynolds, David Roach, Scott Roller, Mark Sasso, Arnie Swekel and Sam Wood. Wilkes proposed the project in 2000, \\"after a closing seminar at Gen Con in which a number of players suggested a supplement book about playing monsters as characters\\". The project was approved in early 2001 and the designers started writing in the fall of 2001. Savage Species began as a guide to playing monsters as PCs but, during the design process, became a book to assist Dungeon Masters in creating monster non-player characters as well.  Reception  The reviewer from Pyramid commented: \\"Savage Species opens up new avenues of play by allowing nearly any creature in the MM to be used as a player character race. The heart of the system presented in the book is rules to determine the effective character level any given monster.\\" The reviewer add that the system is \\"simple and straightforward, and the rules include several examples\\". Shannon Appelcline identified Savage Species as one of several one-off books to support the 3.0 edition of Dungeons & Dragons, contrasting them with the careful alignment of books into the well-recognized series produced under 3.5.

Commissioned in 1932, she was given the pennant number 61S and was assigned to the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. At the start of World War II, Swordfish was missed with three torpedoes by her sister ship after being mistaken for a German U-boat. On 20 April 1940, she attacked a German convoy, but her torpedoes failed to hit their targets. Two days later, she sighted another convoy, but did not attack it because of the ships' shallow draught. In the morning of 26 April, she dived to avoid drifting mines; one of them hit but did not explode. During her sixth war patrol, Swordfish was mistakenly bombed by a British aircraft, but sustained no damage. Swordfish disappeared during her twelfth patrol, after departing Portsmouth on 7 November. Although she initially thought to have been sunk by German destroyers, she was determined to have been sunk by a mine when her wreck was discovered in July 1983 off Brest, France.

When submerged each propeller was driven by a electric motor. They could reach on the surface and underwater.Bagnasco, p. 110 On the surface, the first-batch boats had a range of at and at submerged. The boats were armed with six torpedo tubes in the bow. They carried six reload torpedoes for a grand total of a dozen torpedoes. They were also armed with a deck gun. Construction and career Swordfish was ordered on 2 July 1930 and was laid down by Chatham Dockyard on 1 December that same year. The submarine was launched on 10 November 1931 and commissioned on 28 November 1932.HMS Swordfish, uboat.net At the onset of World War II, Swordfish was a member of the 2nd Submarine Flotilla. From 23‚Äì26 August 1939 the 2nd Submarine Flotilla moved to their war bases at Dundee and Blyth.Rohwer, p.1 On 1 September, the day the war started, Swordfish departed Dundee for her first war patrol, southwest of Stavanger, Norway. On 14 September, southeast of Aberdeen, Scotland in position 56¬∞22'N, 01¬∞28'W, she was mistaken for a U-boat by her sister ship , which fired three torpedoes. Swordfish dived and the torpedoes missed. On 23 September she left Dundee for her second patrol, west of Denmark. Informed the next day of the attack of , she was ordered to stay away from the area and returned to Dundee on 3 October. Between 3 October 1939 and 13 March 1940, she refitted in Dundee, then conducted training exercises. On 22 March, she left port for another patrol, in the western approach to the Skagerrak strait. Swordfish sighted only neutral ships during this patrol and returned to Blyth on 8 April. Swordfish departed Blyth again on 16 April for another patrol in the Skagerrak. On 20 April, she sighted and attacked a German convoy, made up of Three heavy transports and four escorts in position . Her torpedoes missed, but Swordfish was attacked with depth charges until the evening by the convoy's escorts. Two days later, she sighted another convoy of trawlers and escorts but did not attack them due to their shallow draught, which would have caused the torpedoes to run under the ships. In the morning of 26 April, Swordfish sighted several drifting mines coming towards her; one of these struck as Swordfish was diving, but failed to explode. Swordfish returned to Blyth two days later, ending her fourth patrol. Swordfish conducted an uneventful patrol from 10 to 25 May in the North Sea. On 5 June, she departed Blyth for her sixth war patrol in the North Sea. The next day, she was bombed in error by a Lockheed Hudson of No. 224 Squadron RAF, but no damage was sustained. After returning to Blyth, Swordfish conducted another patrol, but only aircraft were sighted. On her eighth patrol, she same across the yacht Maski, which was fleeing to the United Kingdom. After taking in the yacht's crew, Swordfish sank it with gunfire. She then conducted a tenth and eleventh patrol, missing several ships with torpedoes. Nothing was heard from her following her departure from Portsmouth on 7 November 1940 with 40 crew on board to relieve which was on patrol off the Western Approaches near Brest, France. At the time it was thought that she had been sunk by a German destroyer.Submarine losses 1904 to present day, RN Submarine Museum, Gosport However she was discovered by a local diver in 1983, split into two just forward of the gun by a mine.*Disappearance of HMS Swordfish, Isle of Wight index The wreck lies in about 46 metres of water roughly 12 miles south of St. Catherine's Point, Isle of Wight in position .

Unlike most other D&D; settings, however, Ghostwalk was designed to be released as a single book which would contain all the material for the world. Contents The central locale for the Ghostwalk setting is a city called Manifest, a mausoleum city built atop a geological feature known as the Veil of Souls which leads the spirits of the departed on to the True Afterlife. In the immediate surroundings of the city of Manifest, the ghosts of the dead may cross the barrier into the land of the living and interact with their loved ones as translucent beings forged of ectoplasm, their ghost bodies marked by whatever injuries killed them and often driven by some craving for some aspect of the living world, such as music or food. A manifested ghost may fairly easily be returned to his body by resurrection magic and so in the City of Manifest one may die a great many times and be returned to his body with no harmful side effects. The one danger in exploring the other side of death as a ghost is the Calling, an unshakable urge that overcomes ghosts at some point in their unlife that drives them to forsake the world and pass into the True Afterlife. Such a transition is permanent and marks the end of a character While all sentient races have spirits, only the human and demihuman races (human, half-elf, half-orc, elf, gnome, dwarf, and halfling) can travel to Manifest and live again as ghosts. A great many nonhuman races are jealous of this gift, and have sought to destroy Manifest throughout its history. Several times they have succeeded, razing the city to the ground, forcing it to be rebuilt atop its own ruins. This has resulted in an underworld of forgotten catacombs, all that is left of the many cities left behind. Below these are vast natural caverns and tunnels that increase in size and complexity surrounding the Veil of Souls. All of these are filled with all manner of monsters and villains, but also treasures lost. Hence Manifest is home to adventurers as well as mourners and the dead Of the enemies of the City of Manifest, perhaps the most persistent are the Yuan-ti, snake people who long for power and immortality and thus hate everything the city stands for. =Chapter summary= Introduction: Includes information on the campaign options and the general concept of Ghostwalk and the city of Manifest itself. # All About Ghosts.: Contains information on the nature of Ghosts presented in the book as well as their characteristics and powers.

Cover art was by Brom, with interior art by Thomas Baxa, Dennis Cramer, Michael Dutton, Emily Fiegenschuh, Jeremy Jarvis, David Martin, Puddnhead, Vinod Rams, Wayne Reynolds, Scott Roller, Richard Sardinha, and Ron Spencer. Sean Reynolds explained where the idea came from, to make it possible to play a dead PC as a ghost: \\"I think it was just a matter of Monte and me understanding that one of the least fun parts of the game is when a character dies. Not only is there a feeling of loss regarding the character, but also the player doesn't have anything to do until a new character can be brought in. We thought a campaign where a character's death wouldn't be the end of play for that character or player would be a neat twist on standard D&D.;\\" Reception References External links * Ghostwalk forum at The Piazza (largest fan community online) Category:2003 books Category:Dungeons & Dragons campaign settings Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ","title":"Ghostwalk"},{"id":"3903138","text":"Daddy's Highway is the 1987 debut album by New Zealand indie rock group The Bats.

Location The island is located on the north side where the Dnieper enters premises of Kyiv city, with its north part extending some distance north towards the mouth of Desna River. It is located in the confluence of both Desna River and Dnieper River. Situated up the stream of Dnieper within the city of Kyiv, the island starts a system of Dnieper River islands which ends with the Olzhyn Island. Up the stream of Dnieper River to the north of Trukhaniv is located the Great Island (Velykyi), to the east along Desenka is Lopukhovaty, down the stream to the south are located Venetsiansky and Dolobetsky islands. There are also several other smaller islands located around the Trukhaniv Island. The island is separated from the right-bank Kyiv by the Dnieper and from the left-bank Kyiv by Desenka which is a distributary of Desna River, making Trukhaniv island part of its river delta. The Trukhaniv island is split by another distributary called Bobrovnia which serves a conditional border between the territory of Vyshhorod Raion and the Kyiv city. Technically Bobrovnia splits the island into Ilya Muromets Island (north, in Vyshhorod Raion) and Trukhaniv Island (south, in Kyiv). The Kyiv's portion of island administratively is part of Dniprovskyi city district. It has an area of . The island is mostly covered by greenery, like the Venetsiansky island nearby. Until 1957, the only method of transportation to the island was by boat in the summer or by crossing the ice in the winter. In 1957, the Park Pedestrian Bridge was built, easing the travel to and from the island. Trukhaniv Island contains numerous caf√©s, restaurants, sports complexes, and the largest as well as one of the cleanest city beaches. The island is not only popular for its various leisure activities, but it is also for fishing on the Dnieper River. In the summer, some parts of the island are used for biking, and in the winter some parts are used for cross-country skiing. In the summer of 2005, tourists traveling to see the Eurovision Song Contest 2005 were housed on Trukhaniv Island.

The summer residence of his daughter and her husband was allegedly named in honor of Tugor-khan, although in truth his name is mentioned but once in Slavonic chronicles. In 1534 the island came under control of the Pustynno-Mykilsky monastery, and was later returned to the city in 1698. The first buildings on the island were erected in the beginning of the 19th century. During the 1880s, the first businesses began to appear on the island. During the Second World War German forces completely destroyed the island settlements in order to have better control and a clearer view of the city of Kyiv. In post-war times, the island was not rebuilt as a settlement, but as a leisure center. Gallery File:Bobrovnya 2-nd bridge.JPGThere are two bridges over Bobrovnia, both pedestrian.

Known for his experimentation with form and color, Carder's work remains popular among collectors and can be found in numerous museum collections, including The Corning Museum of Glass, which houses the Frederick Carder Gallery, Chrysler Museum of Art, and the Detroit Institute of Arts. He was born in Staffordshire, England, and died in Corning, New York, where he had made his home since 1903.  Family life  Frederick Carder was born in the village of Wordsley, near Stourbridge, in Staffordshire, England on September 18, 1863, to parents Caleb and Ann Carder. Caleb Carder worked as a salesperson for his father, George Carder, at his pottery, Ley's, formed around 1810. Caleb and his brothers (Frederick's uncles) Joshua and Henry took over the pottery after George died, though Caleb ran the pottery alone for many years. After Caleb's retirement, Frederick's younger brothers Albert and Arthur took over. Frederick Carder also had older brothers named Will and George and an older sister named Annie. Frederick Carder married Annie Walker on May 21, 1887, in Dudley, Worcestershire. They had three children: a daughter Gladys (1889-1969), a son Stanley (1892-?), and a son Cyril (1893-1918). Annie died in May 1943.  Education  Carder left school at age 14 to work in his father's pottery. He enrolled in night school at the Strourbridge School of Art and the Dudley Mechanic Institute, where he studied chemistry. In 1891, Carder started the Wordsley School of Art for glassworkers. In 1960, Alfred University honored Carder with an honorary doctorate degree.  Career  =Stevens & Williams (1881‚Äì1903)= Frederick Carder began his glassmaking career with Stevens & Williams in 1881, where he helped re-introduce colored glass. While at Stevens & Williams, Carder worked with Peter Faberg√© of Russia. In 1902, Carder was asked to compile a survey of current glassmaking techniques in other countries, including the United States. After 20 years of glass design and glassmaking experience, disagreements developed within Stevens & Williams. As a result, Carder and his family emigrated to the United States. =Steuben (1903‚Äì1932)= 'Frederick Carder and Thomas G. Hawkes (of Hawkes crystal) co-founded the Steuben Glass Works in Corning, NY, the home of Corning Glass Company (also known as Corning Glass Works). Carder ran Steuben Glass Works from 1903 until 1932. In 1918, Corning Glass purchased Steuben Glass Works, with Frederick Carder continuing to manage all aspects of the business. 1932, the advent of the Great Depression had a negative impact on business at Steuben. Corning Glass terminated the production of colored glass and took over the direction of the Steuben division, Carder was made artistic director for all Corning divisions. page 71 \\"History of the Corning Painted Post Area : 200 Years in Painted Post Country\\" (revised edition published in 1991) by Thomas P. Dimitroff and Lois S. Janes has the name of Thomas G. Hawkes who was a founder of the Steuben Glass Works with Frederick Carder. Thomas Gibbons Hawkes came from England and was formerly foreman of J. Hoare & Company. Thomas G. Hawkes established the Hawkes Rich Cut Glass Works on March 12, 1882. =After Steuben (1932‚Äì1959)= In 1932, Steuben Glass Works reorganized under a new team headed by Arthur A. Houghton, Jr., John Gates, and Sidney Waugh. Using a new glass known as G10M, Steuben crystal products became colorless and clear. While not specifically managing Steuben operations, Frederic Carder continued in Corning by directing all aspects of Corning's design, manufacturing, and marketing of many glass products. During this period, he experimented with glass casting using the cire perdue (lost wax) method used in metal foundries. He made his notes and formulas available to others wishing to cast glass. In 1943, Carder's wife Annie died. In 1959, Carder retired from Corning Glass Works. He died in December 1963, eighty-three days after his 100th birthday. An elementary school located in Corning was given the name Frederick Carder School in his honor. In 2005 Steuben Gallery, in Manhattan, mounted an exhibition of Carder's work that was curated by Donald Albrecht. The exhibition, called Frederick Carder: Glass, Passion, Invention, was designed by Pure+Applied. Photographs of the exhibition .

The year 1058 saw the ascension of Malcolm III to the throne of Scotland. His reign marks a significant cultural, economic, and political shift away from Scandinavia and towards England and the European Continent ‚Äì most noticeable in his marriage to Margaret, the sister of Edgar Aetheling, who was the primary dynastic rival to William I, Duke of Normandy, for the throne of England following the Norman Conquest of England in 1066.Richard Oram, Domination and Lordship: Scotland 1070-1230 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2011), p. 2. The end of this period is marked by the death of Alexander III in 1286, which then led indirectly to the Scottish Wars of Independence. This period corresponds roughly with the High Middle Ages in Europe, which is generally ascribed to the 11th to the 13th centuries and the Medieval Warm Period, which directly affected the Scottish agrarian economy. Political geography The Kingdom of Scotland was not identical to its modern geographical boundaries. Rather, the period is marked by further domination of Scottish hinterlands. During Malcolm III's reign, the lands he directly controlled consisted of the Lowlands north of the Firth of Forth, as well as the regions of Lothian and Cumbria, though forced to perform homage to the King of England for these lands until the conclusion of the Scottish Wars of Independence. Although the Scottish monarchy held nominal lordship over Moray, Galloway, and parts of the Western Isles, these supposed vassals often acted irrespective or in direct opposition to Scottish interests. In addition, the Earls of Orkney and Caithness often performed homage to both the King of Scotland and the King of Norway, which demonstrates the limited authority Scotland held over the mainland and outer islands. However, the period from Malcolm III to Alexander III sees the effective expansion of the Scottish kings‚Äô power over the rival centers and the implementation of royal authority. David I and Alexander II are perhaps the most visible examples of this expansion ‚Äì with their imposition of new regional lords in the Moray, Galloway, and Argyll ‚Äì but there was a consistent progression towards greater unity and control. Feudalism As mentioned above, this period in Scottish history marks a cultural, economic, and political shift toward Continental institutions, practices, and relationships. The most notable of these is the introduction of a more formalized version of Feudalism. Generally speaking, feudalism was the structuring of society based upon hierarchical relationships whereby the holding of land was exchanged in return for service, generally military, or labor.F. L. Ganshof, Feudalism (London: Longmans Green, 1952), p. xv. In addition to military service or labor, the lord would require dues, in either coinage, as is generally the case between the monarch and his vassals, or in-kind payment ‚Äì which was the standard between a lord and the peasantry.Diana Wood, Medieval Economic Thought, (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 34. In Scotland, this payment was referred to as c√°in. The c√°in was generally paid in the form of the area's main produce.A. A. M. Duncan, Scotland, Making of the Kingdom (New York: Barnes and Noble, 1975), pp. 153-4. The term denotes both the regular exaction of an area's revenue by the king, like the Scottish king's exaction of payment in the Southern Uplands, as well as irregular tribute to a superior authority, as was the case in Moray during its period of quasi-independence prior to the mid-11th century.Oram, pp. 75, 232. =Lord-vassal relationship= This system was heavily reliant upon personal relationships and oaths of fealty to maintain political authority and economic domination.Rhys Jones, ‚ÄúMann and Men in a Medieval State‚Äù Transactions of the Institute of British Geographers, 24, no. 1 (1999), p. 66. Relationships were often left vague when royal authority was limited. For example, the Scottish Crown maintained only loose authority over the Earls of Galloway until Alan, Earl of Galloway, died in 1234 with no legitimate male heir, and Alexander III divided the inheritance among royal supporters with weak familial ties to the earldom.Oram, p. 193 This ambiguity generally supported greater stability at the expense of the royal treasury, as the c√°in was collected infrequently, if at all. Scotland and England's relationship was performed in much the same way. The Scottish kings performed homage to the English king for royal lands in Cumbria and Lothian except during periods of English strength or Scottish weakness. For example, the Scottish king William the Lion swore fealty to Henry II of England in 1175 as stipulated in the Treaty of Falaise, which explicitly declared William held all of Scotland as a fief.Oram, p. 137. However, even during these periods of English supremacy, payment was exacted more as tribute for peace than vassalage dues. Richard Oram describes the terms of treaty and their ‚Äúlight touch,‚Äù emphasizing the limited economic impact on Scotland: ‚ÄúHenry also demanded control of royal castles in Lothian ‚Äì Berwick, Jedburgh, Roxburgh, Edinburgh and Stirling, but sought neither men nor money for his wars, nor did he hear appeals from Scottish law courts‚Äù. However, this period of ambiguity between the Scottish monarch and his vassals gradually became more formalized during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries as the Crown asserted greater political authority over mainland Scotland. In Moray, for instance, David I drew the troublesome district into his direct sphere through claiming of castles as royal property and the settling of English nobility explicitly loyal the king, and not local ties in mid-12th century.Oram, p. 83. =Criticisms of Feudal Terminology= In spite of the fact that most historians agree that from the 11th century through the 13th marks at minimum a greater formalization of feudalistic hierarchical relationships and structures,Oram, p. 199. the wholesale adoption of the classic manorial feudalism as an explanation for Scottish rural economy has been widely criticized. A. D. M. Barrell claims that unlike in England, where the Norman Conquest enabled the monarchy to redefine societal relationships through the major expropriation of native lords, Scotland was never conquered.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 19. Therefore, the settlers introduced into Scotland were on top of existing socio-economic structures forcing the new population to tread carefully over established practices. In addition, Susan Reynolds argued that land was not held as a grant from the king, but rather engaged in military service and paid taxes commiserate with their economic and societal standing.Susan Reynolds, ‚ÄúFiefs and Vassals in Scotland: A View from Outside‚Äù, Scottish Historical Review, 82, no. 2 (2003), p. 183. Another obstacle frequently used to limit the applicability of feudal terminology to Scotland during this period was the relative importance of pastoralism, especially in the Northern and Western Highlands, over sedentary farming.Barrell, p. 19. The inability to tie the peasantry to the land in much of Scotland, like in England, limited the lord's ability to extract economic resources and exert political control over from the peasantry. Agriculture Significant inroads were being made in Scottish agricultural practices during the High Middle Ages. This can partly be attributed to the Medieval Warm Period. This climatic change resulted in warmer, drier conditions throughout Northern Europe. Farming in Scotland therefore could be expanded into higher altitudes that were previously too cold for agriculture and valleys that were prone to floods or marsh conditions.H. H. Lamb, ‚ÄúTrees and Climatic History of Scotland‚Äù, Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 90, no. 386 (1964), p. 392. The expansion of agricultural production capability was accompanied by improvements in labor saving technologies that increased crop yields and pastoral output.Duncan, Scotland, Making of the Kingdom, pp. 310-11 These included the carruca-type plough, which was more effective at plowing tougher soil, improved animal harnesses that shortened the time required for clearance in woodlands, and water mills that ‚Äúfreed more time and concomitantly more labor... which could then be applied to other activities.‚ÄùOram, p. 234. These factors in congruence directly led to the expansion of agriculture into new areas and the intensification of existing arable lands that increased annual yields and indirectly caused an increase in population.Christopher Dyer, Making a Living in the Middle Ages: The People of Britain 850-1520 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2002), p. 179. =Assarts= In practice, this expansion into new lands manifested itself in the form of assarts. Assarts were lands that were newly cultivated from land formerly considered ‚Äòwaste.‚Äô There were several different versions of the expansion. The reclamation of valleys prone to flooding and planting at higher altitudes due to the warmer and drier climate have already been mentioned. Another substantial method of exploitation was the gradual push into forests. Forests were areas under the direct control of the king typically used for hunting and under special jurisdiction.Barrell, p. 36. Although the forest law in Scotland was noticeably more lax than England, much of it was still restricted from agricultural production. It is worth clarifying that the forest considered ‚Äòwaste‚Äô does not directly compare with modern usage of the term. This is not to say that these lands were completely absent of production. Richard Oram identifies the value of these regions to local inhabitants: ‚Äúthe afforested area was exploited routinely by the inhabitants of the settlements that lined its margins, as summer pasture for cattle and sheep, a source of autumn pannage for pigs and of winter feed for the livestock left unslaughtered in November, and for building materials and fuel‚Äù.Oram, p. 242. During this period the monarchy acquiesced to the forests, especially in the lands more suitable for planting of cereals, to be made available for cultivation. This contributed to a slow transition from pastoralism to plant-based agriculture, but only in limited areas. Indeed, the pastoral economy experienced much of the same growth that landed cultivation enjoyed from the warming climate, as higher altitudes became suitable for grazing. However, there remained significant competition between the competing industries for land use throughout highlands and lowlands, alike.Oram, p. 259. =Pastoralism= Although the planting of cereals was becoming increasingly common in the Lowlands, its impact on much of Scotland was relatively unsubstantial to the overall economic output. Herding of animals remained primary means of subsistence and the most important form of agriculture for most of the Scottish mainland. Only about 40% of total land area was below 500 feet above sea level, compared to 78% in England.Bruce Campbell, ‚ÄúBenchmarking Medieval Economic Development: England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland, c.1290‚Äù, The Economic History Review, 61, no.4 (2008), p. 921. This meant that a majority of Scotland was less profitable for plant-based agriculture compared to animal husbandry. Economic historian Bruce Campbell explains that the impact of pastoral agriculture is somewhat muted in the historical record that relies on parish churches for wealth statistics, ‚Äúbecause tithes on [animal] products were less straightforward to collect.‚ÄùCampbell, p. 903. Even in areas that would be more suitable for farming were slow to transform. Galloway for instance, in the words of G. W. S. Barrow, ‚Äúalready famous for its cattle, was so overwhelming pastoral, that there is little evidence in that region of land under permanent cultivation, save along the Solway coast‚Äù.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000-1360 (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1981), p. 12. Trade =Burghs= Burghs founded before the death of King David I Scottish trade during the High Middle Ages was largely centered around the ‚Äúburgh‚Äù or ‚Äúburgess.‚Äù These burghs enjoyed a variety of privileges, but most fundamental to their existence was the monopoly on the buying and selling of goods within its given territory. Although there existed limited trading settlements prior to the 11th century, verified by the excavations at Whithorn, the granting of burgh status strongly incentivized the growth of towns.Peter Hill, Ewan Cambell, et.al., Whithorn & St. Ninian: the Excavation of a Monastic Town, 1984-91 (Stroud, UK: Whithorn Trust, 1997), p. 23. David I was the most prolific king at awarding this burgh status to various trading centers and his successor, William the Lion, followed suit. By the end of David's reign in 1153 there were seventeen burghs, and by William's death in 1214 there were forty recorded burghs.Oram, 265. Of these newly created burghs, Berwick-upon-Tweed was the largest, most successful and most influential and remained so until the Scottish Wars of Independence.Campbell, p. 910 These burghs provided tangible benefits to the crown as well as boosting overall trade. The king benefited financially in three ways: royal monopolies, tolls, and burgess rents. The first method, royal monopolies, enabled the crown to sell or grant the rights for exclusive distribution of goods within the burgh's proscribed boundary.Barrell, p. 34. The second key method of boosting revenue was the collection of tolls. These taxes were placed upon goods purchased in a burgh's hinterland ‚Äì as only the burgh itself was toll-free ‚Äì and enforced by inhabitants of the outlying areas were forced to buy and sell solely through the burgh. However, this was often difficult to enforce, and therefore the crown often relied upon burgess rents to compensate. The burgesses paid the rents, also known as ferme, annually to the king in exchange for maintaining their status. Together, these revenue- boosting methods were the primary cash income for the Scottish crown.Oram, p. 274. Some historians have speculated that David's expansion of burgh status was partly motivated by the desire to open up Scotland to wider international trade networks. During this period, Flanders was experiencing a boom in the cloth industry motivated improvements in weaving production. This in turn increased demand for wool, which Scotland produced in abundance. In spite of England's dominance of the market, Scotland was able to share in the spoils of the boom ‚Äì partly due to its utilization of colonists, whether Flemish, English, or French, that supplied capital and expertise into an underdeveloped industry.Oram, p. 271. =Money supply= This period of Scottish history also marked the profound growth of the money supply within Scotland. The initial cause of the growth of the money supply was domestic factors. A silver mining boom in northern England enabled David I to develop Scotland's first minted coins. The increase in available capital helped fuel commercial development, especially in Scotland and England, which gained directly from the mines in the Pennines.Campbell, 919. However, even when the mines were exhausted of silver, the current account surplus enabled the money supply to continue growing. ‚ÄúDuring the thirteenth century, a positive and reciprocal relationship therefore existed between the growth of overseas trade, expansion of the money supplies, and advance of commercialization,‚Äù describes economic historian Bruce Campbell.Campbell, p. 920. Catholic Church As the only pan-European organization the Catholic Church commanded both spiritual and temporal power during the High Middle Ages. One of the key manifestations of this power was its important role in the economic affairs of a state. These represent a significant portion of Scotland's overall economy due to the ten percent tithe paid by the faithful, their occasional role as temporal lord within the feudal system, and the production of land owned by the parish.Campbell, p. 902. Their economic situation was further supplemented, by the fact that in most cases the parishes enjoyed a tax-exempt status from the state. In many ways, the Church acts as both a driver of economic growth and an indicator of it, through the availability of tax records that have survived. Economic historian Bruce Campbell estimates the total number of ecclesiastical parishes at around 960 in 1290. The wealth of these parishes varied significantly. Some village parishes existed on subsistence levels similar to the peasantry, while the large dioceses were considered nobles in all but name. For instance, the dioceses of St. Andrews and Glasgow had estimated total assets of ¬£13,724 and ¬£11,144, respectively in 1290. These two dioceses alone account for almost two thirds of total spiritual and temporal assets of the Catholic Church in Scotland. Overall assessment By the end of the 13th century, Scotland remained highly rural with a significantly smaller and on average poorer population than its southern neighbor.Campbell, p. 931. However, significant strides towards a stronger economy were taken during this period: the formalization of feudal relationships and expansion of the Scottish monarchy allowed for greater exploitation of agricultural production ‚Äì pastoral and plant-based, the Medieval Warm Period and relaxation of forest law generated agricultural expansion into new fields and pastures, and the introduction of burghs enabled the initial urbanization and opened Scotland to international trade. Campbell succinctly sums up the state of the Scottish economy at the end of the High Middle Ages compared to Ireland, which possessed a similar geographic size and population: ‚ÄúOn the eve of the War of Independence the Scottish economy was larger, commercially more dynamic, and more monetized than that of Ireland and, in the speed with which its money supply was growing, bears favourable comparison with its far larger and, in aggregate, wealthier southern neighbour, England.‚ÄùCampbell, p. 921.

Its objective is also to reduce death and disability caused by any disturbances in normal functioning of the mind or the body that would require surgery. The CNIS emphasizes education in surgical work and techniques. It also works in surgical development and research.Lett, Ronald. ‚ÄúCanadian Network for International Surgery: Development Activities and Strategies.‚Äù Canadian Journal of Surgery Vol. 43, No. 5, Oct. 2000, pgs. 385-387. The CNIS was federally incorporated in August 1995 and is managed by an eight- to nine-member board of directors Canadian Network for International Surgery. CNIS Winter 2008 Operative Report with representation from all over Canada. It has a nationwide membership of physicians, surgeons, and others. The CNIS office is located in Vancouver, British Columbia with satellite office(s) in Africa. Activities The CNIS has described itself as having a \\"4-pronged approach\\" to aid. This includes the development, delivery and adaptation of Essential Surgical Skills (ESS) and Basic Surgical Skills (BSS) courses, work in injury prevention, the exchange of surgical information and work in public engagement. =ESS and BSS Courses= The CNIS is engaged with academic departments or professional associations in the southern hemisphere; one reason why the CNIS was founded was to develop northern infrastructure in order to make Canadian surgeons more effective in an international situation.Lett, Ronald. ‚ÄúInternational surgery: definition, principles and Canadian practice.‚Äù Canadian Journal of Surgery 46:5 Oct 2003 pp 365-372. Delivery of Essential Surgical Skills includes 5-day workshops in which clinicians who are not surgeons are taught basic surgical interventions and life-saving skills. The BSS course is a 2-day workshop, with topics that include lymph node biopsy, tendon repair, and blood vessel anastomosis. The BSS course is an example of training that was developed at the request of an African learning institution. =Injury Prevention= According to the World Health Organization, injuries and violence account for 9% of global mortality. World Health Organization, \\"Introduction: Preventing injuries and violence: a guide for ministries of health (2007)\\" Two-thirds of deaths due to injury occur in the developing world.Kobusingye, O. and R. Lett. \\"Hospital-Based Trauma Registries in Uganda\\" in The Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and Critical Care Volume 48(3) Mar 2000 pp 498-50. It has been argued that injury prevention in low-income countries is an under-scrutinized field. S. N. Forjuoh et al. \\"Injury control in Africa: getting governments to do more\\" Tropical Medicine & International Health, Volume 3, Number 5, May 1998, pp. 349-356. One of the CNIS's primary concerns is injury and, from that, injury-risk reduction. Reducing injury would reduce the need for surgery, while improving access to surgery for residents of low-income countries would improve their overall health. The CNIS has established injury control centers with local governments. =Surgical Information= Through the Surgical Information Program, the CNIS supports medical school and hospital libraries in Africa by sending new or recent surgical/medical books and journals. The CNIS also funds two African students' and one Canadian student's research scholarship at the Injury Control Centre - Uganda (ICC-U). With the help of the Canadian Journal of Surgery, the CNIS provides editorial support to the Association of Surgeons of East and Central Africa Journal of Surgery. =Public Engagement= The CNIS has acted across Canada through its Public Engagement Program, which publicizes the need for access to safe surgical and obstetrical care in Africa. It has recruited Canadian surgical professionals to take part in international surgery projects. Activities have included workshops and seminars, language training, newsletters and cultural events. Collaborating Countries So far, the CNIS appears to have concentrated its international outreach within the continent of Africa. They have implemented surgical skills training courses in Addis Ababa, Jimma, Gondor, Mekele, and Hawassa in Ethiopia; Blantyre and Lilongwe in Malawi; Bamako, Mali; Maputo in Mozambique; Butare in Rwanda; Dar es Salaam and Moshi in Tanzania; and Mbarara and Gulu in Uganda. The CNIS has begun obstetrical skills training programs in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Kampala, Uganda. They initiated injury control center work in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania and Kampala, Uganda. Program Support Unit (PSU) This is the first office of CNIS in Africa. The Program Support Unit (PSU) is located in the Black Lion Hospital at Addis Ababa University Surgical Skills Lab, Ethiopia and it supports CNIS activities in Africa. Surgical and Obstetrical Skills Training Project in Ethiopia In 2005, the CNIS launched a new innovation project to establish surgical learning centers at six universities in Ethiopia. The universities in this project will have learning centers that are dedicated for surgical and obstetrical care at the end of the project. The project also will have an institutional capacity- building component where surgical department staff will attend workshops in management, leadership and fund raising skills. The project builds on results of previous efforts, which are intended to promote long-term capacity-building in obstetrical and surgical operations and care. The learning centers will train and certify primary care physicians, surgeons, instructors, and other health professionals as well as build up the universities' own institutional capacity (fund-raising, creating linkages are examples of the needs addressed). It is intended that they will provide growing support for hospitals, health centers, and clinics across Ethiopia to address the critical health needs of the population. Funding for this innovation project was procured mainly through two agencies. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) granted $200,000 for the project, while the Toronto Chapter of the Ethiopian North American Health Professionals Association (ENAHPA) matched the CIDA fund based on an Memorandum of Understanding of mutual support signed in May 2005. ENAHPA will provide $100,000 for the project; the CNIS agreed to provide obstetrical and essential skills training to assist ENAHPA's safe motherhood project in Awassa.

Religious practices * Sacrificing to gods other than YHWH * Passing children through the fire to/as [MLK]. The triconsonantal root MLK has traditionally been translated as if it were the name of an otherwise unattested deity ‚Äì Moloch ‚Äì but may just describe a type of sacrifice. It is generally thought that this refers to a form of human sacrifice similar to that of which the Phoenicians (particularly in Carthage) have historically been widely accused However, the Septuagint reads \\"You shall not give your seed to serve a ruler\\", suggesting that the root M-L-K should be more properly rendered as 'king/ruler'. This was not a capital crime but resulted in the offenders being cut off from their people; that is, cast out. * Worshipping Baal Peor. The death penalty here was specifically impaling. * False prophecy * Necromancy, according to the Masoretic Text; specifically those who are masters over ghosts (Hebrew: Ba'al ob) and those who gain information from the dead (Hebrew: Yidde'oni). The Septuagint instead condemns gastromancy (Greek: eggastrimuthos), and enchantment (Greek: epaoidos).Leviticus 20:27 (LXX) * According to the Masoretic Text, practitioners of kashaph ‚Äì incanting maleficium.

Both parties were to die. * Loss of virginity by a woman prior to marriage, to someone other than her husband while falsely representing herself as a virgin before the marriage ceremony * Marrying one's wife's mother. This was in addition to one's wife; death was by burning. * Certain forms of incest, namely if it involves the father's wife or a daughter-in-law. Other forms of incest receive lesser punishment; sexual activity with a sister/stepsister is given excommunication for a punishment; if it involves a brother's wife or an uncle's wife it is just cursed and sexual activity with an aunt that is a blood relation is merely criticized. * Male on male sexual intercourse. Certain sexual activities between males (Hebrew: zakhar) involving what the Masoretic Text literally terms lie lyings (of a) woman (Hebrew: tishkav mishkvei ishah), and the Septuagint literally terms beds [verb] the woman's/wife's bed (Greek: koimethese koiten gynaikos);Leviticus 18:22 (LXX)Leviticus 20:13 (LXX) the gender of the target of the command is commonly understood to be male, but not explicitly stated.

Even though the promoter‚Äôs group originally designed it for the desktop computer to monitor application, the majority of applications today are industrial display connections. For example, displays in medical imaging, machine vision, and construction equipment use the OpenLDI chipsets. The SGI 1600SW used the interface. OpenLDI is based on the FPD-Link specification, which was the de facto standard for transferring graphics and video data through notebook computer hinges since the late 1990s. Both OpenLDI and FPD-Link use low- voltage differential signaling (LVDS) as the physical layer signaling, and the three terms have mistakenly been used synonymously. (FPD-Link and OpenLDI are largely compatible, beyond the physical-layer; specifying the same serial data-streams). The OpenLDI standard was promoted by National Semiconductor, Texas Instruments, Silicon Graphics (SGI) and others. OpenLDI wasn't used in many of the intended applications after losing the computer-to-monitor interconnect application to a competing standard, Digital Visual Interface (DVI). The SGI 1600SW was the only monitor produced in significant quantities with an OpenLDI connection, though it had minor differences from the final published standards. The 1600SW used a 36-pin MDR36 male connector with a pinout that differs from that of the 36-pin centronics-style connector in the OpenLDI standard. Sony produced some VAIO displays and laptops using the standard. (According to the SGI 1600SW entry, a few other displays were made by various manufacturers using the OpenLDI standard.)

Often referred to as Stan the Man, he presented the first rock and roll music on Melbourne radio from 1956, on 3KZ, and was a champion of Australian music. From February 1966 to March 1971 he was also a gossip news columnist for teen music newspaper, Go-Set. His \\"critical editorial like columns sought to prompt Australian pop musicians to do better.\\" Stan Rofe died of cancer, aged 69, and was survived by his brother, Roy, and extended family. In 2015, Rofe was inducted into the Music Victoria Hall of Fame.  Biography  Stanley Rofe was born on 30 May 1933 in Richmond, a suburb of Melbourne. His father was an Essendon footballer and his mother was a former Tivoli dancer and show girl. He grew up with a younger brother, Roy. Rofe was a student at Faraday Street State School in Carlton and later at Collingwood Technical School. As a young child Rofe was a fan of radio station 3KZ. His favourite announcer was Norman Banks who set the trend in the 1940s. To rehearse being Banks, Rofe would use kitchen pots for reverberation effects; these rehearsals occurred for years as his mother encouraged his aspiration for a radio career. Rofe commenced work at sixteen and a year later he was teaching ballroom dancing and was a member of the Victorian Square Dance Championship Team that was third in their national competition. At eighteen Rofe was called up for three months national service training, which was followed by four years in the Citizens' Military Forces. Early in 1953, after three days tuition at the Bill Roberts Radio School, a position was secured with 7AD in Devonport, Tasmania. After a few weeks Rofe was made Chief Announcer and later recalled, \\"it was a frightening experience that was too quick to worry about\\". Returning to Melbourne, he joined 3AK later that year, before moving to 3XY alongside Bert Newton when the station broadcast out of the Princess Theatre in Spring Street. He became known as Stan the Man and started his shows with, \\"Hi-de-hi, Victoria!\\". He recalled attending parties at 3XY's station owner, Frank Thring's family home, \\"Bert and I were always terrified at his parties, we never knew what was going to happen.\\" Rofe moved to 3KZ in 1955. He took up an afternoon trial slot combining popular music with listener's requests; he presented \\"Call up KZ\\", which required listeners to identify recordings. Phil Gibbs, 3KZ's program manager, had Rofe call night football games at South Melbourne's home ground. On occasions he would broadcast with Gibbs and Harry Mueller at Saturday games. For the Melbourne Olympic Games in 1956, Rofe was one of seventeen local commentators accredited by the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting. At the end of the Olympics Rofe presented \\"Spin for the Stars\\" and was intrigued as to how fellow DJ John Laws had secured American newly- released records. Laws used Qantas pilots to bring singles from the United States and Britain. Some were from the Memphis-based Sun label's artists including Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins. Rofe copied Laws idea and incorporated the latest singles into his show, where they were inter-mixed with tracks by Perry Como, Peggy Lee, Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby, Doris Day and Frank Sinatra. Before the end of 1956 Rofe had introduced rock-n-roll to Melbourne radio. Aside from Rofe's radio work he sponsored weekly dances at the Preston Town Hall from September 1960. He worked at 3KZ broadcasting from the Trades Hall building in Carlton for eight years, then moved to 3UZ, before returning to 3XY as music director in the 1970s. Rofe became a gossip news columnist and adviser for teenage popular music newspaper, Go-Set, in February 1966, while still at 3UZ. David Martin Kent described how his \\"popularity on the radio ensured further reasons to buy and read [the paper].\\" Whilst Rofe supported local artists his \\"critical editorial like columns sought to prompt Australian pop musicians to do better.\\" Fellow gossip columnist at Go-Set was Ian Meldrum. Kent contrasted Rofe's style which \\"became the default editorial. He was extremely critical of the development, or lack of development amongst Australian pop and rock musicians. For this, he was often derided by Go-Sets non-musician readers\\", whilst Meldrum's features \\"were never analytical; they tended to express an immediate view about an issue or personality.\\" According to Kent \\"Rofe had been restrained with respect to his comments on Australian music, Meldrum tended to be more emotional and biased.\\" Rofe's popularity peaked in February 1968 when he was appointed King of Moomba, a local festival. Lily Brett, another Go-Set journalist, interviewed Rofe for their newspaper, \\"Stan Rofe has achieved his notoriety by being outspoken, honest, occasionally bitchy emotionally erratic, and a top disc jockey, intensely involved in the pop world.\\" Rofe also guested on TV music programs, Uptight (1967‚Äì69) and Happening 70 (1970). Rofe had criticised a local band, Procession, on Uptight and branded their single, \\"Anthem\\", as a \\"joke\\" ‚Äì he wagered with Brett that it would not reach 3UZ's top 10, and lost. The group responded with a re- written version of \\"God Save the Queen\\" as \\"Anthem for Stan\\". His last column for Go-Set was in March 1971. He later broadcast on 3DB and finally was heard on Gold-FM, the successor to 3KZ. = Legacy and influence = Rofe helped expand Johnny O'Keefe's (JOK) popularity: he was the first Melbourne DJ to play the artist's debut single, \\"You Hit the Wrong Note Billy Goat\\". Rofe met JOK in 1957 and later remembered, \\"We had a few drinks and we hit it off.\\" He recommended that JOK record a cover of the Isley Brothers' \\"Shout\\", which became the rocker's signature hit. Other artists including Johnny Chester, Ronnie Burns, Russell Morris and Normie Rowe, acknowledged Rofe's assistance in their careers and direction. Ian Meldrum opined that \\"He would encourage young groups to pursue their careers, and he would try and find a gig for them through the influential promoters he knew... At times he would actually pay money out of his own pocket, which today is unheard of.\\" Rofe gave Meldrum the nickname, \\"Molly\\", when they worked together at Go-Set. Morris recalled that \\"[Rofe] was an exceptional, warm man\\", and credits him for suggesting he do a cover of \\"Hush\\", the first hit for his band, Somebody's Image. \\"He was such a huge star, but his door would always be open for any 16-year-old kid who came into his studio with a record.\\" In 1989 Keith Glass issued a single, \\"When Stan Was the Man\\", in homage \\"I grew up listening to [him] on 3KZ... [he] was the best disc jockey in Australia... who played the newer sounds that other stations did not want to go with at the time.\\" At the ARIA Music Awards of 1994 Rofe's services to the music industry were recognised when he was presented with a Special Achievement Award. In August‚ÄìSeptember 2001 Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) ran a six-part series, Long Way to the Top, with Rofe appearing in \\"Episode 1: A Bed of a Thousand Struggles 1956‚Äì1964\\" to describe JOK \\"The wild one really was the wild one.\\" Rofe died on 16 May 2003, aged 69, after being diagnosed with cancer. At his funeral service on 21 May 2003, more than 200 people attended the Trinity College chapel in Parkville, Victoria and they heard Rofe eulogised as a friend, a brother, an uncle, a mentor, a passionate supporter of Australian artists and of the Essendon Football Club. As the mourners left the chapel, \\"When Stan Was the Man\\", was being played. Ed Nimmervoll, another Go-Set journalist dedicated his book, Friday on My Mind (2004) to Rofe, who had inspired him to become focussed on music.

Alpha Phi is a member of the National Panhellenic Conference, the governing council of 26 women's fraternities. Alpha Phi's national headquarters are located in Evanston, Illinois. History At the time of the founding there were only 666 women attending Syracuse; ten of them eventually formed of Alpha Phi to found an organization \\"on the principles of the promotion of growth in character; unity of feeling, sisterly affection, and social communion among the members.\\" Although the actual founding date is September 18, 1872, Alpha Phi has been celebrating their Founder's Day on October 10 since 1902, since many colleges and universities were not open for classes in mid-September at that time.

The fraternity's official colors are bordeaux and silver. The colors were originally blue and gold; however, these colors were similar to those of the Sigma Chi fraternity so they were changed. The official flowers are the Lily of the Valley and the Forget-me-not, and the fraternity lists its ideals as \\"Sisterhood, Generosity, Service, Innovation, and Character.\\" Alpha Phi's public motto is \\"union hand in hand\\". According to Alexandra Robbins, it also has a \\"secret\\" motto, \\"A.O.E.\\" =Badge= The Alpha Phi badge is the Greek letter Alpha resting on the Greek letter Phi, engraved with the Greek acronym A.O.E. It can be customized in silver or gold or adorned with jewels such as diamonds, emeralds, and other precious stones. Prior to the adoption of the current badge in 1906, \\"each member [of Alpha Phi] went to the jeweler of her choice to have her pin designed.\\"AlphaPhi.org The Alpha Phi badge is worn by initiated members, as there is a separate badge for new members before their initiation.

The fraternity officially adopted Cardiac Care as its philanthropic priority in 1946, which then became the Foundation's focus upon its founding in 1956. The Foundation supports programs and research that study heart disease in women ‚Äì specifically its symptoms, its treatment and its prevention. The foundation raises and awards funds and grants for programs in leadership and academics, towards women's heart health, for members with financial needs, and for heritage preservation and education about philanthropy. One way the Foundation helps fund research and educational programs that support the improvement of women's heart health through its annual Heart to Heart Cardiac Care Grant, a $100,000 award towards better understanding gender differences in heart health through increasing heart disease prevention and treatment in women. The fraternity considers the first Friday of February as Red Dress Pin Day and the month of February as Cardiac Care Month where individual Alpha Phi chapters are encouraged to develop a relationship with a local cardiac care project in their community as well as to promote awareness of women's heart disease. Collegiate chapters of Alpha Phi host a philanthropy event known as The Red Dress Gala (also called \\"Red Dress Ball\\" or \\"Aphiasco\\" by some chapters), which includes a silent auction, guest speakers, and a full dinner for sisters, alumni, and family. Traditionally, the collegiate members wear red dresses to represent their support for Women's Heart Health. This event raises funds for their Foundation and the Heart to Heart Grant. Collegiate chapters, alumnae chapters and individual members can nominate a local heart project for the Heart to Heart Cardiac Care Grant. Self-nominations are also accepted.

In October 2016, the Iota Delta chapter at the University of Rhode Island charter was revoked for at least four years. On bid day, the sorority was accused of endangering the health and safety of new members and violating the university's alcohol policy.http://www.providencejournal.com/news/20161031/uri-revokes-sororitys- charter-following-alcohol-violation In January 2018, Harley Barber, a member of the Beta Mu chapter at the University of Alabama was terminated from the sorority and expelled from the college after posting videos on social media in which she repeatedly used the n-word and other profanities to make degrading comments about African-Americans. The incident gained media coverage across the country, University President Stuart R. Bell, the University Panhellenic Association, and Linda Kahangi, executive director of Alpha Phi International Fraternity released statements. In January 2018, three members of the Iota Iota chapter at the George Washington University were removed from the organization due to a racist social media post. The incident prompted criticism from national and international news sources and the University's Student Association received petitions to remove the chapter from campus. In September 2018, a document by a former recruitment chair of the University of Michigan Alpha Phi chapter surfaced with descriptions of how the chapter's membership selection process was based on selecting for certain physical appearances and assigned numbers to these women based on the judgment of the recruitment chairs and representatives from their international headquarters. The expos√© described that Alpha Phi supervisors ordered her to give the PNMs an \\"External Prescore\\" based on pictures from their social media profiles. Throughout the recruitment process, active members in the sorority were also ranked on superficial qualities and matched with \\"stronger\\" or \\"weaker\\" PNMs. In January 2019, the Alpha Phi chapter at Old Dominion University was accused of racist behavior within the members of the sorority. School officials are investigating the allegations and the chapter cannot currently hold functions of any kind at this time.

He also founded the automotive company Panther Westwinds.  Early life  Born in London in 1938, Jankel was educated at St Paul's School and studied engineering at Chelsea College. He was an avid sportsman and a member of the St Paul's rowing team. Jankel built his first car in 1954: a wrecked Austin 7 which he rebuilt and customised. After an unsuccessful attempt at selling cars he agreed to join the family fashion business, Goldenfelds. During his time as a fashion designer, he still worked on cars, including a classic 1930 Rolls-Royce, which he completely rebuilt in 1970. On a trip to Spain, a bullfighter offered Jankel ¬£10,000 for the Rolls-Royce. It was this sale that inspired Jankel to found an automobile company. Jankel married Jennifer Loss, daughter of bandleader Joe Loss, in 1962. The couple had three sons and a daughter.  Panther Westwinds  In 1972, Jankel left the fashion industry to found motor company Panther Westwinds in Weybridge, Surrey, England. The company was named \\"Panther\\" because of its similarity to Jaguar and \\"Westwinds\\" after the Jankel family's home. The company's first car, a prototype two-seater called the Panther J72, was powered by a Jaguar engine and modelled after the Jaguar SS100. Although the asking price for the J72 was around twice that of contemporary Jaguar models, magazine advertisements generated enough interest for Jankel to produce one J72 a week during the car's production. Roughly 500 were produced. In 1974, Jankel produced the Panther De Ville, powered by a Jaguar engine and modelled after the Bugatti Royale. The De Ville cost twice as much as a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow, and only the wealthiest of collectors could afford it. The Panther Rio, launched after one year, was based on the Triumph Dolomite. The luxurious saloon cost three times as much as a Dolomite, however, and only 38 were produced. The Panther 6, a two-seater roadster outfitted with six wheels, followed in 1977, but because of its high cost, unconventional design and relative obscurity, only two were produced one black and one white both cars made with powerful Cadillac V8 Turbocharged engine. Jankel's most successful vehicle was the Panther Lima. The Lima was styled like a 1930s roadster but used modern fibreglass technology for the body, which was built around a steel framework and chassis. More than 1,000 of the two marks of this popular model were built.  The Jankel Group  Jankel Armouring logo Despite the success of the Lima, Panther Westwind went bankrupt in 1979, and it was subsequently sold to South Korean businessman Young Kim. Jankel then turned his focus to the Jankel Group, a coachbuilding company he had founded in 1955 but the firm had been little more than a hobby. For the Jankel Group, Jankel concentrated on building specialist versions of cars for other high-end manufacturers, mostly Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar. From 1983 to 1989, Jankel was the exclusive subcontractor to Rolls- Royce to build more than 100 units of the Silver Spur Limousine. For Range Rover, he built a number of specialist hunting and all-terrain vehicles for Middle Eastern customers. In 1992 he built the Jankel Tempest, a Chevrolet Corvette-based super car, with ultra-luxury interior and 6.7 litre supercharged V8, which produced 535bhp and was capable of 200mph, as well as holding the 1992 Guinness Book of Records 0-60mph acceleration record of 3.89 seconds. Most of Jankel's work from the 1990s to his death in 2005 was dedicated to building police vehicles, high-protection armoured cars and exotic luxury stretch limousines. In 1995, Jankel produced armoured cars for law enforcement agencies, including the Metropolitan Police. All of Jankel's police vehicles were built on GM and Ford chassis. Jankel bought back the Panther name in 2001 and was working on a new Panther sports car when he died. Jankel was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2001, but remained an active member of the Jankel Group until his death on 25 May 2005. The Jankel Group continues to build made-to-order speciality vehicles to this day.

The two Earp brothers had been attacked in retaliation for the deaths of three Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. From March 20 to April 15, 1882, the federal posse searched southeast Cochise County, Arizona Territory for the men they believed were responsible for the attacks on Virgil and Morgan. Several suspects had been identified and were charged, but were soon released by the court, owing in some cases to legal technicalities and in others to the strength of alibis provided by Cowboy confederates. Wyatt hoped that the legal system would bring the Cowboys to justice, but after suspects in both ambushes were freed, Wyatt resolved to take matters into his own hands. On March 20, two days after Morgan's murder, Wyatt, his brothers Warren and James, Doc Holliday, and two other deputies were escorting Virgil and his wife Allie to a California-bound train in Tucson. They learned that suspects Ike Clanton and Frank Stilwell were already waiting there. After Virgil, Allie, and James boarded the train, Wyatt spotted two men near the train that he thought were Clanton and Stilwell. He and several men chased down and killed Stilwell, but lost the other. After Stilwell's body was found the next morning, the Tucson Justice of the Peace issued arrest warrants for the five lawmen suspected of the extra- judicial murder. When the men returned to Tombstone, Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan had received a telegram notifying him of the Tucson warrants, and attempted to detain the five members of Earp's federal posse named in the warrants, but they ignored him. Still carrying arrest warrants for Curly Bill Brocius and others, they left Tombstone to pursue further Cowboys implicated in the attacks. Behan formed a Cochise County sheriff's posse consisting of deputies Phineas Clanton, Johnny Ringo, and about twenty other Cowboys and Arizona ranchers. Based on the local warrants, they followed the Earp posse and set out to arrest them. The large sheriff's posse came close to, but never engaged, the much smaller Earp posse, which received help from local businessmen and ranchers (and at one point, published a letter in a Tombstone newspaper taunting Behan and his men). The federal posse ultimately killed four men, starting with Stilwell and ending with Brocius. About April 15 the Earps and some of their associates rode out of Arizona Territory, headed for New Mexico Territory.  Background  After a long-simmering feud and increasing animosity and threats, Tombstone town Marshal Virgil Earp, Assistant Town Marshal Morgan Earp, and temporary deputy marshals Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday confronted outlaw Cowboys Billy Claiborne, Ike and Billy Clanton, and Tom and Frank McLaury in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral on October 26, 1881. The 30-second gunfight is generally regarded as the most famous gunfight in the history of the American Wild West. The lawmen killed three of the Cowboys during the gunfight. Ike Clanton filed murder charges, and after a month-long preliminary hearing, Justice of the Peace Wells Spicer found that the lawmen had acted within their duty. But Spicer's finding did not end the matter for Clanton and other Cowboys. = Attempted murder of Virgil Earp = At about 11:30 pm on December 28, 1881, just over two months after the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, three men ambushed Virgil Earp as he walked from Schieffelin Hall back to the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where the Earps had moved for mutual support and protection. He was hit in the back and upper left arm by about 20 buckshot pellets, shattering his humerus. Dr. George Goodfellow, who treated him, had to remove of bone. Wyatt telegraphed U.S. Marshal Crawley Dake. He requested appointment as Deputy U.S. Marshal for eastern Pima County and authority to form a posse. Commenting on Earp's request to Dake, the Weekly Arizona Miner wrote on December 30, 1881 about the repeated threats received by the Earps and others. = Wyatt deputizes posse = Dake replied affirmatively by telegraph, and Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp deputized Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, Jack \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson, Charlie \\"Hairlip Charlie\\" Smith, Daniel \\"Tip\\" Tipton, and John \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion to protect the family and pursue the suspects, paying them $5 a day. McMaster and Johnson were known as tough men who knew how to use their guns. McMaster had seen service with the Texas Rangers in 1878-1879 when his unit captured and held Curly Bill Brocius prisoner for five months. In Tombstone, McMaster had also been accused of stealing U.S. Army mules and robbing a stage with outlaw Charles \\"Pony\\" Diehl. Fluent in Spanish, McMaster used his inside knowledge of the Cowboys to assist the Earps in their search. He also liked fine horses. Jack \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson, whose real name according to Wyatt Earp was John William Blount, was a native of Missouri who was raised in the lead mining area near Neosho. Blount was forced to flee Missouri in 1877 after he and his brother were involved in a violent street battle. During May 1881, his brother Bud killed a man in a quarrel in Tip Top, Arizona Territory, and was sent to Yuma Territorial Prison. John Blount adopted the alias Jack Johnson and went to Tombstone seeking Wyatt Earp's help to get his brother pardoned. Wyatt helped by writing a petition to Governor Fremont, whom Wyatt knew, and Bud Blount was eventually freed. As a way to repay his debt, Johnson joined the posse. Charlie Smith had a long-time connection to the Earp family, and was fluent in Spanish after spending several years in Texas working in saloons. While in Fort Worth he had been associated with barman James Earp, and participated in at least two gunfights there, and was seriously wounded in 1878. Arriving in Tombstone in 1879 with Robert J. Winders, Smith immediately became associated with the Earps. Winders and the Earps partnered on the Mountain Maid mine. Daniel \\"Tip\\" Tipton arrived in Tombstone in March 1881\\\\. He had a shady reputation earned during the early days of the mining boom in Virginia City, Nevada Territory. Tipton, a former Union seaman in the Civil War, was tattooed on his hands and forearms, and took up mining and gambling after the war. In 1879 he was in the Gunnison district of Colorado before traveling to Tombstone at the request of his friend Lou Rickabaugh, also a friend of the Earps. Smith and Tipton were gamblers who supplemented their income with mining ventures. John \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion, a Virginian, joined the vendetta ride after Frank Stilwell was killed, and was never indicted for Stilwell's murder, but he was with the Earps when Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz was killed. Although closer to friend and fellow Southerner Doc Holliday than the Earps, Vermillion remained by Wyatt Earp's side during the shootout at Iron Springs with Curly Bill Brocius. A veteran of the Civil War on the Confederate side who rode with J.E.B. Stuart's Virginia cavalry, Vermillion was an accomplished horseman and pistoleer. U.S. Marshal Dake visited Tombstone in late January 1881 with acting Governor John J. Gosper. Dake had previously and unsuccessfully requested financial assistance from the United States Attorney General, Wayne McVeagh, to help track down and arrest the Cowboys. Dake's superior told him he must reduce his official debt below the penalty bond of $20,000 before an additional appropriation could be made. In September 1881, Governor Gosper told Secretary of Interior Kirkwood that Arizona contained \\"a small army of outlaws well armed and fully able to cope with the ordinary civil powers of our counties.\\" Not believing that the federal bureaucracy would provide funds, Dake borrowed $3,000 from Wells Fargo & Co., promising that the Department of Justice would repay it. He deposited money, variously reported as either $300 or $3000, to an account in the Hudson & Company Bank, minus $15, for use \\"to arrest all parties committing crimes against the United States.\\" The following day John Thacker from Wells Fargo went with Wyatt to the bank to authorize his use of the funds. Dake was later accused, although not convicted, of spending $300 on gambling and prostitutes while in Tombstone and misappropriating most of the rest of the money. = Outlaw Cowboy warrants = In January 1882, Wyatt Earp sought and received warrants from Judge William H. Stilwell for the arrest of the men thought responsible for ambushing Virgil. Judge Stilwell was among a number of Cochise County citizens unhappy with Sheriff Behan's failure to stop the Cowboys' ongoing criminal activity. On January 17, 1882, Johnny Ringo and Doc Holliday had traded threats, resulting in their arrest by Tombstone's chief of police, James Flynn. Both were fined and Judge Stilwell noted that charges were still outstanding against Ringo for a robbery in Galeyville. Ringo was rearrested and jailed on January 20. On January 23, Wyatt rode with his deputized posse, consisting of his brothers Morgan and Warren, Doc Holliday, \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion and four others, to Charleston, Arizona where Ike Clanton, his brother Phin, and Pony Diehl were known to stay. Ringo, still in jail, learned that the Earps had warrants and were headed for Charleston. He arranged for bail and Sheriff Behan released him before the bail payment arrived. James Earp immediately filed an affidavit saying Ringo was \\"an escaped prisoner\\" and charged that Ringo intended to interfere with Wyatt's execution of the warrants. Ringo immediately rode to Charleston to warn his Cowboy friends. On the way to Charleston, Earp's posse was joined by 30 more riders from Tombstone. They found Ben Maynard, a known Cowboy associate, outside Charleston and arrested him. With Maynard in front, the posse took over the small town and went door-to-door looking for the Clantons and Diehl. Ringo was rearrested in Charleston, but not before he warned the Clantons and Diehl, who left town. The next day the posse scouted the countryside, eventually stopping at a camp near Tombstone known as \\"Pick- em-up\\". Complicating matters, a Tombstone deputy sheriff rode out to Pick-em- up and served a warrant on McMaster, who was accused of stealing two horses from the Contention mine. The Earp posse rode back into Tombstone where Sherman McMaster made bail. He and Charlie Smith took a room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel near the Earps. On January 30, Ike and Phin Clanton surrendered to Wells Fargo agent Charley Bartholomew and were jailed in Tombstone. They learned that the warrant was not for armed robbery as they thought, but for \\"assault with intent to commit murder, the specific offense being the waylaying and shooting of Virgil Earp some weeks ago.\\" On February 2, the Clantons were tried before Judge Stilwell. Ike's hat had been found at the scene and McMaster testified that he had heard Ike talk about the shooting in Charleston later that evening. He said that when Ike learned that Virgil had survived the shooting, Ike said he \\"would have to go back and do the job over.\\" However, Charleston constable George McKelvey, saloon owner J. B. Ayers, and five others testified that Ike Clanton had been in Charleston and could not have taken part in the shooting. The charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. Wyatt said later that Judge Stilwell told him, \\"Wyatt, you'll never clean up this crowd this way; next time you'd better leave your prisoners in the brush where alibis don't count.\\" Ike Clanton refiled murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday in Contention, Arizona for their killing of his brother and the McLaury brothers. When he could not provide new evidence, the charges were dismissed. On February 13, Wyatt mortgaged his home to lawyer James G. Howard for $365.00 (about $ today), but was never able to repay the loan and in 1884 Howard foreclosed on the house. On February 17, the Earp posse left Tombstone heavily armed and with a warrant for the arrest of \\"Pony\\" Diehl, who was suspected in a January 1882 stage robbery. Unsuccessful, they returned to town a few days later, hearing rumors that the Cowboys were plotting further revenge. = Morgan Earp assassinated = The Longhorn Restaurant is located in what used to be the Bucket of Blood Saloon, the Holiday Water Company, and the Owl Cafe and Hotel. Virgil Earp was shot from the second floor while the building was under construction.Longhorn Restaurant Accessdate: October 17, 2014 On Saturday evening, March 18, 1882, Tombstone's Scheifflin Hall was host to Stolen Kisses, a play by William Horace Lingard and Company. Despite having received death threats earlier that day, Morgan, Doc Holliday, and Dan Tipton attended. Wyatt and Benjamin Goodrich cautioned against attending. Afterward, Doc went to his room and Morgan and Tipton headed for Hatch's Saloon and Billiard Parlor, which had become their unofficial headquarters after the Oriental Hotel was sold. Morgan and Bob Hatch began a game of pool and Wyatt, Tipton, and McMaster watched. The table was near the back door. At 10:50 pm, someone fired two shots through the window of the back door. One bullet passed through Morgan, shattered his spine, and then lodged in the thigh of George A. B. Berry. Another bullet struck the wall over Wyatt's head. Wyatt, McMaster and Tipton pulled Morgan out of the line of fire while Hatch dashed outside looking for the shooters. Morgan died within the hour. = Cowboy suspects identified = While Wyatt and James were traveling to Contention with Morgan's body, Coroner Dr. D.M. Mathew held an inquest into Morgan's death. During the Coroner's Inquest, Pete Spence's wife, Marietta Duarte, implicated her husband and four other men in Morgan's murder. She testified that along with her husband, Frank Stilwell, a man named \\"Fries\\" (later identified as Frederick Bode), and two Indians (later identified as Hank Swilling and Florentino Cruz) took part in the killing. She testified that four days before the shooting she and her mother were standing at Spence's house when Morgan walked by. \\"The Indian then started down the street, & got ahead of him to get a good look at him.\\" She also stated that on the night of the shooting she and her mother heard the shots, and a few minutes later Stilwell and \\"Indian Charley\\" came into her home, followed shortly by Spence, Bode and the other Indian. Marietta Duarte recalled that the men were excited, and the next morning her husband threatened her with violence if she told what she knew. \\"Spence didn't tell me so, but I know he killed Morgan Earp\\", she said. Additional witnesses said they saw Frank Stilwell running from the scene. Like the gunfight three months earlier, Morgan's murder was national news. The Angeles Herald reported:The Tombstone Vendetta More Startling Discoveries The Angeles Herald March 28, 1882 Volume 18, Number 28 The coroner's jury concluded that Spence, Stilwell, Fries, and \\"two half-breed Indians\\" were responsible for Morgan's murder. = Suspects in jail = Unknown to Wyatt, three of the Cowboys he sought were in Behan's jail. After the Coroner's Jury ended, Spence immediately turned himself in, protected in Behan's jail. On the day of the inquest, two of Behan's deputy sheriffs arrested two more suspects for other reasons. Cochise County Deputy Sheriff William Bell brought Indian Charlie from Charleston and placed him under arrest in the Tombstone jail for shooting a man in Charleston. Separately, Cochise County Deputy Sheriff Frank Hereford arrested \\"John Doe\\" Freeze. They were all later released. = Wyatt seeks revenge = When Wyatt Earp learned of the judge's ruling, he felt he could not rely on the court system for justice. Stilwell had previously been acquitted of two homicides and a stage robbery, and in Wyatt Earp's opinion, he and other Cowboys had gotten away with murder again. Wyatt decided to take matters into his own hands‚Äîconcluding that the only way to deal with Virgil's and Morgan's attackers, and the continued threat against the entire Earp family, was to kill the responsible Cowboys.  Stilwell shooting in Tucson  On Sunday, March 19, the day after Morgan's murder, Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp, his brother James, and a group of friends prepared to accompany Virgil and his wife, along with Morgan's body, to the rail head in Benson. From there James would accompany them to the family home in Colton, California. Morgan's wife and parents waited to bury him. = Earp assembles deputies = On Monday, Wyatt received information that Frank Stilwell, Ike Clanton, Hank Swilling, and another cowboy were watching the passenger trains in Tucson intending to kill Virgil Earp. He thought getting the still invalid Virgil through to Tucson safely would require extra help. Wyatt, accompanied by Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Jack Johnson, and Sherman McMaster, guarded Virgil and Allie. In Contention City they stabled their horses and picked up an extra wagon. They rode in the wagon to the rail head in Benson, where they caught the next train to Tucson. They were all heavily armed with shotguns or rifles, except Virgil who had a pistol. Nathan W. Waite of Ash Canyon in the Huachuca Mountains was on the train with the Earp party. He said the Earp men were all armed and McMaster was wearing two cartridge belts. = Cowboys in Tucson = In Tucson, the party was greeted at the train station by Deputy U.S. Marshal Joseph W. Evans. Virgil and other witnesses later reported that they saw Stilwell, Ike Clanton, and other Cowboys at the train station. \\"Almost the first men we met on the platform there were Stilwell and his friends, armed to the teeth\\", Virgil later told the San Francisco Examiner. \\"They fell back into the crowd as soon as they saw I had an escort, and the boys took me to the hotel to supper.\\" Watched over by the well-armed Wyatt and his posse, Virgil and Allie had dinner in Tucson at Porter's Hotel. Marshal Evans saw Holliday deposit two shotguns at the railroad station office. Tucson in 1880. = Stilwell killed = After the Earp group finished dinner at Porter's Hotel they returned to the train. Holliday asked someone to get his shotguns. Wyatt escorted Virgil and Allie aboard the train. A passenger told Virgil he saw men lying on a flatcar near the engine. Wyatt saw them too and slipped between the tracks, looking for the men. As the train pulled away from the Tucson station at about 7:15 p.m., six or seven shots were heard. Witnesses gave differing accounts but Frank Stilwell's body was found on the morning of March 21 about from the Porter Hotel alongside the tracks riddled with two buckshot and three gunshot wounds. George Hand, who saw the body, said Stilwell was \\"the worst shot up man I ever saw.\\" = Stilwell's wounds = Coroner Dr. Dexter Lyford found a single bullet wound through Stilwell's body under his armpits; a wound from a rifle through the upper left arm; a buckshot wound that passed through the liver, abdomen, and stomach; another buckshot wound that fractured his left leg; and a rifle wound through the right leg. The coroner concluded that Stilwell had been shot by five different weapons. Either the gun shot under his arm or through the abdomen could have been the cause of death. The Tombstone Epitaph reported the next day that Stilwell had been shot six times. They reported that the round of buckshot in the torso had struck him at such close range that six buckshot left holes within a radius of , leaving powder burns on his coat. Many years later, Wyatt told his biographer Flood that he and his party had seen Clanton and Stilwell on the tracks with weapons, and he had shot Stilwell. The federal deputies looked hard for another man, whom Wyatt identified as Ike Clanton, but he got away. Ike claimed in a newspaper interview afterward that he and Stilwell had been in Tucson to respond to a federal subpoena for interfering with a U.S. mail carrier when he allegedly robbed the Sandy Bob line of the Bisbee stage on September 8, 1881. The federal charges had been filed by Virgil Earp after Stilwell was acquitted for lack of evidence on the state charges of robbery. Clanton said he had heard that the Earps were coming in on a train to kill Stilwell. According to Clanton, Stilwell left the hotel and was last seen walking down the railroad tracks away from the Porter Hotel, towards where his body was later found on the tracks. Virgil later told the Examiner, \\"One thing is certain, if I had been without an escort they would have killed me.\\" The next day, the newspapers were full of news about Frank Stilwell's death. The Arizona Star reported, The Coroner's Jury in Tucson found that Stilwell had died at the hands of Wyatt and Warren Earp, Holliday, McMaster, and Johnson. Tucson Justice of the Peace Charles Meyer issued arrest warrants for the five men.  Earp posse pursues Outlaw Cowboys  Tombstone in 1881 On the night of March 20, after killing Stilwell in Tucson, and verifying that the train was on its way to California with the rest of their family, the Earp party was afoot. They walked southeast back along the Southern Pacific tracks out of Tucson to the Papago freight stop. (The station was later renamed Esmond and was the site of a head-on train crash in 1903 at the current location of the Desert Sky Middle School in Tucson.) At the Papago stop they flagged down the night- freight train back to the terminal in Benson. Once in Benson they hired a wagon back to Contention where they picked up their stabled horses. They rode into Tombstone around 11:00 a.m. on Tuesday, March 21\\\\. Once in Tombstone they learned of Marietta Duarte's testimony during the coroner's inquest into Morgan's death. She told the jury that her husband Pete Spence and several others who she identified had talked about the murder in her home. The Earps returned to their rooms upstairs at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, where they had lived in close company and used as their temporary headquarters since the first attack on Virgil in December. Wyatt and Warren Earp, J.H. Holliday, Texas Jack, \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson, and Sherman McMaster were now wanted men due to the outstanding warrants. Tucson, where the Earps had killed Stilwell, was in the jurisdiction of Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul, a friend of the Earps. He and District Attorney Alex Campbell sent a telegram to Behan in Tombstone asking him to arrest the Earps. The telegraph office manager was a friend to the Earps and showed the message to Wyatt before it was delivered to Behan. The operator agreed to delay delivering the message to Behan long enough to allow the Earps and their associates to make ready to leave town Tuesday evening. The Earps sent instructions to Montgomery's stable to get their horses saddled. John \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion Early in the evening Behan received the delayed telegram. He gathered his deputies and Tombstone City Marshal Dave Neagle. They met in front of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, preparing to arrest the five men. Behan encountered the heavily armed Earp lawmen as they passed through the lobby of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, getting ready to pick up their horses from the stable and leave town. Cochise County Sheriff Behan told the Deputy U.S. Marshal, \\"Wyatt I want to see you.\\" Wyatt replied without stopping, \\"Johnny, if you're not careful, you'll see me once too often.\\" The Tombstone Epitaph reported, \\"The Sheriff made a weak attempt to arrest them at the Cosmopolitan Hotel before they left, but Wyatt Earp told him he didn't want see him; that he had seen him once too often, and thereupon the Earp party mounted their horses and rode away.\\". One of Behan's deputies, Billy Breakenridge, claimed Wyatt and his men resisted arrest and even pulled their guns on Behan and Dave Neagle, one of Wyatt's friends, to prevent their arrest. In a story published on May 14, 1893, Wyatt told a reporter for the Denver Republican: Wyatt and Warren Earp, Doc Holliday, Johnson and McMaster were joined by \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion, Dan Tipton, Charlie Smith, Fred Dodge, Johnny Green, and Louis Cooley to form a federal posse under Wyatt's authority as the Deputy US Marshal. Continuing to ignore Behan, the Earp posse rode out of town the same evening of Tuesday, March 21. The next morning Behan formed a posse consisting of a number of deputized Cowboys, friends of Frank Stilwell and Ike Clanton, including Johnny Ringo, Phineas Clanton, Johnny Barnes and about 18 more men. They rode after the federal posse and the five men wanted for Stilwell's murder. Paul was on his way to Tombstone the next day when he ran into Behan and his posse on the road outside of town. He joined the posse and rode with them to Contention that night and on to Tombstone the next day. Without sleep for two days, Paul told Behan to wake him if he got news of the Earp's location, but Behan left without him. In 1898, Paul wrote the Tucson Republican that the Earps had spied Stillwell \\"standing on a gravel car peeking into the window of the car that Virgil Earp was in.\\" = Killing of Florentino Cruz = The Dragoon Mountains, from the south. On the morning of March 22, a portion of the Earp posse including Wyatt, Warren, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster and \\"Turkey Creek\\" Johnson rode about east to Pete Spence's ranch and woodcutting camp off the Chiricahua Road, below the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains. According to Theodore Judah, who witnessed events at the wood camp, the Earp posse arrived around 11:00 am and asked him about the location of Pete Spence and Florentino \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz. He told them Spence was in jail in Tombstone and that Cruz was cutting wood nearby. They followed the direction Judah indicated and Judah soon heard ten or twelve shots fired. Judah looked for Cruz that night without success. The next morning he went looking for him again and found his body full of bullet holes. One apocryphal account says that after the party recognized Cruz, they chased him down and a gunfight ensued. The party managed to capture a fatally wounded Cruz and he confessed to have taken part in Morgan's murder, and that he identified Stilwell, Hank Swilling, Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo as the others who killed Morgan. During that time, in Wyatt's own account, he allowed Cruz to keep his revolver in his holster to \\"give him a chance to fight like a man\\". After Cruz's confession, Wyatt gave him the permission to draw his revolver, which Cruz did, but Wyatt managed to draw his gun first and killed him with one shot. Wyatt's account of him killing Cruz in a duel is contradicted by Cruz' fatal wounds, one to the temple and the second through his right side.Roberts, Gary L. (2006). Doc Holliday: The Life and Legend. John Wiley and Sons, Inc. cit. 106. = Behan arrests two = On Thursday, March 23, Smith and Tipton left the main body of the posse to obtain information and money in Tombstone. The rest of the posse rode west about and on the night of March 23 stayed in a campsite northwest of Tombstone, between Contention and Drew‚Äôs Station. Behan saw Smith and Tipton in town and arrested them for \\"resisting arrest and conspiracy.\\" The men immediately paid their bond. Smith left Tombstone to rejoin the federal posse but Tipton remained behind. When Smith rejoined the group, Earp asked him to return to town and raise $1,000 to cover the posse's expense. Earp later said he told Smith, ‚ÄúMeet us at Iron Springs, and don‚Äôt lose any time. We‚Äôll be waiting there.‚Äù On March 27 Smith and Tipton were brought before Judge A.J. Felter in Tombstone. The defense asked the judge to dismiss the charges because Behan lacked a warrant and the judge agreed, freeing the men. = Cruz autopsy = The Arizona Weekly Star had previously identified \\"Florentino Saiz\\" as \\"the 1878 murderer of Deputy U.S. Marshals Cornelius Finley and John Hicks Adams on September 2, 1878, and Cruz and Saiz may have been the same person. On Friday, March 24 in Tombstone, Dr. George Goodfellow, acting as coroner, examined Cruz's body. At the coroner's inquest, Goodfellow testified that he found four wounds in Cruz: one shot through his right temple entering the brain; a \\"slight flesh wound to the right shoulder\\"; a third entering his right side and exiting to the right of his spine; and the fourth hitting him in the left thigh and exiting \\"seven or eight inches above the point of entry.\\" He stated that either the first or third wound were sufficient to cause death. The coroner's jury ruled that Cruz had been killed by Wyatt and Warren Earp, Sherman McMaster, Jack Johnson, Doc Holliday, Texas Jack and two other unnamed gunmen (Dan Tipton and Charlie Smith). On the day of the inquest, Arizona Territory Governor Tritle arrived in Tombstone to look into the \\"sad state of affairs here.\\" On the same day, the two remaining members of the Earp family departed Tombstone. The Tombstone Epitaph reported that both James Earp's wife Bessie and Wyatt's common-law wife Mattie were departing for Colton, California, where the rest of the Earp family had moved. = Gunfight with Curly Bill = In 1919, with the help of John Flood, Wyatt Earp drew a map showing the location of Iron Springs. The Whetstone Mountains On Friday, March 24, the Earp posse, including Wyatt, Warren, Doc Holliday, Sherman McMaster, and Texas Jack, rode west about from their overnight campsite about halfway between Contention and Drew's Station. The federal posse rode westerly up a wash towards a prearranged meeting place at a springs, where they expected to meet Smith, who was to bring $1000 from Tombstone, about to the east. The springs were identified by Wyatt Earp as \\"Iron Springs,\\" but the location was reported the next day by The Tombstone Epitaph as \\"Burleigh Springs\\", about south of Tombstone and east of Charleston. The spring was located in the Whetstone Mountains west of Tombstone and was later renamed Mescal Springs. Lot Number: 43400 Some modern researchers believe it is actually Cottonwood Springs. The actual location is uncertain. With Wyatt and Doc Holliday in the lead, the six lawmen surmounted a small rise overlooking the springs and were surprised to find nine Cowboys already there: Curly Bill, Pony Diehl, Johnny Barnes, Frank Patterson, Milt Hicks, Bill Hicks, Bill Johnson, Ed Lyle, and Johnny Lyle. They were camped about the springs, cooking a meal, less than down an slight embankment. Once again, the odds were not in the lawmen's favor. = Curly Bill's death = Recognizing Earp, Curly Bill fired his shotgun without warning at Wyatt but missed. Eighteen months earlier, Wyatt had protected Curly Bill against a mob ready to lynch him for killing Tombstone Town Marshal Fred White, and then provided testimony that helped spare Curly Bill from a murder trial. Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday wrote about the fight, and Fred Dodge interviewed three participants afterward. Earp dismounted, carrying a 22-inch, 10-gauge stagecoach shotgun he had borrowed from Fred Dodge. The other Cowboys fired at the lawmen. \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion‚Äôs horse was killed and fell on him, pinning his leg. Vermillion was unable to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse. Doc Holliday pulled Vermillion from under his horse, and they, Johnson and McMaster shot at the Cowboys as they sought cover. Wyatt returned fire across his horse with his own shotgun and hit Curly Bill in the chest, almost cutting him in half. Curly Bill fell into the water by the edge of the spring and lay dead. The lawmen's fire was so intense that, according to Johnny Barnes, the Cowboys who could, \\"got away.\\" After killing Brocius, Earp fired his pistol and shot Johnny Barnes in the chest and Milt Hicks in the arm. Attempting to remount his horse, Wyatt had trouble getting up into the saddle because his cartridge belt had slipped down around his thighs. He was finally able to get on his horse and retreat. = Wyatt unhurt = The Cowboys fired a number of shots at the Earp party without effect. McMaster was grazed by a bullet that cut through the straps of his field glasses or possibly his coat. Later accounts of the gun fight varied. Wyatt reported that his long coat was punctured by bullets or buck shot on both sides. Another bullet struck his boot heel and his saddle-horn was hit as well, burning the saddle hide and narrowly missing Wyatt. In his unpublished 1926 biography of Earp, John H. Flood wrote, Ed Colburn wrote in a letter published in the Ford County Globe on May 23, 1882 that he had visited with Wyatt and Warren Earp in Gunnison, Colorado. In the letter he relayed Earp's story about how his overcoat was hit on both sides of his body by a charge of buckshot and that his saddle horn was shot off. The Tombstone Epitaph reported on March 27 that Wyatt \\"received seven shots through his clothes,\\" and that McMaster's clothing was shot through once, that Texas Jack's horse had been killed, and the pommel of Wyatt's saddle had been shot off. Flood described Vermillion several times as being a relative stranger to the Earps, although he had been one of Virgil's city deputies. Wyatt was reportedly impressed by Vermillion's steadfastness in helping to avenge his brothers. = Curly Bill death refuted = The Epitaph reported that Curly Bill had been killed, though they noted the repeated denials by the Cowboys. Dick Wright and Tony Kraker insisted they had seen the Cowboys near Drew's Ranch below Contention, who had reported that they had shot the pommel off Wyatt's horse, and he had shot at them without effect. Wyatt told Flood that Brocius's friends buried Curly Bill on the Patterson ranch near the Babocomari River. Frank Patterson was a member of the Cowboy party, and his ranch was close to the original McLaury ranch site. The McLaurys moved their operation to Sulphur Springs Valley in late 1880. The Patterson ranch is believed to have originally belonged to Frank Stilwell and was located on the Babocomari River about west of Fairbank. An unknown individual who claimed to be on his way to meet the Earp posse, possibly Kraker or Wright, wrote the Tombstone Nugget on March 26 that they had seen a wagon arrive and carry Curly Bill's body away. Rancher Henry Hooker wrote that Wells Fargo agent John Thacker, himself, went to the place where Curly Bill had been buried and had the body dug up. Thacker identified Curly Bill's body, and saw that it was reinterred.\\" Johnny Barnes recovered somewhat after the shooting but later died of his wound. Wells, Fargo & Co. undercover agent Fred Dodge, riding with the Cowboys, wrote that Barnes had told him that he had shot Virgil Earp. Dodge also wrote in the 1920s that Barnes had told him that Wyatt Earp had killed Brocius.  Prominent businessman murdered  Representing the danger of the Cowboys to business owners and citizens, on Saturday evening, March 25, Martin R. Peel of the Tombstone Milling and Mining Company near Charleston was murdered by two masked men. They simply walked in on the mill superintendent, Peel, and two other men, who were socializing. They entered with their rifles raised and without saying a word, the first man fired a shot into Peel's chest, killing him instantly. The second man fired a shot at W. L. Austin, who ducked behind a counter and was not hit. Peel was shot through the heart at such close range that his clothing was set on fire. No attempt at robbery was made. The others in the room with him when he was attacked ducked. No motive could be established and the assailants, wearing scarves over the faces, could not be identified. They were assisted by a third man who held their horses only a few hundred feet away. The crime sent reverberations through Tombstone and Cochise County. Peel's father, respected Judge Bryant L. Peel, sent an open letter to The Tombstone Epitaph stating that the citizens needed to take the law into their own hands. = Cowboy suspects freed = On Saturday, March 25, the Tucson Grand Jury indicted Pete Spence, Frank Stilwell, Florentino Cruz, Frederick Bode, and \\"John Doe\\" (Fries) for Morgan Earp's murder. Pete Spence's trial began on April 2, but ended on April 5 when the prosecution called Marietta Spence to repeat the testimony she had given at the Coroner's Inquest. The defense objected that her testimony was hearsay and that as a spouse she could not testify against her husband. Without her testimony, the prosecution had insufficient evidence. They dropped its case against Spence and Bode and the court dismissed the charges. = Earp posse pursued by Behan posse = On the same day, the Earp party arrived from Iron Springs to an area outside Tombstone and met with supporters, including Charlie Smith and Dan Tipton. They were hoping to receive $1,000 contributed by mining owner and Earp supporter E.B. Gage from Smith, but after Smith was arrested by Behan, Tony Kraker and \\"Whistling Dick\\" Wright were chosen to carry it, and they had not returned. Gage had meanwhile learned of his mother's death and had left town for the east coast. Later that day the Earp party rode north towards Henderson Ranch near where they ate and fed their horses. Cochise County Deputy Sheriff Frank Hereford was at the ranch but didn't show himself in fear of his safety, although the Earp party had only \\"the greatest respect\\" for him. On March 25, Sheriff Behan formed a posse that included known criminals including Johnny Ringo, Phin Clanton and Johnny Barnes. The 25-man posse left Tombstone and searched east of town for the Earp posse for a while before turning back for the night. At around 6:30 a.m. the next day, Behan led a 15-man posse from Tombstone, headed for the Dragoon Mountains, and they returned that night. The Earp posse camped Sunday night, March 26 a mile north of Henderson Ranch and left at 7:00 a.m. the next day for the Sierra Bonita Ranch of Henry C. Hooker, a wealthy and prominent rancher. On April 5 The Tombstone Epitaph printed a letter from an unknown member of the Earp party that recited some of the group's actions after leaving Tombstone and revealed that they were still in the area. The writer said the Wyatt posse left Tombstone on the evening of March 25 and camped north of town. The next day they headed for Dragoon Summit Station where they awaited the train and a messenger. They stopped the eastbound train at 1 p.m. and searched the carriages but found nothing. It is not known what they were hoping to find. = Arrival at Hooker Ranch = When they arrived at Hooker's ranch, he congratulated Earp on killing Curly Bill Brocius. He fed the men and their mounts. When Behan's posse was spotted in the distance, Hooker suggested Wyatt make his stand there, but Wyatt moved into the hills about three miles distant near Reilly Hill. When Sheriff Behan and his posse arrived at the Sierra Bonita Ranch on Tuesday morning, March 28, at 7:00 a.m., Hooker refused to provide Behan any information and \\"damned the officers and the law they represented.\\" Upon payment, he provided Behan's posse and horses with food and water, but would not supply them with fresh horses. Behan and undersheriff Woods sought the assistance of Indian Scouts under the command of Colonel Biddle at Ft. Grant, but was unsuccessful, even upon offering a $500 reward for assistance. They rejoined the remainder of the posse who had lost the Earp's posse trail and went to Eureka Springs. Former Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul, who had been in Tombstone at the time and volunteered to ride with the Behan posse, wrote a letter to the Tucson Citizen on March 3, 1898 in response to an earlier story he said was full of errors. He said the Earp posse had told Hooker to tell Behan and his posse where they were camped. Hooker told Behan where the Earps were camped but the posse left in the opposite direction. The Nugget reported that the Behan posse did not return until Friday. Early that same morning, Dan Tipton arrived in Willcox on the morning train, rented a horse, and started north, presumably towards the Earp's location and carrying the $1,000 from E.B. Gage for the posse. The Nugget reported that Tipton left on the 5 o'clock stage to catch up with the party near Hooker's ranch. The Earp posse also received some money from Louis Cooley, a stage driver and an employee of Wells Fargo, who gave funds from the express company. On April 15, Cooley traveled to Contention and Benson on business for Wells Fargo, where he met General Superintendent J.J. Valentine. When he arrived in Willcox to complete his business, Behan was there to arrest him. Behan's warrant accused Cooley of \\"aiding and abetting the Earps.\\" The Tombstone Epitaph labeled the charges as \\"frivolous\\" and said a lawsuit would be filed against Behan. Judge Wells Spicer dismissed the charges. While the location of the federal posse led by Wyatt Earp was well-known to most members of the public, Behan's posse never caught up with them. For their vain effort to find and arrest Wyatt Earp and the other four charged in Stillwell's murder, Behan's 25 man posse was paid $5 per day plus $3 per day for horse care for the 10 days they were on the trail. The total bill to the county taxpayers was $2,070.70. = Earp posse leaves Arizona Territory = Wyatt Earp in Dodge City, June 1883, fifteen months after the vendetta ride. On April 3, The Tombstone Epitaph reported that the Earp posse had eaten breakfast in town on March 27, and had been spotted six days later on April 2 north of Hooker's ranch, and that the Albuquerque Journal and San Francisco Daily Report both reported on March 28 that the Earp party had already passed through Albuquerque. It also noted that Virgil Earp and his wife were in Los Angeles that week. The newspaper commented, \\"This is the wisest course they could pursue. Their lives were not safe for a moment in Tombstone, even if they gave themselves up to the authorities, for the sheriff is inimical to them, and they felt that in his hands they would be entirely at the mercy of the cowboys.\\" But on April 5, a member of the Earp party told The Tombstone Epitaph that they were still in the Arizona Territory. This anonymous member of the party reported that from Hooker's ranch they rode north to Eureka Springs where they camped for the night. They spotted the Behan posse from that location but avoided drawing their attention. They stayed near Cottonwood the next night, possibly a mill site near the southwest end of the Whetstone Mountains, from which they picked up the trail of fugitive Frank Jackson. The Tombstone Epitaph reported that he was wanted on a $2,500 reward. The Earp posse arrested Jackson on April 4 and turned him over to Detective Jack Duncan. On April 12, 1882, the Weekly Nugget reported that Wyatt and his fellow \\"fugitives\\" were camped in a canyon near the Sierra Bonita Ranch. Wyatt was quoted as publicly challenging Cochise County Sheriff Behan to come find him there. Sometime from April 10 to April 14, the group headed east out of Arizona. They stopped at Camp Grant before they left the Arizona Territory and Wyatt signed some property over to his sister. Colonel James Biddle told the Earps that warrants had been issued for their arrest and he would have to hold them. He invited them in for a meal. When they finished the meal, they found fresh horses ready for them to continue their ride east. They rode east again the next day and on April 15, 1882, stopped in Silver City, New Mexico Territory. They spent one night in the home of a friend, and the next day sold their horses and saddles before taking a stage to Deming. From there they took the train to Albuquerque, where they remained for two weeks. To avoid drawing undue attention from their enemies, the Earps visited the offices of the two newspapers and persuaded them to not write any stories about their presence.  Wyatt and Doc Holliday part ways  Wyatt and Holliday, who had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp's life in Dodge City during 1878, From Turner, Alford (Ed.), The O. K. Corral Inquest (1992) had a serious disagreement and parted ways in Albuquerque. According to a letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero, Wyatt and Holliday were eating at The Retreat Restaurant in Albuquerque owned by \\"Fat Charlie\\" \\"when Holliday said something about Earp becoming 'a damn Jew-boy.' Earp became angry and left‚Ä¶. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp‚Äôs woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house.\\" Wyatt was staying with a prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque‚Äôs Board of Trade. Jaffa was also Jewish, and based on the letter, Earp had while staying in Jaffa‚Äôs home honored Jewish tradition by performing the mezuzah upon entering his home. According to Otero's letter, Jaffa told him that \\"Earp‚Äôs woman was a Jewess.\\" Earp's anger at Holliday's religious slur may indicate that the relationship between Josephine Marcus and Wyatt Earp was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The group split up. They were leaving the uncertain justice of the American Frontier for the more defined justice of the federal and state court system. On about April 29, 1882, Wyatt Earp and his brother Warren, McMaster, Johnson, and Vermillion took the train to Trinidad and then Gunnison, Colorado, where they set up camp on the outskirts of town. They rarely went into town at first, except for supplies. Eventually, Wyatt took over a faro game at a local saloon. Holliday and Dan Tipton headed to Pueblo and then Denver. The split didn't last long. Less than two weeks later, Holliday was arrested on the Arizona warrant for killing Frank Stilwell. Wyatt intervened on Holliday's behalf and persuaded Bat Masterson to fabricate bunco charges against Holliday. Masterson then persuaded Colorado Governor Pitkin to refuse to honor Arizona's extradition request. Afterwards, Holliday and Wyatt met again in June 1882 in Gunnison; and then again lastly Holliday was able to see his old friend Wyatt in the late winter of 1886, where they met in the lobby of the Windsor Hotel. Sadie Marcus described the skeletal Holliday as having a continuous cough and standing on \\"unsteady legs.‚Äù = Premature rumors of Wyatt's death = In Tombstone, rumors flew about the activities of the Earp party. The Tombstone Nugget also printed a story on May 13, 1892, reporting that a rumor that Wyatt had been killed was probably true. They cited that a citizen had seen Wyatt at Henry Hooker's Sierra Bonita Ranch in Arizona during the previous week, and that Wyatt had been killed there \\"presumably by parties who have been following him since he left this place.\\" On the same day, the Los Angeles Herald and Albuquerque Evening Review ran the Tombstone Nuggetts story. = Story variations = Wyatt Earp first wrote down the story about the shootout at Iron Springs more than 11 years after the incident. Wyatt told varied accounts of the shootout at the springs a number of times during his life. Details varied between the different accounts, like getting his saddle pommel shot off, pulling up his loose cartridge belt, exactly when he helped \\"Texas Jack\\" Vermillion out from under his horse, the distance at which they initially encountered the Cowboys, and how far Earp dismounted from \\"Curly Bill\\". Before his death in 1887, Doc Holliday left his account of the gunfight in which he credited Wyatt as the individual responsible for shooting Curly Bill and another Cowboy.  Earp extradition sought  On May 16, 1882, the sheriff of Arapahoe County, Colorado notified Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan that he had Wyatt and Warren Earp in his custody, along with Doc Holliday. Behan applied to the governor for money to go to Colorado to bring the Earps back, but Governor Fremont instead gave the funds to Pima County Sheriff Bob Paul. Paul had received word on the same day from Denver that the sheriff there had five of the Earp party in custody. When Paul arrived in Denver, he served a warrant for Doc Holliday's arrest on charges that he killed Frank Stilwell in Tucson. Wyatt Earp, also in Denver, feared for Holliday's life if he was returned to Tombstone. He asked his friend and Trinidad, Colorado Sheriff Bat Masterson to help get Holliday released. Sheriff Masterson appealed to Governor Frederick W. Pitkin and succeeded in getting Holliday released from jail. Paul also knew of warrants for the Earps' arrest, but he was a friend of the men and never served the warrants. = Behan loses popularity = While Behan sought to arrest the Earps, his reputation among some citizens was very negative. On May 27, 1882, a \\"strong Democrat\\" was quoted in a letter in the Yuma, Arizona The Arizona Sentinel describing the events following the \\"murder of the noted desperado Frank Stilwell.\\" Readers may want to know \\"how these so-called Republican outlaws are regarded by decent, law-abiding people in Tombstone, regardless of politics.\\" The writer was of the opinion that Sheriff Behan wanted the requisition from Governor Fremont with the \\"object was to have them assassinated... Neither the Sheriff nor any of his deputies have ever turned a hand to find the murderers\\" of Morgan Earp. \\"There is no hope for any honest man to get justice here against these scoundrels as long as Behan is in office.\\" On May 29, 1882, Colorado Governor Pitkin finally refused to honor Arizona's extradition request, allowing Earp and the others to leave the state.  Other suspects  Wyatt and his posse were unable to apprehend or kill the remaining suspects. * Hank Swilling was last known when he was questioned in August 1878 about robbing the U.S. Mail. * Frederick Bode was last listed in the 1880 US Census in Charleston, Pima County.Fred Bode Arizona: Apache, Maricopa, Mohave, Pima, and Pinal (part: beginning-E.D. 11, sheet 7) Counties (NARA Series T9, Roll 36) * Johnny Ringo was found dead on July 14, 1882 in West Turkey Creek Valley, near Chiricahua Peak, with a bullet hole in his right temple.

It was in this location where Frank Stilwell, suspected in the murder of Morgan Earp on March 18, 1882, was killed by Wyatt Earp in the company of Doc Holliday. The location is now part of the Amtrak Station at 400 N. Toole Ave. in Tucson, Az. The 1967 film, Hour of the Gun, which stars James Garner as Wyatt Earp, is centered on the vendetta ride. On March 20, 2005, the 122nd anniversary of the killing of Frank Stilwell, a life-sized statue of Holliday and Earp by the sculptor Dan Bates was dedicated by the Southern Arizona Transportation Museum at the restored Historic Railroad Depot in Tucson, Arizona, at the approximate site of the shooting on the train platform. Wyatt Earp later claimed that \\"Doc and I were the only ones in Tucson at the time Frank Stilwell was killed\\".Roberts, 2011, p. 247 Long after the gunfight, Johnny Behan continued to spread rumors about the Earps. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in a story in the Washington Post, reprinted by the San Francisco Call, describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone. After referring to the highly controversial Fitzsimmons-Sharkey fight for which Wyatt Earp was referee, the article quoted Behan: Wyatt's action in taking justice into his own hands became one of the most well known examples of American frontier justice in American history. Wyatt Earp became the archetypal image of a real-life anti- hero. In 1927, Earp defended his decisions before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral and afterward to Stuart Lake, author of the 1931 largely fictionalized biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal:  See also  * List of feuds in the United States *Ten Percent Ring  References   Further reading  Category:Cochise County conflict Category:Conflicts in 1882 Category:Arizona Territory Category:American Old West gunfights Category:Arizona folklore Category:History of Cochise County, Arizona Category:Earp family Category:Crime in Arizona Territory Category:1882 in Arizona Territory Category:Vigilantism in the United States Category:March 1882 events Category:April 1882 events ","title":"Earp Vendetta Ride"},{"id":"3903575","text":"The Rebecca Shoal Light was located on a treacherous coral bank, Rebecca Shoal, west of the Marquesas Keys and east of the Dry Tortugas. The bank has at least a depth of and is subject to strong currents and rough seas. The first attempt to place a light on Rebecca Shoal was under the direction of Lt. George Meade starting in 1854. After structures were washed away twice in 1855 while still being erected, Meade wrote, \\"I believed then, and am satisfied now, that no light-house structure of any kind has been erected, either in this country or in Europe, at a position more exposed and offering greater obstacles than the Rebecca shoal.\\" A lighthouse was finally successfully erected on Rebecca Shoal in 1886. It was a -story square house set on high pilings. It was often impossible to land supplies or keepers at the lighthouse during bad weather. The lighthouse survived several hurricanes. The 1919 Florida Keys Hurricane broke the glass in the lighthouse's lantern and damaged the lens. The Spanish steamer Valbanera sank in that same hurricane five miles east of Rebecca Shoal, with the loss of all 488 people aboard. The lighthouse deteriorated after the light was automated in 1926, and was demolished in 1953. A skeletal tower was erected on the original pilings to hold the light. A new skeletal tower was built on new pilings in 1985, and the old tower and pilings removed. The lantern from the old lighthouse eventually ended up mounted on a private lighthouse in Key Largo.

The Fourteenth Amendment makes the right to confrontation applicable to the states and not just the federal government.Pointer v. Texas, https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=evidence&hl;=en&as;_sdt=2&as;_vis=1&oi;=scholarr The right only applies to criminal prosecutions, not civil cases or other proceedings. The Confrontation Clause has its roots in both English common law, protecting the right of cross-examination, and Roman law, which guaranteed persons accused of a crime the right to look their accusers in the eye. In noting the right's long history, the United States Supreme Court has cited Acts of the Apostles 25:16,Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012, 1015-16 (1988) which reports the Roman governor Porcius Festus, discussing the proper treatment of his prisoner Paul: \\"It is not the manner of the Romans to deliver any man up to die before the accused has met his accusers face-to-face, and has been given a chance to defend himself against the charges.\\" It is also cited in Shakespeare's Richard II, Blackstone's treatises, and statutes.See, e.g., Lilly v. Virginia, 527 U.S. 116 (1999) (Breyer, J. concurring)  Testimonial hearsay  In 2004, in Crawford v. Washington, the Supreme Court of the United States significantly redefined the application of the right to confrontation. In Crawford, the Supreme Court changed the inquiry from whether the evidence offered had an \\"indicia of reliability\\"Ohio v. Roberts to whether the evidence is testimonial hearsay. The shift was from a substantive and subjective inquiry into the reliability of the evidence, to a procedural question of whether the defendant had been afforded the right to confront her or his accuser. The Court implicitly noted the shift, \\"Dispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because the defendant is obviously guilty.\\" The Crawford Court decided the key was whether the evidence was testimonial because of the Sixth Amendment's use of the word \\"witness.\\" Quoting the dictionary, the Court explained that a witness is one who \\"bear[s] testimony\\" and that \\"testimony\\" refers to a \\"solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing some fact.\\" Nonetheless, in Crawford, the Supreme Court explicitly declined to provide a \\"comprehensive\\" definition of \\"testimonial\\" evidence (and, thus evidence subject to the requirements of the Confrontation Clause). In Davis v. Washington and its companion case, Hammon v. Indiana, the Court undertook exactly this task. The Court explained what constitutes testimonial hearsay: :Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances indicate that there is no ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution. The Davis Court noted several factors that, objectively considered, help determine whether a statement is testimonial: 1) whether the statement describes past events or events as they are happening, 2) whether the purpose of the statement is to assist in investigation of a crime or, on the other hand, provide information relevant to some other purpose, 3) the level of formality of the exchange in which the statement is made. The court noted that a single conversation with, for example, a 911 operator may contain both statements that are intended to address an ongoing emergency and statements that are for the purpose of assisting police investigation of a crime. The latter are testimonial statements because they are the sort of statements that an objectively reasonable person, listening to the statements, would expect to be used in an investigation or prosecution. The Crawford decision left the other basic components of the Confrontation Clause's applicability‚Äîthe witness's availability and the scope of the cross examination‚Äîunchanged.  Availability  If a statement is testimonial, the person making the statement must generally be available for cross examination. An exception to this rule is if the witness is unavailable. But even where the witness is unavailable, the defendant must have had a prior opportunity to confront the witness through cross examination. The latter requirement, cross examination, is discussed below. A witness may be unavailable for a variety of reasons. A common reason for a witness to be unavailable is that the witness is claiming a Fifth Amendment privilege against self incrimination. Other privileges are also a source of unavailability. Witnesses may also be unavailable because they have died, had memory loss, or simply decided not to cooperate as a witness against the defendant. The obvious may also occur, a witness may be intimidated, seriously injured, or murdered, and his prior statements then are usually not admissible even if it appears the defendant caused the nonappearance. The federal witness protection program was developed because of the difficulty of prosecuting cases where witnesses would disappear shortly before trial. U.S. Marshals Service, Witness Security Program California Witness Relocation and Protection Program These programs frequently require the witness to leave his residence or even family so that he can be protected before the trial occurs.  Cross-examination  Even where the witness is unavailable, the defendant usually has a right to cross-examine the witness. An exception to this rule, forfeiture by wrongdoing, is discussed below. The more obvious violations of the right to cross-examine witnesses are those where the defendant has never had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness at all, in any setting, or on any subject. The closer cases are those where some cross-examination has occurred, either at trial or prior to trial. Generally, having the opportunity to cross-examine a witness at trial will satisfy the Confrontation Clause's guarantee. And trial courts are given \\"broad discretion . . . to preclude repetitive and unduly harassing interrogation.\\"Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316 (1974) The Supreme Court has emphasized that the \\"Confrontation Clause guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defendant might wish.Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam) Nonetheless, a trial court cannot preclude cross-examination on some subjects. Besides the subject matter of the case, the crime for which a defendant is charged, a defendant has the right to attack the credibility or impeach the testimony of the witness. Despite trial courts' \\"broad discretion\\", it is an error to limit defendants from cross- examining witnesses on an area that would expose a \\"prototypical form of bias\\" that would be relevant to the jury's assessment of that witness's credibility.Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 680 (1986) Examples of such biases include being on probation as a juvenile delinquent, even where the state normally considers such a status to be protected confidential information; having charges dropped in exchange for testimony, despite a specific denial that dropping the charges had any effect on the testimony;Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 676-77 and shared allegiances of the victim and witness, including gang membership.Cousins v. Commonwealth, 693 S.E.2d 283 (Va. Ct. App. 2010)  Exceptions to the right of confrontation  In Crawford, the Supreme Court noted that two exceptions to the common law right of confrontation were acknowledged at the time the constitution was written: forfeiture by wrongdoing and dying declarations. Only the former has been explicitly adopted by the Court. = Forfeiture by wrongdoing = Where the defendant makes the witness unavailable for the purpose of preventing the witness from testifying, the defendant forfeits the right to confront the witness. This exception only applies to circumstances where the defendant acts with the purpose of preventing the testimony, but not to other circumstances where the defendant may nonetheless be blameworthy. For example, the testimonial statements of an uncross-examined murder victim are not admissible against the person who committed the murder unless the murder was committed for the purpose of preventing the victim from testifying.Zanders v. United States, 999 A.2d 149 (D.C. 2010) It is the prosecution's burden to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that the defendant secured the witness's unavailability for the purpose of preventing the witness to testify. = Dying declarations = Dying declarations, although noted by the Crawford Court as a historic exception to the common law right of confrontation, have not yet been explicitly acknowledged by the Court as an exception to the Confrontation Clause right. Lower courts have recognized the exception, but during oral argument in Michigan v. Bryant, the Court discussed the exception at length and frequently implied that the exception might apply, as it had done in Crawford and Giles.  Harmless error and standards of review  Confrontation Clause violations are usually subject to harmless error review . This means that even if evidence has been admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause, a defendant is not entitled to a new trial if the reviewing court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the inadmissible evidence did not contribute to the verdict. Harmless error is not a standard of review, and is an analysis for whether the error might have affected the jury's decision. Where a defendant fails to object to the inadmissible evidence at the time of trial or fails to specify that she or he is objecting on Confrontation Clause grounds, the reviewing court will sometimes only review for more substantial errors such as \\"plain error\\" or an error that results in a manifest injustice . Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal review unobjected to Confrontation Clause errors for plain error . State courts vary widely in their requirements for reviewing Confrontation Clause errors, but many review for either plain error, manifest injustice, or another similar standard. In many instances, courts reverse on Confrontation Clause grounds without analyzing whether an error is harmless. The most common reason for omitting such an analysis is the government's failure to raise harmlessness as an issue. Generally, defendants do not raise harmlessness unless the government does so.  Interaction with other laws  The states are free to interpret similar clauses in state constitutions more strictly than the Supreme Court's interpretation of the federal Confrontation Clause.The Decline of the Confrontation Clause in New York, 28 Touro L. Rev. 929 (2012), available at http://digitalcommons.tourolaw.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1164&context;=lawreview Because many jurisdictions, including the federal courts and a number of states, practice constitutional abstention many cases that include Confrontation Clause violations are decided on other grounds. Constitutional abstention is a judicial preference to resolve dispositive non-constitutional issues first, and only turning to constitutional issues if they are necessary to resolve the case. In Confrontation Clause cases, constitutional abstention most typically occurs where the court resolves a hearsay issue based on the relevant evidence code before turning to the Confrontation Clause analysis. Thus, a preference for interpreting other closely related laws first often leaves Confrontation Clause issues unaddressed.  Other sources of a right to confront witnesses  The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments also require confrontation as an element of due process. State statutes and constitutions are another source of the right to confront witnesses. See also * Cross-examination * Maryland v.

During a 50-year career he wrote prolifically and became renowned as one of the leading newspapermen of the first half of the 20th century. He is perhaps best known as co-author, with Lee Mortimer, of the controversial \\"Confidential\\" books, written in the late 1940s and early 1950s. Early years Jacquin Leonard Lait was born March 13, 1883 in New York City. His family then moved to Chicago, where Lait grew up. In 1901, Lait graduated from the Lewis Institute. Soon afterwards he began his journalistic career, working as a picture messenger for Chicago newspapers.\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) Journalistic career Lait readily adapted to the newspaper world of gangland-era Chicago, quickly learning the ins and outs of the police beat. Developing a knack for sensational reportage, he moved rapidly through the Hearst newspaper ranks from reporter to columnist and from editor to executive. In 1923, Lait became an editor of King Features Syndicate in New York. He wrote a syndicated column called All in the Family, which ran for two decades in Hearst papers. He also had a comic strip, Gus and Gussie, illustrated by Paul Fung, which ran from April 13, 1925 to February 24, 1930.Stripper's Guide In 1936, Lait was appointed editor of the New York Daily Mirror, succeeding Walter Howey. For 50 years, Lait was associated with the Hearst newspaper organization in one capacity or another.\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) During his tenure as editor of the New York Daily Mirror, the tabloid doubled its circulation and claimed the second highest circulation of any U.S. newspaper. In 1963, nine years after Lait's death, it ceased publication following a strike and was absorbed into the then top-selling paper the New York Daily News. Lait was known as a taciturn, tireless digger of news stories. In July of 1934, as the FBI was closing in on John Dillinger in Chicago, he was on the scene for an exclusive when Dillinger was killed. Lait's story, dispatched to the International News Service in New York, reached that city before even the Chicago papers were aware of what had happened.\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) The \\"Confidential\\" Books In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Lait, with co-author Lee Mortimer, wrote a series of four controversial books detailing the seamy underside of America and three of its main cities. Each of the four books had the word \\"confidential\\" in its title. Mortimer was a New York Daily Mirror newspaper columnist whom Lait had hired in the 1930s when he was editor.\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) The first book to appear was New York Confidential: The Lowdown on Its Bright Life, published in 1948. Chicago Confidential (1950) and Washington Confidential (1951) followed soon afterwards, with USA Confidential appearing in 1952. The books sold very well, and Washington Confidential became a bestseller in 1951. The books garnered much criticism in the press and elsewhere for their sensational, salacious tone and \\"nonfactual accounts of alleged crime-politics links, vice and scandal.\\"\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) In a New York Times review USA Confidential was labeled \\"a rather hard-breathing lecture on coast-to-coast depravity that represents about as discouraging a picture of America as you can find at the moment.\\"\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) Several lawsuits were filed against Lait and Mortimer due to the \\"Confidential\\" books. Perhaps the most prominent lawsuit was by the Neiman Marcus Co., which alleged that it and its employees had been libeled in U.S.A. Confidential. Neiman sought damages totaling $7,400,000. In August 1952, a federal judge dismissed the suits on the grounds that plaintiffs had not been sufficiently identified in the book to claim damages. In April 1953, Lait and Mortimer counter-sued seeking $1,500,000 for \\"conspiracy and agreement to restrain commerce, and suppress the printing, publication and distribution\\" of the book.\\"Jack Lait,71, Dies; Editor of Mirror\\" The New York Times (Friday, April 2, 1954, page 27) Sixty- three years after its publication Washington Confidential was described in an account as an \\"infamous guide to the D.C. demimonde\\" written by \\"a pair of right-wing hacks determined to peel back the city's white-frosted veneer to expose a fetid underbelly of Communist sympathizers, Chinese bookies, call girls, Mafiosi, and homosexuals.\\" It adds that while the book drips with disdain, it's \\"an underhanded ethnography rich in fascinating period detail.\\"\\"Washington Confidential: An Accidental Guide to the Gay D.C. of 1951\\" by Neda Ulaby CityPaper[Washington, D.C.] (June 6, 2014) Article Lait and Mortimer's books inspired the films New York Confidential (1955) and Chicago Confidential (1957) and the television series New York Confidential. Personal Lait married Laura Belle Leusch on March 6, 1906. Together they had a daughter, Lois, and two sons, Jack Lait, Jr., who became the radio and television editor at The Los Angeles Examiner, and George Lait, a director of publicity at Columbia Pictures. Jack Lait died April 1, 1954 of a circulatory ailment at his home in Beverly Hills, California at the age of 71.

Vancouver Sun, November 19, 2001. According to reports, the youths came across a nearly naked Webster and chased him to a parking area, where they beat him with baseball bats. After the beating, Webster was found beside a path in the park by his close friend Tim Chisholm, and died within minutes in Chisholm's arms.\\"Beating death shocks B.C.'s gay community\\", cbc.ca, November 18, 2001. Although some media called Webster's killing the first gay-related murder in Canadian history, much like the Matthew Shepard incident in the United States it merely attracted more widespread media attention than most earlier incidents. The coroner's report listed the cause of Webster's death as \\"a blow to the left side or back of the victim's neck. This blow caused a tear to the vertebral artery which resulted in a massive and rapidly fatal hemorrhage at the base of the brain.\\"Boei, William. \\"The idea was to get in a fight.\\" Vancouver Sun, December 20, 2003. A march and vigil was organized by Little Sisters Bookstore co-owner Jim Deva, and took place the day after the killing, with hundreds of people marching through the streets of downtown Vancouver toward the site of Webster's death. Another rally, including British Columbia Human Rights Commissioner Mary-Woo Sims, was held several weeks later. Vigils were also held in several other Canadian cities. The killing was widely covered in the national news in Canada, and led to significant controversy around whether the attack constituted a hate crime. The incident also received some coverage in the mainstream media in the United States, although gay media reported it far more prominently. Prosecution The crime went unsolved for over a year. On February 12, 2003, police arrested the first of four suspects, a 19-year-old from Burnaby. Under Canada's Youth Criminal Justice Act, his name could not be published as he was only 17 at the time of the incident. Although the police investigated the crime as a gay bashing, the prosecutor chose not to prosecute the case as an anti-gay hate crime, which under Canadian law would have permitted a stiffer sentence but may have been more difficult to prove ‚Äî instead, the case was treated as a simple manslaughter resulting from a robbery. The teenager pleaded guilty and told the police investigator that \\"the idea was to find, [and] get in a fight with someone.\\" Three more young men were subsequently arrested. One, a youth when the crime was committed, was charged under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and the other two, Ryan Cran and Danny Rao, were charged as adults. Judge Valmond Romilly rejected the prosecution's assertion that the incident was not a hate crime, finding the first teenager guilty and calling the incident \\"a thug brigade, stalking human prey for entertainment in a manner very reminiscent of Nazi youth in pre-war Germany\\".\\"Still in jail‚Äìfor now\\" , Xtra! West, February 3, 2005. Romilly handed down the maximum sentence permissible under the Act: two years in a youth detention centre and a third year under house arrest. The second young offender was also found guilty and sentenced to the same penalty, although the judge in that trial did not rule that the case constituted a hate crime. Justice Mary Humphries ruled Cran guilty of manslaughter and sentenced him to six years in prison, but acquitted Rao on the grounds that inconsistent and conflicting testimony made his role in the attack unclear.\\"B.C. man sentenced to six years for gay bashing\\", CTV News, February 9, 2005. Parole of Ryan Cran Cran, who was incarcerated at Matsqui Prison in British Columbia, applied for parole on April 3, 2007 after serving two years of his sentence.Denise Norman, \\"Parole is an easy way out of jail\\" , realjustice.ca. The Canadian parole board denied his parole, as he had been caught drinking vodka in a minimum security prison and was deemed to still be a risk to society. Cran was paroled on February 5, 2009.\\"Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death\\", cbc.ca, February 5, 2009. Spencer Herbert, the provincial MLA whose Vancouver-Burrard riding encompasses Stanley Park and Davie Village, subsequently called for the province to create a provincial telephone hotline for people to report gay bashing incidents and threats, as well as the appointment of a community victim services worker to investigate gay bashings. Legacy Webster had been president of Cityview, a housing cooperative in Vancouver. In 2005, Cityview officially changed its name to Aaron Webster Housing Cooperative. The Cooperative Housing Federation of B.C. also launched an Aaron Webster Memorial Fund to finance diversity projects in housing cooperatives. A memorial calendar was published in 2002 to raise funds by donation for a bench and shelter to be placed in Stanley Park in Webster's memory. Most of the images used were photos taken by Webster himself of Vancouver models. The calendar was sponsored by many Vancouver organizations. The calendar's reverse side featured a picture of Webster, as well as a poem by Deano Costa, \\"The Path\\".

History The village of Burtr√§sk (now part of the Skellefte√• municipality) claims V√§sterbotten cheese was invented there in the 1870s, supposedly by a dairy maid, Ulrika Eleonora Lindstr√∂m. According to legend, she was left alone to stir the curd of a traditional cheese but was interrupted, either by other chores or an assignation with her lover. This resulted in alternating periods of heating and stirring of the curdling milk. V√§sterbottencheese and v√§sterbottensost are registered trademarks owned by Norrmejerier,Svensk Varum√§rkesdatabas and the cheese is only produced at their dairy in Burtr√§sk. It is a hard cow's milk cheese with tiny eyes or holes and a firm and granular texture. As in Cheddar cheese, the curd is heated, cut, and stirred before the cheese is moulded and aged. Strong in flavour, its taste is described as somewhat like Parmesan cheese, salty, but with more bitter notes. It is light yellow in colour and has a fat content of 31%. Many Swedish people consider it the king of cheese and demand for it has often outstripped the limited supply. For this reason, it is roughly twice as expensive as other types of aged cheese. V√§sterbotten cheese must be aged for at least 12 months, but 14 months is more common. In Sweden, V√§sterbotten cheese is considered a must-have for the late summer crayfish party and is also eaten together with the traditional dish of pickled herring, year round. It adds a distinctive flavour to the highly popular V√§sterbotten cheese pie, or v√§sterbottensostpaj as it is known in Sweden. V√§sterbottensostpaj is the name given to the pie made using the cheese. Its main ingredients are V√§sterbotten cheese, cream and eggs. The pie is eaten widely in Sweden, especially during the celebrations of Christmas, Easter, Midsummer and during the crayfish season in August.

It received official party status in the province in April 2006. The party has not won any seats in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly. As of November 2015 it emphasized that \\"the Green Party embraces the Environmental Goals and Sustainable Prosperity Act (Nova Scotia) and the Nova Scotia Genuine Progress Index (GPI)...\\" \\\\- . The GPNS executive is organized regionally. Leadership Nick Wright of Halifax, Nova Scotia won its first contested leadership nomination race over Green Party of Canada candidate and organizer Sheila Richardson of Wolfville, Nova Scotia. In May 2007, Wright was replaced by Ken McGowan, but resigned in protest together with both his deputies in a constitutional struggle over unelected rival Ellen Durkee's presence on the executive ‚Äì to be replaced by Durkee as interim leader. Ryan Watson was elected Leader of the Green Party of Nova Scotia on June 29, 2008. Watson, from Halifax, was unopposed and contested the 2009 Nova Scotia general election. The party failed to file financial paperwork with Elections Nova Scotia by the April deadline, but when Watson resigned he denied this was the reason. On October 31, 2009, John Percy was announced as the new leader of the Green Party of Nova Scotia following a leadership contest against Sebastian Ronin. Dawna Toews was Percy's running mate and thus became Deputy Leader of the party. However, Toews moved to Ontario in early 2010 and thus resigned her position. Kris MacLellan was chosen as Deputy Leader by Executive Committee vote in October 2011, prior to the AGM. Percy made a point of emphasizing politicians of other political stripes he admired including Joe Clark, Ed Broadbent, Stephen Lewis and Peter Stoffer. After the 2013 Nova Scotia general election in which it fielded only 16 candidates in 51 districts, the party was largely dormant and invisible in NS politics. Leader John Percy was also Veterans Affairs Critic in the Green Party of Canada Shadow Cabinet, and this was an active file during the Stephen Harper administration until its demise in the 2015 Canadian federal election. Percy resigned in 2015 and was replaced by interim leader Brynn Nheiley. The party was to hold a leadership convention on February 6, 2016; however no one came forward to run for leader. After this experience of near-collapse, Thomas Trappenberg was elected leader in November 2016. He and Deputy Leader Jessica Alexander led the party in the 2017 election, when the party ran 32 candidates and received 2.78 percent of the vote. This was the highest total ever achieved by the party, both in terms of total votes and percentage, though the party did not win any seats. Conventions = Founding convention = The party's first convention was held on March 4‚Äì5, 2006. At the convention the party unanimously approved its constitution which divided powers in a way fairly conventional among Green parties: an executive controlled regional relations, regions retained control of their local policies and candidacies, and a policy committee took control of the overall platform and positions taken even during an election. The leader's role was to act as spokesperson and organize his or her most trusted critics as a Shadow Cabinet or (once elected) a Caucus. Leaders and deputies would run together on a \\"ticket\\" for continuity and to assess leader judgement of persons before they are elected to the critical role. Members also voted to support the six principles of the Global Green Charter, elected an executive and chose a party logo.

In April 2005, Cassino was birthed from the remnants of the two principal songwriters of the Alabama rock group Northstar ‚Äì an inevitably organic genesis that came to light through a creative bond that existed for numerous years between childhood friends Nick Torres and Tyler Odom. They began recording their first album in 2006 with Nashville-based producer‚Äìdrummer Craig Krampf, known for his work with artists including Dolly Parton, Alabama, Townes Van Zandt, Steve Perry and Melissa Etheridge. While the record doesn't have a specifically Nashville sound, the city did become prevalent in the making of their debut record Sounds of Salvation, both as a new environment to inspire songwriting, and in the cast of characters brought in by Krampf. ‚ÄúSalvation‚Äù was soon blessed by the contributions of E Street Band bassist Garry Tallent and saxophonist Jim Horn. Released independently on March 29, 2007, Sounds of Salvation is the fruit of this blending of various states and sounds. After touring the U.S. in support of the album, Cassino settled down and started working on another full-length record in the beginning of 2008. Odom exited the process (he now plays with the group Destry), and Torres teamed up to write primarily with Alabama native and long- time friend Edward Puckett. Puckett filled in on bass for the earlier Cassino tours, and through constant exposure, they found that their similar tastes and different styles complemented each other well. They set up shop in a small apartment, and wrote and recorded for most of 2008. The city of Nashville this time found its way into the recording process through the contributions of friends and session/touring musicians Kevin Arrowsmith (fiddle, banjo, mandolin), Tripper Ryder (bass) and Craig Krampf (drums, percussion). This newest endeavor became Kingprince. It was released digitally in December 2009, and was released physically in January 2010. Nick Torres and Ed Puckett have gone back into the studio to record a new album recorded and released in the form of two, six song EPs. The first half of the album was titled Bottlenecker and was scheduled to be released in the Spring of 2016. In early 2020 the band released two singles which would be included in their next EP. On February 28th the band released an eight song EP titled Yellowhammer. The album included a revised version of the previously released song, ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù, as well as a previously recorded song, ‚ÄúCorvette‚Äù.

This type of altimeter provides the distance between the antenna and the ground directly below it, in contrast to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a defined vertical datum, usually mean sea level. When used on aircraft, it may be known as low-range radio altimeter (LRRA). ITU definition ;See also: From the legal point of view, a radio altimeter is ‚Äì according to article 1.108 of the International Telecommunication Union's (ITU) ITU Radio Regulations (RR)ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems ‚Äì Article 1.108, definition: radio altimeter ‚Äì defined as ¬´Radionavigation equipment, on board an aircraft or spacecraft, used to determine the height of the aircraft or the spacecraft above the Earth's surface or another surface.¬ª Radionavigation equipment shall be classified by the radiocommunication service in which it operates permanently or temporarily. The use of radio altimeter equipment is categorised as so-called safety-of-life service, must be protected for Interferences, and is an essential part of Navigation. Principle As the name implies, radar (radio detection and ranging) is the underpinning principle of the system. The system transmits radio waves down to the ground and measures the time it takes them to be reflected back up to the aircraft. The altitude above the ground is calculated from the radio waves' travel time and the speed of light. Radar altimeters required a simple system for measuring the time-of-flight that could be displayed using conventional instruments, as opposed to a cathode ray tube normally used on early radar systems. To do this, the transmitter sends a frequency modulated signal that changes in frequency over time, ramping up and down between two frequency limits, Fmin and Fmax over a given time, T. In the first units, this was accomplished using an LC tank with a tuning capacitor driven by a small electric motor. The output is then mixed with the radio frequency carrier signal and sent out the transmission antenna. Since the signal takes some time to reach the ground and return, the frequency of the received signal is slightly delayed relative to the signal being sent out at that instant. The difference in these two frequencies can be extracted in a frequency mixer, and because the difference in the two signals is due to the delay reaching the ground and back, the resulting output frequency encodes the altitude. The output is typically on the order of hundreds of cycles per second, not megacycles, and can easily be displayed on analog instruments. This technique is known as Frequency Modulated Continuous-wave radar. Radar altimeters normally work in the E band, , or, for more advanced sea-level measurement, S band. Radar altimeters also provide a reliable and accurate method of measuring height above water, when flying long sea-tracks. These are critical for use when operating to and from oil rigs. The altitude specified by the device is not the indicated altitude of the standard barometric altimeter. A radar altimeter measures absolute altitude - the height Above Ground Level (AGL). Absolute altitude is sometimes referred to as height because it is the height above the underlying terrain. As of 2010, all commercial radar altimeters use linear frequency modulation - continuous wave (LFM-CW or FM- CW). As of 2010, about 25,000 aircraft in the US have at least one radio altimeter. \\"COMMENTS OF AVIATION SPECTRUM RESOURCES, INC.\\". p. 3, p. 8. Cody Miller. \\"A Radio Altimeter for Landing UAVs or Small Aircraft\\". 2010\\\\. History =Original concept= The underlying concept of the radar altimeter was developed independent of the wider radar field, and originates in a study of long-distance telephony at Bell Labs. During the 1910s, Bell Telephone was struggling with the reflection of signals caused by changes in impedance in telephone lines, typically where equipment connected to the wires. This was especially significant at repeater stations, where poorly matched impedances would reflect large amounts of the signal and made long- distance telephony difficult. Engineers noticed that the reflections appeared to have a \\"humpy\\" pattern to them; for any given signal frequency, the problem would only be significant if the devices were located at specific points in the line. This led to the idea of sending a test signal into the line and then changing its frequency until significant echos were seen, and then determining the distance to that device so it could be identified and fixed. Lloyd Espenschied was working at Bell Labs when he struck upon the idea of using this same phenomenon as a way to measure distances in wire in a more general fashion. One of his first developments in this field was a 1919 patent (granted 1924) on the idea of sending a signal into railway tracks and measuring the distance to discontinuities. These could be used to look for broken tracks, or if the distance was changing more rapidly than the speed of the train, other trains on the same line. =Appleton's ionosphere measurements= During this same period there was a great debate in physics over the nature of radio propagation. Guglielmo Marconi's successful trans- Atlantic transmissions appeared to be impossible; studies of radio signals demonstrated they travelled in straight lines, at least over long distances, so the broadcast from Cornwall should have disappeared into space instead of being received in Newfoundland. In 1902, Oliver Heaviside in the UK and Arthur Kennelly in the USA independently postulated the existence of an ionized layer in the upper atmosphere that was bouncing the signal back down to the ground so it could be received. This became known as the Heaviside layer. While an attractive idea, direct evidence was lacking. In 1924, Edward Appleton and Miles Barnett were able to demonstrate the existence of such a layer in a series of experiments carried out in partnership with the BBC. After scheduled transmissions had ended for the day, a BBC transmitter in Bournemouth sent out a signal that slowly increased in frequency. This was picked up by Appleton's receiver in Oxford, where two signals appeared. One was the direct signal from the station, the groundwave, while the other was received later in time after it travelled to the Heaviside layer and back again, the skywave. The trick was how to accurately measure the distance travelled by the skywave to demonstrate it was actually in the sky. This was the purpose of the changing frequency. Since the ground signal travelled a shorter distance, it was more recent and thus closer to the frequency being sent at that instant. The skywave, having to travel a longer distance, was delayed, and was thus the frequency as it was some time ago. By mixing the two in a frequency mixer, a third signal is produced that has its own unique frequency that encodes the difference in the two inputs. Since in this case the difference is due to the longer path, the resulting frequency directly reveals the path length. Although technically more challenging, this was ultimately the same basic technique being used by Bell to measure the distance to the reflectors in the wire. =Everitt and Newhouse= In 1929, William Littell Everitt, a professor at Ohio State University, began considering the use of Appleton's basic technique as the basis for an altimeter system. He assigned the work to two seniors, Russell Conwell Newhouse and M. W. Hively. Their experimental system was more in common with the earlier work at Bell, using changes in frequency to measure the distance to the end of wires. The two used it as the basis for a joint senior thesis in 1929. Everitt disclosed the concept to the US Patent Office, but did not file a patent at that time. He then approached the Guggenheim Foundation for development funding. James Doolittle, secretary of the Foundation, approached Vannevar Bush of Bell Labs to pass judgement. Bush was sceptical that the system could be developed at that time, but nevertheless suggested the Foundation fund development of a working model. This allowed Newhouse to build an experimental machine which formed the basis of his 1930 Master's thesis, in partnership with J. D. Corley. The device was taken to Wright Field where it was tested by Albert Francis Hegenberger, a noted expert in aircraft navigation. Hegenberger found that the system worked as advertised, but stated that it would have to work at higher frequencies in order to be practical. =Espenschied and Newhouse= Espenschied has also been considering the use of Appleton's idea for altitude measurement. In 1926 he suggested the idea both as a way to measure altitude as well as a forward- looking system for terrain avoidance and collision detection. However, at that time the frequency of available radio systems even in what was known as shortwave was calculated to be fifty times lower than what would be needed for a practical system. Espenschied eventually filed a patent on the idea in 1930. By this time, Newhouse had left Ohio State and taken a position at Bell Labs. Here he met Peter Sandretto, who was also interested in radio navigation topics. Sandretto left Bell in 1932 to become the Superintendent of Communications at United Air Lines (UAL), where he led the development of commercial radio systems. Espenschied's patent was not granted until 1936, and its publication generated intense interest. Around the same time, Bell Labs had been working on new tube designs that were capable of delivering between 5 and 10 Watts at up to 500 MHz, perfect for the role. This led Sandretto to contact Bell about the idea, and in 1937 a partnership between Bell Labs and UAL was formed to build a practical version. Led by Newhouse, a team had a working model in testing in early 1938, and Western Electric (Bell's manufacturing division) was already gearing up for a production model. Newhouse also filed several patents on improvements in technique based on this work. =Commercial introduction= The system was publicly announced on 8 and 9 October 1938. During World War II, mass production was taken up by RCA, who produced them under the names ABY-1 and RC-24. In the post-war era, many companies took up production and it became a standard instrument on many aircraft as blind landing became commonplace. A paper describing the system was published jointly by Espenschied and Newhouse the next year. The paper explores sources of error and concludes that the worst-case built-in scenario was on the order of 9%, but this might be as high as 10% when flying over rough terrain like the built-up areas of cities. During early flights of the system, it was noticed that the pattern of the returns as seen on an oscilloscope was distinct for different types of terrain below the aircraft. This opened the possibility of all sorts of other uses for the same technology, including ground-scanning and navigation. However, these concepts were not able to be explored by Bell at the time. =Use as general purpose radar= It had been known since the late 1800s that metal and water made excellent reflectors of radio signals, and there had been a number of attempts to build ship, train and iceberg detectors over the years since that time. Most of these had significant practical limitations, especially the use of low-frequency signals that demanded large antennas in order to provide reasonable performance. The Bell unit, operating at a base frequency of 450 MHz, was among the highest frequency systems of its era. In Canada, the National Research Council began working on an airborne radar system using the altimeter as its basis. This came as a great surprise to British researchers when they visited in October 1940 as part of the Tizard Mission, as the British believed at that time that they were the only ones working on the concept. However, the Canadian design was ultimately abandoned in favour of building the fully developed British ASV Mark II design, which operated at much higher power levels. In France, researchers at IT&T;'s French division were carrying out similar experiments when the German invasion approached the labs in Paris. The labs were deliberately destroyed to prevent the research falling into German hands, but German teams found the antennas in the rubble and demanded an explanation. The IT&T; director of research deflected suspicion by showing them the unit on the cover of a magazine and admonishing them for not being up-to-date on the latest navigation techniques. Civil aviation applications Radar altimeters are frequently used by commercial aircraft for approach and landing, especially in low-visibility conditions (see instrument flight rules) and automatic landings, allowing the autopilot to know when to begin the flare maneuver. Radar altimeters give data to the autothrottle which is a part of the Flight Computer. Radar altimeters generally only give readings up to above ground level (AGL). Frequently, the weather radar can be directed downwards to give a reading from a longer range, up to above ground level (AGL). , all airliners are equipped with at least two and possibly more radar altimeters, as they are essential to autoland capabilities. (, determining height through other methods such as GPS is not permitted by regulations.) Older airliners from the 1960s (such as the British Aircraft Corporation BAC 1-11) and smaller airliners in the sub-50 seat class (such as the ATR 42 and BAe Jetstream series) are equipped with them. Radar altimeters are an essential part in ground proximity warning systems (GPWS), warning the pilot if the aircraft is flying too low or descending too quickly. However, radar altimeters cannot see terrain directly ahead of the aircraft, only that below it; such functionality requires either knowledge of position and the terrain at that position or a forward looking terrain radar. Radar altimeter antennas have a fairly large main lobe of about 80¬∞ so that at bank angles up to about 40¬∞, the radar detects the range from the aircraft to the ground (specifically to the nearest large reflecting object). This is because range is calculated based on the first signal return from each sampling period. It does not detect slant range until beyond about 40¬∞ of bank or pitch. This is not an issue for landing as pitch and roll do not normally exceed 20¬∞. Military aviation applications Radar altimeters are also used in military aircraft to fly quite low over the land and the sea to avoid radar detection and targeting by anti-aircraft guns or surface-to-air missiles. A related use of radar altimeter technology is terrain-following radar, which allows fighter bombers to fly at very low altitudes. The F-111s of the Royal Australian Air Force and the U.S. Air Force have a forward-looking, terrain- following radar (TFR) system connected via digital computer to their automatic pilots. Beneath the nose radome are two separate TFR antennae, each providing individual information to the dual-channel TFR system. In case of a failure in that system, the F-111 has a back-up radar altimeter system, also connected to the automatic pilot. Then, if the F-111 ever dips below the preset minimum altitude (for example, 15 meters) for any reason, its automatic pilot is commanded to put the F-111 into a 2G fly-up (a steep nose-up climb) to avoid crashing into terrain or water. Even in combat, the hazard of a collision is far greater than the danger of being detected by an enemy. Similar systems are used by F/A-18 Super Hornet aircraft operated by Australia and the United States.

Royal and Cameron Streets in Old Town Alexandria, Virginia. The complex includes a c. 1785 tavern, the 1792 City Tavern and Hotel, and 1878 hotel addition. The taverns were a central part of the social, economic, political, and educational life of the city of Alexandria, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963. Currently, the complex is home to Gadsby's Tavern Restaurant, American Legion Post 24, and Gadsby's Tavern Museum, a cultural history museum. The museum houses exhibits of early American life in Virginia, and the restaurant operates in the original 1792 City Tavern dining room, serving a mixture of period and modern foods. Tavern history Gadsby's Tavern consists of two buildings: one is the tavern built around 1785, and the other is the 1792 City Hotel. John Gadsby leased and operated them from 1796 to 1808, and it is his name attached to the location. =Early history= Gadsby's Tavern was not the first tavern on its lot. Between 1749 and 1752, Charles and Anne Mason had begun a tavern business they called Mason's Ordinary. In the 1770s, Mary Hawkins opened a tavern on the lot around the corner from what is now the Gadsby's Tavern Museum. The original lot where Hawkin's tavern sat extended from the southwest corner of Royal and Cameron streets to about mid-block on both streets.New Date for Tavern Building Construction In 1778, the plot was subdivided, and Edward Owens purchased the lot on the corner of the two streets. With the end of the Revolutionary War, and the booming economy that followed, Marylander John Wise purchased the plot in 1782 from Owens, and built the existing Georgian-style tavern ca. 1785, and the Federal City Tavern in 1792. Englishman Gadsby leased the City Tavern, the most prominent tavern in Alexandria in 1796. He renewed the lease in 1802 to include the smaller 1785 tavern from Wise, and operated both until 1808 when he moved to Baltimore, Maryland. John Wise died in 1815, and with his death the buildings went through different hands, being run as a hotel, lawyers' offices, and auction houses. It remained a hotel during the American Civil War. In 1816, a 23-year-old woman succumbed to a disease at the city tavern after she travelled to Alexandria with her husband. On her deathbed, she made the people surrounding her swear an oath that they would never reveal her identity. The promise was kept; her grave, a table-like structure in St. Paul's Cemetery is marked \\"Female Stranger\\". Her ghost is said to haunt the cemetery and Room 8 of Gadsby's Tavern, the room in which she died.Haunted History:Washington, D.C. documentary The unusual monument and story surrounding it have long been noted as a peculiar oddity of the town. =19th and 20th century= By the turn of the 20th century, the building no longer operated as a hotel. Once considered one of the finest establishments of its kind in the country, the building had fallen into complete disrepair. The rooms that had been the setting for political dinners, grand balls, and elaborate public affairs were relegated to housing odd shops and rental apartments. On May 21, 1917, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City purchased some of Alexandria's most important pieces of history, the ballroom woodwork. In doing so, they inadvertently preserved the original historic ballroom when it was moved to New York. The Met negotiated with the owners of the 1792 City Tavern & Hotel to purchase architectural elements from the hotel. The Met purchased the unique musicians gallery, cornice, door frames, and mantelpieces from the ballroom. Two mantelpieces from the City Hotel dining rooms and the exterior doorway were also sold.

The Marquis de Lafayette was also guest to festivities at the City Tavern during his tour of the United States in 1824.

History The Institute of Legal Executives as it stands was established in 1963 with the help of the Law Society of England and Wales to provide a more formal process for training so-called \\"solicitors' clerks\\". Prior to that the Institute had various incarnations dating back to 1892. Charles Dickens was a solicitor's clerk (he drew on his experience for characters in his novels, and a solicitor's managing clerk is featured in Galsworthy's Justice). Traditionally, solicitors' clerks were not formally trained in law, but through experience had built up a working knowledge of specific aspects and could carry out legal paperwork as a fee earner. The creation of the Institute of Legal Executives meant that solicitors' clerks became qualified \\"legal executives\\" (holding a practising certificate and having a similar role to solicitors in practicing law). Legal Executive Lawyers gained rights that allow them to become partners in law firms, advocates with rights of audience in Court and also judges. On 13 October 2011 the Institute of Legal Executives (as a company limited by guarantee) sought Royal Charter status from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II via the Privy Council. A Royal Charter was granted in 2012 and the Institute of Legal Executives became the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives \\"CILEx\\". Purpose CILEx set out to create a formal process for training legal support staff that would be recognised and respected in the legal community. With growing recognition The institute's purpose has evolved: it now has its own front line regulator, CILEx Regulation (formerly ILEX Professional Standards or IPS) and provides a vocational career route from trainee to professional lawyer. Law graduates may also take an alternative route to becoming a solicitor by taking CILEx's Graduate Fast-track Diploma. The profile of the institute's membership is also changing. Some of the most able Chartered Legal Executives are now law firm partners and Chartered Legal Executives can also become coroners and Judges in England and Wales.Judicial Appointments Commission - Retrieved February 2011 In late 2014 CILEx lawyer members were granted independent practice rights, which means that they do not have to have their work signed off by solicitors and can run their own firms as sole practitioners.

Cuisine Chiltepe, a common pepper used on some Guatemalan dishes. Chipil√≠n Tamal, a common dish usually eaten at dinner. Guatemalan cuisine reflects the multicultural nature of Guatemala, in that it involves food that differs in taste depending on the region. Guatemala has 22 departments (or divisions), each of which has very different food varieties. For example, Antigua Guatemala is well known for its candy which makes use of many local ingredients fruits, seeds and nuts along with honey, condensed milk and other traditional sweeteners. Antigua's candy is very popular with tourists. Many traditional foods are based on Maya cuisine and prominently feature corn, chilis and beans as key ingredients. Various dishes may have the same name as dishes from a neighboring country, but may in fact be quite different for example the enchilada or quesadilla, which are nothing like their Mexican counterparts. There are also foods that it is traditional to eat on certain days of the week - for example, by tradition it is known that on Thursday, the typical food is \\"paches\\", which is like a tamale made with a base of potato, and on Sundays it is traditional to eat tamales, because Sundays are considered holidays. Certain dishes are also associated with special occasions, such as fiambre for All Saints Day on November 1 and tamales, which are common for Christmas. There are reportedly hundreds of varieties of tamales throughout Guatemala. The key variations are what is in the masa or dough (corn, potatoes, rice), what's in the filling (meat, fruits, nuts), and what it is wrapped with (leaves, husks). The masa is made out of corn that is not sweet, such as what is known as feed corn in the U.S.A. In Guatemala, this non-sweet corn is called maize and the corn that Americans from the USA are used to eating on the cob, sweet corn, they call elote. Tamales in Guatemala are more typically wrapped in plantain or banana leaves and mashan leaves than corn husks. The ancient Mayan civilization lasted for about six hundred years before collapsing around 900 A.D. Today, almost half of the Guatemalan population is still Mayan. These natives live throughout the country and grow maize as their staple crop. In addition, the ancient Maya ate amaranth, a breakfast cereal similar to modern day cereals. Music Guatemala's national instrument is the marimba, an idiophone from the family of the xylophones, which is played all over the country, even in the remotest corners. Towns also have wind and percussion bands that play during the Lent and Easter-week processions, as well as on other occasions. The Garifuna people of Afro-Caribbean descent, who are spread thinly on the northeastern Caribbean coast, have their own distinct varieties of popular and folk music. Cumbia, from the Colombian variety, is also very popular, especially among the lower classes. Guatemala also has an almost five-century-old tradition of art music, spanning from the first liturgical chant and polyphony, introduced in 1524 to contemporary art music. Much of the music composed in Guatemala from the 16th century to the 19th century has only recently been unearthed by scholars and is being revived by performers. Textiles The Mayan people are known for their brightly colored yarn-based textiles, which are woven into capes, shirts, blouses, and dresses. Each village has its own distinctive pattern, making it possible to distinguish a person's home town on sight. Women's clothing consists of a shirt and a long skirt. Religion Roman Catholicism combined with the indigenous Maya religion to form the unique syncretic religion which prevailed throughout Guatemala and still does in the rural regions. Beginning from negligible roots prior to the 1960s, Protestant Pentecostalism has grown to become the predominant religion of Guatemala City and other urban centers and down to mid-sized towns. The unique religion is reflected in the local saint, Maxim√≥n, who is associated with the subterranean force of masculine fertility and prostitution. Always depicted in black, he wears a black hat and sits on a chair, often with a bible in one hand, rosary in another, and religious food in his mouth at his feet. The locals know him as San Simon of Guatemala.

Founded in 1926 by the English Benedictine community, the School is located on a 525-acre campus along Rhode Island's Narragansett Bay.  History  The school and monastery are located on land originally owned by the Freeborn family beginning in the 1650s. The land was later owned by the Anthony family, and in 1778 it was the site of the Battle of Rhode Island during the American Revolution. In 1864 Amos Smith, a Providence financier, built what is now known as the Manor House and created a gentleman's farm on the site with the help of architect Richard Upjohn. After buying the Manor House and surrounding land in 1918, Dom Leonard Sargent of Boston, a convert from the Episcopal Church, founded Portsmouth Priory on October 18, 1918. The priory was founded as, and remains, a house of the English Benedictine Congregation. It is one of only three American houses in the congregation, and maintains a unique connection with sister schools in England, including Ampleforth College and Downside School. The school was founded as Portsmouth Priory by John Hugh Diman, a Benedictine monk, and a former Episcopalian. Portsmouth was not Diman's first school. In 1896, Diman founded Diman's School for Small Boys - later, St. George's School - in Middletown, Rhode Island. In 1912, aware that St. George's School catered to the sons of more affluent families and eager to provide educational opportunities to working-class students, Diman founded the Diman Vocational School in Fall River, MA. A conversion experience brought Diman to Catholicism and ultimately to the Benedictines who were just beginning a priory in Portsmouth. After joining the Order of Saint Benedict, Diman was again moved to found a school. In 1926, Diman founded the Portsmouth Priory School, which would be redesignated as Portsmouth Abbey School - indicating the increased size of its monastic community - in 1969. Originally, Portsmouth Priory offered a classical education to boys. Using the British \\"public\\" school model, the Priory School employed a form system, and supplemented a student's education with co-curricular activities, such as athletics and the arts. The same British system along with an updated and much expanded selection of co- curricular offerings are still at the core of a Portsmouth Abbey School education today. The school's campus is located on more than on the shores of Narragansett Bay. Many of the buildings were designed by post-modern architect Pietro Belluschi, dean of the architecture and planning school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A parcel of the school's land is leased to The Aquidneck Club (formerly the Carnegie Abbey Club) where the student golf team practices and holds its interscholastic golf matches.  Portsmouth Abbey School today  Today the school, often referred to as \\"the Abbey,\\" has students from 17 nations and 26 states. Its enrollment totals over 350 students, living in the school's eight residential Houses or commuting from nearby towns. Internet access is available in computer labs and all House libraries. The average size for a class is 12 to 14 students, with a student- teacher ratio of 7 to 1. Activities and clubs include the Appalachia Service Project, The Beacon (the student newspaper), The Raven (the art and literary magazine), Scriptorium (scholarly journal), The Gregorian (yearbook), Model United Nations, New England Math League, Future Problem Solvers, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, Community Service Projects, Debate Club, Red Key (campus tour guides), Social Committee, Astronomy Club, Peer Tutors, Pro Deo Orchestra, Student Athletic Advisory Board, Teens Leading Children (TLC), and Student Council. The school also has a fine arts center, a photography lab and darkroom, a digital art studio, an art gallery (which alternatively displays traveling exhibits and selected student work), a drama program (which produces three plays per year, including the annual musical), a music tech lab, voice and instrumental offerings, and private music lessons. The school has a radio station, WJHD 90.7 FM. In 2006, the school installed a Vestas V47-660 kW wind turbine, the first such project in Rhode Island, to provide forty percent of the school's electricity. Other green initiatives at Portsmouth Abbey School include the construction of two energy efficient faculty residences in September 2011, \\"unfolded\\" on campus by Blu Homes, a company building eco- friendly, prefabricated homes. In addition, one of Portsmouth Abbey School's girls' residential houses, St. Brigid's, and the newest boys' residential house, St. Martin's, employ a number of conservation features, including recycled wood and low-VOC construction materials; hot-water solar panels; flooring materials from renewable and recycled sources; energy-recovery ventilators; low-flow shower heads and toilets; and high-efficiency/low- emission Viessmann boilers. In 2019, the School completed construction of a 34,123 square-foot LEED Gold certified science building. Portsmouth Abbey School's security and maintenance departments operate two electric vehicles on campus, and the School's dining services department has implemented a \\"tray- less\\" dining program, a composting program, and a partnership with Newport Biodiesel (the School provides the waste cooking oil used by its dining services to Newport Biodiesel for clean-burning alternative fuel). Each office on campus maintains paper and plastic recycling bins, and the Portsmouth Abbey School Alumni Bulletin, the School's bi-annual magazine, is printed on FSC- certified paper, a product group from well-managed forests and other controlled sources.  Athletics  In addition to The Aquidneck Club golf course next door available for use by the faculty and by the golf team, the school's athletic facilities include eight squash courts and a fitness center, a six-lane, all-weather track, a multi-sport synthetic turf field, six tennis courts, an indoor ice hockey rink, two gymnasiums, and multiple outdoor playing fields. Portsmouth Abbey is a member of the Eastern Independent League and has occasional contests against ISL (Independent School League) schools and other non-league boarding and day schools in New England. The Abbey's rivals include St. George's School and Pomfret School. Teams include a sailing team, golf team, wrestling team, squash team, tennis team, lacrosse team, softball team, field hockey team, baseball team, cross country team, basketball team, track & field teams, and a football team. Equestrian activities are offered at Abbey Club's Equestrian Center adjacent to the School. Portsmouth Abbey School's co-ed varsity sailors were New England champions in 2009, 2010 and 2013; they competed in Nationals in four of the past five years, earning 4th Place nationally in 2013.  Traditions  The school has a number of traditions such as the Raven Cup, a year-long school- spirit competition among the student residential houses; a six-day week with classes on Saturday mornings followed by athletics games; the Headmaster's Run, an annual all-School run through the fall campus; and a required year of Latin language study. In the center of the School campus is a large quadrangle called the Holy Lawn that is used exclusively for commencement exercises.

In other parts of the world the song is better known by recordings of other artists. In 1964, a band from Plattsburgh, New York called the Twiliters recorded a live version but it did not chart. A version by Chad Allan and the Expressions, later known as The Guess Who, was recorded in December 1964. It reached #1 in Canada in the spring of 1965,The Guess Who, \\"Shakin' All Over\\" Canadian Chart Position, Retrieved March 5, 2015 #22 in the US and #27 in Australia. Normie Rowe's 1965 version reached No. 1 in Australia as a double A-side with \\"Que Sera Sera\\". History =Johnny Kidd version= The musicians who performed on the recording were Johnny Kidd (vocals), Alan Caddy (guitar), Brian Gregg (bass), Clem Cattini (drums) and Joe Moretti (lead guitar). Kidd was quoted as saying: > When I was going round with a bunch of lads and we happened to see a girl > who was a real sizzler, we used to say that she gave us 'quivers down the > membranes'. It was a standard saying with us referring to any attractive > girl. I can honestly say that it was this more than anything that inspired > me to write \\"Shakin' All Over\\". =The Twiliters version= The Twiliters, a band from Plattsburgh, New York, recorded \\"Shakin' All Over\\" live, in early 1964, before a crowd at a local skating rink called \\"Rollerland\\". Bill Kennedy, the leader of the group, had been stationed in Germany in the Air Force and had heard several songs from the UK that he wanted to record. It was released on Empire Records E-4 and gained some regional success. On the flip side was a song called \\"Rollerland\\" that was recorded by at least two other acts. =The Guess Who version= The song gained more fame after it was recorded in Winnipeg, Canada in December 1964 by a group called Chad Allan and the Expressions. The group's record label Quality Records credited the artist on the label as \\"Guess Who?\\" in an attempt to disguise the group's origin. The label thought the record would be better received if the group were thought to be a British Invasion act. The actual name of the group was revealed a few months later, but radio DJs continued to announce the artists as \\"Guess Who?\\". This prompted the group to change their name to The Guess Who. In the spring of 1965 the record became a #1 hit in Canada. This version was also a #22 hit in the United States.The Guess Who, \\"Shakin' All Over\\", U.S. Chart Position, Retrieved March 5, 2015 The song would later rechart in the U.S., reaching #102 in 1975.Joel Whitburn's Bubbling Under the Billboard Hot 100 1959-2004 =Normie Rowe version= The Guess Who's version also became a #27 hit in Australia, but another version became a national #1 hit in late 1965 for Normie Rowe. Rowe's version (backed by \\"Que Sera Sera\\") was one of the biggest-selling singles of the decade in that country. Rowe had recorded his take on the song before The Guess Who, and based his release on a 1962 version by Johnny Chester. =The Who version= The song has been performed many times by The Who, starting in the 1960s, (sometimes in a medley with \\"Spoonful\\"). The best known performances were at Woodstock in 1969 and on Live at Leeds in 1970. In Randy Bachman's autobiography, he says that when he met Who bass player John Entwistle, he was told that people constantly got The Who and The Guess Who mixed up. Tired of being yelled at for not playing the song, the Who started playing it just to keep the crowd happy. Bachman responded that the Guess Who had the same reasons for playing \\"My Generation\\". Entwistle, a fan of 1950s and 1960s rock and roll and rockabilly music, also performed the song with his solo band and incorporated a bass solo into the middle of the song, accompanied only by his drummer Steve Luongo. =The Head Cat version= The Head Cat also recorded this song in their second studio album, Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk (2001).

It was officially opened on 9 March 1984 by Urban Councillor Elsie Elliott. The Sham Shui Po Park Swimming Pool opened in 1985. Sham Shui Po Park (Stage II) was an extension of the park on two physically separate sites ‚Äì one contiguous with the original park. The contiguous site was once occupied by a temporary housing area and the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Fresh Water Fish Market. Part of the fish market site was eventually used for the construction of the Ka Ling School of The Precious Blood, which was originally slated to be built within the boundary of Lai Kok Estate. The Urban Council gave up the land for this school in exchange for land within Lai Kok Estate (see below). Stage II was completed in 2008. The Yen Chow Street Temporary Housing Area site was once occupied by the Jubilee Buildings, apartments for British Army families completed in 1935. These were used (as was the whole site) as a prisoner-of-war camp during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945. Following the Vietnam War and the influx of Vietnamese refugees to Hong Kong it became the Jubilee Transit Centre. Originally designed to house 500 members of army families, the population of Vietnamese refugees swelled to more than 3,000 by 1983. Caritas Hong Kong took over the camp and managed it, running within its confines a nursery, a recreation centre, a clinic, minors quarters, and a school. The refugee camp site was then occupied by the temporary housing area, with a capacity of 278 housing units. It was cleared in the late 1990s for the park extension and most of the families were resettled in public housing. The smaller site also used for the Stage II expansion, discontiguous with the first phase of the park, is located within Lai Kok Estate, on the opposite side of Lai Chi Kok Road, and formerly came under the management of the Housing Department. It was opened as a park in 1984 and redeveloped in the 2000s (as part of the Stage II expansion project). During the redevelopment the bicycle field and the volleyball courts were removed and replaced with a landscaped garden. Memorial The park was once occupied by the Sham Shui Po Camp. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong between 1941 and 1945, the camp was used for prisoners of war. Many of them died in the camp. Inside the park, several trees were planted 26 August 1989 by Hong Kong Prisoners of War Association in memory of the soldiers who died during the Battle of Hong Kong and in the prison during that period. Furthermore, two maple trees were planted by Hong Kong Veterans Association of Canada on 5 December 1991 in memory of Canadian soldiers who died in the detention camp. Crows In the early 2000s, the park and surrounding areas attracted many crows to resite to cause much nuisance to residences nearby. The first wave of bird flu outbreak of type H5N1 at the time aroused much concern to the community.

It is home to the Chariho school district's main campus and is otherwise largely turf farms. Geography Wood River Junction is commonly considered by locals to be one of the coldest locations in the state of Rhode Island, due to its low-lying and flat geography. It is the home of Meadowbrook Pond, also known as Wood River Pond, a popular fishing and swimming area. It is surrounded by two rivers: the Wood River and Pawcatuck River. History =Overview= The village is the site of the former Wood River Branch Railroad Station. The Wood River Branch of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad was chartered in 1872 and completed in 1874. On April 19, 1873 a train disaster was caused by a bridge washout and burning of passenger cars.Infos on GenDisasters The Branch was built to provide service from the Hope Valley to the main line of the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad and was only six miles long. The New Haven Railroad took over operation of the Branch in 1892 and eventually abandoned it on August 8, 1947. The main line continues in operation today as Amtrak's Northeast Corridor. =Criticality accident= On 24 July 1964, a fatal criticality accident occurredArticle on Yankee at the United Nuclear Corporation Wood River Junction nuclear facility. This facility was designed to recover highly enriched uranium in scrap material from fuel element production. Technician Robert Peabody was working with a tank containing radioactive uranium-235 in a sodium carbonate solution, which was being agitated by a stirrer. Intending to add a bottle of trichloroethane to remove organics, he mistakenly added a bottle of uranium solution to the tank, producing a criticality excursion (uncontrolled chain reaction) accompanied by a flash of light and the splashing of about 20% of the tank's contents (about out of , including the bottle contents) out of the tank. This criticality exposed the 37-year-old Peabody to a fatal radiation dose of \\"more than 700 rem\\", which is 7 Sv. He died 49 hours after the incident. Ninety minutes later a second excursion happened when a plant manager returned to the building and turned off the agitator, exposing himself and another administrator to doses of up to 100 rad (1 Gy) without apparent ill effect. Members of the local Hope Valley Ambulance Squad (HVAS) responded to render aid, initially transporting the patient to Westerly Hospital; the hospital was not equipped for such a patient, the ambulance was turned away and the ambulance transported the patient to Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Although commonly referred to as taking place in Wood River Junction, the incident actually occurred just across the river in Charlestown.

It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo. History The groundbreaking for the school was performed on September 21, 1960 by then-bishop of Toledo, Bishop George J. Rehring. The first class entered the following fall. The school is named for Samuel Cardinal Stritch, the second bishop of Toledo during the years of 1921 through 1930, and eventually cardinal archbishop of Chicago. On the school's website it states, \\"A twenty-acre site was chosen for the East Side area's first co-institutional high school.\\" One side of the school was originally reserved for boys' classes, while the other was for girls', with co-educational classes being held in the center sections. (The separate wings were integrated in 1971 when all classes became co- educational.) The first principal was Monsignor Michael Walz, who initiated the \\"Stritch Family\\" concept. Succeeding principals include: Rev. John A. Thomas, Rev. Frank Nieset, Sister Louis de Montfort, Rev. Frank Murd, and Rev. Robert J. Yeager, EdD. In 1997, the bishop appointed Rev. John Stites as the first president of the school, and Timothy Mahoney was assigned the next principal. Mahoney became the first lay person to be assigned principal of the school. In 2004, Father David Reinhart was appointed president of Cardinal Stritch High School. During his time at Cardinal Stritch High School, Father Reinhart has led an unprecedented upgrade to campus facilities and has given vision to a new way of thinking about Catholic education in light of a theology of stewardship. Under Father Reinhart's leadership, Cardinal Stritch High School has been recognized as one of the top 50 Catholic high schools by the National Catholic High School Honor Roll. The high school has also taken on leadership roles in the creation of the \\"Live It\\" initiative and the Kateri Education Project, a regional study of Catholic education. They have adopted a service learning program, \\"Stewards of Stritch\\", moved from monthly to weekly Mass for all of its students, and helped the entire high school community focus toward the Eucharist as the source and summit of the faith and therefore, at the center of the school. Kelli Malinowski was appointed principal for the 2010‚Äì2011 school year and stepped down on August 26, 2011. Tim Malone was appointed the next principal, and was the third lay person to be principal of Cardinal Stritch Catholic High School.

The mission of the community is to seek God guided by the Gospel, the Rule of St. Benedict, and most importantly, prayer and work to sanctify themselves and their community. your bitcoinHistory and description The monastery was founded in 1918 as Portsmouth Priory by Dom Leonard Sargent, an American monk of Downside Abbey in England. In keeping with the congregation‚Äôs early history, the monks run a college preparatory boarding school for boys and girls. The monks also focused on scholarly and artistic work, and hospitality, as well as helping local parishes. The English Benedictine Congregation (EBC), of which Portsmouth Abbey is a member, is the oldest of the Benedictine congregations. It has canonical continuity with the first congregation established in the 13th century by the Holy See. The monks of the EBC run schools attached to their monasteries and look after 27 small parishes and mass centers near them. In addition, 30 parishes and 14 mass centers in England and Wales are served by EBC monks. A tradition revived by Fr Augustine Baker in the early 1600s laid great emphasis on contemplative and mystical prayer. This tradition continues in the EBC and at Portsmouth Abbey today.Portsmouth Abbey website Saint Benedict did not specify how monks should earn their living: he stipulated only that work be done in the spirit of corporate prayer and Christ-like love. With that guidance in mind, the Portsmouth Abbey monks maintain a school to generate income. Portsmouth Abbey School has been operated continuously since it was founded in 1926. Its mission statement is based on reverence for God and the human person, respect for learning and order; and responsibility for the shared experience of community life. The community and liturgical life of the monastery overflow into the school as a valuable contribution to society. For the monks themselves, the school provides work in a task that is fully human and that is not escapist from social obligations or fostering \\"a fugitive and cloistered virtue\\". From teaching and being responsible for the young, the monk can learn a unique form of selflessness which can be realized in the exercise of spiritual fatherhood. Recruiting Monks at Portsmouth Abbey have used the internet to drive recruitment. The monastery maintains a Facebook page, and features Frequently Asked Questions for would-be monks on their site.

In 2015 it had 11,237 inhabitants.  History  The town was founded in the 11th century by the Dregovichs, who erected a large fort and a tribal centre there. In the 14th century the town became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and then part of the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth in the wake of the Polish-Lithuanian Unions. In the 1506 Battle of Kleck, the Polish-Lithuanian forces under Micha≈Ç Gli≈Ñski defeated the Tartar armies and saved the town from being pillaged. Soon afterwards, the town became a property of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç magnate family, who started to attract Jewish settlers to the area. The earliest known mention of the local Jewish community is a document dated September 5, 1522, issued by King Sigismund I the Old of Poland. In it, the monarch awarded for three years to Isaac Jesofovitch, a Jew of Brest, for the sum of 300 times sixty grosz a lease of the inns and other sources of revenue in Kletsk. The next mention of the Kletzk community, as it was known in Yiddish, is found in a document dated January 21, 1529, which imposes military duties on its inhabitants, as well as on those of other towns. On June 15, 1542, the boyar Grishko Kochevich brought suit against Zachariah Markovich, a Jew of Kletzk, the latter's oxen having broken into Grishko's field and injured the growing grain; the court awarded to Grishko twelve \\"ruble groschen\\" damages. A census taken in 1552-55 shows that the Jewish householders lived chiefly on Wilna street, on the Sloboda, and owned gardens in the suburbs. Kletzk is mentioned in the assessment on the Lithuanian communities in 1566, and from its small proportionate assessment it appears that the community was not important at that time. In 1586 the town became the capital of Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's ordynacja, which sparked the gradual development of the town into a regional centre of commerce. By the end of the following century the number of Jews grew significantly; the town was also one of the notable centre of Calvinism, sponsored by the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family. The first rabbi of Kletzk was Judah ben L√∂b, who also had under his jurisdiction the community of Mechit. He was succeeded by Michael ben Me√Ør Eisenstadt, who in turn was followed, about 1762, by his son Moses Eisenstadt (d. Oct. 25, 1795). According to a local legend, the philosopher Salomon Maimon had lived there for several years, and was intimate with Moses Eisenstadt. Until 1623 the town was a part of the powiat of Brze≈õƒá; after that date it was transferred, together with the neighbouring towns, to the district of Pinsk. According to tradition, the town originally was located on the opposite bank of the river, on the road leading to Lyakhovich; but after the destructive fire of 1705 it was rebuilt, at the instance of the Voivode, on its present site. In 1793, Kletsk was acquired by the Russian Empire as a result of the Second Partition of Poland. The town was repeatedly destroyed by fire in the 19th century, including in 1817, 1845, 1865, and 1886. In 1903 Kletsk had a total population of about 8,000, of which about 6,000 were Jews. From 1921 until 1939, Kletsk (Kleck) was part of the Second Polish Republic. The town was a parish (gmina) centre in Nie≈õwie≈º county (powiat) of Nowogr√≥dek Voivodeship. On 17 September 1939, Kletsk was occupied by the Red Army and, on 14 November 1939, incorporated into the Byelorussian SSR. From 26 June 1941 until 4 July 1944, Kletsk was occupied by Nazi Germany and administered as a part of the Generalbezirk Wei√üruthenien of Reichskommissariat Ostland. During the German occupation, a large massacre of local Jews took place in the town on October 6, 1941, with circa 4,000 people murdered.http://yahadmap.org/#village/kletsk-minsk-belarus.403 The remaining Jews of the area (approximately 2,000 people) were massed in a local ghetto and then sent to various German concentration camps by August 21, 1942. The Holocaust brought an end to a vibrant Jewish life. Among the monuments of the Jewish past destroyed during World War II were a Jewish cemetery, a large synagogue founded by Prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç in 1796; a bet ha-midrash built in the early 18th century and fifteen smaller houses of prayer. The former Dominican church dates from 1683. Orlovsky St. After the liberation of Kletsk by the Red Army on 4 July 1944, the town resumed its status as a part of the Byelorussian SSR. Since 1991, it has been a part of the independent Republic of Belarus.  Architecture  Before the last war, the town's oldest building was the mid-16th-century Trinity cathedral. It was seriously damaged during World War II and eventually blown up by the Soviets in the 1950s. Its ruins are still visible, however. Currently, the town's main architectural landmark is the Church of the Resurrection, which was built in the provincial Baroque style in 1683.

Nueva Helvecia (Spanish for \\"New Helvetia\\"; formerly known as Colonia Suiza) is west of Montevideo, the capital and largest city of Uruguay. It is a few kilometres from the coast where the Atlantic Ocean meets the R√≠o de la Plata and east of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It is known nationwide for its Swiss heritage. History =Swiss emigration= Europe was undergoing severe economic hardships during the second part of the 19th century. The Industrial Revolution affected many small artisans and family businesses. By law, Swiss mercenary soldiers could no longer fight for other countries and were returning home to find their families in precarious conditions that could not support any more members. The Americas represented a chance for progress and prosperity. Many Swiss came to North America during the California Gold Rush, but once the Civil War started in the United States, the Swiss emigrants started looking further south in Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay for a better future. In Brazil there was a law that foreigners could not own land. In Argentina the colonists settled in indigenous territory and were not welcome, but Uruguay's government had a relatively open immigration policy. They were desperate to populate the country, which had but a few inhabitants at the time. The Swiss colony was given autonomy, and the first democratic secret vote in Uruguay happened in Colonia Suiza. The Swiss immigrants helped shape many Uruguayan laws, giving Uruguay the name of \\"Switzerland of the Americas\\", among many other contributions such as the classical production of Swiss cheese, also known as \\"Queso Colonia\\". =Settlement= The first Swiss settler was David Salomon Bratschi from Bern. He arrived in 1858, three years earlier than the first large group of settlers who arrived at the end of 1861. However, the day of Nueva Helvecia's foundation is considered to be 24 April 1862. This date marks the time when a large number of immigrants, mostly from Switzerland, but with a significant number from Austria, Germany, Italy and France, settled in the area. The foundations of Colonia Suiza, Colonia Valdense, Colonia Miguelete, Rosario and other towns are the consequences of this European immigration. The name \\"Nueva Helvecia\\" was given to \\"Colonia Suiza\\" some decades later. The arrival of Swiss, Austrian, Italian, French, and German immigrants was important to the subsequent political organization of a country that was receptive to foreign influences. Uruguay offered a range of alternatives to immigrants, like fertile lands for agriculture and grassland for livestock productivity. Culture The people of Nueva Helvecia have maintained Swiss traditions and customs to this day. There are several groups, including \\"Los Alegres Alpinos\\", and the \\"Alpenveilchen Grupo de Danzas\\", who still practice the songs and dances of their ancestors. However, today, very few Nueva Helvecia residents speak the language of their ancestors, likely due to intermarriage with other populations. Even among Swiss the different dialects prevented them from communicating with each other unless they used the Spanish language. The holidays and festivities include: * The 25th of April, corresponding to the anniversary of the foundation of Nueva Helvecia * The 1st of August, corresponding to the anniversary of the formation of the Swiss Confederation. * The \\"Bierfest\\" in December attracts visitors from other departments and countries. Architecture The city, though located in Uruguay, shares a number of features and similarities with classical and early modern European architecture, mainly those of Switzerland, Germany and France, as a result of its close link with the cultures and societies of those countries. Unlike in other cities in Uruguay, every building bears a symbolic shield representing the different Swiss cantons where the family living in the house came from. This has become more evident in recent years. Attractions *Plaza de los Fundadores *Tiro Suizo *Hotel Suizo *OSE Watertank *Molino Quemado *Evangelical Church *Roman Catholic Church *Cine Helv√©tico Economy Dairy products, including milk, Swiss cheese, cream cheese, dulce de leche, and yogurt, dominate the city's economy. Nueva Helvecia also produces a variety of sausages and animal products, fruits and vegetables, cereals and wine. Until 1980 the Facansa enterprise produced bodywork for road vehicles. Location and population It is located in the southeastern part of Colonia Department, Uruguay. Its population, as of 2004, was 12,000.

Official full text of the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact (BothPolish and Russian). The Soviet‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact (, , translitterated in Dogovor o nenapadenii mezhdu SSSR i Pol'shey) was a non-aggression pact signed in 1932 by representatives of Poland and the Soviet Union. The pact was unilaterally broken by the Soviet Union on September 17, 1939, during the Soviet invasion of Poland. Background After the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War, the Polish authorities pursued a policy of \\"equal distance\\" between Germany and the Soviet Union. Most Polish politicians, both on the left and on the right, believed that Poland should rely mostly on the crucial Franco-Polish Military Alliance, which dated back to World War I, and not support either Germany or the Soviet Union. To normalise bilateral contacts with the Soviet Union, talks were started in January 1926 to prepare a non-aggression pact to fortify the Polish gains of the Peace of Riga that was to be balanced by a similar pact signed with Germany. However, the talks with Germany were not started, and the Polish‚ÄìSoviet talks were interrupted in June 1927, when Britain broke off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and Soviet plenipotentiary Pyotr Voykov was killed in Warsaw. Instead, Poland applied to the Briand-Kellogg Pact of 1928. Polish-Soviet negotiations were resumed in Moscow.in 1931. The pact was finally signed on July 25, 1932, effective for three years. Ratifications were exchanged in Warsaw on December 23, 1932, and the pact went into effect on the same day. It was registered in League of Nations Treaty Series on January 9, 1933.League of Nations Treaty Series, vol. 136, pp. 42-53. On May 5, 1934, it was extended to December 31, 1945 without amendment. Terms Both sides agreed to renounce violence in bilateral relations, to resolve their problems through negotiations and to forgo any armed conflict or alliances aimed at the other side. Aftermath On September 23, 1938, the Soviet Union sent a note to the Polish government to inform it that the pact would be considered null and void if Poland participated in the occupation of Czechoslovakia . However, the threat was not carried out since the Soviet government stated on October 31, after Poland had occupied Zaolzie area, that the pact remained in force , and the pact was reaffirmed by the two powers on November 26, 1938 (see ). It was finally broken by the Soviets on September 17, 1939, when the Soviet and German jointly invaded Poland, in accordance with the secret protocols of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. The pact was considered at the time as a major success of Polish diplomacy, which had been greatly weakened by the toll war with Germany, the renouncement of parts of the Treaty of Versailles and the loosened ties to France. The pact also reinforced the Polish negotiating position with Germany, which finally resulted in the signing of the German‚ÄìPolish Non-Aggression Pact 18 months later.

In 1979 a new agreement was formed - an International Natural Rubber Agreement. Background Demand for rubber declined sharply after World War I resulting in the British enacting the Stevenson Plan in 1922 to restrict the supply of rubber to support rubber prices and ensure the profitability of British rubber plantations in the Far East. However, the plan had many flaws and was abandoned in 1928. By 1928 the plan both irritated the United States and lacked apparent purpose. Demand for rubber was robust due to expanded use of the automobile in the United States. After the stock market crash of 1929 the Great Depression hit the United States and rubber demanded once again softened. It was in this context that the International Rubber Regulation Agreement was implemented. The Agreement The Agreement was enacted in 1934 between the United Kingdom, India, the Netherlands, France and Thailand to restrict the rubber supply in accordance with the decline of rubber prices to maintain rubber prices and profitability of rubber producing firms. The agreement both prevented establishment of new rubber plantations and placed production restrictions on existing plantations. The agreement in effect formed a cartel of rubber producing nations. To satisfy the interests of the opposite side, the rubber consuming nations, a new institutional body was established: a ‚ÄúConsumer Advisory Council‚Äù. Therein representatives of the three leading rubber consuming nations took place: For the United States this was ‚ÄûThe Rubber Manufacturers‚Äô Association of America\\", for Great Britain ‚ÄûThe India Rubber Manufacturers‚Äô Association of the United Kingdom\\" and for Germany the ‚ÄûReichsverband der deutschen Kautschukindustrie‚Äù.Lammers, Clemens (1937): Internationale Kartelle. Paris: Internationale Handelskammer, p. 12 (p. 9-18: ‚ÄúDie Organisation des Rohkautschukmarktes‚Äù = rubber cartel) Other countries, e.g. Japan or the Sowjetunion, had got no representation. Outcome The United States tried to become independent of the rubber cartel: establishing rubber plantations in territories under its control; conducting research into rubber-producing plants that thrive in the United States' climate; and reinvigorated efforts to replace natural rubber in tires with a synthetic. In the Fordlandia venture, Henry Ford failed in an attempt to produce rubber in Brazil. The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company developed plantations in the Philippines and Costa Rica and Harvey Firestone developed plantations in Liberia. Research into synthetic rubber was limited by lack of knowledge of the chemical structure of rubber compounds until after 1945. DuPont had developed neoprene in the 1920s in response to the Stevenson Plan, but neoprene was too costly for making tires. During this period the International Rubber Research & Development Board and the Research Association of British Rubber Manufacturers were founded. Also other technologically advanced countries like Germany and the Soviet Union developed in the interwar period synthetic rubber (e.g. Buna.Lammers, Clemens (1937): Internationale Kartelle.

He was the yabgu (vassal) of his brother Bumin Qaghan in 553 AD. He was posthumously referred to as khagan in Turkic sources. His son was Tardu.  Activities  During his rule Istami established diplomatic relations with the Persian and Byzantine Empires, defeated the Hepthalites, and acted as an elder statesman during the disintegration of the eastern half of the empire. We know a great deal about him from the diplomatic missions of the Byzantine Empire. Shortly after the smuggling of silkworm eggs into the Byzantine Empire from China by Nestorian Christian monks, the 6th-century Byzantine historian Menander Protector writes of how the Sogdians attempted to establish a direct trade of Chinese silk with the Byzantine Empire. After forming an alliance with the Sassanid ruler Khosrow I to defeat the Hephthalite Empire, Ist√§mi was approached by Sogdian merchants requesting permission to seek an audience with the Sassanid king of kings for the privilege of traveling through Persian territories in order to trade with the Byzantines.Howard, Michael C., Transnationalism in Ancient and Medieval Societies, the Role of Cross Border Trade and Travel, McFarland & Company, 2012, p. 133. Ist√§mi refused the first request, but when he sanctioned the second one and had the Sogdian embassy sent to the Sassanid king, the latter had the members of the embassy poisoned to death. Maniah, a Sogdian diplomat, convinced Ist√§mi to send an embassy directly to Byzantium's capital Constantinople, which arrived in 568 and offered not only silk as a gift to Byzantine ruler Justin II, but also proposed an alliance against Sassanid Persia. Justin II agreed and sent an embassy to the Turkic Khaganate, ensuring the direct silk trade desired by the Sogdians.Liu, Xinru, \\"The Silk Road: Overland Trade and Cultural Interactions in Eurasia\\", in Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History, ed. Michael Adas, American Historical Association, Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2001, p. 168. As the brother of Bumin he ruled the far-western region of their khanate. His son was Tardu. As a Yabghu, he was autonomous and had de facto sovereignty while officially recognizing the authority of the qaghan. After Khushu‚Äôs death he arranged the division of the territory into three realms east, central, and west and distributed them between Jotan, Arslan, and Shetu, respectively.

Its value, using the modern definition of prime,Copeland and Erd≈ës considered 1 a prime, and they defined the constant as 0.12357111317‚Ä¶ is approximately :0.235711131719232931374143‚Ä¶ . The constant is irrational; this can be proven with Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions or Bertrand's postulate (Hardy and Wright, p. 113) or Ramare's theorem that every even integer is a sum of at most six primes. It also follows directly from its normality (see below). By a similar argument, any constant created by concatenating \\"0.\\" with all primes in an arithmetic progression dn + a, where a is coprime to d and to 10, will be irrational. E.g. primes of the form 4n + 1 or 8n + 1\\\\. By Dirichlet's theorem, the arithmetic progression dn*10m + a contains primes for all m, and those primes are also in cd + a, so the concatenated primes contain arbitrarily long sequences of the digit zero. In base 10, the constant is a normal number, a fact proven by Arthur Herbert Copeland and Paul Erd≈ës in 1946 (hence the name of the constant). The constant is given by :\\\\displaystyle \\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty p_n 10^{-\\\\left(n + \\\\sum_{k=1}^n \\\\lfloor \\\\log_{10}{p_k} \\\\rfloor \\\\right)} where pn is the nth prime number. Its continued fraction is [0; 4, 4, 8, 16, 18, 5, 1, ‚Ä¶] (). Related constants Copeland and Erd≈ës's proof that their constant is normal relies only on the fact that p_n is strictly increasing and p_n = n^{1+o(1)}, where p_n is the nth prime number. More generally, if s_n is any strictly increasing sequence of natural numbers such that s_n = n^{1+o(1)} and b is any natural number greater than or equal to 2, then the constant obtained by concatenating \\"0.\\" with the base-b representations of the s_n's is normal in base b.

Its story involves the superhero team known as the Justice League of America confronting the supervillain team the Legion of Doom after every supervillain is motivated by a shared dream that seems to be a vision of the planet's destruction, which they intend to avoid. Development Coming off their previous project, Earth X from Marvel Comics, Alex Ross, Jim Krueger, and Doug Braithwaite started on Justice, a 12-issue bi-monthly series. Ross described the series as a full-on superhero war, the Super Friends versus the Legion of Doom, to the death. Ross had stated that, following Kingdom Come, he wanted to break away from the 1990s fixation with superhuman wars, and focused on The World's Greatest Super-Heroes. It was only following that that he could return to the war stories he is known for, like Kingdom Come. Story Several supervillains start having recurring nightmares where Earth is destroyed by a nuclear Armageddon that the Justice League of America fails to prevent. Believing that the League's overconfidence in their own abilities and the exaggerated faith humanity has in them will be their ruin, the villains decide to band together to destroy the Justice League and save the world as they see fit. Toyman, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and Captain Cold help solve the world's greatest problems, like hunger and physical disabilities, which turns public opinion against the Justice League. Meanwhile, Lex Luthor and Black Manta capture Aquaman and take him to an alien city located within a black sphere at the bottom of the sea, where he is left under the care of Brainiac. The Martian Manhunter locates him, as Aquaman has telepathically instructed the oceanic wildlife to form lines visible from space that point to his location. Before he can free Aquaman, the Manhunter is ambushed by Gorilla Grodd, who incapacitates him with a psychic attack. Batman captures The Riddler, who had stolen secret files about the Justice League's members' weaknesses from the Bat-Computer, and imprisons him in Arkham Asylum, but he is rescued by Luthor. In the process, the Joker finds out that he hasn't been invited to Luthor's secret society of supervillains and becomes furious. Red Tornado eventually finds clues that might lead to Aquaman's location, but is surprised by a traitor among the Justice League's ranks, who destroys him and gives Grodd access to the Watchtower's computers and its members' secret identities. Superman is attacked by Metallo, Parasite, Bizarro and Solomon Grundy. He emits a call for help that the Flash tries to answer, only to find out he has been poisoned by Captain Cold and is being forced to run non-stop until he dies from exhaustion. Wonder Woman is poisoned by Cheetah with the blood of a Centaur, and starts to revert to the clay from which she was born. The Green Lantern is ambushed by Sinestro and teleported to the end of the Universe; without enough energy to return, Hal transforms himself into pure energy and stores himself inside his power ring in order to survive. Green Arrow and Black Canary are attacked by Scarecrow and Clayface, while Hawkman and Hawkwoman are surprised by Toyman and the Atom is shot by Giganta. Luthor, the Riddler, Poison Ivy and Black Manta invite everyone who wishes to join them to live in alien cities contained within black spheres, secretly provided by Brainiac, who lobotomizes Aquaman. Superman's call for help is answered by Captain Marvel, who singlehandedly dispatches Superman's aggressors. Marvel takes Superman to the Batcave, and discovers that both Superman and Batman have been infected with mechanical worms. These worms had mind controlled Batman into destroying Red Tornado. Captain Marvel throws Superman into the Sun, destroying the worms. They head to the Watchtower to get some answers, but it explodes before they can board it. Captain Marvel and Superman work out a plan to save the Flash. Marvel uses the speed of Mercury to catch up to the Flash and knocks him off balance with his magic lightning bolt. The plan nearly kills both Captain Marvel and the Flash, but Superman is able to save them. The Martian Manhunter regains control of his body and calls Zatanna to help save Aquaman and Red Tornado. They retrieve Aquaman's body from Brainiac's city and take it to Dr. Niles Caulder, leader of the Doom Patrol, who saves him and returns him to life. They recover Red Tornado's remains from the destroyed Watchtower and have them fixed by Doc Magnus, leader of the Metal Men. From there, they warn Hawkman and Hawkwoman, who had defeated Toyman, that his hideout is located in Midway City, where they find out that he is building robotic bodies for Brainiac, and have the Phantom Stranger rescue Green Lantern. Green Arrow, Black Canary, the Atom, Plastic Man, Elongated Man, Metamorpho, the Metal Men and the Doom Patrol are all called to Superman's Fortress of Solitude in the Arctic. Batman is found by Wonder Woman, who is able to return him to sanity with her magic lasso. They capture Captain Cold, who reveals the truth: The dream was fabricated by Luthor, Brainiac and Grodd to create a Legion of Doom and use them to destroy the Justice League. The mechanical worms were stolen designs from Dr. Sivana, based on Mr. Mind's powers, and Brainiac lobotomized Aquaman to find out if his brain could be used to control Grodd. It couldn't, but his baby son's can, and Black Manta kidnaps him. Black Adam also joins Luthor's cabal. The heroes' sidekicks are mind-controlled by the worms and their loved ones are abducted. They discover that the worms are actually turning humans into robots as part of Brainiac's plan to mechanize the Universe, and attack Luthor's city to stop their plans, using armor that protects them from the worms. After a big battle, most of the villains are defeated, but Brainiac, Scarecrow, Poison Ivy, Cheetah and Black Manta escape. John Stewart is given Jordan's ring and uses it to erase the heroes' secret identities from everyone's minds and to destroy the worms. He returns the ring to Hal and they capture the remaining villains and stop Brainiac, who takes control of Earth's nuclear arsenals in order to bring about the nuclear Armaggedon from the nightmare. Meanwhile, the Joker sabotages Luthor's cities and takes down the Scarecrow. Aquaman, Wonder Woman and the Atom quickly take down Black Manta, Cheetah and Poison Ivy, leaving only Brainiac at large. After a drawn-out battle, Superman, Red Tornado and Zatanna defeat the villain while the Green Lantern Corps prevents the nuclear Armaggedon. Luthor, Brainiac and the others are imprisoned and Wonder Woman is taken to Themyscira, the Paradise-Island, where her mother, Queen Hippolyta, restores her with the help of the Gods. All returns to normal, but Batman wonders if the Justice League will, one day, really accomplish world peace. Meanwhile, in Metropolis, Superman is observed by the Legion of Super-Heroes from the 31st century, a Utopian future, proving that they will succeed one day. Continuity Justice takes place outside of the regular DC Universe continuity, with most of the characters featured in the story being modern day incarnations of their Silver Age of comic books counterparts. The series heavily draws upon the 1970s Super Friends animated series, most notably the Challenge of the Super Friends incarnation, which featured the Legion of Doom as regular characters. In an interview, Alex Ross jokingly compared the series to the All-Star Batman and Robin, the Boy Wonder and All-Star Superman, two comics which like Justice take place outside the existing DC Universe. All three titles launched within the same time period as part of a wave of continuity-free incarnations of popular DC Universe properties, though Justice did not feature the \\"All-Star\\" labeling. Characters The story focused on the Justice League centric storyline, though other characters from the DC Universe appear in supporting roles. =Justice League of America= The roster of the Justice League of America in the story are mostly based on the incarnation of the team seen in the 1970s and early 1980s, commonly referred to as the Justice League Satellite era. *Superman *Batman *Wonder Woman *The Flash *Green Lantern *Martian Manhunter *Aquaman *Green Arrow *Hawkman *Hawkwoman *Atom *Black Canary *Captain Marvel *Elongated Man *Metamorpho *Phantom Stranger *Plastic Man *Red Tornado *Zatanna =Other heroes= *Doom Patrol (the Silver Age incarnation) *Doc Magnus *John Stewart *Metal Men *Teen Titans (featuring their Silver Age incarnation) *Supergirl *Batgirl *Captain Marvel, Jr. *Mary Marvel *Legion of Super-Heroes =Legion of Doom roster= The supervillain team isn't based on any one from the comics, but instead based on the villain group from the Super Friends television series.

Baer begins with his upbringing in the United States and Europe and continues with a tour of his CIA experiences across the globe. Approximately the first two-thirds of the memoir focus on the various experiences of Baer's two-decade (1976‚Äì1997) career at the CIA, while the last third depicts the growing cynicism brought on by the corruption and obliviousness encountered in Washington. One of the main focal points of the story is Baer's obsession with uncovering the perpetrators of the unsolved 1983 United States Embassy bombing in Beirut, Lebanon. Baer's memoir describes his own solution of the mystery. The overall theme around which the memoir is built is his view of the CIA losing its prowess due to increasing diplomatic sensitivity in Washington's foreign policies in the aftermath of political fiascoes from active American involvement in foreign politics in the 1970s and 1980s. Baer describes how he believes the CIA steadily degenerated from a potent human-intelligence resource that often saved or spared lives, to a people-shy, satellite-obsessed, and politically oriented branch of a centralized government. Other topics Baer discusses in the book include: the extent to which the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been involved in anti- American terrorist activity, most publicly in the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing (a death toll of over 300), but allegedly in a far more diverse range of terrorist operations. Baer also writes about how he believes the CIA failed in forecasting the September 11 attacks on America. Baer's story clearly lays out how the CIA came to the point of not even having a useful agent in the Middle East in the period leading up to the attacks. He goes on to describe the loss of effectiveness of the CIA in the mid-1990s, in the wake of the catastrophic treason of CIA officer Aldrich Ames, and the CIA's failure to identify the mole before lethal damage had been done to many of their operations worldwide. The final section of the memoir deals with Baer's experience with oil politics in Washington, and the extended reach granted to oil's agenda by the politically fixated and strategically oblivious American government. At one point, Baer is stunned at being asked to approve the sale of a sophisticated American defense weapon to a former Soviet-bloc country as an incentive for participating in an oil deal, while that same country had recently obstructed the investigation of the murder of an American diplomat on their soil. Baer recalls his unwilling association with infamous oil businessman Roger Tamraz and the uneasy realities he extracts from his period of involvement in Washington politics.

The primitive was suggested by Moni Naor and Moti Yung and is also known as \\"target collision resistant\\" hash functions; it was employed to construct general digital signature schemes without trapdoor functions, and also within chosen-ciphertext secure public key encryption schemes. The UOWHF family contains a finite number of hash functions with each having the same probability of being used. Definition The security property of a UOWHF is as follows. Let A be an algorithm that operates in two phases: * Initially, A receives no input (or, just a security parameter) and chooses a value x. * A hash function H is chosen randomly from the family. A then receives H and must output y e x such that H(x) = H(y). Then for all polynomial-time A the probability that A succeeds is negligible. Applications UOWHFs are thought to be less computationally expensive than CRHFs, and are most often used for efficiency purposes in schemes where the choice of the hash function happens at some stage of execution, rather than beforehand. For instance, the Cramer‚ÄìShoup cryptosystem uses a UOWHF as part of the validity check in its ciphertexts.

Murray, a son of the great West Indian batsman Everton Weekes, often courted controversy. A marijuana user from a young age, he was almost thrown out of the 1975‚Äì76 tour to Australia, only saved by the intervention of the sympathetic senior player Lance Gibbs. His drug habit was reportedly fuelled by a tour of India where he found drugs easily available: \\"A waiter at the team hotel started the whole thing.

After developing as an off-spinner, Nanan made the Trinidad and Tobago youth representative teams in 1969 and 1970, and toured England with the West Indies youth team in 1970. His continual success in youth cricket, including winning the Learie Constantine Trophy for being the most outstanding all rounder at the 1972 West Indies Youth Championships, led to Nanan making his first-class cricket debut for Trinidad and Tobago in 1972/73. Senior cricket career Playing for Trinidad and Tobago for almost two decades, Nanan was the most successful bowler in West Indies domestic cricket history, taking 366 first-class wickets at 23.

The game was first released for MS-DOS on September 26, 1990 and was later ported to the Amiga, CD32 (256-color), Sega CD and the Super Nintendo, and re-released for the PC as Wing Commander I in 1994. An enhanced remake Super Wing Commander was made for the 3DO in 1994, later ported to the Macintosh. The game was a marked departure from the standard formula, bringing space combat to a level approaching the Star Wars films. Set in the year 2654 and characterized by Chris Roberts as \\"World War II in space\\", it features a multinational cast of pilots from the \\"Terran Confederation\\" flying missions against the predatory, aggressive Kilrathi, a feline warrior race (heavily inspired by the Kzinti of Larry Niven's Known Space universe). Gameplay Screenshot showing the cockpit of the player's ship and a targeted enemy in an outer space setting. Gameplay consists of completing successive missions and overall cockpit performance affects gameplay: going above and beyond the call of duty results in medals, promotions in rank are awarded at regular intervals, and success or failure on certain critical missions decides the player's plot progress, \\"winning\\" or \\"losing\\". Plot =Wing Commander= The player takes the role of a nameless pilot aboard the TCS Tiger's Claw, a Bengal-class Strike Carrier. The player gets to name the pilot and choose his call sign. The pilot (known in-production to Origin personnel as \\"Bluehair\\", after his most notable feature) quickly rises through the ranks of the flight wing and (presuming the player performs ideally in the cockpit) eventually leads a strike on the Kilrathi High Command starbase in the Venice system. On the other hand, if the player does not perform optimally, missions become increasingly defensive in nature, and eventually the Claw is forced to retreat. Of the two endings, the \\"winning\\" path is established as canon by the game's two expansion packs, as well as the sequel, Wing Commander II: Vengeance of the Kilrathi. =Wing Commander: The Secret Missions= In the add-on's plot, the Tiger's Claw, on maneuvers in the Goddard System, receives an abortive distress call from Goddard colony. When the Claw arrives, though, nothing is left but wreckage and corpses; a quarter of a million colonists have been killed. Confed realizes that this is the work of a new Kilrathi weapon, the \\"Graviton weapon\\", which is able to increase the power of gravity by over a hundred times. Clever work by the Claw's crew and pilots allows them to capture a Kilrathi courier ship, which reveals that this weapon is mounted on an entirely new class of ship; CNC codenames it the Sivar-class dreadnought, after the Kilrathi god of war. Bluehair leads the strike against the Sivar and destroys it in the Vigrid system; for unexplained reasons, ships of that class and armament are never seen again. =Wing Commander: The Secret Missions 2: Crusade= In the add-on's plot, the Tiger's Claw is in the Firekka System, whose native intelligent lifeforms ‚Äî the bird-like Firekkans ‚Äî are negotiating to join the Terran Confederation. Tensions are high, and will only get higher. There is an unusual Kilrathi presence in the area, including their upgraded Dralthi II and ships that have never been seen before: the Hhriss-class heavy fighter and the Snakeir-class heavy carrier. This presence develops into a massive battle group, and though the Firekkans sign the Articles of the Confederation, the outnumbered Terrans have no choice but to retreat. Adding to the mess, a Kilrathi lord, Ralgha nar Hhallas, defects, bringing his Fralthi-class cruiser, the Ras Nik'hra, and word of a rebellion against the Empire on the Kilrathi colony of Ghorah Khar. Finally, almost overlooked in all the chaos, Major Kien \\"Bossman\\" Chen is lost while flying on Jeannette Devereaux's wing; the nearby TCS Austin transfers over two pilots, Lieutenants Zachary \\"Jazz\\" Colson and Etienne \\"Doomsday\\" Montclair. All this happens in the first six missions of the game. The Kilrathi presence in the Firekka sector is eventually explained by an all-channels transmission from the Crown Prince of the Kilrathi Empire, Thrakhath nar Kiranka: Firekka has been chosen as the site of this year's Rite of Sivar, a religious festival that involves live sacrifices. Seeing the chance to strike a heady blow to Kilrathi morale, the Confederation assigns its Firekka-sector resources the task of disrupting the ceremony. The Dralthi medium fighters from the Ras Nik'hra are put to work on reconnaissance missions (conveniently, the Confederation Scimitar medium fighter is retired at the beginning of the expansion pack, opening a space in the database of Confederation fighters for the Dralthi), and Terran troops begin landing in secret. Between these, the Firekkans' warrior spirit and some of the Confederation's best pilots and tacticians, the Sivar ceremony is utterly wrecked and the Kilrathi forced to retreat, though they take a number of important Firekkans with them as hostages. Ralgha and the rebellion at Ghorah Khar, though promising, are taken over by Confed Intelligence and do not see mention until the first expansion pack for Wing Commander II. At the end of Crusade, Jeannette Devereaux is detailed off to the TCS Austin, where she will serve as Wing Commander. Interested in the other half of the crusade, Mercedes Lackey and Ellen Guon penned the first Wing Commander novel, Wing Commander: Freedom Flight. It tells the Firekkan side of the story, from several points of view: Ralgha nar Hhallas, Ian \\"Hunter\\" St. John, James \\"Paladin\\" Taggart, and K'kai, a Firekkan flock leader. =Super Wing Commander= Super Wing Commander was a drastic new look at the events of the original Wing Commander. That mission led the Tiger's Claw to track down and destroy the shipyards responsible for creating the Sivar Dreadnought. Additional background elements rumors about stealth fighters and Admiral Tolwyn were added to improve the continuity with Wing Commander II. Next Generation reviewed the 3DO version of the game, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that \\"Super Wing Commander succeeds at being what it was intended to be - a straightforward space simulator with an arcade spin.\\" History =Development= Wing Commander was originally titled Squadron and later renamed Wingleader. As development for Wing Commander came to a close, the EMM386 memory manager the game used would give an exception when the user exited the game. It would print out a message similar to \`\\"EMM386 Memory manager error...\\"\` with additional information. The team could not isolate and fix the error and they needed to ship it as soon as possible. As a work-around, one of the game's programmers, Ken Demarest, hex- edited the memory manager so it displayed a different message. Instead of the error message, it printed \`\\"Thank you for playing Wing Commander.\\"\` Republished online: However, due to a different bug the game went through another revision and the bug was fixed, meaning this hack did not ship with the final release. =Release= Wing Commander shipped in 1990 for PC/DOS as the initial platform and came with an instruction booklet styled as a shipboard magazine, Claw Marks. It provided tactical suggestions, statistics on fighters and weapons both Kilrathi and Terran, capsule biographies of notable pilots on both sides of the line, and general shipboard news (such as the discontinuation of the popular comic strip Hornet's Nest, due to the recent death of its artist, Lt. Larry \\"Tooner\\" Dibbles). Notable contributors to the Claw Marks magazine include Captain Aaron Allston, Major Warren Spector, and Col. Chris Roberts. The game also shipped with a set of blueprints for the game's four playable fighters, the Hornet, Scimitar, Rapier, and Raptor. Mission packs In 1990, an add-on campaign, named Wing Commander: The Secret Missions, was released, adding new missions, new ships, a new storyline, and an increase in difficulty. Unlike the original game, The Secret Missions does not feature a branching mission tree; every player plays the same missions in the same order. However, if the player does not fulfill the mission requirements at any system, he immediately plays the two losing \\"retreat\\" missions that are not on the winning path. The Secret Missions was also released for the SNES as a stand-alone cartridge. The second expansion pack for Wing Commander, Wing Commander: The Secret Missions 2: Crusade adds a new narrative, new ships, more difficult missions, and two new wingmen. It was released in 1991. Ports and re-release Wing Commander was ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Amiga in 1992, to the Amiga CD32 in 1993, and to the Sega CD system in 1994. In 1994, Wing Commander was retroactively renamed Wing Commander I in a bundled re- release together with Wing Commander II, in preparation for the release of Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger. The rebundled remakes do not contain and do not support the Secret Missions addons. In 1996 Wing Commander was ported to Windows 95 in a bundled re-release together with Wing Commander II, and Wing Commander III: Heart of the Tiger known as Wing Commander: The Kilrathi Saga. All three games were ported to Windows 95 and the Secret Missions Addons whilst not shipped on the CDs could be downloaded from Origin's website. Super Wing Commander Screenshot showing vastly improved graphics. Super Wing Commander; released on March 23, 1994, for 3DO and Macintosh; was a drastic new look at the events of the original Wing Commander game with enhanced graphics and full speech. The game also contained both Secret Missions and a special third campaignWing Commander CIC SWC Script was also created between them (called \\"Secret Mission 1.5\\" by fans). =Legacy= Chris Crawford said of Wing Commander that it \\"raised the bar for the whole industry,\\" as the game was five times more expensive to create than most of its contemporaries. Because the game was highly successful, other publishers had to match its production value in order to compete. This forced a large portion of the video game industry to become more conservative, as larger budgets required greater sales to be profitable and the possibility of large losses dictated a decrease in the chance of that outcome, an aspect of classic risk-and-return dynamics. Crawford opined that Wing Commander in particular affected the marketing and economics of computer games and reestablished the \\"action game\\" as the most lucrative type of computer game. In 2006 Electronic Arts ported the SNES version of Wing Commander to the PlayStation Portable as part of EA Replay, released in the United States on November 14, 2006. In August 2011, after many years of unavailability, the Wing Commander I PC version was re-released into the digital distribution on gog.com. The long lost source code of Wing Commander I was given to the fan- community in August 2011 by a former developer for the purpose of long-time preservation. Reception Wing Commander became a best seller and caused the development of competing space combat games, such as LucasArts' X-Wing. It was very well received by critics. Dragon gave Wing Commander six stars, out of a five-star system, the Secret Missions Expansion Disk receiving five stars. Computer Gaming World in 1990 described the game as a \\"stellar warfare adventure in every sense of the word\\", praising its graphics, story, and music. The magazine described the first expansion as \\"more of the same\\", albeit more difficult, but the second as improving computer pilots' intelligence. In a 1992 survey of science fiction games, the magazine gave the title five of five stars, stating that \\"the richness of the entire package makes this a 'must-have'\\". A 1994 survey of strategic space games set in the year 2000 and later gave the game four-plus stars out of five. Its readers gave Wing Commander a score of 10.91, the highest rating in the history of the magazine until 1992, when it was superseded by the sequel Wing Commander II; that year the magazine added Wing Commander to its Hall of Fame for games that readers highly rated over time. GamePro gave the Sega CD version a positive review, commenting that \\"A great story line with cinematic animation and digitized speech gives this game the feel of a big screen space opera.\\" They regarded the Super Wing Commander remake for the 3DO to be \\"a tedious disappointment\\", citing missions that are \\"either too short or too repetitive\\", dramatic slowdown which interferes with the gameplay, poorly animated character faces, and low quality voice tracks. In 1991, Wing Commander won Computer Gaming Worlds Overall Game of the Year award. In 1996 the magazine ranked it as the seventh best PC video game of all time, also listing the game's Game Over funeral cutscene among the 15 best ways to die in computer gaming. In 2011, Maximum PC included it on the list 16 classic games that need to be remade today, stating: \\"Chris Roberts and Origin really nailed the space opera with this series, which blended fast action and a fairly engaging (if hokey) story. Way ahead of its time.\\"Maximum PC  Facebook, Android, or Windows? 16 Gaming Classics That Need to Be Remade Today In 2012, Time named Wing Commander one of the 100 greatest video games of all time, remembering its \\"unprecedented detail\\" of graphics and calling it \\"a revelation in 1990 for PC space-sim buffs looking for a little less Star Trek and a little more Star Wars from the genre.\\" In 1991, PC Format placed Wing Commander on its list of the 50 best computer games of all time. The editors praised its \\"superb graphics, atmospheric storyline and [the] sheer hectic pace of the dogfighting.\\" In 1994, PC Gamer US named the game's CD-ROM release the 23rd best computer game ever. The editors wrote, \\"If Wing Commander were just a dog-fighting arcade game, it would still be great. But it's a lot more than that, as it combines animated sequences, voice acting, and a great story to create the first example of that now-overused phrase, 'Interactive Cinema.' \\" In 1991 it won the Origins Award for Best Fantasy or Science Fiction Computer Game of 1990.

Wendy and Lucy was also placed at #87 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s, and also appeared on many \\"Top 10 Films of 2008\\" lists, including those of the Chicago Reader, New York Post, Newsweek, The Austin Chronicle, LA Weekly, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Seattle Post- Intelligencer, Entertainment Weekly, The New York Times, The Oregonian, Slate, The Village Voice, and The Christian Science Monitor. In 2012, Raymond also published a second novel, Rain Dragon, which revolves around the character of Damon and his girlfriend Amy, who have had enough of Los Angeles and decide to leave the city to work on a community farm. Screenwriting Raymond has co- written, with the director Kelly Reichardt, the screenplays for two of her films based on his short stories: Old Joy and Wendy and Lucy. For Old Joy, he was nominated, along with the director and producers of the film, for a John Cassavetes Award from the 2007 Independent Spirit Awards. Raymond also wrote the screenplay for Reichardt's 2010 western Meek's Cutoff, which competed for the Golden Lion at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. Raymond was nominated for a Humanitas Prize at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival for his screenplay, and the film received a \\"Best Film\\" nomination from the 2011 Gotham Independent Film Awards. Raymond again worked with Reichardt on the screenplay for her film Night Moves in 2013. The film was shown in the main competition section of the 70th Venice International Film Festival in 2013 and at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival. Raymond collaborated on the screenplay for another of Reichardt's films, First Cow which premiered at the Telluride Film Festival in 2019. The film was also chosen to compete for the Golden Bear in the main competition section at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival in 2020. Teleplays and TV writing Raymond also co-wrote all the teleplays (all five episodes) for the 2011 five-part HBO miniseries, Mildred Pierce, directed and also co-written by Todd Haynes based on James M. Cain's novel, and starring Kate Winslet as the title character, as well as Guy Pearce, Melissa Leo, Evan Rachel Wood and others. For his writing work on the show, Raymond was nominated for a Primetime Emmy for \\"Outstanding Writing for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special\\" (shared with Todd Haynes). Other work Raymond's professional duties include co-editing Tin House, editing Plazm, art criticism for Artforum and Modern Painters, and teaching through The New School. Raymond‚Äôs writing has also appeared in Bookforum, the Village Voice, and other publications. Raymond has also produced the 2012 feature film, Buoy, directed by Steven Doughton and starring Matthew Del Negro and Tina Holmes. He has also served as the assistant to Writer/Director Todd Haynes on the set of his 2002 film, Far From Heaven, starring Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid. Raymond used the name \\"Slats Grobnik\\" (a character created by Chicago newspaper columnist Mike Royko) when he worked as Haynes' assistant on Far From Heaven, and Roger Ebert noticed this deep in the credits and wrote about it in his \\"Movie Yearbook 2004.\\"Id.

It is also one of the main tools in the study of the spectrum of the Laplace operator, and is thus of some auxiliary importance throughout mathematical physics. The heat kernel represents the evolution of temperature in a region whose boundary is held fixed at a particular temperature (typically zero), such that an initial unit of heat energy is placed at a point at time t = 0\\\\. Fundamental solution of the one- dimensional heat equation. Red: time course of \\\\Phi(x,t). Blue: time courses of \\\\Phi(x_0,t) for two selected points. Interactive version. The most well- known heat kernel is the heat kernel of d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd, which has the form of a time-varying Gaussian function, :K(t,x,y) = \\\\frac{1}{(4\\\\pi t)^{d/2}} e^{-x-y^2/4t}\\\\, This solves the heat equation :\\\\frac{\\\\partial K}{\\\\partial t}(t,x,y) = \\\\Delta_x K(t,x,y)\\\\, for all t > 0 and x,y ‚àà Rd, where Œî is the Laplacian operator, with the initial condition :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} K(t,x,y) = \\\\delta(x-y)=\\\\delta_x(y) where Œ¥ is a Dirac delta distribution and the limit is taken in the sense of distributions. To wit, for every smooth function œÜ of compact support, :\\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0}\\\\int_{\\\\mathbf{R}^d} K(t,x,y)\\\\phi(y)\\\\,dy = \\\\phi(x). On a more general domain Œ© in Rd, such an explicit formula is not generally possible. The next simplest cases of a disc or square involve, respectively, Bessel functions and Jacobi theta functions. Nevertheless, the heat kernel (for, say, the Dirichlet problem) still exists and is smooth for t > 0 on arbitrary domains and indeed on any Riemannian manifold with boundary, provided the boundary is sufficiently regular. More precisely, in these more general domains, the heat kernel for the Dirichlet problem is the solution of the initial boundary value problem : \\\\begin{align} & \\\\frac{\\\\partial K}{\\\\partial t}(t,x,y) = \\\\Delta K(t,x,y) \\\\text{ for all } t>0 \\\\text{ and } x,y\\\\in\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & \\\\lim_{t \\\\to 0} K(t,x,y) = \\\\delta_x(y) \\\\text{ for all } x,y\\\\in\\\\Omega \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[6pt] & K(t,x,y) = 0, \\\\quad x\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega \\\\text{ or } y\\\\in\\\\partial\\\\Omega. \\\\end{align} It is not difficult to derive a formal expression for the heat kernel on an arbitrary domain. Consider the Dirichlet problem in a connected domain (or manifold with boundary) U. Let Œªn be the eigenvalues for the Dirichlet problem of the Laplacian :\\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{ll} \\\\Delta \\\\phi + \\\\lambda \\\\phi = 0 & \\\\text{in } U\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\phi=0 & \\\\text{on }\\\\ \\\\partial U. \\\\end{array}\\\\right. Let œÜn denote the associated eigenfunctions, normalized to be orthonormal in L2(U). The inverse Dirichlet Laplacian Œî‚àí1 is a compact and selfadjoint operator, and so the spectral theorem implies that the eigenvalues satisfy :0 < \\\\lambda_1 < \\\\lambda_2\\\\le \\\\lambda_3\\\\le\\\\cdots,\\\\quad \\\\lambda_n\\\\to\\\\infty. The heat kernel has the following expression: Formally differentiating the series under the sign of the summation shows that this should satisfy the heat equation. However, convergence and regularity of the series are quite delicate. The heat kernel is also sometimes identified with the associated integral transform, defined for compactly supported smooth œÜ by :T\\\\phi = \\\\int_\\\\Omega K(t,x,y)\\\\phi(y)\\\\,dy. The spectral mapping theorem gives a representation of T in the form :T = e^{t\\\\Delta}. There are several geometric results on heat kernels on manifolds; say, short-time asymptotics, long-time asymptotics, and upper/lower bounds of Gaussian type.

For example, nitrogen, methane, ethane, propane, and isobutane constitute a zeotropic mixture. Individual substances within the mixture do not evaporate or condense at the same temperature as one substance. In other words, the mixture has a temperature glide, as the phase change occurs in a temperature range of about four to seven degrees Celsius, rather than at a constant temperature. On temperature-composition graphs, this temperature glide can be seen as the temperature difference between the bubble point and dew point. For zeotropic mixtures, the temperatures on the bubble (boiling) curve are between the individual component's boiling temperatures. When a zeotropic mixture is boiled or condensed, the composition of the liquid and the vapor changes according to the mixtures's temperature-composition diagram. Zeotropic mixtures have different characteristics in nucleate and convective boiling, as well as in the organic Rankine cycle. Because zeotropic mixtures have different properties than pure fluids or azeotropic mixtures, zeotropic mixtures have many unique applications in industry, namely in distillation, refrigeration, and cleaning processes.  Dew and bubble points  Figure 1: Temperature-Composition diagram of a zeotropic mixturePadleckas, H. (2010-11-10). Wikimedia Commons. In mixtures of substances, the bubble point is the saturated liquid temperature, whereas the saturated vapor temperature is called the dew point. Because the bubble and dew lines of a zeotropic mixture's temperature-composition diagram do not intersect, a zeotropic mixture in its liquid phase has a different fraction of a component than the gas phase of the mixture. On a temperature-composition diagram, after a mixture in its liquid phase is heated to the temperature at the bubble (boiling) curve, the fraction of a component in the mixture changes along an isothermal line connecting the dew curve to the boiling curve as the mixture boils. At any given temperature, the composition of the liquid is the composition at the bubble point, whereas the composition of the vapor is the composition at the dew point. Unlike azeotropic mixtures, there is no azeotropic point at any temperature on the diagram where the bubble line and dew lines would intersect. Thus, the composition of the mixture will always change between the bubble and dew point component fractions upon boiling from a liquid to a gas until the mass fraction of a component reaches 1 (i.e. the zeotropic mixture is completely separated into its pure components). As shown in Figure 1, the mole fraction of component 1 decreases from 0.4 to around 0.15 as the liquid mixture boils to the gas phase. = Temperature glides = Different zeotropic mixtures have different temperature glides. For example, zeotropic mixture R152a/R245fa has a higher temperature glide than R21/R245fa. A larger gap between the boiling points creates a larger temperature glide between the boiling curve and dew curve at a given mass fraction. However, with any zeotropic mixture, the temperature glide decreases when the mass fraction of a component approaches 1 or 0 (i.e. when the mixture is almost separated into its pure components) because the boiling and dew curves get closer near these mass fractions. A larger difference in boiling points between the substances also affects the dew and bubble curves of the graph. A larger difference in boiling points creates a larger shift in mass fractions when the mixture boils at a given temperature. = Zeotropic vs. azeotropic mixtures = Figure 2: Bubble and Dew Curves for Zeotropic MixturesWilfried, C. (2011-10-18). Wikimedia Commons. Azeotropic and zeotropic mixtures have different dew and bubble curves characteristics in a temperature-composition graph. Namely, azeotropic mixtures have dew and bubble curves that intersect, but zeotropic mixtures do not. In other words, zeotropic mixtures have no azeotropic points. An azeotropic mixture that is near its azeotropic point has negligible zeotropic behavior and is near-azeotropic rather than zeotropic. Zeotropic mixtures differ from azeotropic mixtures in that the vapor and liquid phases of an azeotropic mixture have the same fraction of constituents. This is due to the constant boiling point of the azeotropic mixture.  Boiling  When superheating a substance, nucleate pool boiling and convective flow boiling occur when the temperature of the surface used to heat a liquid is higher than the liquid's boiling point by the wall superheat. = Nucleate pool boiling = The characteristics of pool boiling are different for zeotropic mixtures than that of pure mixtures. For example, the minimum superheating needed to achieve this boiling is greater for zeotropic mixtures than for pure liquids because of the different proportions of individual substances in the liquid versus gas phases of the zeotropic mixture. Zeotropic mixtures and pure liquids also have different critical heat fluxes. In addition, the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures are less than the ideal values predicted using the coefficients of pure liquids. This decrease in heat transfer is due to the fact that the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures do not increase proportionately with the mass fractions of the mixture's components. = Convective flow boiling = Zeotropic mixtures have different characteristics in convective boiling than pure substances or azeotropic mixtures. Overall, zeotropic mixtures transfer heat more efficiently at the bottom of the fluid, whereas pure and azeotropic substances transfer heat better at the top. During convective flow boiling, the thickness of the liquid film is less at the top of the film than at the bottom because of gravity. In the case of pure liquids and azeotropic mixtures, this decrease in thickness causes a decrease in the resistance to heat transfer. Thus, more heat is transferred and the heat transfer coefficient is higher at the top of the film. The opposite occurs for zeotropic mixtures. The decrease in film thickness near the top causes the component in the mixture with the higher boiling point to decrease in mass fraction. Thus, the resistance to mass transfer increases near the top of the liquid. Less heat is transferred, and the heat transfer coefficient is lower than at the bottom of the liquid film. Because the bottom of the liquid transfers heat better, it requires a lower wall temperature near the bottom than at the top to boil the zeotropic mixture. = Heat transfer coefficient = From low cryogenic to room temperatures, the heat transfer coefficients of zeotropic mixtures are sensitive to the mixture's composition, the diameter of the boiling tube, heat and mass fluxes, and the roughness of the surface. In addition, diluting the zeotropic mixture reduces the heat transfer coefficient. Decreasing the pressure when boiling the mixture only increases the coefficient slightly. Using grooved rather than smooth boiling tubes increases the heat transfer coefficient.  Distillation  Figure 3 Distillation Column.Petrus, Anthony (2009-11-01). Wikimedia commons. Feed mixture enters from the middle of the column. Low-boiling component collects in the top rectifying section, while high-boiling component collects in the bottom stripping section. The ideal case of distillation uses zeotropic mixtures. Zeotropic fluid and gaseous mixtures can be separated by distillation due to the difference in boiling points between the component mixtures. This process involves the use of vertically-arranged distillation columns (see Figure 2). = Distillation columns = When separating zeotropic mixtures with three or greater liquid components, each distillation column removes only the lowest-boiling point component and the highest boiling point component. In other words, each column separates two components purely. If three substances are separated with a single column, the substance with the intermediate boiling point will not be purely separated, and a second column would be needed. To separate mixtures consisting of multiple substances, a sequence of distillation columns must be used. This multi-step distillation process is also called rectification. In each distillation column, pure components form at the top (rectifying section) and bottom (stripping section) of the column when the starting liquid (called feed composition) is released in the middle of the column. This is shown in Figure 2. At a certain temperature, the component with the lowest boiling point (called distillate or overhead fraction) vaporizes and collects at the top of the column, whereas the component with the highest boiling point (called bottoms or bottom fraction) collects at the bottom of the column. In a zeotropic mixture, where more than one component exists, individual components move relative to each other as vapor flows up and liquid falls down. The separation of mixtures can be seen in a concentration profile. In a concentration profile, the position of a vapor in the distillation column is plotted against the concentration of the vapor. The component with the highest boiling point has a max concentration at the bottom of the column, where the component with the lowest boiling point has a max concentration at the top of the column. The component with the intermediate boiling point has a max concentration in the middle of the distillation column. Because of how these mixtures separate, mixtures with greater than three substances require more than one distillation column to separate the components. = Distillation configurations = Many configurations can be used to separate mixtures into the same products, though some schemes are more efficient, and different column sequencings are used to achieve different needs. For example, a zeotropic mixture ABC can be first separated into A and BC before separating BC to B and C. On the other hand, mixture ABC can be first separated into AB and C, and AB can lastly be separated into A and B. These two configurations are sharp-split configurations in which the intermediate boiling substance does not contaminate each separation step. On the other hand, the mixture ABC could first be separated into AB and BC, and lastly split into A, B, and C in the same column. This is a non-sharp split configuration in which the substance with the intermediate boiling point is present in different mixtures after a separation step. = Efficiency optimization = When designing distillation processes for separating zeotropic mixtures, the sequencing of distillation columns is vital to saving energy and costs. In addition, other methods can be used to lower the energy or equipment costs required to distill zeotropic mixtures. This includes combining distillation columns, using side columns, combining main columns with side columns, and re-using waste heat for the system. After combining distillation columns, the amount of energy used is only that of one separated column rather than both columns combined. In addition, using side columns saves energy by preventing different columns from carrying out the same separation of mixtures. Combining main and side columns saves equipment costs by reducing the number of heat exchangers in the system. Re-using waste heat requires the amount of heat and temperature levels of the waste to match that of the heat needed. Thus, using waste heat requires changing the pressure inside evaporators and condensers of the distillation system in order to control the temperatures needed. Controlling the temperature levels in a part of a system is possible with Pinch Technology. These energy-saving techniques have a wide application in industrial distillation of zeotropic mixtures: side columns have been used to refine crude oil, and combining main and side columns is increasingly used. = Examples of zeotropic mixtures = Examples of distillation for zeotropic mixtures can be found in industry. Refining crude oil is an example of multi- component distillation in industry that has been used for more than 75 years. Crude oil is separated into five components with main and side columns in a sharp split configuration. In addition, ethylene is separated from methane and ethane for industrial purposes using multi-component distillation. Separating aromatic substances requires extractive distillation, for example, distilling a zeotropic mixture of benzene, toluene, and p-xylene.  Refrigeration  Zeotropic mixtures that are used in refrigeration are assigned a number in the 400 series to help identify its component and their proportions as a part of nomenclature. Whereas for azeotropic mixtures they are assigned a number in the 500 series. According to ASHRAE, refrigerants names start with 'R' followed by a series of numbers‚Äî400 series if it is zeotropic or 500 if it is azeotropic‚Äîfollowed by uppercase letters that denote the composition. Research has proposed using zeotropic mixtures as substitutes to halogenated refrigerants due to the harmful effects that hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) have on the ozone layer and global warming. Researchers have focused on using new mixtures that have the same properties as past refrigerants to phase out harmful halogenated substances, in accordance to the Montreal Protocol and Kyoto Protocol. For example, researchers found that zeotropic mixture R-404A can replace R-12, a CFC, in household refrigerators. However, there are some technical difficulties for using zeotropic mixtures. This includes leakages, as well as the high temperature glide associated with substances of different boiling points, though the temperature glide can be matched to the temperature difference between the two refrigerants when exchanging heat to increase efficiency. Replacing pure refrigerants with mixtures calls for more research on the environmental impact as well as the flammability and safety of refrigerant mixtures.  Organic Rankine cycle  In the Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC), zeotropic mixtures are more thermally efficient than pure fluids. Due to their higher boiling points, zeotropic working fluids have higher net outputs of energy at the low temperatures of the Rankine Cycle than pure substances. Zeotropic working fluids condense across a range of temperatures, allowing external heat exchangers to recover the heat of condensation as a heat source for the Rankine Cycle. The changing temperature of the zeotropic working fluid can be matched to that of the fluid being heated or cooled to save waste heat because the mixture's evaporation process occurs at a temperature glide (see Pinch Analysis). R21/R245fa and R152a/R245fa are two examples of zeotropic working fluids that can absorb more heat than pure R245fa due to their increased boiling points. The power output increases with the proportion of R152a in R152a/R245fa. R21/R245fa uses less heat and energy than R245fa. Overall, zeotropic mixture R21/R245fa has better thermodynamic properties than pure R245fa and R152a/R245fa as a working fluid in the ORC.  Cleaning processes  Zeotropic mixtures can be used as solvents in cleaning processes in manufacturing. Cleaning processes that use zeotropic mixtures include cosolvent processes and bisolvent processes. = Cosolvent and bisolvent processes = In a cosolvent system, two miscible fluids with different boiling points are mixed to create a zeotropic mixture. The first fluid is a solvating agent that dissolves soil in the cleaning process. This fluid is an organic solvent with a low-boiling point and a flash point greater than the system's operating temperature. After the solvent mixes with the oil, the second fluid, a hydrofluoroether rinsing agent (HFE), rinses off the solvating agent. The solvating agent can be flammable because its mixture with the HFE is nonflammable. In bisolvent cleaning processes, the rinsing agent is separated from the solvating agent. This makes the solvating and rinsing agents more effective because they are not diluted. Cosolvent systems are used for heavy oils, waxes, greases and fingerprints, and can remove heavier soils than processes that use pure or azeotropic solvents. Cosolvent systems are flexible in that different proportions of substances in the zeotropic mixture can be used to satisfy different cleaning purposes. For example, increasing the proportion of solvating agent to rinsing agent in the mixture increases the solvency, and thus is used for removing heavier soils. The operating temperature of the system depends on the boiling point of the mixture, which in turn depends on the compositions of these agents in zeotropic mixture. Since zeotropic mixtures have different boiling points, the cleaning and rinse sump have different ratios of cleaning and solvating agents. The lower-boiling point solvating agent is not found in the rinse sump due to the large difference in boiling points between the agents. = Examples of zeotropic solvents = Mixtures containing HFC-43-10mee can replace CFC-113 and perfluorocarbon (PFC) as solvents in cleaning systems because HFC-43-10mee does not harm the ozone layer, unlike CFC-113 and PFC. Various mixtures of HFC-43-10mee are commercially available for a variety of cleaning purposes. Examples of zeotropic solvents in cleaning processes include: * Zeotropic mixtures of HFC-43-10mee and hexamethyldisiloxane can dissolve silicones and are highly compatible with polycarbonates and polyurethane. They can be used to remove silicone lubricant from medical devices. * Zeotropic mixtures of HFC-43-10mee and isopropanol can remove ions and water from materials without porous surfaces. This zeotropic mixture helps with absorption drying. * Zeotropic mixtures of HFC-43-10mee, fluorosurfactant, and antistatic additives are energy-effiicient and environmentally safe drying fluids that provide spot-free drying.

He is a powerful Mazoku (monster), who is both a help and a hindrance to protagonist Lina Inverse and her friends. Xellos is the single most powerful servant of Zelas Metallium, who in turn is one of the five retainers of Ruby Eye Shabranigdo, one of the Slayers series' deity-like beings. Because of this relationship, some consider Xellos Metallium to be his full name, but he calls himself simply \\"Xellos, the Mysterious Priest\\".Slayers novel 6: Vezendi's Shadow, Tokyopop's translation, pg. 230. Character Xellos behaves like a trickster, answering nearly all questions directed toward him with \\"Sore wa himitsu desu,\\" literally \\"That is a secret.\\" He enjoys the reactions that occur when he withholds information from others. For the majority of the second season, Xellos acts simply for comedy's sake, frequently breaking the fourth wall, all the while subtly advancing the plot. Generally, Xellos' mood can be determined by the state of his eyes: if they are closed, he is acting as the \\"Trickster Priest,\\" but when he opens them, he reveals his dark nature. Xellos' true intentions are a mystery. As a Mazoku, his main goal is to return the universe into the nothingness of the Sea of Chaos, but near the end of the third season he instead helps Lina Inverse and the others save the world. Even though he tends to manipulate Lina and the others, he has saved their lives on few occasions.Such as rescuing Martina Zoana Mel Navratilova from bandits for no apparent reason and saving Filia during their battle with Valgaav. His reasons for doing so are never revealed. Xellos is extremely loyal to Zelas Metallium and usually acts only if ordered to do so, although at times he has aided Lina's group without specific orders. Presumably, he would gladly follow any of her requests in order to keep her pleased, even if he himself is not pleased with them; for example, in Slayers TRY, he was ordered to offer to kill Lina Inverse if Valgaav joined the Mazoku side. In the novels, the Slayers group generally abhors his presence, while in the anime he is treated as a tolerable nuisance. In Slayers NEXT, the second season of the anime, Hellmaster Phibrizzo orders Xellos to follow Lina. While following Lina he occasionally helped but often hampered her quest to find the Claire Bible. During this time, he hides in guise of a travelling priest, though he is revealed to be a Monster in the later episodes of the series. In the climactic showdown with Gaav the demon dragon king, Xellos defends Lina and her friends from the attacks of Seigram and Gaav, while suffering a grievous wound in the process. In the third season, Slayers TRY, Valgaav tries to summon Dark Star to the world of Ruby Eye. Xellos is sent to prevent the summoning. He helps Lina and her friends fight Valgaav and stop Dark Star from being released into their world. In the fourth and fifth seasons, his goal is to ascertain whether Red Priest Rezo's soul is the only item sealed in the Hellmaster's Jar, or whether the piece of Shabranigdo killed in the first season was sealed with it. If so, he has to prevent the demon lord's shard from breaking free, due to the unforeseeable consequences such an irregular awakening might have. Unlike most dark lords, who create one general and one priest, Zelas Metallium created a priest/general combo ‚Äì Xellos. As the only Mazoku under Zelas' command, Xellos is extremely powerful. Lina's group is therefore cautious of his movements, because if he were to become their enemy, their defeat would be almost certain. This is confirmed in Slayers Revolution, when Xellos faces the entire Slayers party and comes out on top; during the fight Lina states that even with all of them fighting him at full force, they would still lose. He is immune to most magic; nothing short of a direct hit from Lina's Ragna Blade or Gourry's Sword of Light can stun him, assuming that his enemies are fast enough to strike him in the first place. Like all monsters, Xellos can teleport by phasing into and out of the Astral Side, the realm of spiritual existence in the Slayers world. He uses this ability to his advantage in battle, blinking between the Physical and Astral planes like a strobe light to make his movements more confusing. Xellos is capable of annihilating nearly anything using his own power (this is best shown by his destruction of an entire clan of Golden Dragons with a casual gesture). However, he tends to underestimate his opponents; he is, for example, severely beaten by Valgaav. In the anime, Xellos and Lina seem to have mutual respect for each other. He seems to enjoy the chaos that follows Lina and follows her for the sake of fun even when he is not ordered to do so, seeming somewhat fond of Lina, to the point of looking somewhat regretful when she was seemingly absorbed by the Lord of Nightmares. Lina also has comically beaten him when he gets them into trouble. In the novels, Xellos is more distant around her, somewhat troubled by the fact that Lina, unlike other humans he has dealt with, is able to see the bigger picture and is not easily manipulated. Zelgadis holds a powerful hatred towards the Mazoku because in the second episode of NEXT, Xellos destroys a Claire Bible manuscript, which the chimera thought might have contained the cure to his state. This does not bother Xellos, even though he is the only one who does not tease Zelgadis about his appearance. When Amelia makes one of her heroic speeches, Xellos often listens with amusement and mild curiosity, although they disturb him at times. When she expounds at length about how beautiful and wondrous the world and life are, Xellos becomes extremely weakened, even cringing at her minor comments. So great is the effect of these speeches on Xellos that, when they are forced to fight him, the group uses one of them as a weapon to render him helpless. Even though Xellos tries to be polite to Filia, she continues to insult him and call him names like \\"raw garbage\\" (namagomi). Xellos likes to tease Filia because she is part of the dragon race. Her hatred towards him originates from the fact that he killed many dragons during the War of the Monsters' Fall 1000 years in the Slayers universe's past. By the end of the series, they learn to tolerate each other and are capable of having at least one conversation. Reception While Xellos started off as a single-arc character in the original novel series, his enormous popularity among readers (ranked first in at least one of the popularity polls, surpassing even the main character Lina Inverse)Slayers Special 13, Afterword, pg. 251‚Äì261. allowed him to be included in the last novel and in all anime seasons following his introduction. Xellos placed fourth in Anime Grand Prix 1997 awards in the category best male character. Akemi's Anime World described him as one of the best characters in Slayers while Tom Tonthat from The Escapist called him \\"a key addition to the Slayers NEXT cast as the manipulative force steering Lina and company\\" and singling out the interactions between him and Filia as \\"the freshest comedic gems\\" of Slayers TRY.

In 2004, a team of Berlin Press contributors, led by David Brown sent an open letter fax to the embassies of all 191 member states of the United Nations General Assembly, requesting they provide an official portrait of their nation's Head of State. Most obliged, and Official Portraits is thus a gallery of the received entries. The portraits vary greatly in quality, photography style, and size, but Brown says there is no noticeable correlation between the quality of the portrait and any variable of the country that provided it. Some countries did not provide a suitable portrait (for example, merely emailing a low-resolution JPEG), these are included in a small index in the back of the book. In Brown's letter he specifically asks the embassies for pictures of their \\"effective head of state... who actually runs the country.\\" In practice, a more formal term may be \\"head of government\\" and indeed, most of the portraits are of heads of government (Prime Ministers) and thus not heads of state per se. Some countries did not understand the request, apparently, and emailed portraits of figurehead or otherwise symbolic officials who cannot be said to \\"run the country\\" in any meaningful sense. These include: *St. Lucia - portrait submitted of Governor General Pearlette Louisy *Grenada - portrait submitted of Governor General Daniel Charles Williams *Greece - portrait submitted of President Kostis Stephanopoulos *Monaco - portrait submitted of Prince Rainier III It may also be interesting to political scientists to note the photographs submitted by countries whose exact office of heads of state or government are unclear: *North Korea - Kim Jong Il, described as \\"Chairman of the National Defense Commission\\" *Iran - President Mohammad Khatami (not Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei) *Libya - Muammar Gaddafi, described as \\"Leader of the Great Al Fatah Revolution\\" References External links Category:Photographic collections and books ","title":"Official Portraits"},{"id":"3904491","text":"Kingswood is a village in the Maidstone District of Kent, England and forms part of the civil parish of Broomfield and Kingswood.

Bruce Humberstone and starring Sonja Henie, John Payne, Glenn Miller, Milton Berle, and Lynn Bari. It features the Glenn Miller Orchestra as well as dancing by the Nicholas Brothers. It also features Dorothy Dandridge, performing \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\", which was nominated for an Oscar for Best Song, was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1996, and was awarded the first Gold Record for sales of 1.2 million. Plot Ted Scott (John Payne) is a band pianist whose publicity manager decides that, for good press, the band should adopt a foreign refugee. The band goes to Ellis Island to meet the girl and soon discovers that the refugee isn't a 10-year-old child, but a young woman, Karen Benson (Sonja Henie). The surprise comes right before the band is to travel to Sun Valley, Idaho, for a Christmas event. While on the ski slopes Ted soon falls for Karen's inventive schemes to win the heart of her new sponsor, much to the chagrin of his girlfriend, Vivian Dawn (Lynn Bari), a soloist with the band. Vivian promptly quits the band out of jealousy, and Karen stages an elaborate ice show as a substitute. Of particular note is the elaborate \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" sequence. The scene begins at a rehearsal with the Glenn Miller Orchestra practicing \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\" and includes two choruses of the song whistled and sung by Tex Beneke in a musical exchange with The Modernaires. As the Miller band concludes their feature the camera pans left to reveal a railway station set. The band continues with the production number and accompanies Dorothy Dandridge and the Nicholas Brothers in their song and dance routine. Sun Valley Serenade is the first of the only two movies featuring The Glenn Miller Orchestra (the other is 1942's Orchestra Wives). Besides \\"Chattanooga Choo Choo\\", other Glenn Miller tunes in the film are \\"Moonlight Serenade\\", \\"It Happened in Sun Valley\\", \\"I Know Why (And So Do You)\\", and \\"In the Mood\\". An instrumental version of \\"At Last\\" was recorded by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra as well as a version with vocals by John Payne and Pat Friday, but these recordings would remain unused and unissued. \\"At Last\\" can be heard in the movie in three scenes, however, in an orchestral performance by Glenn Miller and His Orchestra in the Lido Terrace night club after they perform \\"In the Mood\\", as part of the orchestral background score in a scene between John Payne and Lynn Bari, and in an orchestral version with vocalization but without lyrics a minute and twenty seconds in length during the closing skating sequence with Sonja Henie.Soundtracks for Sun Valley Serenade. IMDB. \\"At Last\\" would also appear in the 1942 follow-up movie Orchestra Wives performed by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra with vocals by Ray Eberle and Pat Friday. Los Angeles vocalist Pat Friday pre-recorded the vocal tracks that Lynn Bari lip synced in the film. Future Olympic gold medalist Gretchen Fraser was the skiing stand-in for Sonja Henie.

He is most famous for his adult animated films, such as Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle. Picha entry, Lambiek's Comiclopedia. Retrieved March 3, 2020. Biography Jean-Paul Walravens, quickly fascinated by drawing, studied at the Institute of Fine Arts Saint-Luc. In 1960, he contributed his work as a caricaturist and cartoonist for many newspapers and magazines around the world including National Lampoon and The New York Times. During this period, he adopted the pseudonym Picha. A passion for drawing led Picha to the world of comics. He is the author of several books, as Picha at Club Med (1971) or Persona non grata (1975). After this period, he went on to animation. In 1975, he co-directed the film Tarzoon: Shame of the Jungle, a raunchy parody of the Tarzan stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs. The film was a huge success in its home country France, but ran through troubles with the Edgar Rice Burroughs Estate when the estate sued the creators of the film for plagiarism. The estate lost the case when the creators stated that the film was a parody. However, when the film was released in the U.S., the estate demanded that the film title and main character \\"Tarzoon\\" be changed due to the film's nature degrading the Tarzan name. In 1979, the now R-rated film was released under the title Shame Of The Jungle, and was rewritten by Saturday Night Live writers Anne Beatts and Michael O'Donoghue and was dubbed by John Belushi, Johnny Weissmuller, Jr., Bill Murray, and several others. Despite these efforts, the film was a critical and financial flop. Picha's next film was the 1980 film The Missing Link. Though it wasn't as successful as Tarzoon, the film was entered into the 1980 Cannes Film Festival. Picha also adapted the film into a comic strip. In 1984, the film was released into the U.S. under the title B.C. Rock. Major changes to the film included newly written dialogue by the comedy duo The Funny Boys (Jim Vallely and Jonathan Schmock), recut footage, different voices, different instrumental score, the absence of the narrator (with the main character telling the story), and nearly all the songs written and performed by Leo Sayer have been replaced by songs by other artists (including Steel Breeze, Hall & Oates, and Rick Wakeman) in order to attract a wider audience. Unfortunately, the film was poorly promoted on video and faded into obscurity. However, this version manages to have a cult following to this day. Picha's future work would never be released in American theaters or any home video format. Picha's next film was 1987's The Big Bang. After the small success of the film, Picha left the movie industry to concentrate on writing for television. Picha's television works included Zoo Olympics (1990‚Äì1991), Zoo Cup (1992‚Äì1993), and Buddy Buddy... A Dog's life (1995). In 2007, Picha made a comeback with Snow White: The Sequel, a parody of fairy tales, which most animated films were doing at the time.

They are commonly depicted wearing black horned hoods with white outlines of faces painted on them, a distinction that evolved during the rapid proliferation of the group into neighboring counties from its Taney County origins. The group got its name from the grassy bald knob summits of the nearby Ozark Mountains. The hill where they first met, Snapp's Bald, is located just north of Kirbyville, Missouri. An article in the October 5, 1898 issue of Springfield, Missouri's The Leader-Democrat states: The Bald Knobbers, who for the most part had sided with the Union in the American Civil War, were opposed by the Anti-Bald Knobbers, who for the most part had sided with the Confederates. Hernando summarizes their political role: Background During the Civil War, Missouri as a border state was hard hit by neighbor against neighbor bushwhacker fighting. After the war the neighbor versus neighbor fighting continued throughout the state with perhaps the most famous being the actions of the James-Younger Gang. Authorities had a difficult time bringing the criminal fighting under control because both sides still held strong partisan supporters. Between 1865 and 1885, Taney County reported there were 40 murders and not a single suspect was ever convicted.Missouri Legends ‚Äì The Fierce Missouri Bald Knobbers ‚Äì Legendsofamerica.com ‚Äì Retrieved November 7, 2007 The Bald Knobbers initially set out to put an end to the marauding gangs. But the Bald Knobbers were to end up having their own excesses and criminal activities. The Taney County chapter In 1883, thirteen men led by Nat N. Kinney formed the group, in retaliation against the hordes of invading marauders that had plagued the area since the start of the Reconstruction Era. The original thirteen were Nat Kinney, James A. DeLong, Alonzo S. Prather, Yell Everett, James B. Rice, T.W. Phillips, James R VanZandt, Pat F. Fickle, Galba E. Branson, J. J. Brown, Charles H. Groom, James K. Polk McHaffie, and possibly Ben Price. During the period of 1865-1882, over thirty murders were committed, none leading to a conviction. The group was called both the \\"Citizen's Committee\\" and \\"The Law and Order League\\" by its members.Mary Hartman, and Elmo Ingenthron, Bald Knobbers: Vigilantes on the Ozarks Frontier, p 30 However, because their secret meetings were held atop a \\"bald\\" mountaintop (in order to keep a lookout for spies), the public began to refer to them as the Bald Knobbers. As their numbers grew into the hundreds, out of a county of only 7,000 people, the original intent began to lose focus. Though initially praised for driving out the notorious outlaws, public sentiment soon turned against them. Although the men initially wore nothing more than a simple kerchief over their lower faces, if any disguise at all, many soon adopted a simple white muslin hood with corners tied off like ears, and cut out eye and mouth holes. This fearsome appearance only inflamed the anti- sentiment, peaking with the formation of the anti-Bald Knobbers. While the Bald Knobbers were made up of both Democrats and Republicans, though Nat Kinney himself was a Democrat and had ran for office as such, though he had fought for the Union Army, newer reports say that Kenney was a Republican, however this is false. The anti-Bald Knobbers were also from both sides of the political aisle. When the county courthouse burned down, both rival sides pointed fingers at each other, intensifying the bitterness between the groups. This loosely knit anti-Bald Knobber faction was best represented by the 19-year-old orphan Andy Coggburn. Coggburn hated Kinney, a very persuasive individual with a mysterious past, who had moved into the area with his family two years before the Bald Knobbers came into being. Coggburn took great pleasure in deriding Kinney, pulling pranks and speaking out against the vigilante gang. Kinney and his fellow Bald Knobbers held considerable pull in the county, and in no time Coggburn was shot and killed by Kinney in \\"self defense\\" outside the local church of Forsyth, where Kinney had gone to preach that night. In 1886, after gaining national notoriety from their exploits, and embarrassing state leaders, Missouri Governor John S. Marmaduke sent Adjutant General J.C. Jamison to Forsyth to investigate the situation.Darnell, Gerry. \\"Bald Knobbers: The Ozark Vigilantes\\", Bittersweet, Vol. 6 Num. 4 Summer 1979 Upon arrival, although the representative was pleased to see the atmosphere of order that prevailed, he recommended to Kinney that an official dissolution of the Bald Knobbers would be in the best interest of the county. That next day a formal dissolution ceremony was held in the town square where the Bald Knobbers were publicly disbanded, having served their original purpose. The Christian County chapter Neighboring counties such as Christian, Douglas, Greene, and Stone had already adopted the idea of masked night riders, and disregarded the strict rules that had governed the original Taney county chapter. The Christian County group became the most notorious by far. At the time Chadwick was the most bustling town of Christian County due to the nearby railroad, and a prime market for timber made into railroad ties. However, Chadwick's design as a \\"railroad town\\" meant that saloons and brothels dominated the area, and led many men to gamble, drink, and whore away their week's earnings. In a move towards moral straightening, the Christian County chapter was led by Dave Walker.http://www.findagrave.com/cgi- bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GSln;=Walker&GSfn;=David&GSbyrel;=all&GSdyrel;=all&GSst;=26&GScnty;=1418&GScntry;=4&GSob;=n&GRid;=23284590&df;=all& However, his seventeen-year-old son Billy Walker was a wild force within their group. Though it is rumored the Walkers had invited Nat Kinney from neighboring Taney County to help institute the Christian County chapter, it is doubtful this occurred since Kinney had recently disbanded the original group himself. There were also several differences between the groups. The Christian County group held meetings at a large cave on the edge of the Walker's land, and the members wore black hoods with cork or wooden horns protruding out of the top, decoratively designed with white or red stripes around the eyes, mouth, and horns, and sometimes with tassels dangling off the horn points. The members also routinely burned down saloons, and were generally more threatening than the Taney County group had been. William Edens was a young opponent of the group, and would publicly criticize them. After he received several warnings (including a late-night beating), tragedy struck. The night of March 11, 1887, the Christian County group met at the cave to discuss disbanding. However, that night new members were inducted, and several members were incensed by new remarks William Edens had made about the band. As the meeting finished, many of the younger men headed home the long way, towards the Edens' cabin. Captain David Walker pleaded with them not to go, but his son Billy and several others, including Wiley Mathews, were headstrong. When the men discovered that Edens was not home, they continued up the road to the cabin of James and Elizabeth Edens, William's parents. William Edens and his sick wife, Emma, were staying the night. So were James and Elizabeth's daughter Melvina who was sick with the measles, Melvina's husband, Charles Green and the Green children ages three years and three months. The Bald- Knobbers busted in the windows and splintered in the doors of the tiny cabin, spraying shotgun blasts as they intruded. In the gunshot exchange, William Edens and Charles Green were killed, James Edens seriously wounded from an axe blow to the head and Bald Knobbers William Walker and John Mathews shot. The wails of the women and children led neighbors to the scene of the massacre. First to arrive was Charles Green's father, George Green, who lived near enough to hear the shots. Though Dave Walker had attempted to prevent the men in his group from letting their actions escalate, his very presence in the nearby road at the time of the attack ultimately doomed him. After 80 men were indicted and tried in a series of worldwide-media covered trials over the course of the next 18 months, it was ultimately decided that four would hang for the crimes: Dave Walker, his young son Billy, Deacon John Mathews and his nephew Wiley Mathews. Wiley would later escape the county's new jail, leaving the three others to be punished for the reign of the vigilantes. As the Christian County men awaited their fate in jail, old rivalries ran rampant. A group of Anti-Bald Knobbers, still unsatisfied with the outsider Kinney's intrusion into their community, met together and selected an assassin for their cause. In August 1888, farmer Billy Miles entered a store where Kinney was inventorying for the courts, and killed the ex-Bald Knobber leader with three shots from his pistol. He then stepped outside and surrendered to the law, claiming self-defense. The event made worldwide news, and Billy Miles was given full exoneration in very little time. Back in Christian County, the execution date came to bear on May 10, 1889. After a late night of prayer services and repentance, the next morning the three men were led out into an enclosed area and onto a scaffolding the sheriff built himself, despite not having any prior hanging experience in executing prisoners. After last-minute prayers and final goodbyes between a father and son, the trap was sprung. Onlookers watched the three men twist and writhe on ropes that were too long. The condemned men's feet dragged along the ground, and at one point young Billy's rope broke, leaving him writhing on the ground and calling out for help. He was re-hanged, and after thirty-four minutes, the last of them finally died. Public criticism of the botched executions ran rampant. Taney County's loose Bald Knobber threads were being tied together at long last as well, as the law officially sought vengeance for Nat Kinney's untimely assassination. Sheriff Galba Branson enlisted the aide of an out-of-state bounty hunter named Ed Funk. Together they sought Billy Miles on the Fourth of July, 1889. After visiting several Independence Day celebrations, they finally found him at a spring with a group of men on the edge of the Kirbyville Picnic. They approached him with warning shots, and a gunfight broke out between the ex-Bald Knobber supporters, the Anti-Bald Knobber supporters, and the lawmen. Both Funk and Branson were killed, and Billy Miles and his brothers fled the area. Cultural impact Though the Kirbyville Shootout is seen as the general end to the story of the Bald Knobbers, there was at least one more quiet incident in 1890 involving an adulterer being lynched by a band of masked men, and here and there lie undocumented stories about unofficial retributions involving masked hoodlums in neighboring counties all the way up into the 1920s. Bald knobber stories made headlines across the country at the time, and again as the original Bald Knobbers passed away. As early as 1887 the Bald Knobber story was already being translated into popular culture as a play titled The Bald Knob Tragedy of Taney and Christian Counties.Matthew J. Hernando, The Bald Knobbers of Southwest Missouri, 1885-1889: A Study of Vigilante Justice in the Ozarks (PhD dissertation Louisiana Tech University, 2011) The start of Branson-area and Taney County tourism began with the 1907 publication of Harold Bell Wright's The Shepherd of the Hills, which features generic Bald Knobbers as the story's villains. Later, the Mabe family began a local country and western comedy revue called Baldknobbers (one word, and named solely for the humorous quality of the name rather than for any historical purpose); the Mabe family attraction started the music-show presence for which Branson has become famous. More recent Bald Knobber-related fare includes the indoor roller-coaster ride, Fire in the Hole, at the Silver Dollar City theme park; it is a ride through a Bald Knobber theme, but not specifically grounded in any historical events. Starting in 2000, the White River Valley Historical Society in Forsyth began producing a \\"Law Day\\" festival, featuring a Bald Knobber pageant focusing on the Taney County Bald Knobber history. And finally, a documentary produced about the vigilantes, featuring several reenactments, original locations, and descendants of either side, entitled Fire in the Mountain, premiered at several film festivals beginning in the spring of 2007 (winning the Gold Remi Award at Worldfest in Houston, TX), and had its television premiere on Jan. 13th, 2011, on the OPT Missouri PBS station as part of their Ozarks Reflections series. A feature film version is also in the works. There are few books and merchandise relating to Bald Knobber history, but documentary producer/director Damon Blalack has heavily researched and collected many items relating to the group in his creation of Fire in the Mountain, and plans to help establish a stronger museum representation of the history in conjunction with the White River Valley Historical Society.

Recently many roads in Thamel have been declared vehicle free zones to avoid crowd and traffic havoc. There are many restaurants in Thamel that serve traditional and continental cuisine, although prices are significantly higher than in non-tourist areas. Thamel also acts as the pre-base camp for mountaineers. It boasts a wide range of mountaineering gear shops, foreign money exchange booths, mobile phone shops, along with the numerous travel agents and guest houses. Thamel probably is the best place to enjoy nightlife when you are in Kathmandu. Thamel is home to a wide range of the Nepalese population, and serves both entertainment and employment purposes for the locals around the area. On Wednesday, 28 September 2011, Thamel was declared a full Wi-Fi zone. It is the first Wi-Fi zone of Nepal. Thamel is the center of Kathmandu's nightlife. There are many restaurants and cafes, live music and other attractions frequented by both tourists and locals on Fridays and Saturdays.

Accessed 31 January 2006 Congress abolished the Project on June 30, 1939. The ‚ÄúBallad of Uncle Sam‚Äù had been performed 60 times. Producer Norman Corwin then had Robinson sing ‚ÄúBallad of Uncle Sam‚Äù for the CBS brass. CBS was impressed and hired Paul Robeson to perform the song. Corwin retitled the song ‚ÄúBallad for Americans.‚Äù Robeson and Robinson rehearsed for a week. On Sunday, November 5, 1939, on the 4:30 pm CBS radio show The Pursuit of Happiness, Robeson sang ‚ÄúBallad for Americans‚Äù (Time, November 20, 1939). Norman Corwin produced and directed, Mark Warnow conducted, Ralph Wilkinson did the orchestration (in Robeson's key), and Lyn Murray handled the chorus. Robeson subsequently began to perform the song, beginning with a repeat on CBS on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Robbins Music Corporation published the sheet music. Victor Records decided to record and release the song. Robinson recommended the American People‚Äôs Chorus for the recording and he re-rehearsed them in Robeson‚Äôs key. (Robinson had written the song to the key of E.) The song was recorded February 9, 1940 under the direction of Nathaniel Shilkret and issued as record album P-20. It was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1980. Time Magazine mentioned the album on the May 6, 1940, issue. On May 14, 1940, a full page ad for the records (a four-sided album on 78 rpm records) appeared in the New York Daily News. Each side of the album ended with the lyrics ‚ÄúYou know who I am.‚Äù By the end of 1940, the album had sold more than 40,000 copies. On July 6, 1940, Bing Crosby recorded the song for Decca Records and it was issued as a 4-disc set. MGM included the song as the finale of the 1942 movie 'Born to Sing' (choreographed by Busby Berkeley and sung by Douglas McPhail). Jules Bledsoe, James Melton and others also performed the song. Lawrence Tibbett performed it on NBC for the Ford Hour. The British premiere was in September 1943 with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hugo Weisgall. In the 1940 presidential campaign it was sung at both the Republican National Convention (by baritone Ray Middleton) and that of the Communist Party. Its popularity continued through the period of World War IIDreier & Flacks -- in autumn 1943, 200 African American soldiers performed the piece in a benefit concert at London's Royal Albert Hall\\"Ballad for Britons\\", Time, 11 October 1943 --. After the war, Robeson transferred from Victor to Columbia Records. Victor responded by withdrawing Robeson‚Äôs Ballad from their catalogue. In 1966, Vanguard Records released Robeson‚Äôs recording on a 33 rpm record. It has been periodically revived, notably during the United States Bicentennial (1976). There is also a well- known recording by Odetta, recorded at Carnegie Hall in 1960. Robeson's recording is currently available on CD. Invoking the American Revolution (it names several prominent revolutionary patriots and quotes the preamble of the Declaration of Independence), and the freeing of the slaves in the American Civil War (there is a brief lyrical and musical quotation of the spiritual \\"Go Down Moses\\"), as well as Lewis and Clark, the Klondike Gold Rush, and Susan B. Anthony, the piece draws an inclusive picture of America: \\"I'm just an Irish, Negro, Jewish, Italian, French and English, Spanish, Russian, Chinese, Polish, Scotch, Hungarian, Litwak, Swedish, Finnish, Canadian, Greek and Turk and Czech and double-check American -- I was baptized Baptist, Methodist, Congregationalist, Lutheran, Atheist, Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Jewish, Presbyterian, Seventh-day Adventist, Mormon, Quaker, Christian Scientist -- and lots more.\\" The lyrics periodically point at elite skepticism toward its inclusive American vision (\\"Nobody who was anybody believed it\\") before coming back to its refrain: :For I have always believed it, :And I believe it now, :And now you know who I am. :(Who are you?) :America! America! Many performers of the \\"Ballad\\" have made minor changes in the lyrics.

The Zooamata and Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates and whales) together form Scrotifera. Subsequent molecular studies have generally failed to support the proposal. In particular, two recent phylogenomic studies analysing alternative theories for mammalian interordinal relationships concluded that Zooamata and Pegasoferae are not natural groupings.

Types of muscle are striated muscle (such as skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle), obliquely striated muscle (found in some invertebrates), and smooth muscle. Various arrangements of myofilaments create different muscles. Striated muscle has transverse bands of filaments. In obliquely striated muscle, the filaments are staggered. Smooth muscle has irregular arrangements of filaments. Structure There are three different types of myofilaments: thick, thin, and elastic filaments. *Thick filaments consist primarily of the protein myosin. Each thick filament is approximately 15 nm in diameter, and each is made of several hundred molecules of myosin. A myosin molecule is shaped like a golf club, with a tail formed of two intertwined chains and a double globular head projecting from it at an angle. Half of the myosin heads angle to the left and half of them angle to the right, creating an area in the middle of the filament known as the bare zone. *Thin filaments, 7 nm in diameter, consist primarily of the protein actin, specifically fibrous (F) actin. Each F actin strand is composed of a string of subunits called globular (G) actin. Each G actin has an active site that can bind to the head of a myosin molecule. Each thin filament also has approximately 40 to 60 molecules of tropomyosin, the protein that blocks the active sites of the thin filaments when the muscle is relaxed. Each tropomyosin molecule has a smaller calcium-binding protein called troponin bound to it. All thin filaments are attached to the Z-line. *Elastic filaments, 1 nm in diameter, are made of titin, a large springy protein. They run through the core of each thick filament and anchor it to the Z-line, the end point of a sarcomere. Titin also stabilizes the thick filament, while centering it between the thin filaments. It also aids in preventing overstretching of the thick filament, recoiling like a spring whenever a muscle is stretched.http://connect.mheducation.com/connect/hmEBook.do?setTab=sectionTabs Function The protein complex composed of actin myosin, contractile proteins, is sometimes referred to as \\"actomyosin\\". In striated muscle, such as skeletal and cardiac muscle, the actin and myosin filaments each have a specific and constant length in the order of a few micrometers, far less than the length of the elongated muscle cell (up to several centimeters in the case of human skeletal muscle cellsAlberts, Bruce., et al., \\"The Cytoskeleton.\\" Molecular Biology of the Cell. 6th. New York: Garland Science, 2015. p. 918. Print.). The filaments are organized into repeated subunits along the length of the myofibril. These subunits are called sarcomeres. The contractile nature of this protein complex is based on the structure of the thick and thin filaments. The thick filament, myosin, has a double-headed structure, with the heads positioned at opposite ends of the molecule. During muscle contraction, the heads of the myosin filaments attach to oppositely oriented thin filaments, actin, and pull them past one another. The action of myosin attachment and actin movement results in sarcomere shortening. Muscle contraction consists of the simultaneous shortening of multiple sarcomeres.Alberts, Bruce., et al., \\"Muscle Contraction.\\" Essential Cell Biology. 3rd. New York: Garland Science, 2010. p. 599. Print. =Muscle fiber contraction= The axon terminal of a motor neuron releases the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to the muscle fiber membrane. This depolarizes the muscle fiber membrane, and the impulse travels to the muscle's sarcoplasmic reticulum via the transverse tubules. Calcium ions are then released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm and subsequently bind to troponin. Troponin and the associated tropomyosin undergo a conformational change after calcium binding and expose the myosin binding sites on actin, the thin filament. The filaments of actin and myosin then form linkages. After binding, myosin pulls actin filaments toward each other, or inward. Thus muscle contraction occurs, and the sarcomere shortens as this process takes place.Shier, David., et al., \\"Muscular System\\", Hole's Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology. 9th. McGraw Hill, 2006. p. 175. Print. =Muscle fiber relaxation= The enzyme acetylcholinesterase breaks down acetylcholine and this ceases muscle fiber stimulation. Active transport moves calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum of the muscle fiber. ATP causes the binding between actin and myosin filaments to break. Troponin and tropomyosin revert to their original conformation and thereby block binding sites on the actin filament. The muscle fiber relaxes and the entire sarcomere lengthens. The muscle fiber is now prepared for the next contraction.Shier, David., et al., \\"Muscular System\\", Hole's Essentials of Anatomy & Physiology. 9th. McGraw Hill, 2006. p. 175. Print. =Response to exercise= The changes that occur to the myofilament in response to exercise have long been a subject of interest to exercise physiologists and the athletes who depend on their research for the most advanced training techniques. Athletes across a spectrum of sporting events are particularly interested to know what type of training protocol will result in maximal force generation from a muscle or set of muscles, so much attention has been given to changes in the myofilament under bouts of chronic and acute forms of exercise. While the exact mechanism of myofilament alteration in response to exercise is still being studied in mammals, some interesting clues have been revealed in Thoroughbred race horses. Researchers studied the presence of mRNA in skeletal muscle of horses at three distinct times; immediately before training, immediately after training, and four hours after training. They reported statistically significant differences in mRNA for genes specific to production of actin. This study provides evidence of the mechanisms for both immediate and delayed myofilament response to exercise at the molecular level. More recently, myofilament protein changes have been studied in humans in response to resistance training. Again, researchers are not completely clear about the molecular mechanisms of change, and an alteration of fiber-type composition in the myofilament may not be the answer many athletes have long assumed. This study looked at the muscle specific tension in the quadriceps femoris and vastus lateralis of forty-two young men. Researchers report a 17% increase in specific muscle tension after a period of resistance training, despite a decrease in the presence of MyHC, myosin heavy- chain. This study concludes that there is no clear relationship between fiber- type composition and in vivo muscle tension, nor was there evidence of myofilament packing in the trained muscles. Research Other promising areas of research that may illumine the exact molecular nature of exercise-induced protein remodeling in muscle may be the study of related proteins involved with cell architecture, such as desmin and dystrophin. These proteins are thought to provide the cellular scaffolding necessary for the actin-myosin complex to undergo contraction. Research on desmin revealed that its presence increased greatly in a test group exposed to resistance training, while there was no evidence of desmin increase with endurance training. According to this study, there was no detectable increase in dystrophin in resistance or endurance training. It may be that exercise-induced myofilament alterations involve more than the contractile proteins actin & myosin. While the research on muscle fiber remodeling is on-going, there are generally accepted facts about the myofilament from the American College of Sports Medicine.Gore, Jessica. \\"Muscle Growth in Bodybuilders\\". http://Livestrong.com. June 2010. It is thought that an increase in muscle strength is due to an increase in muscle fiber size, not an increase in number of muscle fibers and myofilaments. However, there is some evidence of animal satellite cells differentiating into new muscle fibers and not merely providing a support function to muscle cells. The weakened contractile function of skeletal muscle is also linked to the state of the myofibrils. Recent studies suggest that these conditions are associated with altered single fiber performance due to decreased expression of myofilament proteins and/or changes in myosin-actin cross-bridge interactions. Furthermore, cellular and myofilament-level adaptations are related to diminished whole muscle and whole body performance.

It is in the historic Walker's Point district of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Dedication Saint Stephen Evangelical Lutheran Church was dedicated to Saint Stephen, the first martyr of Christianity and venerated saint of the Church. History St. Stephen's was originally established as a mission church called Die Evangelische- Lutherische St. Stephanus-Gemeinde in 1853. It was organized by members of Trinity Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Lutheran Church‚ÄìMissouri Synod to serve parishioners located south of the Menomonee River, and quartered in an old abandoned school building near 3rd and National Avenue. The congregation officially founded in 1854 and was composed mostly of German immigrants. In 1857, the congregation moved to 5th and Mineral Street, where a church was built for $2,200 plus $650 for land. An accompanying school building was erected in 1865. Due to an increase in membership a larger building was soon needed. The old frame church was sold to St. Stanislaus Catholic Church for $4,500 and moved to a new location. A lot on the corner of 5th and Scott Street was purchased for $1,900 and a new church built in 1866 for $20,000. A tower was later added in 1879, containing a four faced clock installed by E. Howard & Co. of Boston, Massachusetts. With the need for extensive repairs looming by 1901, it was decided to raze the building while incorporating the tower into a new structure. Architect Otto Uehling drew up plans for the present church building which cost $43,000 to construct. It is of gothic design and built using red brick trimmed with limestone. The tower was also resurfaced in these materials. In July 1902 the first organ was dedicated. The present organ, a 3-manual Wangerin organ with 2,100 pipes, was installed in 1941. After more than a year of renovation and the installation of a new console, the organ was re-dedicated in 2004 as part of the celebration of the 150th Anniversary of the congregation. An influx of Mexican immigrants to the area began in the 1930s, during a labor shortage experienced by many of the local tanneries. This, along with the German-American population following the urban sprawl of the 1950s, helped the area to become predominantly Hispanic. In 1964 St. Stephen's was designated a Spanish Mission Church and began offering services in Spanish. Services in English had been introduced in the 1920s.

The earliest extant Italianate‚ÄìVictorian style structures date from the 1870s, and the earliest bathhouse dates from 1890. Other early structures are a Buddhist shrine from 1939 and a Japanese garden teahouse from that same year. The property is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.NRIS Reference No. 95000996 The hot spring's temperature ranges from 99¬∞ to 111 ¬∞F (37¬∞ to 44 ¬∞C). These springs are the site of occurrence of certain extremophile micro-organisms, that are capable of surviving in extremely hot environments.C.Michael Hogan. 2010. Extremophile. eds. E.Monosson and C.Cleveland. Encyclopedia of Earth. National Council for Science and the Environment, Washington DC  Setting and early history  The site is in a mixed oak forest sloping above Coyote Creek approximately ten miles northeast of Gilroy. The locale is associated with the discoveries of Francisco Cantua, while the core landholding of was purchased in 1866 by early settlers George W. Roop and William F. Olden. Roop could accommodate up to 200 guests per day, and the resort Roop developed achieved rapid fame. In those early times the resort was praised as \\"the finest springs in the state\\" (Coffin, 1873). A three-story wood frame hotel from 1874 and a single-story wood frame clubhouse also dating from the 1870s existed. In the last decade of the 19th century, further development took place: The 1890 bathhouse noted above, several 1890s board and batten guest cabins and a wooden kiosk above one of the hot springs. Notable guests to this historic destination hotel in the Victorian period included San Francisco Mayor James Phelan, gold mining magnate Adolph Sutro, Claus Spreckels and singer Margaret Alverson Blake.  The roaring 1920s  Further development took place in this vibrant period in American history. Immediately before the Roaring twenties a redwood water tank was built in 1913 and the first concrete pool for mineral water was installed at this site in 1917. In the early 1920s William and Emily McDonald purchased the property from Roop. More guest cabins were added, bringing the total to 24. The guest cabin Arizona was erected in 1924, but unfortunately it was consumed by fire in 1992. A number of the original guest cabins from the 1920s are still extant, each named after a different state. The cabin names are clearly affixed to the front of each structure for easy identification. Social activity at Gilroy Hot Springs was intense in this period. Bootleg liquor and slot machines drew large crowds for birthday parties, Thursday night poker games, swimming parties, Saturday night dances and local service club socials. Over 500 registrants per day would visit the resort in the peak summer season. The San Francisco Motorcycle Club had an especially notable outing here in 1920 (Gilroy Advocate, 1920). Automobile use was rising dramatically in this era, so that a frenzy of tree cutting occurred in the early 1920s all along Gilroy Hot Springs Road to accommodate the burgeoning auto arrivals. Yet at the end of the decade, the Great Depression caused resort activity to dwindle. Accelerants to the decline were the death of William McDonald and foreclosure by Roop. By 1934, the Gilroy Hot Springs Post Office was closed, and in 1935, the Southern Pacific Railroad ended its auto stage service to the resort.  Beginning of Japanese influence  On September 15, 1938, \\"Japanese Capitalist Buys Famed Gilroy Hot Springs Resort\\" read the headline in the Gilroy Advocate. Kyuzaburo Sakata, a successful local Japanese lettuce grower in Watsonville, announced he would build a Japanese garden to be designed by Nagao Sakurai, of the Imperial Palace, who was involved in the Japanese exhibit at the 1939 Golden Gate Exposition at Treasure Island in San Francisco. Gilroy Hot Springs was a microcosm of the successful struggle of Japanese Americans to attain full ownership in the American Dream. Unlike other cultures of immigrants who, encountering discrimination, withdrew into enclaves, Japanese settlers fought within the system to obtain a stake. Gilroy Hot Springs became a powerful symbol to Americans of Japanese ancestry, especially because the hot springs recalled similar physiographic features of their native land (Seido, 1941).  World War II and aftermath  After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Sakata and the considerable Japanese American population of Santa Clara County were imprisoned in Internment Camps. Caucasian business partners of Sakata carried on the resort operations during the war at a lessened state of grandeur. After release from the Internment Camp, Sakata returned to be an owner and manager of the resort. He invited his fellow Japanese Americans to join him \\"in the blessing nature created in Hot Springs in our search for the power of healing\\". It served as a gathering place where Americans of Japanese ancestry intermingled and relaxed with their European American counterparts.  Modern era  The sleeping annex was demolished in 1946, and in 1964 Sakata could not afford to meet the requirements of county building inspectors regarding new code for cabin heating systems. Thus, he sold the property to Philip S. Grimes, a landscape architect from Portola Valley. The hotel and clubhouse burned down in 1980. The property was operated as a private resort until 1988, when it was purchased by Fukuyama International, Inc., headquartered in Osaka, Japan. Fukuyama then launched plans for rehabilitation of the property as a Japanese American cultural and recreation center and secured its standing as a California Historical Landmark. In 2003, the property was purchased by the California Department of Parks and Recreation and added to the Henry W. Coe State Park. Although it is currently closed to the public until a management plan is implemented, many of the structures have fallen victim to vandalism and the ravages of time and weather.

Donaldson (1944-2006) was a mathematician and well-known cryonics advocate. He was born in the state of Kentucky in the United States, and took his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1969. He also lived in Sunnyvale, California, and for many years in Canberra, Australia, where he taught mathematics at Australian National University. He founded both the Cryonics Association of Australia and the Institute for Neural Cryobiology, which has funded ground-breaking research in cryopreservation of brain tissue. In 1976 Donaldson published A Brief Scientific Introduction to Cryonics,http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/DonaldsonBrief.html the first concise review of scientific literature supporting the practice of cryonics. He was a regular contributor to Cryonics magazine, the newsletter of the Alcor Life Extension Foundation, for many years. He also published his own periodical, Periastron, which discussed neuroscience issues as they pertain to cryonics. Donaldson proposed some of the earliest ideas for cell repair technologies, seeing such technologies as extensions of natural biology, but using new enzymes and solvents other than water for low temperature operation. When Eric Drexler‚Äôs ideas about molecular nanotechnology came to dominate cryonics thinking in the mid-1980s, he frequently expressed concern that too much reliance was being placed on the new molecular-mechanical repair paradigm to the exclusion of earlier biological approaches. Donaldson‚Äôs seminal exposition of his vision of future medicine was his 1988 essay, 24th Century Medicine.http://www.alcor.org/Library/html/24thcenturymedicine.html The views expressed by Donaldson on the subject of death were far reaching even by cryonics standards . According to Donaldson, as long as the brain continues to exist in some kind of repairable form, ‚Äúdeath‚Äù was merely a label indicating that the memory and personality information within it were beyond reach of current technology. While all cryonics proponents would agree with that where today‚Äôs technology is concerned, Donaldson went further. Instead of expecting a plateau of ‚Äúmature nanotechnology‚Äù to someday clearly answer whether cryopreserved patients are information theoretically dead, he suggested that increasingly sophisticated methods for decrypting the original information content of injured brains would always keep coming. He wrote of ‚Äúneural archaeology‚Äù as an important part of future medicine. He said cryonics in some form would always be necessary because whether certain brain injuries were ultimately repairable would always remain an open question for the future. Donaldson also maintained an avid interest in biomedical gerontology, self- publishing the book \\"A Guide to Anti-aging Drugs\\" in 1994. Despite this interest, he was pessimistic about near-term prospects for extension of human lifespan. In 1986 he stated that only small children might live long enough to see advances allowing them to avoid the need for cryonics. In late 2005, he wrote in Cryonics magazine, \\"We aim, by cryopreservation, to reach a time when aging can be reversed and abolished. Cryopreservation may well turn out to be the only way that anyone (now living) has any chance of doing that.\\" In 1988, Donaldson was diagnosed with grade II astrocytoma, a type of malignant brain tumor. Despite radiation therapy, his long-term prognosis was poor. In 1990 he received international attention when he unsuccessfully sued the Attorney General of the State of California for the right to an elective cryopreservation to prevent the tumor from destroying his brain . An episode of the television drama L.A. Law was based on his story. Although he was criticized for wanting to sacrifice life today for uncertain life in the future, the intent of his lawsuit was to obtain the right to cryopreservation should his tumor begin regrowing, not a desire for immediate cryopreservation. In early 2006, his friend Steve Bridge posted a message to the Cryonet email list indicating that Donaldson‚Äôs cancer had returned, and that he was returning from Australia to the United States in serious condition. He is cryopreserved at the Alcor Life Extension Foundation; his biography matches the description of patient A-1097, described in the Spring 2006 issue Cryonics Magazine, who received an unusually smooth cryopreservation on January 19, 2006.

The other books in the series are: Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday, Superior Saturday and Lord Sunday. Mister Monday is afflicted with the deadly sin of Sloth. Plot summary On Earth, a boy named Arthur Penhaligon (the main character) is at a new school. He collapses during an outdoor cross country run during gym because of his severe asthma. Two of his schoolmates, Ed and Leaf, stop to help him use his inhaler before running to get help. While waiting for help, Arthur notices two strange-looking men materialising out of thin air. They discuss a key and whether or not to give it to Arthur. One of the men, Monday, doesn't want to give it up because he needs the key in order to continue his reign, but the other man, Sneezer, convinces him to as the Will states Monday must give the key to a suitable heir but after Arthur dies, Monday will once again regain control of the Key. Persuaded, Monday agrees to relinquish control of the key, which is shaped like the minute hand of an old clock, although he quickly becomes suspicious of Sneezer, who apparently never showed much intelligence before. Sneezer and Mister Monday then fight and disappear in a flash of light. In their place is a slim book which Arthur puts in his pocket. In his hand, he holds the key which Arthur finds helps him breathe. As his teacher and school nurse approach, Arthur hides the key and passes out. Arthur wakes up in a hospital bed, tired. Ed and Leaf, the brother and sister who helped him, come and visit. Leaf comments that she had seen an old man pushing a bath-chair with a young man in it; obviously Sneezer and Mister Monday. Ed, however, had not seen Monday and Sneezer, but claims to have seen a bunch of men with dog-like faces digging up the field. Arthur asks them if anyone had seen the key he buried in the field and they say no, but promise to visit him soon. Shortly afterward, they have to leave so Arthur can take a shot. In pain, Arthur pushes his hand under the pillow, only to have his fingers touch the key, which has appeared there magically. A week later, Arthur returns home but Ed and Leaf have not kept their promise to visit him. When he gets there, he uses the key to open the book, which is called The Compleat Atlas of the House and Immediate Environs, and learns that the House (a giant, polyglot-fashioned building that he passed when going home) has an entrance called Monday's Postern. That night, he is visited by one of the dog-like \\"Fetchers\\" mentioned by Leaf earlier. He is saved by his ceramic Komodo dragon in which he had placed the Key. During the next day at school, he finds himself being pursued by the Fetchers again. Before being excused from gym class, a friend of Leaf's hands him a printed out email which explains her and her brother's absence. Apparently, they have caught some sort of virus and have been placed in quarantine. Leaf notes that she can smell the same stench from the Fetchers on those in her family but no one else can smell it. Arthur seeks sanctuary in the school library to figure out the Atlas and hide from the Fetchers. During this brief time, he reads up on the Fetchers and finds out that they are vulnerable to salt. His research is interrupted when Monday's Noon, a servant of Mister Monday who proves to be more powerful than the Fetchers, shows up. He attempts to attack Arthur and inadvertently starts a fire in the library. However, Monday's Noon can only attack him between the hours of noon and one o'clock and Arthur manages to evade him until then and Noon disappears. Unfortunately, Arthur still has to contend with the Fetchers who have managed to steal away his Atlas during his struggle with Monday's Noon. He escapes to the kitchens and finds salt to destroy them. During this time, the fire department and the bio-containment and quarantine team, who believe the new virus that Ed and Leaf's family are suffering from has originated from the school, arrive. Arthur realises that the Fetchers must have caused the disease and notices that the smoke from the burning library is spelling out a message for him to get to the House. Arthur lets go of the key to induce his asthma which causes a paramedic to take him to the hospital. As they get closer to his neighbourhood, an unknown force hits the ambulance in the form of a violent rainstorm. Arthur takes advantage of this distraction to leave the paramedic and get to the House. Using the Key, Arthur enters the House and finds that the House is a world unto itself, around which the Universe is organised, whose purpose is, or was, to observe and record all that occurs in the infinity. He sets off on a journey discovering that while there he is in perfect health during his travels through the House, he finds that he is the Rightful Heir, a person to whom the Will referred. If he fulfils this function, the Architect of the World's original intention will be enacted. To save the Lower House, he must kill Mister Monday and steal the other half of the key, of which is the Hour Hand, from him. He is accompanied during the most of his journey by a cockney girl-child named Suzy Turquoise Blue, who was brought to the House by the Piper (one of the immortal Denizens of the House) along with many other children. There, too, he learns something of the House's history: The Architect and the Old One came from nothing to create the universe. Unfortunately, the Architect's consort, the Old One, acts in the role of Prometheus, in that he had defied the Architect for some purpose of his own and been imprisoned as a result. After a while, the Architect left the House and handed over control to the Morrow days. Unfortunately, these Trustees have each been contaminated with one of seven deadly sins and have disobeyed the Architect's will to observe and record the happenings of the Secondary Realms (Our universe) in favour of interfering to where it suits them. Because of their inadequate rule, the House has become a dystopia. At the end of the book, Arthur defeats Mister Monday and takes control of the Hour Hand and gains the First of Seven Keys to the Kingdom. To the displeasure of the Will, he takes pity on Mister Monday and lets him go, after healing him mentally and physically. After going home, with the Will, he hands the responsibility of government over to the Will itself which manifests in the form of Dame Primus (a name almost literally meaning \\"First Lady\\" in Latin). He appoints Suzy as the second assistant to Noon who is actually Monday's Dusk who aided Arthur in his attempt to secure the key. Monday's former Noon is changed to the new Dusk while Monday's Dawn retains her position. Monday's Noon (AKA Monday's Dusk) gives Arthur a 'Nightsweeper' to get rid of the virus the dog faces brought with them. After waiting for ten hours, only to fall asleep and wake up at 11:56, Arthur puts the Nightsweeper (which looks like a toy horse) on his windowsill. It flies over his town, waking up everyone as it passes by. Arthur's family tells Arthur that his mother found a cure for the plague. Then a phone rings, which none of Arthur's family can hear. He realizes it is the phone Dame Primus gave him in case of emergencies. The book ends with Arthur looking at the clock and seeing it is one minute past twelve, Tuesday morning.

Gameplay  The game is played on a hinged board designed to sit atop the game box and represent Niagara Falls as a flap hanging over the box edge. The river is represented using clear plastic discs in a grooved surface, allowing board spaces to move downstream toward the waterfall. A game in progress Players collect gems along a river. Players move canoes to transport the gems, and can steal gems from other players' canoes. They may also influence the speed with which the board spaces move downstream. The first player to acquire four gems of one colour, or one of each of the five colours, or seven gems of any colour, is the winner. Although the game box states that gems closer to the waterfall are of higher value, the game treats all colours equally. Expansions =Diamond Joe= Given away at the Spiel 2005 game festival, Diamond Joe adds another canoe which is controlled indirectly by the players, and which participates in trades, generally bringing the harder-to-reach gems upstream. =Spirits of Niagara= Released in 2006, Spirits of Niagara adds double-capacity canoes, pieces for a sixth player, additional paddle cards with new actions, and a whirlpool which pushes canoes downstream. It also adds two \\"spirits\\" of the river: the \\"Bathing Beaver\\", which resets the flow of the river to normal, and the \\"Hurried Elk\\", which allows a player to move their canoe faster if they reach the gems on the edge of the waterfall. Awards In 2005 Niagara won the Spiel des Jahres and was one of the winners of the Mensa Mind Games competition.

It was written and directed by Matthew Parkhill. Plot Carmen, a young Spanish woman who is engaged to be married, has her hen night at a French restaurant in London. She is invited to participate in the observance of an old custom which allows her to kiss the stranger of her choice before the marriage, symbolically \\"kissing her single life goodbye\\" and bringing luck for the future. The man she chooses is Kit and both enjoy the kiss far more than they have intended. They fall in love, which creates a \\"love triangle\\" among Carmen, her fianc√© Barnaby, and Kit. What initially appears to be a typical urban love story begins to take some surprising and dark twists. In the third act, it is revealed that the circumstances have been arranged in order to create an \\"emotional snuff film\\". Unbeknownst to Carmen, she has been cast as the female lead in this endeavor. Barnaby has hired Kit to play a part in the deception, but has misled him by neglecting to mention that he himself, the director, will take on the role of Carmen's fianc√© (Kit believing that the couple know nothing of the film). Barnaby is apparently unscrupulous, as he actually marries Carmen for the sake of the film and later fakes a violent suicide (his motive being that Carmen will never love him as she does Kit). In a state of shock, she returns to Kit, who is also horrified, guilty, and never having met the husband, still in the dark as to the true identity of a man he knows only as \\"Ford\\". He admits to Carmen that he has been paid by a man to seduce her for a film, and that he regrets it immensely. Barnaby, whom Kit recognizes as his employer, suddenly appears, offering Kit his final pay and removing camera equipment he previously has concealed in the actor's bedsit without his knowledge. With contemptible satisfaction, he unravels his entire plan to the shocked, broken pair and bitterly ridicules them before leaving. Several months later, as the film is about to open, Barnaby appears to have won Carmen back. For a ceremony during which he is to accept a filmmakers' award, he engineers a publicity stunt by which it appears that Kit will have the ultimate revenge. However, Carmen takes advantage of the opportunity to do in her manipulative husband for real while framing his business partners for murder. Tragedy generates sensation and, while its clueless producers await trial, the film enjoys a big opening at which Carmen and Kit arrive in style, together.

From its earliest days in the African-Brazilian communities of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the genre has grown into a countrywide phenomena. Rappers, DJs, break dancers and graffiti artists are active across the complete spectrum of society blending Brazil's cultural heritage with American hip hop to form a contemporary musical fusion. History = Precursors = Many believe that even before the consolidation of the American hip hop scene, similar forms of rhythm and poetry were already manifesting in Brazil. The first form of poetic improvisation appeared in the northeast of the country (in the region of Teixeira, Para√≠ba) in the 19th century. Known as \\"repente\\" or \\"cantoria\\", it is a genre of Brazilian folk music practiced by a pair of singers known as repentistas who alternate themselves in the composition of improvised strophes following very strict patterns of metric, rhyme and thematic coherence. Also in 1964, the singer Jair Rodrigues released the song \\"Deixa Isso Pra L√°\\" (\\"Never Mind\\") which many consider to be the first rap song ever made in the country. = 1970s and 1980s = Brazilian hip hop has its origins in the Bailes Black (Black Parties) of the late 1970s where American funk and soul music was played.Brazilian Hip Hop History by Jaqueline Lima Santos at Hip Hop Archive.

These events, which tens of thousands of people attended regularly, had become an important forum for the expression of African-Brazilian identity during the absence of democracy; the military had assumed power in 1964 and would remain in power until 1985. The Bailes Black were orientated towards playing American imports by artists such as James Brown, Funkadelic and Parliament. The influence of \\"Say It Loud ‚Äì I'm Black and I'm Proud\\" by James Brown and the Civil Rights Movement is reflected in the names of the Brazilian Sound Teams (equivalent of the Jamaican Sound Systems): Black Power, Zimbabwe and Revolution of the Mind. The sound teams of the Bailes Black were soon providing opportunities for local master of ceremonies (MC) to take the stage and though the parties were still orientated towards American music they formed an important training ground for Brazilian rappers.Globalize This!?: A Place for Brazilian Rap in Afro-Beat - Afrobeat Journal Issue One.

Retrieved 16 May 2013 examines the concepts of \\"periferia\\" (periphery) and \\"marginalidade\\" (marginality) in relation to hip hop identity as well as hip hop's potential pedagogical value. Pardue proposes that the common perception of hip hop as a US cultural entertainment phenomena reflecting exclusive themes of urban gang membership and masculinity may be discarded for a more realistic assessment of its educational benefits especially with regards to the young people of the favelas. Pardue cites the expansion of CEUs (Unified Educational Centers) into favelas and the employment of hip hop educationalists as examples of educational models that build upon earlier social and communal actions initiated by those from rural Brazil that settled on the outskirts of major Brazilian cities. Pardue highlights that many hip hop artists and residents from the favelas have formed educational NGOs and have actively participated in state sponsored schemes designed not only to improve the lives of those who are economically marginalized but also with a view of promoting hip hop as a positive contribution to citizenship within wider society. Pardue points out that hip hop educationalists realize the importance of hip hop and its role in the lives of the young people of the favelas and that its pedagogical value serves to benefit not only those on the periphery but also the wider aims of state education.

Contents All six stories were original to the collection. Retrieved 2012-05-09. * \\"Turjan of Miir\\" * \\"Mazirian the Magician\\" * \\"T'sais\\" * \\"Liane the Wayfarer\\" * \\"Ulan Dhor\\" * \\"Guyal of Sfere\\" Setting The stories are all set in an undefined far future Earth, when the sun is nearing the end of its life. The sky ranges from pink to deep blue, lit by a dim red sun, and many strange plants and animals exist. Much of the story is set within the forested country of Ascolais, and in the ruined cities which cover the landscape. The setting is marked by the presence of unaccountable ancient ruins and other fragments of now-decayed civilizations. The human population is shrinking, and most live in the remaining structures built long ago, in varying degrees of ruin, squalor, or luxury. In addition, many people make use of technology or magic which was created long ago, but which they no longer understand. No distinction is ever made between technology created through science and that created by magic; the line between the two is blurred, and it is heavily implied that the two are ultimately indistinguishable. The characters in the stories are aware that they live on a \\"Dying Earth\\" and often make carefree, nihilistic references to the fact that their planet does not have much longer to live, assuming that the sun will soon burn itself out. It is never explained how long the Earth has left to live; it could be only decades, or possibly still thousands or millions of years. Many of the most important people in Ascolais are wizards. In the Dying Earth, wizards use magic primarily by memorizing lengthy formulas for spells, and then activating them by speaking the proper commands. Once cast, the spell formula is instantly forgotten, requiring the wizard to reread and re-memorize them. This novel concept for magic use was extremely influential, especially on other creators like Gary Gygax; it even formed the basis of the entire magic system in the game Dungeons & Dragons that Gygax created. Because even talented wizards can only memorize and \\"load\\" a handful of spells, wizards also have to rely on magical relics and their other skills or talents in protecting themselves. There are only one hundred spells which are still known to mankind, out of thousands which were discovered over the course of history. Pandelume implies that what the people of the Dying Earth call \\"magic\\" actually has a scientific origin; he indicates that many spells were invented through the use of mathematics and mundane sciences. Characters =Title characters= *Guyal: Guyal of Sfere is a young, wealthy man who is famous among his people for endlessly asking questions, due to a \\"void\\" in his mind which compels him to seek knowledge. Eventually, his father grants him magical boons to protect him, so that he can seek the fabled Museum of Man in order to ask questions of the legendary, all-knowing Curator. *Liane: A \\"bandit-troubadour\\", Liane the Wayfarer, as he calls himself, is a vain, venal, overconfident, and thoroughly psychotic adventurer. He travels about seeking wealth, wine, women, and song. In order to win the affections of a beautiful witch, he sets out to steal a tapestry from a mysterious entity called Chun the Unavoidable. *Mazirian: A greedy and heartless wizard, Mazirian will stop at nothing to obtain as much magical knowledge and power as possible. Although Mazirian, like Turjan, is capable of creating artificial life, his creations lack human intelligence. He imprisons Turjan in order to force him to give up his secrets. *Turjan: Turjan is a wizard who lives in the castle of Miir, where he keeps the books which contain the 100 spells which remain in human knowledge. At the beginning of the book, Turjan travels to an otherworldly realm to study under the wizard Pandelume, who can teach Turjan the secret of creating artificial life, as well as spells and sciences which are lost to human knowledge. Turjan's adventures often bring him into conflict with other wizards. *T'sais: T'sais is an artificial woman created by Pandelume. Unfortunately, something went wrong in the process of her creation. As a result, T'sais is literally incapable of being pleased with anything or anyone, and reacts with disgust to the sight, sound, etc. of everything she perceives. She is consumed with uncontrollable disgust and hatred for all living creatures, including herself, and spends her time attempting to hunt and kill everything in sight (except Pandelume). After an encounter with T'sain, she decides to attempt to control her instinctual hatred, and asks Pandelume to send her to Earth. There, she joins Etarr in an attempt to cure their respective ills. *Ulan Dhor: Ulan is the nephew of Prince Kandive, and a budding swordsman and wizard. He sets out to the city of Ampridatvir to recover a pair of ancient tablets supposed to provide access to ancient knowledge and magic. =Other characters= *Elai: Elai is a girl who shows kindness to Ulan Dhor when he journeys to Ampridatvir. She is a member of the grey-clad worshippers of Cazdal. Ulan informs her of the truth about the city, and she serves as his guide and companion. She is, however, unable to see anybody wearing green clothes. *Etarr: Etarr is a normal man who was unfortunate enough to fall in love with an evil witch. She used her magic powers to exchange his face with that of a demon, cursing him with an unspeakably horrible face. However, Etarr is a kind man. After he offers help and hospitality to T'sais, she joins him on a journey to force his ex-lover to return his face. Although Etarr is not spoken of as a magician, he knows some spells which he uses to protect himself and T'sais. *Kandive: Prince Kandive the Golden, as he is called, is a decadent and indolent monarch who rules the city of Kaiin. He is also a wizard of considerable power, from whom Mazirian stole the secrets of unnaturally long life. His age is unknown. Kandive finances the expeditions of his nephew, Ulan Dhor. *Pandelume: Pandelume is a mighty wizard who resides in the realm of Embelyon. Pandelume possesses knowledge of many things which are otherwise lost to mankind in Turjan's time, including the method of creating artificial life, of all the spells which have ever been invented, and of mundane sciences such as mathematics. However, he is not perfect or infallible; he created the flawed T'sais and needs Turjan to retrieve a magical relic for him in order to defeat an old foe. His personality is notably rational and reasonable for a wizard in the setting. Although he has a physical presence, Pandelume is never seen by the other characters; apparently, the sight of him causes insanity or death. *Shierl: Shierl is the daughter of the Castellan of the Saponids. When the Saponids force Guyal, as part of a three-part punishment for an act of desecration, to choose the most beautiful young woman in Saponce, he chooses Shierl, and inadvertently condemns her, along with himself, to be sacrificed to the demon Blikdak. Guyal and Shierl develop a relationship as the Saponids force him to escort her to the Museum of Man. *T'sain: T'sain is a beautiful artificial human woman created by Turjan. T'sain was created from the same \\"pattern\\" that Pandelume used to create T'sais, but T'sain does not share her mental flaws. T'sain returns with Turjan to the Dying Earth, and later attempts to rescue Turjan from Mazirian. Places *Ampridatvir: Ampridatvir is, like Kaiin, an ancient city whose people now dwell in its half-ruins. Although many of the buildings are crumbling, much of its ancient technology is still usable, such as moving walkways and anti-gravity elevators. The city was once a highly advanced civilization where all needs were met by technology and magic, ruled by the wizard Rogol Domedonfors. However, the city fell into decline because of the bickering between two cults, the worshippers of the god Pansiu and the worshippers of the god Cazdal. Before dying, Rogol created two tablets which, when combined, would provide the secrets of his power. He gave one tablet to the leader of each sect. :The people of Ampridatvir now live under a curse. The worshippers of Pansiu wear green, and cannot see any person wearing grey, while the worshippers of Cazdal wear grey, and cannot see anyone wearing green. As a result, the two sides are completely unaware of one another's existence. In accordance with tradition, glory-seekers dress themselves in red and attempt to retrieve the tablet of the opposing side. Little do they realize that this will make them visible to everyone, and doom them to being killed by invisible attackers. The people rationalize this by assuming that the red-wearers are killed by ghosts. *Ascolais: Ascolais is a forested country where Turjan, Mazirian, and many other wizards and strange creatures reside. Part of it is under the rule of Kandive. *Embelyon: Embelyon is a realm removed from the Dying Earth; it may be located in a different solar system or on another plane of existence entirely. It is the dwelling-place of Pandelume, who retains access to the many spells and arts which human civilization has lost. It is described as a fantastical landscape with many unearthly plants and animals, and a sky of shifting prismatic colours. *Kaiin: Kaiin is a city on the edge of Ascolais, ruled by Prince Kandive the Golden. The city is thousands of years old, and its people live in its habitable ruins. Despite this, the few remaining people are relatively well-educated and sophisticated, though Kandive derides them as a decadent people who are merely finding extravagant ways to occupy their time. *Saponce: Saponce is the city of the Saponids, a people who are ruled by ancient traditions. Their belief system is based on the premise that because the past was more glorious and civilized than the present, they must follow ancient traditions without ever questioning or knowing why. Their society is governed by extremely complex and rigid rules of decorum, and they impose ridiculously complicated (usually torturous and lethal) punishments on strangers who break their rules. Creatures of the Dying Earth *Chun the Unavoidable: Chun is a mysterious entity who lives in abandoned ruins north of Kaiin. His species is unknown. Chun kills and steals the eyes of anyone who attempts to steal from him, and pursues his foes relentlessly. *Deodands: Deodands are humanoids which look like handsome, muscular human men, but with \\"dead black lusterless skin and long slit eyes.\\" They are strong, murderous, and carnivorous creatures, but can be killed with offensive spells, which they fear. In Cugel's Saga, the wizard Follinense believes they are a mixture of basilisk, wolverine, and man. Deodands are notably eloquent. *Pelgranes: Pelgranes are humanoids with beaked heads and wings, who harass, kill and eat travelers. They are known, unlike the eloquent Deodands they are often contrasted with, for being gullible, brash, and unintelligent. *Gauns: Gauns are roughly humanoid creatures which haunt the streets of Ampridatvir by night, capturing and eating any human they can catch. They are large, slow, powerful, unintelligent creatures with pale skin, furry legs, fanged mouths, and arms as long as a man is tall. *Oasts: Oasts are creatures which appear to be very tall humans with blonde hair and blue eyes, but are actually no more intelligent than livestock, and are kept as such. Some tribes to the north of Ascolais use them as food, mounts, and beasts of burden. *Twk-Men: The Twk-Men are tiny greenish men who ride on dragonflies. They are useful sources of information, and are willing to sell their knowledge. By the same token, they can be bribed to lie to others. The usual form of payment is salt, which they crave for unexplained reasons. *Sandestins: Creatures comparable to jinn who, despite being extremely powerful, are easily compelled against their will to serve magicians. Sandestins allow mages to perform certain powerful spells without having to memorize syllables. They are fully aware they are superior to their masters in magic ability, which only adds to the resentment they feel.  Influence on Dungeons and Dragons  The Dying Earth was featured in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Advanced Player's Guide under Appendix N: Literature as one of the works that were read during the development of the game system. The designer, Gary Gygax, also credited the novel with being the inspiration for the magic system, which he called \\"Vancian\\".\\"The four cardinal types of magic are ... the relatively short spoken spell (as in Finnish mythology or as found in the superb fantasy of Jack Vance).... The basic assumption, then, was that D&D; magic worked on a 'Vancian' system and if used correctly would be a highly powerful and effective force.\\" References  External links Category:Dying Earth Category:Short story collections by Jack Vance Category:Fantasy short story collections Category:Picaresque novels Category:1950 short story collections Category:1950 science fiction novels ","title":"The Dying Earth"},{"id":"3904827","text":"The Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC; ) is the main convention centre in Putrajaya, Malaysia. This building is located on the top of Taman Puncak Selatan in Precinct 5. PICC receives a yearly average of more than 230,000 delegates and 15,000 visitors around the world since 2006.  History  Construction of the convention centre began in 2001 and finished in September 2003. The first conference held in PICC was the 10th Islamic Summit organised by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in October of the same year. In October 2004, the Putrajaya Convention Centre was officially renamed to the Putrajaya International Convention Centre or PICC. It is a precinct landmark, and was designed by Malaysia‚Äôs fourth Prime Minister, Tun Dr. Mahathir Bin Mohamad. The front of the building is engrafted with a thorough combination of ‚ÄòWau‚Äô, an ancient kite popular in the two Malaysian states of Terengganu and Kelantan and the ‚ÄòPending Perak', a silver royal like belt buckle, also seen in the main hall. PICC confines an area of 135,000 square meters, or approximately 1.3 million square feet. Besides hosting the 10th Islamic Summit, PICC is also a conference venue for high security risk events, hosted by the government or the private sector. PICC has had many important guests including foreign head of states and heads of government, important corporate personalities such as the world's richest man, Bill Gates, as well as the current CEO of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer. PICC can accommodate up to 10,000 people, with more than 57 halls and small rooms ready to be used.  Architecture  Close-up of the convention centre The design of the building is based on the shape of the eye of pending perak (a silver Malay royal belt buckle). However, the structure of the roof was designed similar to a folded origami to alleviate the plain roundness of the structure. From the front view, the building's eaves or wings are lifted at the sides, creating broad over hangings over the raking wall. Most of the walls are made of glass, so natural sunlight can easily illuminate the auditorium through the raked and shaded windows. The roof structure, which is geometrically complex, covers the plenary hall and the column-free banquet hall. The latter space can accommodate 3000 delegates, each with an uninterrupted view of the stage with the conference and main auditorium floors above supported on a sculptural system of radial arms. Surrounding these main spaces the ancillary accommodation follows a conical geometry with the rings increasing in diameter up the building to provide the larger area needed for the plenary hall itself. The main road leads to the convention centre over Seri Gemilang Bridge.  Interior  The Plenary Hall, designed for major conferences, allows a capacity of up to 3,000 people with a podium stage. The Heads of State Hall has a circular seating arrangement for 180 people. Perdana Hall has an extensive kitchen serving 3,000 diners seated at any one time and, 2 unity halls that can each be divided for seminars, exhibitions or banquets for 2000 people. All the halls are equipped with interpreter rooms with 13 different languages. On top of that PICC also has 14 suites for bilateral meetings on various levels, VIP Lounges, 10 halls for conference discussions where each hall can accommodate 200 participants, 33 meeting rooms for 10 to 100 persons, 3 public galleries, 2 restaurants, 3 prayer rooms and over 4 kiosks and a business centre for the delegates' convenience.

Several of these products use aliphatic polyamines to coat the surface of pipes. Helamin Helamin is a boiler feedwater treatment based on amines and polyamines. Helamin is a registered trademark of Helamin Technology Holding SA, Switzerland. Patents have been obtained for Helamin products, and in 2016, the following patents exist: EP1045045, JP4663046, HK1032080, BR9903614. Chemically, most of the Helamin types are stated by the manufacturer to be a \\"mixture of polyamines and polycarboxylates in aqueous solution\\", but some also utilize volatile amines, ammonia, polyelectrolytes, organic polymers, and scavengers of dissolved oxygen. In contrast to the conventional method of the water treatment, its action is based on a preventive protection of the surfaces. Helamin forms a film (i.e., is one of numerous available \\"filming amines\\"), which prevents corrosion and fouling on the water-side walls in steam boilers and piping systems, due to the affinity of Helamin to metal and oxide surfaces. Crystals which form in the presence of Helamine are isolated, so that they do not tend to group themselves. Thus deposit consolidation is inhibited. Already existing oxide surface deposits are gradually removed. In the boiler, a fine, liquid mud, which is easier to remove from the boiler walls, develops. Helamin does not significantly decompose even at high temperature and pressure employed in the modern sub-critical -water power- plant boilers. Helamin treatment can be successfully employed in steam generators, warm and hot water piping systems, superheaters, as well as cooling circuits to mitigate some of the difficult problems of the corrosion and fouling.
