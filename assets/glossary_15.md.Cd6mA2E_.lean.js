Retrieved 10 January 2107 Biography He was the second son of a Portuguese merchant, Rodrigo de Sequeira, and his wife, Violante Nunes Rosa. He graduated from Coimbra University as a bachelor of medicine in 1702. With his friend Dr Samuel Nunes and two uncles, he was arrested in 1703, tortured and convicted de vehemente of practising Judaism, at an auto da fé in Lisbon on 19 October 1704, which meant the death penalty if convicted again. His maternal grandfather's widow was burnt at the stake in Lisbon in 1706, as was his only sister Maria de Melo Rosa in 1709. He escaped to London with his mother, an uncle and five aunts, to join his elder half- brother, Abraham de Almeida (Gaspar de Almeida de Sequeira). He joined the London Spanish and Portuguese Synagogue in October 1709 and changed his name to Ishac de Sequeira Samuda. In March 1722, Samuda was admitted as a licentiate by the Royal College of Physicians. In February 1723, he translated a Portuguese report of a whale stranded in the Tagus, for the Royal Society, and was elected a fellow of the Royal Society on 27 June 1723, proposed by its secretary, James Jurin, and supported by Sir Hans Sloane. In April 1724, he delivered a paper to the society giving a detailed description by a Lisbon physician of the yellow fever epidemic in Portugal the previous year. He also provided six reports from Lisbon in Latin, by the astronomer João Baptista Carbone, which gave observations of the eclipses of the satellites of Jupiter made by Portuguese Jesuits in Paris, Lisbon, Rome and Peking. These were intended to be used to calculate longitudes. Samuda was known as a poet. In 1720, he contributed two poems in Portuguese to Daniel Lopes Laguna's Espejo fiel de la vida. In 1724, he wrote a poem of 1,274 stanzas in Portuguese ottava rima, arranged in thirteen cantos, titled \\"Viridiadas\\", after Viriatus, the leader of the Lusitanian people who resisted Roman expansion into Hispania in the first century BC. After Samuda's death, Jacob de Castro Sarmento added another fifty stanzas and presented the manuscript to King João V of Portugal. David Nieto (1654–1728) was the rabbi of the Bevis Marks Synagogue (the oldest synagogue in the United Kingdom) from 1701. Some of his attributes were immortalized by Samuda wrote an epitaph for his tomb,describing him as a \\"sublime theologian, a man of profound wisdom, remarkable physician, famous astronomer, sweet poet, fluent rhetorician, jocund author\\".Isaac de Sequeira Samuda, Sermam funebre pera as exequias dos trinta Dias do insigne, eminente e pio Haham e Doutor R.

Samuda supported his arguments by drawing on works of the Holy Scriptures and authors of classical Greece and Rome. He quoted Robert Boyle, Hermann Boerhaave, Willem 's Gravesande and Isaac Newton.

Biography Fuchikami was born in Kumamoto Prefecture and studied in Saga and Nagasaki. In 1922 Fuchikami organized Nihon Kōga Geijutsu Kyōkai (Japan Photographic Art Association, 日本光画芸術協会) and published the first issue of the photography magazine Hakuyō (白陽). He continued the publication of this magazine until 1926. In 1928 Fuchikami moved to Manchuria and was temporarily employed by the South Manchuria Railway Company (南満洲鉄道, 満鉄), and in 1933 became a chief editor of the Company's photography magazine Manshū Gurafu (満洲グラフ, \\"Pictorial Manchuria\\"). In 1932, with other photographers in Manchuria, Fuchikami organized Manshū Shashin Sakka Kyōkai (満洲写真作家協会, Manchuria Photographic Artists Association) and published Hikaru oka (光る丘, \\"Shining Hills\\") as its journal.Charrier, Philip \\"Fuchikami Hakuyō and the 'Manchukuo Pastoral' in 1930s Japanese Art Photography,\\" Japanese Studies, Volume 34, Number 2, pages 169–192, September 2014.Culver, Annika A., Glorify the Empire: Japanese Avant- Garde Propaganda in Manchukuo, Vancouver: UBC Press, 2013. Fuchikami's Manchuria-based works grew out of Japanese pictorialism and drew inspiration from French Barbizon School paintings and 20th Century pastoralist paintings and photographs. However, after the establishment of Manchukuo in 1932 they also reflected the influence of European 'New Photography' and Soviet Constructivist photography. The Soviet periodical USSR in Construction was an especially important source of inspiration for Fuchikami's depictions of mining and industrial installations in Manchukuo.Charrier, Philip \\"Fuchikami Hakuyō and the 'Manchukuo Pastoral' in 1930s Japanese Art Photography,\\" Japanese Studies, Volume 34, Number 2, pages 169–192, September 2014.Takeba Joe \\"'The Sun of a New Nation'--Ikyō no modanizumu, aruiwa mō hitotsu no riarizumu\\", in Takeba Joe and Miura Noriko, Ikyō no modanizumu--Fuchikami Hakuyō to Manshū Shashin Sakka Kyōkai, Nagoya: Nagoya-shi Bijutsukan and Mainichi Shimbun, 1994. In an article published in 2014 Philip Charrier argues that Fuchikami's depiction of Manchukuo as a timeless agricultural paradise was misleading in relation to the aggressive and disruptive industrialization and urbanization projects being carried out by the Japanese in northeast China. In the context of the times it functioned as propaganda in support of the Japanese colonial project in the region.Charrier, Philip, \\"Fuchikami Hakuyō and the 'Manchukuo Pastoral' in 1930s Japanese Art Photography\\" Japanese Studies, Volume 34, Number 2, pages 169-192, September 2014.

Vissarion Korkoliakos (; 1908–1991), was a Greek Orthodox monk of the Agathonos Monastery, close to Lamia, Central Greece. He became a monk in his teen years and was regarded by those who knew him as an especially good-hearted cleric with humanitarian spirit. The opening of Vissarion's tomb Vissarion (Bessarion) became famous after the opening of his tomb in March 2006, during which Monks and coroners found his body in pristine condition. The event caused sensation and amazement not only in the local prefecture of Phthiotida but also to the whole of Greece, especially after exposure of the event on Greek television. The relics of Vissarion were inspected for first time by the retired professor and famous Athens coroner Panayiotis Yamarelos, who spoke on television about an extraordinary and inexplicable event. More specifically, the phrases of Yamarelos about Vissarion's extremely well preserved body and his statement regarding the face being in such pristine condition that it \\"was ready to talk to you\\", caused a commotion. The Bishop of Phthiotida, Nikolaos, said that the Church should not be in a hurry to announce any kind of sanctity of the monk Vissarion, and that the issue should be discussed at the Holy Synod of the Church of Greece in Athens. However, after the publication of this extraordinary event by the Greek media, hundreds of believers from the area of Phthiotida and other parts of Greece, arrived at the Agathonos Monastery in order to venerate the body of Vissarion. Reaction The issue of the incorruptibility of Vissarion's remains caused a tumult within the scientific community in Greece. The coroner, Nikos Karakoukis, spoke about the possibility of a natural mummification because of the place in which Vissarion's body was buried. More specifically, as Karakoukis and other medical examiners said, the lack of oxygen in the place of burial, as well as the dry condition which existed in the tomb, could cause mummification of the body. The retired coroner, Panayiotis Yamarelos, proposed to Bishop Nikolaos that the body should remain in a feretory, in a specific place inside the monastery for another two or three years; in order to give a better idea to the medical examiners and Church depending on its preservation in pristine condition or its decomposition in the future. After the publication of photographs of Vissarion's relics in a daily Greek tabloid, the president of coroners Nikos Karakoukis asked from the Bishop of phthiotida to permit scientific research of a team of medical examiners on Monk's body in order to publish a conclusion for the case. Moreover, coroner Karakoukis denied the opinion of his colleague Panayiotis Yamarelos and spoke about a case which could have a logical explanation through the science of medical jurisprudence.

Herla often has been identified as Woden and in the writings of the twelfth-century writer Walter Map, he is portrayed as a legendary king of the Britons who became the leader of the Wild Hunt after a visit to the Otherworld, only to return some three hundred years later, after the Anglo- Saxon settlement of Britain. Map's tale occurs in two versions in his De nugis curialium. The first and longer account, found in section 1.12, provides far more detail; it tells of Herla's encounter with an otherworldly being, his journey to the latter's homeland, his transformation into the leader of the Hunt after his return to the human realm, and, finally, the disappearance of Herla and his band during the first year of the reign of Henry II of England (a synopsis of this longer version appears below). The second account, found in section 4.13, includes only the ending of the earlier version. Herla is not mentioned in the second account by name; instead, Map refers to the entire host as \\"the troop of Herlethingus\\" (familia Herlethingi). Origins and etymology King Herla is a modernisation of the Old English form Herla Cyning, a figure that usually is said to be Woden in his guise as leader of the Germanic Wild Hunt and thus the name is thought to be related to the French Harlequin (variant form of Herlequin, Hellequin), the leader of the Wild Hunt in Old French tradition. The same figure in Germanic paganism was described first by Tacitus in terms of the Harii who fought at night taking the appearance of an army of ghosts. The later Germanic tribe of the Heruli are also related to Herla. Also, King Herla possibly is related to the German Erlkönig (best known from Goethe's ballad Der Erlkönig).More words ancient and modern By Ernest Weekley Synopsis of the Walter Map story Herla, a king of the Britons, meets with an unnamed dwarven king with a great, red beard and goat's hooves, who is mounted on a goat. They make a pact: if the latter attends Herla's wedding, Herla will reciprocate precisely one year later. On the day of Herla's marriage, the dwarf king attends with a vast host, bringing gifts and provisions. The dwarf king's followers attend to the wedding guests so efficiently that Herla's own preparations are left untouched. The otherworldly king then reminds Herla of his promise, and departs. A year later, the dwarf king sends for Herla, who summons his companions and selects gifts to take to the dwarf king's wedding. The party enters an opening in a high cliff, passes through darkness, and then enters a realm seemingly lit by lamps. After the wedding ceremony, which lasted for three days in the dwarf king's realm, was over, Herla prepares to depart. The dwarf gives him hunting animals and other gifts; in particular, he presents Herla with a small bloodhound, advising him that no man should dismount his horse before the dog leaps down. After Herla and his band return to the human realm, they encounter an elderly shepherd, whom Herla asks for news of his queen. The old man, astonished, replies, \\"I can barely understand your speech, for I am a Saxon and you are a Briton.\\" The elderly shepherd described a legend of a very ancient queen of the Britons bearing the name mentioned, the wife of King Herla, who had disappeared with a dwarf king into that very cliff and was never seen again. The shepherd also added that currently the Saxons had been in possession of the kingdom for the last two hundred years, and had driven out the native Britons. Herla, who thought he had been away for just three days, is so amazed he barely could stay in the saddle. Some of his men jump down from their horses, only to crumble quickly into dust. Herla warns his remaining companions not to dismount until the dog alights, but the dog, Map says wryly, has not yet alighted, and Herla and his host have become eternal wanderers. Map notes, however, that some say Herla's band plunged into the River Wye during the first year of the reign of King Henry II (the year 1154), and has never been seen since. Moral and reasoning This folk tale is supposed to illustrate the trickery of the elder races, such as the dwarves. That, for ignorant men, their miniature kingdoms harboured dangers which could bring even a king to his knees. It also is an example of the widespread belief that time in the elfin realms passed more slowly than that on Earth. The story bears strong resemblances to the Welsh tale of Preiddeu Annwn or the \\"Spoils of the Otherworld\\" and the First Branch of the Mabinogi to which it may be connected, with Herla replaced by Pwyll. Herla in popular culture The legend of King Herla figures prominently in the historical fantasy novel, Mortal Love (2004), by Elizabeth Hand. Another interesting book is 'The True Annals of Fairyland in The Reign of King Herla' (ed. Ernest Rhys, illust. Charles Robinson). http://www.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/28103/C_Fairy_tales.pdf References=Sources * De Nugis Curiallium by Walter Map, Edited by F.

The exchange risk arises when there is a risk of an unfavourable change in exchange rate between the domestic currency and the denominated currency before the date when the transaction is completed. Foreign exchange risk also exists when the foreign subsidiary of a firm maintains financial statements in a currency other than the domestic currency of the consolidated entity. Investors and businesses exporting or importing goods and services, or making foreign investments, have an exchange-rate risk but can take steps to manage (i.e. reduce) the risk. History Many businesses were unconcerned with, and did not manage, foreign exchange risk under the international Bretton Woods system. It wasn't until the switch to floating exchange rates, following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, that firms became exposed to an increased risk from exchange rate fluctuations and began trading an increasing volume of financial derivatives in an effort to hedge their exposure. The currency crises of the 1990s and early 2000s, such as the Mexican peso crisis, Asian currency crisis, 1998 Russian financial crisis, and the Argentine peso crisis, led to substantial losses from foreign exchange and led firms to pay closer attention to their foreign exchange risk. Types of foreign exchange risk=Economic risk A firm has economic risk (also known as forecast risk) to the degree that its market value is influenced by unexpected exchange-rate fluctuations, which can severely affect the firm's market share with regard to its competitors, the firm's future cash flows, and ultimately the firm's value. Economic risk can affect the present value of future cash flows. An example of an economic risk would be a shift in exchange rates that influences the demand for a good sold in a foreign country. Another example of an economic risk is the possibility that macroeconomic conditions will influence an investment in a foreign country. Macroeconomic conditions include exchange rates, government regulations, and political stability. When financing an investment or a project, a company's operating costs, debt obligations, and the ability to predict economically unsustainable circumstances should be thoroughly calculated in order to produce adequate revenues in covering those economic risks. For instance, when an American company invests money in a manufacturing plant in Spain, the Spanish government might institute changes that negatively impact the American company's ability to operate the plant, such as changing laws or even seizing the plant, or to otherwise make it difficult for the American company to move its profits out of Spain. As a result, all possible risks that outweigh an investment's profits and outcomes need to be closely scrutinized and strategically planned before initiating the investment. Other examples of potential economic risk are steep market downturns, unexpected cost overruns, and low demand for goods. International investments are associated with significantly higher economic risk levels as compared to domestic investments. In international firms, economic risk heavily affects not only investors but also bondholders and shareholders, especially when dealing with the sale and purchase of foreign government bonds. However, economic risk can also create opportunities and profits for investors globally. When investing in foreign bonds, investors can profit from the fluctuation of the foreign-exchange markets and interest rates in different countries. Investors should always be aware of possible changes by the foreign regulatory authorities. Changing laws and regulations regarding sizes, types, timing, credit quality, and disclosures of bonds will immediately and directly affect investments in foreign countries. For example, if a central bank in a foreign country raises interest rates or the legislature increases taxes, the return on investment will be significantly impacted. As a result, economic risk can be reduced by utilizing various analytical and predictive tools that consider the diversification of time, exchange rates, and economic development in multiple countries, which offer different currencies, instruments, and industries. When making a comprehensive economic forecast, several risk factors should be noted. One of the most effective strategies is to develop a set of positive and negative risks that associate with the standard economic metrics of an investment. In a macroeconomic model, major risks include changes in GDP, exchange-rate fluctuations, and commodity-price and stock-market fluctuations. It is equally critical to identify the stability of the economic system. Before initiating an investment, a firm should consider the stability of the investing sector that influences the exchange-rate changes. For instance, a service sector is less likely to have inventory swings and exchange-rate changes as compared to a large consumer sector. Contingent risk A firm has contingent risk when bidding for foreign projects, negotiating other contracts, or handling direct foreign investments. Such a risk arises from the potential of a firm to suddenly face a transnational or economic foreign- exchange risk contingent on the outcome of some contract or negotiation. For example, a firm could be waiting for a project bid to be accepted by a foreign business or government that, if accepted, would result in an immediate receivable. While waiting, the firm faces a contingent risk from the uncertainty as to whether or not that receivable will accrue. Transaction risk Companies will often participate in a transaction involving more than one currency. In order to meet the legal and accounting standards of processing these transactions, companies have to translate foreign currencies involved into their domestic currency. A firm has transaction risk whenever it has contractual cash flows (receivables and payables) whose values are subject to unanticipated changes in exchange rates due to a contract being denominated in a foreign currency. To realize the domestic value of its foreign- denominated cash flows, the firm must exchange, or translate, the foreign currency for domestic. When firms negotiate contracts with set prices and delivery dates in the face of a volatile foreign exchange market, with rates constantly fluctuating between initiating a transaction and its settlement, or payment, those firms face the risk of significant loss. Businesses have the goal of making all monetary transactions profitable ones, and the currency markets must thus be carefully observed. Applying public accounting rules causes firms with transnational risks to be impacted by a process known as \\"re-measurement\\". The current value of contractual cash flows are remeasured on each balance sheet. Translation risk A firm's translation risk is the extent to which its financial reporting is affected by exchange-rate movements. As all firms generally must prepare consolidated financial statements for reporting purposes, the consolidation process for multinationals entails translating foreign assets and liabilities, or the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries, from foreign to domestic currency. While translation risk may not affect a firm's cash flows, it could have a significant impact on a firm's reported earnings and therefore its stock price. Translation risk deals with the risk to a company's equities, assets, liabilities, or income, any of which can change in value due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates when a portion is denominated in a foreign currency. A company doing business in a foreign country will eventually have to exchange its host country's currency back into their domestic currency. When exchange rates appreciate or depreciate, significant, difficult-to- predict changes in the value of the foreign currency can occur. For example, U.S. companies must translate Euro, Pound, Yen, etc., statements into U.S. dollars. A foreign subsidiary's income statement and balance sheet are the two financial statements that must be translated. A subsidiary doing business in the host country usually follows that country's prescribed translation method, which may vary, depending on the subsidiary's business operations. Subsidiaries can be characterized as either an integrated or a self-sustaining foreign entity. An integrated foreign entity operates as an extension of the parent company, with cash flows and business operations that are highly interrelated with those of the parent. A self-sustaining foreign entity operates in its local economic environment, independent of the parent company. Both integrated and self-sustaining foreign entities operate use functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates and in which day-to-day operations are transacted. Management must evaluate the nature of its foreign subsidiaries to determine the appropriate functional currency for each. There are three translation methods: current-rate method, temporal method, and U.S. translation procedures. Under the current-rate method, all financial statement line items are translated at the \\"current\\" exchange rate. Under the temporal method, specific assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates consistent with the timing of the item's creation. The U.S. translation procedures differentiate foreign subsidiaries by functional currency, not subsidiary characterization. If a firm translates by the temporal method, a zero net exposed position is called fiscal balance. The temporal method cannot be achieved by the current-rate method because total assets will have to be matched by an equal amount of debt, but the equity section of the balance sheet must be translated at historical exchange rates. Measuring risk If foreign-exchange markets are efficient—such that purchasing power parity, interest rate parity, and the international Fisher effect hold true—a firm or investor needn't concern itself with foreign exchange risk. A deviation from one or more of the three international parity conditions generally needs to occur for there to be a significant exposure to foreign-exchange risk. Financial risk is most commonly measured in terms of the variance or standard deviation of a quantity such as percentage returns or rates of change. In foreign exchange, a relevant factor would be the rate of change of the foreign currency spot exchange rate. A variance, or spread, in exchange rates indicates enhanced risk, whereas standard deviation represents exchange-rate risk by the amount exchange rates deviate, on average, from the mean exchange rate in a probabilistic distribution. A higher standard deviation would signal a greater currency risk. Because of its uniform treatment of deviations and for the automatically squaring of deviation values, economists have criticized the accuracy of standard deviation as a risk indicator. Alternatives such as average absolute deviation and semivariance have been advanced for measuring financial risk. Value at risk Practitioners have advanced, and regulators have accepted, a financial risk management technique called value at risk (VaR), which examines the tail end of a distribution of returns for changes in exchange rates, to highlight the outcomes with the worst returns. Banks in Europe have been authorized by the Bank for International Settlements to employ VaR models of their own design in establishing capital requirements for given levels of market risk. Using the VaR model helps risk managers determine the amount that could be lost on an investment portfolio over a certain period of time with a given probability of changes in exchange rates. Managing risk=Transaction hedging Firms with exposure to foreign- exchange risk may use a number of hedging strategies to reduce that risk. Transaction exposure can be reduced either with the use of money markets, foreign exchange derivatives—such as forward contracts, options, futures contracts, and swaps—or with operational techniques such as currency invoicing, leading and lagging of receipts and payments, and exposure netting. Each hedging strategy comes with its own benefits that may make it more suitable than another, based on the nature of the business and risks it may encounter. Forward and futures contracts serve similar purposes: they both allow transactions that take place in the future—for a specified price at a specified rate—that offset otherwise adverse exchange fluctuations. Forward contracts are more flexible, to an extent, because they can be customized to specific transactions, whereas futures come in standard amounts and are based on certain commodities or assets, such as other currencies. Because futures are only available for certain currencies and time periods, they cannot entirely mitigate risk, because there is always the chance that exchange rates will move in your favor. However, the standardization of futures can be a part of what makes them attractive to some: they are well-regulated and are traded only on exchanges. Two popular and inexpensive methods companies can use to minimize potential losses is hedging with options and forward contracts. If a company decides to purchase an option, it is able to set a rate that is \\"at- worst\\" for the transaction. If the option expires and it's out-of-the-money, the company is able to execute the transaction in the open market at a favorable rate. If a company decides to take out a forward contract, it will set a specific currency rate for a set date in the future. Currency invoicing refers to the practice of invoicing transactions in the currency that benefits the firm. It is important to note that this does not necessarily eliminate foreign exchange risk, but rather moves its burden from one party to another. A firm can invoice its imports from another country in its home currency, which would move the risk to the exporter and away from itself. This technique may not be as simple as it sounds; if the exporter's currency is more volatile than that of the importer, the firm would want to avoid invoicing in that currency. If both the importer and exporter want to avoid using their own currencies, it is also fairly common to conduct the exchange using a third, more stable currency. If a firm looks to leading and lagging as a hedge, it must exercise extreme caution. Leading and lagging refer to the movement of cash inflows or outflows either forward or backward in time. For example, if a firm must pay a large sum in three months but is also set to receive a similar amount from another order, it might move the date of receipt of the sum to coincide with the payment. This delay would be termed lagging. If the receipt date were moved sooner, this would be termed leading the payment. Another method to reduce exposure transaction risk is natural hedging (or netting foreign-exchange exposures), which is an efficient form of hedging because it will reduce the margin that is taken by banks when businesses exchange currencies; and it is a form of hedging that is easy to understand. To enforce the netting, there will be a systematic-approach requirement, as well as a real-time look at exposure and a platform for initiating the process, which, along with the foreign cash flow uncertainty, can make the procedure seem more difficult. Having a back-up plan, such as foreign-currency accounts, will be helpful in this process. The companies that deal with inflows and outflows in the same currency will experience efficiencies and a reduction in risk by calculating the net of the inflows and outflows, and using foreign-currency account balances that will pay in part for some or all of the exposure. Translation hedging Translation exposure is largely dependent on the translation methods required by accounting standards of the home country. For example, the United States Federal Accounting Standards Board specifies when and where to use certain methods. Firms can manage translation exposure by performing a balance sheet hedge, since translation exposure arises from discrepancies between net assets and net liabilities solely from exchange rate differences. Following this logic, a firm could acquire an appropriate amount of exposed assets or liabilities to balance any outstanding discrepancy. Foreign exchange derivatives may also be used to hedge against translation exposure. A common technique to hedge translation risk is called balance-sheet hedging, which involves speculating on the forward market in hopes that a cash profit will be realized to offset a non-cash loss from translation. This requires an equal amount of exposed foreign currency assets and liabilities on the firm's consolidated balance sheet. If this is achieved for each foreign currency, the net translation exposure will be zero. A change in the exchange rates will change the value of exposed liabilities to an equal degree but opposite to the change in the value of exposed assets. Companies can also attempt to hedge translation risk by purchasing currency swaps or futures contracts. Companies can also request clients to pay in the company's domestic currency, whereby the risk is transferred to the client. Strategies other than financial hedging Firms may adopt strategies other than financial hedging for managing their economic or operating exposure, by carefully selecting production sites with a mind for lowering costs, using a policy of flexible sourcing in its supply chain management, diversifying its export market across a greater number of countries, or by implementing strong research and development activities and differentiating its products in pursuit of less foreign-exchange risk exposure. By putting more effort into researching alternative methods for production and development, it is possible that a firm may discover more ways to produce their outputs locally rather than relying on export sources that would expose them to the foreign exchange risk. By paying attention to currency fluctuations around the world, firms can advantageously relocate their production to other countries. For this strategy to be effective, the new site must have lower production costs. There are many factors a firm must consider before relocating, such as a foreign nation's political and economic stability.

The Biennial has been organised by the Istanbul Foundation for Culture and Arts (IKSV) since its inception. The Biennial aims to create a meeting point in Istanbul in the field of visual arts between artists from diverse cultures and the audience. The IKSV has enabled the formation of an international cultural network between local and international art circles, artists, curators and art critics by bringing together new trends in contemporary art every two years. Format Istanbul Biennial adheres to an exhibition model in which the curator, appointed by an international advisory board, develops a conceptual framework according to which a variety of artists and projects are invited to the exhibition. After the first two biennials realized under the general coordination of Beral Madra in 1987 and 1989, IKSV decided to commission a different curator for each edition, starting with the 1992 Istanbul Biennial directed by Vasif Kortun. The most comprehensive international art exhibition organized in Turkey and the wider region, Istanbul Biennial plays an important role as a local and regional platform for artists to reach an international audience, and for the local audiences to meet artists from around the World. The opportunity to follow developments and discussions in the art world through a complementary educational programme is provided both for students and viewers of art through the exhibitions and simultaneously translated panel discussions, conferences and workshops organized within the scope of the exhibitions. Istanbul’s 13th biennial in 2013 was overtaken by political events; its theme was art in public spaces but was forced to retreat indoors after many of the scheduled venues filling with plumes of tear gas and water cannon as police and demonstrators clashed had been tuned into a battleground between demonstrators trying to protect the city’s Gezi Park.Andrew Finkel (September 11, 2014), Istanbul Biennial curator reveals concept behind 'Saltwater' theme The Art Newspaper.

This fluid is composed of blood plasma that has seeped out of ruptured small blood vessels and the inflammatory fluid produced by injured and dying cells. Seromas are different from hematomas, which contain red blood cells, and abscesses, which contain pus and result from an infection. Serous fluid is also different from lymph. Early or improper removal of sutures can sometimes lead to formation of seroma or discharge of serous fluid from operative areas. Seromas can also sometimes be caused by injury, such as when the initial swelling from a blow or fall does not fully subside. The remaining serous fluid causes a seroma that the body usually absorbs gradually over time (often taking many days or weeks); however, a knot of calcified tissue sometimes remains. Seromas are particularly common after breast surgery (e.g., mastectomy), abdominal surgeries, and reconstructive surgery. They are a treatment target in partial-breast radiation therapy. The larger the surgical intervention, the more likely it is that seromas appear. Larger seromas take longer to resolve than small ones, and they are more likely to undergo secondary infection. A seroma may persist for several months or even years as the surrounding tissue hardens. On CT scans, seromas have a radiodensity of 0–20 Hounsfield units (HU), generally in the lower part of this range, consistent with clear fluid.Page 258 in: Treatment Seromas may be difficult to manage at times. Research suggests that the procedure of quilting (inserting interrupted deep stitches in the wound) after mastectomy significantly reduces seroma formation. The removal of seromas by fine-needle aspiration is controversial: it is recommended by some for the reason that seromas can be a culture medium for bacteria, whereas others advise it only for collection of excessive amounts of fluid, because even an aspiration carried out under aseptic conditions carries a certain risk of infection. Depending on the volume and duration of leakage, control of a leak may take up to a few weeks to resolve with aspiration of serums and the application of pressure dressings. Manual lymphatic drainage (MLD) conducted by a trained professional can also assist in managing and treating seromas. If a serum or leak does not resolve (e.g., after a soft tissue biopsy), it may be necessary to take the patient back to the operating room in order to place some form of closed-suction drain into the wound. This usually is not necessary and conservative management prevails.Schwartz's principles of surgery: self assessment and board review, 8th edition, chapter 11, patient safety, errors, and complications in surgery In case of lumpectomy, the formation of a seroma at the lumpectomy site has been cited in medical literature as being beneficial, with claims that it can contribute to preserve the contour of the breast. In some cases a seroma may need to be drained prior to a course of radiotherapy adjuvant to surgery. Prevention=Surgical Gentle surgical technique with careful and meticulous control of bleeding helps avoid seromas. Liposuction contributes to seroma formation when it is done in conjunction with creating a \\"flap\\" and potential space is confluent with the treated area. Controversy exists in tummy tuck surgery as to whether electrosurgical dissection either contributes to serum formation or prevents it. Drains are traditionally used but their use has been challenged by various authors who believe quilting sutures alone may be sufficient to reach results as good as or better than when using drains. Seromas accumulate in what is known as \\"dead space\\" where a potential place for the fluid exists. Efforts are directed at reducing or eliminating the dead space. Quilting sutures reduce the risk of the skin–fat layer's separating from the deeper muscle layer, and having the separation fill up with fluid, by physically holding those layers together. Drains suck the two layers together so the body's natural \\"glue\\" (fibrin) and wound healing have a chance for a permanent bond. Non-surgical Prevention of movement between the layers allows the tentative initial bond of fibrin to be reinforced by wound healing with a thin, strong, layer of scar. Avoiding certain positions for certain surgeries may have an effect. (In abdominoplasty, sitting upright with the knees bent and hips flexed will cause pressure across the lower abdomen and a tendency to seroma formation. The patient is best to stand or at least be semi-recumbent). External pressure may help in immobilization but also is thought to reduce the tendency of the fluid to leak out of vessels by increasing the back-pressure on those fluid sources. Following breast augmentation or double mastectomy, binding the chest may be recommended for several weeks to minimize the risk of seromas.

The 114 hectares of downs rise to over 700 ft where a plateau dominates the escarpment overlooking the town. The downs are a combination of gorse and grassland, wood and coppice. there were 88 registered commoners, some of whom with livestock grazing rights under the Commons Act 2006. Rights under the act include pasturage, estover and turbary. History alt= It originated in the ancient past from a parcel of manorial waste ground that belonged to the feudal manor of Bromyard. The common has changed hands many times. The medieval period was one of prosperity for the tanners and clothiers of Bromyard, in a part of England where there were more sheep than people. Livestock used to graze on the downs, where people with common rights could share the grass. During the agricultural revolution its ownership was shared by various aristocratic owners, including from nearby Buckenhill Manor, and Brockhampton Court. A feature on the common is the outline of an old disused horse racecourse that was created by soldiers and tenant farmers returning from the Napoleonic Wars. During World War One Bromyard had an internment camp, and many housed there were Sinn Fein-IRA. The Second World War brought preparative measures for any possible German invasion, allowing the Mercian Marquis to construct underground bunkers in the dense forest. Leisure The downs play host to a clutch of voluntary and community groups. There is a caravan club which occupies a field on the downs.Caravans The last remaining pub on the downs, The Royal Oak is a 'black and white' half-timbered house dating back at least 300 years.pub site NotesExternal links * Foundation for Common Land * Open Spaces Society protecting open spaces * Factsheet Category:Parks and open spaces in Herefordshire Category:Hamlets in Herefordshire ","title":"Bromyard Downs"},{"id":"4421840","text":"Harding University High School is located at 2001 Alleghany Street, in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Relationships with other rivers During the Early and Middle Pleistocene, central and southern Britain had two main rivers of more than : the Bytham and the Ancestral Thames. For most of the Early Pleistocene the Ancestral Thames was the main river with, at its maximum extent, a catchment area that extended into Wales alongside the Chiltern Hills, through southern East Anglia and finally into Doggerland (now the North Sea), where it joined the ancestral Rhine. In the early Ice Age the Thames took a line similar to the present-day River Thame, through parts of Bedfordshire, Hertfordshire and north-west Essex, then took a course resembling that of the River Waveney along the Suffolk/Norfolk border. Initially the more northerly Bytham River was a tributary of the Thames but as the climate warmed it progressively extended its catchment. During the Anglian Stage the Bytham river more or less disappeared and the Thames was diverted to its present course through London. Loubourg River system During the last glacial maximum, much of what is now the southern part of the North Sea was land, known to palaeogeographers as Doggerland. At this time, the Thames, the Meuse, the Scheldt and the Rhine probably joined before flowing into the sea, in a system known as the Loubourg or Lobourg River.Vaikmäe, R., Edmunds, W. M., and Manzano, M., (2001) \\"Weichselian palaeoclimate and palaeoenvironment in Europe: Background for palaeogroundwater formation\\", in \\"Palaeowaters in coastal Europe: Evolution of groundwater since the Late Pleistocene\\" (W. M. Edmunds and C. J. Milne (eds)). London:The Geological Society. p. 177 There is some debate as to whether this river would have flowed south-west into what is now the English Channel, or north into the North Sea close to modern Yorkshire. Current scientific research favours the former opinion, with the Thames and Rhine meeting in a large lake, the outflow of which was close to the present-day Straits of Dover.Bridgland, D. R., and D’Olier, B. (1995) \\"The Pleistocene evolution of the Thames and Rhine drainage systems in the southern North Sea Basin (abstract)\\", Geological Society, London, Special Publications, v. 96, p. 27-45, in Lyell Collection. Retrieved 12 November 2015. Vestiges Before its diversion, this river and its tributaries formed a river system draining the Welsh mountains and bringing some of their characteristic volcanic rocks into this area. The evidence for this is a substantial thickness of what is called Kesgrave Sands and Gravels which represent the bed of the river. These old Thames gravels contain a variety of distinctive pebbles from as far away as North Wales, evidence of the ancient drainage catchment. The gravels also contain large boulders of puddingstone and sarsens, which are very hard conglomerates and sandstones respectively. They are believed to be derived from pebble and sand seams in the Reading Beds (subsequently cemented by quartz). They have been put to use by man as ancient way markers at road junctions. The gravels have great commercial value and are worked in numerous pits between Harlow, Chelmsford and Colchester, where the ancestral Thames flowed at least 600,000 years ago. During this time the River Medway flowed north across east Essex to join the Thames near Clacton, leaving behind a ribbon of distinctive gravel which can be found between Burnham-on- Crouch and Bradwell-on-Sea. There were also other northward-flowing tributaries of the early Thames. Evidence of these are the patches of gravel that are found near the tops of the modest hills in south Essex, principally the Langdon Hills, Warley and High Beach in Epping Forest.

Maria was probably born in March 1152. In 1163 she was engaged to the future King Béla III of Hungary; Manuel, no longer expecting to father a legitimate son, was at that time ready to designate Béla (whom he had given the new court dignity of despotes and had renamed \\"Alexios\\") as his eventual successor. This engagement was broken off in 1169, soon after Manuel's son Alexios was born. Maria was then engaged to King William II of Sicily, but this engagement, too, was broken off by her father. Finally, in 1179, Maria was married to Renier of Montferrat, who was renamed \\"John\\" and given the title of Caesar. After the death of the Emperor Manuel in 1180, Maria and Renier became involved in intrigues against Maria's stepmother, Maria of Antioch, who was ruling as regent for her young son, now Emperor Alexios II. A riot broke out against the empress, encouraged by Maria and Renier, but their attempt to seize power failed. Both died soon afterwards, apparently by poison, soon after the seizure of the regency by Andronikos Komnenos, a paternal first cousin of Manuel. It seems that Maria never bore a child.

The company had been producing three lines; musical instrument series called GEM, various studio equipment series called LEM and amplifier products called ELKA. First production Generalmusic's first successful arranger workstation models were their WX series, which offered a large blue LCD display, a user-friendly interface and some vintage synth sound presets like Oberheim, ARP 2600, Prophet or Elka Synthex. Although designed as arranger workstations, WX series had some professional synthesizer capabilities like filter and cutoff (resonance) editing with an integrated powerful 16-track sequencer. The company also offered more sophisticated versions of the WX series as S series synthesizers. The S2 was similar to a Kurzweil K2000 for its functionalities such as optional sampling, and layout and patch manipulation. RealPiano Expander and RP-X From the 1990s to 2000, Generalmusic made a physically modeled, digital half-rack piano module called the RealPiano Expander. It featured realistic, physically modelled grand pianos with continuous damper pedal functionality. The RealPiano Expander has a delicate LCD readout that is prone to failure. This is due to the internal placement of the LCD ribbon wire in proximity to the top front edge of the plastic front bezel. To prevent damage to the LCD ribbon wire, users should not place heavy objects on top of the module. Users have replaced the LCD ribbon wire themselves. A damaged LCD ribbon wire does not affect sound quality or other functions at all. The device also has a few bugs related to key velocity that were never corrected in the upgradable EPROM firmware. The RealPiano Expander was succeeded by the GEM RP-X half-rack module in 2006. The RP-X featured the DRAKE (DSP RISC Advanced Keyboard Engine) which simulates a Fazioli F308 and Steinway & Sons grand piano among other instruments. Further developments Next-generation Generalmusic arranger keyboards were the WK series. Again, they offered a more sophisticated SK series as a synth-arranger alternative and Equinox as a standalone Kurzweil K2500 clone.

In addition to Genesys, the company offered an entry-level version named GK series and a simplified WK version named WK-1000/2000. Generalmusic also produced digital pianos, the Promega series, which attracted more interest than their synthesizer products.

As of July 2015, there were plans to launch a reissue of the classic Elka Synthex synthesizer, and a crowdfounding campaign was set on Indiegogo.

The helix- turn-helix motif is shown in deep red. Tet Repressor proteins (otherwise known as TetR) are proteins playing an important role in conferring antibiotic resistance to large categories of bacterial species. Tetracycline (tc) is a broad family of antibiotics to which bacteria have evolved resistance. Tc normally kills bacteria by binding to the bacterial ribosome and halting protein synthesis. The expression of tc resistance genes is regulated by the repressor TetR. TetR represses the expression of TetA, a membrane protein that pumps out substances toxic to the bacteria like tc, by binding the tetA operator. In tc resistant bacteria, TetA will pump out tc before it can bind to the ribosome because the repressive action of TetR on TetA is halted by binding of tc to TetR. Therefore, TetR may have an important role in helping scientists to better understand mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and how to treat antibiotic resistant bacteria. TetR is one of many proteins in the TetR protein family, which is so named because TetR is the most well characterized member. TetR is used in artificially engineered gene regulatory networks because of its capacity for fine regulation of promoters. In the absence of tc or analogs like aTc, basal expression of TetR-regulated promoters is low, but expression rises sharply in the presence of even a minute quantity of tc. The tetA gene is also present in the widely used E. coli cloning vector pBR322, where it is often referred to by the name of its tetracycline-resistance phenotype, TetR, not to be confused with TetR.  Structure & Function  Tetracycline-magnesium complex (blue) bound to cavity of TetR (green). HTH motif shown in pink -note conformational change. TetR functions as a homodimer. Each monomer consists of ten alpha helices connected by loops and turns. The overall structure of TetR can be broken down into two DNA-binding domains (one per monomer) and a regulatory core, which is responsible for tetracycline recognition and dimerization. TetR dimerizes by making hydrophobic contacts within the regulatory core. There is a binding cavity for tetracycline in the outer helices of the regulatory domain. When tetracycline binds this cavity, it causes a conformational change that affects the DNA- binding domain so that TetR is no longer able to bind DNA. As a result, TetA and TetR are expressed. There is still some debate in the field whether tetracycline derivatives alone can cause this conformational change or whether tetracycline must be in complex with magnesium to bind TetR. (TetR typically binds tetracycline-Mg2+ complexes inside bacteria, but TetR binding to tetracycline alone has been observed in vitro.) TetR (purple and salmon) in complex with its target DNA sequence. HTH motifs are shown in red binding to the major grooves of the DNA. PDB: 1QPI The DNA-binding domains of TetR recognize a 15 base pair palindromic sequence of the TetA operator. These domains mainly consist of a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that is common in TetR protein family members (see below). However, the N-terminal residues preceding this motif have also been shown to be important for DNA binding. Although these residues do not directly contact the DNA, they pack against the HTH and this packing is essential for binding. The HTH motifs have mostly hydrophobic interactions with major grooves of the target DNA. Binding of TetR to its target DNA sequence causes changes in both the DNA and TetR. TetR causes widening of the major grooves as well as kinking of the DNA; one helix of the HTH motif of TetR adopts a 310 helical turn as the result of complex DNA interactions.  TetR Protein Family  HTH motif alignment of three TetR family members: MtrR (magenta), SimR (cyan), & AmtR (green) As of June 2005, this family of proteins had about 2,353 members that are transcriptional regulators. (Transcriptional regulators control gene expression.) These proteins contain a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif that is the DNA-binding domain. The second helix is considered to be most important for DNA sequence specificity and often recognizes nucleic acids within the major groove of the double helix. In the majority of the family members, this motif is on the N-terminal end of the protein and is highly conserved. The high conservation of the HTH motif is not observed for the other domains of the protein. The differences observed in these other regulatory domains are likely due to differences in the molecules that each family member senses. TetR protein family members are mostly transcriptional repressors, meaning that they prevent the expression of certain genes at the DNA level. These proteins can act on genes with various functions including antibiotic resistance, biosynthesis and metabolism, bacterial pathogenesis, and response to cell stress.

It is located on the northern edge of the Bulgarka Nature Park, between the park and the city of Gabrovo. It presents the Bulgarian customs, culture and craftsmanship. It spans over an area of 7 ha and contains a total of 50 objects, including water installations and houses with craftsmen's workshops attached. As a whole, the complex's goal is to illustrate the architecture, way of life and economy of Gabrovo and the region during the Bulgarian National Revival. Water mill The museum's construction started in 1963 under the direction and project of Lazar Donkov. The pre-existing Karadzheyka water-mill, built around 1780, was thoroughly reconstructed, with the other objects being constructed later. The complex was opened on 7 September 1964 and proclaimed a national park in 1967, as well as a monument of culture in 1971. The park features typical Bulgarian revival houses with two floors, bay windows, a clock tower, and a beautifully decorated house by Saakov featuring 21 windows. Using original instruments and following the old traditions, locals represent around 20 characteristics of the regional crafts such as wood-carving, pottery, coppersmith crafts, furriery, cutlery making, needlework etc. There are shops for souvenirs. There are numerous restaurants in the park where tourist could consume local Bulgarian cuisine. There are visitors to the park, from all over the world, all the year round, especially during the annual Christian festivals celebrated in the park, namely, Palm Sunday and Easter. Sokolski Monastery is situated several kilometers away from Etar.

Kerr was born in Aberdeen. His military career began when he was commissioned into the Gordon Highlanders on a Special Regular Commission shortly after leaving university in 1970. He served in Cyprus before his first posting to Northern Ireland in 1972, where he worked as an undercover intelligence officer. Between 1972 and 1987 he worked in a variety of posts related to army intelligence in Northern Ireland, Berlin, and at army training centres in Great Britain. He transferred to a Regular Commission in 1974 and transferred to the Intelligence Corps in 1977. He was promoted Lieutenant in 1971, Captain in 1974, Major in 1980, Lieutenant- Colonel in 1987, Colonel in 1993, and Brigadier in 1998. In 1987, then Lieutenant-Colonel Kerr became head of the Force Research Unit, a military intelligence organisation that ran agents in both Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups. Much controversy stemmed from the amount of military intelligence the FRU gave to the loyalist groups. In October 1997, Kerr was appointed as military attaché at the British embassy in Beijing. While he was there, his name was published by the Sunday Herald as a consequence of the investigation into the FRU by the Stevens Inquiry. A former PSNI Chief Constable, Sir Hugh Orde, said Gordon Kerr, former head of the Army's secret Force Research Unit (FRU), should have been put on trial.

Early life and career  Barriscale was born Elizabeth Barry Scale in Hoboken, New Jersey to Irish immigrants from County Cork. Her cousins were actresses Edith and Mabel Taliaferro. In the first decade of the 20th century Barriscale worked in the legitimate theater on Broadway and on the road as movies were not popular for stage actors yet.Bessie Barriscale; IBDb.com She began her film career in 1913, and worked intensively for New York Motion Picture Company and Triangle Film Corporation (among other studios) until she announced her retirement in the early 1930s. In 1918, Barriscale was contracted by J.L. Frothingham of B.B. Features and the Roberson Cole Company to make 16 films. B.B. Features was an Arizona corporation. The movies were to be completed, produced, and delivered by January 21, 1921. At this time, Miss Barriscale's managers insured her life for a half million dollars against eventualities. The total cost of the features totaled more than $1,000,000. Barriscale and her husband Howard Hickman, 1915 Barriscale was enthusiastic about William Shakespeare and wanted to bring one of his plays to the screen. The actress was also an excellent swimmer. In The Woman Michael Married (1919), she was featured in a movie adapted from a novel by Annette Kellermann. Barriscale went so far as to hire a swimming and diving instructor and took lessons in Venice, California. A 90-foot pool was constructed at Brunton Studios where the scenes were shot. The film was directed by Henry Kolker. Barriscale in 1916 In 1919, she traveled with her husband—actor, director, and film producer—Howard C. Hickman and their small son on a world tour. They anticipated producing motion pictures during their journey and traveled with a cameraman. In 1921, Barriscale came east to play in The Skirt. The play was to travel to Philadelphia and Boston after opening in Washington, D.C.. Later the production appeared in New York City. In prior years, Barriscale participated in plays for the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles and once appeared in Belasco productions, notably Bird of Paradise written by Richard Walton Tully. She played a princess named Luana. During the early years, Barriscale was in vaudeville, with two-a-day, three-a-day, and even four-a-day performances not uncommon. Actor Jackie Coogan and his parents purchased the home of Bessie Barriscale in Pellisier Square, Los Angeles in February 1922. The residence was valued at $45,000. Barriscale returned to the stage in Women Go On Forever. She had been married 21 years and had a son age 20 at this time. The production opened at the Hollywood Music Box in March 1928. She played a \\"housewife type,\\" and confessed to having rehearsed for the role in a gingham dress she took from the wardrobe of her home in Santa Monica, California. Her feet were slightly smaller than her shoes. She said she had been working at home for several years and had just learned to cook.  Death  Barriscale died in Kentfield, California on June 30, 1965. She is buried next to her husband, Howard C. Hickman, at the Mount Tamalpais Cemetery in San Rafael, California.  Honors  For her contributions to the film industry, Barriscale received a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960. Her star is located at 6652 Hollywood Boulevard.  Filmography  Original caption: \\"Howard C. Hickman, husband and director of Bessie Barriscale, shows leading man Jack Holt how to make love to Mrs. Hickman.\\" This appears to be a production still from Kitty Kelly, M.D. (1919).

It consists of a U-shaped mouth that grips the heel of the boot, and a flat area to which weight can be applied with the opposite foot. To operate it, the user places the heel of the boot in the mouth of the jack, stands on the back of the device with the other foot, and pulls his foot free of the front boot. The process is then repeated to remove the other boot. The boot jack has several advantages over the removal of boots by hand. By allowing the wearer to pull his foot straight up and out of the boot, and by using his full body weight to hold the boot in place, far greater leverage and a much more secure grip are possible than can be achieved with the hands. In addition, the wearer is spared the inconvenience of having to bend over or sit down to remove the boots, or directly handle them if they are dirty. The function of the boot jack can be approximated with a variety of other objects that may be on hand, ranging from a convenient piece of furniture to a rifle butt, but these generally cannot remove the boot as easily as a proper boot jack. An adequate naturally occurring bootjack is formed by the base of cabbage palm Sabal palmetto leaf and these leaf bases are consequently called bootjacks. Additionally, the sole of a boot still being worn can also function as an improvised jack, but the wearer using one foot to remove the opposite boot often lacks proper leverage to successfully remove a snug-fitting boot, particularly a tall boot. A cast metal boot jack shaped like the head of a steer In addition to simple, utilitarian models made of wood or a synthetic material, representational cast iron boot jacks are also available. The U shape of the jack is formed by artistic elements, such as the horns of a steer, antennae of an insect or snail, or other, often humorous or whimsical, designs.

It was opened on 2 January 1835, when Bulgaria was still part of the Ottoman Empire, with the financial help of Vasil Aprilov, Nikolay Palauzov, Vasil Rasheev and other wealthy Bulgarians and was based on the Bell-Lancaster method. Formed as the Gabrovo School, it took the name of its primary benefactor, Vasil Aprilov, in 1889. The school still exists today, having returned to its historic building in 1992 and it is one of the most prestigious high schools in Bulgaria. History=Establishment and development The April High School was established during the Bulgarian Renaissance as the first Bulgarian high school. Its origins and development are inextricably linked with the ideas, activities and generosity of the ideologue of modern Bulgarian education Vasil Aprilov. The high school grew on the basis of the Gabrovo Mutual School, opened on the initiative of Aprilov and the Odessa circle of Bulgarians in 1835. The school is the first modern Bulgarian secular school and gave impetus to the opening of similar schools in other cities in the Bulgarian lands. Its graduates are some of the most prominent Revival educators such as Neofit Rilski, Joseph Kovachev, Kalist Lukov, Tsvetan Semerdzhiev, etc. The school was public and free for children from all over the country. With the help and donation of Vasil Aprilov and his closest associate and supporter Nikolay Palauzov, on April 24, 1840, the first public school library was established. In 1857, another prominent Revival activist, a graduate of the school and an Aprilov scholarship holder, Todor Burmov, reformed the curricula and the school moved into the next educational level - a class school. Only 10 years later, in 1867, the teacher Yosif Kovachev introduced the teaching of the \\"sound method\\" for the first time. Meanwhile, the construction of a special school building was in progress. During his visit to Gabrovo in the summer of 1847, Vasil Aprilov opened a subscription list to raise funds for the construction. The building was built in several stages: in 1847–1851, the masonry on the first floor was made by an unknown master; in 1872–1873, the building was completed by Usta Gencho Kanev from Tryavna. It was built in a way that was similar to the building of the Richelieu Lyceum in Odessa. It was located, according to the then framework of the city, on its outskirts, in one of the \\"most wholesome\\" and \\"most hygienic” places. The building was finally completed after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1880–1881, when its middle part was finished and a number of structural improvements were made. However, on August 26, 1873 the high school moved to a new place and thus became the first school to have its own, specially built building. The class of 1873 was the first complete class to graduate from the school. The inherited tradition, the good teachers and the material base enabled the school to keep its position as one of the most elite in the country even after the Liberation. On August 12, 1878, the high school was declared state-owned. A little later, on July 20, 1889, on the occasion of the solemn celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Vasil Aprilov, it adopted the name \\"State Men's Aprilov High School\\". The school's staff consisted of prominent pedagogues, specialists and public figures such as Trayko Kitanchev, Tsvetan Radoslavov, Evtim Dabev, Ivan Urumov, Stanimir Stanimirov, Sava Sirmanov and others. At the school they expand their pedagogical experience and had the opportunity to implement new educational ideas. Some of them were authors and translators of text- and handbooks. The high school drew students from all over Bulgaria. According to data for the first four school years after the Liberation, it was the largest secondary school in the country. More than 183 of the students came from lands outside of Bulgaria's borders, from Macedonia and Western Thrace to Romania. Among its graduates are some of the leading Bulgarian intellectuals and public figures such as Aleko Konstantinov, Nikola Mihov, Stoyan Romanski, Anastas Ishirkov, Petko Staynov and others. As early as September, 1916, the high school became mixed. In the years after September 9, 1944, the school retained its leading place in the Bulgarian educational system. It changed its educational profile several times. After 1987 In 1988, the school acquired a new status, becoming a high school with a humanitarian profile, which studies subjects such as literature, history, philosophy and arts. Initially, the program contained elements of classical education such as the study of Old Bulgarian and Latin, the history of culture and the history of philosophy. A few years later, the study of ancient languages dropped out of the program with the aim that the foreign language profile is strengthened. In 1992, after its transformation into a state school, it received its current name, the National Aprilov High School. At that time the Aprilov High School was housed in the building of the Mathematical High School. In 1996, a decision was made by the Gabrovo Municipal Council to return the school to its historic building in the city center, which for the previous few decades housed the National Museum of Education, founded in 1973. On February 9, 1998, the President Petar Stoyanov together with the mayor Nikolay Dachev inaugurated the renovated historical building of the Aprilov High School. This happened after a 25-year interruption of school activities in this building. From 1992 to 1996 the two institutions were administratively merged under the name National Aprilov High School with a museum of education. This merger has been terminated. The museum is still housed in the west wing of the same building. On the occasion of the 175th anniversary of its founding in 2010, the school received the badge of honor of the President Georgi Parvanov \\"for the continuation of the national educational tradition and for remarkable achievements in modern education\\". Education The school is ranked among the most elite secondary schools in the Bulgaria. Currently, it enrolls students in 3 language and 2 humanitarian classes. The main foreign languages studied are English and German, and in addition to them, French and Greek are taught as second languages. The humanitarian profiles are Bulgarian language and literature and history. Many specialized and extracurricular forms of education are also offered. Over the years, graduates of the school have been winners of prestigious national and international student competitions. According to data, 95% of the school's graduates continue their education in universities. Traditions=April Days of Culture Since the early 1990s, the school has been the organizer of the April Days of Culture, which are held annually in the second half of May. The event includes student seminars, theater performances, concerts and literary readings. Traditionally, the days of culture end with the graduation of 12th grade students. Aprilovtsi return The initiative \\"Aprilovtsi return\\" is a continuation of the idea that arose on the occasion of the 180th anniversary of the Aprilov High School, to organize an annual Alumni Ball, which will meet the past and present of the high school through informal, festive, creative and working meetings of graduates from different grades of the school. Successful and accomplished students of the Aprilov High School return to tell about their path, the meaning of what they have achieved and the effort they have put into their careers.

It is the capital of Dąbrowa County. Before reorganization (in 1999) Dąbrowa Tarnowska was part of Tarnów Voivodeship (1975–1998). Population is 11,402 (2008). Geography Dąbrowa lies on the Bren river, on the boundary of two geographic regions, the Carpathian Foothills and the Sandomierz Basin. The town is a home to a football club Dabrovia Dąbrowa Tarnowska (established in 1922), which plays in the regional league, the sixth level of Polish football league system. Furthermore, Dąbrowa has ruins of a Baroque palace of the Lubomirski family, as well as a 19th-century synagogue. The name of the town comes from oak groves, called dąbrowy in Polish, which were abundant here in the past. Dąbrowa used to be called Dambrawa Wielka (Dambrawa Magna) as well as Dobrowa, and finally the adjective “Tarnowska” was added to it, to distinguish it from Dąbrowa Górnicza and Dąbrowa Białostocka. History Dąbrowa Tarnowska was first mentioned as a parish village in 1326. At that time, it already was a large village, which belonged to the noble Ligeza family, and had a mill, fish farm, 60 agricultural farms and a folwark. In 1614, a new parish church was built by Mikolaj Ligeza who in the 1630s also built a defensive palace (palazzo in fortezza), protected by the Bagienica river. The palace was square shaped, with a rampart and four bastions. In 1683-1693, Michal Lubomirski built a new, Baroque palace, and as a result, the old palace ceased to be a family residence, and was turned into a brewery. In the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Dąbrowa belonged to the Sandomierz Voivodeship. Dąbrowa Tarnowska was granted town charter probably in 1693, and the town was developed east of the Lubomirski palace. In 1771, a new, large church was built, and following the first partition of Poland (see Partitions of Poland), the town became part of Austrian Galicia, where it remained from 1772 until 1918. In 1846, the Lubomirski palace burned in a fire, after which it was never rebuilt. A post-office named DOMBROWA was opened in 1858.Handbook of Austria and Lombardy-Venetia Cancellations on the Postage Stamp Issues 1850-1864, by Edwin MUELLER, 1961. The town was part of the Austria side after the compromise of 1867, head of the DABROWA district, one of the 78 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in Austrian Galicia province (Crown land).Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den österreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 In 1948-1965, a church was built in the location of the palace, all that remains of the complex is its main gate. In 1906, the rail line from Tarnów to Szczucin was opened, and in the Second Polish Republic, Dąbrowa was part of the Kraków Voivodeship.

She was baptized on 23 September 1709 and buried on 20 January 1749. Edward married for his second wife Mary Long, the daughter and heiress of Captain Stephen Long of Sandwich. They had eight children, five of whom survived infancy. He was apprenticed to his father on a surgical apprenticeship in 1728. On completion of this in 1735 he was made a freeman of the city of Canterbury and moved to Faversham in Kent in that same year, where he practised as a surgeon. He was an antiquary, bibliophile, scientist, botanist and fossil collector. He wrote a number of papers and books. 1774 saw his Plantae Favershemiensis appear, 1777 his History of the Town and Port of Faversham. He also re-published the anonymous 16th century play Arden of Faversham, and was the first person to suggest that Shakespeare had a hand in writing it.

Both the name of the natives and of the region are synonymous (Kodava-Kodavu; Kodaga-Kodagu; Coorgs-Coorg). The Haleri dynasty=Early Haleri The Haleri dynasty was an offshoot of Keladi Nayakas also called Ikkeri Arasu dynasty. Kodagu was independent of Mysore, which was hard pressed by enemies, and a prince of the Ikkeri or Bednur family (perhaps related to the Changalvas) succeeded in bringing the whole country under his sway, his descendants continuing to be Rajas of Kodagu till 1834. The capital was removed in 1681 by Muddu Raja to Madikeri (Mercara). Mysore Sultan A dungeon at Seringapatam. Hindu Kodavas, Nairs and Mangalorean Catholics who refused to embrace Islam were imprisoned into such dungeons. A daughter of Dodda Vira Rajendra Omkareshwara Temple built by Linga Raja in Madikeri In 1770 a disputed succession led to the intervention of Hyder Ali of Mysore in favour of Linga Raja, who had fled to him for justice, and whom he placed on the throne benevolently. As a gesture of his gratitude, the Raja ceded certain territories and offered to pay tribute. On Linga Rajas death in 1780 Hyder Ali interned his sons, who were minors, in a fort in Mysore, and installed a governor as their guardian at Mercara with a Mysore garrison. In 1782, however, the Kodava rose in rebellion and drove out the Mysore troops. Tipu Sultan first negotiated with the Coorgs, worked an amicable settlement and made them feel secure. But then a surprise attack was launched upon the Kodavas following which 500 were killed and over 40,000 Kodavas fled to the woods and concealed themselves in the mountains. The Coorgs were defeated and a large number of them (including women and shildren) were taken captive. The territories seized were held down by garrisons in four forts. The captured Coorgis were subjected to forcible conversions to Islam. The prisoners were converted into Muslim Ahmadees. The young men were all forcibly circumcised and incorporated into the Ahmadee Corps. They were trained and made to form 8 Assad Ilahi (Asadulai) and Ahmadi Risalas (or regiments). In 1788, however, Dodda Vira Raja (or Vira Rajendra Wodeyar), with his wife and his brothers Linga Raja and Appaji, succeeded in escaping from his captivity, at Periapatam and, placing himself at the head of a Kodava rebellion, aligned with the British and succeeded in driving the forces of Tipu (who had aligned with the French) out of the country. On the spot where he had first met the British commander, General Abercromby, the Kodagu Raja founded the city of Virarajendrapet (this is now usually called Virajpet). Later Haleri 200px Dodda Vira Raja, who, in consequence of his mind becoming unhinged, was guilty towards the end of his reign of hideous atrocities, died in 1809 without male heirs, leaving his favourite daughter Devammji as Rani. His brother Linga Raja, however, after acting as regent for his niece, announced in 1811, his own assumption of the government. He died in 1820 and was succeeded by his son Chikka Vira Raja, a youth of twenty, and a monster of sensuality and cruelty. Among his victims were all the members of the families of his predecessors, including Devammaji. The last few Rajas and their family members married members of the Mukkatira and Palanganda Kodava families. At last, in 1832, evidence of treasonable designs on the Raja's part led to inquiries on the spot by the British resident at Mysore, as the result of which, and of the Raja's refusal to amend his ways, a British force marched into Kodagu in 1834 after a medium-sized war when the Raja surrendered. It was a short but bloody campaign that occurred in which a number of British men and officers were killed. Near Somwarpet, where the Coorgs were led by Mathanda Appachu the resistance had been most furious. But this Coorg campaign came to a quick end when the Raja himself cowardly surrendered to the British. British rule Coorg in 1859 Coorg province in British India in 1913 Nalknad Palace On 11 April 1834, the raja was deposed by Colonel Fraser, the political agent with the force, and on 7 May the state was formally annexed to the East India Company's territory, as Coorg. In 1852 the Raja, who had been deported to Vellore, obtained leave to visit England with his favourite daughter Gauramma, to whom he wished to give a European education. On 30 June she was baptised, Queen Victoria being one of her godmothers; she afterwards married a British officer who, after her death in 1864, mysteriously disappeared together with their child. Vira Raja himself died in 1863 and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery.Coorg History: CoorgNews.In website The Amara Sulya Freedom Movement of 1837 began when the British bifurcated Amara Sulya from Kodagu Samsthaana and demanded agricultural tax to be paid in the form of money by Sulya residents. The British had also deposed the Raja. The freedom movement to reinstate tradition over English Hegemony was led Sri Kedambadi Ramè Gowda, Subedar Sri Guddemane Appaiah Gowda, Koojugodu Mallayya Gowda and Chetty Kudiya among others. After the rebellion the British presented Coorg chiefs who had remained loyal with gifts including horses, while a special Coorg Medal was awarded to chiefs, local leaders and those Kodavas who had supported the British in executing fellow Indians. Coorg (Kodagu) was the smallest province in India, with an area of only 1,582 square miles (4,100 km²). As a province of British India, it was administered by a commissioner, subordinate to the Governor- General of India through the resident of Mysore, who was also officially chief commissioner of Coorg. Later freedom fighters from Kodagu supported the National Independence Movement. One of them, Pandyanda Belliappa was known as Kodagu's Gandhi.

After India's independence in 1947, Coorg became a province, and in 1950 a state by name of Coorg State of Republic of India. In 1952 elections to the Coorg Legislative Assembly were held.

History Newspaper ad for the 1922 version of the Royal. The American Royal began as a cattle show in 1899 in the Kansas City Stockyards. The name \\"American Royal\\" was inspired by a 1901 editorial in beef industry publication Kansas City Drovers Telegram entitled \\"Call it the American Royal.\\" The editorial said the Royal Agricultural Society in England has a similar event called the Royal Show. The first American Royal horse show was added in 1907, and has grown to include five shows (Quarter Horse Show, Hunter-Jumper Horse Show, Arabian Horse Show, American Saddlebred, Youth Horse Show and a Cutting Horse show). In 1926, the American Royal invited vocational agriculture students to judge livestock.

During World War II, the Royal complex was converted into a glider factory. No event was held in 1917–18 nor 1942–45. 2020 saw some events moving to digital caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. New complex American Royal Complex The new American Royal Complex was constructed in 1992 to replace the outdated facility constructed in 1926. The complex was designed by the architecture firm Black and Veatch and constructed by Walton Construction. The new complex consists of a museum and visitor center, three exhibition halls, Hale Arena, a theatre, a full-service restaurant and concession stand, as well as the administrative offices. In 1993, the new facilities were flooded but was restored in time for the American Royal livestock shows to continue that autumn. Hale Arena has since replaced Hy-Vee Arena and the Sprint Center as arenas where the livestock and rodeo shows are held each autumn. The barbecue competition had been held on the complex grounds, but was moved to the Arrowhead Stadium parking lots in 2015 and then to Kansas Speedway in 2016. =American Royal Museum= The American Royal Museum is open by appointment and for extended hours during the American Royal season. Exhibits include horses, veterinary medicine, the history of the American Royal, agriculture in Kansas City, and horse, rodeo and livestock show clothing, saddles and memorabilia.

Komsomolskaya Square (), known as Kalanchyovskaya before 1932, is a square in Moscow, with a blend of revivalist Tsarist and Stalinist architecture. It is referred to informally as Three Station Square (; lit. \\"Ploshchad' tryokh vokzalov\\") after the three rail termini situated there: Leningradsky, Yaroslavsky, and Kazansky. These stations connect Moscow with Saint Petersburg, northwestern Russia, the Volga region, and Siberia via the Trans-Siberian Railway. Its origins lay with the construction of the Moscow-Saint Petersburg Railway in the 1840s, when Kalanchyovskoye Field outside the Garden Ring was selected to allocate the Nicholas Railway Station (later renamed Leningradsky). In 1862 the Yaroslavsky Rail Terminal, a terminus of the Trans-Siberian Railway, was constructed nearby. On the opposite side of the field the Kazansky Rail Terminal was inaugurated two years later. Until 1909, a railway line leading to Kursky Rail Terminal traversed the square; it is now elevated so as not to interfere with street traffic. During the Soviet period, four other structures were added. Alexey Shchusev designed a Constructivist edifice, the Central Club of Railway Workers, in 1925-1926\\\\. The square received its present name, in the honour of the Komsomol (Communist Union of Youth) members, in 1932. A Stalinist skyscraper of the Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya Hotel and a Neoclassical vestibule of the Komsomolskaya-Koltsevaya metro station were completed in the early 1950s. The most recent addition is the Moskovsky department store on the eastern side of the square (1983). In 2003, at the behest of the Ministry of Transportation, a bronze statue of Pavel Melnikov (1804-1880) was erected on the square.

The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the patient and the physician to have access to empirical information on established treatment benefits and side effects. Research on this issue has been done upon prostate cancer. Example of prostate cancer An example of such trade-off is prostate cancer treatment. Distress of this treatment includes urinary and bowel symptoms and waning sexual function.Helgason ÁR, Adolfsson J, Dickman P, Fredrikson M, Arver S, Steineck G. Waning sexual function - the most important disease- specific distress for patients with prostate cancer. Br. J. Cancer. 1996: 73: 1417-1421. An important factor here is that prevalence of these symptoms and the distress they cause varies between types of treatment and individual patients.Helgason ÁR, Adolfsson J, Dickman P, Fredrikson M, Steineck G. Distress due to unwanted side-effects of prostate cancer treatment is related to impaired well-being (quality of life). Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases. 1998: 1:128-133. Patient trade-off shows the importance in collecting information needed to make such decisions. Life expectancy and sexual function trade off One option is to trade off an intact sexual function for the possibility of a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. A Swedish study found that the willingness to do this kind of trade-off varied considerably among the men included in the study. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. Stress of making trade-off decisions A substantial proportion of patients and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten prostate cancer patients have no one to confide in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.Helgason ÁR, Dickman PW, Adolfsson J, Steineck G.

He is the father of Robert Ng. In 1997, Forbes listed the two as the 30th richest people in the world. History Ng Teng Fong was born in a small village in Putian, Fujian, China. The eldest of 11 children, he moved to Singapore with his family when he was six. Having little formal education, Ng worked at his parents’ soy sauce factory and as a bicycle repairman in his younger days. He started his first business with a provision shop and subsequently found his niche in the business of property development. Ng managed to raise enough capital to establish Far East Organization (FEO) around 1960. FEO’s first residential development project was Jalan Pacheli in Serangoon Gardens which was completed in 1962. Ng expanded into the hotel industry with the Singapura Forum Hotel and Hilton Singapore Hotel on Orchard Road and other residential developments at Katong and Watten Estate. By the 1980s, he was the largest private landowner and developer in the country. His influence on Singapore's prime retail property, including the development of malls such as Far East Plaza and Lucky Plaza gave him the moniker \\"King of Orchard Road\\". He ventured into the Hong Kong property markets in 1970s. Ng's family owns the development corporations Far East Organization and Sino Group. Far East Organization was established as an umbrella for Ng's Singapore-based companies, which includes Far East Hospitality, Far East Orchard, and Yeo Hiap Seng. Hong Kong-based Sino Group is a sister group to the FEO. The group oversees 180 privately held developments and investment companies and two publicly-listed companies. Far East Organization is Singapore’s largest private property developer and Sino Group is a major player in Hong Kong’s property market. Despite Ng Teng Fong's vast fortune, he had a reputation for leading a frugal and miserly lifestyle. Though he controlled at least a quarter of Singapore's housing market, Ng lived in the same house he'd had for 30 years, and used to take his own lunch on the airplanes. Ng suffered a cerebral hemorrhage on 23 January 2010 and, after an unsuccessful operation, died on 2 February 2010 at the age of 82. At his death, he was reportedly the richest person in Singapore. At the time of his death, Sino Group was one of Hong Kong's largest real estate developers, and Far East Organization remained one of the largest landholders in Singapore. Far East Organization also owns The Fullerton Singapore and numerous other landmark hotels and other properties. His family donated $125 million in 2011 for the building of a Singaporean hospital in Jurong East and the Ng Teng Fong General Hospital was subsequently named after the late property tycoon.  Personal life  Ng was married to Tan Kim Choo and had seven children. His eldest son, Robert Ng Chee Siong oversees the Sino Group in Hong Kong with his son Daryl. Ng's younger son, Philip Ng Chee Tat is the chief executive of Far East Organization since 1991 and served as Singapore's Non-Resident Ambassador to Chile and Argentina. Robert and Philip's combined family net worth was estimated to be US$9.7 billion in 2017. The family's wealth is held through Sino Group and Far East Organization.

Several fortifications were built successively on the site, near the English-Scottish border. The last was slighted in 1567; it is a ruin today. Early history The Votadini or Gododdin are thought to have been the first to defend this site as its original Brythonic name, dyn barr, means 'the fort of the point'. By the 7th century, Dunbar Castle was a central defensive position of the Kings of Bernicia, an Anglian kingdom that took over from the British Kingdom of Bryneich. Northumbria During the Early Middle Ages, Dunbar Castle was held by an Ealdorman owing homage to either the Kings at Bamburgh Castle, or latterly the Kings of York. In 678 Saint Wilfrid was imprisoned at Dunbar, following his expulsion from his see of York by Ecgfrith of Northumbria. Later, Dunbar was said to have been burnt by Kenneth MacAlpin, King of the Scots. Certainly he is on record in possession of the castle.Miller, James, The History of Dunbar, Dunbar, 1830:8 Kingdom of the Scots In the 10th and early 11th centuries, the Norsemen made increasing inroads in Scotland and in 1005 a record exists of a Patrick de Dunbar, under Malcolm II, engaged against the Norse invaders in the north at Murthlake a town of Marr where alongside Kenneth, Thane of the Isles, and Grim, Thane of Strathearn, he was slain. The first stone castle is thought to have been built by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria, after his exile from England, following the Harrowing of the North, by William the Conqueror after Gospatric took refuge at the court of Malcolm III of Scotland. Gospatric was a powerful landowner in both kingdoms and could summon many men, which encouraged Malcolm to give him more lands in East Lothian, the Merse and Lauderdale, as recompense for those lost further south and in return for loyalty as is usual under the feudal system. Sir Walter Scott argued that Cospatric or Gospatrick was a contraction of Comes Patricius. In any case, King Malcolm III is recorded as bestowing the manor of Dunbar &c.;, on \\"the expatriated Earl of Northumberland\\". Structure The body of buildings measured in excess of one hundred and sixty five feet from east to west, and in some places up to two hundred and ten feet from north to south. The South Battery, which Grose supposes to have been the citadel or keep, is situated on a detached perpendicular rock, only accessible on one side, seventy two feet high, and is connected to the main part of the castle by a passage of masonry measuring sixty nine feet. The interior of the citadel measures fifty four feet by sixty within the walls. Its shape is octagonal. Five of the gun-ports remain, which are called the 'arrow-holes'. They measure four feet at the mouth and only sixteen inches at the other end. The buildings are arched and extend eight feet from the outer walls, and look into an open court, whence they derive their light.Miller, James, The History of Dunbar, Dunbar, 1830, pps 2 – 6 19th-century engraving of the castle About the middle of the fortress, part of a wall remains, through which there is a gateway, surmounted with armorial bearings. ths gate seems to have led to the principal apartments. In the centre, are the arms of George, 10th Earl of Dunbar, who succeeded his father in 1369, and who besides the earldom of Dunbar and March, inherited the Lordship of Annandale and the Isle of Man from his heroic aunt, Black Agnes of Dunbar. They must have been placed there after his succession, as he was the first who assumed those sculptured Arms: viz, a large triangular shield, and thereon a lion rampant, within a bordure charged with eight roses. The shield is adorned with a helmet, carrying a crest: a horse's head bridled. On the right are the Arms of the Bruces, and on the left those of the Isle of Man. The castle towers had communication with the sea, and dip low in many places. North-east from the front of the castle is a large natural cavern, chiefly of black stone, which looks like the mouth of the Acheron – a place that leads to melancholy streams. This spot is supposed to have formed part of the dungeon where prisoners were confined, such as Gavin Douglas, Bishop of Dunkeld, who was a prisoner here in 1515. There is, however, also a dark postern which gives access to a rocky inlet from the sea, and it seems probable that it was through this that Sir Alexander Ramsay and his followers entered with a supply of provisions to the besieged in 1338. It was long said the castle was invulnerable, possibly because of the many sieges it sustained. The castle was built with a red stone similar to that found in the quarries near Garvald. Large masses of walls, which have fallen beneath the weight of time, appear to be vitrified or run together. In the north-west part of the ruins is an apartment about twelve feet square, and nearly inaccessible, which tradition states was the apartment of Mary, Queen of Scots. Later history The Castle remained the stronghold of the Earls of Dunbar until the forfeiture of George, Earl of March, in 1457, when the Castle was dismantled to prevent its occupation by the English. It was restored by James IV later in the century. In 1501 new iron window grills or yetts were provided.James Balfour Paul, Accounts of the Treasurer, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 86, 101, 116. The castle came under the control of the Duke of Albany and it was during this period that the bulwark to the west was built. It may have been designed by Antoine d'Arces, Sieur de la Bastie who was placed in charge of the castle in December 1514.Tabraham, Chris (1997) Scotland's Castles.

The English soldier Thomas Holcroft described the activities of Peter Landstedt, a lieutenant of the German mercenary Courtpennick (Konrad Pennick), on 24 September 1549. Despite cannon fire from the castle, Landstedt got a foothold in a house in Dunbar, and used the furniture to start fires in the town. Landstedt planned to make an entrenchment in front of the castle to place his guns, and he thought the walls of the castle near the town were \\"very old and low,\\" and now \\"revised with earth and mounds\\", these old walls being stone on the natural rock. He thought the old high walls of the inner court could be broken by bombardment to destroy the \\"first walls\\" of the castle. These plans were not realised.Stevenson, Joseph, ed., Selections from unpublished manuscripts in the College of Arms and the British Museum illustrating the reign of Mary Queen of Scotland, (1837), p.43-4 Reformation crisis In May 1560, an Italian engineer was working on further improvements for the French garrison.Haynes, Samuel, ed., A Collection of State Papers, (1740), p.314. These works were inspected by Robert Hamilton in Briggs, keeper of Linlithgow Palace and Master of the Royal Artillery, and Robert Montgomery in July 1560 on behalf of the Lords of the Congregation who reported that it was \\"more ample by the double than it was of before\\" and capable of holding 500 more soldiers. The new work was immediately demolished as a provision of the Treaty of Edinburgh. Local landowners were tasked with the demolition of part of a \\"rampire,\\" a rampart with its ditch and counter scarp, and a great platform for artillery.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 454 However, the French captain of the Castle, Corbeyran de Sarlabous refurbished the cavern which was within the area scheduled for demolition.Calendar State Papers Foreign Elizabeth, vol. 3 (London, 1865), no. 409 The Castle remained garrisoned by 60 French troops under the command of Sarlabous until September 1561.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (London, 1898), pp. 862, 452, 454. Mary, Queen of Scots Shortly after her return to Scotland in August 1561, Mary, Queen of Scots appointed her half-brother Lord John keeper of the castle.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 548. In August 1565, during the rebellion against Mary, Queen of Scots called the Chaseabout Raid, she ordered repairs to the gun emplacements and artillery, and hand tools that might be needed to re-build the ramparts during a siege.Hill Burton, John, ed., Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1887), p. 360. She was brought to the castle by the Earl of Bothwell and then confronted her enemies at the battle of Carberry Hill on 15 June 1567. There was a siege in September 1567 to eject Bothwell's supporters and the captain, Patrick Whitelaw or Quhytelaugh, and William Kirkcaldy of Grange was made keeper of the castle.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1563-1569, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1900), pp. 383, 387, 396: Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1545-1569, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), pp. 524, 565, 572-3, 575-6.

The Greek economic miracle is the period of sustained economic growth in Greece from 1950 to 1973.

Forced loans demanded by the occupying regime severely devalued the Greek drachma. After the end of the war, there was a bitter civil war until 1949. By 1950, the relative position of the Greek economy had dramatically deteriorated. The income per capita in purchasing power terms fell from 62% of France's in 1938 to about 40% in 1949.  Economic growth  Workmen grade the street in front of new housing constructed with the help of Marshall Plan funds in Greece. The rapid recovery of the Greek economy following the Greek Civil War was facilitated by a number of measures, especially, as in other European countries, by the grants and loans of the Marshall Plan. They also included a drastic devaluation of the drachma, attraction of foreign investments, significant development of the chemical industry, development of tourism and the services sector in general and massive construction activity connected with huge infrastructure projects and rebuilding in the Greek cities.Joanna Bens, Nikolaos Karagiannis, Abdelaziz Testas.

In \\"Europe in Crisis: Problems, Challenges, and Alternative Perspectives\\", Palgrave Macmillan (2015) p. 174Elaine Thomopoulos, \\"The History of Greece\\", ABC-CLIO (2011) p. 152 Greek growth rates were highest during the 1950s, often exceeding 10%, close to those of a modern tiger economy. Industrial production also grew annually by 10% for several years, mostly in the 1960s. Growth initially widened the economic gap between rich and poor, intensifying political divisions. In total, the Greek GDP grew for 54 of the 60 years following World War II and the Greek Civil War.Paul Bairoch, \\"Europe's GNP 1800-1975,\\" The Journal of European Economic History, a. 5, no. 2 (1976), pp. 273-340.

Aftermath Marginal GDP contractions were recorded in the 1980s, although these were partly counterbalanced by the evolution of the Greek economy during that time. Between the early 1970s and 1990s, double-digit inflation, often closer to 20% than 10%, was normal until monetary policies were changed to comply with the criteria for joining the Eurozone.http://www.global- rates.com/images/charts/gr-inflatie-chart-14-2043.jpg Gallery File:Koumaria 2.1 C.jpgIron ore mine in Thasos (1958) File:Ver10 C.jpgShiploading in Limenaria, Thasos, during the 1950s File:Eot- paliouri-1962-2.jpgXenia hotel in Paliouri, Chalkidiki (1962) File:Biamax Desert Bus 1964.jpgThe Desert Bus of Greek vehicle manufacturer Biamax (1964) File:OTE Telecom tower.jpgOTE Tower of Thessaloniki opened in 1966 File:Alta 1968.JPGAlta A200 (1968) See also * Economic history of Greece and the Greek world * Post–World War II economic expansion ReferencesFurther reading *Takis Fotopoulos, \\"Economic restructuring and the debt problem: the Greek case,\\" International Review of Applied Economics, Vol. 6, No. 1 (1992).

Since Coptic had ceased to be spoken as a mother tongue by this time, a change in education changed how the language was spoken. The two traditions of pronunciation in contemporary use arise from two successive reforms in the 19th and 20th centuries: * The \\"reformed pronunciation\\" or \\"Greco-Bohairic pronunciation\\", mandated by Cyril IV (1854–1861), models the pronunciation of the sounds of Coptic, after how the sounds written with the equivalent letters were pronounced in Modern Greek. * The \\"Old Bohairic pronunciation\\" aims to reconstruct the pronunciation of the language as it was before this reform. Reformed pronunciation (Greco-Bohairic) During the time of Pope Cyril IV of Alexandria (1854–1861), there were discussions between the Coptic and Greek Orthodox Churches of Alexandria about whether to unite, so one Patriarch would be the head of both Churches in Egypt. The unification did not come about, but one of the proposals made at the time was to make Coptic pronunciation conform more closely to Greek. The chief architect of this project was Arian G. Moftah, who taught Coptic in the Patriarchal Church at that time. Since the Coptic alphabet shares many letters with the Greek alphabet, he assumed that any change of Coptic pronunciation towards Greek would be a positive reform and would also assist with the expected union between the churches. The caveats are: a) There is no evidence that Coptic adopted the exact phonetic values of Greek alphabet. b) There is uncertainty which dialect of Greek was spoken predominantly in Egypt, or whether Copts spoke an Egyptian dialect of Greek. c) Greek has undergone several natural phonetic changes, to the extent that the Koine Greek phonetic values are not certain at this time. d) The assumption that reverting to the source language is a process of reform is based on the assumption that any source language should be the reference point for hybrid, or creole languages or pidgins. In modern linguistics, once a nation adopts a language or adopts elements of another language into their own, it becomes a separate entity, akin to Canadian French or American English, or Brazilian Portuguese, or other languages with influence from other languages as the influence of Arabic on Persian, Maltese, Turkish & Swahili. At the time, popular feeling in Egypt had been stirred up by the French military campaigns (1798–1801), whose scientists remained in Egypt for some years, and many people had come to feel that the European ideas and practices were superior to Egyptian (or Ottoman) customs. The Greco-Bohairic pronunciation introduced phonemes like , , and in addition to an increase in glottal stops. The reformed pronunciation (Greco-Bohairic pronunciation) was spread by the authority of the Klirikia (Theological Seminary) but not without controversy, and by the 1950s it had become established throughout Egypt except in a small number of parishes in upper Egypt that refuse to accept any priest from outside the local village. In the course of this campaign of reform, the old Bohairic pronunciation was often inaccurately referred to as Sahidic, the name of another Coptic dialect. However, some European Coptologists commented on the fact that the villagers of Upper Egypt retained a more authentic tradition, and wrote disparagingly about the Greek-influenced pronunciation. Most notably Dr G. Sobhy commented on Greco-Bohairic pronunciation in an article saying, \\"All modern books written on Coptic by native authors adopt more or less a mutilated form of Greek pronunciation and apply it entirely to their language. Unfortunately none of our native authors here knows sufficient Greek to realise the outstanding mistakes he is trying to form into rules applicable to the Coptic language.\\" Old Bohairic pronunciation During the 1960s, with the encouragement of Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, Dr Emile Maher studied the history of Coptic pronunciation and in 1968, he announced that he had rediscovered the Old Bohairic pronunciation. After completing a doctorate on the subject at Oxford University (Thesis available online), he returned to Egypt hoping to restore the older way of pronouncing Coptic in place of the reformed pronunciation (sometimes referred to as Greco-Bohairic). The Institute of Coptic Language, which studied and promoted the Old Bohairic pronunciation, came under strong opposition from some Church leaders, but the Pope continued to support Dr Maher, and ordained him priest (as Father Shenouda) in the 1990s. The Old Bohairic pronunciation is used in the Monastery of St. Shenouda in Rochester, New York, in which Father Shenouda Maher now serves. The Old Bohairic pronunciation is evidence- based, using archived sound recordings and transcriptions of the oral tradition of Zeneya, Dabeyya, and other villages made by various scholars such as Georgy Sobhy, Petraeus, Galtier, Maria Cramer, Rochmonteix, in addition to the works of W.H. Worrell and Vycichl. Maher also consulted documents held in libraries and monasteries throughout Egypt, including Coptic manuscripts written in the Arabic script, such as the Damanhour euchologion, and tenth- century Arabic texts written in Coptic letters, and he analysed scribal transcription errors in the manuscripts tradition.

It is the headquarters of the Malbazar subdivision. It lies about 65 km from Jalpaiguri and 55 km from Siliguri. History Before 1947 Malbazar was a very small place, mainly known for its tea gardens mostly owned by British people. Those tea gardens had a few Bengali white collar employees and the work force consisted of tribal people. After independence of India as well as partition of Bengal refugees from the then East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) started to settle here by cutting down forests. By that time, Dr. Narayan Chandra Bannerjee, Dr Amalendu Biswas (came from Pabna), Dr Tarak Mukherjee, Nripendra nath Choudhary who came there from Dacca established this city. Dr. Bannerjee had earned a lot of respect for his effective medical treatments and social services. He took initiatives to get the refugees settled there in an organised way. As a result, some colonies came up. Later, due to efforts of Dr. Bannerjee, Amalendu Biswas, Nripendra nath Choudhary, Sarat ch Ghosh, Dulal Sengupta, Makhan Bose established Adarsha Bidya Bhawan (a boys' high school). Bipin Bihari Bandyopadhyay established Subhasini Balika Vidyalay (a girls' high school) in the 1950s. The government Mal Grahmin Hospital was established. Biswas contributed a lot as the only dentist of Malbazar. Nath Choudhury had helped the refugees get settled. Soon, the police station was shifted to Malbazar from nearby Kranti. During that time, Jogesh Chandra Dutta was closely associated with Dr. Narayan Chandra Bannerjee, Dr Amalendu Biswas, Nripendra nath Choudhary and others. Jogesh Chandra Dutta was the only practicing ophthalmologist in that area. He was also closely associated with development of Mal RR Primary School. In the 1970s Malbazar got its fire service station. Later, a street was named after Dr. Narayan Chandra Bannerjee. The street is called \\"Dr. Narayan Banerjee Sarani\\" just behind Subhasini Balika Vidyalaya and Mal Adarsha Bidya Bhaban. Geography=Location Mal is at . Malbazar is one of the more important towns in Dooars. It is strategically located in the eastern part of the Dooars region. The town does not have much to offer tourists except for the Mal Park, but due to its location on the national highway, one can stay at Malbazar and visit the tourist destination of Eastern Dooars – Gorumara National Park, Chapramari Wildlife Reserve, Jhalong, Bindu, Samsing, Suntalekhola are among the tourist spots in this area.

Life and career Georges Anthony d'Offay was born in January 1940 in Sheffield to a French father. He began dealing in art in the late 1960s, operating from premises in Dering Street off the top of New Bond Street in London. He closed the gallery in 2001 and founded ARTIST ROOMS in 2008. He has been the recipient of the UK Montblanc de la Culture Arts Patronage Award (2009), The Prince of Wales Medal for Arts Philanthropy (2011) and the Paolozzi Medal (2011). He has been awarded Honorary Doctorates by The University of Edinburgh, De Montfort University, Leicester and Sheffield Hallam University. Anthony d'Offay Gallery (1965-2001) In 1965, at the age of 25, he opened his first gallery in London and for 15 years organised mostly historical exhibitions of early 20th century British art including Abstract Art in England 1913-1915 (1969) which critically reassessed the importance of the Vorticist movement in the UK. In the 1970s, he started to show contemporary art. In 1980 he opened an exhibition space for contemporary art on the first floor at 23 Dering Street. The gallery was run by Anthony d'Offay with Anne Seymour, formerly a curator at Tate, and Marie-Louise Laband who masterminded every aspect of the gallery including the exhibition programme. Together they inaugurated a programme of international contemporary art, starting with an exhibition by Joseph Beuys in August of that year. Beuys' large installation from that show Stripes from the House of the Shaman was sold to the National Museum of Australia, Canberra. The gallery also organised and funded events, publications, performances and lectures. The last exhibition at the Anthony d'Offay Gallery, of Bill Viola, had 70,000 visitors. Artist Rooms d'Offay closed the gallery in 2001 and worked on building a collection of over 1000 artworks. The collection, then valued in excess of £100 million, was donated jointly to the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate in 2008 with the assistance of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, The Art Fund and the Scottish and British Governments. Since 2009 there have been more than 120 Artist Rooms exhibitions in museums and galleries across the United Kingdom. These free shows have been seen by some 29 million visitors. 55,000 young people are in Artist Rooms education programmes and a 10-fold surge in attendance has been recorded at many venues participating in the programme. 93% of visitors said that the experience of Artist Rooms had changed their ideas about art. The Art Fund charity was one of the original principal supporters of Artist Rooms. It continues to sponsor the Touring Programme of exhibitions from the collection and facilitates dynamic education projects in each venue. Allegations of inappropriate behaviour In January 2018, several women with careers in the art world and who have worked with d'Offay, came forward with allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour, with police investigating d'Offay after receiving a complaint from a young woman that he sent her malicious messages. The allegations date from 1997 to 2004 with the current police investigation relating to the period from 2012 to 2018. D'Offay strongly denies the allegations and says he is unaware of a police investigation. Women level claims of sexual harassment against top UK art dealer The Guardian, 13 January 2018.

The railroad was conceived by local farmers and commercial interests in the early twentieth century as part of a plan to provide rail access to the small town of Mound City, South Dakota. The 70-mile projected route of the railway extended eastward from Mound City to the town of Leola, South Dakota, where a connection could be made with the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway. A competitive connection was planned, along the line at Eureka, South Dakota, with the Chicago,_Milwaukee,_St._Paul_and_Pacific_Railroad. Work on the Mound City & Eastern began in 1929, when 18 miles of trackage were completed running northwest from Leola to the new townsite of Long Lake. Financial difficulties ended work at Long Lake, however, and the remainder of the line was never built. Initially, the company operated conventional trains pulled by steam locomotives, but by the 1930s limited financial resources and a lack of traffic forced the railroad to resort to \\"a curious gasoline engine contraption capable of dragging five or six cars over spindly former interurban rail, making two or three trips a week except in winter, when the road frequently shut down.\\"Hofsommer, Don L.

The Second Malaysia Plan (Malay: Rancangan Malaysia Kedua) was an economic development plan introduced by the government of Malaysia with the goal of implementing the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP). It lasted from 1971 to 1975 and aimed to \\"restructure\\" the society of Malaysia and reduce Malaysian Chinese and foreign dominance in the economy of Malaysia so as to improve the economic position of the Malays.Shuid, Mahdi & Yunus, Mohd. Fauzi (2001). Malaysian Studies, p. 85. Longman. . It was the successor to the First Malaysia Plan, which was also intended to specifically tackle the problem of poverty among the Malays. However, the First Malaysia Plan had limited success, which may have been a factor in the 13 May Incident in 1969 when race riots broke out in Kuala Lumpur. The Second Malaysia Plan had been regarded as excessive in its zeal to increase Malay participation in the economy, and the government accordingly scaled back the emphasis on restructuring the economy when the plan ended.  Background  Although the Malays have nearly always comprised a majority of the Malaysian population, their economic power has rarely been commensurate. In 1970, the Bumiputra controlled only 1.9% of the Malaysian economy, while the non-Malays (mostly Chinese) held 37.4%, with the rest in foreign hands.Henderson, John William, Vreeland, Nena, Dana, Glenn B., Hurwitz, Geoffrey B., Just, Peter, Moeller, Philip W. & Shinn, R.S. (1977). Area Handbook for Malaysia, p. 323. American University, Washington D.C., Foreign Area Studies. LCCN 771294. Due to this wide disparity, Article 153 of the Constitution requires the government to set quotas for the dispensation of scholarships, employment in the civil service, etc. targeted at improving the economic status of the Malays. However, the First Malaysia Plan—whose approach had been dependent on the Malays \\"availing themselves of these facilities and services and putting them to good use\\"—failed in addressing the economic imbalance.Henderson, et al., pp. 147–149, 322. Its policies also resulted in discontent among the non-Malays, who mostly supported the opposition parties that favoured reducing or eliminating affirmative action for the Bumiputra in the 1969 general election. A victory parade held on 12 May 1969 by supporters of the opposition led to a retaliatory rally on 13 May by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), a major party in the governing Alliance coalition. However, the rally soon turned into a riot which lasted two days, an incident later known as the 13 May Incident. Officially, around 200 people died—although others have given much larger estimates—with thousands left homeless, the majority of them Chinese. A state of emergency was declared, and Parliament was suspended. The National Operations Council (NOC) governed until 1971, when Parliament reconvened.Means, Gordon P. (1991). Malaysian Politics: The Second Generation, pp. 7–9. Oxford University Press. . The Second Malayan Five Year Plan (1961–1965) was an economic development plan launched by the government of Malaya, and continued by the government of Malaysia (a new nation comprising Malaya, Singapore, Sabah and Sarawak). This plan followed the First Malayan Five Year Plan, which ran from 1956 to 1960. The Second Malayan Five Year Plan increased expenditure for the development of agriculture and rural areas. Funding was markedly increased for land development schemes, physical infrastructure, and social services. The Plan's stated objective was \\"to provide facilities and opportunities for the rural population to improve its level of economic and social wellbeing.\\" Some have attributed the greater expenditure of the Plan to the governing Alliance political coalition's political woes; the coalition had only narrowly won the 1959 general elections due to discontent among the rural Malay electorate over the lack of economic progress.Henderson, John William, Vreeland, Nena, Dana, Glenn B., Hurwitz, Geoffrey B., Just, Peter, Moeller, Philip W. & Shinn, R.S. (1977). Area Handbook for Malaysia, p. 293. American University, Washington D.C., Foreign Area Studies. LCCN 771294. While it held the reins of power, the NOC set out the NEP, with the ultimate aim of eradicating poverty and eliminating \\"the identification of race with economic function\\" through a \\"rapidly expanding economy\\"; the NEP aimed for a Bumiputra share of 30% of the economy within 20 years.Means, p. 24. The Outline Perspective Plan was also approved, with similar goals to the NEP. Both the NEP and the Outline Perspective Plan were set to expire in 1990, and the Second Malaysia Plan was passed by Parliament to implement the goals of these policies.Henderson, et al., p. 294.  Economic restructuring  The Second Malaysia Plan stepped up government involvement in the economy, with the main goal of increasing Malay economic interests, especially in the areas of manufacturing and mining.Henderson, et al., p. 324. To avoid directly hurting Chinese economic interests, the plan focused on huge economic growth, with the goal of expanding both the Malay and non-Malay shares of the economy in absolute terms, while increasing the Malay share in relative terms as well.Henderson, et al., p. 6. A sum of M$7.25 billion in total was allocated for the Second Malaysia Plan. Although this constituted a decrease from the First Malaysia Plan's allocation of M$10.5 billion, the Second Malaysia Plan hoped to achieve greater reduction in poverty and increase the involvement of the Malays in the private sector by imposing certain restrictions on private firms that would benefit Malay employment and economic ownership.Shuid & Yunus, p. 86, 87. At the time the plan was announced, the non-Malays had, in the words of one commentator, \\"a virtual monopoly of private industrial and commercial employment\\", and were concentrated in the urban areas. However, foreign interests controlled most modern industries, including manufacturing, banking, finance, rubber, and tin. The Malays were largely involved in rural occupations such as rice farming, fishing, tending to rubber or oil palm smallholdings, and so on. They were conspicuously absent from even minor white collar jobs, such as clerical work, and only in the civil service, where they were guaranteed 80% of all government jobs, were they present in the upper portion of the hierarchy. Most members of some professions, such as medicine and law, were non-Malay. Ironically, government policies, such as those set out by Article 153, appeared to hinder Malay involvement in the private sector by giving them preference in only the public sector. Unemployment among all races was also rampant, largely due to poor education, with about 70% of the 275,000 unemployed in 1970 being aged between 15 and 25 years. It was all this that the NEP and the Second Malaysia Plan set out to change.Henderson, et al., pp. 37, 90–92.  Industrialisation  Several government agencies that had been established prior to the advent of the Second Malaysia Plan increased their participation in the economy during the Second Malaysia Plan. These agencies included the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority (MIDA) and Majlis Amanah Rakyat (MARA). Several more were also established under the plan, including the Perbadanan Nasional (PERNAS, or the National Trading Corporation), State Economic Development Corporation and the Urban Development Authority (UDA).Henderson, et al., p. 322. At the beginning of the Second Malaysia Plan, the private sector employed mostly Malaysian Chinese; however, they had no real ownership stake in modern industries. PERNAS was established to purchase businesses and participate in joint ventures with private companies, as well as to develop nascent industries to be held in trust until the Malays held sufficient capital to take them over. By the end of the plan's tenure, PERNAS owned 100% of eight companies involved in insurance, trading, construction, properties, engineering, securities, and mining. Joint ventures had also been formed with the private sector to develop the mining, containerisation, tourism and consulting industries. Parliament passed the Industrial Coordination Act during the Second Malaysia Plan, which required all new manufacturing enterprises with M$100,000, or twenty-five or more workers, to be licensed by the Minister of Trade and Industry. To obtain such a licence, each firm had to meet certain conditions set by the Ministry, which could vary. Malaysian Chinese manufacturers were concerned about the act, as they had operated with minimal control from the government before. Nevertheless, the government stated the act was not meant to be detrimental towards any group, and went ahead with its implementation. Under the act, firms were divided into three categories: firms approved after 1 January 1972, firms approved before then, and firms operating without approval from the Ministry. All firms subject to the act were required to submit a proposal to the Ministry stating how they planned to achieve the long-term target of achieving 30% Malay and 70% non-Malay Malaysian ownership in the company. Proposals that were accepted then became the guidelines for how the relevant company would operate.Henderson, et al., pp. 323, 325. Until the Second Malaysia Plan, industry was concentrated on the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The plan thus moved to establish new industrial estates on the east coast, in order to curb rural-urban migration—the east coast was considerably less urbanised than the west coast.Henderson, et al., p. 325. By 1975, manufacturing activities constituted 16% of the Malaysian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), one per cent short of the target of the Second Malaysia Plan. Manufacturing grew negligibly in 1975, attributed by the government to the global recession that year. This contrasted with the 15% growth achieved in 1974, which well exceeded the target of 12.5% growth per year during the Second Malaysia Plan. Food, wood products, and chemical products made up the majority of the manufacturing sector. The substantial growth in manufacturing during this period has been attributed to the government's establishment of free trade zones, where any goods brought in would not be subject to customs duties, and goods could be freely exported abroad or transferred to another free trade zone. In 1974, such zones were declared in the states of Penang, Selangor, and Malacca. The industries located in these zones were mostly electronics-, rubber product- and textile-based.Henderson, et al., pp. 331–332, 339.  Mining  Until the late 1970s, Malaysia was the world's foremost producer of tin, supplying roughly 40% of the non-communist world's tin. Nevertheless, tin reserves were declining; mining's contribution to the GDP was projected to fall 13% over the course of the Second Malaysia Plan, due to the exhaustion of tin and iron reserves. However, bauxite and copper continued to contribute to the mining sector in the early 1970s. Malay participation in the mining sector was minimal, and as much as 70% of the industry remained under foreign control.Henderson, et al., pp. 325, 327. This was a legacy of the British colonial era; many British firms, which had arrived in the 19th century to exploit Malaysian mineral resources, had not departed yet. Malay participation in the mining sector—especially in tin—was further hampered by the British tendency in the 19th century to bring in cheap Chinese labour; most of those employed in mining were still Chinese as late as 1970.Mispari, Masariah binti, Abdul Wahab, Johara binti & Hasan, Ridzuan bin (2003). Sejarah Tingkatan 2, pp. 141, 142. Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka. . Petroleum or crude oil began to significantly contribute to the Malaysian economy in the 1970s, as new oil rigs and refineries were set up. By 1975, total production of crude oil stood at , most of it produced by Shell. In 1974, the exclusive right to own, explore and exploit petroleum in Malaysia was vested in the government enterprise of Petronas. The following year, Petronas was granted sole rights over the marketing and distribution of all petroleum products and a provision to control other companies without taking an ownership stake in them, through the issuance of management shares to Petronas.Henderson, et al., pp. 329, 331. The number of Malays employed in the mining sector soared from 1970 onwards, as the government's restructuring policies came into force. When the Second Malaysia Plan began, less than 200,000 Malays were employed in the mining industry. By 1990, they numbered nearly a million, well ahead of the target numbers originally outlined.Snodgrass, Donald R. (1991). \\"Successful Economic Development in a Multi-Ethnic Society: The Malaysian Case\\" . Retrieved 17 February 2006. Licences for mining operations were specially reserved for Malays as part of the drive to increase their ownership level in the mining industry.Heng, Pek Koon (1997). \\"The New Economic Policy and the Chinese Community in Peninsular Malaysia\\" . The Developing Economies XXXV-3: 262–292. Retrieved 21 December 2011. The government also ostensibly increased Bumiputra ownership by nationalising several formerly foreign mining companies—by 1989, state corporations controlled 60% of the mining industry.Aslam, Mohamed & Hassan, Asan Ali Golam (2003). \\"Development Planning and Regional Imbalances in Malaysia\\". Retrieved 17 February 2006. The government was also aided by the fact that petroleum soon eclipsed other minerals in the mining sector—as Petronas was a state-owned corporation, it was also considered a Bumiputra enterprise. However, the government has been criticised for this practice, as it is argued nationalised corporations belong to the public at large, and not only to the Bumiputra.Kamarudin, Raja Petra (22 March 2005). \\"The need for a marriage counsellor\\". Malaysia Today.  Agriculture  The Second Malaysia Plan continued the initiatives that previous five year plans, such as the First Malayan Five Year Plan, had taken. Although expenditure on other development increased substantially, by about M$1 million, funding for rural development was also increased. The Second Malaysia Plan focused on diversifying crops grown in Malaysia; the 1974 Green Book Program aimed to make Malaysia self-sufficient in food production by encouraging farmers to grow vegetables, such as long beans, chilies, etc., and rear livestock—the Veterinary Department going as far as to distribute cattle. Fertilisers, seedlings, insecticides and herbicides were subsidised. Double-cropping of rice was encouraged, so farmers could harvest twice in one year and effectively double their output.Kamil, Nik Fuad, Alwi, Syed Abdillah & Singh, Mukhtiar (1996). \\"MALAYSIA\\".

The Farmers' Organization Authority was established in 1973 with the goal of co-ordinating agricultural cooperatives, farmers' associations, and government agricultural agencies.Henderson, et al., pp. 307, 308. Growth in small-scale agriculture was viewed as crucial to creating jobs and reducing rural poverty, and government agencies such as FELDA (the Federal Land Development Authority) vastly increased the scope and size of their development programs. RISDA (Rubber Industries Smallholder Development Agency) was given the task of diversifying smallholder estates; RISDA set itself the ambitious goal of developing during the Second Malaysia Plan. The main aim was to diversify into palm oil through the planting of oil palms. The Malaysian economy relied heavily on rubber at the time—at its peak, Malaya (Peninsular Malaysia) alone produced more than half of the world's rubber. However, the Great Depression, which depressed rubber prices, greatly set back the Malayan economy. The Malaysian government thus aimed to avert another incident by diversifying the agriculture sector. However, RISDA over-reached itself in attempting to so quickly reappropriate land; by the end of the Second Malaysia Plan, only had been developed, with only half this number comprising oil palm estates.Henderson, et al., p. 309, 311.Mispari, Abdul Wahab & Hasan, p. 131, 133. The land development and resettlement policies instituted by the government, however, failed to make an impact on rural poverty. The government managed to resettle only 40,000 people, despite an estimated 535,000 families engaged in agriculture living below the poverty level. Due to inefficiencies in the program, the beneficiaries of resettlement and development were not always those with the greatest need. It was also alleged by some that there had been too much emphasis on the difficult process of resettlement and development of new areas, instead of increasing productivity in existing farms. Matters were complicated by the Constitution, which gave the states much control over land development, and thus requiring the federal government to negotiate with individual state governments. Non-Malay rural families also did not benefit much due to this, as the Constitution reserved portions of land for the Malays, and state governments were not anxious to receive destitute non-Malays.Henderson, et al., pp. 311–312. Although the Second Malaysia Plan greatly modernised the \\"rice bowl\\" states of Kedah and Perlis—virtually eliminating the water buffalo by replacing it with tractors—most smallholders and individual farmers did not benefit technology- wise. In the corporate agriculture sector, the Malays held only a 0.3% stake, as opposed to 70.8% held by foreign interests. In the noncorporate sector, the Malays held 47.1%. Due to limited capital, many Malays were still engaged in \\"lower productivity activities\\" as the Second Malaysia Plan ended.Henderson, et al., p. 313.  Health  The Second Malaysia Plan continued past initiatives in raising nutritional levels through a number of programs. These included incentives to grow nutritious food, instruction in nutrition and menu planning, and provision of food for groups with the highest rates of malnutrition. However, these programs were hindered by a lack of trained medical personnel.Henderson, et al., p. 36. Although family planning was established as a national goal in 1964, efforts during the Second Malaysia Plan to promote it were hampered by government neglect. Much of the success achieved by the National Family Planning Board occurred during the years of the First Malaysia Plan (1966–1970). The Second Malaysia Plan hoped to add 600,000 new users of family planning techniques, but the facilities and personnel provided were inadequate. The topic was viewed as rather sensitive by the government, and thus family planning was mostly ignored.Henderson, et al., p. 35, 36. Ironically, in 1984 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad effectively eliminated family planning as a government policy by announcing the National Population Policy, which targeted a 70 million population by 2100—up from 12.6 million in 1984.Chin, Christine B.N. (1998). \\"In Service and Servitude\\". Retrieved 15 February 2006.  Education  Although education was mostly sidelined in favour of socioeconomic restructuring programs during the Second Malaysia Plan, some important initiatives were taken during its tenure.Henderson, et al., p. 165. In 1970, Malay, the national language, became the major medium of instruction from primary to tertiary level, replacing English. British standardised examinations were replaced with local ones, and new Malay-language textbooks were introduced. By the end of the plan, most formerly English-based schools had converted the first four years of instruction entirely to the new Malay- medium curriculum.Henderson, et al., p. 171. In 1973, the Curriculum Development Centre was established. Its goal was to co-ordinate projects to reform the curriculum that had previously been handled by varying government departments. It also began revamping the curriculum for science and mathematics, and began a new program to review the various social science curricula.Henderson, et al., p. 170. The Second Malaysia Plan also hoped to increase the availability of vocational and technical training. Despite some attempts, little progress was made in improving the curriculum, which focused on providing a general education and made little room for vocational or technical training. Several new technical and vocational schools were built under the Second Malaysia Plan, with seven institutions alone completed in 1975. It was hoped this would alleviate the problem of unemployment, especially among the youth.Henderson, et al., pp. 169–170, 174.  Transportation  The Second Malaysia Plan aimed to modernise Malaysian railroads, which the government regarded as crucial to development and industry. All trains were converted to use the more efficient diesel fuel, and the government increased allocations for maintenance and modernisation of the rail infrastructure. In particular, emphasis was placed on upgrading existing rolling stock, roadbeds, and repair facilities.Henderson, et al., p. 29. Air service was expanded under the plan, which paid for the purchase of all- weather and night traffic control equipment, as well as the training of staff to handle the equipment. The Second Malaysia Plan also saw Malaysia-Singapore Airlines split into the Malaysia Airline System (MAS) and Singapore Airlines (SIA).Henderson, et al., pp. 29–30. The Second Malaysia Plan also saw the introduction of containerisation in Malaysia to better facilitate transportation. The plan called for the establishment of a national haulage company to handle inland transport; in August 1971, Kontena Nasional Berhad (National Containers Limited) was established by the government. In December, M.V. Benavon became the first container vessel to dock in Malaysia, at the North Terminal of Port Klang in Selangor.Tengku Mahmud Shah Al-haj, Tengku Jamaluddin Bin (2003). \\"Liberalization of the Container Haulage Industry in Malaysia\\" . Retrieved 17 February 2006. At the time of the Second Malaysia Plan, there were only two sea ports in Malaysia; one in Penang, and one in Klang. The plan called for the construction of two new ports, both in peninsular Malaysia; one would be in Johor, and another would be in Kuantan, a major town in Pahang. The two main objectives of these projects were to meet increasing demand for sea transportation of freight, and to bring development to underdeveloped states. Johor Port was completed in 1977, while Kuantan Port began full operations in 1984.Bajpai, Nirupam & Shastri, Vanita (1999). \\"Port Development in Tamil Nadu: Lessons from Chinese Provinces\\" . Retrieved 17 February 2006.  Legacy  At the end of the Second Malaysia Plan, the poverty rate was found to have declined from 49% to 43%. Unemployment improved slightly, decreasing from 7.5% to 7.4%. Great strides were made in increasing Bumiputra involvement in the private sector, however; the employment rate of Bumiputra in the manufacturing sector increased from 29% to 33%, and from 24% to 34% in the commercial sector. Bumiputra equity ownership more than doubled from 3% to 7.8%. However, this was considered unsatisfactory by many, especially as much of the progress had been made by government enterprises holding the equity in trust.Henderson, et al., pp. 295–296. Although the plan had initially targeted a GDP growth rate of 12.5% a year, only an average of 11% was managed. The growth was extremely uneven; while in 1973 GDP grew by 27%, in 1975, it grew a paltry 3% due to the global recession at the time.Henderson, et al., p. 285. Despite the government's efforts to tackle unemployment, creating 600,000 new jobs during the Second Malaysia Plan, the number of unemployed actually increased between 1970 and 1975; in 1970, there were 275,000 unemployed, but by 1975, the number stood at 324,000.Henderson, et al., p. 37. The Second Malaysia Plan was also forced to confront an unexpected problem: inflation. Between 1972 and 1975, the consumer price index (CPI) unexpectedly increased by 40%. In 1974, the inflation rate averaged 18%, although it was reduced to 7% by 1975.Henderson, et al., p. 150. This new conundrum was therefore considered by the government when it set out the Third Malaysia Plan (1976–1980). Another overarching consequence of the Second Malaysia Plan was its efforts in crop diversification. Despite RISDA failing to meet its targets, the palm oil industry in Malaysia continued to grow. By 1998, palm oil was the second-largest contributor towards Malaysia's GDP, second only to electronics products.\\"Crude Palm Oil Futures\\". Retrieved 16 February 2015. Overall, the Second Malaysia Plan made much more substantial progress towards reducing the inequity in the economy than its predecessor had. However, the emphasis on improving the lot of the Malays greatly worried the non-Malays, and when the Third Malaysia Plan was launched, the government toned down its rhetoric on affirmative action and emphasised greater economic growth, which would benefit all.

History  Charlottesville High School was founded by John Cunningham in 1904 and was built in 1974 because the Lane High School building had become too small to accommodate all students within the city limits. Lane High school saw its last graduating class in June, 1974. CHS opened its doors in September, 1974. The new school inherited their school colors (black & orange) as well as their mascot (the Black Knight) from the former high school. Lane High School was never demolished and is now the Albemarle County office building. Charlottesville High School's sports complex was still located on the grounds of the Lane High School building until the 1980s, when it was moved to a site across the street from CHS. During the last 20 years of the 20th century, CHS has had some major additions including a new gym facility and a large auditorium. Renovations started in 2004, lasting two years, and included a fresh coat of paint, updated class rooms, larger and modern restroom facilities, updated ventilation systems, new lockers, and new, asbestos-free floor tile.  Athletics  CHS has many athletic programs, ranging from football to tennis, track and field to field hockey. Recent highlights include soccer (boys') winning a state championship in 2004. Charlottesville high school boys soccer won the state championships in 2019  Performing arts  In 1984, the 1,276-seat Performing Arts Center of Charlottesville (PAC) was built to address both the shortage of auditorium space for the high school as well as the area's need for a large venue to accommodate professional touring performances, such as the Richmond Symphony Orchestra, Russian Ballet, and the Charlottesville performance of A Prairie Home Companion. In the fall of 2005, Charlottesville City Council decided to rechristen the Performing Arts Center of Charlottesville as \\"The Martin Luther King Jr. Performing Arts Center of Charlottesville\\" (MLK PAC), in order to honor the civil rights activist. Sixty dates during the school year are reserved for school-sponsored events such as assemblies and the school's performing arts program.

It is the largest producer of ice cream in Europe by volume, and the second-largest in the world, after Unilever. Froneri was established in 2016 as a joint venture between Nestlé and PAI Partners to combine the two companies' ice cream activities. PAI Partners had previously acquired R&R; Ice Cream in 2013. R&R; was originally founded as Richmond Ice Cream in 1985. Froneri expanded by initiating consolidation in the European ice cream market. It then took control over Nestlé's USA's ice cream division in 2020. The company has a turnover of £750 million, and employs 3,000 people. The main production site is located at Leeming Bar, and employs 665 people in the largest ice cream factory in Europe. Smaller production sites are located in Leeds and Bodmin, Cornwall. History The company was founded as Richmond Ice Cream in 1985, when Bedale farmer Jonathan Ropner acquired Cardosi, a Thornaby ice cream manufacturer. Cardosi had £40,000 of ice cream manufacturing equipment, and had offered itself up for sale. Ropner asked his friend, James Lambert to run the company. Lambert claimed that the pair knew \\"nothing\\" about ice cream manufacturing. The company initially had just five employees. In 1987, the company's first major success occurred when it won a contract to manufacture own-label ice cream for supermarket chain Morrisons, which had 44 stores at the time. The company acquired Windsor Creameries from Trevor Hemmings in 1994. In return, Hemmings gained a 40% stake in Richmond. In 1997, Richmond completed a reverse takeover of the publicly listed ice lolly manufacturer Treats Group, based in Leeds, which gave them the Crossgates site and far greater leverage in negotiations with supermarkets. The deal meant that the newly formed entity was publicly listed. Allied Frozen Foods was acquired from Associated British Foods in 2000. It acquired Nestle's loss-making UK ice cream business, Lyons Maid, including FAB, in 2001. On 5 May 2006, Richmond Foods announced that it was to be taken over by Oaktree Capital Management, which merged the company with Roncadin, founded by Regina Roncadin, the largest German own-brand label ice cream manufacturer, to make the largest ice cream manufacturer in Europe. The company was then known as R&R; Ice Cream. In 2008, it acquired Cornish ice cream producer Kelly's, followed by French business Rolland in 2010. R&R; acquired Frederick's Dairies for £49 million in April 2013. It thus acquired control of the licenses for producing Cadbury, Del Monte and Britvic branded ice cream. In August 2012, the company acquired Eskigel (for £60.5 million), an Italian ice cream manufacturer whose factory is located in Terni (Umbria), about 65 miles north of Rome. In April 2013, R&R; was acquired by the French private equity firm PAI Partners for £715 million. As a result, James Lambert moved from the chief executive role to chairman. In October 2013, R&R;'s founder was named entrepreneur of the year at EY's annual awards hosted by Jeremy Vine. Lambert will now go on to compete globally with more than 60 other country winners at the EY World Entrepreneur Of The Year awards in Monte Carlo next year. In 2016, Nestlé and PAI Partners agreed to set up a joint venture known as Froneri which combined the two companies' ice cream activities throughout Europe and other international countries. On 11 December, 2019, Froneri announced that it will expand into the lucrative North American market with the acquisition of Nestle USA's ice cream division for $4 billion USD which includes iconic brands such as Dreyer's, Häagen-Dazs and Drumstick. The acquisition completed in Q1 2020. Operations The company manufactures over 600 million ice lollies every year, produces and packages over 70% of 2-litre supermarket own-brand ice cream, including for major UK supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda, and employs around 665 people at its Leeming Bar plant.BBC Look North 15 August 2011 The Leeds Crossgates manufacturing site, which employs 135 people, is scheduled to close at the end of 2013. The company stated that the site would have needed considerable investment to remain viable. All existing staff were offered positions at Leeming Bar. The Bodmin site employs 30 people.

Q. Bachmann, was a German physician and botanist who helped to develop better ways of classifying plants. Life and work \\"Horminum tingitanum\\" (Salvia tingitana) from Ordo Plantarum 1690Rivinus was born in Leipzig, Germany, and studied at the University of Leipzig (1669-1671), continued his studies in the University of Helmstedt (where he received M.D. in 1676). In 1677, he started lecturing in medicine at the University of Leipzig, in 1691 appointed to two chairs, that of physiology and of botany, and made the curator of the University medical garden. In 1701, he became professor of pathology, in 1719, professor of therapeutics and permanent dean of the Faculty of Medicine. The same year he became a Fellow of the Royal Society. Because of his interest also in astronomy, by the last decade of his life (around 1713), Rivinus was nearly completely blind from looking at sunspots. He died in Leipzig. In his Introductio generalis in rem herbariam and three books on the plant orders (which comprised but a small part of the whole projected work on a methodical description of plants), Rivinus introduced several important innovations which were later used by other botanists (Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and Carl Linnaeus among them). He classified the plants according to the structure of the flower. Like John Ray he extensively used dichotomous keys which led first to the higher groups, which he called higher genera (genus summum) of plant orders (ordo), and then to the lower genera. Along with Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, Rivinus was the first to apply consistently the rule that the names of all species in a genus should start with the same word (generic name). If a genus contained just one species, the generic name would be its only name. If there were more than one species in the genus, their names should consist of the generic name followed by differentia specifica (a brief diagnostic phrase). His nomenclature differed from de Tournefort's in not using a diagnostic phrase with the first plant of a genus, adding differentiae only to the second and subsequent plant species. He corresponded with John Ray on matters of plant classification. Principal works *Introductio generalis in rem herbariam. Lipsiae Leipzig: Typis Christoph. Güntheri, 1690. [8] + 39 p.

Greenstein (January 2, 1893 – October 8, 1977), better known as The Mighty Atom, was a 20th-century strongman. Early life Greenstein was born to a Jewish family in Suwałki, Poland, in 1893. As a child he suffered from respiratory ailments, and at age 14, a team of doctors predicted he would die from tuberculosis. Around that time, he became acquainted with a Russian circus strongman, Champion Volanko, who mentored Greenstein. Greenstein traveled with Volanko and the Issakoff Brothers Circus for eighteen months, learning the strongman's training regimen. After this, he returned to Poland and married his wife, Leah. Career He began his career as a wrestler. However, due in part to rising anti-Semitism in Eastern Europe, he then left for the United States. He first went to Galveston, Texas, working as a dockworker and oil field worker. He also wrestled professionally at this time as Kid Greenstein. In 1914, The Houston Daily Post reported that a friend of Greenstein accidentally shot him in the middle of the forehead. The report states the bullet did not enter his skull, and \\"flattened out against his forehead\\". This experience sparked Greenstein's interest in the mental powers associated with strength, and he gradually developed an array of strongman feats. He was featured five times in Ripley's Believe It Or Not and in the 1976 Guinness Book of World Records. Two of Greenstein's feats included biting through an iron nail and bending iron horseshoes by hand. An iron nail and iron horseshoes are on display at the Weightlifting Hall of Fame in York, Pennsylvania. Later in life, Greenstein sold coconut oil soaps and health elixirs at fairs and farmers' markets. He traveled in an old Model A truck with panels that opened to show his extensive collection of newsclippings and citations from civic leaders and organizations. New York City Mayor LaGuardia issued a proclamation, thanking Greenstein for showing his skills to the city's police department. Greenstein had volunteered to teach jujutsu techniques to members of the New York City auxiliary police during World War II. It was many years before the technique was known to most Americans. Greenstein continued performing his strongman feats well into his eighties, giving his last performance at his great-grandchild's first birthday on May 11, 1977, at Madison Square Garden at the age of 84. He dazzled the audience by bending horseshoes and driving spikes through metal with the palm of his hand. Personal life and demise Joe and Leah Greenstein had ten children. Greenstein succumbed to cancer on October 8, 1977, at age 84. Legacy The story of his life has been told by Ed Spielman in the book The Mighty Atom and the documentary film \\"The Mighty Atom\\". He may be the inspiration for the fictional character of Al Pratt, a costumed crime-fighter who went by the alias of The Atom. Joe Greenstein's life and career are also the subject of the 2017 documentary The Mighty Atom. Joe's 93-year-old son Mike Greenstein appeared on America's Got Talent in 2014 and successfully pulled a car with his teeth.

Located east of Edmonton, in east-central Alberta, the boundaries of the block settlement include all or part of multiple municipal districts, within census divisions numbers 12 and 10.  Background  A block settlement is a type of rural ethnic enclave found throughout Western Canada. The founding of this block settlement in 1891 marked the beginning of large-scale Ukrainian immigration to Canada. The region has been described at being as important to Ukrainian Canadian culture as Acadiana is to the Cajuns of Louisiana.  Founding and development  sorochka vyshyvanka (embroidered blouse) and a home-woven skirt. The khata (cottage) is made in the vernacular style of notched logs and has a thatched roof. Native of Nebyliv (near Kalush) Wasyl Eleniak, while employed in the lumbering industry driving rafts down Limnytsia, heard tales from some local German colonists (West Ukraine was part of Austria-Hungary as the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria) whose relatives in Canada \\"received 160 acres for nothing\\".THEHISTORY OF UKRAINIANS IN CANADA. TUGG. The Eleniak's parents owned only 3 morgens of land and decided to check the rumors and emigrate to Canada. The colony was founded by a group of Ukrainian settlers led by Iwan Pylypow in 1891 (although he himself did not settle permanently until the next year). Pylypow's first farm was near the present-day village of Star, Alberta, then called Edna, and the name Edna- Star was applied to the whole area retrospectively. Most of the first settlers were from Pylypow's home village of Nebyliv and the area was sometimes called the Nebyliv colony in their honour, although later settlers were from other areas of Austrian-controlled Ukraine, namely the provinces of Galicia and Bukovyna. The location of the new settlement was chosen partly because of the existing Galician German settlement nearby at Josephburg. Ukrainians in Galicia were used to working with their German neighbours in the \\"Old Country\\" and many could speak some German. For new settlers, having a place to earn cash wages until their farm became productive was also extremely important, and the Germans were the logical place to turn. Another prime concern of the settlers was timber. This part of Alberta is part of the aspen parkland biome, a relatively heavily wooded area compared to the prairies further to the south. To the surprise (and sometimes consternation) of Canadian authorities, the Ukrainians were willing to sacrifice time and effort to clear the land, and would even take lands of poor soil quality in order to secure treed land. This was because there was a severe wood shortage in Austrian Ukraine, and peasants became reliant on the pan (landlord) for the precious commodity, used in making all manner of tools and buildings. In Canada one could receive of forested (or prairie) land for free under the Dominion Lands Act. By 1914 the zone of Ukrainian settlement stretched for from Edna-Star in the west to Slawa in the east and approximately from Smoky Lake in the north to the outskirts of Mundare and Vegreville in the south. Many of the non-Ukrainian immigrants to the area, also came from the Austrian crownlands of Galicia and Bukovina where the Ukrainians originated. These included Poles, Romanians, Germans, and Jews.  Recent demographics  Today the area known as the Kalyna Country ecomuseum, which preserves and showcases Ukrainian Canadian culture. It is also home to the Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Village which contains pioneer buildings from all across the area. At one time within the boundaries of the settlement block, up to 80% of the population was of Ukrainian origin. However, internal migration within Canada has changed the patterns. As well, since Statistics Canada has allowed people to claim \\"Canadian\\" as an ethnic origin only since 2001, figures are not comparable before and after that date. According to the 2006 Census, in Alberta census division 10 there were 6,700 people who claimed to be single-origin Ukrainian (the largest of any ethnic group, excluding \\"Canadian\\") and 17,130 people who claimed some Ukrainian origin out of a total population of 85,155, giving approximately 20% of the population. In Division 12 there were 3,575 who claimed to be Ukrainian single-origin and 11,220 total claiming some Ukrainian origin out of 59,305, for around 19% of the population. Ethnic origin statistics are not available for many of the municipalities with the most concentrated Ukrainian populations, because Statistics Canada does not publish this information for communities with a total population of less than 5,000 for privacy reasons. Rural-to-urban migration has reduced the populations of Lamont County, Thorhild County, the County of Two Hills No. 21, and the County of Minburn No. 27 below this threshold. The counties for which there are statistics that have the highest proportions of total respondents claiming some Ukrainian origin are the County of St. Paul No. 19 (26%), Sturgeon County (18%), Beaver County (16%), the Municipal District of Bonnyville No. 87 (17%), and the County of Vermilion River (16%).http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/highlights/ethnic/SelectGeo.cfm?Lang=E&Geo;=CSD&PRCode;=48&Table;=2 Other than Ukrainians, the largest responses in this area are French (especially near Bonnyville and St. Paul), German (especially near Josephburg), Native Indian, and Metis, with smaller number of English, Scottish, and Irish, and some Romanian, Polish, Russian, Jewish, and Norwegian. In the three largest towns in the region the percentage of the population claiming some Ukrainian origin were: Vegreville 44%, (5,720) St. Paul, 31%, and Bonnyville, 18%. Other towns and villages thought to have large Ukrainian populations include Myrnam, Willingdon, Lamont, Mundare, Andrew, Chipman, plus numerous hamlets and rural communities.

It covers and, in March 2006, housed 4,850 animals representing 840 species.  History  Initially, the zoo was located in the park of the former royal palace, with the primary attraction being a Eurasian black vulture caught in Bulgaria and exhibited in a cage in the garden. Later, pheasants and deer were added to the collection, but since the exhibits and facilities of the time proved inadequate to accommodate a pair of brown bears, Tsar Ferdinand of Bulgaria ordered a grant of land to be awarded to Sofia Zoo on the grounds of the former botanical garden, then in the outskirts of the city. Sofia Zoo's exhibition of animals constantly increased, with both local and foreign species being added, most notably a pair of lions in 1892, which were housed in a former stable and a lion cub was born the same year. Between 1893 and 1895, new cages and buildings were constructed to accommodate the ever- increasing collection of birds and mammals, including a solid three-room stone building in the back of the terrain designed to be inhabited by bears (1894), a pool where a few pink-backed pelicans lived, a building to accommodate pheasants and another one for eagles (1895). Sofia Zoo moved from its original (and smaller) location in the centre of the city to a new site about south of Sofia in 1982.  Exhibits  ; Grazing animals The zoo has some 80 individuals representing 20 grazing species, including white rhinos, hippopotamus, elephant, zebras, red deer, ibex, wild boar, dromedary camels, and American bison. ; Primates Primates are housed in two pavilions. The zoo has 93 individuals representing 19 species, including ring-tailed lemurs, yellow baboons, common marmoset, and macaques. ; Predators The predator sector houses big cats, bears and small predators, including lions, tigers, leopards, pumas and brown bears. ; Penguins In January 2011 the zoo received eight Humboldt penguins on loan from Germany. The penguins are on loan for about 18 months, after which they will be returned, with any offspring to stay at the zoo. 300px ; Birds The zoo has some 1,400 individual birds representing 192 species. Waterbirds are housed in a lake, and Imperial eagles, Griffon vultures, Egyptian vultures and buzzards in a large walk-through aviary. Other species of birds at the zoo include ostriches, Silver pheasants, peacocks, flamingos, blue-and-yellow macaws, owls, cockatoos and cockatiels.  Other facilities  The zoo's veterinary clinic includes a separate entrance and is accessible to the public without entry to the zoo.  The future  Sofia Zoo is currently in the process of upgrading its facilities to meet current European standards in preparation for becoming a full member of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA).

She was the daughter of John Doukas Komnenos, sometime Byzantine dux in Cyprus, and Maria Taronitissa. Her sister Theodora married Prince Bohemund III of Antioch, and her brother Alexios was briefly, in 1185, a pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire. Life Marriage of Maria Komnene and Amalric I. After the annulment of his first marriage to Agnes of Courtenay, Amalric was anxious to forge an alliance with Byzantium and emperor Manuel I Komnenos, so in 1164/65 he sent ambassadors to Constantinople to ask the hand of an imperial princess but received no answer until August 1167, when they landed at Tyre with Maria Komnene, who was the emperor's grandniece and had had bestowed upon her a rich dowry. The marriage of Amalric and Maria was celebrated with much fanfare at Tyre, on 29 August 1167. They had two children: * A daughter, born in 1171 and died shortly after. * Isabella I of Jerusalem, born in 1172. On his deathbed, in 1174, Amalric left Nablus to Maria, who became dowager queen upon his death. In 1177, Maria married secondly with Balian of Ibelin, who commanded the defense of Jerusalem against Saladin in 1187. She bore him at least four children: * Helvis of Ibelin, who married (1) Reginald of Sidon (widower of Agnes of Courtenay), and (2) Guy of Montfort * John of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut and constable of Jerusalem, who married Helvis of Nephin, then Melisende of Arsur * Margaret, who married (1) Hugh of Tiberias (stepson of Raymond III of Tripoli), and (2) Walter III of Caesarea * Philip of Ibelin, bailli (regent) of Cyprus, who married Alice of Montbéliard. Maria and Balian supported Conrad of Montferrat (uncle of the late King Baldwin V) in his struggle for the crown against Guy of Lusignan. They arranged for Maria's daughter by Amalric, Isabella, to have her first marriage annulled so that she could marry Conrad, giving him a stronger claim to the throne. In this, Maria and Balian gained the enmity of Richard I of England and his chroniclers. The anonymous author of the Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi wrote of them: > Steeped in Greek filth from the cradle, she had a husband whose morals > matched her own: he was cruel, she was godless; he was fickle, she was > pliable; he was faithless, she was fraudulent. As the grandmother of Alice of Champagne (Isabella's daughter by her third husband, Henry II of Champagne), Maria conducted the marriage negotiations with Cyprus in 1208 – Alice was to marry Hugh I of Cyprus. Blanche of Navarre, Regent and Countess of Champagne, widow of Alice's paternal uncle, provided the dowry for Alice. This is the last time Maria is mentioned, and she was certainly dead by 1217.

Models in the 200 designation represented the least expensive Packard model range, on the firm's shortest wheelbase, and least powerful 8-cylinder in-line engine. It replaced the Packard One-Twenty and the Packard One-Ten, and was renamed the Packard Clipper for the 1953 model year. Concurrently, the company also produced the Packard 250, which shared the same basic body and wheelbase as the 200, but was equipped with Packard's larger 8-cylinder in-line engine and stylized with more upscale exterior detailing. The 250 model line consisted of the convertible and the Mayfair hardtop.  Overview  The 1951 Packard 200 and 250 were introduced as Packard's least expensive model range on August 24, 1950, taking the place of the low-line Packard Standard models which were eliminated for the 1951 model year. The 200 debuted as part of the fully redesigned Packard line, attributed to John Reinhart. Replacing the bulbous 1948-1950 Packards in the 22nd and 23rd Packard Series, Reinhart's \\"High Pockets\\" design was more formal than its predecessor, and would serve Packard until the end of the 1956 model year when true Packard production ceased. 1951 Packard 250 convertible 1952 Packard 250 Mayfair hardtop Both the 200 and the 250 were considered \\"junior\\" series cars, and were separated from the Packard 300 and Packard Patrician 400 models by their shorter wheelbases ( versus ) and lesser trim appointments. Packard 200 standard models were available as a four-door sedan, two-door coupé, and a three-passenger business coupé (lacking a rear seat). While similar in appearance to the senior cars, the junior Packard lacked the noted Packard cormorant hood ornament and had vertical tail lights instead of the horizontal units on the senior models. The junior models also lacked the wrap-around rear window feature found on senior Packard sedan models. The 250 model range was introduced in March 1951, and was specially designed to fill the vacuum of Packard having neither a hardtop or convertible in its 1951 model range. Besides their unique body styles, 250's received three jet-louvers on each rear-quarterpanel. Better grade trim and fabric were used within. All Packard 200 models came with twin horns, two sun visors, front and rear bumper guards, spare tire and jack set. Deluxe trim level included the spartan appointments found on the standard models, and added chrome wheel rings, and turn indications as standard. White-wall tires and full-wheel covers were also extra. The straight-eight produces at 3600 rpm with a 7.0:1 compression ratio - Ultramatic-equipped cars received a slightly higher compression ratio of 7.5:1 thanks to which it offered . The 327 V8 was also available as an option on the 200 for $45, considerably less than the cost of a heater/defroster.Kowalke, p. 261 Items which have since become standard to the auto industry since the late 1960s such as heater, radio, tinted glass, carpeting, etc., were all optional on the Packard, as well as other premium cars during that era. Packard also became the first car-maker to offer power-brakes in 1951. “Easamatic” as they were trademarked, were a product of Bendix and an exclusive to Packard. Changes for 1952 were minimal, and centered on the requisite annual trim updates. Packard did drop the Business Coupé, a move that other U.S. automakers were also making at the same time.  Marketing legacy  1952 Packard 250 convertible While Packard's overall sales for 1951 were over 100,000 units, too many of the units sold were low-line models in the 200 and 250 series. Senior Packards – the traditional prewar niche that Packard ruled in the 1920s and 1930s – offered during 1951 and 1952 were only available as two models, the 300 and the Patrician 400, both of which were only available in a single body type, the four-door sedan. Dealers, who were quick to appease their customers, sold Packard 300 and Patrician 400 model trim and applied it to the lesser Packard 200 and 250 models, diluting the Senior Packards of the visual uniqueness that separated them from lesser priced cars. To remedy this, Packard hired James J. Nance, the CEO of Hotpoint to reestablish Packard as an automotive leader. Among Nance’s first moves was to begin building model identity by dropping the numeric model designations and renaming the entire range of models. Nance also saw to it that Senior Packards received broader visual cues and trim to separate themselves from lesser models. Nance also began creating different specialty and show cars in an attempt to create \\"buzz\\" in the automotive press and make Packard look less moribund, like the Packard Pan-American and the Packard Panther. The 200 and 250 models were renamed the Packard Clipper Special and Clipper Deluxe, part of Nance’s plan to ultimately spin the cars off into their own make in 1956 as the Clipper and return the Packard name to a maker of strictly luxury automobiles.  Production statistics  Total Packard production numbers for both years on both models: * 1951, 200 (Standard - all body styles), 24,310 units * 1951, 200 (Deluxe - all body styles), 47,052 units * 1951, 250 (all body styles) 4,640 units (Introduced in March 1951, partial model year tally) * 1952, 200 (Standard - all body styles), 39,720 units * 1952, 200 (Deluxe - all body styles), 7,000 units * 1952, 250 (all body models), 5,201 units  References  ; Inline ; General * 200 Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Coupés Category:Sedans Category:Cars introduced in 1951 ","title":"Packard 200"},{"id":"4422534","title":"FC Lourdes"},{"id":"4422540","title":"Voyager's Return"},{"id":"4422541","text":"Justice Arijit Pasayat is a former judge of the Supreme Court of India.

It was home to the Highland Light Infantry. After the barracks closed in 1960, the site was chosen for the Wyndford housing scheme (the Glaswegian term for housing estate).Wyndford, 1967, Virtual Mitchell The former barrack's walls and gatehouse are still in place, and they form a perimeter around the Wyndford estate.

It was founded by Thomas Lubanga in 2001 and was one of six such groups that sprung up in the mineral-rich Ituri region on the border with Uganda in the Ituri conflict. The UPC supported and was primarily composed of the Hema ethnic group. What began as a struggle for control over land and resources, broke out into ethnic warfare as atrocities increased and as arms from Uganda and Rwanda became available, and units of the Ugandan army became involved. By February 2003, the UPC was said to have fielded an estimated 15,000 soldiers. The UPC carried out numerous attacks upon civilians and other serious human rights abuses in pursuit of its policies. In August 2002, the UPC took control of the town of Bunia with the help of Ugandan forces, following which it received support from Rwanda. In late 2003, the UPC split into several factions: one led by Kisembo Bahemuka and known as the UPC- Kisembo (UPC-K), another under Thomas Lubanga and known as the UPC-Lubanga (UPC-L), and the Parti pour l'unité et la sauvegarde de l'intégrité du Congo (PUSIC) - Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo, formed by Mandro Panga Kahwa. The UPC-L was militarily stronger as most of the militia stayed with Lubanga. After the 2004 accords most of the UPC-K eventually merged into PUSIC. The UPC-L was implicated in the deaths of nine Bangladeshi MONUC peacekeepers on 25 March 2005. Lubanga was arrested along with Floribert Ndjabu, leader of the Nationalist and Integrationist Front. In March 2006, Lubanga was arrested under a warrant issued by the International Criminal Court for the alleged war crime of using child soldiers, and was flown to the Netherlands. Bosco Ntaganda was named its leader in his absence. Human Rights Watch states that between August 2002 and March 2003, the UPC arrested and tortured over 100 opponents, was responsible for the murder of a Kenyan peacekeeper in January 2004 and the kidnapping of a Moroccan peacekeeper later that year. In January 2005, Commander Bosco Ntaganda was offered a position as a general in the national Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo (FARDC), but had refused the post. The UPC won three National Assembly seats in the 2006 general elections.

It was demolished in the late 1940s. Its site is (in 2020) occupied by part of the derelict runway and safety margins of the former Bristol Filton Airport. The village was located between Filton and what is today the Cribbs Causeway out-of-town commercial and retail area immediately north of Bristol. To the north of the village lay fields and Over Court Deer Park. which is today Bristol Golf Club.  History  The area round Filton near Bristol in England as about 1935 Charlton was a tything in the ancient parish, and later civil parish, of Henbury which still ecclesiastically covers more than . In 1870 Charlton had a population of 425, living in 88 houses. From 1910-1915 the place was served by Charlton Halt, on the Henbury Loop railway just south of the village. In 1935 the civil parish of Henbury was abolished, and Charlton was transferred to the civil parish of Almondsbury. The B4057 road ran through the village.Ordnance Survey map, 1949 Charlton had farm houses, a public house called the Carpenters Arms, a post office, large houses and a few cottages. In the late 1940s most of the village was demolished to make way for an extension of the main runway at Filton Airfield to accommodate the take-off and landing requirements of the Bristol Brabazon propeller-driven airliner. Through compulsory purchase, the government offered residents a market price for their homes and offered rehousing in council housing in Patchway, which many took up to retain community links.  Subsequent use of the site  Filton Airfield, later Bristol Filton Airport, operated until the end of 2012. Although the Brabazon project was cancelled in 1953, the extended runway allowed Britannia production at Filton, Vulcan V bombers to be dispersed to Filton during the Cuban Missile Crisis and Concorde supersonic airliners to take off after being assembled at Filton. It also enabled flight testing from the Bristol Siddeley and Rolls-Royce flight-test centres. It allowed major overhaul and conversion programmes to be done at Filton on General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and Vickers VC10 aircraft. A mixed use development, to be known as New Charlton, has been proposed between Patchway and Cribbs Causeway, on the site of the runway extension over the village.  Survival of the name  The name survives in Charlton Common – a public recreation area, to the south of the original settlement – Charlton Road, which led from Passage Road, Westbury on Trym, to the village, and Charlton Lane, which led from Henbury and Brentry. In the 1970s the name was resurrected for the new development of Charlton Mead, on the south side of Filton Airfield near Southmead, and in 2009 it was used again for the new development of Charlton Hayes, on the north side of Filton Airfield at Patchway.

He wrote for The Sunday Times newspaper and others, and published a number of books. Kimmage was born into a cycling family. His father, Christy, cycled with the Dublin Wheelers, and his brothers Raphael and Kevin were also active. At schoolboy level (under 16) he and his brothers rode with the Orwell Wheelers, at the same time as Stephen Roche. Cycling career=Amateur career Kimmage had a prominent career as an amateur, notably his 6th place at the amateur world road race championship. His brothers also enjoyed the spotlight: Raphael finished second in the 1984 Ras Tailteann, while Kevin won the race in 1991. Kimmage replicated his reputation as a successful amateur in Ireland, for the French ACBB team and the Belgian CC Wasquehal amateur team. He also represented his country at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, California, in the team time trials, where the team placed 16th of 26. Notable performances as an amateur included 5 July 1981 where he became the national road race champion ahead of the old but still competitive Paddy Flanagan. He was sixth in the 1985 amateur world road championship. He also finished ninth in a professional race, the Bordeaux–Paris, behind Belgian René Martens, in 1985. Professional career, 1986-1989 In 1986 Kimmage joined the RMO team under Bernard Thévenet. During his time in the peloton he wrote pieces in Irish newspapers interested in the sport because of the success of countrymen Stephen Roche and Sean Kelly. His career includes ninth on stage 7 of the 1986 Tour de France before completing the Tour in 131st place (his only finish in three participations of the Tour). He was in the Irish team with Stephen Roche, Sean Kelly and Martin Earley that prepared together and competed at the UCI Road World Championships in 1987 that ended with a win by Stephen Roche. Several weeks later during the 1987 Nissan Classic in which Kimmage finished eighth, Kelly thanked Roche, Earley and Kimmage for closing the gap to a break and ensuring his yellow jersey. Kimmage left RMO at the end of 1988 and rode for half a season for the Fagor-MBK team of Stephen Roche and Eddy Schepers with directeur sportif Patrick Valcke. He supported Roche in the 1989 Giro d'Italia which was won by Laurent Fignon with Roche finishing ninth. Kimmage was planning on ending his professional cycling career at the end of the 1989 Nissan Classic which ended each year on O'Connell Street in Dublin but after Roche had to withdraw from the 1989 Tour de France, Kimmage withdrew and subsequently gave up as a professional. =Controversy= Kimmage always struggled with injury and he retired with no wins, blaming systemic doping in the peloton. In his book Rough Ride he talks of taking amphetamines in a post- season exhibition race, something that was common practice at that time in cycling; criterium results were often staged, with a win being guaranteed for the biggest name or local hero. .  Journalism and publishing =Books In May 1990, Kimmage published Rough Ride, detailing his experiences as a domestique which included references to drug use, including his own. Kimmage admitted to using amphetamines to ride non-controlled criteriums on a few occasions, and caffeine suppositories, but says he stayed away from more powerful and dangerous drugs that other cyclists were using. Kimmage wrote a biography of Matt Hampson entitled Engage: The Fall and Rise of Matt Hampson. It was published in August 2011. It won the 2012 British Sports Book Award in the Autobiography/Biography category, and went on to win the overall best book award in all categories.British Sports Book Awards, official website. It was shortlisted for the 2011 William Hill Sports Book of the Year, despite not being longlisted. It was however awarded the 2011 William Hill Irish Sports Book of the Year. Press Kimmage had been a sports journalist with the Sunday Independent in Ireland. He left for the Sunday Times soon after an incident in 2002, when the newspaper misrepresented an article he had written about Roy Keane in the wake of the Saipan saga involving Keane. The editors had taken a quote from Keane out of context to run a headline that implied Keane was planning to leave his wife. Kimmage has been a long-time friend of David Walsh, author of the controversial doping-in-cycling book L.A.

He told Today FM \\"sometimes I let myself down\\" while covering the topic, relating his passion to his own experience in the sport and the knowledge that other riders have died from doping. In 2012 Kimmage was named among the top 10 most influential sportswriters in Britain by the trade publication, UK Press Gazette.In 2012 Samuel was named top in a UK Press Gazette poll of Britain's best sports journalists. Documentary In July 2014, a documentary film called Rough Rider was shown. The documentary was filmed over two years and was set against the fall of Lance Armstrong for doping offences and followed Kimmage as a journalist during the 2013 Tour de France where he questions what is being done to remove the doping culture in professional cycling. Radio Kimmage is a panelist on the Newstalk 106 Sunday Sports radio show and a regular contributor to The Last Word on Today FM. Doping-related controversies=Lance Armstrong Kimmage has a history of confrontations with former professional cyclist Lance Armstrong. Kimmage has invoked the ire of Armstrong over claims that most of Armstrong's early US Postal cycling team were doped, claiming that riders like George Hincapie had taken performance-enhancing drugs. This conflict received widespread coverage before the 2009 Tour of California, when Kimmage asked Armstrong a question regarding dopers. Upon learning the identity of Kimmage, who had earlier referred to Armstrong as the \\"cancer\\" of cycling, Armstrong responded aggressively to the question, with the heated exchange being uploaded to popular video sharing sites. In June 2012, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) charged Armstrong with having used illicit performance-enhancing drugs, and in August they announced a lifetime ban from competition as well as the stripping of all titles since August 1998. On 22 October 2012, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the sport's governing body, endorsed USADA's verdict and confirmed both the lifetime ban and the stripping of titles. These included the Tour de France titles for the years 1999 to 2005.  Floyd Landis interview  In January 2011, nyvelocity.com published the full transcript of a 7-hour interview Paul Kimmage conducted with former professional cyclist Floyd Landis a few days before Thanksgiving of 2010. In the interview, Landis admitted to being involved in doping activities during his time with the US Postal team, where he was often referred to as Lance Armstrong's \\"second in command\\". UCI defamation suit and counter-suit In 2012 Union Cycliste Internationale president Pat McQuaid and former president Hein Verbruggen, as well as UCI itself, sued Kimmage in Switzerland for defamation.

He stated that he was doing it for the whistleblowers who were defamed by the UCI. UCI withdrew its suit fully, and McQuaid allowed his to rest, but Verbruggen pursued his, and secured a win, with Kimmage required to publish apologies, not repeat certain allegations, and pay 12000 euro compensation.

It was built between 1839 and 1844, designed by the court architect Andrei Stackenschneider.  Location  Mariinsky Palace as Seen from the Blue Bridge (1847) by Vasily Sadovnikov The palace stands on the south side of Saint Isaac's Square, just across the Blue Bridge from Saint Isaac's Cathedral. The site had been previously owned by Zakhar Chernyshev, and contained his home designed by Jean-Baptiste Vallin, which was built between 1762 and 1768. Chernyshev occasionally lent his home to foreign dignitaries visiting the capital, such as Louis Henri, Prince of Condé. From 1825 to 1839, the Chernyshev Palace, as it was then known, was the site of the , where Mikhail Lermontov was known to have studied for two years. The palace was demolished in 1839, and materials were reused in the construction of the Mariinsky Palace.  Conception and style  Ceremonial Sitting of the State Council on 7 May 1901 (1904) by Ilya Repin (Russian Museum) The palace was conceived by Nicholas I as a present to his eldest daughter, Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna, on the occasion of her marriage to Maximilian de Beauharnais, Empress Joséphine's grandson. Although the reddish-brown facade is elaborately rusticated and features corinthian columns arranged in a traditional Neoclassical mode, the whole design was inspired by the 17th-century French Baroque messuages. Other eclectic influences are visible in the Renaissance details of exterior ornamentation, and the interior decoration, with each room designed in a different historic style. The palace is now painted white.  State Council  The Mariinsky Palace returned to Imperial ownership in 1884, where it remained until 1917. During that period, the palace housed the State Council, Imperial Chancellery, and Committee of Ministers, which after 1905 became the Council of Ministers. The grand hall for the sessions of the State Council was designed by Leon Benois. On , Socialist Revolutionary Party member Stepan Balmashov assassinated the Minister of Internal Affairs, Dmitry Sipyagin, while the minister was between meetings at the palace. In 1904, painter Ilya Repin completed '. The painting was commissioned as a commemoration of the State Council's centenary. The canvas is , and features 81 historical figures, including Nicholas II. Repin recorded in his journal the painting was on display at the Winter Palace for some time before its installation at Mariinsky Palace.  Government use  The Russian Provisional Government took full possession of the palace in March 1917, and gave it over to the Provisional Council soon after. Following the October Revolution, the palace housed various Soviet ministries and academies. During the war with Germany, the palace was converted to a hospital, and was subject to intense bombing. After the war, the palace became the residence of the Petrograd Soviet. During the 1991 coup attempt, the Emergency Committee used the palace as a base of operations. Barricades and heavy fortifications were constructed along the palace's perimeter, which remained for some time after the coup was suppressed. The palace has been the site of the Legislative Assembly of Saint Petersburg since 1994.  References  * Belyakova Z.I. Mariinsky dvorets. SPb, 1996. * Petrov G.F.

It uses Diffie–Hellman key exchange and the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) for encryption. ZRTP was developed by Phil Zimmermann, with help from Bryce Wilcox-O'Hearn, Colin Plumb, Jon Callas and Alan Johnston and was submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) by Zimmermann, Callas and Johnston on March 5, 2006 and published on April 11, 2011 as . Overview ZRTP (\\"Z\\" is a reference to its inventor, Zimmermann; \\"RTP\\" stands for Real-time Transport Protocol)Alan B. Johnston's Blog: ZRTP Published Today as RFC 6189. Retrieved 2013-01-13 is described in the Internet Draft as a \\"key agreement protocol which performs Diffie–Hellman key exchange during call setup in-band in the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) media stream which has been established using some other signaling protocol such as Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). This generates a shared secret which is then used to generate keys and salt for a Secure RTP (SRTP) session.\\" One of ZRTP's features is that it does not rely on SIP signaling for the key management, or on any servers at all. It supports opportunistic encryption by auto-sensing if the other VoIP client supports ZRTP. This protocol does not require prior shared secrets or rely on a Public key infrastructure (PKI) or on certification authorities, in fact ephemeral Diffie–Hellman keys are generated on each session establishment: this allows the complexity of creating and maintaining a trusted third-party to be bypassed. These keys contribute to the generation of the session secret, from which the session key and parameters for SRTP sessions are derived, along with previously shared secrets (if any): this gives protection against man-in-the- middle (MiTM) attacks, so long as the attacker was not present in the first session between the two endpoints. ZRTP can be used with any signaling protocol, including SIP, H.323, Jingle, and distributed hash table systems. ZRTP is independent of the signaling layer, because all its key negotiations occur via the RTP media stream. ZRTP/S, a ZRTP protocol extension, can run on any kind of legacy telephony networks including GSM, UMTS, ISDN, PSTN, SATCOM, UHF/VHF radio, because it is a narrow-band bitstream-oriented protocol and performs all key negotiations inside the bitstream between two endpoints. Alan Johnston named the protocol ZRTP because in its earliest Internet drafts it was based on adding header extensions to RTP packets, which made ZRTP a variant of RTP. In later drafts the packet format changed to make it syntactically distinguishable from RTP. In view of that change, ZRTP is now a pseudo-acronym. Authentication The Diffie–Hellman key exchange by itself does not provide protection against a man-in-the-middle attack. To ensure that the attacker is indeed not present in the first session (when no shared secrets exist), the Short Authentication String (SAS) method is used: the communicating parties verbally cross-check a shared value displayed at both endpoints. If the values do not match, a man-in-the-middle attack is indicated. (In late 2006 the US NSA developed an experimental voice analysis and synthesis system to defeat this protection,Cryptologic Quarterly, Volume 26, Number 4 but this class of attack is not believed to be a serious risk to the protocol's security.) The SAS is used to authenticate the key exchange, which is essentially a cryptographic hash of the two Diffie–Hellman values. The SAS value is rendered to both ZRTP endpoints. To carry out authentication, this SAS value is read aloud to the communication partner over the voice connection. If the values on both ends do not match, a man-in-middle attack is indicated; if they do match, a man-in-the-middle attack is highly unlikely. The use of hash commitment in the DH exchange constrains the attacker to only one guess to generate the correct SAS in the attack, which means the SAS may be quite short. A 16-bit SAS, for example, provides the attacker only one chance out of 65536 of not being detected. Key continuity ZRTP provides a second layer of authentication against a MitM attack, based on a form of key continuity. It does this by caching some hashed key information for use in the next call, to be mixed in with the next call's DH shared secret, giving it key continuity properties analogous to SSH. If the MitM is not present in the first call, he is locked out of subsequent calls. Thus, even if the SAS is never used, most MitM attacks are stopped because the MitM was not present in the first call.

It is located approximately north west of Charing Cross. The construction of a halt on the Metropolitan Railway in the area in 1912 led to the development of Ruislip Manor, on what was rural land. History Ruislip Manor was originally owned by King's College, Cambridge, as a part of the Manor of Ruislip. At the turn of the 20th century, Ruislip Manor was undeveloped rural land until a halt was constructed in 1912 as part of the Metropolitan Railway running between Harrow and Uxbridge. George Ball later purchased 186 acres to the south of the railway line from King's College with construction of the new estate taking place between 1933 and 1939. Ball hoped the new housing would be available to the working man who wished to purchase his own home. The original plan under the \\"Manor Homes\\" name had been for 2,322 homes which Ball agreed would not number more than 14 per acre. The total number of houses was gradually reduced by 50 in 1934, then a further 35 in 1935, to allow the inclusion of Lady Bankes Primary School, St. Paul's Church and the Black Bull public house. Ruislip Manor shops and tube station in 1978 The school was designed by the Middlesex County architect W.T. Curtis and the assistant architect for educational buildings, H. W. Burchett. A temporary school was opened by the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District Council on 17 October 1934 in the Victoria Hall. Lady Bankes school opened on 7 January 1936, named after Mary, Lady Bankes who had defended Corfe Castle from the Roundheads in the English Civil War.Bowlt 2007, p.20—21 The railway halt was later rebuilt as a station in 1938 and became Ruislip Manor tube station. Along with surrounding areas, Ruislip Manor suffered from heavy aerial bombardment from the Luftwaffe during the Second World War because of its proximity to the fighter airfield RAF Northolt. Children from Bourne Junior School in South Ruislip were sent to Lady Bankes School after their school was requisitioned by the Royal Air Force. Some of the children from Lady Bankes were then accommodated at Sacred Heart School nearby.Bowlt 2007, p.22 Ruislip Manor library was sold for redevelopment by the London Borough of Hillingdon in 2007 and rebuilt on the site of the Victoria Hall, as part of an investment programme for the borough's libraries.

His son, Pietro Ercole Visconti, edited Versi di Ennio Quirino Visconti, raccolti per cura di Pietro Visconti while Louis Visconti became a noted architect in France. His brother, Filippo Aurelio Visconti (died 1830) was also a classical scholar, who published the Museo Chiaramonti, a successor to the Museo Pio-Clementino. Biography Born in Rome, he was the son of Giovanni Battista Antonio Visconti, the curator of Pope Clement XIV, who reorganised and restored the papal collection of antiquities, as the Museo Pio-Clementino. Appointed by Pope Pius VI to succeed his father in the position, the brilliant\\"Giambattista Visconti and his brilliant son\\" Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1981:61. and precociousAn extended obituary in The Gentleman's Magazine, June 1818 recalls his early verse translations of Pindar and the translation into Italian verse of Euripides' Hecuba, printed when he was thirteen Ecuba, tragedia di Euripide, trasportata in versi italiana da Ennio Quirino Visconti, fanciullo romano (Rome: A. Casaletti, 1765). Visconti took up his father's position as conservator of the Capitoline Museums in Rome in 1787. He assisted his father in producing the first volume of the Museo Pio-Clementino (1782) and produced the six remaining volumes himself, completing the last in 1807; this catalogue of the Roman sculpture and antiquities in the Vatican collections, published in the course of many years, \\"made an impact on archaeological studies second only to that of Winckelmann.\\"Francis Haskell and Nicholas Penny, Taste and the Antique: the Lure of Classical Sculpture 1500-1900 (Yale University Press) 1981:61. He also published the antiquities collected in Greece by Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet in Museum Worsleyanum (1794)Museum Worsleyanum, or, A collection of antique basso relievos, bustos, statues and gems with views of places in the Levant taken on the spot in the years MDCCLXXX and the sculptures in the Villa Borghese, (1796). In 1798, Visconti became one of five consuls of the short- lived Roman Republic. With the restoration of papal control in Rome he had to emigrate to Paris, where his presence was most welcome: \\"this event we considered as one of the happiest results of our victories\\", wrote the antiquary Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison.Millin's quote is in the extended obituary of Visconti in The Gentleman's Magazine, June 1818. At the end of 1799 he became curator of antiquities of the Musée Napoleon housed in the Louvre, many of which were familiar to him as booty removed under the stipulations of the Treaty of Tolentino (1797); his descriptions were published by Robillard-Péronville in Le Musée français;Le Musée Français, recueil complete des Tableaux, Statues et Bas-Reliefs, qui composent la Collection Nationale, 1803-09. In 1803 he was made professor of archaeology at the Institut de France. In Paris he published a series of portraits of famous men of Antiquity: Iconographie Grecque, 3 vols. 1808, and a first volume of Iconographie Romaine, 1818. At his death, extended obituaries were published by Quatremère de QuincyQuatremère de Quincy, Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de Visconti, 1818. and others.Giovanni Labus, Notizie biografiche intorno la vita di E.Q. Visconti, 1818; Émile Dacier, Éloge d'E.Q. Visconti. When Parliamentary debates were mooting the acquisition of the Elgin Marbles for the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Visconti was among the scholars asked to offer statements of their cultural value; his memoir was translated into English and published. Visconti was succeeded as curator of antiquities at the Louvre by Charles Othon Frédéric Jean-Baptiste de Clarac. Visconti was firmly grounded in the antiquarian traditions of connoisseurship. He rated associative values high in portraits and assumed portraits of the great (both philosophers and emperors). He concentrated on disentangling the iconography of the sculptures and reliefs he was describing. Visconti is also a liminal figure at the beginnings of modern art history, as when, Haskell and Penny note, he concedes that he has perhaps overestimated the beauty of a statue in his delight at recognising in it the portrait of Phocion.Visconti, Museo Pio-Clementino ii, pl. xlviii, noted by Haskell and Penny 1981:50. His sense of loyalty to the sculpture he had grown up with induced him to see in the best of these copies of classical Greek and Hellenistic originals, such as the Apollo Belvedere and Laocoön and His Sons, \\"perfected imitations\\" made for Roman collectors of taste, and that the traditions of ancient sculpture were a cumulative history of improvements, rather as Virgil, it was felt, refined and improved upon Homer. Medal Ennio Quirino Visconti 1818 In 1818 after his death a medal was struck in his honour. This medal is part of a series in order to commemorate illustrious French men illustrating his renown at the time.http://hdl.handle.net/10900/100742 S. Krmnicek und M. Gaidys, Gelehrtenbilder.

Early life  Mini was born in 1920 in Tsomo in rural Transkei. Mini's father who was born in Tsomo and later moved to Port Elizabeth as a young man was a Port Elizabeth dockworker active in labour and community struggles, which inspired Mini, at 17, to take part in bus fare and rent increase protests. He was also active in campaigns against forced removals of Black people from Korsten (where he lived) to Kwazakhele. After completing elementary school, he worked as a labourer and trade union organiser.  Union career  His union comrades knew Mini as the \\"organizer of the unorganized\\", because of his courage and tireless efforts to organize workers across Eastern Cape during the increasingly repressive 1950s. Mini was tasked by the South African Congress of Trade Unions (SACTU) to organize the metal workers and he subsequently became the Metal Workers' Union Secretary. Together with another activist, Stephen Tobia, they founded the African Painting and Building Union. He was also a founding member of the Port Elizabeth Stevedoring and Dockworkers Union, which embarked in the 1950s on one of the longest protests for a wage increase, and fought against the use of convicts for strike breaking.  Activist actions  Mini's militant political activities began in 1951 when he joined the African National Congress. In 1952 he was jailed with Govan Mbeki and Raymond Mhlaba for three months in Rooi Hel ('Red Hell' or North End Prison, Port Elizabeth) for participation in the 'Campaign of Defiance against Unjust Laws' (Defiance Campaign). He intentionally entered railway property reserved for Whites only, and because of his imprisonment, lost his job as a packer in a battery factory. On his release he married his trade union work with political activism, rose rapidly in the ranks of the ANC and was elected secretary of the ANC Cape region. In 1956 Mini was one of 156 defendants in the famous Treason Trial. The state's case collapsed for lack of evidence and Mini was discharged on 20 April 1959. In 1960 he became secretary of the Eastern Cape branch of SACTU, a target of repression. He was arrested and detained along with Govan Mbeki, Temba Mqota, Raymond Mhlaba, J Makgatho, F Matomela, Alvin Bennie, Frances Baard, Norman Ntshinga, V Bisset, S Ndzube, Father Mark Nye, H Stanton, Dr Colin Lang, John Brink, Chief Albert Luthuli, Peter Tsele, Titus Maimela, Samuel Maimela, Peter Brown, Dr Hans Meidner, Dr G M Naicker, M P Naicker [Durban editor of New Age], Helen Joseph, and many others under the State of Emergency declared under the Public Safety Act on 30 March 1960.\\"State of Emergency Declared\\", SAPA, Evening Post, 30 March 1960 In 1961, Mini was one of the first group of people to be recruited into uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK), and become a member of the Eastern Cape High Command. Mini was arrested on 10 May 1963 together with two other prominent ANC members, Wilson Khayinga and Zinakile Mkaba. They were charged with 17 counts of sabotage and other political crimes including complicity in the January 1963 death of Sipho Mange, an alleged police informer.  Death sentence  In March 1964 the three were sentenced to death. This provoked an international outcry, and clemency appeals by President Nasser of the United Arab Republic, on behalf of the Non-aligned States, and by Secretary-General U Thant of the United Nations were unsuccessful. So too were approaches by the UN Special Committee on Apartheid and the UN Security Council. Mini, Wilson Khayinga and Zinakile Mkaba were hanged in the Pretoria Central Prison on 6 November 1964. Mini went to the gallows singing freedom songs, some he had composed. In a spirit of defiance, Mini made a death row statement after an approach by security police to get him to bear witness against comrades. Ben Turok, a previous co-accused of Mini's in the 1956 Treason Trial, was serving a three-year term in Pretoria prison for MK activities at the time of Mini's execution. He recalled the last moments of Mini (44), Khayinga (38) and Mkaba (35) life in Sechaba, the official ANC journal:  Legacy  After his 1964 execution, Mini was secretly buried in a pauper's grave at Rebecca Street Cemetery in Pretoria. The bodies of Mini, Khayinga and Mkaba were exhumed in 1998 at Rebecca Street Cemetery in Pretoria and Mini was given a heroes funeral when he was re-interred at the Emlotheni Memorial Park in New Brighton township in Port Elizabeth. On 27 June 1998, the park was officially opened by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki and the Mayor of Port Elizabeth, Nceba Faku.Memorial plaque at Emlotheni Memorial Park. On 6 November 2010, Port Elizabeth's Market Square was renamed Vuyisile Mini Square. The ANC Mission Office in Tanzania opened a Furniture factory that was known as the Vuyisile Mini Factory (VMF). At the time of his death, Mini was married, and had six children. One of his children, Nomkhosi Mini became a member of MK and survived a March 1979 South African Defence Force attack on the Novo Catengue camp in Angola. She was shot dead by members of the notorious Vlakplaas hit squad when they raided two houses in Maseru, Lesotho on 19 December 1985. Seven members of the Security branch, including its then deputy chief were refused amnesty for this killing.  Private life  Mini was a gifted actor, dancer, poet and singer (he was a member of various groups and a prominent member of the P.E. Male Voice Choir). He is remembered for the songs he composed as well as their delivery in his powerful bass voice, sometimes militant, and at other times nostalgic. His words composed during the Treason Trial, Thath' unthwalo Buti sigoduke balindile umama no bab' ekhaya (Take up your things Brother and let's go, they are waiting, our mothers and fathers, at home), came to take on new associations as the forced relocation scheme of apartheid made Black people refugees in the land of their birth. He is remembered for composing one of the most popular liberation songs of the 1950s, Pasopa nantsi 'ndondemnyama we Verwoerd, (Look out, Verwoerd, here are the Black people).

For the British publication the title was amended to The Last Enemy, taken from (I Corinthians 15:26, \\"The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death\\".\\"Embrace of the last enemy\\" in The Times, 11 January 2003 Other media A television dramatization of the book was produced in 1956.The Last Enemy at the Internet Movie Database Reception Hillary's biographer, Denis Richards, writes that the book and its author met with instant acclaim, although the book was unusual in the depth of its storytelling:\\"Richard Hillary\\" in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 > The author was acclaimed not only as a natural writer, but also as a > representative of the doomed youth of his generation, although in his > constant self-analysis he was in fact a most untypical British fighter pilot > of 1940. In the preface for the book's first edition in 1942 J.B. Priestley wrote: 'The Last Enemy differs from all other books about the R.A.F. because its author, Richard Hillary, is by temperament and inclination, and to some extent training, a writer. ... The value of this book lies in the fact that it is a statement of a fully articulate young man about life in a Service which is generally inarticulate.

Location The town is south of Perth on the Great Southern Highway, from Katanning and from Wagin. The town is in a sheep and grain producing area and was named after a spring in the Boyerine Creek, found about south of town. History The Wiilman people are the traditional owners of the Woodanilling area. During 1830–31, the area was first explored by Europeans, in expeditions by Captain Thomas Bannister. The construction of Albany Highway in the early 1850s and the Great Southern Railway in 1889 brought settlers to the area and helped to establish the town, which was located on a railway siding that was initially known as Round Pool. The townsite was gazetted in 1892. In 1895 it was renamed Yarabin and changed finally to Woodanilling the following year (1896). The name Woodanilling is Aboriginal in origin and means either \\"lots of minnows\\" or \\"place where the bronzewing pigeon nests\\". An agricultural hall and public school were built in the town prior to 1903 (when the school was closed temporarily after the teacher, a Mr Campbell, was transferred). By 1906, the Woodanilling Road Board was formed and the population of the shire swelled to 800, during its most prosperous period (1905 to 1920). At around this time the town boasted five general stores, a blacksmith, post office, bakery, hotel, railway station and trotting track. \\"Mallet\\" (marlock or mallee) bark was also exported from the area in large quantities by 1907. The foundation stone of the local Baptist church was laid in 1908 in front of a large gathering including the local pastor, Rev. W. Kennedy. The Western Australian Bank branch and new hotel were erected in the town in 1908, along with many improvements being made to the school. Local farmers were confident of a bumper crop after experiencing favourable conditions for the year. The railway station yard was upgraded later the same year, a weighbridge, new crossing, tracking yards and enlarging the current yard were all completed the following year. The school changed teachers four times in 1908, with finding suitable quarters being the main problem. The school was also enlarged to cater for the growing enrolment. Between 1920 and 1960 migrants from Ireland, Germany, England and even China arrived contributing to the fabric of the local community. The local school was destroyed by fire in June 1949, the school had 64 students enrolled at the time. By November the minister of education decided that a new primary school would be built but older students would travel to Katanning for their classes. Economy The town services the surrounding area which is primarily concerned with sheep and wheat.

However, on other architectures such as PowerPC, certain software bugs such as invalid memory accesses can cause machine-check exceptions. The error usually occurs due to component failure or the overheating or overclocking of hardware components. Most machine check exceptions halt the operating system and require a restart before users can continue normal operation. Diagnosing the failure can be often difficult because so little information about what caused the problem is captured during the error. Modern versions of Microsoft Windows on IA-32 and x86-64 processors handle machine check exceptions through the Windows Hardware Error Architecture. When WHEA detects a machine check exception, it displays the error in a Blue Screen of Death, with the following parameters (which vary, but the first parameter is always 0x0 for a machine check exception): *** STOP: 0x00000124 (0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000) Older versions of Windows handle similar exceptions through the Machine Check Architecture. In this case, the Blue Screen of Death will show an error similar to the following: STOP: 0x0000009C (0x00000030, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x80003CBA) On Linux, a process (such as \`klogd\`) writes a message to the kernel log and/or the console screen (usually only to the console when the error is non-recoverable and the machine crashes as a result): CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0000000000000004 Bank 2: f200200000000863 Kernel panic: CPU context corrupt''' Problem types Most of these errors relate specifically to the Pentium processor family. Similar errors may occur on other processors and will cause similar problems. Some of the main hardware problems that cause MCEs include: * System bus errors: (error communicating between the processor and the motherboard). * Memory errors: parity checking detects when a memory error has occurred. Error correction code (ECC) can correct limited memory errors so that processing can continue. * Cache errors in the processor. Possible causes Machine checks are a hardware problem, not a software problem. They are often the result of overclocking or overheating. In some cases, the CPU will shut itself off once passing a thermal limit to avoid permanent damage. But they can also be caused by bus errors introduced by other failing components, like memory or I/O devices. Possible causes include: * Poor CPU cooling due to a CPU heatsink and fan that's clogged with dust or has come loose. * Overclocking beyond the highest clock rate at which the CPU is still reliable. * Failing motherboard. * Failing processor. * Failing memory. * Failing I/O controllers, on either the motherboard or separate cards. * Failing I/O devices. * Inadequate or failing power supply. * Poor general case cooling due to inadequate or clogged case fans or filters. Cooling problems are usually obvious upon inspection. A failing motherboard or processor can be identified by swapping them with functioning parts. Memory can be checked by booting to a diagnostic tool, like memtest86. Non-essential failing I/O devices and controllers can be identified by unplugging them if possible or disabling the devices to see if the problem disappears. If the failures typically only occur fairly soon after the OS is booted or not at all or not for days, it may be suggestive of a power supply issue. With a power supply problem, the failure often occurs when power demand peaks as the OS starts up any external devices for use. Decoding MCEs As noted previously, decoding MCE errors can prove difficult. Normally the processor manufacturer will be able to provide information about specific codes. For IA-32 and Intel 64 processors, consult the Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Chapter 15 (Machine-Check Architecture), or the Microsoft KB Article on Windows Exceptions. Programs to decode Intel and AMD MCEs * mcat: A Windows command-line program from AMD to decode MCEs from AMD K8, Family 0x10 and 0x11 processors. * mcelog A Linux daemon by Andi Kleen to handle MCEs for modern x86 processors. mcelog can also decode machine checks. * parsemce a Linux program by Dave Jones to decode MCEs from AMD K7 processors. * mced a Linux program by Tim Hockin to gather MCEs from the kernel and alert interested applications. Note that it does not try to interpret the MCE data, it simply alerts other programs.

Cheney, is a stop and copy method of tracing garbage collection in computer software systems. In this scheme, the heap is divided into two equal halves, only one of which is in use at any one time. Garbage collection is performed by copying live objects from one semispace (the from-space) to the other (the to-space), which then becomes the new heap. The entire old heap is then discarded in one piece. It is an improvement on the previous stop and copy technique. Cheney's algorithm reclaims items as follows: * Object references on the stack. Object references on the stack are checked. One of the two following actions is taken for each object reference that points to an object in from-space: ** If the object has not yet been moved to the to-space, this is done by creating an identical copy in the to-space, and then replacing the from-space version with a forwarding pointer to the to-space copy. Then update the object reference to refer to the new version in to-space. ** If the object has already been moved to the to-space, simply update the reference from the forwarding pointer in from-space. * Objects in the to-space. The garbage collector examines all object references in the objects that have been migrated to the to-space, and performs one of the above two actions on the referenced objects. Once all to- space references have been examined and updated, garbage collection is complete. The algorithm needs no stack and only two pointers outside of the from-space and to-space: a pointer to the beginning of free space in the to- space, and a pointer to the next word in to-space that needs to be examined. For this reason, it is sometimes called a \\"two-finger\\" collector—it only needs \\"two fingers\\" pointing into the to-space to keep track of its state. The data between the two fingers represents work remaining for it to do. The forwarding pointer (sometimes called a \\"broken heart\\") is used only during the garbage collection process; when a reference to an object already in to-space (thus having a forwarding pointer in from-space) is found, the reference can be updated quickly simply by updating its pointer to match the forwarding pointer. Because the strategy is to exhaust all live references, and then all references in referenced objects, this is known as a breadth-first list copying garbage collection scheme. Sample algorithm initialize() = tospace = N/2 fromspace = 0 allocPtr = fromspace scanPtr = whatever -- only used during collection allocate(n) = If allocPtr + n > fromspace + tospace collect() EndIf If allocPtr + n > fromspace + tospace fail “insufficient memory” EndIf o = allocPtr allocPtr = allocPtr + n return o collect() = swap(fromspace, tospace) allocPtr = tospace scanPtr = tospace -- scan every root you've got ForEach root in the stack -- or elsewhere root = copy(root) EndForEach -- scan objects in the to-space (including objects added by this loop) While scanPtr < allocPtr ForEach reference r from o (pointed to by scanPtr) r = copy(r) EndForEach scanPtr = scanPtr + o.size() -- points to the next object in the to-space, if any EndWhile copy(o) = If o has no forwarding address o' = allocPtr allocPtr = allocPtr + size(o) copy the contents of o to o' forwarding-address(o) = o' EndIf return forwarding-address(o)  Semispace  Cheney based his work on the semispace garbage collector, which was published a year earlier by R.R. Fenichel and J.C. Yochelson.  Equivalence to tri-color abstraction  Cheney's algorithm is an example of a tri-color marking garbage collector. The first member of the gray set is the stack itself. Objects referenced on the stack are copied into the to-space, which contains members of the black and gray sets. The algorithm moves any white objects (equivalent to objects in the from-space without forwarding pointers) to the gray set by copying them to the to-space. Objects that are between the scanning pointer and the free-space pointer on the to-space area are members of the gray set still to be scanned. Objects below the scanning pointer belong to the black set. Objects are moved to the black set by simply moving the scanning pointer over them. When the scanning pointer reaches the free-space pointer, the gray set is empty, and the algorithm ends.

Henryk Mandelbaum (December 15, 1922 – June 17, 2008) was a Polish survivor of the Holocaust. He was one of the prisoners in the Sonderkommando KL Auschwitz-Birkenau in the Auschwitz- Birkenau concentration camp who had to work in the crematory. Only 110 out of 2,000 prisoners survived the Sonderkommandos in Auschwitz-Birkenau, as of the death of Dario Gabai in 2020, no former Auschwitz-Birkenau Sonderkommando are known to be alive. Mandelbaum was imprisoned as a Polish Jew at the age of 21 years. He fled from the Sosnowiec Ghetto and was reimprisoned on April 22, 1944, in Birkenau. Auschwitz After arriving to Auschwitz, Mandelbaum was designated to forced labour in the crematory. He had to carry the corpses of the people who were gassed with Zyklon B, check body orifices for valuables and break out dental gold. In 1944 the capacity of the crematoriums was too small to burn all the corpses of prisoners killed. Mandelbaum and others had to dig two huge pits, then burn the dead bodies in them. To improve the process they had to pour back the body fat, which was collected in small holes in the pit, over the top of the pile. Mandelbaum participated in the rebellion of inmates on October 7, 1944, which was put down quickly by the SS. Afterwards, 451 of the inmates were shot or hanged. This was the third rebellion in a camp after Treblinka (August 2, 1943) and Sobibor (October 14, 1943). On a death march from Auschwitz to Loslau in January 1945 he was able to flee. He escaped wearing civilian clothes and hid on a farm for three weeks. After the liberation of Auschwitz he identified himself to the Wahrheitsfindungskommission (fact-finding commission) as an eyewitness. Mandelbaum continued to live in Poland until his death and still carried the number 181 970 on his left forearm. He often travelled to the former Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz and to Germany to speak about his experiences. He said that young people especially should learn what happened in Auschwitz- Birkenau in 1945: \\"Man muss das doch alles wissen, man muss doch wissen, wie lange die Leute in den Gaskammern gewesen sind. Man muss wissen, wie lange sie gebrannt haben in den Öfen\\" (\\"People need to know, they really need to know, just how long the people were in the gas chambers. People need to know how long they burned in the ovens\\"). He sat as chair of the Auschwitz Museum directors and was keenly involved in publicising Auschwitz. After the war, he was an officer of the Poviat Office for Public Security (UB) in Będzin in 1945-48. He died on June 17, 2008, in the Polish city of Bytom, following heart surgery.

When the LPO provider is based in another country, the practice is called offshoring and involves the practice of outsourcing any activity except those where personal presence or contact is required, e.g. appearances in court and face-to-face negotiations. When the LPO provider is based in the same country, the practice of outsourcing includes agency work and other services requiring a physical presence, such as court appearances. This process is one of the incidents of the larger movement towards outsourcing. The most commonly offered services have been agency work, document review, legal research and writing, drafting of pleadings and briefs, and patent services. This phenomenon has been a part of the legal experience since the 1950s, where it was restricted only to patents. Later, firms began to contract certain services to back door firms. The process of subcontracting part of the legal process to different countries is at a nascent stage, with relatively consistent market growth. Legal process outsourcing has predominantly been to countries that had previously taken advantage of the business process outsourcing wave. LPO providers have established themselves in Canada, India, the Philippines, the United States, Israel, and Latin America. Overview The concept of legal process outsourcing is based on the division of labour principle, prevalent in law firms, where various time consuming and onerous processes like due diligence are delegated to paralegals, document reviewers or interns. This allows the firm to address the various legal issues that arise on a daily basis while being able to streamline productivity. The process involves a contract, with due consideration, between both firms. The following are the various methods by which the process could be initiated: *Direct Contract – This is the most straight forward means of establishing contact. The firm needing legal services directly approaches the legal process outsourcing vendor. *Managed Outsourcing – This is a case where the firm establishes contact with a legal process outsourcing vendor and retains a traditional law firm to coordinate the vendor's activities and to ensure quality control. *Required Outsourcing – This form of outsourcing occurs when the firm mandates a certain level of outsourcing in the legal process, either to reduce costs or to fulfill statutory requirements. *Multi-sourcing – This involves segregating the work assigned to LPO providers in order to reduce risk and take advantage of each provider's strengths. This approach is helpful in cases where expertise is required on matters of jurisdiction and merits. Having more than one provider \\"on deck\\" also allows a service recipient to obtain more favorable pricing. On the other hand, multi-sourcing can be more complicated than other approaches. Successfully managing multiple, competing providers requires strong and effective governance procedures. Reasons Among the leading proponents of this process have been corporate clients concerned with rising legal expenses. The legal departments of corporations began using the services of such providers. Soon these corporations began to pressure their legal representatives to outsource certain legal processes to cut costs. Cost saving is the biggest attraction for the western firms that outsource their legal work. India's legal services are widely considered affordable, efficient, and above all, skilled. For a legal job outsourced in India, the U.S. firm pays hardly one-fourth or one-fifth of what it has to pay in the U.S. for the same work. Advantages Most firms and corporations outsource primarily to save cash, and this is considered the biggest advantage for legal outsourcing. While an attorney in major legal markets such as the US may charge from $150 to $500 per hour when performing rote services, legal process outsourcing firms generally charge a small fraction of that price. It has attracted major corporations to outsource specific work outside their legal departments. Many destinations for outsourcing have benefited from the upsurge in bankruptcies and litigations that have occurred in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis. As reported in the ABA Journal, \\"[t]he market for outsourced legal work is booming in India. While lawyers there are doing a lot of routine work, they are also handling some interesting legal matters, including work for the makers of movies and television shows.\\" As stated in USA Today, \\"'[y]ou could call it \\"Outsourcing 2.0\\" or maybe even \\"3.0.\\" Now firms are increasingly trying to leverage expertise,' says Saikat Chaudhuri, an assistant professor in the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. Legal Outsourcing is 'growing very, very quickly.'\\" LPO industry and the global financial crisis LPO firms in India had predicted an annual growth of 200% due to recession related litigation and the increased need to save costs in the US. Their expectations have not been met. The major reason for this is that US lawyers themselves have started looking at alternative fee structures due to the recession and job losses. In spite of setbacks, the LPO industry has seen growth of about 40-60% in the last year. Although some areas of practice, such as real estate, have drastically collapsed due to the recession, some areas such as litigation, document review, and corporate compliance have gained ground, resulting in business directed to LPO firms in India. Criticisms One of the major concerns with outsourcing is the potential for breaches of client confidentiality. In legal process outsourcing the issue of client confidentiality assumes utmost importance. The attorney–client privilege is a doctrine that says anything conveyed between an attorney and his client shall be treated with utmost confidentiality and is exempted from disclosure even in a court of law. However, when either party discloses confidential information to a third party or the opposite party, the privilege is deemed to be waived. During the early years of legal process outsourcing, many law firms hesitated to outsource their work. Critics and opponents state that, since communication is being sent to a country other than United States, the confidentiality is broken; hence, the attorney client privilege has been waived. However, American Bar Association clarified this in 2008, clearing the way for the development of legal process outsourcing.ABA Opinion on Legal Outsourcing Another criticism is that people performing legal work may not be bound to necessary ethical standards. The process of Legal Outsourcing has come in conflict with the Model Code of Conduct issued by the American Bar Association. However, there have been ethics opinions from various local bar associations (New York, San Diego) and recently the American Bar Association that discuss ethical legal outsourcing and how to achieve it. However, there is criticism that the use of legal outsourcing creates a breach of ABA Model Rule 5.4 which prohibits attorneys from sharing fees with non-attorneys and, also, the prohibition on the practice of law by foreign non-attorneys. New frontiers India is considered to be a major destination for legal outsourcing due to its availability of affordable English-speaking lawyers, some of whom are UK and/or US educated, and due to a legal system that is based on English common law. Recently, new frontiers for legal outsourcing have emerged in geographic areas closer to their target client markets. Other established LPO providers can be found in Argentina, Australia, China, France, the Philippines, Singapore, and South Korea, each offering unique advantages concomitant with their distinctive geographic location, language capabilities and regional expertise. \\"There is natural arbitrage between the excellent talented and low cost professionals in India, compared to the US and other developed jurisdictions, especially in the litigation management space\\", believes Zia Mody, managing partner AZB & Partners, one of the biggest law firms in India. Argentina, for example, is an increasingly desirable LPO centre for the U.S. client market due to its proximity in terms of its western hemisphere location, time zone similarity, and cultural ties to the United States. Sri Lanka, as an additional example, is an Indian competitorhttp://www.pwc.com/ca/en/media/release/2010-02-04-global- outsourcing.jhtml whose success has come from a familiarity with British law, a strong economic infrastructure, online freedom, and marketing by Indian policymakers. LPO providers in India and in these new frontiers are increasingly utilizing onshore and offshore US and UK-licensed attorneys as part of their outsourcing offering as a means to create greater quality controls, expand into more sophisticated offerings, and instill higher confidence in the ethical treatment of client sensitive data.

Oxygenation of blood in the lungs displaces carbon dioxide from hemoglobin which increases the removal of carbon dioxide. This property is the Haldane effect. Consequently, oxygenated blood has a reduced affinity for carbon dioxide. Thus, the Haldane effect describes the ability of hemoglobin to carry increased amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the deoxygenated state as opposed to the oxygenated state. A high concentration of CO2 facilitates dissociation of oxyhemoglobin. Carbaminohemoglobin Carbon dioxide can bind to amino groups, creating carbamino compounds. Amino groups are available for binding at the N-terminals and at side-chains of arginine and lysine residues in hemoglobin. This forms carbaminohemoglobin. Carbaminohemoglobin is the major contributor to the Haldane effect. Buffering Histidine residues in hemoglobin can accept and act as buffers. Deoxygenated hemoglobin is a better proton acceptor than the oxygenated form. In red blood cells, the enzyme carbonic anhydrase catalyzes the conversion of dissolved carbon dioxide to carbonic acid, which rapidly dissociates to bicarbonate and a free proton: :CO2 \\\\+ H2O → H2CO3 → H+ \\\\+ HCO3− By Le Chatelier's principle, anything that stabilizes the proton produced will cause the reaction to shift to the right, thus the enhanced affinity of deoxyhemoglobin for protons enhances synthesis of bicarbonate and accordingly increases capacity of deoxygenated blood for carbon dioxide. The majority of carbon dioxide in the blood is in the form of bicarbonate. Only a very small amount is actually dissolved as carbon dioxide, and the remaining amount of carbon dioxide is bound to hemoglobin. In addition to enhancing removal of carbon dioxide from oxygen-consuming tissues, the Haldane effect promotes dissociation of carbon dioxide from hemoglobin in the presence of oxygen. In the oxygen-rich capillaries of the lung, this property causes the displacement of carbon dioxide to plasma as low-oxygen blood enters the alveolus and is vital for alveolar gas exchange. The general equation for the Haldane Effect is: :H+ \\\\+ HbO2 H+Hb + O2; However, this equation is confusing as it reflects primarily the Bohr effect. The significance of this equation lies in realizing that oxygenation of Hb promotes dissociation of H+ from Hb, which shifts the bicarbonate buffer equilibrium towards CO2 formation; therefore, CO2 is released from RBCs. Clinical significance In patients with lung disease, lungs may not be able to increase alveolar ventilation in the face of increased amounts of dissolved CO2. This partially explains the observation that some patients with emphysema might have an increase in PaCO2 (partial pressure of arterial dissolved carbon dioxide) following administration of supplemental oxygen even if content of CO2 stays equal.

The only species yet assigned to this taxon, Pawpawsaurus campbelli, is based on a complete skull (lacking mandibles) from the marine Paw Paw Formation (Wachita Group). Discovery Pawpawsaurus was found in the Paw Paw Formation in Tarrant County, Texas, in May 1992, by Cameron Campbell. A complete skull is the only specimen, from which the binomial was named Pawpawsaurus campbelli. The Paw Paw Formation has produced another nodosaurid, Texasetes pleurohalio (Coombs, 1995), which may prove to be a senior synonym of Pawpawsaurus. This is the only nodosaurid known to have possessed the bony eyelids commonly found in ankylosaurids. The skull of Pawpawsaurus bears some notable similarities to that of Silvisaurus, such as the presence of teeth in the premaxilla and the restriction of the osseous secondary palate to the rostral portion of the palatal region. Description Skull cast in front view Pawpawsaurus is known from a relatively well preserved and complete skull. The skull is complete enough for a 2016 study to be able to identify and reconstruct the brain, nasal cavities and inner ear of the specimen, and CT scan it to find new anatomical features. The brain of Pawpawsaurus is very similar to other ankylosaurians, but along with more derived taxa it is most different from Kunbarrasaurus. The brain is 30% of the skull length, very similar to Panoplosaurus, higher than Euoplocephalus, and lower than Kunbarrasaurus. The brain of Pawpawsaurus is long and wide. The inner ear is also similar to ankylosaurians to the exclusion of Kunbarrasaurus, being tall and wide at the level of the semicircular canals. The nasal cavities of Pawpawsaurus resemble that of Panoplosaurus and Euoplocephalus, although the thin dividing medians are not preserved as they were likely cartilaginous. Classification Based on the dimensions of the skull, Pawpawsaurus is believed to have been approximately 4.5 meters in length. Vickaryous et al. (2004) have stated that \\"Sauropelta edwardsorum, Silvisaurus condrayi, and Pawpawsaurus campbelli form a basal polytomy nested deep to Cedarpelta.\\" Palaeobiology Pawpawsaurus was primitive in regards to its sensory abilities when compared to later ankylosaurs. CT scans of its skull and brain by Paulina-Carabajal and Louis Jacobs et al. revealed that Pawpawsaurus' hearing was on par with that of modern crocodilians, indicating that its hearing was relatively poor. Its sense of smell meanwhile, while not as advanced as that of later ankylosaurs, was still more powerful and acute than many of the theropods existent at the time thanks to its large nasal cavities. The enlarged nasal cavities of Pawpawsaurus would also likely have been useful for cooling blood that was entering the brain, finding food and potential mates, or alerting it to danger.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160524123443.htm See also * Timeline of ankylosaur research ReferencesExternal links * Pawpawsaurus web site * Digimorph 3D Pawpawsaurus skull Category:Nodosaurids Category:Early Cretaceous dinosaurs of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1996 Category:Paleontology in Texas ","title":"Pawpawsaurus"},{"id":"4423028","text":"The Packard Caribbean was a personal luxury car produced by the Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, during model years 1953 through 1956. Some of the Caribbean's styling was derived from the Pan American Packard show car of the previous year. It was produced only as a convertible from 1953 to 1955, but a hardtop model was added in its final year of 1956. 1953 1953 Packard Caribbean Convertible The 1953 Caribbean was perhaps Packard's most easily identified car because of its full cutout rear wheel housing and side trim, limited to a chrome band outline that stretched the entire length of the car. The band also helped to further delineate the car's wheel openings. A steel continental spare tire was also standard. The hood featured a broad, low leaded-in hood scoop. Bodies for the Caribbean were modified by Mitchell- Bentley Corporation of Ionia, Michigan. Available \\"advertised\\" colors for the car were limited to Polaris Blue, Gulf Green Metallic, Maroon Metallic or Sahara Sand. However, a mere handful of special-ordered cars were built in Ivory or Black. Interiors of the Caribbean were richly upholstered in leather. Most Caribbeans were also generously optioned, although the Ultramatic transmission and power windows were optional cost items on the first year model. A total of 750 Caribbeans were built for the first model year, and these cars are highly sought after as collectible cars in the current collectible automobile market. Restored cars regularly sell in the six-figure ranges. 1954 1954 Packard Caribbean Convertible Beginning in 1954 the Caribbean was elevated to senior Packard status. The Caribbean continued to have its own unique styling features, however the full rear-wheel cut-outs were eliminated and the use of chrome/stainless trim became more liberal, and allowed for two-tone paint combinations. A four-way power seat was available. Like the Patrician, the Caribbean also gained heavier \\"finned\\" headlight housings, one of the visual cues applied to help differentiate the senior Packards from their lower priced brethren. The straight eight senior engine was used in this final incarnation of Packard's straight eight engine. A total of only 400 Caribbeans were produced for the model year, making 1954 the rarest year for the Caribbean. 1955 1955 Packard Caribbean Convertible 1955 Packard Caribbean Convertible.Ystad 2018. Model year 1955 saw the Caribbean line, now with an all-new Packard developed V8 engine, fully adopt the Senior Packard line styling; the car was also available in two or three- tone paint patterns. Designer Richard Teague succeeded in restyling the old Packard Senior body into a sensational, modern-looking design. The single hood scoop was split into two units. The car also received Packard's torsion level suspension. Production for 1955 stood at 500 units. 1956 1956 Packard Caribbean Convertible 1956 Packard Caribbean Hardtop For 1956, the Caribbean was broken out into its own luxury series, and gained a hardtop model. Trim differences between the 1955 and 1956 cars were slight. Grille textures changed, and matched the ones used on concurrent Patricians, and the rear treatment, featuring Packard's cathedral style taillights also continued. The headlights also received slightly more exaggerated hoods. Unique new interiors featured reversible seat cushions with cloth on one side and leather on the other. Total model year production equaled 263 hardtops and 276 convertibles. The model was discontinued when Packard production ended in Detroit.

Martin Banham, 1988. Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 225 pp. . The play initially premiered on April 10, 1934 at the Theatre Louis Jouvet in Paris, France, under the direction of Louis Jouvet himself, with costumes and scene design by Christian Bérard.Jean Cocteau, The Infernal Machine & Other Plays, New Directions, 1964. . The Infernal Machine, as translated by Albert Bermel, was first played at the Phoenix Theatre, New York, on February 3, 1958, under the direction of Herbert Berghof, with scenery by Ming Cho Lee, costumes by Alvin Colt, and lighting by Tharon Musser. Plot summary= Prologue  The Voice presents a brief prologue and information about events that have occurred before the action of the play takes place. The Voice recounts that a baby is abandoned on a mountainside. The baby, Oedipus, is adopted by the King of Corinth. Oedipus questions the Oracle of Delphi who says he will murder his father and marry his mother. At a crossroads, Oedipus comes to blows with other travelers and unwittingly kills his father, Laius, King of Thebes. After conquering the Sphinx, Oedipus enters Thebes and claims the prize of marrying Queen Jocasta. Again, he unwittingly fulfills the Oracle's prophecy and, in marrying the Queen, marries his mother. After having four children with his mother, everything is brought to light. Jocasta hangs herself and Oedipus blinds himself with his mother's brooch. The Voice finishes with: \\"Before you is a fully wound machine. Slowly its spring will unwind the entire span of a human life. It is one of the most perfect machines devised by the infernal gods for the mathematical annihilation of a mortal.\\"  Act I: The Ghost  While guarding the walls of Thebes, the two soldiers discuss the matter of the Sphinx and what it may be. They continue to their sighting of the Ghost of King Laius, when the Officer arrives. The Officer questions the two about the ghost sighting and leaves them to their duties. Tiresias and Jocasta enter and question the soldiers about the ghost sighting as well. As Jocasta begins to believe more and more, the ghost of King Laius appears. Despite his calls for his wife, he cannot be seen or heard by anyone else. After the cock crows in the dawn, Tiresias and Jocasta exit. After the two leave stage, the ghost of King Laius becomes audible and visible to the two soldiers. Laius struggles, apparently against the gods, to warn the soldiers about Oedipus's and Jocasta's impending doom, but disappears just as he is about to deliver the warning.  Act II: The Sphinx  The Voice tells us that what is about to happen in Act II happens concurrently with the events in Act I. The Sphinx, disguised as a beautiful girl, and Anubis sit in the outskirts of Thebes arguing about whether they have heard the first or second trumpet call, signalling that the gates of the city have been closed. The Sphinx declares she does not want to kill anymore, but Anubis cautions they must remain obedient to the gods. A mother and her two children cross the Sphinx's path while Anubis hides. The Sphinx and the unwitting mother discuss the situation in Thebes due to the Sphinx, and how some believe the Sphinx is a fabricated tale to act as a scapegoat for the problems in the city. It is revealed that the mother had another son who was killed by the Sphinx. As the mother and her children exit, the second trumpet sounds. Anubis says the Sphinx must stay until the third trumpet blast. At this point, Oedipus enters, while Anubis hides again. The Sphinx and Oedipus discuss the Sphinx and Oedipus' journey thus far. The Sphinx reveals herself to Oedipus, and before asking him the riddle tells him the answer. The Sphinx officially asks Oedipus the riddle, to which he correctly replies, resulting in the death of the Sphinx. As proof of his victory, Oedipus takes the fused head of Anubis and the body of the Sphinx to Thebes to claim his reward.  Act III: The Wedding Night  The Voice tells us that Oedipus and Jocasta have been married and are now alone in their bridal chamber. Both Oedipus and Jocasta are exhausted from the day of wedding ceremonies. Before it is consummated, Tiresias comes to tell Oedipus he is apprehensive about the marriage. Oedipus is affronted and takes Tiresias by the throat. He peers into the High Priest's eyes and sees his future with Jocasta being healthy and content. Before he sees any further, he is temporarily blinded, presumably by the gods. Oedipus regains his sight, apologizes to Tiresias and reveals that he is the only son of Polybus and Merope of Corinth. Jocasta enters after Tiresias's exit, and the couple discuss the night Jocasta investigated the ghost of King Laius. Oedipus has a nightmare of Anubis attacking him in his sleep, and Jocasta soothes him in an ironically maternal fashion.  Act IV: The King  A messenger from Corinth brings Oedipus news that his father, King Polybus, has died, and his mother Queen Merope is too senile to understand. As well, the messenger tells Oedipus that he was adopted, while Oedipus reveals he killed a man in a carriage many years past. After hearing that Oedipus was adopted, Jocasta exits, while Oedipus processes the new information. When he leaves to talk to his wife, he finds Jocasta having committed suicide. It is revealed that Oedipus is the son of Laius and Jocasta. Antigone enters and says that her mother is dead and that her father has stabbed his eyes. Oedipus sees the ghost of Jocasta, who leads Oedipus offstage. Departure from Sophocles The New York Times referred to The Infernal Machine as having taken, \\"...characters familiar from Greek tragedy off their pedestals and wittily humanized them while remaining true to Sophocles's plot. Oedipus, instead of a tragic hero, is a cocky, virginal youth whose arrogance is matched by his colossal naïveté. The relationship of Oedipus and Jocasta is treated as an extended Freudian joke. A vain, insecure woman obsessed with age, Jocasta has an eye for handsome young men, while Oedipus is drawn to older women who will cradle him like a child.\\" Stephen Holden, \\"Review: Cocteau's Humanized Oedipus\\", The New York Times, 2 Dec. 1990. Accessed 1 July 2015. Connection to Hamlet In a Modern Drama article, \\"The Infernal Machine, Hamlet, and Ernest Jones\\", Alberta E. Feynman claims that while writing, Cocteau not only referred to the original text of Sophocles, but to William Shakespeare's Hamlet. Feynman holds, \\"In constructing this new version, Cocteau drew chiefly, but not solely, upon the original myth. He fused the myth of Oedipus with that of another great tragic hero — Hamlet.\\" Several similarities exist between the two plays, including each play opening on the walls of a city, striking similarities between the character of Tiresias and Polonius, and according to Hamlet and Oedipus by Ernest Jones, \\"Both authors — Cocteau and Shakespeare...depict protagonists driven by the mechanism of the Oedipus complex.

As late as 1922, at the time of his death, he could be described as \\"the most famous association football forward of all time\\", and certainly – in the words of his Times obituary – \\"the most individually brilliant dribbler, the player who could most often put in those thrusts that no skill could parry\\". Early life and education Nevill was born in Long Melford, England, the son of a vicar,Edward Augustus Cobbold of the Cobbold family. \\"Nuts\\" was educated at Charterhouse School, one of the great nurseries of the association game, and Jesus College, Cambridge. As well as playing for the village team, he represented Cambridge University, Old Carthusians, and the Corinthians. While at university, Cobbold played in four consecutive varsity matches against Oxford University, winning each of them. His nickname, given to him during his time at school, was awarded – thought C.B. Fry – \\"possibly because he was the very best Kentish cob quality, all kernel and extremely hard to crack.\\" Playing style and reputation Cobbold starred on his international debut in England's 7–0 demolition of Ireland in February 1883, scoring twice in three minutes, and was frequently described as the trickiest and most elegant forward in the world at this time. \\"If one were to ask, Who were the three greatest forwards of all time?\\" wrote William Pickford and Alfred Gibson in 1906, \\"no matter what other two were named, W.N. Cobbold would perhaps come first to the lips.\\" Playing generally at inside left, \\"Nuts\\" was considered to have the ideal build for a striker of his period. \\"The best type of forward player,\\" wrote Montague Shearman in 1887, \\"is the fast, sturdy man of medium height, like W.N. Cobbold the Cantab.\\" It was true, Pickford and Gibson went on, that Cobbold was pre-eminently an old-style dribbling forward, who had learned his football in the years before the advent of the \\"combination\\" (passing) game at the end of the 1870s: \\"In those days 'dribbling' was the great game, and one only passed the ball when one was completely hemmed in, and not always even then.\\" But \\"Nuts\\" was far more than a mere dribbler, the authors stressed: :\\"He was essentially a scoring forward, and one, too, that made most of his own chances. One could not, for instance, conceive a greater contrast in style than Cobbold and Bloomer, both inside forwards. The former was almost continuously on the ball, while the Derby man seems to be doing nothing, and doing it well, for the greater part of the game. When Cobbold got possession of the ball he seemed to keep it glued to his toe, darting hither and thither as he pursued a tortuous course towards goal. One man was practically powerless to stop him. Two men might stay his career by dividing their attentions between the man and the ball, but they were not always successful even then. Very frequently Cobbold would shoulder his way through a whole crowd of the opposition and emerge triumphant with the ball at his toe. He was built for hard, strenuous play.\\" G.O. Smith, the great centre forward who followed Cobbold to Charterhouse and into the England team, concurred with Pickford and Gibson, recalling \\"Nuts\\" in April 1943 with the comment: \\"I put him first among all the forwards I have known.\\" Smith's verdict – coming from a noted student of the game and a man who had played with and against strikers of the calibre of Steve Bloomer and Billy Meredith – may be considered to restore the now almost entirely forgotten Cobbold firmly to the foremost ranks of footballers of all periods. Cobbold's other great attribute was his speed. In his prime he was a considerable sprinter, his obituary in The Times recalling: \\"Who that ever saw him speeding away down Parker's Piece will ever forget it? He was extraordinarily hard to stop and extremely fast.\\" Although in essence a one-paced player, lacking the ability – so conspicuously displayed by Stanley Matthews – to stop, start and accelerate, Cobbold nonetheless possessed the exceptional ball control required to make him a most daunting opponent. \\"No man that ever played,\\" wrote Pickford and Gibson, \\"could control the ball so effectively as Cobbold could when travelling at full speed... [He was] inimitable, the finest and fastest dribbler the Association game has known.\\" To his abilities as a runner and a dribbler, moreover, must be added great prowess as a goalscorer. Cobbold was renowned for his marksmanship, and it was commented that, given two feet of goal to aim at, \\"Nuts\\" would invariably hit the target. The striker had, most contemporaries agreed, one of the fiercest shots yet seen. \\"He could shoot in any position,\\" was the verdict of Pickford and Gibson, \\"and he sent the ball in like a charge from a hundred-ton gun.\\" Cobbold anticipated the professional game in one respect (noted Edward Grayson, the historian of the early amateurs), \\"for in order to avoid getting hurt, he turned out swathed in rubber bandages and ankle guards.\\" He belonged, nonetheless, resolutely to the earliest period of Association Football, disdaining – in common with many footballers of his generation – the aerial game, then regarded as a novel and distasteful innovation, and \\"eliminating all heading from his play.\\" \\"Nuts\\" also declined to modify his dribbling style with the advent of new tactics for \\"passing forward\\" in the early 1880s – partly, speculated Pickford and Gibson, \\"because in his day they had not been sufficiently developed and partly because he himself was a man of infinite resource.\\" Those who had seen the player in his prime sometimes debated how \\"Nuts\\" would have fared against the better organised defences of the 1890s. \\"The chances,\\" Gibson and Pickford concluded in their assessment, \\"are that against three of our strongest half- backs he would have had to considerably modify his methods.\\" Cobbold accumulated a total of nine England caps, a good number at a time when only three international matches were played each year, scoring six England goals in total. His final international appearance came in a narrow March 1887 defeat to Scotland. Other sports and later life Although regarded by his friend G.O. Smith as scarcely in the first rank of cricketers, Cobbold played once for Kent, scoring four runs, and, after his retirement from football, persisted with cricket and took up golf. Playing against lesser opposition \\"Nuts\\" could be a formidable batsman; the first wicket partnership of 440 runs he notched with WR Gray for West Wratting, a small village in Cambridgeshire, against Fitzwilliam Hostel in 1891 remains, more than a century later, among the ten highest ever recorded in minor cricket. In later life he was a schoolteacher, working principally as a \\"crammer\\" who specialised in preparing boys for entrance to the British Army. Cobbold suffered considerably from ill health in the years leading to his death – problems his obituarist attributed to his capacity for sheer hard work. He died at West Wratting.

It is made up of an artificial island and is located right across from the Kremlin between the Moskva River and its old riverbed, which was turned into the Vodootvodny Canal in 1786. It does not have any historical, official or established name. In the relevant sources it is referred to simply as the Island. The island a part of the historical Zamoskvorechye area. The island itself was split into four localities: Bersenevka (), Boloto (, swamp), Balchug (), Sadovniki (, after the gardens). Despite the lack of the name proper in some popular publications the island called either after one of these localities: Balchug, Bolotny, Sadovnicheskiy or due to its proximity to the Kremlin as Kremlevskiy or due to its land value as Zolotoy (after gold) or simply Bezymyanniy (nameless).ЛЕГЕНДЫ О МОСКВЕ.

(left), Central Bank building (right) This section is based on P.V.Sytin's \\"History of Moscow Streets\\" (1948) Balchug is one of the oldest Moscow streets outside of the Kremlin walls. It emerged towards the end of the 14th century, when the new Kremlin built by Dmitri Donskoi pushed the posad settlement into what is known today as the Red Square as well as areas further east. The main trading road to the south and the river crossing also moved to the east, to present-day Balchug and Pyatnitskaya streets. The name Balchug comes from Tatar balčyk, meaning \\"dirt\\" or \\"mud\\". Muddy conditions in the area were caused by migrations of the river bed, frequent floods, and inadequate drainage. In the 15th century, Prince Vasili I set up royal gardens west of Balchug Street across from the Kremlin. The gardeners settled east of Balchug, giving its name to the Sadovniki neighborhood and present-day Sadovnicheskaya Street. They set up flood control moats connecting River Moskva with the old riverbed. Memories of those medieval moats—rovushki and endovy in Old Russian—survive in the names of Raushskaya Embankment and St. George Church \\"v Endove\\" (1653). One moat was just 50 meters east of Balchug Street and survived until the 1850s. Eventually, as the city grew south into Zamoskvorechye, Balchug became a market street, with butchers, bakers, inns, and public baths, according to tax records from 1669. In 1701, the Gardens and Balchug were swept by fire; another fire followed in 1730. The market reappeared each time, but in 1735 the government relocated the butchers beyond the city limits; by 1744 the market was selling mostly horses. 1783 flood destroyed most of Balchug and Sadovniki, including the St. George bell tower. By 1786, the city built the original Vodootvodny Canal, a flood control dike following the old river bed. The first metal bridge in Moscow, Chugunny Bridge (1830), connected Balchug with the Zamoskvorechye mainland. A steel bridge north, to Red Square and Zaryadye, was completed in 1872. Until the 1930s, Balchug remained a street of two-story shops; the only four-story building belonged to the Novomoskovskaya Hotel (now the ). Construction of the new Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge (1938) changed the street's status again. The main north-south artery moved west, bypassing Balchug. Houses between the bridge and Balchug street were razed (the northern end of this site remains vacant). What was left in the 1930s was destroyed in the 1990s. First, the old Balchug Hotel was built out from 4 to 9 stories high, then a Central Bank building replaced the few surviving buildings between the bridge and Balchug. One 19th century single-story building remains as a facade curtain for a nine-story office block (see facadism). Vodootvodny Canal 1739 map, before the Canal. River level shown at a summer low: old river bed dried out, leaving isolated patches of mud. White fields near the rivers are the uninhabited floodlands In 1692 Bolshoi Kamenny Bridge, the first permanent bridge in the city, linked Zamoskvorechye with the city to the north. Four years later, Russia's first triumphal arch was built in front of the bridge in order to welcome Peter I's return from the Azov campaigns. In 1783, the area was swept away by a severe flood that damaged the bridge; in order to repair it, the Moskva River was temporarily drained, while its old riverbed was reconstructed into the four-kilometer-long Vodootvodny Canal (English: \\"Water Bypass Channel\\"), which is now spanned by ten bridges.  Kazakov's developments  The first documented project was drawn in 1775, presumably by Matvey Kazakov (senior). In addition to separating Balchug Island from Zamoskvorechye, he proposed cutting two flood control dikes west of Bersenevka to create two more islands. In the east, he planned to flood uninhabited farmland and connect the canal to Moskva River inside the present-day Garden Ring; the island's east would also serve as the city's grain port and warehouse. The moat east of Balchug had to be cleared and widened, too. This plan was implemented in between 1783 and 1786 (the grain terminal was never built). An 1807 plan shows only one additional island west of Bersenevka; otherwise, it follows Kazakov's project, with the main island cut into two halves by the Balchug moat.

The canal's eastern end was also reduced to its original width of 30 meters. In 1835, the city built the Babyegorodskaya Dam west of the island, which enabled barge shipping up the canal. A new channel extension east was built to bypass the old 90-degree turn; as the 1853 map shows, the new canal cut the Red Hills neighborhood away from the mainland. For a while, the island was cut into three parts, then, when the Balchug moat was filled, in two. The moat parallel to the Garden Ring was filled in the 1930s when the Bolshoy Krasnokholmsky Bridge was completed. Neighborhoods Four pairs of bridges (Bolshoy Kamenny, Moskvoretsky, Ustinsky, Krasnokholmsky over the Moskva River and their lesser siblings over the Canal) cut the island into five distinct parts. In addition to the bridges listed above, the island is connected to the Zamoskvorechye mainland by two road and four pedestrian bridges over the Vodootvodny Canal; an extension of Patriarshy Bridge is under construction, scheduled for completion at the end of 2007. The City announced plans to build a pedestrian bridge across the Moskva River in Red Hills, but no draft had been published as of 2007. Bersenevka House on Embankment, 1927-1931, as seen from Patriarshy Bridge. Averky Kirillov estate, right Bersenevka, the oldest part of the island, boasts architectural diversity with buildings such as the Averky Kirillov estate (1650s, rebuilt 1703–1711), including the manor house, and the St. Nicholas Church. The river banks are dominated by the red-brick buildings of the former Krasny Oktyabr chocolate factory (north) and the yellow Second Powerplant. The grey House on Embankment, facing east, houses two theaters. City planners have been considering converting Bersenevka industrial buildings into an upscale hotel and condominium. The work accelerated when the Guta Development was hired to manage the project. Boloto British Embassy in Boloto, facing Kremlin Boloto, in Russian, is literally \\"swamp\\". The territory was occupied by royal gardens until 1701. Later, it was cleared for a parade ground and witnessed a number of public executions, including that of Emelyan Pugachev and his fellow Cossack rebels on . Despite the unprepossessing name, Boloto was home to some of the finest mansions. One, owned by industrialist Gustav List, eventually became the British Embassy. In the 1890s, Moscow started a public housing experiment that led to the construction of block-wide apartment houses, one of which now serves as Rosneft's headquarters. The city had plans to rebuild the low-rise Boloto but as of 2007, they had not materialized. Many historical houses have been evacuated and have stood unattended for years. Bolotnaya Square, which faces the canal, contains Mikhail Chemiakin's controversial sculptures that personify human vice.  Balchug  Balchug is the short stretch between Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge and Bolshoy Ustinsky Bridge, including Balchug Street and the beginning of Sadovnicheskaya Street), is the densest area of the island. It houses Moscow's first electrical powerplant (still active); offices are occupied by electrical (Mosenergo) and oil companies.  Sadovniki East  Sadovniki East, Gershwin school of music Sadovniki East refers to a mixed neighborhood of residential, educational, and industrial buildings on Sadovnicheskaya Street. It retained most of the traditional Zamoskvorechye air. The recent wave of development replaced the old textile mill with a block-sized office compound. Other than that, the 19th-century architecture remains remarkably well preserved. Sadovniki also possess two 1930s memorial buildings, the constructivist Textile Institute (1938) and postconstructivist School 518, recently rebuilt to the original 1935 drafts but in compliance with modern safety rules.  Red Hills  Prior to the 1938 construction of Bolshoy Krasnokholmsky Bridge, Red Hills was separated from the island by a narrow canal running just outside the Garden Ring (see 1853 map). As recently as 15 years ago, the eastern tip of the island was occupied by low-rise industrial buildings, but they were torn down and replaced by offices, a hotel tower (2006), and the Moscow International House of Music (2003).

History  The studio was founded in July 1915 by Harry and Roy Aitken, two brothers from the Wisconsin farmlands who pioneered the studio system of Hollywood's Golden Age. Harry was also D. W. Griffith's partner at Reliance-Majestic Studios; both parted with the Mutual Film Corporation in the wake of The Birth of a Nation unexpected success that year. Triangle was envisioned as a prestige studio based on the producing abilities of filmmakers D. W. Griffith, Thomas Ince and Mack Sennett. On November 23, 1915, the Triangle Film Corporation opened a state- of-the-art motion picture theater in Massillon, Ohio. The Lincoln Theater is still an operational movie theater owned and operated by the Massillon Lion's Club. The theater has been restored and is host to a yearly film festival dedicated to the films of Dorothy and Lillian Gish. Eventually, the studio suffered from bloat. By 1917, producer Adolph Zukor had taken control of all of the studio's assets. In June 1917, Thomas H. Ince and Mack Sennett left the company and sold their remaining interests. Triangle's distribution network of film exchanges were sold off to the W.W. Hodkinson company for $600,000Lombardi p.74 (). Triangle continued to produce films until 1919, when it ceased operations.

Athol Murray College of Notre Dame is committed to developing young men and women to become purposeful leaders with virtuous character. Athol Murray College of Notre Dame is located in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, Canada. It was founded by the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis in 1920 as St. Augustine school when they established Notre Dame of the Prairies Convent. The school was later renamed to honour the contributions of Father Athol Murray. A noted, stained glass window honours 67 of the college's alumni who died in World War II. History In 1920, the Sisters of Charity of St. Louis opened the Notre Dame of the Prairies Convent and St. Augustine's residential elementary and high school for boys and girls at Wilcox, Saskatchewan; a small town on the Canadian prairies south of Regina – the provincial capital. Father Athol Murray was appointed to St. Augustine's parish in Wilcox, Saskatchewan, in 1927. The institution's name was eventually changed to honour his contributions. In the beginning, the College had no running water or central heating. In 1930, fees were $18 per month, but many students couldn't afford to pay. Père (Father) Murray accepted students on the basis that they desired an education, not on their ability to pay. A side of beef, a chicken, a bucket of coal and produce were often accepted instead of money. Students came from everywhere and from every type of social, cultural and religious background. Murray was assisted by Sister Mary Edith McCullough. Her teaching career spanned 30 years at Wilcox. Sr. Edith ran the elementary and high schools while Père spent most of his time with the students in the Arts programs. In 1933, Père Murray succeeded in obtaining an official affiliation with the University of Ottawa. Père Murray believed in the Greek philosophy of developing the mind, body and spirit and envisioned a school that could develop great scholars and athletes through equal emphasis on the disciplines of academics, athletics and faith. Notre Dame's longstanding success in developing well-balanced individuals is a testament to that vision. Though Murray died in 1975, his legacy lives on. Père's beloved Notre Dame College continues to produce many of North America's finest student athletes through a balanced program that emphasizes the values of good character, leadership and community living. Père's motto \\"Luctor et Emergo\\" (Struggle and Emerge) is still reinforced today. The Institute for Stained Glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at Athol Murray College of Notre Dame. Dedicated to 67 ex-students of Notre Dame College who served and died during World War II; the stained glass window by Colonial Studios, Ottawa, circa 1948 depicts St. Augustine. Athletics Andrew Scheer with the Hounds of Athol Murray College In addition to its academic programs, the College has many sports teams that the students play on. The most notable are the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League's Notre Dame Hounds. There are also a number of minor hockey teams playing under the SHA banner, as well as members of the Canadian Sport School Hockey League (CSSHL). Notre Dame currently fields three midget 'AAA' teams: two male teams (the Hounds and the Argos), and one female team (the Hounds). The midget 'AAA' program has won a total of five national championships: four on the male side and one on the female side. Former Tampa Bay Lightning forwards Vincent Lecavalier and Brad Richards played together in the school's AAA Bantam program, while numerous others have gone on to be drafted into the NHL. Notre Dame also runs high school athletics programs in basketball, rugby, football, soccer, volleyball, baseball, softball, track and field and wrestling.

They also sing a \\"Prayer And Victory March\\" after every athletic competition. This song is derived partly from early Hounds and also contains the later part of the University of Notre Dame's fight song, due to the contributions toward Père's Tower of God by a Notre Dame alumni. The Prayer and Victory March \\"Dear Notre Dame, We hail the Alma Mater. Thy loyal sons, Thy banners proudly bear. We pledge to thee, Our love and our devotion, We beg thee hear and grant our prayers. Oh guide our steps, And lead us safely onward, Through all the years, With love and care.

It was released as The Green Ray in the UK and as Summer in North America, but is not part of Rohmer's Four Seasons series. Rather, it is the fifth film of his Comedies and Proverbs. The film was inspired by the novel of the same name by Jules Verne. It was shot in France on 16mm film and much of the dialogue is improvised. The film won the Golden Lion and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Venice Film Festival. Plot The movie opens at the start of Delphine's summer vacation. Delphine has just suffered the breakup of a relationship and her traveling companion has ditched her so that her new boyfriend can accompany her to Greece instead. She is left without plans at a time when Paris is emptying for the summer. Another friend invites Delphine to join a beach party for the weekend, but she finds that she's the only one amongst the group who is single so she quickly returns to Paris. Her family pressures her to spend the holidays with them in Ireland, but she resists. She travels alone to the Alps, but is put off by hordes of vacationers and turns around. Traveling restlessly, the theme of the movie (characterized by Roger Ebert) becomes clear: Delphine \\"is incapable of playing the dumb singles games that lead to one-night stands.\\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/summer-1986 She meets a new girlfriend, who flirts with two young men, and she flees in anger. She recoils from the pre-packaged lines of the guys she meets in bars and on trains. She simply cannot engage in that kind of mindless double-talk any longer. Beneath her boredom is genuine anger at the roles that single women are sometimes expected to play. While in Biarritz she eavesdrops on a conversation about Jules Verne's novel Le Rayon Vert (The Green Ray). According to Verne, when one sees a rare green flash at sunset, one's own thoughts and those of others are revealed as if by magic.

The fifth of the series was The Green Ray in 1986. The theme was a phrase from Rimbaud: \\"Ah! que le temps vienne où les cœurs s'éprennent\\" (\\"Oh! May the time come when hearts fall in love\\"). Rohmer explained that \\"I was struck by the naturalness of television interviews. You can say that here, nature is perfect. If you look for it, you find it because people forget the cameras.\\" As was becoming his custom in pre-production, Rohmer gathered his cast together to discuss the project and their characters, but then allowed each actor to invent their own dialogue. Rohmer stated that lead actress Marie Rivière \\"is the one who called the shots, not only by what she said, but by the way she'd speak, the way she'd question people, and also by the questions her character evoked from the others.\\" The film was shot chronologically and in 16mm so as to be \\"as inconspicuous as possible, to have Delphine blend into the crowd as a way, ultimately, of accentuating her isolation.\\" Rohmer also instructed his cinematographer Sophie Maintigneux to keep technical aspects of the shoot to a minimum so as to not interrupt or distract the actors. The film's only major expense was a trip to the Canary Islands in order to film the green rays there. Rohmer chose to premiere the film on Canal Plus TV, a pay-TV station that paid $130,000 for the film, which was only one fifth of its budget. Rohmer stated that \\"Cinema here will survive only because of television. Without such an alliance we won't be able to afford French films.\\" The experiment paid off when the film was a theatrical hit after being released three days after its initial broadcast. Reception The Green Ray won the Golden Lion and the FIPRESCI Prize at the 1986 Venice Film Festival. It was mostly praised by film critics, although Alain Robbe-Grillet wrote an unfavorable review and stated \\"I didn't like it very much.\\"John Wakeman, World Film Directors, Volume 2, 1945–1985. New York: H. W. Wilson, 1988. pp. 919-928. In the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made, The Green Ray made the top-10 lists of six critics and three directors.

On 1 January 1847 a half-mile connecting line to the Wicker station of the Midland Railway had been constructed in order to increase goods traffic and enable wagon transfers. This short steeply graded line, enclosed within a tunnel for almost its entire length was known locally as the Fiery Jack. By this time the railway operating company had become the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, which in 1899 became the Great Central Railway. From 1851 Bridgehouses became the company's terminal for goods and cattle traffic. It remained open for freight until 1965. The station was approached by a ramp from Nursery Street and on the opposite corner a public house was built. Originally named \\"The Manchester Railway Hotel\\" its frontage was damaged in the Sheffield Flood of 1864 and was rebuilt (look at the alignment to the main building). It was renamed \\"The Manchester Hotel\\" and in spring 2006, after a short period of closure, it became \\"The Harlequin\\", taking the name from a recently demolished pub which stood a short distance away in Johnson Street. Part of the station site is now used as a car park and part of the retaining wall along Nursery Street has been demolished to make way for the northern section of Sheffield's Inner Ring Road. It has been suggested that this retaining wall might have contained stones from Sheffield Castle. West portal of Bridgehouses Tunnel, which lay east of the station Before the building of the \\"Borough Bridge\\", which carries Corporation Street across the River Don to reach Nursery Street, passenger access to the station from the city area was by a footbridge, depicted by an unknown artist, . On the night of 11 March 1864, when the waters of the Great Sheffield flood poured over the bridge, a vast quantity of timber and debris came down with the force of a battering ram, and carried the footbridge away. A successor to this bridge is still standing adjacent to the new bridge which carries the Inner Ring Road over the River Don, although it is in need of restoration. The terminal was the subject of a BBC local television documentary \\"Engines must not enter the potato siding\\" which contained vintage film and memories from former railway workers and which was broadcast in November 1969 at the time of the rationalisation of goods traffic in the Sheffield area and the opening of the new Sheffield Freight Terminal in Brightside Lane. This was adjacent to the site of the former Midland Railway locomotive sheds and yard. The potato siding was situated high above the road and had a wooden floor, fine for wagons and vans but as the title says, not locomotives.  The last mystery  The building of the Sheffield Inner Ring Road (Derek Dooley Way) through the site took away the last remains of the yard but left one mystery, the unsolved murder of Sheffield prostitute Michaela Hague. She was working in the area on 5 November 2001 when she picked up a customer in a car and went to the Bridgehouses station site. She was killed in a frenzied knife attack and although found by police alive, she died later in hospital.\\"The Star\\", 6 November 2001 ReferencesExternal links * 'Engines Must Not Enter The Potato siding' on YouTube Category:Disused railway stations in Sheffield Category:Former Great Central Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1845 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1851 Category:Woodhead Line Category:1845 establishments in England ","title":"Bridgehouses railway station"},{"id":"4423172","text":"Buchlyvie is a village in the Stirling council area of Scotland.

The Resort Master Plan (a Planned Unit Development) is permitted for a total of 2,043 dwelling units, including single-family lots, townhomes, condominiums, hotel and conference facilities.  History  The Tamarack Resort was first conceived as Valbois in the early 1980s, but unsuccessfully struggled to overcome federal regulatory hurdles and fierce local opposition, and finally folded in 1995. Despite local opposition, a new group of investors revived the project three years later with modifications and called it WestRock. After four years the name was changed to \\"Tamarack\\" in December 2002, after the tamarack larch, a deciduous coniferous tree, whose short, dark green fir-like needles turn yellow (and shed) every autumn. Construction at the Tamarack Resort began in 2003, and skiing was available only by snowcat the first year. The alpine ski area officially opened with chairlift service the following year on December 15, 2004. The Resort went through foreclosure and emerged from it at a sheriff's sale on March 10, 2014. A court-appointed receiver, Douglas Wilson, closed the ski area in early March 2009, which was shuttered for the 2009-10 season. It re-opened in 2010 on December 20, with five of seven chairlifts, operated by the Tamarack Municipal Association (TMA). All major recreational and dining facilities were restarted under TMA management, except the zip line tour which was operated by Experience Based Learning, Inc out of Rockford, IL, under the /dba/ Zip Tamarack, from July 2009 until September 2016. One of the three high-speed chairlifts was removed in 2012.  Golf  Osprey Meadows, a Robert Trent Jones II signature 18-hole golf course, opened in May 2006 with the addition of the back nine holes; the first nine holes opened for play in September 2005.

Meanwhile, Credit Suisse continued to move in Idaho state court to foreclose on the resort property. The state court is charged with determining which creditors are entitled to the real estate and their priority, but federal court will handle the disposition of the real estate and other assets.idahostatesman.com - \\"Tamarack bankruptcy case moves forward\\" - Associated Press - 2010-03-19 The bankruptcy case was dismissed in early January 2011, and all litigation was returned to state court foreclosure proceedings.

Prior to Tamarack most recent failure of a major North American ski resort had been by Stagecoach in 1974, located about south of Steamboat Springs, Colorado. Stagecoach failed after its second ski season, and has slowly grown as a residential and vacation community, primarily due to the addition of a dam and reservoir in 1988. Some Tamarack property owners are now part of a multibillion-dollar lawsuit with lender Credit Suisse led by bankrupt Yellowstone Club founder Timothy Blixseth and his son Beau Blixseth who claim Tamarack's bankruptcy was caused by a \\"loan to own\\" scheme between the bank and resort developers.Luxury-Property Owners Sue Credit Suisse for $24 Billion, by Jaqueline Palank, The Wall Street Journal, January 5, 2010.  Re- opening  The Tamarack Municipal Association reopened skiing at the resort on December 20, 2010. Funded by the association directly and the proceeds from lift ticket, season pass, and food service sales, Tamarack hired nearly 100 employees to staff five of the resort's seven chairlifts servicing 60% to 70% of the resort's skiable terrain. The \\"Wildwood Express\\" and \\"Buttercup/Whitewater\\" chairs did not operate, as they are currently the subject of a lawsuit by Bank of America. Operating on a Thursday-Sunday limited schedule, plus holidays Tamarack sold season pass and lift ticket sales starting at $46 for a single-day adult lift ticket and $199 for an unlimited adult season pass. Food service is available, serving traditional ski area fare. Limited fine dining is also available. $250,000 have already been contributed by homeowners and $1.5 million in ticket sales are expected in order to meet a $500,000 payroll. With season pass sales already started for the 2011-2012 ski season, the Tamarack Municipal Association plans on opening the resort on December 15, 2011. The \\"Wildwood Express\\" chairlift, installed in 2005 and last operated in 2009, was removed in June 2012. The ski operation lost nearly $300,000 during the 2011-12 season. In June 2016, Tamarack opened the Mountain Bike park with lift service on weekends.

Its main stock includes over 180,000 units and the museum library houses over 10,000 volumes of scientific literature and periodicals. History The Pleven Regional Historical Museum has its roots in the local Archaeological Society founded in 1903, the goals of which included the creation of a museum, as well as the discovery and research of historical monuments in the town and the region. The first excavations of the Roman fortress of Storgosia in Kaylaka Park in May 1905 were organized and carried out by the society under the direction of Yurdan Kantardzhiev. A museum collection that exhibited the items found was assembled by the society in 1911. In 1923, all the materials were moved to the Saglasie Community Centre, where a museum was established. Officially founded in 1953, the museum moved to its current edifice, built between 1884 and 1888 after an Italian project for barracks, in 1984. The museum became regional on 1 July 2000, embracing the provinces of Pleven and Lovech.

Route=Belfast From , the line crosses the River Lagan on the Lagan Viaduct, branches from the Bangor line, recrosses the Lagan parallel to the M3 motorway on the Dargan Bridge and reaches its first stop, Yorkgate, which replaced the former York Road terminus in 1992. Parallel to the dual five-lane M2 motorway (once the UK's widest), the line now heads northeast, past the main Northern Ireland Railways engineering depot and engine sheds, along the coast towards Whitehouse, a former halt. The line then continues north along the coast of Belfast Lough. Whiteabbey At Whiteabbey, the line enters a cutting and climbs towards Bleach Green Junction. The station is long gone here too (1977), but the lines diverge here, with the Londonderry line continuing to Mossley West and Antrim. The next stops – Jordanstown (University of Ulster, level crossing), Greenisland (former junction) and Trooperslane (level crossing) – are still a few hundred yards inland, and Belfast Lough can be seen from time to time where development is sparse. After Trooperslane, the line passes through a former halt at Mount. This station was closed in the early 1970s. Carrickfergus Carrickfergus town still has three stations, Clipperstown, Carrickfergus and Downshire. The former halt at Barn has been closed since 1977 (around the same time as Bleach Green Halt). At Downshire bridge the line crosses the A2 road once more and from here north, it follows the coastline at low level, offering views over the lough towards County Down and the Copeland Islands. Downshire From Downshire, the line runs through a former halt at Eden. The station here was closed back in 1977(similar to Barn And Bleach Green Stations). Erosion has effected maintenance along this section, and the line singles now at Kilroot (closed halt, power station) where previously it carried on as double track to Whitehead. The outer up track has been removed (officially temporarily) for safety reasons. At Whitehead Station, there is a passing loop and a spur to the former Excursion Station which is the headquarters of the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. Larne Then north to Larne as single track, there are three intermediate halts, Ballycarry, Magheramorne, and Glynn, each serving villages en route. On the coastal side, the peninsula of Islandmagee blocks views of Scotland, but forms the wildlife wetlands of Larne Lough. Small sections of the track at the Larne end are built on causeways, forming ponds landside of the railway. On entering the town, the railway again crosses the road inland to Larne Town station before reaching its terminus at Larne Harbour station, sharing its building with the ferry terminal for the Port of Larne. Services On weekdays, trains run half-hourly from , with the outbound terminus alternating every half an hour between and . Extra services operate at peak times to and from . Evening services are reduced to hourly operation after 8pm between Larne Harbour and Great Victoria Street and the last trains of the day in each direction typically at around 11:20pm only operate to or from Lanyon Place.

This monastery is located in the northwestern town of St. Augustine in Tunapuna–Piarco in Trinidad and Tobago.The Benedictine Order was founded by Saint Benedict of Nursia who wrote The Rule of Saint Benedict followed by all Benedictines. The Motto of the Order is Ora Et Labora, 'Pray and Work'. Benedict, born in 480 in Nursia, Italy, was sent by his family to Rome to study law. Revolted by the immoral atmosphere of the city, he decided to become a hermit, spending his days in seclusion and prayer. Eventually, Benedict gained a following and established the Benedictine order.  History  Mount Saint Benedict Abbey was established in 1912 on 240 acres of land approximately 4300 feet above sea level, purchased by Dom Mayeul De Caigny, a Brazilian Benedictine monk from Trinidadian Andrew Gomez. By June 27, 1912, the land was officially Benedictine property. The Archbishop of Port of Spain took offence to Dom Mayeul and his companions referring to Trinidad as \\"missionary territory\\". Don Mayeul was told that there were over 100,000 Hindus in Trinidad and hoped to focus his efforts on evangelizing these groups. Trinidad was, however, converted to Catholicism following its discovery by Christopher Columbus in the 1500s. On 6 October 1912, three monks arrived in Trinidad to establish the abbey: Dom Ambrose, Dom Paul and Dom Mayeul. The monks were welcomed by the nearby Parish of Arouca and were housed there until receiving more monks to begin construction of their property. On November 27, 1912, two more religious brothers were received: Brother Joseph Kleinmann and Brother Donatian Marcus. Brother Kleinmann, a carpenter, began to convert the small hut existing on the property into two rooms, an oratory, and a dormitory. Brother Kleinmann even went on to work on the challenge of bringing fresh water to the monastery. By laying down thousands of feet of pipe, this brother was able to bring water at the rate of five gallons per minutes from the Crown Lands ravine to the monastery. Soon, the Trinidadian people began to give the brothers furniture, cooking utensils, chickens, eggs, rice, and coffee. On July 24, 1913, a contractor, A.D. Degazon was hired to construct a road that would provide a safe path from the bottom of the hill to the building site. Mayeul was responsible for purchasing several pieces of equipment for the Monks such as automated machines to cut and prepare wood and \\"a motor-driven unit to generate electricity\\". The religious brothers were able to create the choir stall, flooring, and roofs for many of the buildings. The chapel structure stood at 68 by 21 feet, with the first Mass being celebrated on August 10, 1913.  The abbey today  Today, with its tower and red roofs, the abbey consists of a church, a monastery, a seminary, a drug rehabilitation center, a yogurt factory, and Pax Guest House, a place for retreat. The abbey welcomes and draws people of all faiths seeking peace, solace, purpose, and fulfillment. Mount Saint Benedict is currently presided over by Abbot John Pereira and houses ten monks.  The Pax House  Pax means peace in Latin. The Pax House is a guest house that was built in 1916 on the grounds of Mount Saint Benedict. It features views of the rising Northern Range to the north and the low lying Caroni plains of central Trinidad to the south. The House offers general tours of its grounds and guided bird watching tours. The House is also notable for its famous Tea Room which was built during World War II and is the oldest in the country. It operates for a few hours each afternoon serving a variety of international teas and items produced on the premises such as honey and bread.  Pax Yogurt Company  Yogurt has been made by the monks at Mount Saint Benedict since 1997 as a way to have a healthier diet. The monk who started to make the yogurt began to give some out to visitors and friends but it soon became a trend. People started to place orders and the monks realized that they had to think of a way to make more yogurt for the increased number of people who enjoyed eating it. The Pax Yogurt Company was started in April 2003 and now ships its products, in a variety of flavors, to supermarkets across the country. Hotels, \\"especially those with German guests\\", are also interested in getting yogurt deliveries.

The service is available in 73 territories. History Launched in the year 2000, Sony's second home console, the PlayStation 2, had rudimentary online features in select games via its online network. It required a network adaptor, which was available as an add-on for original models and integrated into the hardware on slimline models. However, Sony provided no unified service for the system, so support for network features was specific to each game and third-party server, and there was no interoperability of cross-game presence. Five years later during the development stage for its third home console, the PlayStation 3, Sony expressed their intent to build upon the functionality of its predecessor by creating a new interconnected service that keeps users constantly in touch with a \\"PlayStation World\\" network.Tor Thorsen. PlayStation 3 announced for 2006, GameSpot, May 16, 2005. In March 2006, Sony officially introduced its unified online service, tentatively named \\"PlayStation Network Platform\\".Hirohiko Niizumi. PlayStation Network Platform detailed, GameSpot, March 15, 2006. A list of supporting features was announced at the Tokyo Game Show later the same year. Sony launched an optional premium subscription service on top of the free PSN service in June 2010. Known as PlayStation Plus, the system provides access to exclusive content, complimentary games, regular store discounts, and early access to forthcoming games. Following a security intrusion, the PlayStation Network had a temporary suspension of operation which began on April 20, 2011 and affected 77 million registered accounts. Lasting 23 days, this outage was the longest amount of time the PSN had been offline since its inception in 2006. Sony reported that user data had been obtained during the intrusion. In June 2011, Sony launched a \\"Welcome Back\\" program following the outage, allowing all PSN subscribers who joined prior to April 20 to download two free PlayStation 3 titles and two free PlayStation Portable games. Users also received 30 free days of PlayStation Plus, while users who were already subscribed before the outage got 60 free days.Brett Molina, USA Today. \\"Sony launches 'Welcome Back' program for PSN users.\\" June 3, 2011.

After the disruption, Sony changed the PlayStation Network's license agreement to legally bar users from filing lawsuits and joining class action lawsuits without first trying to resolve issues with an arbitrator. In July 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment announced that they had acquired video game streaming service Gaikai for $380 million. The acquisition was later strengthened when Sony acquired the assets of Gaikai's market rival OnLive. At the Consumer Electronics Show in January 2014, Sony announced that Gaikai's technology would be used to power PlayStation Now; a new cloud-based gaming service that allows people to play PlayStation games on a variety of devices.

It can range from 3 to 16 characters in length and consist of letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores. A user's Online ID is central to your PSN profile and is displayed when playing online games and using other network features. In April 2019, Sony enabled users to change their online PSN ID. Users have the option to disclose their real name aside their Online ID, add a personal description, exhibit a profile picture or avatar, and list all spoken languages. Profiles also include a summary of a player's Trophy level and recent activity. Profiles can be viewed via the user interface or online through the PlayStation website. A Portable ID is a small infographic intended for use as a forum signature. The graphic showcases a user's trophy level and number of trophies awarded. Each user is able to log into their PSN account using a web browser to access and customize their Portable ID, and are then given a unique URL which they can cut & paste to display their ID elsewhere on the internet.Ed Easton.

Several third-party websites offer similar graphics (commonly referred to as \\"trophy cards\\") as both free and paid services which either update automatically or are updated manually by the user. Trophies Trophies are in-game awards presented to gamers for hitting specific targets or reaching certain milestones (e.g. completing a difficult level or defeating a certain number of enemies). There are four different types of trophy awarded. A bronze, silver, or gold trophy is contingent upon the difficulty of the accomplishment, with each reward contributing to a level system attached to a player's profile. A platinum trophy is awarded to the player once they unlock all other trophies in the base game; smaller sized games, however, generally do not have a platinum trophy. In addition, each trophy is graded by popularity—common, rare, very rare, and ultra rare—based on the percentage of people who have unlocked it. Developers can choose to make various trophies hidden so that its value and description are not revealed until after the user has obtained it.

Built in 1952, the site was home to the 31st Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron and was operational in its intended role until 1964, when the complex was sold to the provincial government of Ontario in November for CA$218,225 and was used as an Adult Occupational Centre for developmentally disabled or handicapped adults until its closure in 1999. The base consisted of 84 residences, two office buildings, a swimming pool, bowling alley, baseball diamond, hospital, church and a school. As a part of the deinstitutionalization program, the government began shutting down all its institutions and by 1999, the Edgar Adult Occupational Centre was completely shut down. The Ontario Provincial Police then assumed use of the old recreational hall for instruction. They had been using the base off and on for police training and a number of other functions. In 1999, the government attempted to sell the 628,300 m² (155¼ acre) site to Nishnawbe Homes for $2.95 million, an organization dedicated to building respectable communities for first-nations people, but this deal fell through. From its 1999 closure until its 2011 demolition, the base sat mostly unused, except for occasional use by military and police as a training centre, including being the rehab centre for Canada's Worst Driver 3 in 2007. Despite the site being idle, there is 24/7 security posted at the gatehouse making the site inaccessible to the public. In July 2011, a developer purchased the remainder of the property for $2,500 and by the fall of 2011, all the buildings had been demolished.

At the time of its production the show was variously compared to the series Thunderbirds, which was previously broadcast in South Africa in Afrikaans under the title Redding Internasionaal (International Rescue). The main plot involved an undercover planetary defense agency operating from Cape Town under the guise of an interstellar shipping company. The show mirrored the real world political issues of international isolation facing Apartheid South Africa with the Earth being depicted as a galactic pariah of the \\"Interplanetary League\\" due to its cold war with the planet \\"Krokon\\". The villain in the series was depicted by Prince Karnati or his evil henchmen. The spaceships used in the show were called Impalas after the South African Air Force aircraft, the locally assembled Italian Aermacchi MB-326. There was a pragmatic reason for calling the aircraft Impalas - the basis of the models were 1/48 scale plastic model kits of the AM326, so that they would be recognizable to South African youth. Plot The main characters were based in the city of Cape Town while enemies were aliens from a distant space system -- and were often viewed as representing black protagonists by journalists overseas. The entire series was produced in Afrikaans. Plot wise, Interster was far removed from any of the Anderson stories. There was no unified government as seen in either Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons or Fireball XL5 - South Africa alone possessed interstellar flight, and alone was in contact with the first aliens to visit earth, who supposedly hailed from Alpha Centauri, the star closest to Earth. In the stories, the protagonists were concerned only with the defense of South Africa - the rest of the world was more of an abstraction. Interaction with the Centauri's was the primary interaction with South Africa. A number of fascinating concepts were explored - relative to humans, the Centauris are only the size of dolls, and their ships and technology are scaled to match. Perhaps the greatest triumph of the puppeteers are not just the human puppets, but the Centauris - for they were as intricate, but barely 10 cm high as compared with the 32 cm human puppets for simultaneous shots. The plot contained some content of interest to South African adults who could see the political connotations to some of the themes like political isolation and attack from outsiders as well as some characters. One character (a villain) bore a remarkable resemblance to the then South African President PW Botha. Production The same team that produced Interster had started in the late 1970s with Liewe Heksie, with the same sophisticated puppetry making its first appearance in the adventures of a well-meaning but absent-minded little witch. The internal-wiring puppeteers made their final work a set of musical crickets that played music for a children's program featuring two more puppets, Sarel Seemonster, a friendly sea monster which could blow steam from his nostrils, and Karel Kraai, a crow which was fully functional to the point of being able to remove his hat, for the children's TV program Wielie Walie, named for the first line of a traditional Afrikaans children's verse version of 'Ring a Ring a Rosie'. Interster was the brain-child of filmmaker Lindsay du Plessis. Du Plessis also worked on the puppet series Tales of Africa before that. Interster was produced almost 10 years after the last Gerry Anderson television show to use supermarionation techniques (The Secret Service, 1969) and almost 15 years after Thunderbirds, and as a result was technically superior: * Puppets were internally wired, and movable in a large range of motion. * Computer programmed and controlled servos (using Apple II personal computer) provided better motion. * Models had a level of intricacy rivaling those from the Star Wars films. * Pyrotechnics were also more impressive, requiring a special permit from the production crew. * Many of them models 'Fly' using a sophisticated process involving ultra-thin lines and servo motor control, permitting a very convincing anti-gravity/flight special effect. With the film and TV camera process in use at the time of production, the thin lines are of course optically invisible on all shots of spacecraft. The cockpits of the Impalas are noteworthy for including a fairly sophisticated wiring loom, including flashing lights and a complete fully functional TV screen which is able to display computer text. In addition, the pilots sit in a semi-reclining position, echoing the seating of the F-16 jet fighter. The future Cape Town is a detailed model, and can be seen in considerable detail during the opening credits of the program in a downward looking flyby. The longer story arc and individual plots were also unusually sophisticated for a children's show.

Biography Martin Tranmæl grew up on a middle-sized farm in Melhus, in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. He started working as a painter and construction worker. In the early 20th century, Tranmæl lived for a while in the United States where he came into contact with the American workers movement, and even though he joined the AFL, he was also present at the founding congress of the Industrial Workers of the World, whose revolutionary syndicalist ideology he continued to be influenced by after returning to Norway. Upon his return, he eventually joined Norwegian Labour Party where he soon became one of the main leaders of the Party's left wing and worked for many different socialist papers. Tranmæl became a Communist after learning of the Russian Revolution of 1917, and he attended Comintern meetings in Russia and encouraged the Norwegian Labour Party to join the Communist International organization and accept the Twenty- one Conditions for membership. Eventually Tranmæl led the Norwegian Labour Party out of the Comintern after a conflict with its chairman Zinoviev in 1923. The Party was split in two and the Communist Party of Norway was formed that year by people who wanted to stay in the Comintern. He participated in the Left Communist Youth League's military strike action of 1924. He agitated for it through the newspaper Arbeiderbladet, and was convicted for this crime and sentenced to 5 months days of prison. During World War II and the Nazi occupation of Norway, Tranmæl lived in exile in Stockholm, Sweden. He had many friends there like Zeth Höglund and Ture Nerman. After the war he returned to Norway, and while still a socialist, had more moderate views and supported the Norwegian membership in NATO in 1949.

Media consultants usually draft press releases to highlight positive achievements of a business, organization, or individual. In politics, media consultants create advertisement campaigns to plant a desired image in the minds of voters. Top consulting firms such as Bain, McKinsey & Company, and Boston Consulting Group have media, technology, and entertainment practices. Media consultants at management consulting firms seek to address issues facing the industry such as strengthening operational efficiency, brand strategy, digital media strategies, and business technology. Media consultants are often employed by B2C businesses to help them manage their media agency relationships and audit their advertising spend. According to the World Federation of Advertisers Survey of the global advertisers, companies like ID Comms, Ebiquity, Accenture and 23 Media Audits are recognised as the major suppliers of media consulting. It is also used to describe a person or company that enables media organizations to develop their businesses. An example where a consultant would be needed is a company that is moving its print business online. Social Media Many consultants have entered the area of social media.

Founded by Carl Lindström (1869-1932), a Swedish inventor living in Berlin, it originally produced phonographs or gramophones with the brand names \\"Parlograph\\" and \\"Parlophon\\" and eventually began producing records as well. It became the holding company for Odeon Records, Parlophone Records (originally \\"Parlophon\\"), Beka Records, Okeh Records, Fonotipia Records, Lyrophon, Homophon, and other labels. Lindström sold the company to Max Straus (Odeon co-founder), but Lindström remained with the company as an engineer and inventor. World War I caused the company to cut back its holdings closing the United Kingdom branch of Odeon when war broke out. Okeh in the U.S. survived the war intact because its president, Otto Heinemann, was an American citizen. During the war, the Transoceanic Trading Company was set up in the Netherlands to look after its overseas assets. Lindström returned to the UK in 1923 with the establishment of a British Parlophone branch. Parlophone's \\"₤\\" trademark is not the Lira sign but a stylised blackletter \\"L\\" (\\\\mathfrak{L}) for Lindström. Among Parlophone's later claims to fame; it was the label for UK releases by The Beatles and Peter Sellers. The introduction of electrical recording with microphones and mixing consoles put Lindström at a disadvantage and they sold the company in 1926 to the Columbia Graphophone Company which had rights to electrical recording technology. In 1931, Columbia Graphophone merged with the Gramophone Company to form EMI with the labels retaining their identities. EMI's German unit in 1931 was originally called \\"Lindström-Electrola\\" after the merger. Okeh became part of the American operations of Columbia Records. Parlophone became a major powerhouse in the EMI portfolio of labels thanks to the company's signing in 1962 of The Beatles. As a condition of Universal Music Group acquiring EMI in 2012, European regulators forced EMI to spin off certain assets into a separate company called Parlophone Music Group. Parlophone was acquired by Warner Music Group in 2013.

Anti-climb paint on a gate in the UK Anti-climb paint (also known as non-drying paint, anti-intruder paint, anti-vandal grease) is a class of paint consisting of a thick oily coating that is applied with a stiff brush, trowel or by hand using a protective glove. In appearance it is similar to smooth gloss paint when applied but it remains slippery indefinitely thereby preventing any intruder from gaining a foothold.  Uses  It is used to prevent climbing on objects such as lamp posts, walls and fences. It owes its effectiveness to the fact that it is based on a non-drying oil and keeps the surface greasy and slippery. As an additional advantage, it leaves its mark on the person touching it and hence makes it possible for intruders to be identified. Anti-climb paint is often used to deter burglars seeking to enter a building by climbing up to a higher entry point, such as a window on an upper floor.  Characteristics  Anti-climb paint continues to work in hot or cold weather conditions, adhering to the surfaces to which it is applied. It can be used on most building materials. It is particularly effective in preventing climbing on walls, parapets, boundary fences, down pipes, lamp standards and roofs. The outer surface may appear to be dry on the surface, but attempting to climb over it will reveal the soft paint underneath. It has an effective lifetime of around three years, after which a fresh coat is usually recommended. It cannot be washed off and is resistant to removal by a variety of chemicals.  Safety  To keep the general public from being affected by the paint, it is usually applied above a certain height on the object being painted. Typically it is applied from a height of 8 ft / 2.4 metres above the ground. The paint is most effective when an intruder has to climb several feet before being stopped by a band of anti-climb paint.  History  It was developed by Camrex Paints in the early 1960s.

The school, an all-boys residential and non-residential institution, spreading over of land, was founded in 1853 by the Capuchin Fathers and entrusted to the Society of the Brothers of St. Patrick (Ireland) in 1894. It was opened in a cottage known as Manor House; the name by which the campus is still known. The students are known as Manorites. The school has an alumni network spread across the globe. In 2005, the Indian Air Force gifted the school a trainer jet aircraft, TS-11 Iskra, as a tribute to the distinguished service of the school's alumni in the armed forces.Warbirds of India - Dehradun History The school was founded in 1853 by the Capuchin Fathers who gave it to the Society of the Reverend Brothers of St. Patrick (Ireland) in 1894 with Bro. Stapleton as its first principal. While St. George's College was founded in 1853, another school, St. Fidelis High School, was started in the same location in 1863. Initially, the Capuchin Fathers ran both schools with Father James Doogan as principal of both from 1873 till they were given to the Patrician Brothers in 1894. In 1948, St. Fidelis High School was amalgamated with St. George's College. There still are old directional markings on the school campus pointing towards the old St. Fidelis. In the early 1900s, the then Principal, Bro. Haverty, levelled the top of the hill to create what is the Top Flat, the school's largest playing field. The Science labs were constructed in 1925 adjacent to the top flat. The school acquired the Whytebank Castle and Brooklands Estate in 1939, and an auditorium was constructed in 1942.Manorite The school is named after Saint George, the patron saint of England and a number of countries and cities around the world. The legend of Saint George slaying the dragon is known throughout the world, and forms the theme of the school's emblem. A clock tower was erected on the field in 1936, and was the first clock tower in Mussoorie. It was installed by JB Joyce & Company, who imported the clock from England. The chimes, ringing every 15 minutes, would also help keep away the wild animals from the surrounding woods. Under the guidance of then principal, Bro. J.C. Carroll, the school witnessed a construction boom in the 1990s. This included a new indoor gymnasium, a library, a multi-functional auditorium, and an indoor heated swimming pool. There were upgrades to old dormitories and class rooms. The alumni network of the school contributed substantial funds and donated material towards the construction. The St. George's College museum displays the 150-year history of the school. The museum also serves as an archive for preserving hundreds of old photographs, instruments, school records, yearbooks and furniture. The collection includes photographs from the 1870s, scientific instruments from the 1900s, and an old piano.Welcome To The Official Website Of St. George's College, Mussoorie, India- Archives School site St. George's College is spread over a estate in Barlowganj village, a hamlet situated 5 km from the hill town of Mussoorie, popularly referred to as the 'Queen of Hills'.

Normally, the breakdown of the amino acid tyrosine involves the conversion of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate to homogentisate by 4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase. Complete deficiency of this enzyme would lead to tyrosinemia III. In rare cases, however, the enzyme is still able to produce the reactive intermediate 1,2-epoxyphenyl acetic acid, but is unable to convert this intermediate to homogentisate. The intermediate then spontaneously reacts with glutathione to form 2-L-cystein-S-yl-1,4-dihydroxy- cyclohex-5-en-1-yl acetic acid (hawkinsin). Patients present with metabolic acidosis during the first year of life, and growth arrest around the time of weaning off breast milk. Treatment involves a diet containing a low amount of phenylalanine and tyrosine. Tolerance toward these amino acids normalizes as the patients get older. Then only a chlorine-like smell of the urine indicates the presence of the condition. Patients have a normal life and do not require treatment or a special diet. The production of hawkinsin is the result of a gain-of-function mutation. Inheritance of hawkinsinuria is therefore autosomal dominant (presence of a single mutated copy of the gene causes the condition). The gene affected is the HPD gene encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid dioxygenase, on chromosome 12q24. It is unusual in that most other inborn errors of metabolism are caused by loss-of-function mutations, and hence have recessive inheritance (condition occurs only if both copies are mutated).

Retrieved August 15, 2015. History In the 1930s Carl Jeppson, a Scanian immigrant to Chicago, began marketing his home-made brew. He sold it from door to door for medicinal and other purposes, and one legend says he preferred the strong taste because years' smoking had dulled his taste-buds. Attorney George Brode purchased the original recipe from Carl Jeppson and created the famous Jeppson's Malört testimonial that once appeared on every bottle. Patricia Gabelick was hired by Brode as his secretary in 1966, and took over the business after Brode's death in 1999, running it out of her Lakeview apartment. It was made in Chicago until the mid-1970s, when the Mar- Salle distillery that produced it for the Carl Jeppson Company closed. It was then made in Kentucky briefly, after which it was produced in Florida for many years.Brown, Mark (May 6, 2007). \\"What Drink Asks 'Are You Man Enough?'\\", Chicago Sun-Times.

Although the city's flag has had four red stars since 1939, the label bears the three red stars of the 1933 flag. Reputation rests on bitter taste While Gabelick acknowledged that the drink is a \\"niche liquor,\\" selling a comparatively small number of cases annually, it has gained increased relevance among bartenders, bikers, and Chicago's Hispanic community, where Gabelick notes that it has become \\"a rite of passage.\\" The satirist John Hodgman has also adopted the drink in his stage show, offering shots to his audience.Watson, Bruce (September 11, 2010). \\"Turning Foul Flavors Into Sweet Success\\", Daily Finance.

West Town's Hoosier Mama Pie Co. used Jeppson's in 2017 for \\"a meringue-style pie\\", called the “Chicago Sunrise”. In Joe Swanberg's 2013 film Drinking Buddies, drinking a shot of Malört is described as a Chicago tradition for erasing past mistakes. In it actor Jason Sudeikis riffs that Malört is like swallowing a burnt condom filled with gasoline. In a similar vein, Tremaine Atkinson, founder of CH Distillery, was introduced to Malört when he first moved to Chicago, he compared it to \\"taking a bite out of a grapefruit and then drinking a shot of gasoline\\".

Ojibway was the last of the great proglacial lakes of the last ice age. Comparable in size to Lake Agassiz (to which it was likely linked), and north of the Great Lakes, it was at its greatest extent c. 8,500 years BP. The former lakebed forms the modern Clay Belt, an area of fertile land. Lake Ojibway was relatively short-lived. The lake drained in what must have been a catastrophic and dramatic manner around 8,200 years BP. One hypothesis is that a weakening ice dam separating it from Hudson Bay broke, as the lake was roughly above sea level. A comparable mechanism produced the Missoula floods that created the channeled scablands of the Columbia River basin. A recent analysis states it has not been conclusively determined whether the lake drained by a breach of the ice dam, by water spilling over the glacier, or by a flood under the glacier. It is also not conclusively known whether there were one or more pulses, and the route the water took to reach Hudson's Bay has not been determined. The draining of Lake Ojibway is a possible cause of the 8.2 kiloyear event, a major global cooling that occurred 8,200 years BP.

Kaiser Family Foundation, is an American non-profit organization, headquartered in San Francisco, California. It prefers KFF since its legal name can cause confusion as it is no longer a foundation or a family foundation, and is not associated with Kaiser Permanente. KFF focuses on major health care issues facing the nation, as well as U.S. role in global health policy. KFF states that it is a non-partisan source of facts and analysis, polling and journalism for policymakers, the media, the health care community, and the general public, and its website has been heralded for having the \\"most up-to-date and accurate information on health policy\\" and as a \\"must-read for healthcare devotees.\\" Current activities=Policy analysis and polling KFF publishes analysis, polling and journalism about health-care issues, and states that much of its work especially concerns persons with low income or those who are otherwise especially vulnerable to health-care cost, such as the uninsured, those with chronic illnesses, or Medicaid/Medicare recipients. In addition to domestic U.S. health policy issues, KFF also conducts work on the U.S. role in global health policy. In early 2020 its analysis and polling focused heavily on the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2010, KFF began providing resources for consumers seeking information about the then new health insurance law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act with a series of animated videos explaining the health law and health insurance terms as well as a calculator for people to estimate what health insurance coverage would cost them. Kaiser is well known for public opinion research, documenting the views and experiences of the public on health and related issuesoften in partnership with major news organizations, such as The Washington Post and The New York Times. Health news and information Through KHN (Kaiser Health News), KFF's editorially independent news service dedicated to coverage of health care policy and politics, KFF provides coverage of health policy issues and developments at the federal and state levels in the health care marketplace and health care delivery system. KHN reporters were finalists for a 2020 Pulitzer Prize in Investigative Reporting for exposing predatory bill collection by the University of Virginia Health System that relentlessly squeezed low-income patients—many into bankruptcy—forcing the non-profit, state-run hospital to change its tactics. KFF also sponsors training and site visits for health care reporters. KFF works with major media and corporate partners, government agencies and health departments, national leadership and community organizations, and other foundations to undertake large-scale public information campaigns on pressing health and social issues, mostly on HIV/AIDS, including (current and former campaigns): It's Your (Sex) Life (MTV); GYT: Get Yourself Tested (MTV, CDC, Planned Parenthood); Rap it Up (BET); KNOW HIV/AIDS (Viacom and CBS Corporation); Enterate Protegate and Soy… (Univision); and PAUSE (Fox Broadcasting Network). KFF worked with UNAIDS in 2004 to launch the Global Media AIDS Initiative at the United Nations to mobilize media in response to the global AIDS pandemic. Large-scale regional media coalitions operated under auspices of the GMAI, including efforts in Africa, the Caribbean, the Asia-Pacific region, Eastern Europe and now developing Central and South America. Under Greater Than AIDSa national public information response to the U.S. epidemic launched in 2009KFF works with a broad cross section of public and private partners to increase knowledge, reduce stigma and promote actions to stem the spread of HIV. While national in scope, Greater Than AIDS focuses on communities most affected. History KFF was established in 1948 by Henry J. Kaiser. The Kaiser Family Foundation was originally set up in Oakland, California, the same city in which Kaiser Permanente's headquarters were located. Later, the KFF moved to Menlo Park, about 50 miles away from Oakland. In 2018, it relocated to San Francisco, CA. When Mr. Kaiser died in 1967, his second wife, Ale Chester, inherited half of his estate, and the other half went to the KFF. Ale sold all of her holdings, moved far away, and remarried. Mr. Kaiser's children received very little direct inheritance; but did receive authority to run the Kaiser Industries businesses, and the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 1977, ten years after Kaiser's death, the conglomerate of disparate Kaiser Industries organizations split apart. The Kaiser Family Foundation was initially a major owner of these shares: at the time of dissolution, the Foundation owned 32 percent according to Fortune Magazine. By 1985, the foundation no longer had an ownership stake in the Kaiser companies and is no longer associated with Kaiser Permanente or Kaiser Industries. KFF is now an independent national organization and one family member, selected by the Board, serves on the Board of Directors of KFF. The Kaiser Family Foundation previously funded professorial chairs at UC Berkeley, Stanford University, Harvard University, and Johns Hopkins University, named the Henry J. Kaiser Professorships. Starting in September 1990, KFF CEO Drew Altman directed \\"a complete overhaul of the Foundation's mission and operating style.\\" Altman changed a \\"sleepy grant-making organization\\" (some $30 million a year interest on the $400 million endowment), into a leading voice and repository for facts and information on health-care issues.

Following the mask's replacement by the General Service Respirator in 2011, the S10 is now widely available to the public on the army surplus market. History A British soldier with the S10 respirator during Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) warfare exercises The S10 was introduced in 1986 as a replacement for the S6 NBC Respirator in service from the 1960s, and is manufactured by Avon Rubber. S10s were issued to British nationals in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War and were marked by a blue coloured PSM (Primary Speech Module) fitting or a blue painted spot on the forehead. The S10 respirator was originally due to be replaced by the new General Service Respirator (GSR) in 2007, although replacement efforts officially began in 2011 and all S10 Respirators have since been replaced with the GSR. All issued filters for the S10 have expired, the last of which expired in 2014. No new S10 Respirators will be bought. Characteristics The mask includes a fail-safe drinking device, a Secondary Speech Transmitter (SST) on the side which a Clansman radio system microphone can be clipped to, and corrective lenses can be fitted to the eyepieces. The mask also contains an inner oro-nasal mask to decrease fogging on the lenses. This mask is fitted with optical insert hooks, and therefore can be used by soldiers who wear glasses. Variants Variants include: *SF10, intended for security and special forces use (replaced, at least in SAS service, by the CT12) *AR10 for police forces *N10, a commercial version. The standard mask was also available with the canister on the right hand side so that left- handed troops could fire their weapon.

Biography=Early career Satō was born in Yamagata prefecture and attended military preparatory school in Sendai. He graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1913 and the Army Staff College in 1921, and was assigned to administrative duties within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. He spent two years as the head of the War History Bureau, during which time he came into contact with many important members of the Tōseiha political faction within the Army, including Kuniaki Koiso and Hideki Tōjō, and was involved in the creation of the Sakurakai organization with Kingoro Hashimoto. Also during this period, he had serious conflicts with the head of the General Affairs section of the General Staff Renya Mutaguchi, who also happened to be a staunch supporter of the rival Kōdōha faction. he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in December 1932 and assigned to the IJA 11th Infantry Regiment. From August 1934, he was assigned to the staff of the IJA 6th Division. During the February 26 incident, IJA 6th Division played a role in the suppression of the pro-Kōdōha attempted coup-d'etat. Soviet-Japanese border conflict Satō was promoted to colonel in October 1937 and assigned command of the Manchukuo- based IJA 75th Infantry Regiment. His regiment was at the Battle of Lake Khasan, refusing to budge from its positions even after sustaining over 50% casualties, and then ousted the Soviet forces from a disputed hill in a night assault which the Japanese considered to be a model of its tactical type. Satō later boasted that since he was not in favor with Tōjō, his unit had been given the worst position on the front lines, and he looked forward to being given the worst position again at the next battle. From December 1938 he was commander of the 2nd Sector, 8th Border Garrison, which was at the Nomonhan Incident. In August 1939 he was promoted to major general and was assigned to command the IJA 23rd Infantry Brigade, in Hailar, Manchukuo. The Burma campaign In March 1941, Satō was attached to the staff of the IJA 54th Division and in October 1941 became commander of the IJA 67th Independent Brigade. He was promoted to lieutenant general in December 1942. From March 1943, he was assigned command of the IJA 31st Division from the time of its activation in China. Assigned to construction operations in Thailand, the division was ordered to Burma to join the Fifteenth Army in September, 1943. The Japanese plan to invade India, codenamed U-Go, was originally intended as a spoiling attack against the IV Corps at Imphal, to disrupt the Allied offensive plans for that year. The commander of the Fifteenth Army was none other than his old nemesis Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi. Despite the objections of his staff, Mutaguchi enlarged the plan to include an invasion of India itself and perhaps even overthrow the British Raj.Allen, pp. 154–155 Despite reports to Tokyo from his subordinates on the infeasibility of the plan, the objections were eventually overruled by Army Minister Hideki Tōjō. Part of the plan involved sending the 31st Division (which was composed of 58th, 124th, and 138th Regiments, and the 31st Mountain Artillery Regiment) to capture Kohima and thus cut off Imphal, and then destroy the rail yard at Dimapur. Divisional commander Satō was unhappy with his role. He had not been involved in the planning of the offensive and seriously doubted the Japanese chances for success; he had already told his staff that they might all starve to death, as Mutaguchi made no provision for logistics or resupply.Allen, p.232 In common with many senior Japanese officers, Satō considered Mutaguchi to be a \\"blockhead\\", although General William Slim considered Satō himself to be Allen, pp.284–285 By the middle of May, Sato's troops were starving as had been predicted. He considered that Mutaguchi and the HQ of Japanese Fifteenth Army were taking little notice of his situation, as they had issued several confusing and contradictory orders to him during April.Allen, p.287 Because the main attack on Imphal faltered around the middle of April, Mutaguchi ordered 31st Division or parts of it to join in the attack on Imphal from the north, even while the division was struggling to capture and hold Kohima. Satō considered that his division was being \\"messed around\\" without proper planning or consideration for the conditions. Nor did Satō believe that Fifteenth Army headquarters were exerting themselves to move supplies to his division.Allen, pp.287–293 He began pulling his troops back to conserve their strength, thus allowing the British to secure Kohima Ridge. On 25 May, Satō notified Fifteenth Army HQ that he would withdraw on 1 June unless his division received supplies.Allen, p.288 Finally on 31 May, he abandoned positions north of the road, in spite of orders from Mutaguchi to hold his positions.Allen, p.289 (For a divisional commander to retreat without orders or permission from his superior was unheard-of in the Japanese Army.)Allen, p.292 (fn), p.308 After ignoring army orders for several weeks, Satō was removed from command of 31st Division on 7 July 1944. Satō refused an invitation by Mutaguchi to commit seppuku and demanded a court martial to clear his name and publicly expose Mutaguchi's incompetence. At the prompting of Lieutenant General Masakazu Kawabe, commander of Burma Area Army, doctors declared that he had suffered a mental breakdown and was unfit to stand trial on 23 November 1944.Allen, p.309 He was ordered to retire, but was recalled to active duty immediately and assigned to the staff of the Sixteenth Army, which was a garrison force in Java. In May 1945, he was attached to the staff of the Sendai-based Northeastern Area Army, which was assigned to defend the Tohoku region of Japan against possible Allied invasion. Postwar After the surrender of Japan, Satō was often vilified in the press as a coward and was accused of causing the Japanese defeat in Burma. For his part, Satō continued to insist until his death in 1959 that the actions he took were necessary to save the lives of his men, and that the charges of insanity made against him for withdrawing from the battle were unjustified. Satō devoted his efforts to assisting surviving members of his former command, and he created a group of ex-army men who erected a monuments to the fallen of the Imphal Campaign in Matsuyama, Ehime and in Shonai, Yamagata.

The station is on the Henley-on- Thames branch line that links the towns of Henley-on-Thames and Twyford. It is down the line from Twyford and measured from . It is served by local services operated by Great Western Railway. The station has a single platform, which is used by trains in both directions. There is a 50-space car park, but no station building other than a simple shelter. The station is unmanned, and tickets must be purchased on the train. The station was built in the village of Lashbrook in 1857, but named for the main village of Shiplake. The village of Shiplake, with the parish Church and grand manor houses of Shiplake Court and Shiplake House is actually over a mile away to the south of Shiplake Station. Victorian developers and their commuting commercial customers however then chose to build new houses close to the station, and the hamlet of Lashbrook grew rapidly and eventually changed its name to Lower Shiplake in the early twentieth century. In June 1914, it is said suffragettes were intending to burn Shiplake Church, but on realising it was such a distance from the station of the same name, burned Wargrave Church down instead. A camping coach was positioned here by the Western Region from 1956 to 1963. Service In normal service, there is a regular service between Henley-on- Thames station and Twyford station, with all trains calling at Shiplake station. Passengers for Paddington and Reading must change at Twyford. Trains operate twice an hour during the day, with less frequent services in the early morning and late evenings. Trains run to the same basic frequency seven days a week, but start and finish times for the service differ by day of the week. During the Henley Royal Regatta, held every July, a special timetable is operated with additional trains. During the period of the regatta, not all trains stop at Shiplake station. The platform can hold 7 coaches. Level crossing There is a level crossing north of the station that, despite being well signalled, has been the site of a numerous accidents and near misses over the years. The crossing had no barriers until March 2013, when Network Rail had automatic half-barriers installed. In October 2014, safety cameras described by locals as 'looking like robots' were controversially installed to monitor the crossing.http://www.henleystandard.co.uk/news/news.php?id=1540246 ReferencesExternal links * Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Oxfordshire Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1857 Category:Railway stations served by Great Western Railway Category:1857 establishments in England ","title":"Shiplake railway station"},{"id":"4423474","text":"Firth is a Scottish word for a coastal water body.

Built 1902–04 for patron Susan Lawrence Dana, it is located along East Lawrence Avenue in Springfield, Illinois. The home reflects the mutual affection of the patron and the architect for organic architecture, the relatively flat landscape of the U.S. state of Illinois, and the Japanese aesthetic as expressed in Japanese prints. Susan Lawrence Dana Susan Lawrence Dana (1862–1946) was an independent- minded woman and heiress to a substantial fortune, including silver mines in the Rocky Mountains. Widowed in 1900, Dana enjoyed complete control over her household and fortune. Eager to express her personality and become a leading philanthropic figure in Springfield, Dana decided to completely remodel her family's Italianate mansion located in the state capital's fashionable \\"Aristocracy Hill\\" neighborhood. Dana House Dana's search for an architect to match her aspirations ended when she was introduced in 1902 to Frank Lloyd Wright, the rising leader of the new Prairie School movement of \\"organic architecture\\" which stressed congruence between the interior of a building and its surroundings. The Dana commission to plan the remodeling of the Lawrences' Italianate mansion was the largest Wright had received. Recognizing a kindred spirit in Mrs. Dana, he expanded the boundaries of his contract to design and build what was, in effect, an entirely new house showcasing his approach to the Prairie Style aesthetic. The new home reflected the flamboyant personalities of the patron and the architect, particularly their love of Japanese prints and drawings. The structure was designed for both display and entertainment. An arched doorway admitted guests into a series of expanding spaces, transitioning from vestibule to the reception hall. Window detail The concept of \\"expanding space\\" was repeated throughout the house, with windows placed to continually draw the attention of someone within toward an awareness of the outside. Wright designed approximately 450 art glass windows, skylights, door panels, sconces, and light fixtures for the house, most of which survive. Much of the art glass, and the mural by George Niedecken surmounting the dining room interior, centered on a sumac motif. A substantial west wing leads visitors through an interior Torii gate into two of the largest rooms in the house. The upper-level gallery was used for musical entertaining, and the ground-level library contains special easels, part of more than 100 pieces of free-standing Wright-designed white oak furniture in the house, created for Dana to display selections from her collection of Japanese prints,. Dana lived in the home from 1904 until about 1928. Once a successful hostess and leader of Springfield's social scene, she became increasingly reclusive over time and turned her attention to spiritualism and the occult. Suffering from increasing financial constraints in her later years, she closed the main house around 1928 and moved to a small cottage on the grounds. As Dana struggled with age-related dementia in the 1940s, her home and its contents were sold. Dana-Thomas House South and East exterior elevations Charles C. Thomas, a successful medical publisher, was the second owner and custodian of the home from 1944 to his death in 1969. A view of the building was featured on the title pages of some of his publications. His wife Nanette maintained in that role until her passing in 1975. The couple are credited with maintaining the house's original furnishings and design, and their estate with selling the home and its furnishings as a unit to the state of Illinois in 1981 for $1.0 million, significantly less than could have been earned had the household been broken up. The home today The home became a state historic site under the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA). The IHPA led a restoration effort in 1987–1990 that restored the structure and its contents to its appearance in 1910. It is believed to contain one of the most intact Frank Lloyd Wright designed interiors in the United States. Restoration plans and documents are held by the Ryerson & Burnham Libraries at the Art Institute of Chicago. The house was featured in Bob Vila's A&E; Network 1996 production, Guide to Historic Homes of America. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Dana Thomas House was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). As part of a program of budget cuts, the state of Illinois temporarily closed the Dana–Thomas House to the public from December 1, 2008 until April 23, 2009. The Dana–Thomas House again closed for 11 months in 2011 for renovations to interior and exterior finish as well as mechanical and security systems.

Ostankino Tower visible above rooftops (right). Vodootvodny Canal () is a 4 kilometre long, 30-60 metre wide canal in downtown Moscow, Russia. It was built in the 1780s on the old riverbed of the Moskva River to control floods and support shipping. Canal construction created an island between the Moskva River and the canal. The island acquired its present shape in 1938 with the completion of Moscow Canal megaproject. The canal is spanned by ten bridges; the eleventh is now under construction. Moscow floods 1739 map. River level shown at a summer low: old river bed dried out, leaving isolated patches of mud. Zamoskvorechye, the land on the flat southern bank of Moskva river, was frequently flooded in spring. The river itself used to migrate south from its present site and back, discouraging construction. Low lands on both sides of the river were only suitable for farming. In dry periods, the old river bed used to shrink into isolated muddy swamps, spreading disease. Residents had to combat inundation levels by digging small moats and dikes, with little result. The memory of these moats (ровушки, ендовы; rovyshki, yendovy) remains in the names of Raushskaya embankment and Church of St. George v Yendove (literally, in the pot). The most notable, permanent moat was that separating St. George from Balchug Street. Kazakov project, 1775 1775 Canal project by Matvey Kazakov The first documented flood control project was drawn up in 1775, presumably by Matvey Kazakov (senior). In addition to creating an island separated from Zamoskvorechye, Kazakov also proposed cutting two flood control dikes west from Bersenevka. This would separate strips of floodland from the mainland, creating two more islands. In the east, Kazakov planned to flood uninhabited farmland permanently, and connect the Canal to the Moskva River inside the present-day Garden Ring. The eastern end of an island would become Moscow's fortified grain port and warehouse. The moat east of Balchug had to be cleared and widened, too. 1783–1786 canal A notably devastating flood occurred in 1783, razing the suburbs and damaging Bolshoy Kamenny Bridge (three spans collapsed, killing four people). In order to repair it, the Moskva River was temporarily drained, and its water diverted into the old river bed. Prior to closing the main waterway, the old river bed was cleared and widened. Kazakov's plan materialized in 1783-1786, excluding the grain terminal. An 1807 plan shows only one \\"additional\\" island west of Bersenevka; otherwise, it follows Kazakov's project; the main island is cut into two halves by the Balchug moat. 19th century After the Fire of 1812, the western island and the dike separating it from the mainland were reclaimed for development (today, they form the Golden Mile of Khamovniki District). The Moskva River was reduced to about its present-day width (see the 1824 map). The eastern end of the Canal was also reduced to its ordinary width of 30 metres. ZAM 1807 German map blue.jpg1807 map (actual) ZAM 1824 Rebuild Plan Blue.jpg1824 map (project) ZAM 1853 Khotev Atlas blue.jpg1853 map (actual) In 1835, the city built Babyegorodskaya Dam west of the island. The dam was disassembled each autumn and set back in place after the spring flood, so it was good for shipping but useless against floods. A new channel extension east was built to bypass the old 90-degree turn; as the 1853 map shows, the new canal cut Red Hills neighborhood away from the mainland. For a while, the island was cut into three parts, then, when Balchug moat was filled, in two. 1930s – present day Golutvin Sloboda offices, converted 19th century factories across the Canal The completion of the Moscow Canal (1932–1938) raised the water level in the Moskva River and the canal, enabling reliable shipping throughout summer seasons. Locks on the canal were demolished (this function was taken by Pererva locks downstream). The moat parallel to Garden Ring was also filled in the 1930s, with the completion of Bolshoy Krasnokholmsky Bridge. The first bridges of the Soviet age, Komissariatsky bridge (1927) and the pedestrian Zverev Bridge (1927) were built with sufficient clearance. Chugunny Bridge (1889) was also compatible with new requirements (completion of a new Bolshoy Moskvoretsky Bridge diverted traffic away from this bridge). All other bridges were rebuilt in the 1930s to 6-8 traffic lanes. In the 1960s, Schluzovoy Bridge construction connected the embankments on the eastern tip of the island. Chugunny Bridge steel deck was replaced with concrete. Sadovnichesky Bridge was completed in 1963; it is actually a water pipe conduit with a secondary function of a pedestrian bridge. Two more pedestrian bridges, Second Schluzovoy and Luzhkov Bridge, were added in the 1990s. Construction of the Patriarshy Bridge extension over the canal is currently under way. The city planners entertain plans to build a parking lot under the canal, from across Golutvin sloboda office block (see photo above), to Tretyakov Gallery. This would require setting up dams, temporarily drying up the canal and digging the open pit.

During his time in professional football Southall was a midfielder from 1991 to 2014 who competed in the top four tiers of English league football, notably in the Premier League for Bolton Wanderers. He has represented Hartlepool United, Grimsby Town, Gillingham, Norwich City and Nottingham Forest in the Football League as well as Dover Athletic and Whitstable Town in Non-league. Childhood and early career A former pupil of Coulby Newham Secondary School, he has used his second given name since childhood. He started his career as a left-winger, but has played in most positions, including goalkeeper. Southall was spotted playing Sunday football for Nunthorpe Boys and was offered a trial at Newcastle United. After realising he'd have little chance of breaking into the Newcastle team he left and joined Darlington on schoolboy terms. Playing career=Hartlepool United Darlington let him go but he resumed his career with Hartlepool United where he was a regular in the first team for four seasons. Every one of his 130 appearances for Hartlepool was as a member of the starting line-up, and he scored 28 goals. Grimsby Town He was transferred to Grimsby Town for £40,000 and played 55 times, scoring nine goals. On his home debut he had to play in goal after the Grimsby keeper was sent off – allegedly, the other players forced him in because he had the same surname as legendary Everton keeper Neville Southall. Grimsby manager Brian Laws signed the Italian Ivano Bonetti as Southall's replacement just months after Southall himself had arrived at Blundell Park, forcing Southall out of the first-team altogether for much of the mid-season. He often failed to even make the bench and at one point was even asked to do co-commentary for the local media stations. Southall became a target of the boo-boys at Grimsby after his own-goal against Stoke condemned Grimsby to relegation. After Bonetti had a disagreement with Laws, Southall was given a chance to re-establish himself in the first-team. After scoring an own-goal against Stoke City during Grimsby's relegation run- in the 96/97 season, Southall was frozen out of the first team in the 1997–98 season. Gillingham He then moved on a free transfer to Gillingham, where he became a popular figure. He made almost 200 appearances for the Gills and scored 29 goals, including a goal nominated for Goal of the Month against then Premiership side Sheffield Wednesday to knock them out of the FA Cup. Bolton Wanderers After this spell at Gillingham he moved to the Premiership with Bolton Wanderers. He thereby became one of the few footballers to play in all four divisions of the Football League system. He made just over 20 appearances for them and scored once, against Newcastle United. He went on loan to Norwich City for a brief spell as he looked to secure a permanent move away from the Premiership. Gillingham (second spell) He caused a stir at Gillingham by making a welcome return there on a free transfer. He made a further 90 appearances but failed to recapture the form which had previously made him a cult hero there. Southall slumps to the ground after Gillingham are relegated by Nottingham Forest Gillingham were relegated to League One at the end of the 2004–05 season after being held to a draw by Nottingham Forest. He was out-of-contract and Gillingham did not retain his services. Nottingham Forest Nottingham Forest offered the 33-year-old a two-year contract shortly after. In the 2005–06 season, he came second in the club Player of the Season vote, behind Ian Breckin, with 18% of the votes. He finished the season with eight goals as Forest narrowly missed out on a play-off place. Gillingham (third spell) At the end of the 2006–07 season he was due to be out of contract. Forest fans were keen to see his contract renewed, however, on 31 January 2007 it was announced that he had rejoined Gillingham for a third spell on a two-and-a-half-year deal. Southall made his third debut for Gillingham in the 3–1 away defeat to Huddersfield Town on 3 February. Gillingham F.C. official website He joined Dover Athletic on a one-month loan deal on 9 September 2008. Southall made an immediate impact on his Dover debut, setting up Shaun Welford for the opening goal of the game against Hendon.Hendon 0–2 Dover Athletic match report from hendonfc.net He regained a place in the Gillingham team later that season, and made his final appearance as a substitute in the playoff semi-final second leg against Rochdale on 10 May 2009. Dover Athletic Southall rejoined Dover Athletic during the 2009 pre-season on trial, playing in a handful of friendlies before signing on a permanent deal. NICKY SIGNS FOR WHITES In August 2009, Southall scored his first goal for Dover with a well struck free kick to give his side the lead in an encounter against Dorchester Town. He became player/assistant manager when Ian Hendon was appointed manager of the club in May 2010; however, within a month Hendon had been appointed as assistant manager at Gillingham by his predecessor at Dover, Andy Hessenthaler. Gillingham (fourth spell) Southall signed for the Gills for a fourth time, as player/coach.Gillingham offer too good to miss – Nicky Southall His fourth Gillingham debut came in a defeat to his previous club, Dover, in a first round FA Cup match on 6 December 2010. When he departed Gillingham in May 2012, his appearance in the FA Cup represented his only appearance in his two years with the Gills. Whitstable Town On 26 June 2012 Southall joined Whitstable Town as a player/coach. He then took over as player manager,http://www.kentnews.co.uk/sport/gills_favourite_nicky_southall_signs_for_whitstable_town_1_1421948 but left at the end of the 2013–14 season, moving to Maidstone United as assistant manager.

Early life and education Born in Kamloops General Hospital, in Kamloops, British Columbia, Davis grew up in Tranquille Valley on a homestead where he attended school in a one-room log cabin. The Davis family moved into Kamloops so that Davis could attend Grade 8 at Kamloops High School; he was elected student council president, as was his sister Ethel Davis Moore. Jack won provincial scholarships in junior and senior matriculation, the latter with the highest marks in B.C. Jack attended the University of British Columbia, where he was president of the Engineers and the Men's Undergraduate Society, and a member of U.B.C. Thunderbird Basketball team, which won the Canadian Men's Senior Championship. He graduated with a Bachelor of Applied Science (chemical engineering) and was chosen a Rhodes Scholar from British Columbia in 1939. His attendance at St John's College, Oxford University, was interrupted by the Second World War. Davis was the only engineer on a Canadian research team at a McGill University developing a new process for manufacturing RDX. Writing up the RDX process gave Jack his PhD in Science in 1942. Political career In 1962, Davis was elected to the Canadian House of Commons representing the riding of Coast—Capilano, a riding which stretched from Deep Cove in the District of North Vancouver to Powell River and Pemberton. A member of the then-minority Liberal Party of Canada, he was re-elected in the following year in the train of the national Liberal victory and was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary to Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson. Davis was re- elected in the Canadian federal elections of 1965 and 1968 (now in the riding of Capilano (electoral district) and 1972. A cabinet minister in the government of Pierre Elliott Trudeau, he was Minister without Portfolio, Minister of Fisheries, Minister of Fisheries and Forestry, and the first Minister of the Environment in the English-speaking world. He was defeated in the Canadian federal election of 1974. In the British Columbia provincial election of 1975, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia as a member of the British Columbia Social Credit Party representing the district of North Vancouver-Seymour. He was sworn in as the Minister of Transport and Communication in the new Bill Bennett government. He resigned in 1978 at the demand of the Premier, Bill Bennett. He was fined $1,000 on September 18, 1978 after being convicted of fraud over his practice of converting Government-paid first class airline tickets to economy class and keeping the change.Globe and Mail September 19, 1978 found on http://blogborgcollective.blogspot.ca/2014/03/a-bc-mla-perception-of- entitlements.html He was re-elected in the 1979 British Columbia general election, 1983 British Columbia general election, 1986 British Columbia general election. Davis was also a cabinet minister in the government of Bill Vander Zalm and was Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources when he died in office of cancer in 1991. An energy audit prepared for Alternative Energy Policy Branch of the Ministry of Energy and Mines in 2005 found that the Jack Davis Building at 1810 Blanshard Street in Victoria was currently operating at a high level of energy efficiency. The initial design of the building, which won the building acclaim upon completion in 1992, is still reaping the benefits of energy efficient construction via low energy expenditures. Legacy There are two scholarships to UBC awarded in memory of Davis. The Jack Davis Scholarship in Energy Studies is a $2,700 scholarship that has been endowed by Westcoast Energy Inc. in memory of the Honourable Jack Davis. The award is made to a graduate student in energy studies at the University of British Columbia. The second Jack Davis scholarship is awarded annually to an outstanding all-round North Shore secondary school graduate to assist in his or her entering the University of British Columbia.http://www.jackdavisscholarship.ca Victoria Office building named after Jack Davis is located at 1810 Blanshard Street Victoria, BC, Canada.

The municipality existed from 1858 until 1964 when it became part of the new municipality of Høyanger. Prior to its dissolution, the municipality of Kyrkjebø included land on the north and south side of the Sognefjorden. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Kyrkjebø, where the main Kyrkjebø Church is located. Name The municipality was originally named after the old Klævold farm (). The first element comes from the Old Norse word kleppr meaning \\"hill\\" and the second element is identical to the Old Norse word vǫllr meaning \\"level ground\\". Therefore, the meaning could be a hill in the middle of level ground. The municipality was later named after the old Kirkebø farm, since Kyrkjebø Church was located there. The first element of the name is identical with the name for \\"church\\", and the second element of the name is identical with the word for \\"farm\\". It was named this because it was the farm where the church was located. From 1890 until 1917 the name was spelled Kirkebø (using the Bokmål spelling) and then in 1917 it was changed to Kyrkjebø (using the Nynorsk spelling). History The parish of Klævold was established as a municipality in 1858 when it was separated from the municipality of Lavik. At the time of its creation, it had a population of 1,645. On 1 January 1875, a border adjustment took place, moving part of Klævold with 90 inhabitants to the neighboring municipality of Lavik og Brekke. On 1 July 1890, the name was changed from Klævold to Kirkebø, and then in 1917 it was changed again to Kyrkjebø. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the municipality of Kyrkjebø (population: 4,742) was merged with the neighboring municipality of Lavik (population: 894) and the unpopulated Nybø and Nygjerdet part of Vik Municipality to become a part of the newly created municipality of Høyanger.

Velecký was a very particular figure of Slovak acting, being antipode to venerated mainstream showbiz celebrities. Although he had never received any formal training (in acting) he managed to earn a great respect of both filmmakers and audience members. He performed in some 50 Slovak, Czech, German, Hungarian and UK/US movies, but he will be most remembered for portraying the lead character of Mikoláš in the Czech movie Marketa Lazarová. Biography and career Velecký was born 8 March 1934 in Zvolen. He originally studied civil engineering (highschool) and worked as a designer for few years. However, since his early age he was attracted by the world of cinema and finally in his 30s managed to get his first major roles. Practically at the beginning of his acting career, after a few minor films including Každý týždeň sedem dní (1964) and Nylonový mesiac (1965), he received the role of his lifetime in Marketa Lazarová (1966). This experience deeply influenced the rest of his life. In interviews, he described with gratitude how the director František Vláčil completely changed his way of seeing the world during the long production of this movie. Despite the impact the role had on the film (widely considered the best Czech cinema) and on his life, Velecký would probably be more recognized by Western audiences for his appearances in The Brothers Grimm (released 2005) and the Academy Award- nominated Želary (2003). For most of his career, Velecký was free of any theatre company ties except being briefly associated with the Theatre of Spišká Nová Ves in the 1980s. During his professional career, Velecký was not limited to acting. He was assistant director to Juraj Jakubisko on the film Zbehovia a pútnici (1968) and he applied his talent in fine arts during the 1990s. Velecký died of cancer 5 October 2003 in Bratislava.

The town lies on the Cetynia river, in the historical region of Podlachia and is the capital of Sokołów County. The first settlement was in the 6th century and the town received its charter in 1424. Population in 2004 was 18,434 (18,481 in 2010 and 18,720 in 2013).Ludność. Stan i struktura w przekroju terytorialnym (Stan w dniu 31 XII 2010 r.). Warszawa: Główny Urząd Statystyczny, 2011-06-10. ISSN 1734-6118.  History =Middle Ages and early modern era A pond in Sokołów Podlaski The beginnings of settlement in this area date back to 6th century AD. The Sokołów area belongs to that part of Podlachia, which, due to its location, was a typical settler outpost. This area in early Medieval time was a scene of the feudal fights between the Polish and Ruthenian states, the Teutonic Knights, Yotvingians and Lithuanians. Political history of this land strongly influenced its cultural development and progress of colonisation. Archaeological research to determinate the cultural and ethnic structure of the settlements discovered numerous archaeological sites from the early Middle Ages in the area, which allowed scientists to accurately reproduce the phases of colonisation process and the character of defensive and residential building structures of the settlements. The archaeologists found evidence of settlements in the area dating from 6th and 7th centuries. Ceramics, iron fittings, buckles, beads, staples and numerous items of burial equipment testify about the culture, customs and rituals celebrated to honour the dead. The study confirmed that in a place of old Russian and Polish settlements in the Cetynia river valley, as a result of gradual colonisation, new settlement at Sokołów was established. Sokołów Podlaski received city rights in 1424 from the Grand Duke of Lithuania Witold. In 1508 Stanisław Kiszka became the new owner of the town. Administratively Sokołów was part of the Podlaskie Voivodeship of the Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In 1580 King Stephen Báthory visited Sokołów. Sokołów belonged to Kiszka until 1592, when it was passed to the Radziwiłł family. For Sokołów it was a time of the greatest prosperity in its history, uninterrupted until the Swedish invasion in the middle of the 17th century. During the war with Sweden the city was significantly damaged. In 1657 Rakoczy's army burned down the town together with surrounding farms. During the Reformation, the city was one of the strongest centers of Arianism in Podlachia. In 1668 Jan Krasiński became the new owner of the town. After the second half of the 18th century the town belonged to the Ogiński family. Under their rule craftsmanship quickly developed in Sokołów. Michał Kleofas Ogiński brought French craftsmen who started the production of silk scarves, hats, rugs, linen and Slutsk sashes. Late modern era Polish insurgents by the Russians in 1865 After the Third Partition of Poland Sokołów fell under Austrian rule, and after the Polish-Austrian war, in 1809, became part of the Polish Duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it became part of Congress Poland, later on forcibly annexed by Russia. In 1833 the town was purchased from Michał Kleofas Ogiński by local landowner Karol Kobyloński, who 10 years later sold it to Elżbieta Hirschman. The new owner in 1845 established the sugar factory \\"Elżbietów\\" in Przeździatka (today on the western outskirts of Sokołów Podlaski) and in 1890, the factory employed 600 workers. The sugar factory played an important role for the development of the city and local agriculture. Historic buildings of the Elżbietów sugar factory During the January Insurrection local priest Stanisław Brzóska became a famous leader of the Polish resistance against Russian rule. He was arrested, sentenced by the tsarist authorities to death by hanging, and executed in the town centre on 23 May 1865. In 1925 a granite monument was erected as a memorial at the site of Brzóska's execution. In 1867 Sokołów became the property of the state and the district office was established there. In 1887, after the construction of the railway line, the city became an important communication link. Between 1845–1890 the population of the town doubled, mostly thanks to immigrants, the majority of which were Jews, who, being artisans, craftsmen and merchants, made a great contribution to the further development of the town. During this period new factories were opened in addition to the sugar factory. In 1915, during World War I, the Germans entered the city, ending the period of Russian rule, and the three-year period of German occupation began. Sokołów became part of Poland again in 1918, after the country declared independence. World War II German invasion of Poland in September 1939 During World War II Sokołów suffered heavy losses. As a result of the war 30% of residential and 70% of official buildings were destroyed and the population was drastically reduced. With the beginning of German occupation, many Jews fled. For those who left in August 1941 German authorities created a ghetto, which existed until the end of September 1942. A significant number of the Jewish population were killed in the ghetto and others transported to the Treblinka extermination camp. The liberation of the city took place on 8 August 1944. Post-war Poland District court with the Don Bosco church tower in the background Between 1951 and 1974 the electromechanical, chemical and furniture industries developed significantly. In 1975 a meat processing company was established, which over time, as Sokołów, became one of the largest companies in the Polish meat industry.

History  The family was known in Switzerland, particularly Bäretswil, since the middle of the 16th century. They migrated from Switzerland to the area around Sinsheim, Germany around 1651. In 1695 Hans Graff migrated to Pennsylvania. Hans Graff and his family were Mennonites and many of his descendants stayed in the Mennonite faith. Hans Graff bought in Groffdale, West Earl Township, Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The name Groffdale comes from Graff's family name.

It was established in February 1995 as a direct marketer and supplier of mobile phones and mobile phone accessories. The e-commerce website went online in September 2000. In 2008 it was acquired by Phones 4u who as of September 2014 collapsed into administration closing branches, online trading and call centres.  History  Dialaphone was founded in February 1995 by Jonathan Beck and Richard Frank with capital borrowed from Beck's father. While there was enough investment to fund telephone lines and recording equipment, the company had to carry out transactions without tracking software. Instead, Beck organised a system of trays and runners to keep track of orders during the company's early days. Initially, the business model relied entirely on direct phone calls generated from advertisements placed in the press, combined with efficient processing. Double page spreads in tabloids attracted consumers. During the late 1990s Dialaphone experienced rapid growth in a burgeoning market. This, along with the business’ minimal running costs, attracted the attentions of several investors. In 1999, a deal was made with Barclays Private Equity to take a majority share in the company in return for investment. This investment enabled the business to expand into the online area and develop a new website called www.dialaphone.co.uk. In May 1998, Dialaphone began its transition into an online business model with the launch of a dedicated e-commerce website. The website would soon become the business’ primary source of income. After extensive growth and moving to new premises the management teams were restructured and in the summer of 1999 a new Marketing Director, Finance Director and Managing Director were appointed. Andy Brown, who had formerly worked under John Caudwell at Phones 4u, was brought on board as Managing Director and began pursuing other avenues of marketing, using scratchcards, catalogues and TV advertising. Dialaphone became more involved in sponsorship and was the primary shirt sponsor of Middlesbrough Football Club from 2002 to 2004. In 2011, Dialaphone became the Official Mobile Partner of Premier League Darts, sponsored the Rugby League Challenge Cup and in 2012 was set to become the Official Online Mobile Phone Sponsor of the Football League. Dialaphone became the third largest contract connector in the UK. After seven years, Andy Brown parted company with Frank and Beck in April 2006 following differences over the future direction of the business. The company had reportedly made a turnover of £195m during the past year and was one of the largest online mobile phone retailers in the country.http://www.mobiletoday.co.uk/News/2528/____________Dial-A- Phone_pressure.aspx Despite its early success Dialaphone's contract volume dwindled, and it was bought by one-time competitor Phones 4u for a knockdown price in February 2008. The fee was reported to be around £9m. On 14 September 2014, the Dial-A-Phone website was taken offline following the parent company, Phones 4u going into administration.  Products  Dialaphone's products included feature phones and smartphones from all the major manufacturers, which were available on the UK's main networks. Dialaphone offered customers a range of free gifts, usually personal electronic goods, and cashback with certain tariffs and handsets.  Environment  Dialaphone was partnered with mobile recycling service Money4URMobile which offers incentives for customers to recycle their old mobile phone.

Dom Miguel's rebel forces were defeated. Miguel's army, under the command of General Guedes, had been retreating eastward before the advance of Dom Pedro's forces, and had camped in a strong position on the Heights of Asseiceira, a system of hills and valleys about four miles from Tomar. Miguel himself was at Santarém and was not involved in the ensuing battle. Pedro's general, the Duke of Terceira, advanced from Tomar on the morning of the 16th and attacked their position in three columns commanded by Colonels Queirós, Nepomuceno and Vasconcelos. The Miguelite forces attempted to repel them with artillery bombardment and cavalry charges but the loyalist forces persisted in their attacks and eventually a charge by their own cavalry carried the heights. Many of the enemy were killed or wounded, their guns captured, and some 1400 men taken prisoner. The remainder fled towards Golegã, which was occupied by Terceira the following day. Dom Pedro (already ill with the sickness that would kill him shortly after his final victory) arrived there on the 18th from Cartaxo. Miguel rallied his forces at Évora, but his officers were unwilling to risk a final battle after nearly two years of warfare, and he was presently induced to seek terms of capitulation. The war would finally end ten days later with the signing of the Concession of Evoramonte, where Dom Miguel surrendered and abandoned his claim to the Portuguese throne, being also banished from the kingdom.

'pleasure' or 'delight', v. 'to end' or 'to conclude') is a term used in Hinduism and Sikhism. In Sikhism, it is used for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the Guru Granth Sahib. It can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries, funeral services and other occasions when a family or a worshipping community may consider such a reading appropriate. In Hinduism Bhog in the Hindu religion is food given to the Gods. In Sikhism The term Bhog is used in the Sikh religion for observances that are fulfilled along with the reading of the concluding part of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The reading of this holy scripture is done on a day-to-day basis with a staff of readers at a major worship centre. The community generally relates 'Bhog' to an uninterrupted and complete reading of their holy book (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji). This usually takes days to complete through a relay of readers who work round-the-clock. This is also called the Akhand Path. This type of path and hence the 'Bhog' as it comes to its end, can be performed in conjunction with weddings, obsequies, anniversaries and other occasions, when a family or a worship community might consider such reading to be appropriate. Bhog also takes place when a family or a community decides to go for a slower reading of the holy scripture (Sahaj Path). The reading is done as and when circumstances permit. The 'Bhog' comes at its end and has to be recited in a single session, without a break. Another variation is the Saptahik Path, in which the reading of the scripture has to be completed within a week. The Sahaj Path may continue for months. 'Bhog' is a derivative from the Sanskrit word \\"Bhoga\\" and as a verb it means 'to end' or 'to conclude'. It is generally used to denote a funeral service. The Karah Prasad that is distributed at the end of any congregational service might also be termed 'Bhog'. An occasion of joy or sorrow, prompt a Sikh householder to follow the path of the Holy Book, preferred by himself or his family. If this is not possible, then Pathis or scripture-readers are invited for this purpose. The assignation of the time period is often announced at a local Gurudwara during the Sangat. Notices might be placed in the newspapers. In the case of Saptahik Paths, the reader reads the entire Holy Book except for the last five pages. This is when the Karah Prasad is prepared. The unread portion is continued after the 'inaugural hymns'. The Pathi would start slowly and would read Guru Teg Bahadur's 57 couplets, Mundavani and a Sloka (or a hymn) by Guru Arjan. The Ragamala follows this. The Mundavani is an essential part and is like a seal to the scripture. It reiterates the essentials of the teachings of the book - Sat(ya) (the truth), santokh (contentment), vichar (wisdom) and the remembrance to the Holy name (Nam). The Ardas is read after the reading is completed. Ardas has its own powerful associations brought into bhog. These include recalling the glorious past of the Sikhs: their heroism, devotion, martyrdom and marking the present Khalsa. After the Ardas, the Hukam or command for the day is obtained by reading out the hymn offered by the text which is naturally interpreted in the context of the intention of the path, that is, as the word of the Guru to those receiving it at that point, with their purposes particularly in mind, be it a family event, a funeral, a wedding, or invocation for blessing on a new venture. In West Bengal In West Bengal and neighboring regions, Bhog is commonly distributed in major festivals like the Durga Puja, Kali Puja, Saraswati Puja and other community poojas. It is commonly served in large temple complexes. The bhog is a blessed food that doubles up as a complete meal as opposed to prasad, which in West Bengal, would be in smaller quantity and would not be intended to be a meal. A most common form of bhog is in the form of Khichdi, served with a semi dry vegetable preparation, sweet tomato chutney and payesh (kheer), which is a rice pudding. This is typically served on flat plates of leaves of Sal (tree) joined together with small twigs, all of which are then discarded.

It consists of a donburi type large bowl filled with steamed white rice, and topped with fillets of eel (unagi) grilled in a style known as kabayaki, similar to teriyaki. The fillets are glazed with a sweetened soy-based sauce, called tare and caramelized, preferably over charcoal fire. The fillets are not flayed, and the grayish skin side is placed faced down., p.63 Sufficient tare sauce is poured over so that some of it seeps through the rice underneath. By convention, pulverized dried berries of sanshō (called Japanese pepper, although botanically unrelated) are sprinkled on top as seasoning. Variations Variations include unajū (鰻重, the same dish served in jūbako (重箱), food boxes often lacquered), nagayaki (長焼き, the eel and rice are served separately), and hitsumabushi (櫃まぶし). There are two styles of grilled eel, the topic of which is covered more precisely under kabayaki. Essentially, in the Kantō region style, the eel is steamed before being grilled with sauce, which makes the eel more tender., p.144- The other is the Kansai region style, which is grilled without steaming. History Una-don was the first type of donburi rice dish, invented in the late Edo period, during the Bunka era (1804–1818), section \\"Una-don, the First Donburi-mono\\", p.24- by a man named of Sakai-machi (in present-day Nihonbashi Ningyōchō, Chūō, Tokyo), and became a hit in the neighborhood, where the Nakamura-za and Ichimura-za once stood.

After the great famine of 1844, it started selling the unadon for one oblong Tenpō-sen coin, and became a hit. As for unajū, where the eel and rice is stuffed in jūbako boxes, one theory ascribes its originator to one , who started a freshwater fish restaurant business in Sanya, Asakusa, Tokyo, called (later known as Jūbako, the current generation of the restaurant is in Akasaka). According to this version the unajū was already around by late Edo period, but there are detractors to this view., p.?, the author claims to have heard from the current successor to the restaurant that it was not the original innovator to put eel in jubako, and the old restaurant in Sanya was so named because the architecture resembled the jubako boxes Other commentators say unajū appeared in the Taishō era, and by using lacquered boxes, aimed at appearance of luxury.

He was a member of the famed \\"Fighting McCook\\" family of Ohio. Four of his brothers and 10 of his first cousins served as officers, with six of the family members becoming generals before the end of the war. Early life and career McCook was born in Steubenville, Ohio, on June 15, 1833. As a young man, he moved to the Kansas Territory and became a lawyer. He joined the Pike's Peak Gold Rush in 1859 and represented the Pikes Peak region in the Kansas Territorial House of Representatives. Civil War With the onset of the Civil War in 1861, McCook traveled to Washington, D.C., and served for a time as a secret agent for the federal government, gathering information of value to the military. He then enlisted as a cavalry lieutenant in the regular army. He then joined the volunteer army as a captain in the 2nd Indiana Cavalry, rising to the rank of colonel by the middle of 1862. McCook commanded a cavalry brigade at the Battle of Perryville and a division at Chickamauga. On April 27, 1864, he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and given command of the First Cavalry Division in the Army of the Cumberland. His 3,600 cavalrymen raided and severed the Macon & Western Railroad in late July 1864 while serving under George Stoneman during the Atlanta Campaign. One of his goals was to release the 32,000 prisoners of war being held in the Andersonville Prison. However, as they tried to return to the main army on July 30, McCook was thoroughly defeated by Confederate cavalry under Joseph Wheeler at the Battle of Brown's Mill near Newnan, Georgia, losing 950 men, 1,200 horses and two pieces of artillery. During Stoneman's raid, McCook gained a reputation for condoning and encouraging the destruction of civilian property. McCook and his remaining cavalry marched to Tennessee to assist George H. Thomas's efforts to stymie the Confederates under John Bell Hood. He served with distinction in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign. In March and April 1865, as the war near its close, McCook commanded the First Division in Wilson's Raid through Alabama and Georgia, as well as at the Battle of Selma, where the federal cavalry dealt a crushing defeat upon Nathan Bedford Forrest. In early May, McCook's division was assigned to re-establish federal control and authority in Florida, whose ardent secessionist governor, John Milton, had shot himself in the head rather than submit to Union occupation. On May 13, Col. George Washington Scott surrendered the last active Confederate troops in the state to McCook. On May 20, McCook read Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation during a ceremony in Tallahassee, officially ending slavery in Florida. That same day, his jubilant troopers raised the U.S. flag over the state capitol. McCook reached the rank of brevet major general in the volunteers by the end of the war, and received the official praise of his superior, James H. Wilson. While not a professionally trained soldier, McCook was efficient and brave. He received a total of five brevet promotions in the Civil War, all for gallantry and meritorious service. Postbellum career He returned to the regular army when his volunteers were mustered out following the war. In 1866, McCook resigned from the army and returned to civilian life. President Andrew Johnson appointed McCook to serve as the U.S. Minister to the Kingdom of Hawaii from 1866 through 1868. In 1869, President Ulysses S. Grant appointed McCook Governor of the Territory of Colorado, a selection bitterly opposed by Jerome B. Chaffee, the Colorado Territorial Delegate to the United States House of Representatives. During his tenure, Governor McCook signed the legislation that created Colorado Agricultural College (now Colorado State University) and was among the first territorial governors to endorse women's suffrage. He was a member of the Republican National Committee in 1872. McCook left the governorship when his second term expired in 1875 and turned to various business pursuits. He became very wealthy from numerous shrewd investments in real estate, mining interests and in new European telephone companies. For a time, he paid more income and business taxes than any man in Colorado. McCook died in Chicago, Illinois, and is buried in Union Cemetery in Steubenville. The city of McCook, Nebraska, was named in honor of his cousin Alexander McDowell McCook.

The bridge was proposed in the early 20th century as part of a plan to link Chicago's south side and north side parks with a grand boulevard. Construction of the bridge started in 1918, it opened to traffic in 1920, and decorative work was completed in 1928. The bridge provides passage for vehicles and pedestrians on two levels. An example of a fixed trunnion bascule bridge (which is also known as a \\"Chicago style bascule bridge\\"), it may be raised to allow tall ships and boats to pass underneath. The bridge is included in the Michigan–Wacker Historic District and has been designated as a Chicago Landmark. The location is significant in the early history of Chicago, connecting on the north near the 1780s homestead site of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable and on the south the early 19th century site of Fort Dearborn. Events from the city's past are commemorated with sculptures and plaques on the bridge, and exhibits in the McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum—housed in one of the bridge tender houses—detail the history of the Chicago River. Location The Michigan Avenue Bridge has a north–south orientation, spanning the main stem of the Chicago River between the Near North Side and Loop community areas of Chicago. Its northern portal lies at the foot of the Magnificent Mile, between the Wrigley Building and Tribune Tower. Its southern portal is at the intersection of Michigan Avenue and Wacker Drive, overlooked by the London Guarantee Building and 333 North Michigan. The neighboring bridges are Columbus Drive Bridge to the east and Wabash Avenue Bridge to the west. The bridge is situated in a historically significant area. The northern end of the bridge covers part of the Jean Baptiste Point Du Sable Homesite, which is commemorated by a National Historic plaque in Pioneer Court. The southern half of the bridge passes over the site of Fort Dearborn, which was constructed in 1803. The Fort is commemorated by a large relief above the entrance of the London Guarantee Building, and brass markers positioned in the sidewalks on the south side of the bridge delineate the posited outline of the original blockhouse. Name The historical significance of the location has been used as the basis for a number of proposals to rename the bridge. In 1921 the Chicago Historical Society suggested that the bridge should be named Marquette–Joliet Bridge, and in 1939 it was proposed to rename the bridge as Fort Dearborn Bridge. These proposals were not adopted. In October 2010, the bridge was renamed DuSable Bridge in honor of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable, Chicago's first permanent resident. A fur trader of African descent who married into the Potawatomi tribe, he established a permanent homestead and trading post near the mouth of the Chicago River in the 1780s. History Michigan Boulevard and bridge, as proposed in Burnham & Bennett's 1909 Plan of Chicago, looking north from Grant Park A boulevard to link the parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river. In 1903 an editorial in the Chicago Tribune proposed a new bascule bridge across the river at Michigan Avenue. Other plans suggested that the bridge should be a replica of the Pont Alexandre III that spans the Seine in Paris, or that, rather than constructing an entirely new bridge, the existing Rush Street bridge should be double- decked. Plans for the boulevard and the construction of a Michigan Avenue Bridge were further elaborated upon in Daniel Burnham's 1909 Plan of Chicago. In 1911 a plan was selected that included the widening of Michigan Avenue from Randolph Street to the river, replacing the Rush Street bridge with a new bridge at Michigan Avenue and the construction of a double-decked boulevard along Pine Street as far as Ohio Street. An ordinance to fund construction was passed in 1913, but was declared void by the Supreme Court of Illinois. A second ordinance was passed in 1914, but legal battles continued until the end of 1916. Construction finally started on April 15, 1918, and the bridge was officially opened in a ceremony on May 14, 1920. The bridge is one of the contributing properties of the Michigan–Wacker Historic District, which was listed as on the National Register of Historic Places on November 15, 1978. It was also designated as a Chicago Landmark on October 2, 1991. In 2009 the sidewalks and railings on the bridge were replaced, and the bridge was repainted; the design of the new ornamental railings was based on the original 1920 design for the bridge's railings, replacing more utilitarian ones that had been substituted at a later date. Design and operation Michigan Avenue Bridge is a double-leaf, double-deck, fixed counterweight, trunnion bascule bridge. It was engineered by the Chicago Department of Public Works, Bureau of Engineering; Edward H. Bennett was the consulting architect and William A. Mulcahy the chief engineer of construction. At the time of construction it was believed to be the first double-deck bridge ever built to have roadway on both levels; faster non-commercial traffic using the upper deck and slower commercial traffic that served the various industries and docks in the vicinity of the river using the lower deck. The Michigan Avenue Bridge is raised twice weekly in the spring and fall to allow tall craft to winter near the river and have summer moorings on Lake Michigan harbors. Each of the bridge's leaves is divided into two along the axis of the bridge such that it functions as two parallel bridges that can be operated independently of one another; at the time of construction bridges over the Chicago River were frequently struck by vessels, and this duplex arrangement allows for leaves damaged in such a collision to be opened for repair without needing to completely close the bridge to traffic. The counterweights are below the level of the lower deck and when the bridge is opened they swing down into reinforced concrete tailpits that descend below the surface of the river. Each of the two tailpits is supported on nine cylindrical foundation piers. One of these piers was sunk to bedrock, below the river surface, the other 17 piers are sunk to the hardpan, which is below the water level. On the south side of the river one of the freight tunnels of the Chicago Tunnel Company had to be re-routed to make room for the tailpit. The counterweights are composed partly of concrete and partly of a concrete composite with rivet punchings; each of the four counterweights weighs . The Michigan Avenue Bridge is made of steel. The bridge can carry about 30,000 people daily. The bridge abutments and the facing of the bridge tender houses are made of Bedford stone. There are four bridge tender houses: the northwest and southeast bridgehouses house the controls for operating the bridge; the northeast and southwest bridgehouses are purely decorative. Two motors open and close each of the bridge leaves. Originally the bridge was staffed 24 hours a day, and opened up to 3,000 times a year to allow ships through, but since the 1970s bridge lifting has been scheduled in the spring and fall, when the bridge is raised twice weekly to allow sailboats to pass between Lake Michigan and inland boat yards where they are stored for the winter. Decoration In 1928, sculptures depicting scenes from Chicago's history were added to the outward-facing walls of the four bridgehouses. The sculptures on the northern bridgehouses were commissioned by William Wrigley Jr. and made by James Earle Fraser: The Discoverers depicts Louis Joliet, Jacques Marquette, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti; The Pioneers depicts John Kinzie leading a group through the wilderness. The sculptures on the southern bridgehouses were commissioned by the Benjamin F. Ferguson Monument Fund, and are by Henry Hering: Defense depicts Ensign George Ronan in a scene from the 1812 Battle of Fort Dearborn; Regeneration depicts workers rebuilding Chicago after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The bridge is also bedecked with 28 flagpoles, usually flying the flags of the United States, Illinois and Chicago. On special occasions other banners may be displayed. McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum Entrance to the Bridgehouse Museum The southwest bridgehouse has been converted into a museum, with its entrance off the Chicago Riverwalk. The McCormick Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum is a 5-floor, museum that opened on June 10, 2006; it is named for Robert R. McCormick, formerly owner of the Chicago Tribune and president of the Chicago Sanitary District. The Robert R. McCormick Foundation was the major donor that helped to provide the $950,000 cost of the formation of the museum. It is run by the Friends of the Chicago River, and includes exhibits on the history of the Chicago River and the bridge. Visitors are also allowed to access the bridge's gear room; during the spring and fall bridge lifting, visitors can see the bridge gears in operation as the leaves are raised and lowered. Due to its small size and tight access stairway, only 79 people are allowed inside the museum at any one time. In July 2019, the museum welcomed its 250,000th guest. In October 2019, Chicago Tribune cultural arts writer Steve Johnson called the museum's gear room, where the DuSable Bridge mechanics can be viewed working, \\"a little chamber of heaven for infrastructure nerds.\\"  See also  *Historic Michigan Boulevard District *List of bridges documented by the Historic American Engineering Record in Illinois *Multilevel streets in Chicago References=NotesReferencesBibliography  * External links * McCormick Tribune Bridgehouse & Chicago River Museum Category:1920 establishments in Illinois Category:Bascule bridges in the United States Category:Bridges completed in 1920 Category:Bridges in Chicago Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Illinois Category:Chicago Landmarks Category:Road bridges in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Chicago Category:Road bridges on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Steel bridges in the United States ","title":"DuSable Bridge"},{"id":"4423757","text":"Borovec may refer to: In Bulgaria: *Borovets, a mountain resort situated in the Province of Sofia In Macedonia: * , a village near Struga In Slovenia: *Borovec pri Kočevski Reki, a settlement in the Municipality of Kočevje *Borovec pri Karlovici, a settlement in the Municipality of Velike Lašče ","title":"Borovec"},{"id":"4423764","text":"Brzeziny (; , Brezin) is a town in Poland, in Łódź Voivodeship, about 20 km east of Łódź. It is the capital of Brzeziny County and has a population of 12,514 (2016). It once was a thriving Jewish shtetl noted for its tailors.  History  The first settlement on the site of the present town of Brzeziny was during the 13th Century. The first documentary evidence of the town charter dates from 1332. The town played an important role in the development of trade between Russia and the Polish town of Toruń from the 15th to 17th centuries. Of particular economic importance was craft and tailoring. Brzeziny was one of the oldest Jewish settlements in Poland, and was known as Krakówek (\\"Little Krakow\\"). Polish noblewoman Anna Łasocka brought the first Jewish weavers to Brzeziny, and in 1547 was the first reference to a Jewish population. In 1793, following the Second Partition of Poland, the town and region was annexed into the Kingdom of Prussia as South Prussia. In July 1807, following the Treaty of Tilsit, the town was transferred to the Duchy of Warsaw and after June 1815, became part of the Russian Congress Poland to 1916. During World War I Austrian and German armies were very active in the region. The Prussian General Karl Litzmann won an important battle here against the Russian army and earned the nickname \\"the lion of Brzeziny\\". From November 1916, with Poland mostly occupied by Austrian and German armies, the autonomous Regency Kingdom of Poland (Królestwo Regencyjne) governed the area until the declaration of the Second Polish Republic in 1918. Beginning in 1939 and the German occupation of Poland in World War II the entire region was part of the notorious Reichsgau Wartheland governed by SS Obergruppenfuhrer Arthur Greiser. The town was renamed Löwenstadt to honour Karl Litzmann. A ghetto was established in early 1940 and about 6000 Brzeziny Jews were imprisoned there. Many died there of starvation, disease, and murder by the Germans. Some Poles tried to help by smuggling food into the ghetto. In 1942, hundreds of elderly, sick, and mothers with children were sent to Chelmno and were immediately gassed. Others were deported to the Lodz ghetto where most died or were sent to Auschwitz later. About 200 to 300 of the 6850 Jews living in Brzeziny at the beginning of the war survived. On 18 January 1945 the Red Army reached Brzeziny.

Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, for active drug resistant tuberculosis. It is given by mouth. Common side effects include allergic reactions, seizures, sleepiness, unsteadiness, and numbness. It is not recommended in people who have kidney failure, epilepsy, depression, or are alcoholics. It is unclear if use during pregnancy is safe for the baby. Cycloserine is similar in structure to the amino acid D-alanine and works by interfering with the formation of the bacteria's cell wall. Cycloserine was discovered in 1954 from a type of Streptomyces. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Medical uses=Tuberculosis For the treatment of tuberculosis, cycloserine is classified as a second-line drug, i.e. its use is only considered if one or more first-line drugs cannot be used. Hence, cycloserine is restricted for use only against multiple drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Another reason for limited use of this drug is the neurological side effects it causes, since it is able to penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS) and cause headaches, drowsiness, depression, dizziness, vertigo, confusion, paresthesias, dysarthria, hyperirritability, psychosis, convulsions, and shaking (tremors). Overdose of cycloserine may result in paresis, seizures, and coma, while alcohol consumption may increase the risk of seizures. Coadministration of pyridoxine can reduce the incidence of some of these CNS side effects (e.g. convulsions) caused by cycloserine. Psychiatry A 2015 Cochrane review found no evidence of benefit in anxiety disorders as of 2015. Another review found preliminary evidence of benefit. Evidence for use in addiction is tentative but also unclear. Mechanism of action Cycloserine works as an antibiotic by inhibiting cell- wall biosynthesis in bacteria. As a cyclic analogue of D-alanine, cycloserine acts against two crucial enzymes important in the cytosolic stages of peptidoglycan synthesis: alanine racemase (Alr) and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (Ddl). The first enzyme is a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme which converts the L-alanine to the D-alanine form. The second enzyme is involved in joining two of these D-alanine residues together by catalyzing the formation of the ATP-dependent D-alanine-D-alanine dipeptide bond between the resulting D-alanine molecules. If both of these enzymes are inhibited, then D-alanine residues cannot form and previously formed D-alanine molecules cannot be joined together. This effectively leads to inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis. Chemical properties Under mildly acidic conditions, cycloserine hydrolyzes to give hydroxylamine and D-serine. Cycloserine can be conceptualized as a cyclized version of serine, with an oxidative loss of dihydrogen to form the nitrogen-oxygen bond. Cycloserine is stable under basic conditions, with the greatest stability at pH = 11.5. History The compound was first isolated nearly simultaneously by two teams. Workers at Merck isolated the compound, which they called oxamycin, from a species of Streptomyces. The same team prepared the molecule synthetically. Workers at Eli Lilly isolated the compound from strains of Streptomyces orchidaceus. It was shown to hydrolyze to serine and hydroxylamine. Economics In the U.S., the price of cycloserine increased from $500 for 30 pills to $10,800 in 2015 after the Chao Center for Industrial Pharmacy and Contract Manufacturing changed ownership to Rodelis Therapeutics in August 2015. The price increase was rescinded after the previous owner, the Purdue University Research Foundation, which retained \\"oversight of the manufacturing operation\\" intervened and Rodelis returned the drug to an NGO of Purdue University. The foundation now will charge $1,050 for 30 capsules, twice what it charged before\\". Eli Lilly has been criticised for not ensuring that the philanthropic initiative continued. Due to US antitrust laws however, no company may control the price of a product after it is outlicensed. In 2015, the cost in the United States was increased to a month and then decreased to per month. Research There is some experimental evidence to suggest that D-cycloserine aids in learning by helping form stronger neural connections. It has been investigated as an aid to facilitate exposure therapy in people with PTSD and anxiety disorders as well as treatment with schizophrenia.

In 1936, Ritter was appointed head of the Racial Hygiene and Demographic Biology Research Unit of Nazi Germany's Criminal Police, to establish the genealogical histories of the German \\"Gypsies\\", both Roma and Sinti, and became the \\"architect of the experiments Roma and Sinti were subjected to.\\"The Guardian, 27 October 2019 nazi directives accounts and directives go on display His pseudo-scientific \\"research\\" in classifying these populations of Germany aided the Nazi government in their systematic persecution toward a goal of \\"racial purity\\".  Early life  Ritter was born in 1901 in Aachen, Germany. He attended an exclusive secondary school, as well as a Prussian military academy. After a stint in the German Freikorps, Ritter began his formal education studying at various universities. In 1927, Ritter received his doctorate in educational psychology at the University of Munich. Post-doctorate, Ritter continued his education and received a medical degree from Heidelberg University in 1930, and was medically licensed the same year. In 1934, two years before being appointed as head of the German police's racial hygiene research unit, Ritter received his specialist certification in child psychology, studying the inheritability of criminality. He completed part of his residence in the University of Tübingen. Career= Ritter and the Sterilization Law of 1933  Nazi seizure of power in 1933 allowed the party to transform their ideology of racial purity into policy. The Law for the Prevention of Genetically Diseased Offspring was put into effect New Year's Day, 1934, and included compulsory sterilization of individuals who, according to medical knowledge, were likely to pass on to their offspring a serious physical or mental disorder. Besides a diagnosed medical disorder, citizens would also be sterilized for being classified as asocial. An asocial diagnosis was often associated with having \\"moral\\" or \\"disguised mental retardation\\", despite showing no deficit in intelligence. Ritter was responsible for the invention \\"disguised mental retardation\\". According to Ritter, individuals, especially children with this alleged disorder displayed a certain independence and cunning and were quick talkers. \\"Disguised mental retardation\\" supposedly carried a mask of cleverness, which the pseudo- scientific medical specialists characterized as mental retardation: if they couldn't actually observe and demonstrate a mental problem, they simply insisted it was present anyway, and that evidence of its opposite was some kind of trick. The Nazi government used this alleged disorder as a justification to sterilize an estimated 500 Roma and Sinti individuals between 1933 and 1939.  Methods of research  The task of the Rassenhygienische und Bevolkerungsbiologische Forschungsstelle (), a division of the Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police), was to identify and categorize all Roma and Sinti people in Germany according to racial standards. Ritter, heading this organization, had a team of other racial scientists including Eva Justin, Adolf Wurth, Sophie Ehrhardt, and Ruth Kellermann. Ritter (right) taking blood from a woman, 1936 By 1937, the Research Unit was working with the Central Office of Reich Security, and the Reich Ministry of Interior, to travel across Germany in units to register \\"full-blooded\\" and \\"mixed-race\\" Roma or Sinti. The units referenced church records to track individuals' genealogies. As some of Ritter's assistants spoke Romani, they would interrogate Roma individuals who could not provide paper proof of their racial identity. Anyone who balked was threatened with incarceration. Along with tracking genealogies, the units photographed their subjects, took blood samples, and made anthropometric measurements. Ritter wanted the data to prove that the Roma and Sinti populations were genetically pre-disposed to crime as a \\"lesser race\\".  Ritter's racial hypotheses  Ritter desired to classify the Roma and Sinti populations for legislative precedent. In Germany, he considered there to be three groups: Jenische, part-Gypsies, and pure Gypsies. * Jenische referred to \\"white gypsies\\", the mobile, marginalized poor of Central Europe, a population not thought to have non-European origins. * Pure Gypsies meant the itinerant people of a non-European race. While originally from India and with a language related to Sanskrit, they possessed true Aryan origins. However, Ritter rejected this argument for all but approximately ten percent of the Roma and Sinti population. * Part-Gypsies were classified by Ritter as persons who had one or two Gypsies among their grandparents. Further, a person was classed as part-Gypsy if two or more of his grandparents are part-Gypsy. Often it meant mixed-race individuals of Gypsy plus Jenische lineage. Ritter felt the racially pure gypsies of Germany were not as large a threat to the German population as those of mixed-race identity. He argued that the best way to deal with pure gypsie was to allow them to live a traditional life, sectioned off from the rest of the population. His study of criminality and \\"race- threat\\" focused on Jenische and mixed-race gypsies instead.  Ritter in post- Nazi Germany  Despite the Denazification of Germany after World War II, Ritter was not required to take responsibility for his actions towards the Roma and Sinti population during Nazi rule. All investigations against Ritter were discontinued. Ritter was hired to teach criminal biology at the University of Tübingen from 1944 to 1946, and was later brought in by the Frankfurt Health Office as a pediatrician. He hired his former assistant, Eva Justin, to work with him as a psychologist.  References  *Crowe, David M. (1994). A History of the Gypsies of Eastern Europe and Russia.

Methane monooxygenase belongs to the class of oxidoreductase enzymes (). There are two forms of MMO: the well-studied soluble form (sMMO) and the particulate form (pMMO). The active site in sMMO contains a di-iron center bridged by an oxygen atom (Fe-O-Fe), whereas the active site in pMMO utilizes copper. Structures of both proteins have been determined by X-ray crystallography; however, the location and mechanism of the active site in pMMO is still poorly understood and is an area of active research. The particulate methane monooxygenase and related ammonia monooxygenase are integral membrane proteins, occurring in methanotrophs and ammonia oxidisers, respectively, which are thought to be related. These enzymes have a relatively wide substrate specificity and can catalyse the oxidation of a range of substrates including ammonia, methane, halogenated hydrocarbons, and aromatic molecules. These enzymes are homotrimers composed of 3 subunits - A (), B () and C () and most contain two monocopper centers. The A subunit from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) resides primarily within the membrane and consists of 7 transmembrane helices and a beta-hairpin, which interacts with the soluble region of the B subunit. A conserved glutamate residue is thought to contribute to a metal center. Methane monooxygenases are found in methanotrophic bacteria, a class of bacteria that exist at the interface of aerobic (oxygen-containing) and anaerobic (oxygen-devoid) environments. One of the more widely studied bacteria of this type is Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). This bacterium was discovered in the hot springs of Bath, England.  Soluble methane monooxygenase (MMO) systems  Methanotrophic bacteria play an essential role of cycling carbon through anaerobic sediments. The chemistry behind the cycling takes a chemically inert hydrocarbon, methane, and converts it to a more active species, methanol. Other hydrocarbons are oxidized by MMOs, so a new hydroxylation catalyst based on the understanding of MMO systems could possibly make a more efficient use of the world supply of natural gas. This is a classic monooxygenase reaction in which two reducing equivalents from NAD(P)H are utilized to split the O-O bond of O2. One atom is reduced to water by a 2 e- reduction and the second is incorporated into the substrate to yield methanol: CH4 \\\\+ O2 \\\\+ NAD(P)H + H+ -> CH3OH + NAD(P)+ \\\\+ H2O Two forms of MMO have been found: soluble and particulate. The best characterized forms of soluble MMO contains three protein components: hydroxylase, the β unit, and the reductase. Each of which is necessary for effective substrate hydroxylation and NADH oxidation.  Structure  The resting, oxidized, and reduced state of the diiron core. X-ray crystallography of the MMO shows that it is a dimer formed of three subunits, α2β2γ2. With 2.2 A resolution, the crystallography shows that MMO is a relatively flat molecule with the dimensions of 60 x 100 x 120 A. In addition, there is a wide canyon running along the dimer interface with an opening in the center of the molecule. Most of the protomers involves helices from the α and β subunits with no participation from the γ subunit. Also, the interactions with the protomers resembles ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein dimer interaction, resembling a heart. Each iron has a six coordinate octahedral environment. The dinuclear iron centers are positioned in the α subunit. Each iron atoms are also coordinated to a histidine δN atom, Fe 1 to a His 147 and Fe 2 to His 246, Fe 1 is a ligated to a monodentate carboxylate, Glu 114, a semi bridging caboxylate, Glu 144, and a water molecule. The substrate must bind near the active site in order for the reaction to take place. Near to the iron centers, there are hydrophobic pockets. It is thought that here the methane binds and is held until needed. From the X-ray crystallography, there is no direct path to these packets. However, a slight conformation change in the Phe 188 or The 213 side-chains could allow access. This conformational change could be triggered by the binding of a coupling protein and the activase. Upon reduction, one of the carboxylate ligands undergoes a “1,2 carboxylate” shift from behind a terminal monodentate ligand to a bridging ligand for the two irons, with the second oxygen coordinated to Fe 2. In the reduced form of MMOHred, the ligand environment for the Fe effectively becomes five coordinated, a form that permits the cluster to activate dioxygen. The two irons are at this point oxidized to FeIV and have changed from low-spin ferromagnetic to high-spin antiferromagnetic.  Proposed catalytic cycle and mechanism  The proposed catalytic Cycle for MMO. From the MMOHred, the diiron centers react with the O2 to form intermediate P. This intermediate is a peroxide species where the oxygens are bound symmetrically, suggested by spectroscopic studies. However, the structure is not known. Intermediate P then converts to intermediate Q, which was proposed to contain two antiferromagnetically coupled high-spin FeIV centers. This compound Q with its diamond core is critical to the oxidizing species for MMO. There are two mechanisms suggested for the reaction between compound Q and the alkane: radical and nonradical. The radical mechanism starts with abstraction of the hydrogen atom from the substrate to form QH (the rate determining step), hydroxyl bridged compound Q and the free alkyl radical. The nonradical mechanism implies a concerted pathway, occurring via a four-center transition state and leading to a “hydrido-alkyl-Q” compound. As of 1999, the research suggests that the methane oxidation proceeds via a bound-radical mechanism. It was suggested that the transition state for the radical mechanism involves a torsion motion of the hydroxyl OH ligand before the methyl radical can add to the bridging hydroxyl ligand to form the alcohol. As the radical approaches, the H atom of the alkane leave the coplanar tricoordinate O environment and bends upward to create a tetrahedral tetracoordinate O environment. The final step for this reaction is the elimination of the alcohol and the regeneration of the catalysts. There are a few ways in which this can occur. It could be a stepwise mechanism that starts with the elimination of the alcohol and an intermediate Fe-O-Fe core, and the latter can eliminate the water and regenerate the enzyme through a 2e- reduction. On the other hand, it can start with a 2e- reduction process of bridging the O1 atom to give a water molecule, followed by elimination of the alcohol and regeneration of the enzyme. In addition, it is possible that there is a concerted mechanism whereby the elimination of the methanol occurs spontaneously with 2e- reduction of the bridging O1 center and regeneration of the catalyst.

A review of recent evidence. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 13, 775-784 This disorder is also distinguished from schizophrenia by a lower hereditary occurrence, less premorbid maladjustment, and a slower rate of progression.Casanova, M. F. (2010). The pathology of paraphrenia. Current Psychiatry Reports, 12, 196-201. Onset of symptoms generally occurs later in life, near the age of 60. The prevalence of the disorder among the elderly is between 0.1% and 4%. Paraphrenia is not included in the DSM-5; psychiatrists often diagnose patients presenting with paraphrenia as having atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults. Recently, mental health professionals have also been classifying paraphrenia as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis. In the Russian psychiatric manuals, paraphrenia (or paraphrenic syndrome) is the last stage of development of paranoid schizophrenia. \\"Systematized paraphrenia\\" (with systematized delusions i. e. delusions with complex logical structure) and \\"expansive-paranoid paraphrenia\\" (with expansive/grandiose delusions and persecutory delusions) are the variants of paranoid schizophrenia (). Sometimes systematized paraphrenia can be seen with delusional disorder (). The word is from – beside, near + φρήν – intellect, mind.  Signs and symptoms  The main symptoms of paraphrenia are paranoid delusions and hallucinations.Kay, D. W., & Roth, M. (1961). Environmental and hereditary factors in schizophrenias of old-age (late paraphrenia) and their bearing on general problem of causation in schizophrenia. Journal of Mental Science, 107, 649. The delusions often involve the individual being the subject of persecution, although they can also be erotic, hypochondriacal, or grandiose in nature. The majority of hallucinations associated with paraphrenia are auditory, with 75% of patients reporting such an experience; however, visual, tactile, and olfactory hallucinations have also been reported. The paranoia and hallucinations can combine in the form of “threatening or accusatory voices coming from neighbouring houses [and] are frequently reported by the patients as disturbing and undeserved\\". Patients also present with a lack of symptoms commonly found in other mental disorders similar to paraphrenia. There is no significant deterioration of intellect, personality, or habits and patients often remain clean and mostly self-sufficient. Patients also remain oriented well in time and space. Paraphrenia is different from schizophrenia because, while both disorders result in delusions and hallucinations, individuals with schizophrenia exhibit changes and deterioration of personality whereas individuals with paraphrenia maintain a well-preserved personality and affective response. Causes = Neurological  Paraphrenia is often associated with a physical change in the brain, such as a tumor, stroke, ventricular enlargement, or neurodegenerative process. Research that reviewed the relationship between organic brain lesions and the development of delusions suggested that \\"brain lesions which lead to subcortical dysfunction could produce delusions when elaborated by an intact cortex\\".Cummings, J. L. (1985). Organic delusions: Phenomenology, anatomical correlations, and review. British Journal of Psychiatry, 146, 184-197.  Predisposing factors  Many patients who present with paraphrenia have significant auditory or visual loss, are socially isolated with a lack of social contact, do not have a permanent home, are unmarried and without children, and have maladaptive personality traits.Herbert, M. E., & Jacobson, S. (1967). Late paraphrenia. British Journal of Psychiatry, 113, 461.Ravindran, A. V., Yatham, L. N., & Munro, A. (1999). Paraphrenia redefined. Canadian Journal of Psychiatry-Revue Canadienne De Psychiatrie, 44, 133-137. While these factors do not cause paraphrenia, they do make individuals more likely to develop the disorder later in life.  Diagnosis  While the diagnosis of paraphrenia is absent from recent revisions of the DSM and the ICD, many studies have recognized the condition as \\"a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors playing a role in a significant portion of patients.\\" As such, paraphrenia is seen as being distinct from both schizophrenia and progressive dementia in old age. Ravindran (1999) developed a list of criteria for the diagnosis of paraphrenia, which agrees with much of the research done up to the time it was published. : 1. A delusional disorder of at least six months duration characterized by the following: :: a. Preoccupation with one or more semisystematized delusions, often accompanied by auditory hallucinations. :: b. Affect notably well-preserved and appropriate. Ability to maintain rapport with others. :: c. None of ::: i. Intellectual deterioration ::: ii. Visual hallucinations ::: iii. Incoherence ::: iv. Flat or grossly inappropriate affect ::: v. Grossly disorganized behavior at times other than during the acute episode. :: d. Disturbance of behavior understandable in relation to the content of the delusions and hallucinations. :: e. Only partly meets criterion A for schizophrenia. No significant organic brain disorder.  Management  Research suggests that paraphrenics respond well to antipsychotic drug therapy if doctors can successfully achieve sufficient compliance. Herbert found that Stelazine combined with Disipal was an effective treatment. It promoted the discharging of patients and kept discharged patients from being readmitted later. While behavior therapy may help patients reduce their preoccupation with delusions, psychotherapy is not currently of primary value.  Prognosis  Individuals who develop paraphrenia have a life expectancy similar to the normal population.Roth, M., & Kay, D. W. K. (1998). Late paraphrenia: A variant of schizophrenia manifest in late life or an organic clinical syndrome? A review of recent evidence. International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, 13, 775-784 Recovery from the psychotic symptoms seems to be rare, and in most cases paraphrenia results in in-patient status for the remainder of the life of the patient. Patients experience a slow deterioration of cognitive functions and the disorder can lead to dementia in some cases, but this development is no greater than the normal population.  Epidemiology  Studies suggest that the prevalence of paraphrenia in the elderly population is around 2–4%.  Sex differences  While paraphrenia can occur in both men and women, it is more common in women, even after the difference has been adjusted for life expectancies. The ratio of women with paraphrenia to men with paraphrenia is anywhere from 3:1 to 45:2.Almeida, O. P., Howard, R. J., Levy, R., & David, A. S. (1995). Psychotic states arising in late life (late paraphrenia): The role of risk factors. British Journal of Psychiatry, 166, 215-228  Age  It is seen mainly in patients over the age of 60, but has been known to occur in patients in their 40s and 50s.  Personality type and living situation  It is suggested that individuals who develop paraphrenia later in life have premorbid personalities, and can be described as “quarrelsome, religious, suspicious or sensitive, unsociable and cold-hearted.” Many patients were also described as being solitary, eccentric, isolated and difficult individuals; these characteristics were also long-standing rather than introduced by the disorder. Most of the traits recognized prior to the onset of paraphrenia in individuals can be grouped as either paranoid or schizoid. Patients presenting with paraphrenia were most often found to be living by themselves (either single, widowed, or divorced). There have also been reports of low marriage rate among paraphrenics and these individuals also have few or no children (possibly because of this premorbid personality).  Physical factors  The development of paranoia and hallucinations in old age have been related to both auditory and visual impairment, and individuals with paraphrenia often present with one or both of these impairments. Hearing loss in paraphrenics is associated with early age of onset, long duration, and profound auditory loss.  History  The term paraphrenia was originally popularized by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1863 to describe the tendency of certain psychiatric disorders to occur during certain transitional periods in life (describing paraphrenia hebetica as the insanity of the adolescence and paraphrenia senilis as the insanity of the elders.Berrios G E (2003) A Conceptual History of Paraphrenia. Journal of Nutrition, Health and Aging 7: 394-399 The term was also used by Sigmund Freud for a short time starting in 1911 as an alternative to the terms schizophrenia and dementia praecox, which in his estimation did not correctly identify the underlying condition, p. 75-102 Paraphrenie - ein vergessenes Konzept Freuds and by Emil Kraepelin in 1912/3,Kraepelin, Emil. \\"Über paranoide Erkrankungen.\\" Zeitschrift für die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie 11 (1912): 617-638, here 623-626. who changed its meaning to describe paraphrenia as it is understood today, as a small group of individuals that have many of the symptoms of schizophrenia with a lack of deterioration and thought disorder. Kraepelin's study was discredited by Wilhelm Mayer in 1921 when he conducted a follow-up study using Kraepelin's data. His study suggested that there was little to no discrimination between schizophrenia and paraphrenia; given enough time, patients presenting with paraphrenia will merge into the schizophrenic pool. However, Meyer's data are open to various interpretations. In 1952, Roth and Morrissey conducted a large study in which they surveyed the mental hospital admissions of older patients. They characterized patients as having \\"paraphrenic delusions which… occurred in each case in the setting of a well-preserved intellect and personality, were often ‘primary’ in character, and were usually associated with the passivity failings or other volitional disturbances and hallucinations in clear consciousness pathognomonic of schizophrenia\\".Roth, M. & Morrissey, J. D. (1952) Problems in the diagnosis and classification of mental disorders in old age. The Journal of Mental Science, 98, 66–80. In recent medicine, the term paraphrenia has been replaced by the diagnosis of \\"very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis\\" and has also been called \\"atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults\\" by psychotherapists. Current studies, however, recognize the condition as \\"a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors playing a role in a significant portion of patients.\\"  References  External links  * * Canadian Journal of Psychiatry, March 1999, Paraphrenia redefined * Category:Abnormal psychology Category:Psychosis Category:Psychopathology Category:Psychiatric diseases and disorders Category:Psychopathological syndromes ","title":"Paraphrenia"},{"id":"4423887","text":"Ketema Yifru (12 December 1929 – 14 January 1994) was a prominent Ethiopian diplomat and politician.

Early years Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Boland was the daughter of repertory actor William Augustus Boland, and his wife Mary Cecilia Hatton. She had an older sister named Sara.Great Stars of the American Stage, Profile #76, c.1952(reprint 1954) by Daniel Blum The family later moved to Detroit. Boland went to school at the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Detroit. By the age of fifteen she had left school and was performing on stage. In 1901, she began acting on stage with a local stock theater company.  Career  She debuted on Broadway in 1907 in the play The Ranger with Dustin Farnum and had appeared in eleven Broadway productions, notably with John Drew, becoming his \\"leading lady in New York and on the road.\\" She made her silent film debut for Triangle Studios in 1915. She entertained soldiers in France during World War I then returned to America. After appearing in nine movies, she left filmmaking in 1920, returning to the stage and appearing in a number of Broadway productions. She became famous as a comedian. Trailer for The Women (1939) Boland's greatest success on the stage in the 1920s was the comedy The Cradle Snatchers (1925–26), in which she, Edna May Oliver, and Margaret Dale, having been abandoned by their husbands, take on young lovers. Boland's paramour was Humphrey Bogart in one of his first roles. She had previously performed with Bogart in the 1923 comedy Meet the Wife at the Klaw Theatre as Gertrude Lennox. After an eleven-year absence, in 1931 she returned to Hollywood under contract to Paramount Pictures. She achieved far greater film success with her second try, becoming one of the most popular character actresses of the 1930s, always playing major roles in her films and often starring, notably in a series of comedies opposite Charles Ruggles. Boland appeared in numerous films, including Ruggles of Red Gap, The Big Broadcast of 1936, Danger - Love at Work, Nothing but Trouble, and Julia Misbehaves. She is likely best remembered for her portrayals of Countess DeLave in The Women (1939) and Mrs. Bennet in Pride and Prejudice (1940). For the remainder of her career, Boland combined films and, later television productions, with appearances onstage (including starring in the 1935 Cole Porter musical Jubilee), making her last Broadway appearance in 1954 at the age of seventy-two. That play, Lullaby, was not a success. Her last acting was done in the 1955 television adaptation of The Women recreating her film role.  Personal life and death  Boland never married or had children. On June 23, 1965, she died of a heart attack at her home in New York. She was interred in the Great Mausoleum, Sanctuary of Vespers in Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. Boland was a practicing Roman CatholicMorning News, January 10, 1948, Who Was Who in America (Vol. 2) and a Republican who supported the campaign of Dwight Eisenhower during the 1952 presidential electionMotion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 34, Ideal Publishers.

For the 1980s R&B; group of a similar name, see Mazarati. For the Italian car manufacturer, see Maserati. Maserati in 2008, (L-R) Chris McNeal, Jerry Fuchs, Coley Dennis, Matt Cherry (photo by Fred Weaver) Maserati is a band formed in 2000 in Athens, Georgia. Originally conceived as exclusively instrumental, the band's sound later shifted towards psychedelic rock, synth rock and even moments of techno. Their sound is often characterized by soaring guitar hooks and a driving rhythm section interlaced with synthesizers and electronic elements. They are currently signed to Temporary Residence Limited, based in Brooklyn, New York. History Coley Dennis, Matt Cherry, Steve Scarborough and Phil Horan began making music together in January 2000 and in June played their first show at the now-defunct Above Bookstore in Athens, Georgia. That October they recorded and self-released their debut album, 37:29:24. In 2001 the band signed with Kindercore Records and toured the US over the next several years. Their second album The Language of Cities was released in 2002[ Maserati] at Allmusic followed by Confines Of Heat (split with Gainesville, FL's The Mercury Program) in 2003 - both released by Kindercore. Shortly thereafter Athens-based Hello Sir Records released the Towers Were Wires 7\\" and a split CD with Cinemechanica and We Versus the Shark. Cherry left the group temporarily in 2003, replaced by Tristan Wraight. Following a 2004 Japan tour with MONO, Horan left the group and the band went on hiatus for a year. In 2005 the band reconvened with Jerry Fuchs (Turing Machine, The Juan MacLean, !!!) stepping in on drums and Cherry re-joining on guitar. Fuchs' influence pushed the band towards a heavier, more psychedelic and space rock-influenced sound. Maserati toured the US and Europe throughout 2006 and 2007, playing with bands such as !!!, Battles, and Black Moth Super Rainbow. The band signed with Temporary Residence in 2007, releasing their third album Inventions for the New Season later that year followed by the Inventions Remixes 12\\" featuring remixes by Tim Goldsworthy and Justin Van Der Volgen. In 2008 Scarborough left the group and was replaced by bassist Chris McNeal (Some Soviet Station, Vincas). In early 2009 Temporary Residence released the Maserati/Zombi split LP, followed by the rarities collection Passages later that year. Throughout 2008 and 2009 the band wrote and recorded material for a new full-length between various tours supporting both MONO and STS9. On November 8, 2009 Fuchs died suddenly after falling down an elevator shaft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ABC reported that he \\"was trying to jump out of a broken elevator when a piece of his clothing caught on something\\". He was 34 years old. Throughout the following year, Dennis, Cherry and McNeal worked to finish the album they had started recording with Fuchs (his drum tracks were recorded just three months before his death). On November 8, 2010 (exactly a year after Fuchs' death) Temporary Residence released the band's fourth full- length album Pyramid of the Sun along with the limited-run Pyramid of the Moon 12\\" containing an additional dance track as well as a remix by The Field. The band toured the US and Europe throughout 2010 and 2011 with A.E. Paterra filling-in on drums. The band wrote most of the songs on 2012's Maserati VII initially with an Oberheim DMX drum machine but recruited Mike Albanese (Cinemechanica, Shannon Wright, Bit Brigade) to play many of the drum parts in the studio. The album features Steve Moore who both mixed the record and played synthesizers. The band toured Europe in 2013 and Asia in 2014 to support VII's release. The band wrote, recorded and mixed its next album entirely at Albanese's studio in Athens, GA. Rehumanizer was subsequently released in November 2015 followed by a handful of live shows in the US and Europe. In 2016 Dennis moved permanently to Lausanne, Switzerland. Throughout 2017-2019 the band continued to write new material, trading files and demos remotely and occasionally playing together weeks at a time in both the US and in Switzerland. Their next album (recorded in Athens and mixed by John Congleton) will be released in Spring 2020 in tandem with the band's twenty- year anniversary.

By 2008, it had a circulation of 91,665 in the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces of South Africa. Along with Beeld and Volksblad, it is one of three broadsheet dailies in the Media24 stable.  History  On 18 December 1914, sixteen prominent Afrikaners gathered in Stellenbosch to discuss the establishment of a national newspaper. With considerable financial support from local philanthropists Jannie and Christiaan Marais, purchased a quarter of 20,000 ₤1 shares in the new holding company, the project soon got off the ground, with the founding of De Nasionale Pers (\\"the National Press\\") and the selection of Dr. D.

Gass attended Servite High School and was the defensive MVP of the Sunset League, All CIF Southern Section and All State defensive back in 1992. Gass attended Fresno State University and was an all- conference first-team linebacker in 1996 and 1997, leading the conference in tackles in 1996 with 150. Gass went undrafted in the National Football League and, on May 21, 1998, signed with the Eskimos as a free agent. Gass appeared in ten games in the 1998 CFL season, and soon established himself as a key member of the Eskimos' lineup. However, Gass battled a series of career- threatening injuries. In , a ruptured artery in his hand sidelined Gass for 11 weeks. In , 11 games into the season, Gass tore his ACL, MCL, and meniscus and required full reconstructive surgery. He battled back for his starting middle linebacker job in , but in game 15 he tore the same ligaments in his other knee. Once again, Gass battled back again to start the 2003 season with braces on both knees. He went on to win his first championship that season, the 91st Grey Cup with the Eskimos. In , Gass was a key cog in the Eskimos' victory in the 93rd Grey Cup. Gass faced a suspension in after he ripped the helmet off Calgary Stampeders lineman John Comiskey during a scuffle, and threw it to the ground. Gass claimed the situation arose after Jeff Pilon had groped his groin. After appealing to an independent arbitrator, Gass avoided his suspension. Later, during team practice, Gass' teammate Sean Fleming made a prank on him by putting a note and a protective jock strap on Gass' stall. The note read, \\"Sorry for being so frisky. Please accept this gift (the jock strap) as a reminder of my admiration...best of luck with your appeal. Signed: Jeff Pilon, No. 64 (a.k.a. 'Cuddles')\\". Taped to a rung in the locker stall was a jock strap labelled 'The Pilon Protector.' In 131 career games, Gass amassed 440 defensive tackles, 92 special teams tackles, 13 pass knockdowns, 12 quarterback sacks, eight forced fumbles, 22 tackles for losses, 10 fumble returns and three interceptions. He became known for his hard-nosed play and punishing hits on defence and special teams, emerging as a leader and fan favorite at Commonwealth Stadium (referred to as the \\"heart and soul\\" of the Green and Gold defence). On January 31, 2008, Gass announced his retirement as a player and was hired as a defensive assistant on the Edmonton coaching staff. \\"On the field, A.J. Gass played with heart, toughness and intelligence and I believe he'll carry those qualities with him to become a very successful coach,\\" said Head Coach Danny Maciocia. In the summer of 2010 Gass accepted a job and assistant coaching position at Servite High School in Southern California, where he lives with his wife Stacey and their two young children. In 2013, he was named Head Coach of Varsity Football for the Servite Friars in the highly regarded Trinity League of the PAC 5.

From 1970 to 1980, he was lead vocalist for the band Gentle Giant. Career Shulman began his recording career as the singer of British pop band Simon Dupree and the Big Sound, with Pete O'Flaherty, Eric Hine, Tony Ransley, and his brothers Phil Shulman and Ray Shulman. Recording in the late 1960s for Parlophone Records, the band struggled with creative difficulties after experiencing some commercial success with several top 40 hits, including the top 10 hit \\"Kites\\". The band finally dissolved in 1969. The three brothers went on to form progressive rock band Gentle Giant with guitarist Gary Green, keyboardist Kerry Minnear, and drummer Martin Smith (later replaced by Malcolm Mortimore, who was himself replaced by John Weathers). In Gentle Giant, Shulman became known as a dynamic frontman in the live environment and recorded twelve albums with the band over ten years. While the band secured a loyal following of fairly devout fans, they never experienced wide commercial success and, with their popularity waning slightly in the late 1970s, they disbanded after the release of the 1980 album Civilian. Like his band members, Shulman was quite adept on several instruments, including saxophone, recorder, bass, clavichord and their own Shulberry, an electric 3-stringed ukulele.

() (1964 – February 28, 2004) was a prominent commander in the Chechen separatist movement against Russia, in which he played a significant, yet controversial, military and political role in the 1990s and early 2000s. Gelayev was commonly viewed as an abrek and a well-respected, ruthless fighter.Milestones, TIME, Mar. 08, 2004 His operations spread well beyond the borders of Chechnya and even outside the Russian Federation and into Georgia. He was killed while leading a raid into the Russian Republic of Dagestan in 2004. Biography Ruslan Gelayev was born in 1964 in the village of Komsomolskoye (Saadi-Kotar) near Urus-Martan, 10 years after his parents had returned from the Stalinist deportation of Chechens into Central Asia. Gelayev lived for several years outside Chechnya in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, held various jobs and, at one point, served in the Soviet Army. Georgian-Abkhazian conflict In 1992–1993, Gelayev took part in the Georgian–Abkhazian conflict as a volunteer in the Confederation of Mountain Peoples of the Caucasus militia fighting for the Abkhaz separatist side against Georgia, serving under Shamil Basayev. Together with the Chechen Battalion, Gelayev took part in the Battle of Gagra, which marked a turning point in the War in Abkhazia.Vicken Cheterian, War and Peace in the Caucasus: Ethnic Conflict and the New Geopolitics, page 337 After his return to Chechnya, he joined the forces of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria's president, Dzhokhar Dudayev, taking command of the special forces regiment Borz (Борз, \\"Wolf\\" in Chechen) made up of veterans of the Abkhaz conflict. During the subsequent war with Russia, Timur Mutsurayev wrote a song dedicated to the unit, \\"Gelayev's Spetsnaz!\\" (Гелаевский спецназ!), which became popular in Chechnya. In 1993–1994, the unit took part in combat actions against the anti-Dudayev Chechen opposition forces of Ruslan Labazanov and Beslan Gantamirov who were later being aided by Russian covert operations operatives and mercenaries recruited by the Russian secret service FSK from the ranks of the Russian Army. First Chechen War Gelayev fought against the Russian federal forces in the First Chechen War of 1994–1996, notably as a major commander in the 1994-1995 defense of Chechnya's capital Grozny, for which he became one of the first to be awarded the Chechnya's highest medal Kioman Syi (Honor of the Nation). In early 1995, he became the commander of the South- Western Front for the separatist forces, tasked with defense of the Argun Gorge area. The Russians nicknamed him the \\"Black Angel\\" (Чёрный ангел),Dispatches, Chechnya: The Dirty War, Channel 4 documentary, 2006. after his radio communications call sign, \\"Angel\\". Following the fall of Grozny and the Russian push into the highlands, Gelayev personally led the defense of the mountain village of Shatoy, where he was wounded several times. Mumadi Saidayev then took over the command of the front.COLONEL HUSEIN ISKHANOV During this battle, on May 27, 1995, Gelayev announced that if the aerial bombing of the village continued, a number of captive Russian military aviation officers would be killed every day and, according to the Russian human rights group Memorial, eight Russian POWs were executed as Gelayev carried out this threat.Behind Their Backs: Russian forces' use of civilians as hostages and human shields during the Chechnya war (I. Introduction), Memorial, 1997 The later President of Ichkeria (and still later the self- proclaimed leader of the Caucasus Emirate) Dokka Umarov initially served under his command, together with Akhmed Zakayev, before they left it to form their own units. By 1996, Gelayev was seen as one of more radical Chechen commanders.Chechens Drop Russia Talks After Leader's Death, Los Angeles Times, April 25, 1996 On April 16, 1996, Gelayev and the Arab commander Ibn al- Khattab wrecked a large column of Russian armored vehicles in the famous Shatoy ambush, killing scores - or possibly hundreds - of federal soldiers, almost all of them within the first 15 minutes of the attack,Armor Volume 109, Issue 6, page 25 with minimal losses on their own side. Previously, on March 6, 1996, Gelayev had led a surprise raid on Grozny, seizing large parts of the city for two days and inflicting serious losses on federal forces, before leaving with more than 100 civilian hostages.Russia-Chechnya: Chain of Mistakes and Crimes  Armed Conflict in Chechnya: Principal Stages and Important Events, Memorial This was seen as a rehearsal before the recapture of the city in the Battle of Grozny (August 1996), in an operation led by Basayev in which Gelayev also participated, and that ended the war. After the war, Gelayev became a deputy prime minister under the new Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov in April 1997. He went on a Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and took the name Hamzat. The following year, in January 1998, he was appointed the defence minister of Chechnya, a largely honorific post which he held until he was replaced by Magomed Khambiyev in July 1999. Gelayev became the first deputy defense minister in charge of security forces, including personal command of the Sharia Guard. Gelayev, however, maintained links with both Maskhadov and his rivals, in particular with Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and Salman Raduyev. Second Chechen War At the start of the Second Chechen War in late 1999, Gelayev commanded a large force of some 1,500 fighters in the siege of Grozny, charged with defense of the south-western sector of the city. However, he and most of his men left the city without orders in January 2000, which left it open to attack.The Rebel Who Rides to Russia's Rescue, The Moscow Times, 2 October 2002 Following Gelayev's unauthorized withdrawal from Grozny, Maskhadov demoted him from the rank of brigadier general to a private and stripped him of all military decorations. In February–March 2000, Gelayev's forces took heavy losses as they withdrew from Grozny to the mountains of southern Chechnya, where they discovered that their mountain bases had been destroyed by Russian aircraft, leaving them starving, freezing, and low on ammunition. At that point, the notorious Chechen warlord Arbi Barayev contacted Gelayev, promising him aid and transportation to a safe area. When Gelayev's forces arrived at the specified meeting place, where buses were supposed to be waiting to evacuate their wounded,Paul J. Murphy, The Wolves of Islam: Russia and the Faces of Chechen Terror they were ambushed by a large number of Russian troops. They retreated to Gelayev's native village of Komsomolskoye (Saadi-Kotar). There, around a thousand or more rebels were trapped and the village was pounded for weeks by the federal forces in the Battle of Komsomolskoye, one of the bloodiest battles of the war, ending with hundreds of Chechen fighters and civilians dead, along with more than 50 government troops (according to Russian figures). Gelayev escaped, but with only a fraction of his men, and many of demoralized survivors decided to give up the fight.Fatigue Thins Chechen Rebels' Ranks, Los Angeles Times, April 03, 2000 Anna Politkovskaya wrote, \\"How could he ever think of taking the war home, to Komsomolskoe, knowing in advance that his own home village would be destroyed!\\"Anna Politkovskaya, A Dirty War: A Russian Reporter in Chechnya Some time after this crushing defeat at Komsomolskoye, the Russian government attempted to negotiate with Gelayev, since he was believed to be in conflict with the other Chechen commanders (especially with Barayev, against whom Gelayev fought a brief personal war following Barayev's apparent betrayal of him at Komsomolskoye). In November 2000, a Kremlin envoy confirmed that Russian federal authorities were involved in talks with Gelayev, but this information was refuted later.Chronology of events involving Chechen guerrillas , Jane's In 2002, pro-Moscow Chechen government leader Akhmad Kadyrov said to Politkovskaya that he has sent his envoys to negotiate with Gelayev several times.Akhmad Kadyrov: Had I been the dictator of Chechnya « Anna Politkovskaya, Novaya Gazeta, March 22, 2002 In 2003, Gelayev publicly denounced Kadyrov's claims as \\"blatant lies\\" from a \\"despicable traitor\\".Interview with Commander Khamzat Gelayev, Kavkaz Center, 27 October 2003 According to The Independent, Gelayev's alleged secret talks with Kadyrov \\"broke down in early 2001 when Moscow refused to guarantee Gelayev's safety if he laid down his arms\\" and there were also rumours of earlier secret collaboration between Gelayev and the Russians, including the circumstances of his withdrawal from Grozny and his escape from Komsomolskoye.Obituary: Ruslan Gelayev: Feared Chechen rebel-turned-bandit, The Independent, March 4, 2004 (archived article) In 2002, a critical article in The Moscow Times called him \\"the rebel who rides to Russia's rescue\\". In 2001, Gelayev decided to rebuild his forces in the remote Pankisi Gorge across the Georgian border. There, Gelayev had built up a significant armed force from hundreds of Chechen refugees, local Kists (Georgian Chechens), and Ingush and Dagestani volunteers, as well as scores of international mujahideen who had travelled there (mostly Azeris, Turks and Arabs). In August 2001, Gelayev played a crucial role in releasing Russian human rights activist Svetlana Kuzmina, who had been held in Chechen captivity for more than two years. Gelayev acted upon the request of Louisa Islamova, the wife of his friend and rebel commander Lechi Islamov, who was being held in Moscow’s Lefortovo prison pending trial (Islamov died there, allegedly poisoned.He chose martyr's fate, Kavkaz Center ) Islamova had tracked down Vyacheslav Izmailov, a former federal military officer turned a journalist for Novaya Gazeta, and offered to try and persuade the rebels to free hostages if Izamailov would help her try and secure her husband’s release in court. Gelayev wrote a note warning Kuzmina’s captors that if they did not free the woman, they would become his deadly enemies.780 Days in Chechen Captivity, Gazeta.Ru, 2001/08/09 Meanwhile, Georgian authorities were accused of negotiating a deal to supply and arm Gelayev's force in return for Gelayev's leading a raid on behalf of Georgia into the disputed Kodori Gorge in Abkhazia (the October 2001 Kodori crisis). Gelayev earned admiration from senior Georgian politicians, despite the failure of the attempt during which at least 40 people were killed (including five UN observers in a shot down helicopter). Georgian president Eduard Shevardnadze publicly described him as a \\"noble man and an educated person who is well- disposed toward Georgia.\\"Russia, Georgia clash over warlord, The Russia Journal, 2002-09-04 From his bases in Pankisi, Gelayev organised a series of cross-border hit-and-run attacks into Russia. He would not perform any large- scale raid into Chechnya because he wanted to avoid clashes with fellow Chechens serving in pro-Moscow forces and because of his strained relations with Maskhadov and Basayev. However, more than 100 Chechen fighters left his group and returned to Chechnya under the command of Umarov in 2002. Many Dagestani and Kabarday fighters also split from Gelayev and returned to their own republics, Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria, launching the local insurgencies there. In September 2002, Gelayev personally led an incursion into the Russian republic of Ingushetia, capturing the villages of Tarskoye and Galashki, but his fighters became surrounded, took large losses and were dispersed. According to Russia, 30-40 Chechen fighters were killed in shootouts and air attacks and five were captured (though Chechen sources said that seven fighters were killed and five were missing).Russians 'beat off Chechen rebels', BBC News, 26 September 2002Fierce Clash Between Rebels, Russian Troops, Los Angeles Times, September 27, 2002 17 Russian servicemen were also reported killed.46 killed in attacks on Russia government, China Daily, 2004-06-22 Among those killed was Roddy Scott, a British freelance reporter who travelled with the rebels and was allegedly shot by a Russian sniper while attempting to surrender.Briton killed in Chechen rebel skirmish, BBC News, 26 September 2002 Gelayev himself was severely injured and for a time being was out of action. In an October 2002 interview, he said he would \\"continue to fight until not only our country but all the nations of the Caucasus are freed from the double-headed eagle [of Russia].\\"North Caucasus Weekly Volume 3, Issue 28 (October 1, 2002) Death In the winter of 2003–2004, Gelayev led a raid from Georgia into the mountainous Tsuntinsky District region of the Russian republic of Dagestan, during which 20-30 of his fighters (Chechen and Dagestani, possibly including Khozh-Ahmed Noukhayev) and 15 Russian servicemen were reported to have died in the fighting and landslide accidents, while five rebels were captured. According to the official story, Gelayev died on February 28, 2004, following a skirmish with a two-man patrol of the Border Guard Service of Russia that he had encountered while attempting to cross the border into Georgia alone. Gelayev shot and killed both guards (First Sergeant Mukhtar Suleimanov and Sergeant Abdulkhalik Kurbanov, both from Dagestan, who were posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the Russian Federation), but he himself then died soon after as a result of a serious injury he suffered during the shootout, having been hit by a rifle burst in his left arm.To kill Gelayev and die , The Russia Journal, 2004-03-02 After walking about 100 meters, Gelayev cut off his own mangled hand,Chechen Rebels Not Flocking to Syria Experts, RIA Novosti / GlobalSecurity.Org but died from blood loss. However, according to the Kavkaz Center version, Gelayev fought against a larger group of Russian troops and was killed after his arm was shot-off by heavy machine gun fire from a helicopter. In 2013, a retired Spetsnaz GRU Colonel Alexander Musienko claimed that he was aboard a helicopter which killed Gelayev and another Chechen fighter with gunfire and an avalanche caused by rockets already on December 28, 2003, but the corpse of Gelayev was only identified after being dug up from the snow in February 2004. According to Musienko, 20 Chechen fighters were killed and nine were captured and nine Spetsnaz GRU commandos under his command died in this battle, and that the official story of Gelayev's death after the clash with border guards was completely invented. A supposed death of Gelayev in the firefight \\"that left nine Russian soldiers dead in December\\" was actually officially reported at the time, but later refuted and assumed to be incorrect after the new version was announced on March 2, 2004.Europe: Russia: Chechen Rebel Killed, The New York Times, March 02, 2004 The corpse was positively identified by the FSB,FSB Confirms Gelaev's Death , Kommersant, Mar. 02, 2004 but was not released to his relatives because Gelayev was classified as a terrorist by Russian authorities. His family has since been campaigning for the release of his remains or disclosure of what happened to the body, including attempts to buy it back.Russia: A Terrorist In Life Is A Terrorist In Death, RFE/RL, August 23, 2012 Family Gelayev's eldest son, Rustam, was born in 1988 in Omsk, Russia, where his father lived during the 1980s when he was married to a local ethnic Russian woman Larisa Gubkina. After living most of his life outside of Chechnya, in Russia, Rustam moved to Belgium and then to Egypt to study Islam, before allegedly joining the Syrian civil war to fight alongside Syrian rebels (according to the sources sympathetic to the uprising, like Kavkaz Center). Around August 12, 2012, the 24-year-old Rustam Gelayev was reportedly killed by an artillery attack during the Battle of Aleppo. His body was taken to Chechnya, where he was buried on August 17.Son of Chechen Warlord Dies Fighting Assad, The Moscow Times, 22 August 2012Son of late Chechen warlord reported killed in Syria, Chicago Tribune (Reuters), August 23, 2012 Kommersant, however, cited a relative of Gelayev as saying Rustam had been only studying in Syria and was killed on his way to Turkey while fleeing from the war.Military hits town near Damascus, 100 killed in Syria, Reuters, Aug 23, 2012 Ruslan Gelayev later also married a Georgian-Chechen woman named Malika Saidulayeva. From this second marriage he had two sons, Hassan and Hussein, both born in 2003. Several of Gelayev's brothers and sisters were killed during the armed conflict. He has other relatives living in Russia, Georgia and other countries.

It was the third single from the album in the US and Australia. Live versions have an extended intro, an extended middle solo for the saxophone, a guitar and sax duel and a longer outro as compared to the album version. The track was a minor rock radio hit in the US and reached #16 on MTV's Video Countdown in May 1988. \\"The Dogs of War\\" describes politicians orchestrating wars, suggesting the major influence behind war is money. Composition Musically, the song follows a twelve-bar blues structure in C minor, only with significantly different chord changes. A standard blues song in C minor would progress as C minor, F minor, C minor, G (major or minor), F minor, and back to C minor. \\"The Dogs of War\\", instead, progresses in this way: C minor, E flat minor, C minor, A flat seventh, F minor, and back to C minor. All minor chords include the seventh. Singer David Gilmour often approaches the C minor chord by singing on the diminished fifth, G flat, before descending to the fourth, minor third, and root. This melody is also compatible with the next chord, E flat minor, in which G flat is the minor third. It also appears in the A flat seventh chord, as the dominant seventh. The majority of the song is in a slow 12/8 time. After a bluesy guitar solo, the song switches to a fast 4/4 tempo for the saxophone solo. This is not unlike what happens in \\"Money\\", a minor-key blues-based song from The Dark Side of the Moon, in which a saxophone solos over the song's predominant 7/4 tempo before switching to a faster 4/4 tempo for the guitar solo. \\"The Dogs of War\\" also imitates \\"Money\\" in its ending sequence, with a \\"call and response\\" between Gilmour's voice and his guitar.Pink Floyd: A Momentary Lapse of Reason Songbook U.K. Pink Floyd: The Dark Side of the Moon (1973 Pink Floyd Music Publishers Ltd., London, England, [USA ]) Video The video for the track composed of the backdrop film directed by Storm Thorgerson which depicted German Shepherds with yellow eyes running through a war zone plus a live recording and concert footage filmed during the band's three night run at The Omni in Atlanta, Georgia in November 1987 directed by Lawrence Jordan (who has directed concert films for Rush, Mariah Carey and Billy Joel).

The name relates to one of the 12 stones on the Hoshen, the sacred breastplate worn by a Jewish high priest (Exodus 28:20), similar to other nearby towns: Nofekh, Bareket, Leshem and Ahlama (the former name of Beit Arif). Bitan, Hanna: 1948-1998: Fifty Years of 'Hityashvut': Atlas of Names of Settlements in Israel, Jerusalem 1999, Carta, p. 66, (Hebrew) As of , Shoham had a population of . Its jurisdiction is 5,889 dunams (~5.9 km2). History A plan to establish a town in the area that is now Shoham was first proposed in the 1960s, as an idea to establish a town for immigrants from South America. It was again proposed in the 1970s. However, residents of nearby moshavim wanted to build a rural community for the adult children of farmers in cooperative communities. In the early 1990s, Israeli Housing Minister Ariel Sharon put forward a new plan to create a town in the area. Construction began in 1993, when the first 300 homes were built. From then on, the town grew rapidly. By 1995, it had 3,100 residents, and by 2014, had reached a population of 20,000. Character Shoham is a middle-class town, and residency there is considered a status symbol in Israel. In terms of average wages and the rate of high school students who complete their matriculation, Shoham residents rank well above the national average. Its residential areas primarily have single-family homes with yards and duplexes, although there are a few apartment complexes. According to Haaretz, it has a small-town, community-oriented feel, but offers most of the services found in bedroom communities, including shopping centers, a high school, and a middle school. The environment is considered a top priority in Shoham, and each neighborhood has municipal gardens and green spaces. The town's parks and gardens cover over 400 dunams, and are dotted with sculptures. The town has a performing arts center, sports facilities, a public library, and a retiree center and activity club.http://www.shoham.muni.il/?CategoryID=160&ArticleID;=93 Politics Mayors of Shoham: #Dov Shayish, 1993–1998 (appointed) #Shachar Ben Ami, 1998–2003 #Gil Livneh, 2003–2018 #Eitan Patigro, 2018–present Education In the 2009–2010 school year, Shoham ranked top in the country in percentage of high school students passing the Bagrut matriculation exams.

It is a Bildungsroman, or coming-of-age story about the 14-year-old American narrator, Chappie, later dubbed Bone (named for a tattoo that he gets), who, after having dropped out of school, turns to the guidance of a Rastafarian Jamaican migrant worker. Structure The novel is split into two halves: the first concerns his family struggles in America, and the second describes his experiences in Jamaica. Some critics, such as Michiko Kakutani for The New York Times, describe the book as descending from other novels about rebellious teens, such as J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn [New York Times review, May 19, 1995]. The book contains frank descriptions of drug use such as marijuana and methamphetamine and sexual abuse by the narrator's stepfather, which, coupled with the young age of the narrator, has contributed to the book's controversy. Characters Chapman Dorset (a.k.a. Chappie, Bone) is the protagonist of the book. He is a 14-year-old drug dealer living in upstate New York with his mother and his abusive stepfather. He runs away from home to live with his best friend and a biker gang. Bone, although a hardened drug dealer on the outside, is revealed to be quite compassionate, wanting to free an abused girl named Froggy from her captor and to return his mentor I-Man back to his home. In the end he gives up on family. I-Man is Bone's mentor and becomes his closest friend. He is a Rastafarian migrant worker living illegally in upstate New York, in an old school bus that has been emptied and fixed up. He flies home to Jamaica with Bone, where he returns to the drug trade. I-Man is not only Bone's mentor and close friend but he also becomes somewhat of a \\"father figure\\" to Bone, something that he has never been able to find in Ken and Doc. Paul Dorset (a.k.a. Doc) is Bone's estranged father who left his mother when Bone was young and moved to Jamaica. He has a relationship with Evening Star, and stays with her in Starport/the Mothership. Rose (a.k.a. Froggy) is a little girl who was sold by her mother to Buster Brown, a pedophile. She is from Milwaukee. Bone saves her from her captor and she lives for some time in the bus with him and I-man. Eventually he pays to return her to her mother in Milwaukee. Russ is Bone's best friend at the beginning of the narrative. He is a 16-year-old school dropout and stoner. He worked at the Video Den before he was fired for stealing from the cash register. Evening Star is an American heiress/socialite in Jamaica who uses her house to constantly host elite American guests who come down to partake of her parties, which include frequent drug use, reggae music, and what amounts to prostitution with the locals. Her house is called Starport and nicknamed the Mothership by Bone. Buster Brown is a pedophile who bought Froggy from her mother. He is also the manager for a rap group called \\"The Soul Assassins\\". Ken is Mrs. Dorset's husband and Bone's stepfather. He is sexually abusive and an alcoholic. Bruce is the leader of an outlaw motorcycle gang, Adirondack Iron, which is based in Russ's apartment above the Video Den, where Bone stays when he first runs away from home. After the apartment catches on fire, Bruce goes back to save Bone, causing Bone to remember him fondly.  Major themes  Many different reviewers compared Rule of the Bone to other coming of age novels such as Huckleberry Finn and The Catcher in the Rye.  Reception  Rule of the Bone received mixed reviews. In one article, Ed Peaco gave praise to the novel by saying, “Like Huck Finn, Bone’s slyly unsophisticated voice explores big questions like love, sex, crime, sin, race, class, and the fate of children in a fractured society.” Critics admired Banks’ style with one quoting: “...When it inhabits the cooly wised-up consciousness of Chappie, aka “Bone”, it’s harder to get away from than a Big Issue ambush...It features a wandering street urchin whom critics have likened to Huck Finn and Holden Caulfield.” Most praised Banks’ for his likeness to Mark Twain’s infamous tale, Huckleberry Finn, comparing one of the characters in Huck Finn, Jim, to I-man, a middle aged rastafarian who resembles Huck's companion. Others were not as pleased with the structure of Banks' novel. In the book review from The Nation's Jess Mowry states: “...Unfortunately [it's] jumbled together like The Hobbit gets Kidnapped by Peter Pan on Treasure Island.

In the 1840s, he was among the top players in the world.Adriano Chicco, Giorgio Porreca: Dizionario enciclopedico degli scacchi, Mursia, Milano 1971 Life and career He began a military career in Finland, but soon moved to Russia to teach rational mechanics in Petersburg (now Saint Petersburg). He dedicated his life to mathematics and chess, two subjects which he considered closely related. He tried to show their connections in his work Découvertes sur le cavalier (aux échecs), published in Petersburg in 1837. In 1842–43 he published a book on the openings in two volumes: Analyse Nouvelle des ouvertures. In 1862–63 he published his major work: Traité des applications de l'analyse mathématique au jeu des échecs, in three volumes. He wanted to take part in the London 1851 chess tournament, but arrived late and instead played a match with Howard Staunton, which he lost +2–7=1. Three years later he also lost to Ilya Shumov (+3–5=4). Legacy Jaenisch is best remembered for having analysed and helped develop Petrov's Defence with Alexander Petrov, and for his work on the Schliemann–Jaenisch Gambit of the Ruy Lopez, which begins 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 f5!?

Chess engines have worked out a few lines which appear to hold the draw, as in the Benko, but Black's real chances lie in tactical compensation for the sacrificed pawn in a slightly inferior position which requires intricate preparation, where even a minor mistake can often prove fatal for either side.Jaenisch's Chess Preceptor: A New Analysis of the Openings of Games London, 1847 (original in French, 1843), page 29 Staunton was most upset at his death in 1872, writing to Tassilo von Heydebrand und der Lasa in November of that year: > I was sorry to lose Lewis and St. Amant, my dear friends Bolton and Sir T. > Madden, and others of whom we have been deprived, but for Jaenisch I > entertained a particular affection, and his loss was proportionately painful > to me.

Hinds Professor of History of Science, Department of History, and by courtesy the d-school, Stanford University. She received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1984. An international authority on the theory, practice, and history of gender in science, she is currently Director of Gendered Innovations in Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Environment Project. She is an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Schiebinger received honorary doctorates from the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Belgium (2013), from the Faculty of Science, Lund University, Sweden (2017), and from Universitat de València, Spain (2018). She serves on the international advisory board of Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society. Over the past thirty years, Schiebinger has analyzed what she call the three “fixes”: \\"Fix the Numbers of Women\\" focuses on increasing the numbers of women participating in science and engineering; \\"Fix the Institutions\\" promotes gender equality in careers through structural change in research organizations; and \\"Fix the Knowledge\\" or \\"gendered innovations\\" stimulates excellence in science and technology by integrating sex and gender analysis into research. As a result of this work, she was recruited in a national search to direct Stanford University's Clayman Institute for Gender Research, a post she held from 2004-2010. Her job was to promote and support research on women and gender across Stanford University—from engineering, to philosophy, to medicine and business. In 2010 and 2014, she presented the keynote address and wrote the conceptual background paper for the United Nations' Expert Group Meeting on Gender, Science, and Technology. The UN Resolutions of March 2011 call for “gender- based analysis ... in science and technology” and for the integrations of a “gender perspective in science and technology curricula.” In 2013 she presented the Gendered Innovations project at the European Parliament. Gendered Innovations was also presented to the South Korean National Assembly in 2014. In 2015, Schiebinger addressed 600 participants from 40 countries on Gendered Innovations at the Gender Summit 6—Asia Pacific, a meeting devoted to gendered innovations in research. She speaks globally on gendered innovations—from Brazil to Japan, and her work was recently presented in a Palace Symposium for the King and Queen of the Netherlands at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam. Her research interests include current issues on gender and ethnicity in STEM and also early modern Atlantic World history. She was the first women in the field of History to win the prestigious Alexander von Humboldt Research Prize in 1999. Schiebinger's work is highly interdisciplinary. In recognition of her creative work across academic fields of research, she was awarded the Interdisciplinary Leadership Award in the Stanford Medical School in 2010, the Linda Pollin Women's Heart Health Leadership Award from the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles in 2015, the Impact of Gender/Sex on Innovation and Novel Technologies Pioneer Award in 2016, and the American Medical Women's Association President's Recognition Award in 2017. She has held prestigious Fellowships at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin (1999-2000) and at the Stanford Humanities Center (2010-2011 and 2017-2018).  Major works =Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment (2009-) Schiebinger coined the term “gendered innovations” in 2005. In 2009 she launched Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment, a field of research and methodology, at Stanford University. The project was joined by the European Commission in 2011, by the U.S. National Science Foundation in 2012. In 2019-2020, Gendered Innovations received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (2019-2020) to promote and expand methodology and case studies. This project has brought together over 120 natural scientists, engineers, and gender experts in a series of collaborative workshop that drew talent from across the US, Europe, Canada, Asia, and, more recently, South Africa and Latin America. The project served as the intellectual foundations for the “gender dimension in research” requirements in the European Commission's Horizon 2020 funding framework. A Center for Gendered Innovations in Science and Technology Research was founded in Seoul, Republic of Korea, in 2016. Gendered Innovations has developed practical methods of sex and gender analysis for STEM, and provided case studies as examples of how sex and gender leads to discovery and innovations. The project highlights case studies, ranging from stem cell research, to osteoporosis research in men, to inclusive crash test dummies, social robots, machine learning, menstrual cups, nutrigenomics, and assistive technology for the elderly. Of special note is the case study of Google Translate. In 2012, the gendered innovations team discovered that Google Translate defaults to the masculine pronoun because “he said” is more commonly found on the web than “she said.” Although this bias is unconscious, it has serious consequences. Unconscious gender bias from the past amplifies gender inequality in the future. When trained on historical data (as Google Translate is), the system inherits bias (including gender bias). In other words, past bias is perpetuated into the future, even when governments, universities, and companies, such as Google, themselves have implemented policies to foster equality. The goal of Gendered Innovations is to provide methods of analysis to help scientists and engineers can get the research right from the beginning. Schiebinger has also worked to create infrastructure for gender-responsible science across the three pillars of academic infrastructure: funding agencies, peer-reviewed journals, and universities. She advises funding agencies, including the German Science Foundation and the U.S. National Science Foundation, on policies for integrating sex, gender, and diversity analysis into research. She and colleagues published guidelines for editors of medical journals to evaluate sex and gender analysis in manuscripts submitted for publication. She also seeks to help universities integrate social analysis into core natural science and engineering curricula. Finally, she advises industry on develop products that meet the needs of complex and diverse user groups. Has Feminism Changed Science? (1999) Schiebinger's book, Has Feminism Changed Science?, has been split into three sections: 'Women in Science', 'Gender in the Cultures of Science', and 'Gender in the Substance of Science'. Throughout the book, she describes the factors that led to the inequality between male and female in the science field. In addition, she gave examples of different types of women in the society. An important idea brought up in the book was the private versus the public, where the private sphere is seen as the domain of women and public sphere as an area refers for men. Another important point she brought up was that the idea of including women in the fields of science does not mean that the sciences will adopt a more feminist view point. A simple increase in the number of women in a given field does not change the culture of that field. The construction of gender and science is a cycle in that ideas of gender are brought to the table already when practicing science and can inform what evidence people look for or areas they choose to study, and that whatever is found then influences theories of gender. The various contradictions shown through the achievements and silencing of women in science throughout history shows how nature and the society can influence gender and science. Schiebinger not only addresses the gender in the context of science, she also describes the feminism is changed through the history and culture. It is important to note that the book is written from a Western perspective and that the culture she discusses is that of the Western World, and in many cases, more specifically, the United States. The first of the books three sections takes a look at the impacts of some of the first women to be known to have participated in science, such as Christine de Pizan and Marie Curie.3 The section also examines the numerical count of women in the various fields of science in academics in the late 20th century United States, as well as looking at the breakdown of other factors, such as pay rates and the level of degree held, in relation to gender.4 The section goes on to theorize that the cultural reinforcement of gender roles may play a factor as to why there are fewer women in science.5 The second section, 'Gender in the Cultures of Science', argues that science has been gendered as being a masculine field and that women report a distaste for the excessive competition fostered by academic science.6 The argument is also made in this section, that the splitting of gender roles in personal life, where women still take on a majority of domestic responsibilities, may be a reason that is hindering women in scientific fields from accomplishing more.7 The third section of the book, 'Gender in the substance of Science' details the perspectives that women have brought to fields such as medicine, primatology, archeology, biology, and physics. In fact, Schiebinger states that as of the writing of the book, that women earned nearly 80 percent of all Ph.D.'s in primatology, and yet, despite this, having a large number of women scientists in a field does not necessarily lead to a change in the assumptions of science, or the culture of science.8 The Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science (1989) Using a theory coined by François Poullain de la Barre, Schiebinger's prize-winning historical work focuses on eighteenth-century history of science and medicine. The Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science (1989) is one of the first scholarly works to investigate women and gender in the origins of modern Western science. The Mind Has No Sex? exposed the privileged first-born twins of modern science: the myth of the natural body, and the myth of value-neutral knowledge. As Schiebinger demonstrates, the claim of science to objectivity was the linchpin holding together a system that rendered women's exclusion from science invisible, and made this exclusion appear fair and just. She argues that women were ready and willing to take their place in science in the early modern period in astronomy, physics, mathematics, anatomy, and botany. But it was not to be. Schiebinger first identifies these women and the structures of early modern European society that allowed them a place in science. Of note is her work on German women working in guild-like sciences—Maria Sibylla Merian and Maria Margarethe Winkelmann. Schiebinger uncovered the story of Winkelmann, a noted astronomer, and described important paths not taken with respect to women in science in the eighteenth century. Winkemann, for example, applied to be the astronomer of the royal academy of sciences in Berlin when her husband died in 1710. Despite the great philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’s support, she was rejected. With that, the door slammed on women astronomers for the next several centuries. Not only were women, such as Merian and Winkelmann, excluded from modern science but something called “femininity” was also excluded.[10] The best known part of this book is Schiebinger's chapter on “Skeletons in the Closet,” where she tells the story of the first illustrations of female skeletons in European anatomy. Schiebinger argues that it was the attempt to define the position of women (especially white middle- class women) in European society at large and in science in particular that spawned the first representations of the female skeleton. Great debate arose over the particular strengths and weakness of these female skeletons, focusing in particular on depictions of the skull as a measure of intelligence and pelvis as a measure of womanliness. After the 1750s, the anatomy of sex difference provided a kind of bedrock upon which to build natural relations between the sexes. The seemingly superior build of the male body (and mind) was cited to justify his social role. At the same time, the particularities of the female body justified her natural role as wife and mother. Women were not to be men's equals in science and society, but their complements. This internationally acclaimed book has been translated into Japanese, German, Chinese, Portuguese, Spanish, Korean, and Greek. Nature's Body: Gender in the Making of Modern Science (1993) This book, written immediately after The Mind has No Sex?, focuses on how knowledge is gendered. It explores how gender structured important aspects of the content of early modern science, with case studies exploring the sexing of plants, the gender politics of taxonomies and nomenclatures, the gendering of apes, and the agency ascribed to women in shaping racial characters. Her chapter on the “Private Lives of Plants,” focuses on Carl Linnaeus and how his taxonomies contributed to naturalizing the role of “woman” in modern culture. Quaint hyperbole of plants celebrating steamy nuptials on softly perfumed pedaled beds surrounded the discovery of plant sexuality. Plant sexuality was strongly assimilated to heterosexual models of human affections, even though the majority of the flowers are hermaphroditic. Here Schiebinger reveals how Linnaean taxonomy recapitulated social hierarchies by setting the taxon defined by the male stamens above that defined by female pistils. Best known is her chapter “Why Mammals are Called Mammals.” recounting the torrid history of the breast in eighteenth-century Europe. More importantly, this chapter zeroes in on how notions of gender formed scientific taxonomies, and how these taxonomies buttressed gender roles in science and society. By emphasizing how natural it was for females—both human and nonhuman—to suckle their own children, Linnaeus's newly coined Mammalia helped to legitimize the restructuring of European society in an age of cultural upheaval and revolution. This book also contains chapters on the eighteenth-century origins of scientific studies of sex and race, and their relation to questions about who should be included and who excluded from newly emerging scientific institutions. Nature's Body won the 1995 Ludwik Fleck Book Prize from the Society for Social Studies of Science, and her article, “Why Mammals are Called Mammals,” featured on the cover of the American Historical Review, won the 1994 History of Women in Science Prize from the History of Science Society. Plants and Empire: Colonial Bioprospecting in the Atlantic World (2004) Shifting attention from Europe to the Atlantic World, Schiebinger published Plants and Empire in 2004. Developing a new methodology, ”agnotology” (defined as the cultural history of ignorance), she explores the movement, triumph, suppression, and extinction of the diverse knowledges in the course of eighteenth-century encounters between Europeans and the inhabitants of the Caribbean—both indigenous Amerindians and African slaves. While much history of colonial science has focused on how knowledge is made and moved between continents and heterodox traditions, Schiebinger explores instances of the nontransfer of important bodies of knowledge from the New World into Europe. Schiebinger tells the remarkable story of Maria Sibylla Merian, one of the few European women to voyage for science in the eighteenth century.Lost in Translation, Science 14 Jan 2005 In a moving passage in her magnificent 1705 Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium, the German-born naturalist Merian recorded how the Indian and African slave populations in Surinam, then a Dutch colony, used the seeds of a plant she identified as the flos pavonis, literally ‘peacock flower’, as an abortifacient to abort their children so they would not become slaves like themselves. This book reveals how gender relations in Europe and its West Indian colonies influenced what European bioprospectors collected—and failed to collect—as they entered the rich knowledge traditions of the Caribbean. As Schiebinger tells, abortifacients were a body of knowledge that did not circulate freely between the West Indies and Europe. Trade winds of prevailing opinion impeded shiploads of New World abortifacients and knowledge of their use from ever reaching Europe. This book won the prize in Atlantic History from the American Historical Association in 2005, the Alf Andrew Heggoy Book Prize from the French Colonial Historical Society in 2005, and the J. Worth Estes Prize for the History of Pharmacology from the American Association for the History of Medicine in 2005. These prizes demonstrate her ability to win the admiration of scholars across a wide-variety of disciplines.  Secret Cures of Slaves: People, Plants, and Medicine in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World (2017)  From 1932-1972 600 impoverished Alabamian African-American sharecroppers were exploited by the U.S. Public Health Service in its Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972). This book explores the eighteenth-century background of medical experimentation with humans, asking in particular if the large populations of slaves, concentrated on American plantations, were used as human guinea pigs. A major finding of Secret Cures of Slaves is that, in many instances, European physicians in the British and French West Indies did not—as might be expected—use slaves as guinea pigs. Slaves were considered valuable property of powerful plantation owners whom doctors were employed to serve. The master's will prevailed over a doctor's advice, and colonial physicians did not always have a free hand in devising medical experiments to answer scientific questions. Yet, slaves were exploited in eighteenth-century. Schiebinger tells those stories, and also sets these findings firmly in the context of slavery, colonial expansion, the development of drug testing, and medical ethics of the time. It seeks to answer questions about sex and race in medical testing. Specifically, how were human subjects in this period chosen for experiments, and how were notions of uniformity and variability across living organisms developed? Did physicians imagine a natural human body that once tested held universally? Were tests done on white bodies thought to hold for black bodies (and vice versa)? Were male and female bodies considered interchangeable in this regard? These questions are today still key to the mission of protecting and improving human health. Schiebinger also expands our knowledge of African and Amerindian contributions to health and medicine. Europeans, from the sixteenth through to the end of the eighteenth century, tended to value medical knowledge of the peoples they encountered around the world, especially those who were experienced in what we today call tropical medicine. In the Caribbean, Europeans tested many of these medical techniques. Schiebinger explores what was thought of as “slave medicine” (often a fusion of Amerindian and African cures) in the eighteenth-century West Indies in order to gather and evaluate African and American contributions to health and healing. She argues that proper care of slaves as well as soldiers and sailors was a matter of moral concern in this period to be sure, but also a means to secure the wealth of nations. Schiebinger analyzes the circulation of medical knowledge between Africa, Europe, and the Americas, and emphasizes that knowledge created in this period did not respond to science for its own sake, but was fired in the colonial crucible of conquest, slavery, violence, and secrecy.  Personal life  Her partner is Robert N. Proctor, and her children are Geoffrey Schiebinger and Jonathan Proctor. She and her husband distributed their names equally to their two children.

Biography Juggernaut was created in 1985 by former Kamakazi members Scott Womack (bass) and Harlan Glenn (vocals), who were joined by guitarist Robert \\"Bob dog\\" Catlin, formerly with S.A.Slayer. Finding the right drummer proved difficult at first but Catlin's former S.A.Slayer bandmate Dave McClain, later of Sacred Reich and Machine Head, joined the fold just long enough to record the track \\"In The Blood of Virgins\\" for inclusion on Metal Blade Records' Metal Massacre VII compilation in 1986. During that year, the band played many shows, including sold-out shows with King Diamond. After originally being approached by Dave Richards of Azra/Iron Works Records with plans of releasing an EP, the quartet instead signed a deal with Metal Blade Records and they released two studio albums, Baptism Under Fire (1986) and Trouble Within (1987). Both featured guitarist Eddie Katilius who joined the group two weeks before the recording of Baptism Under Fire. Katilius is also the person wearing the World War II-era gas mask on the cover of Baptism Under Fire. Frontman Harlan Glenn, aka Harlan Groom, eventually left the group due to 'musical differences' and moved to Los Angeles, where he fronted a couple of different outfits, including Bon Appetit. His replacement was former Liquid Sky, S.A.Slayer and Narita vocalist Steve Cooper with whom the band recorded the Trouble Within album. Drummer Bobby Jarzombek also ended up leaving in order to join reformed New York City metal outfit Riot, but agreed to record Trouble Within on a session basis. Juggernaut disbanded in 1993 after going through various incarnations in Dallas, Texas, which included Denny Shoup (guitar), Phil Thomas (drums), and John Davis (vocals), with bassist Scott Womack being the only remaining musician from the old San Antonio days. In 1998, Baptism Under Fire was re-issued on CD, including the band's unreleased Iron Works Records EP as bonus tracks, by German-based High Vaultage Records. Singer Steve Cooper succumbed to kidney failure due to complications of type 1 diabetes on May 14, 2006. Notes Harlan Glenn now works as a director, producer, author, archival supervisor, and technical advisor for outlets such as The History Channel and The Discovery Channel specializing in World War II history. He is also a published author of several WWII history books.

Architect Nils Schweitzer, a protégé of Frank Lloyd Wright, designed the structure to complement Wright’s original “Child of the Sun” concept. Construction was completed in 1963. Dedicated to Bishop John Branscomb of the Florida Conference of the United Methodist Church, the auditorium hosted its first performance in 1964. Since that time, the Branscomb Memorial Auditorium stage has presented artists and performing groups from six continents through the college’s annual Festival of Fine Arts series.

These assessments fall somewhere between progress monitoring tools (\\"Tier 1\\") and high-stakes tests.

Manuscript submitted for publication, University of Minnesota. Note. The paper discusses the \\"Standardized Test of Assessment of Reading,\\" which is somewhat incorrect. This meaning is no longer maintained, as the company has created STAR assessments for skills in domains other than reading. STAR Reading, the first STAR assessment, was originally just \\"STAR.\\" Since the creation of STAR Math, the original STAR has been renamed to STAR Reading. Confusion may also arise with California's STAR (Standardized Testing and Reporting) or the Supplementary Tests of Achievement in Reading published by the New Zealand Council for Educational Research, but these are not the same assessments. Purpose The purpose of the STAR assessments is to provide information to teachers about student growth and achievement in grades 1-12. Students take the assessment and it is scored automatically by the software. Teachers and administrators are able to view and print a number of reports at the individual, classroom, and grade level in order to monitor progress. Teachers can then tailor instruction to individuals and to high-stakes testing requirements. STAR assessments Each assessment provides estimates of students' skills and comparisons of students' abilities to national norms. Each is intended to aid with developing curriculum and instruction by providing feedback about student, classroom, and grade level progress. The software reports grade equivalents, percentile ranks, and normal curve equivalents. Each assessment is standardized and highly correlated to other assessments. Thus, the results predict achievement on other standardized tests. For more on the reliability and validity of these assessments, see below. All STAR products were available as stand-alone and network software, but now the company strongly advertises the web-based Renaissance Place version. STAR Reading The purpose of STAR Reading is to assess student reading skills. The assessment provides an approximate measure of each students' reading level. The company claims that students can complete the assessment in less than 10 minutes. STAR Early Literacy The purpose of STAR Early Literacy is to assess students' early literacy skills in preparation for reading. SEL identifies student reading levels (e.g. Emergent Reader) and provides student performance results for pre-K through third grade students. The company claims that students can complete the assessment in less than 10 minutes. STAR Math The purpose of STAR Math is to assess student mathematics skills. The assessment provides an approximate measure of each students' math level. The company claims that students can complete the assessment in less than 12 minutes. Reliability and validity The reliability of an assessment is the extent to which scores from the assessment will remain the same between two administrations within a short period. The validity of an assessment is the extent to which the assessment measures what it claims to measure. A number of other studies have demonstrated the reliability and validity of STAR Reading,STAR Reading Reliability report - PDF file STAR Math,STAR Math Reliability report - PDF file and STAR Early Literacy.STAR Early Literacy Reliability report - PDF file Additionally, a number of studies have demonstrated the correlation between STAR assessments and other tests of similar skills.Research on STAR assessments As with any assessment or test, however, student scores will vary each time the assessment or test is administered. This concept is called the statistical error of a measurement. External agencies, like the National Center on Student Progress Monitoring (NCSPM), have assessed the STAR products and found them to be technically sound.NCSPM chart comparing eight \\"Progress Monitoring Tools\\" Additionally, the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory (SEDL) has categorized STAR Reading and STAR Early Literacy as criterion-referenced and norm-referenced assessments.Comparison chart, published by the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory, listing a variety of reading assessment tests, the grades they are applicable for, and the cognitive elements that they evaluate. In this latter case, the STAR Early Literacy package is said to evaluate eight cognitive elements. STAR Early Literacy was mentioned in the 2006 Readers' Choice Awards: Best Reading Software, a survey by eSchool News. Criticism The Illinois State Board of Education (ISBE) stated in a Summer 2005 letter that it would no longer accept STAR Reading scores for measuring reading \\"performance progress\\" for the Reading Improvement Block Grant.

Official Handbook. Tenth Edition and closed in 1991. History James Shipstone and Sons signage The company produced the Shipstones brand of beer, known locally as Shippos. The company was founded by James Shipstone in 1852 at the Star Brewery in the New Basford area of Nottingham. A red illuminated star at the top of the brewery's tower could be seen for miles around. In 1922, it absorbed both the Beeston Brewery Company and William Hooley Limited. By 1939, the company owned 550 licensed premises, thirty diesel lorries for long distance delivery work and fifty horses for local delivery work. The brewery remained an independent family business until 1978 when the company was purchased by Greenall's of Warrington which also purchased a number of other breweries from neighbouring towns and cities. Greenall's introduced minor changes to the production of the various Shipstones beers and increased the marketing of the company. In 1987, Shipstones became the main shirt sponsor of Nottingham Forest F.C., an arrangement which continued until 1994. A bottle of Iron Brew, produced by Shipstones. In 1990, Greenall's announced that they were ending all beer production and becoming a retailer only company. Production at Shipstones Brewery ended in early 1991 after 139 years. The Shipstones brand continued to be produced for some years afterwards at breweries in Burton upon Trent. Today the company offices have been taken over, while some housing and retail units have been constructed on other parts of the site. The landmark Victorian building, constructed in 1900 with later extension, remains standing and has been earmarked for conversion into offices. In November 2013, a 1921 portrait by Noel Denholm Davis of Sir Thomas Shipstone, of the family who owned the brewery, was auctioned by Biddle and Webb of Birmingham.

They were the officials in charge of the voivodeships (provinces/palatinates) of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The office first appears as Palatine (Palatinus) who held the foremost position after the King. As Poland broke up into separate principalities, each Prince had his court and his own Palatine. When the Kingdom was (in part) consolidated, the Palatines became heads of those former Principalities, which then became Palatinates. As such, the Palatines were members of the King's Council (comites palatini). The title merged with the Polish Voivode or Wojewoda (Slavic Woi-woda/вои-вода (Cyrillic), with two functions, in army or war, and as a “guide” or director, a lexical and institutional equivalent of the Latin Dux Exercituum and Duke, known by the German Herzog, each meaning \\"leader of the army\\"). The difference between Voivode and Duke is that whereas the Duke began as a rank by appointment of the Monarch and later became a hereditary title of honour, the Voivode was appointed for life and maintained real authority as an official—before the Voivodes, too, lost significance to the Starostas. Polish historians, however, use Palatine (Palatyn) and Voivode (Wojewoda) synonymously.  Powers  The powers of voivodes varied, as determined by historical precedent specific to each voivodeship. The least powerful of whom were in Halych Ruthenia (Ruś Halicka), and the most powerful of whom were vassals answerable to the king alone, in Royal Prussia (Prusy Królewskie). Those powers changed over time as well. The office of the voivode was created in the Kingdom of Poland under Piasts, and spread from the Crown of the Polish Kingdom to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania after 1569 where the officeholder became an overseer of his voivodeship, over its administration; however, the effectiveness and real authority of this office declined, so that in the Kingdom of Poland under Jagiellons it was much reduced in significance. In the field of the military, the voivodeship retained only the role of the leader of a pospolite ruszenie. Administrative powers were limited to the role of Marshal of the Sejmik, but even that had disappeared by the time of the Commonwealth. The voivode's control over the cities was mostly honorific, as formally that function was the power of the starost. One of the few powers that voivodes retained throughout history was the power to set and enforce prices (although in fact this duty was delegated to the sub-voivode (podwojewoda)). Voivodes of Cracow, Poznań, Vilnius, Trakai, Sandomierz, and Kalisz (as well as the Castellan of Cracow) held the keys to the Crown Treasury (skarbiec koronny) on Wawel. Voivodes were appointed by the king until 1775, when the power to appoint them devolved to the Permanent Council (Rada Nieustająca). The exceptions to this rule were the voivodes of Połock and Vilnius, who were elected by the szlachta (nobility) from their respective lands (although they still had to be approved by the King). Like all officials in the Commonwealth, only members of the szlachta were eligible to hold an official post. After 1565, the principle of incompatibilitas (\\"incompatibility\\") precluded voivodes and castellans from holding a second title as a minister—except for the post of hetman—as well as the other voivode of starosta grodowy in his own voivodeship. In the Commonwealth, where the nobility forbade the use of foreign honorary hereditary titles, lifetime titles connected with offices were still considered legal to use. Also the wives and children of a dignitary enjoyed their own forms of his title. Therefore, even though the powers of the voivode were relatively small, it was a prestigious position much coveted by the nobles. Thus the palatinal families (rodziny wojewodzinskie) are one of the highest rank among today's Polish aristocracy, next in rank below hereditary Princes. Although many individual voivodes had significant power in the Commonwealth, it was not by virtue of their title, but owing to their wealth and influence, which eventually secured them the prestigious title of the voivode. Thus it is not the title that earned the title.  List  Even when a voivodeship ceased to exist after borders shifted, the office remained intact and the voivode preserved his privileges, such as the right to sit and vote in the Senate. Thus the number of voivodes increased in time, from 32 after the creation of the Commonwealth in 1569 to 37 by the time of its end in 1795. This is a list of the voivodes’ precedence sitting in the Senate of Poland. They took their seats after the bishops, as the first secular officials, although in practice their power was less than that of Ministers of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (who however sat last in the Senate). Note that among them sat three distinguished castellans (wyróznieni kasztelanowie): Castellan of Kraków (who took precedence over all voivodes), Castellan of Vilnius (who sat after the Voivode of Sandomierz) and Castellan of Troki (who sat after the Voivode of Sieradz). There was also one starost (Starost of Żmudź) who sat after the Voivode of Łęczyca.

It is the seat of Szydłowiec Commune (Gmina Szydłowiec). Previously, from 1975 to 1998, it was in the Radom Voivodeship. Szydłowiec historically belongs to Lesser Poland, from its beginnings until 1795, it was part of Lesser Poland's Sandomierz Voivodeship.  History  Szydłowiec in the 18th century; by Zygmunt Vogel. From the 12th century the environs of Szydłowiec belonged to the powerful knightly family of Odrowąż, who were descended from Moravian- Bohemian Baworowic family. In the 13th century the site of the present castle was occupied by a stronghold on an artificial island with wood and earth defences and by a village called Szydłowiec. The present town came into being in the early 15th century and together with the neighbouring estate was the property of the Szydłowiecki and Radziwiłł families until the 19th century. The town flourished in the 16th and the first half of 17th centuries. It was then an important centre of trade and crafts, mainly stone-masonry based on the exploitation of the local sandstone which was easy to work. This stone was used to carve architectural sculptural elements and to make tools for agriculture. It was also a building material for the local Saint Sigsmunt Church, Castle in Szydłowiec and the Town hall in Szydłowiec; moreover, it was sent to Kielce, Cracow and Warsaw. Among the goods traded in were agricultural products. The period of wars 1648–1717 and numerous epidemics and fires brought about a decline of Szydłowiec, which persisted for centuries, its state being yet aggravated after the partitions of Poland. The town owes this present character to transformations in urban design and architecture which took place in the second half of the 19th century and in the 20th century. Szydłowiec also had a strong Jewish community until World War II. At one point it had a population that was of a Jewish majority.

The LANC terminal on Sony and other manufacturers' camcorders lets accessories, such as tripods with a control handle, control the camera over a cable connected to the LANC port instead of using buttons on the camera. It is also available on many still cameras, where it is called ACC (the Sony DSC-xxxx series of cameras). The bi- directional protocol is made up of 8 (8-bit) bytes, usually clocked by the camera at 9600 bit/s. Each frame of bytes occurs in sync with the beginning of each video frame (NTSC or PAL). The physical connector is either a 5-pin mini- DIN connector and jack or a 2.5mm 3-conductor phone jack and plug (TRS connector). In newer Sony digital Handycam(R) camcorders with 10-pin multi-A/V remote terminal jacks, LANC is available, but not directly accessible without making a home-made adapter cable or a pre-made cable by Sony Part# J-6082-535-A. Sony RM-AV2 Remote Commander is an example of a LANC controller that plugs into the Sony 10-pin multi-A/V remote terminal jack. Starting with the 2015 model year, Sony has switched to a special 15 pin multiport connecter that looks similar to a USB connector. However, it has 15 pins inside the connector, where a USB connection has 5. Currently, only the Sony VPR-RM1 controller works with Sony camcorders from 2015 and newer. Sony \\"Control-S\\" is a similar interface, but is uni-directional, providing control-only, and not feedback from the controlled device.

It is owned by Griffin Communications and airs a talk radio format. The station carries CBS News Radio along with local news from its own news department. Weather is provided by sister station KOTV-TV. KFAQ studios and offices are located across from Guthrie Green in Downtown Tulsa, and it transmits from a three-tower facility located along East 11th Street (Route 66) in an undeveloped area of East Tulsa. KFAQ is a clear channel Class A station broadcasting at 50,000 watts, the maximum power for American AM stations. KFAQ uses a non-directional antenna by day, heard over much of Eastern Oklahoma and parts of Kansas, Arkansas and Missouri. It provides secondary coverage as far north as Wichita, as far east as Fayetteville, Arkansas and as far west as the fringes of the Oklahoma City area. Under the right conditions, it can be heard across nearly all of Oklahoma's densely populated area, as well as Springfield, Fort Smith and the outer suburbs of Kansas City. At night, power is fed to all three towers in a directional pattern to protect the other Class A station on 1170 AM, WWVA in Wheeling, West Virginia. Even with this restriction, KFAQ's nighttime signal can be heard over much of the Central United States and well into the Rocky Mountains with a good radio. KFAQ has a local news and interview show on weekday mornings hosted by Pat Campbell. The rest of the day, it carries simulcast news programming from KOTV \\"The News on 6\\" and nationally syndicated talk shows, including Ben Shapiro, Joe Pags, Mark Levin, and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory. Weekends feature shows on money, health, home repair, computers, hunting, fishing and guns. Hosts include Leo Laporte and Gordon Deal. Some weekend hours are paid brokered programming.http://www.1170kfaq.com/shows/lineup History=Station Founding Founded by E. H. Rollestone, KFAQ first signed on the air on June 23, 1926 as KVOO, the \\"Voice Of Oklahoma.\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-171 At the time, the 1,000-watt transmission facility was located in Bristow, Oklahoma. Rollestone, a young oil millionaire, had previously founded another station in Bristow known as KFRU, which had already been sold to Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri. KVOO was moved to Tulsa on September 13, 1927 after being partially purchased by William G. Skelly. Skelly later purchased the entire company on June 28, 1928. In 1933, radio legend Paul Harvey began his radio career at KVOO. Country Music Heritage From the 1970s until May 2002, the station was primarily known for its country music heritage, as well as being nationally famous for Western swing music. KVOO hosted such musicians as Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys, Johnnie Lee Wills and Billy Parker, who has won awards as country music disc jockey of the year. One of the places in Tulsa made famous by KVOO Radio was Cain's Ballroom, located on Main Street. Cain's Ballroom was the performing place for Bob Wills, with live broadcasts on KVOO. In addition, KVOO hosted The John Chick Show, a full hour of local country music talent also seen on ABC-TV network affiliate KTUL Channel 8 until 1979. This program broadcast at 7 a.m., and regularly beat out NBC's Today Show and The CBS Morning News in the local ratings. (This was at a time when ABC had no morning news program). When ABC premiered Good Morning America in 1975, KTUL continued to air the Chick program instead. When Elton Rule, president of ABC, visited KTUL-TV to see why the ABC affiliate was pre-empting Good Morning America, Jimmy C. Leake, owner of KTUL-TV, showed the Tulsa ratings book to Rule, and ABC backed off. KTUL began carrying GMA in 1979, when Chick left the station due to multiple sclerosis. Noted DJs and Performers In 1971, Billy Parker joined KVOO. While at the station, Parker's awards included the Country Music Association Disc Jockey of the Year honor in 1974 and the Academy of Country Music Disc Jockey of the Year awards in 1975, 1977, 1978 and 1984. Parker was inducted into the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame in 1992, the Western Swing Hall of Fame in 1993, and scored the Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters' Lifetime Achievement Award in 1995. The Interstate Road Show was also hosted on the station by veteran country DJ Larry Scott who is also in the Country Music Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. The last live country show was broadcast by veteran Tulsa radio personality Bob O'Shea, who first worked at Big Country AM 1170 KVOO in 1979. He later rejoined KVOO AM in August 1999 and retired from radio June 26, 2006 after more than 34 years in radio. He recorded the entire program including commercials for posterity. The last three songs Mr. O'Shea played were \\"Hello Out There\\" by Billy Parker, \\"T-U-L-S-A, Straight Ahead\\" by Ray Benson & Asleep at the Wheel and \\"Take Me Back To Tulsa\\" by Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys. Switch to Talk At midnight on May 15, 2002 KVOO changed to KFAQ with its current talk radio format. Most of the DJs moved to co-owned 98.5 KVOO-FM and that station added more classic country. In 2003 co- owned KXBL flipped to all-classic country music, playing many of the same songs KVOO AM aired. KXBL calls itself \\"Big Country,\\" the same slogan KVOO AM used when it was at its height. KVOO-TV The NBC television affiliate in Tulsa, KJRH-TV, went on the air as KVOO-TV on December 5, 1954, and both KVOO- TV and Radio shared the same building for many years. In 1970, KVOO sold off KVOO-TV to Scripps-Howard Broadcasting (now the E. W. Scripps Company), and station's call letters became KTEW, In 1980, KTEW became KJRH, which it remains today. Former owner, Journal announced on July 30, 2014 that it would merge with Scripps, with Scripps retaining the two firms' broadcasting properties, including KFAQ. This deal reunited KFAQ with KJRH-TV. On June 26, 2018, Scripps announced that it would sell KFAQ, along with sister stations, Tulsa-based KVOO-FM and KBEZ (92.9 FM), Muskogee-licensed KHTT (106.9 FM) and Henryetta-licensed KXBL-FM (99.5) to Oklahoma City-based Griffin Communications for $12.5 million; the sale would put the stations under the ownership of CBS affiliate KOTV-DT (channel 6) and CW affiliate KQCW-DT (channel 19), both competitors to KJRH. Griffin began operating the stations under a local marketing agreement on July 30, and completed the purchase that October.

It was launched to the public on 30 November 2006, with trials taking place in 1998, 2001 and 2006. Currently, 56% of Ireland's population - mainly in Counties Cork, Limerick and the North East - can receive permanent DAB services. Geographic coverage on a portable or car radio is much less. In contrast, all the RTE stations on the DAB multiplex are also available nationwide via Saorsat and about 99% geographic coverage is possible via DVB. Generic DVB receivers generally need mains, but are typically cheaper than DAB radios. Many portable DAB radio sets have 1/10th to 1/50th of the running time of an AM/FM set, typically giving only 6 hours use. There are also in-dash DVB Terrestrial receivers for cars, though it is illegal for the driver to watch the TV channels. The Digital Radio services all suffer from the low 128 k maximum bit rate. Some channels are lower. One permanent multiplex exists, operated by the national broadcaster RTÉ. The service began to be marketed in May 2007 by a collective of commercial broadcasters, digitalradio.ie; and receivers are now sold by most major electronics retailers. It is proposed to close the RTE DAB service as well as the Digital only RTE radio channels as part of the November 2019 cost saving plan. This proposed closure was set to take place in April 2020 but has reportedly been postponed. A small scale DAB trial was launched last August 2018 in Cork City, Ireland on channel 11A (216.928 MHz). Operated by Viamux Ltd (éirdab). A temporary licensed trial multiplex began transmission using block 9B in April 2010. It was operated by Total Broadcast Consultants Ltd. Initially it covered the Waterford City area and from mid May, expanded to cover much of the South East of Ireland. The trial is no longer operational. A private MUX is also available in the Cork city area on Channel 5A, containing many of the independent stations from Dublin and Cork. DAB Ireland Mux1 (RTE) This multiplex operates on Block 12C (227.360 MHz) from just five transmitters: Three Rock Co. Dublin, Kippure Co. Wicklow, Clermont Carn Co. Louth, Spur Hill Cork, and Woodcock Hill Limerick. Hence the service is only available in parts of Ireland. Its line-up has varied heavily since its launch - initially on 1 January 2006. All stations are provided by RTÉ. It is currently carrying the following stations:DAB Ensembles Worldwide  Ireland * RTÉ Radio 1, 128 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ Radio 1 Extra, 64 kbit/s Mono (part-time service, uses bandwidth from Chill) * RTÉ 2fm, 128 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ lyric fm, 160 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta, 112 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ Gold, 128 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ 2XM, 128 kbit/s Stereo * RTÉ Junior, 128 kbit/s Stereo (07:00-21:00, timeshares a slot with RTÉ Chill).

It was proposed that this multiplex cease operation in April 2020 but this decision has been postponed pending review. DAB Ireland Mux2 (2007-08) No longer operating since November 2008, this multiplex launched in mid-March 2007 and operated from Three Rock Mountain and Clermont Carn on Block 12A (223.936 MHz). It carried ten services - four stations supplied by Communicorp, two by Digital Audio Productions, two by UTV Radio, and two privately held. As of July 2008, it consisted of: * All 80s, 128kbit/s Stereo * Dublin's 98FM, 128 kbit/s Stereo * FM104, 128 kbit/s Stereo * Mocha, 128kbit/s Stereo * Newstalk, 64 kbit/s Mono * TXFM, 128 kbit/s Stereo * Q102, 128 kbit/s Stereo * Radio Kerry, 96 kbit/s Mono * Today FM, 128 kbit/s Stereo * SPIN 1038, 128 kbit/s Stereo * Raidió Rí-Rá Radio stations licensed by the broadcasting commission of Ireland ceased broadcasting on Ireland's second digital radio multiplex (Mux 2) on Sunday, 30 November 2008. The stations were broadcasting on Mux 2 as part of a digital radio trial. RTÉ continues to broadcast on the RTÉ multiplex. ComReg and the BCI are currently exploring regulatory frameworks for digital radio multiplex licensing and broadcast licenses. Cork City 2018/19 DAB Trial (éirdab) A small scale DAB trial launched in August 2018 in Cork City, Ireland on channel 11A (216.928 MHz). It is operated by Viamux Ltd (éirdab), a DAB/DAB+ digital radio solutions company. éirdab has a 1-year test and trial licence from Comreg to perform tests from a site in Cork City. éirdab has invited all local and regional radio stations to join the multiplex.

FreeDAB is an service specifically setup to give more variety to the end user and in turn encourage the transition to the DAB platform. Their multiplexes currently serve Dublin, Cork, Sligo, Waterford and Donegal town and the south east Ireland. In late February 2020 One of the FreeDAB transmitter sites serving Dublin reportedly suffered a raid by ComReg officials and Gardai despite the proposed closure in April of its only legal alternative from RTE.  South-East (TOTAL-DAB) DAB trials (2010-12)  DAB and DAB+ trials were begun in April 2010 in the South- East area of Ireland on channel 9B (204.64 MHz) by Total Broadcast Consultants Ltd, a broadcast engineering company. The company initially obtained a 1-year test and trial license from Comreg to perform tests from sites in Waterford City and a high site in the Blackstairs Mountains, providing coverage in Co. Wexford, Co. Carlow, Co. Kilkenny and East Co. Waterford. In March 2011, a 1-year extension was granted. This was the first DAB multiplex in Ireland to be operated by an independent/private organisation (RTÉ NL operating previous multiplexes), and the first known broadcasts of DAB+ content in Ireland. In addition to all local and regional radio stations, it was carrying several stations previously unavailable in the region.

Biography Pease was a member of the Darlington Pease family, being the son of Joseph Pease and his wife Emma Gurney, daughter of Joseph Gurney of Lakenham Grove, Norwich. His father was a Quaker industrialist and railway pioneer of Darlington, and M.P. for South Durham from 1832 to 1841.

He was President of the Bootham School Old Scholars Association (BOSA) from 1879 until his death in 1903. At the 1865 general election Pease was elected Member of Parliament for South Durham. He held the seat until it was reorganised under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. He was created a baronet of Hutton Lowcross and Pinchinthorpe in 1882, the first Quaker to accept an honour from the state, and in 1894 was offered a peerage by Gladstone, but expressing his indifference left the decision to his eldest son Alfred, who let the matter lapse.Men of Business and Politics.

At the 1885 general election he was elected MP for Barnard Castle. He held the seat until his death in 1903. In his capacity as President of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade, Pease attempted to pass a motion in the House of Commons in 1891 to declare the opium trade \\"morally indefensible\\" and remove Government support for it. The motion failed to pass (despite majority support in the House) due to an amendment calling for compensation to India, but it brought the anti-opium campaign into the public eye and increased opposition to the trade. Towards the end of his life, Pease's businesses had problems and in 1902 the Pease Bank failed. He was forced to sell much of his art collection. He died the following year in Falmouth, Cornwall on his 75th birthday. Family Pease married Mary Fox, daughter of Alfred Fox of the Fox family of Falmouth on 23 August 1854.

Loheed an American writer and director. It was financed primarily with Loheed’s own poker winnings and is believed to be the first independent film financed with poker money. It premiered in 2005 at the Westwood International Film Festival where it won the Best Feature Award. Freeze Out was also an official selection of the 2006 Cinequest Viewer's Voice Festival and the 2006 Omaha film Festival. Synopsis Freeze Out is a comedy about one man's ridiculous and overzealous attempt to get revenge for the constant ribbing of his best friends at his weekly poker game. John's weekly poker game is a sanctuary from the horrors of living and working in Los Angeles: a ritual of jokes, beer drinking, talking movies, politics, and sex. In short, it's a good time and the max bet is 25 cents so no one is going to go broke. But something is bugging John. His friends don't respect him; any chance they get they cut him down, tell him he's boring, make him feel small. He's tired of being the butt of their jokes and he's not going to take it anymore. So he raises the stakes, trains in secret and engineers a winner-take-all Freeze Out, never realizing it might cost him his 7 best friends. What starts as an innocent night of low stakes poker becomes a ripping lampoon of friendship and a funny look at how we all lie to ourselves.

Fisherton is primarily an upper middle-class, residential neighborhood. It features two social clubs, the Club Fisherton and the Jockey Club, the latter being of national importance in the sports fields of rugby, hockey and golf. The barrio was started in the 1880s. The planning was conducted by famous architect Alejandro Bustillo. It was a small village designed to accommodate the personnel of the British companies that were investing in the nascent Argentine railway system at the time, and was absorbed into the city later. This past is preserved by the former Antártida Argentina railway station, which was turned into an exhibition hall, and by several old English-style mansions. References * Clarín, 30 March 2003.

He was probably best known for his role as Colonel Kurt Von Strohm in the British sitcom Allo 'Allo!. Biography=Early life Born in Petrograd, Russia, Molchanov (nicknamed \\"Sasha\\" by his family) was the eldest son of Colonel Pavel Molchanov, of the Semyonovsky Regiment, one of two that were set up for children of children who had played with Peter the Great of Russia. In 1924, his entire family left the Soviet Union and went to Finland and then Germany, before ending up in Britain and London, where Alexander's grandmother, Olga Novikov (known in the family as \\"Babushka London\\") lived in Harley Street. After being educated at Monmouth School in Wales, Molchanov became an assistant to the Russian tenor Vladimir Rosing, where he performed at Covent Garden. During World War II he joined the RAF, and was posted to South Africa with the Air Training Corps. After being invalided out, he changed his name to Richard Marner and began his long successful career as a stage and film actor. Career One of Marner's early stage roles – as Dracula, with Howard Dean – is still regarded by some as the definitive interpretation of the role. In 1967, well before his role as the German Colonel in 'Allo 'Allo Marner played the minor and uncredited role of a German sentry in the classic war film The Dirty Dozen. His other films include Ice Cold in Alex, The One That Got Away, The Password Is Courage, You Only Live Twice, The Boys from Brazil, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, The African Queen and the Swiss film Four in a Jeep, in which he did all the Russian dialogue. He was also in the television movie Birth of the Beatles, as Bruno Koschmider. Marner's best known role was in 'Allo 'Allo! as German Commandant Colonel Kurt Von Strohm. He appeared in all nine series of the programme between 1984 and 1992. He also appears in an episode of Secret Army, the programme that 'Allo 'Allo parodies. His other work included roles in Mackenzie (1980), Triangle (1981), Lovejoy (1994), and the film The Sum of All Fears (as the Russian president). In 1991, when the President of Russia Boris Yeltsin, convened a \\"Congress of Compatriots\\" (an olive branch to some of the post-1917 White Russian diaspora), Marner was one of the 600 people who returned to the motherland. Despite being caught up in a coup, he stayed long enough to watch, through tearful eyes, the raising of the first Imperial Russian flag flown in Moscow since 1917. Personal life He died 9 days before his 83rd birthday on 18 March, 2004, in Perth, Scotland and left a wife, actress Pauline Farr, who retained Molchanoff as her off-stage name. Marner was fluent in Russian, English, French and German. He is survived by a daughter and three grandchildren.

It has produced over 100 events annually, which included fashion shows, film premieres and screenings, live music and art receptions and tours. Gen Art's offices are located in New York City and Los Angeles and since 2014, the company has been headed up by Keri Ingvarsson and a small team of private investors. Previous offices have included San Francisco, Miami and Chicago. On February 21, 2011, Gen Art announced it would return with the 16th Annual Gen Art Film Festival in New York City.The Hollywood Reporter (retrieved 27 February 2011) Gen Art has since then announced its \\"Fresh Faces in Fashion Show\\" during New York Fashion Week 2011, which will feature the designers Ann Yee, ace & jig, Sunghee Bang, Eighteenth, Jennifer Chun, William Okopo, Baron Wells, Collina Strada, Falconiere, Osborn, and Wool and the Gang. History Gen Art began as a non-profit company, called Generational Arts Limited, by Ian Gerard, Stefan Gerard and Melissa Neumann in 1993. At the same time a for-profit production arm of Gen Art, Generational Art Productions was also launched. Ian was attending New York University Law School at the time. Ian knew that many emerging visual artists from his college experience (Vassar) and elsewhere had difficulty showcasing their talents in the art galleries of New York City. He also noticed that there were a lot of young people with disposable income, who wanted to obtain art but could not afford to buy from the SoHo art galleries. The idea was to bring together these two groups together so they could both benefit. Gen Art was launched from Ian's law school dorm room at New York University, using just a fax machine and a laptop. Ian's brother Stefan, who worked in publishing, and Melissa Neumann, a 23-year-old analyst at Lehman Brothers, joined the organization. Early on an advisory board of artists, gallery owners and dealers was formed to help establish some credibility within the art community. Then a fundraiser showcasing four emerging artists was organised. This was a success, with 500 people attending and a write up in the New York Times styles section. The company expanded into fashion in 1995, on the advice of a young accessories designer who had attended one of the art exhibitions. A one night fashion show for emerging fashion designers was held using excess gallery space. A year later Gen Art hired a young film professional, Paul Gachot, to create and direct its first film festival. Around this time Gen Art began to expand, opening an office in Los Angeles in the summer of 1995 and San Francisco in 1996. Upon graduation in late 1994 Ian started work at a corporate law firm. Stefan became the day to day CEO of the Company. Stefan quit the company in 1997 and Ian left his law job to work full-time at Gen Art, becoming the CEO. In 1998 Adam Walden was brought in and made the company president. In the beginning of 2002 when a group of venture capitalists offered to invest in Gen Art, the bulk of the business was moved from the non-profit to the for-profit entity which then took over all responsibilities for corporate sponsorship and production of Gen Art's programming. Gen Art was able to leverage new national partnerships with Heineken and Chrysler to take the company national and Gen Art launched new offices in Miami and Chicago, and centralized the West Coast office oversight in New York. From 2002 - 2009, Gen Art produced over 100 events in fashion, film, music and art showcasing over 1,000 emerging talent. Its Film Festival celebrated its 18th Anniversary in October 2013. In February 2011, Gen Art announced was acquired by publishing company Sandow Media.The Hollywood Reporter (retrieved 27 February 2011) Under this new umbrella, longtime Gen Art Senior Executives Elizabeth Shaffer and Jeffrey Abramson were named Co- Presidents. As of 2016, Gen Art is currently owned and operated by fashion executive Keri Ingvarsson and a team of private investors. Today, Gen Art is a leading arts and entertainment company dedicated to showcasing emerging fashion designers, filmmakers, musicians and visual artists. Gen Art produces high-profile events, ranging from an authentic film festival to massive star- studded fashion shows, live music performances, art exhibitions, multimedia events and much more. Over the years Gen Art has helped launch the careers of many influential designers, filmmakers, musicians and artists: Zac Posen, Rodarte, Jennifer Lawrence, Rooney Mara, Rebecca Taylor, Vena Cava, Mandy Moore, Adrian Grenier and Jason Reitman are just a few names on our roster. Gen Art's programs offer creative conception, innovative design, eloquent brand activations, avant-garde content development, competitions and media exposure, all the while staying true to emerging talent.

The 77th Regiment was one of the first three Highland Regiments to fight in North America.The Highland regiments that landed in America and took part in the French and Indian War were the 42nd Regiment of Foot or Royal Highland Regiment (\\"The Black Watch\\"), the 77th Regiment of Foot and the 78th Regiment of Foot. During the Seven Years' War, the regiment lost 110 soldiers and 259 were wounded. History The regiment was raised at Stirling by Major Archibald Montgomerie as the 1st Highland Battalion and ranked as the 62nd Regiment of Foot in 1757. Formed under a plan to increase the loyalty of the Highlanders to the Crown by sending 2,000 Highlanders to fight in North America, the battalion ultimately included thirteen companies with 105 enlisted men each for a total of 1,460 men with 65 sergeants and 30 pipers and drummers. The battalion was drawn from the Montgomery, Stuart, Fraser, MacDonald, Cameron, Maclean, and MacPherson clans. Montgomerie recruited the first ten companies in 1756 and an additional three in 1757. The first ten companies departed Cork on 30 June 1757 to reinforce the garrison of Charleston, arriving there on 3 September. At Charleston, 200 soldiers who were from the Scottish Lowlands were transferred to the Royal Americans. The three new companies, meanwhile, were sent to Philadelphia and arrived there on 22 April 1758, moving to Carlisle in May. The rest of the battalion was transported to Philadelphia and debarked there on 8 June. The battalion was renamed the 77th Regiment of Foot (Montgomery's Highlanders) in June 1758. The regiment participated in the capture of Fort Duquesne in November 1758. In 1760, six companies participated in a campaign against the Cherokee under the command of the regiment's colonel. It sailed for the West Indies in June 1761 and took part in the Invasion of Martinique in January 1762 and the Battle of Havana in June 1762. It went on to New York City in October 1762 and saw action at the Battle of Bushy Run in August 1763 after which it was disbanded later in the year.

Students, staff, and alumni of Loyola, Jamshedpur, are known as Loyoleans. The institution was established in 1947 by the Jesuit missionaries from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, belonging to the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic religious order founded by St. Ignatius Loyola in 1540. The school had previously been a boys school with the exception of girls studying only in standards 11 and 12, but in 2001 turned co-educational. Loyola School, Jamshedpur, consistently ranks among the best schools in India. The school crest The \\"chakra\\" or wheel on the left-hand corner is found in the center of India's Tri-colour and stands for progress.

The symbol in the bottom left corner is a ladle from Tata Steel's blast furnace in Jamshedpur and signifies that the school is located in India's Steel City. The symbol in the right-hand corner of two wolves drinking out of a cauldron is taken from the coat of arms to be found in the Castle of Loyola, Spain, the birthplace of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit Society. The Latin motto \\"IN CARITATE ET JUSTITIA\\" appearing on the ribbon underlining the base of the crest translates to \\"In charity and justice\\".

It was started due to the interest shown by the students of XII Commerce 1993 batch who were supported by the then principal Father Eric Cassel and Mrs Leela Ghose, and is the successor to an earlier newspaper called \\"Jai Loyola\\" which was discontinued in the 80's. One of the only student-published magazines in East India, it frequently deals with matters of importance for teenagers and students in general. The magazine is edited, illustrated, designed and typeset solely by the members of the Loyola Press Club with the support of its moderator, and consists mostly of contributions from students, teachers, and alumni, along with regular reports and articles by members of the LPC. Most of its content is in English, although a few pages of Hindi articles are also present. In 2011, a digitally illustrated comic strip was added to the magazine. This trend has continued ever since this issue. A special annual edition of the Loyolean was introduced instead of the bi-annual editions. This issue also saw the introduction of a section-wise arrangement of the magazine and 8 coloured pages to give it a more appealing identity. The Editors also did away with the previous system and also brought on board the students of Standard 10.

Richard De Gylpin determined to free them from these attacks, and tracked the monster through the forest. After a dramatic fight he slew the animal on the spot of the Wild Boar Inn, on the banks of the little stream, ever since known as the Gilpin. After these brave exploits Richard de Gilpin changed his family crest to include a black boar on a gold background. He was rewarded with the lordship of the manor of Kentmere by the Baron of Kendal for his exploits. The event was immortalised in a song known as the Minstrels of Winandermere (see Gilpin family history for lyrics). George Carleton, Bishop of Chichester (1619–28), wrote a life of Richard's descendant the famous Bernard Gilpin, in it he said that Richard “slew a wild boar raging in the neighbouring mountains like the boar of Erymanthus, brought great damage upon the country people, and was as a reward for his services given the manor of Kentmere by the then Baron of Kendal.” References Category:Cumbrian folklore ","title":"Wild Boar of Westmorland"},{"id":"4424465","text":"Daniel Gonzalez (21 June 1980 – 9 August 2007), also known as the Freddy Krueger Killer and the Mummy's Boy Killer, was a British spree killer who murdered four people and injured two others during two days across London and Sussex in September 2004. Gonzalez was inspired by horror films such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th to become a \\"famous serial killer\\". He went on a drug-fuelled stabbing spree, attacking the elderly and infirm, writing about his experiences in letters to himself as \\"Zippy\\", his past nickname. His letters said how much he enjoyed the murders \\"...one of the best things I've done in my life\\", and how similar he was to the character Freddy Krueger. Gonzalez's mother had previously written a letter to her MP criticising that a serious incident had to occur before he could receive mental help. In her letter, she rhetorically asked \\"...does my son have to commit murder to get help?\\" He was jailed for life in 2006 and committed suicide in a psychiatric hospital the following year. Early life Daniel Gonzalez, who had an English mother and Spanish father, was educated at Gordons School, a privately run school in West end, Woking. His parents separated in 1986 when he was six years old. Gonzalez left school with eight GCSEs and was known to be a good actor, a chess champion, but also a \\"dark and troubled boy.\\" From the age of 17, Gonzalez received care because of his psychological problems and was treated by specialist mental health teams. By the age of 24, he was unemployed and using drugs. He spent all his time playing computer games and watching horror films. Victims On 15 September 2004, Gonzalez told 61-year-old Peter King, who was walking his dog with his wife in Hilsea, Portsmouth, that he was going to kill him. He was fought off and fled to Hove, where he stabbed 76-year-old Marie Harding while wearing a hockey mask, similar to the character Jason Voorhees. When the mask was taken in for evidence, it had Harding's DNA on it. After killing Harding, he returned to his home in Woking. He concluded that the reason for his failure to kill King was because his knife was too small. Two days later, on 17 September 2004, Gonzalez travelled to Tottenham. At 5:30 am he left 46-year- old Kevin Molloy for dead after stabbing him in the face, neck and torso with a pair of large knives he had stolen from a department store. At 7:00 am he made a forced entry into the Hornsey house of Koumis Constantino, but was fought off after stabbing his arm. By 8:00 am he was in Highgate, where he randomly tried to gain access to houses. He murdered an elderly couple, Derek and Jean Robinson,Is there a cure for Britain's most dangerous criminals? an experience he claimed was \\"orgasmic\\". Arrest and trial Gonzalez was arrested at 12:00 pm on 17 September 2004 at Tottenham Court Road Underground station after a decorator, who had seen him running naked and covered in blood from the Robinsons' house, reported him to the police. Whilst awaiting trial at Broadmoor Hospital, Berkshire, Gonzalez tried to bite himself to death and was viewed as being so dangerous that officers would accompany him in riot gear. At the trial, Gonzalez tried to claim that he was not guilty by reason of insanity, although this was rejected. He was given six life sentences, with the trial judge recommending that he should never be released. Death After his arrest, Gonzalez attempted to kill himself by biting through an artery in his arm. 'I have never seen anyone bite himself with that ferocity,' said the inspecting doctor. He survived but committed suicide in his cell in Broadmoor Hospital, on 9 August 2007 by cutting himself with the edges of a broken CD case in his prison cell.

Not all the American voice artists are known for the first two seasons (owing to their non-union status they were not credited in the shows' closing titles), and a different group of actors provided voices in the third season.  Yamato Crew = First season  * Captain ' (Captain Abraham Avatar'): The stern captain of the Yamato, utterly devoted to his mission to save Earth from the Gamillas threat, even at the cost of his own life. He is in fact dying, and becomes increasingly ill during the course of the first season, but remains convinced that he will live to see his home world again. He regards Susumu Kodai almost as a replacement for the son he lost in battle, and sorely regrets his son's death in battle at Pluto, along with the apparent death of Kodai's older brother, Mamoru. Even when his illness leaves him bedridden, he remains a source of advice to the crew, and to Kodai in particular. In the movie Final Yamato, it is revealed that he was kept in cryogenic suspension for some time until the Earth physicians could revive him and cure his sickness. He then went on to lead the Star Force again in its fight against the Deingillians. In the English edition, it was revealed that he was revived from death by residual energy from the Cosmo DNA's cleansing of Earth, but was bereft of nearly all of his memories as a result. He was kept in hiding by Doctor Sane until later in the series. In Final Yamato it became partially true, as he was shown to be held into a cryogenic sleep to be cured from his otherwise fatal disease. : In Space Battleship Yamato 2199 Admiral Okita is revealed to have been a senior naval commander for some time having led a United Nations fleet in a war with human colonists of Mars before headquarters got him suspended from his command after he refused an order to fire upon the Garmilans at their first encounter at Pluto, and ordered forward commander Commander Daigo Shima instead to do it. This results in the Garmilans fighting until near Mars, where Okita engineers a costly victory which included the death of his son who was also a naval officer. Garmilas pulls back to their base on Pluto and intensify their bombardment of Earth with irradiated asteroids. Okita leads an assault on the Pluto base, where his fleet was decimated by a far superior force, but managed to distract the Garmilans from noticing the arrival of a ship from the distant planet of Iscandar piloted by Princess Sasha, who perished while delivering the warp core that powered up Okita's new battleship, the Yamato. Okita is known for his aggressive head-on tactics, and it saw the Yamato through several battles. He also uses terrain with his ferocity to his advantage, frequently upsetting opponents with unexpected tactics. He would also be diplomatic when called for, making alliances more than once with Garmilans when necessary. He formed a bond with Susumu Kodai, reminding him strongly of his elder brother Mamoru whom he had mentored. He encouraged Kodai to think independently, giving Kodai the confidence to disobey orders. During the course of the series he had to contend with his illness, which caused him to collapse a few times, one of which required emergency surgery while battling the dimensional submarine at a protoplanet; but he even overrode the objections of his friend and immediate superior Admiral Hijikata before the voyage, just to be on it. He led the ship all the way to the Garmilan homeworld (revealed to be Iscandar's twin planet), smashing their way to the heart of the empire at Desler's palace. Okita then chose to use the Wave Motion Gun to save the people of the Garmilan capital Baleras when Desler attempted to sacrifice it just to destroy the Yamato. Okita was unable to leave the ship upon arriving at Iscandar, and became increasingly bedridden on the return journey, even during their encounter with the Celestial Ark and a Gatlantean expeditionary force and a final confrontation with Desler within the warp gate dimension. Okita died as the Yamato came into Earth orbit having achieved his mission and seeing his home planet again, his spirit being captured by the Cosmo Reverse System, left vacant by Mamoru Kodai's spirit when he prematurely activated the system. Thus it was Okita's spirit and memories that directed the Cosmo Reverse System's restoration of Earth to a healthy world. :* Japanese voice artist: Gorō Naya (original), Takayuki Sugō (2199) :* American voice artist: Gordon Ramsey (original), Brian Mathis (2199) :* Live-action actor: Tsutomu Yamazaki * ' (Derek Wildstar, also known as Jason Kodai in the English dub of the first Yamato movie): A young orphan, it was the death of his parents during a Gamillas planet bomb attack on the Miura Peninsula that drove him to follow in his older brother Mamoru's footsteps and join the Earth Defense Force. He is initially hot-headed and prone to bursts of anger, and at first blames Captain Okita for the death of his brother in battle. However, he matures during the first season thanks to his responsibility as the Yamato 's battle chief, and ultimately Okita nominates him acting captain when he is unable to continue. Kodai continues commanding the Yamato and its crew for most of the rest of the franchise (although he is not formally promoted to captain until Yamato III), only relinquishing command twice: to Yamanami in Be Forever Yamato, and to a revived Okita during Final Yamato. He is also a talented pilot, flying his own Cosmo Zero fighter as the leader of the Black Tigers, and in the second season frequently joining the Cosmo Tigers in battle. His Japanese given name means \\"to go forward, to improve\\". He remains the lead character throughout the original timeline serving as the Yamato's commander until Final Yamato when a revived Okita retakes command. He retires from the military afterwards, joining the merchant fleet raising a daughter with Yuki Mori although the relationships become estranged as he spend more time away from Earth. Sanada recalls Kodai to command a rebuilt Yamato in Resurrection after Mori's ship goes missing. In the 2010 live-action film, his story begins as a scavenger who left the Earth Defense Force five years prior. He blamed himself for redirecting a Garmilas bomb toward a space station, killing his parents and Daisuke Shima's wife. He re-enlists prior to the launching of the Yamato as the ship's gunner before eventually being promoted by Okita as acting captain. Though the Yamato succeeds in retrieving the means to restore Earth's surface, the remaining Garmilas ship cripples it before preparing a missile to destroy the planet. After ordering all surviving crew to abandon ship, Kodai sacrifices himself and the ship to destroy the missile and save Earth. : In the 2199 series Kodai is depicted as a young, freshly graduated cadet officer and is promoted suddenly to command the tactical division of the Yamato when most of the junior officers are killed by Garmilas aircraft bombs immediately prior to boarding the Yamato. He matures quickly as one of the bridge crew on the Yamato and is the first to fire the Wave Motion Gun. After an initial confrontation with Okita over his brother's death, he forms a bond with him, who was his brother Mamoru's former mentor. Okita encourages Kodai's independent streak and he takes on Okita's aggressive tendencies in battle tactics, most notably disobeying Sanada's orders and developing anti-submarine tactics during their first confrontation with the Garmilan dimensional submarine. He and Operations Officer Yuki Mori become romantic partners over the course of the series and become engaged before the start of the 2202: Warriors of Love series. After the Yamato crew are summoned to Telezart by Teresa, Kodai gather the crew to rebel against the Cosmo Navy and steal the Yamato from dry dock where the ship had been rebuilt. Sanada gives Kodai command of the Yamato, noting that Kodai is a leader where he is not. Kodai struggles with command as he is still in his mid-twenties and placed under great strain which is only relieved when Admiral Hijikata accepts Kodai's offer of command as the ship approaches Telezart. :* Japanese voice artist: Kei Tomiyama, Kōichi Yamadera (PlayStation 2 games, Rebirth), Daisuke Ono (2199) :* American voice artist: Kenneth Meseroll (seasons 1 & 2), John Bellucci (season 3), Christopher Wehkamp (2199) :* Live-action actor: Takuya Kimura * ' ('Alex Wildstar, also known as Alex Kodai in the English dub of the first Yamato movie): The older Kodai/Wildstar brother and captain of Missile Ship 17, the Yukikaze (Paladin in Star Blazers), Mamoru appears to die in the first episode while holding off enemies so Okita's stricken flagship may escape the battlefield. In the original, Mamoru was insisting he could not face the souls of his dead comrades if he fled whereas in Star Blazers he dies for the sole purpose of providing cover for Okita's ship. In fact, it emerged his ship had crash-landed—in one piece—on Titan, and he had been captured alive by the Garmilans, but the ship in which he was a prisoner crashed on Iscandar, where Queen Starsha healed him. He fell in love with his rescuer and decided to stay on Iscandar, fathering a daughter named Sasha. His Japanese given name means \\"to protect\\". He sacrificed his life in Be Forever, Yamato in order to save Admiral Heikuro Todo from execution. The character of Mamoru Kodai was originally planned to have appeared midway through the series as a scarred space pirate under the guise of Captain Harlock. When the series' episode count was cut, these plans had to be scrapped and his storyline was quickly wrapped up with his appearance on Iscandar. However, this space pirate angle still remains in Leiji Matsumoto's Space Battleship Yamato manga. : In 2199 Kodai is best friends with Shiro Sanada in college and is in a relationship with Sanada's research partner Kaoru Niimi in the early stages of the war. By 2199 Mamoru Kodai has risen to rank of Lieutenant Commander and captains the missile destroyer Yukikaze when as the only other ship surviving the battle of Pluto he sacrifices himself and his ship to cover the retreat of the Kirishima, Earth's last battleship. He survives the ship's crash into the Saturnian moon Enceladus and is captured by Garmilan forces and sent as a biological sample of Earth to the homeworld when the destroyer crashes at Iscandar. Queen Starsha hides him from the Garmilans who recover the wrecked warship. He lives on for a few months with Starsha developing a close friendship while being the only two people on the planet but eventually succumbs to his wounds, leaving behind a message for the Earth ship approaching Iscandar and his brother Susumu. Starsha recovers Mamoru's spirit within the Cosmo Reverse Device which will restore the Earth. Mamoru, watching his brother's grief over the death of Yuki Mori and sensing Captain Okita's death, charges the Cosmo Reverse Device and revives Mori, leaving the Device dead until it captures Okita's departing spirit, re-initialising the system for use in restoring Earth. :* Japanese voice artist: Taichirō Hirokawa (Original), Mitsuru Miyamoto (2199) :* American voice artist: Z Charles Bolton (2199) :* Live-action actor: Shinichi Tsutsumi * ' (Nova Forrester): Initially Dr. Sado's nurse, Yuki gained the additional responsibilities aboard Yamato such as operating the radar, performing computer calculations, taking care of the crew's morale and, along with Kaoru Niimi, searching planets for food sources. She is from the outset attracted to Susumu, but conceals her true feelings with girlish glee. As the only significant female crew member, she was occasionally the subject of fan service in the form of skirt-flippings by Analyzer, though only in early episodes before the tone of the series becomes generally more serious. Her Japanese name means \\"forest snow\\", creator Matsumoto being fond of female characters with \\"Yuki\\" (snow) as part of their name. She serves faithfully aboard the Yamato throughout the series run and finally is married to Susumu Kodai at the conclusion of Final Yamato. She and Kodai raise a daughter Miyuki who becomes a vet nurse working with Dr. Sado. Mori rises to the rank of Captain and is commander of a vessel supporting the Earth Federation battleship Blue Noah when the ship goes missing at the start of Resurrection. It is implied that she survives but with the two planned sequel films cancelled her ultimate fate is uncertain. In the 2010 live-action film, Yuki is an Earth Defense Force ace pilot who initially is at odds with Susumu, even after he saves her when debris from a destroyed Garmilas ship cripples her Cosmo Tiger fighter and ruptures her oxygen supply. Upon arriving at Iscandar/Garmilas, her body becomes the host of Iscandar's power to restore Earth's atmosphere. : In 2199 Mori is a staff officer at UN Cosmo Force headquarters serving under Admiral Hijikata, who has been her guardian since her parents were killed in a car crash which also gave her amnesia. It is later revealed she had been acting as a guide to Princess Yurisha of Iscandar, who had brought plans for the faster-than-light-flight enabled Wave Motion Engine. Assigned to the Yamato as Operations Officer and is in charge of the ship's radar on the bridge, she often clashes with Kodai, though the two develop a mutual attraction as Kodai quickly adjusts to his role as Tactical Officer. She, mistaken for Yurisha, is kidnapped from the Yamato by Garmilan operatives and brought to the heart of the Garmilan empire by Desler who uses her as a hostage against Queen Starsha. She plays along although Desler knows who she really is. She eventually manages to sabotage the engine of Desler's ship before being ejected from the ship by her Zaltzi guard, eventually reuniting him with Kodai and the Yamato. Desler's personal guards shot her when he boarded the Yamato, and dies a few weeks later just as the Earth ship reaches the solar system despite Dr. Sado's efforts; but is restored to life by the Cosmo Reverse Device. By the start of 2202: Warriors of Love Mori and Kodai are engaged and Mori is again working at UNCF headquarters. Mori breaks off her engagement to Kodai when he insists she remain behind on Earth when the Yamato veterans re-unite to steal the ship for the journey to Telezart. She embarks with the crew in hiding and becomes a nurse until Kodai encounters her. She then returns to her former role as Operations Officer and radar operator. :* Japanese voice artist: Yōko Asagami, Noriko Yume (Yamato Rebirth), Houko Kuwashima (2199) :* American voice artist: Amy Howard Wilson (seasons 1 & 2), Corinne Orr (season 3), Mallorie Rodak (2199) :* Live-action actress: Meisa Kuroki * ' ('Mark Venture, also known as Shane O'Toole in the English dub of the first Yamato movie): A quieter and more level-headed complement to his best friend Kodai, Shima becomes chief navigator and helmsman of the Yamato. He suffers from a lack of self-confidence in his ability to control the mighty vessel, despite skillfully saving it on many occasions. Shima and Kodai have frequent arguments in the first series, some of which escalated into physical brawls, but the end results only made their friendship stronger. In the second season, he falls in love with Teresa (Trelaina) of Telezart by interstellar radio, and is heartbroken when she elects to remain on her world in the face of the Comet Empire, though he vows to carry on the fight in her name. He was blown into space by Gamillas troops but was rescued and revived by Teresa. He loses his life in the line of duty in Final Yamato. In the 2010 live-action film, Shima is a widower, having lost his pregnant wife in the first year of the war after a Garmilas missile destroyed the space station where she had lived. Their son was saved, but was rendered mute. : In 2199, like Kodai, he begins the series as a freshly graduated cadet officer and is suddenly promoted to command the Navigation division aboard the Yamato and acts as the ship's helmsman. He and Kodai remain close friends despite several disputes. Shima is recruited by Kaoru Niimi and Shinya Ito, members of a faction whose plans were scrapped by the Yamato's launch, to mutiny and return home with the plan to abandon Earth and resettle the human population on Beemela 4. Ito installs Shima as commander with the intention of killing Okita and Sanada and leaving Kodai behind on Beemela 4. Shima is instrumental in dismantling that mutiny as he is recruited by Ito's deputy Toru Hoshina, who himself was planted aboard the ship by Director Todo as an undercover investigator, aware that there might be rebels aboard the ship planning to sabotage the mission to Iscandar. In the sequel series 2202: Warriors of Love Shima has left the military and is captain of a transport ship when he receives the call from Teresa of Telezart. He is reluctant to commit to Kodai's plan to steal the Yamato and only boards the ship as it appears the plan will succeed. :* Japanese voice artist: Shūsei Nakamura, Isao Sasaki (Final Yamato), Hideyuki Tanaka (PlayStation 2 games), Kenichi Suzumura (2199) :* American voice artist: Tom Tweedy (seasons 1 & 2), Peter Fernandez (season 3), Ricco Fajardo (2199) :* Live-action actor: Naoto Ogata * ' (Jordy Venture): Shima's pre-pubescent younger brother who remains on Earth during the series. He remains confident in the ability of Yamato to save the world, particularly with his older brother at the helm, and even in the face of public doubt. His Japanese given name means \\"second son\\". He re- appears in Resurrection as a Cosmo Navy officer working as adjutant to Admiral Sanada. ** Japanese voice artist: Junko Sakata (season 1), Noriko Ohara (season 2), Chika Sakamoto (Final), Ryōtarō Okiayu (Rebirth) * ' ('Stephen Sandor): The science officer aboard Yamato, Sanada is earnest and dedicated, his ideas frequently saving the ship from destruction. His limbs are bionic, the result of a childhood accident which claimed the life of his sister and left him bitterly resentful of science's arrogance. He was a classmate of Mamoru Kodai, and blames himself for not having repaired the Yukikaze properly before it went into battle. When Susumu Kodai becomes acting captain, Sanada is frequently a source of advice. Sanada is the elder spokesperson for the crew after the deaths of Okita and Engineer Tokugawa. Along with Kodai, Mori and Sado he is a rare survivor all the way to the end of the original series in Resurrection where he has risen to a command rank in the military. In the 2010 live-action film, Sanada sacrifices his life while detonating a bomb that destroys the Gamillas power supply on the planet Iscandar/Gamillas. : In 2199, Sanada is often seen with an anthology of Chūya Nakahara's poems, a gift from Mamoru. The \\"bionic limbs\\" subplot was removed, and is depicted as having been Mamoru Kodai's closest friend from school. He is a scientist having been pivotal in adapting Wave Motion Energy to the Yamato and developing the Wave Motion Gun independently from Iscandarian science. He is older than most of the bridge officers and serves as the Yamato's executive officer as leader of the Technology division, taking command during Okita's bouts of illness. He eventually confides to Kodai his guilt over not warning Mamoru Kodai of the dangers of the battle of Pluto and how it was only being fought to cover the secret arrival of Princess Sasha's arrival on earth with the Yamato's warp core. Sanada was intending at the time to sacrifice his life to activate the warp gateway allowing Yamato to take over a month off their journey to Iscandar, but survives after finding a way to hide from the neutrino radiation bombardment that would have killed him. Out of that a friendship is formed between Sanada and Kodai and a mutual respect. In Odyssey of the Celestial Ark, Sanada's increasing trust on Kodai allows him to give Kodai command during the first encounter with Gatlantean warships. When the rebellion to steal the Yamato begins Sanada gives Kodai command of the Yamato noting he is much better suited to the role and remains the ship's Executive Officer. Sanada joins Kodai and Hajime Saito on Telezart to meet Teresa. :* Japanese voice artist: Takeshi Aono (Original), Hōchū Ōtsuka (2199) :* American Voice Artist: Phil Parsons (2199) :* Live-action actor: Toshirō Yanagiba * Dr. ' (Dr. Sane): The most humorously drawn character in the series, Dr. Sado is frequently a source of comic relief, usually through pratfalls resulting from his love of Japanese wine (sake). Though originally a vet (albeit an unsuccessful one), he becomes the ship's surgeon. He is good humored and always willing to give advice, but he can become deadly earnest when chiding others' behavior. His Japanese given name is written with the same kanji as the word shuzo (\\"sake brewing\\"), though his drinking habits were significantly toned down for Star Blazers, his sake given as spring water or soy milk. Along with Kodai, Mori and Sanada, he survives through to the series end in Resurrection where he has returned to veterinary science running an animal sanctuary with Kodai and Mori's daughter Miyuki Kodai. For the 2010 live- action film, Dr. Sado is rewritten as a female character who only occasionally drinks sake. : In 2199 Sado, despite his sake-swilling ways retained, is portrayed as a respected surgeon whose part of his resume is being involved with treating Yuki Mori and Princess Yurisha of Iscandar after a car crash. He is assigned to the Yamato as Medical Officer, as a warship on such a journey is likely to need a surgeon. In addition Sado goes on orders as additional safeguard against Captain Okita's failing health. He is both a cheerful and irascible presence aboard the Yamato and is seen on numerous occasions berating Sanada for exposing Okita to stressful situations as the two are among the very few onboard who is aware of Okita's health. Along with Hikozaemon Tokugawa, he is one of Okita's confidants and friends and is the last to see Okita alive when the Captain asks he to step outside his cabin so he can die having accomplished his goal of seeing the Yamato return to Earth. He has been retired from military service in 2202 when he gathers the crew together on the third anniversary of Okita's death at a statue erected in his honor. It is at this gathering that the crew discussing the summoning from Teresa and begin to plan their response. Sado joins the crew in stealing the Yamato. He helps Yuki Mori in hiding from Kodai after he prevented her from joining the crew. He spends time with the wounded Admiral Hijikata after the rescue of the Planet 11 survivors and the two discuss with Mori how best to support Kodai's command. :* Japanese voice artist: Ichirō Nagai (original), Shigeru Chiba (2199) :* American voice artist: Frank Pita (original), Kenny Green (2199) :* Live-action actress: Reiko Takashima * ' ('Mimi): Dr. Sado's pet cat, apparently the closest he has to family. Left behind on Earth during the first season, he is brought aboard the Yamato in the second season. He is based on Leiji Matsumoto's own cat Mī-kun. Note that in Star Blazers Mimi is female. Mi-kun has also appeared in other Leijiverse stories such as Captain Harlock where he was Doctor Zero's cat. ** Japanese voice artist: Kōichi Yamadera (PlayStation games) * ' (IQ-9): A squat, human-sized robot who originally worked in the EDF's hospital, Analyzer joins the Yamato crew on his own request, believing it to be the only place he can truly prove himself. He is capable of extending his arms, separating into independently moving pieces, lifting and throwing enemy tanks, withstanding force fields and sensing various forms of energy, but is unable to restrain himself from sexually harassing Yuki on several occasions (not shown in Star Blazers). He is in fact in love with her, but when she proves unable to return his affections, he settles for friendship. Something of a wisecracker, he frequently forms a double-act with Dr. Sado. He is also capable of becoming intoxicated, narrowly avoiding disaster on one occasion (though in Star Blazers he states that he has programmed himself to emulate human hiccups). In the 2010 live-action film, Analyzer is Susumu's robot assistant in a smartphone-like device carried by the latter. His physical body is stored in Susumu's Cosmo Zero unit, and is deployed in combat during the raid of Iscandar/Garmilas. Analyzer is ultimately destroyed by the overwhelming number of Garmilan troops. In 2199, Analyzer is illustrated just like the original, but the robot is portrayed as the purpose built autonomous sub-computer of the Yamato, and is more behaved and a bit of a deadpan. Analyzer is equipped with a \\"suit\\" that expands his capabilities, though used only once in Beemela-4. He is later often seen with Dr. Sado pouring sake for him. ** Japanese voice artist: Ken'ichi Ogata (original), Chō (2199) ** American voice artist: Sonny Strait (2199) * Chief ' (Chief Patrick Orion'): The middle-aged, balding chief engineer aboard Yamato and an old comrade of Okita. He left behind a grandchild on Earth of whom he is extremely fond. Determined to remain at his post no matter what happens, he suffocates in the last episode of the second season as the engine room fills with fumes. His death was not shown in Star Blazers. In the 2010 live-action film, he is killed during the attack by Desler's ship upon the Yamato's arrival near Earth. He made it to the end in 2199, him being the man Okita can trust with the Yamato's engine. He, owing to their seniority (he is actually two months away from retirement when he was called to the Yamato), is also one of a few people aboard the Yamato with strong influential power other than Captain Okita, the others being XO Sanada, Dr. Sado, and Engineer Yamazaki. ** Japanese voice artist: Ichirō Nagai (original), Mugihito (2199) ** American voice artist: Gordon Ramsay (original), R Bruce Elliot (2199) ** Live-action actor: Toshiyuki Nishida * ' (Travis Sparks): Tokugawa's portly assistant engineer. He believes the Yamato is doomed to fail in its mission to save Earth, and thus decides that humanity should make a new home on Iscandar; hence he and nine other mutineers kidnapping Yuki (their \\"Eve\\") to a crystal island, where a tsunami and volcanic eruption killed them, though Yuki is rescued. His death and the deaths of the other mutineers is not shown in Star Blazers, but indicated from later dialogue. In 2199 the mutiny occurs much earlier at Beemela 4, as he is part of a faction that supports their stay on Beemela, though they were overcome and arrested. Yabu is one of two mutineers to survive after the brig is damaged in a subsequent battle and is accidentally left behind on the Garmilas prison planet Leptapoda. Assumed to be of the Zaltzi race, he joins Captain Flakken's ragtag crew aboard the Garmilas dimensional submarine UX-01, who later helped sink General Goer's fleet. ** Japanese voice artist: Michihiro Ikemizu (episode 14), Ken'ichi Ogata (episode 25), Chō (2199) ** American voice artist: Ben Phillips (2199) * ' ('Homer Glitchman): Chief communications officer, Aihara becomes homesick for his native Kitakami, Iwate during the journey to Iscandar after discovering his father on Earth was dying. In his madness, he steals a spacesuit and attempts to float home before being rescued by his comrades. Note that in Japanese, the kanji for his given name can be read in two ways; the reading \\"Yoshikazu\\" is used in episode 10 of the first season, but (owing to an error) he gives his name as \\"Giichi\\" in the third season. For the 2010 live-action film, Aihara is rewritten as a female character. In 2199 he is a cheerful character and serves as Mori's deputy as communications officer. In 2202 he has joined Kodai and Nanbu. ** Japanese voice artist: Shinji Nomura (original), Masato Kokubun (2199) ** American voice artist: Michael Bertolini (original), Aaron Roberts (2199) ** Live-action actress: Maiko * ' (Dash): Bespectacled sub-chief of ship's defenses, operating the gun turrets in Kodai's absence, in 2199 he falls in love with Yuki, however is disappointed when he finds Kodai speaking to her instead. ** Japanese voice artist: Kazuo Hayashi (original), Kenji Akabane (2199) ** American voice artist: Eddie Allen (original), Stephen Fu (2199) ** Live-action actor: Toshihiro Yashiba * ' ('Christopher Eager): Portly, freckled radar operator, frequently heard identifying missile attacks on the Yamato. ** Japanese voice artist: Yoshito Yasuhara, Hirotaka Suzuoki (season 3), Yūki Chiba (2199) ** Live-action actor: Kensuke Ōwada * ' (Peter 'Pete' Conroy): The leader of the Black Tiger fighter squadron (second in authority to Kodai), Kato is a gifted though level-headed pilot, often putting his life on the line for his comrades. In the second season he is leader of the first squadron of the Cosmo Tigers, piloting a later model of fighter craft and stationed on the Moon; he and his men volunteer to join the Yamato under Kodai's command. He dies flying Kodai and Sanada back to the Yamato safely; however, this was covered up in Star Blazers, and indeed the original Japanese makers appeared to regret killing the character, as they later introduced his identical twin. In 2199, Kodai and Shima ran afoul of him when he punched them for stealing and crashing his personal Cosmo Zero. The beef between him and Kodai went as so far as warning Kodai that, even if he is his commanding officer, he will never forgive him if he sends any of his men to a needless death. Kato's disdain for Kodai slowly disappeared as Kodai gradually earned his respect throughout the course of the series. He is portrayed as the son of a priest, and he is sometimes heard chanting whenever he is aboard his plane or playing darts in their waiting room. He is also portrayed as a traditional guy, preferring that he and Makoto wear traditional clothing during their wedding (which she vetoed). ** Japanese voice actor: Akira Kamiya, Keaton Yamada (eps 8-10 only), Yoshimasa Hosoya (2199) ** American voice actor: Mike McFarland (2199) ** Live-action actor: Kazuki Namioka * ' ('Jefferson Davis Hardy): One of the Black Tiger pilots, recognizable by the lock of hair covering his eyes, Yamamoto has only one appearance in the first season, in which his fighter is shot down just before the Yamato undergoes a major warp speed test. Almost left behind, he is waved into the hangar by Kodai, and is injured in a crash-landing. He has a more significant presence in the second season, as commander of the Cosmo Tigers' second squadron; his plane is also stolen by the space marine Saito, who towers over him. He is killed in the final attack on the Comet Empire when his plane is shot down and crashes (not shown in Star Blazers). In 2199, Yamamoto is seen as a female fighter pilot with a brother who was KIA. Yamamoto has more appearances fighting alongside Kodai in a Cosmo Zero (Alpha 2). In Star Blazers he was given a southern United States accent, and in his single first season appearance, he was mistakenly referred to as Conroy. ** Japanese voice artist: Kazuyuki Sogabe, Rie Tanaka (2199) ** American voice artist: Jeannie Tirado (2199) ** Live-action actor: Takumi Saito * Admiral ' (Earth Commander Charles Singleton): Mustached leader of the Earth Defense Force, who in the first season sends the Yamato on its voyage to Iscandar to save the world, and reports to it via long-distance communication (though, in 2199, the Yamato only communicated with him whenever the ship is within the heliosphere). In the second season, he attempts to stop Kodai and the other crew from stealing the Yamato, but becomes convinced by their faith that he must let them go, as they are \\"Okita's children\\". His Japanese name is believed to come either from Tōdō Heisuke of the Shinsengumi, or Admiral Heihachiro Togo. ** Japanese voice artist: Masatō Ibu (original), Shinji Ogawa (2199) ** American voice artist: Bradley Campbell (2199) ** Live-action actor: Isao Hashizume * Cook ' ('Mel \\"Slops\\" Mulligan): Chief cook of the Yamato galley.

Matsumoto would more directly base another character on Shintani in the form of Yattaran from the Captain Harlock series. ** Japanese voice artist: Akira Kimura * ' (Frederick Lance): One of the Yamato's Commandos, he accompanies Kodai on the mission to destroy the Reflection Satellite Gun on Pluto. He is electrocuted when he steps into an electrified corridor. His death was covered up in Star Blazers, and his survival is further implied by an off-hand reference to \\"Lance\\" in a subsequent episode. * ' ('Harold Kato): Another commando on the mission to destroy the Reflection Satellite Gun on Pluto, he is shot by guards protecting the gun. His death was edited out of Star Blazers. * (Merrill Ryder): A member of the Navigation Group, he is seen on the 2nd Bridge during the coffee break in episode 15.  Second season  * Captain ' (Captain Draco Gideon): A famous captain whose battle tactics are legendary, and is given command of the new super-battleship Andromeda. Kodai comes to his attention when the Yamato refuses to give way to the larger ship; initially dismissing the acting captain as an upstart, he is charged with preventing Kodai from stealing the Yamato, but the younger man's confidence inspires him to let him leave. Hijikata later leads the EDF's battle against the Comet Empire's fleet, and it is only his inspired thinking that defeats them. He is ultimately killed battling against the Comet Empire's space station, Gatlantis, when he rams the Andromeda into it in order to give the Yamato time to escape. Before he does so, he tells Kodai Gatlantis' weak point is its lower hemisphere. In the alternate version of the story presented in Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato, Hijikata is the captain of a crippled spaceship at the edge of the Solar System who assumes command of the Yamato when rescued, but dies during the battle against the Comet Empire. He appears earlier in 2199 as Yuki Mori's guardian and a comrade of Captain Okita, who tried convincing him that he should go in his place, given his condition. ** Japanese voice artist: Akira Kimura (original), Unshō Ishizuka (2199) **American voice actor: Bill Jenkins (2199) * (General Stone): Staff officer at EDF HQ under the command of Heikuro Todo.

This includes using magnetic missiles and the Battle Satellite. ** Japanese voice artist: Mahito Tsumura * Company Commander ' (Sergeant Webb Knox'): The commander of the Space Cavalry (空間騎兵隊 Kūkan Kiheitai) 1st Armored Division stationed on Planet 11, rescued by the Yamato after a fierce Comet Empire attack. Uncouth and belligerent, he and his men refuse to respect the crew of their new home and frequently get into fights, frustrated at their reduced role as \\"passengers\\". However, on the surface of planet Telezart, inside Desler's flagship and within the Comet Empire's own space station, Saito and his men prove their worth in ground combat. Saito is the last surviving member of the team, and sacrifices himself to detonate explosives in the Comet Empire's power centre (though in Star Blazers it was indicated that he escaped). In the 2010 live-action film, Saito is briefly possessed by Desler, who uses his body to tell the Yamato crew of Garmilas' true motives of bombarding Earth. Saito wears a Hachiman amulet, as his mother believes it will shield him from physical harm. Ultimately, he is killed while covering for Sanada during the raid of Iscandar/Gamillas. ** Japanese voice artist: Isao Sasaki ** American voice artist: Chris Latta ** Live-action actor: Hiroyuki Ikeuchi * (Corporal Kane): Second-in-Command of the Space Marines.

He tortured Mazor in a futile attempt at extracting intelligence from him. ** Japanese voice artist: Rokurō Naya * ' (Neville Q. Royster): An extremely nerdy (and comically drawn) scientist cadet, addressed by all but Kodai—including his superior officer and senpai Sanada—as shinmai (meaning \\"newbie\\" or \\"boot\\", but also being a different reading of the kanji in his family name). Despite his clumsiness, he proves his worth as a scientist and engineer, and in one episode comes up with an idea to use the wave motion gun as propulsion to save the ship that even Sanada did not think of. He is killed in the final battle against the Comet Empire shortly after locating Gatlantis's power centre (not shown in Star Blazers). ** Japanese voice artist: Yūji Mitsuya  Yamato: The New Voyage  * ' ('Orion): Son of the late Chief Tokugawa, he is a cadet training to follow in his father's footsteps.

Drawn to investigating the central core, she allowed within her the consciousness of Yurisha Iscandar, whose body was being transported home in cold sleep due to Yurisha's comatose state as a result of a traffic accident on Earth. When necessary, Yurisha's personality dominates, then allows Yuria to resurface. The two personalities can be distinguished both by behavior and by hair style. Yuria wears her hear bound in twin pig- tails, Yurisha wears her hair loose. The association proves to be anywhere from useful to life-saving starting from episode 14.

She sends her sister Sasha to the Solar System bearing this message, together with plans for a faster-than-light space drive. However, when the Yamato arrives, she confesses that she had actually possessed the means to send the device to Earth, but had wanted to test humanity's worthiness to survive, an action she regrets. Though willing to help Earth, she chooses to remain on her homeworld and face its ultimate fate with dignity. She has also rescued and healed Mamoru Kodai, who chooses to remain with her. In Yamato: The New Journey she sends her husband and child (also named Sasha) away from Iscandar before detonating the planet's doomsday bomb in order to defeat the plans of the Black Nebula and prevent Desler from sacrificing himself. Her spirit appears to her daughter in Be Forever, Yamato. She and Sasha are nearly identical in appearance to Yuki (albeit longer-haired), though this is a coincidence. In 2199, she did not only give the Cosmo-Cleaner-D/Cosmo Reverse System, but also reworked the Yamato to be the device itself (which involved sealing the Wave Motion Gun port). It is also implied that before Mamoru Kodai died, they may have fallen in love with each other and left Starsha with a child (episode 24). The character of Starsha does not appear in the 2010 live-action film, but Miyuki Ueda does the voice of the spiritual embodiment of Iscandar. ** Japanese voice artist: Michiko Hirai (season 1), Miyuki Ueda (New Voyage and Be Forever), Kikuko Inoue (2199) ** American voice artist: Lydia Leeds (original), Monica Rial (2199) * ' (Astra): Starsha's identical sister, also of royal blood. Sasha travels to the Solar System to deliver Starsha's message to Earth, but her ship is shot down and crashes on Mars. After leaving her escape pod she suffocates in the Martian atmosphere before being found by Kodai and Shima. In 2199, the last active earth fleet distracted the Garmilans from noticing the arrival of her ship (codenamed Amaterasu). Her ship encounters engine failure just before landing on Mars and, despite using an escape pod, she perished when Kodai and Shima found her. * Yurisha: In the 2199 series, she is the second Iscandarian princess who went ahead of Sasha to deliver the blueprints for the Wave Motion Engine. She met an accident on Earth which involved Yuki Mori and became comatose. She was loaded onboard the Yamato in that state in a capsule as the core of the ship's Automatic Navigation System, as they need her memories as the humans even don't know where Iscandar is despite having maps supplied to them—a kept secret until Captain Okita revealed it to the crew. She possessed Yuria Misaki at first to manifest her presence and her consciousness until she awakens from her coma, and remained as an observer who reported to Queen Starsha later. She reveals to Yuki that the Yamato actually making it to Iscandar is a requirement for the Cosmo Reverse System to work. She stayed on Iscandar with Melda Ditz as her aide in helping the people of Garmilas. She considers Yuki as her \\"one- time other self,\\" as they are nearly identical in looks. ** Japanese voice artist: Houko Kuwashima (2199) ** American voice artist: Mallorie Rodak (2199) * ' ('Trelaina): A telepathic young woman living on the planet Telezart in a hovering palace, who has mastered anti-matter (according to the English dub) and whose prayers generate a powerful energy. She watched her world, an interstellar hub, degenerate into all-out war, but prayed so fervently that she destroyed all life forms. When the Comet Empire threatens our Galaxy, she sends messages to Earth attempting to warn them of the danger, bringing the Yamato to her world; during the Earth ship's journey she falls in love with Shima over radio. However, though she refuses to leave her world and become a part of Earth, her love for Shima overcomes her pacifism and she uses her psionic power to transform Telezart into pure energy and detonates it directly in the path of the Comet Empire in an attempt to destroy it. While the Comet Empire's plasma shield keeps them from being destroyed, Teresa's efforts blow it off its flight path and causes it heavy damage, enabling the Yamato to arrive in the Milky Way ahead of it. She survives in her spacecraft and travels to the Solar System, where she discovers Shima's corpse floating in space and resuscitates him using her own blood. With her last remaining power, she then destroys Zwordar's dreadnaught and saves Earth from destruction. What becomes of her after this is unclear. While some fans believe Teresa sacrificed her life to destroy Zwordar, others believe she is still alive somewhere in the universe, given that she easily survived the destruction of Telezart. In the alternate version of the story told in the movie Farewell to Space Battleship Yamato, Teresa plays a similar role, but she is composed entirely of anti-matter (and naked), and does not fall in love with Shima. Moreover, at the end of the movie she does not destroy Zwordar's ship, but instead her spirit urges Kodai to do so using the Yamato. ** Japanese voice artist: Mari Okamoto, (Miyuki Ueda (Arrivederci, Yamato) ** American voice artist: Lydia Leeds (original) * Princess ' (Mariposa) ** Japanese voice artist: Keiko Han ** American voice artist: Corinne Orr * Lord Desler: See below.  Garmilas  The Garmilans are a race of humanoids from the planet Garmilas in the Large Magellanic Cloud, 148,000 light years from Earth. They are biologically indistinguishable from humans aside from their blue skin (although, owing to early series production decisions, they were given human- colored skin for the first ten episodes of the original series). Many of those who appear in the series are named after high-ranking members of the Nazi party. Garmilan civilians seldom appear in the original series implying that it is a highly militarized society, and the few female Garmilans who appear in the series are invariably concubines. In the remake, the Garmilan society is shown with more detail, depicting most Garmilan soldiers as family men, and some females are featured as part of the military as well. In the 2010 live- action film, the Garmilans are depicted as a more alien-like race with a hive mind. * ' (Leader Desslok'): Leader of the militant people of the dying planet Garmilas, Desler intends to wipe out the human \\"barbarians\\" and migrate his people to Earth. Initially contemptuous of humanity and its struggles to survive, he comes to respect the Yamato as it surpasses endless trials on its journey to Iscandar. He even attempts to use his dying, volcanically active planet as a weapon against the Earth ship, but the ensuing battle results in the near-total destruction of his civilization, and he swears revenge. Apparently killed at the end of the first season when his own Desler cannon backfires and destroys his flagship, he re-emerges in the second season having been resuscitated by the advanced medicine of the Comet Empire. Emperor Zordar grants him the chance to destroy the Yamato, but ultimately he comes to realize that his desire for revenge has made him no better than the Comet Empire, who live solely for conquest; it is Yuki's attempt to protect a wounded Kodai that convinces him that humans are capable of the same love he feels for his people, and he withdraws from battle, aiming to rebuild his civilization (which becomes known as the Galman-Garmillas Empire). Before departing, in the Comet Empire series, he shares an important detail about a potential weakness in the White Comet fortress. :Although initially an enemy to Earth, he informs Earth Defense Force of the dire situation planet Iscandar was in when he returned to Garmilas to find the Black Nebula Force mining for resources to fuel their war machine. He later becomes an ally of the Yamato when Iscandar was plunged into deep space after Garmilas exploded, and the Black Nebula forces pursued the planet and threatened Starsha. Working together with the crew of Yamato, his bitterness lifted and he acclaimed his love for Starsha. Starsha however sacrifices herself and her planet to stop the giant Black Nebulan battle fortress sent to secure the planet's resources for war purposes. Because of her sacrifice, Desler had a renewed sensation of love and peace which he had never realized was inside his heart. He departs at the end of the battle on good terms with Earth and Yamato. :A couple of years after the destruction of Garmilas, Desler wanders the Milky Way Galaxy, and finds his ancestral home planet Galmania which is occupied by the Bolar Federation. He quickly mounts a counter-attack to free his people, and in doing so proclaims himself as the new Emperor, set on ridding the galaxy of the cruel Bolars. However, because of his quick quest to secure the entire Milky Way Galaxy, his officers become war-mongers who would use planet- destroying hyperion missiles to eliminate any enemy or resistance. One such missile had gone astray and struck Earth's Sun causing accelerated nuclear fusion to the point that the Sun was to explode in less than a year. In response to Earth's dire situation, and unaware that Desler's empire is responsible for it, Yamato was sent to search for a new planet suitable for human habitation. The Yamato was attacked by Galman forces when they intervened in a conflict in a neighboring system, Berth. Because of the intervention, Galman officers and generals made it a top priority to destroy or capture the ship. Yamato was trapped inside the hangar of a mobile super fortress of the Galman Eastern Task Force fortress, and taken to be presented to Desler. Upon presentation, Desler flew into a rage at his generals' failure to obey his order to stay far from Earth's solar system, and apologized to the crew of Yamato. He then learned that his empire was the cause of Earth's plight. He offered to help Earth by dispatching a fleet of the empire's best scientists to restore the proper nuclear fusion to the Sun. This however proved to be futile, and the Sun worsened from their manipulation. Out of scientific ideas, he provides coordinates to a planet like Earth called Phantom. Phantom however turned out to be a unsuitable planet, as it was a living organism able to telepathically camouflage itself as a planet to protect Queen Mariposa from the Bolars. Upon Yamato's discovery of this fact, Queen Mariposa is escorted and protected by the crew of Yamato to her home planet, Guardiana, where she offers the Hydro-Cosmogen cannon to correct the Sun's erratic nuclear fusion. Desler, following Yamato, learns of the Queen's home planet, and decides to peacefully add planet Guardiana to his empire so as to sway all people of the galaxy (Galman and Bolar) towards peace as her people's culture are pacifists and peace-talkers. Stability and peace is spread throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. :It is, however, not until the film, Final Yamato, when the people of Dinguil try to conquer Earth by using Aquarius to bring massive floods, that Desler performs one last act of assistance for Earth. The Denguilan fleet surrounds the Yamato which, having been converted into an H-bomb to block the column of water hurling towards Earth, was unable to fight. Desler launches a surprise attack on the fleet, and destroys its capitol ship using his Desler cannon. The attack comes as a surprise to the Yamato's crew as well, as they had assumed that Desler had been killed when Galmania had collided with another planet earlier in the film. In the last scene, when Yamato detonates to stop the 10-trillion-ton water column from hitting Earth, Desler is seen atop his ship silently watching the Yamato settle in an ocean in space. :For the live-action film, Desler has no physical form; instead, he appears as one or more multiple crystals and initially possesses Hajime Saito's body to tell the Yamato crew the true motive of his race's attack on Earth. :His Japanese name is believed to come from Nazi Germany's Adolf Hitler, and Desler's title is the Japanese translation of führer. Leiji Matsumoto has claimed this similarity is in fact a coincidence, and that Desler comes from \\"Death-Ra\\" (also written as デスラー in Japanese). :* Japanese voice artist: Masato Ibu (Season 1), Kouichi Yamadera (2199) :* American voice artist: Eddie Allen (seasons 1 & 2), Chris Rager (2199) * Vice Leader '/General ' (General Krypt): Desler's toadying right-hand man, Hiss tries his best to please his leader, apologizing for every embarrassing mistake and passing his anger on to his underlings. However, during the climactic battle on Garmilas he implores Desler to make peace with the humans, earning him a bullet in the chest (not shown in Star Blazers, in its place is a reuse of dialogue footage between Desler and Hiss where Desslok now merely reprimands Krypt for engaging in defeatist talk). In the first ten episodes, Hiss has the title of Vice Leader (副総統). With episode eleven, his title changes to General (将軍). ** Japanese voice artist: Keisuke Yamashita (Season 1), Yousuke Akimoto (2199) ** American voice artist: Ray Gestaut (2199) * Commanders ' and ' (Colonel Ganz and Major Bane): The leaders of the Garmilans' frontline base on Pluto, Valke Shultz and Gelf Gantz are among the first to encounter the dangerous new Earth ship Yamato. However, even armed with a powerful weapon, the Reflection Satellite Cannon (Reflex Gun in Star Blazers), the bumbling duo are unable to stop the Earth ship and are forced to abandon their base. Recognizing that they can never return home in disgrace, Shultz orders the entire fleet to launch an all-out attack on the Yamato, but they are destroyed; Shultz's command ship attempts a kamikaze run (though in Star Blazers this was toned down to an accidental near-collision) before being deflected into an asteroid. ** Japanese voice artists: Takeshi Obayashi (Shultz) and Kenichi Ogata (Gantz); Yu Shimaka (Shultz) and Chō (Gantz) (2199) ** American voice artists: Mark Stoddard (Shultz) and Tyson Rinehart (Ganz) (2199) * General ' (General Talan / Sergeant Masterson): One of Desler's most loyal generals, Talan appears only twice in the first season; however, in the second season he has a more significant presence, as commander of the scattered remnants of the Garmilan empire. He is more level-headed than his leader and is able to convince Desler to abandon his flagship when all is lost. He is also an extremely skillful pilot, rescuing Desler from the Comet Empire's pursuing ships. He was mistakenly renamed \\"Sgt. Masterson\\" in season 3 of Star Blazers. ** Japanese voice artist: Kōji Yada (original), Yutaka Aoyama (as \\"Wielte Talan,\\" 2199) ** American voice artist: Chuck Huber (as \\"Wielte Talan,\\" 2199) * General ' (General Lysis'): A famed general with many victories under his belt, and a powerful physique to match his ego, Domel is put in charge of the campaign against Earth and offers to destroy the Yamato in his leader's name. However, despite using both outright force and psychological warfare, he too is defeated in battle time and again, culminating in a scheme to destroy the Earth ship on planet Balun which succeeds only in the destruction of the Garmilan base there. Offered one last battle for honor, he challenges the Yamato to meet him at the Rainbow Cluster; so meticulous is his planning that he very nearly succeeds, and it is only quick thinking (and luck) on the part of the Yamato crew that destroys his fleet. He then attaches his command ship to the underside of the Yamato and self-destructs in a vain attempt to complete his mission (though in Star Blazers it was indicated he planted a bomb on the Argo's underside and detached. This was followed by a reuse of dialogue footage between Lysis and Vulgar now indicating that because the bomb's blast didn't destroy the Argo they were returning to Garmilas in disgrace). He is credited with the invention of a device called the Instant Matter Transporter (Space Matter Instant Transforming Equipment, or SMITE, in Star Blazers), capable of teleporting whole battle fleets into the vicinity of an enemy vessel, which is used later by Desler himself. ** Japanese voice artist: Osamu Kobayashi (Season 1), Akio Ohtsuka (2199) ** American voice artist: J. Michael Tatum (2199) * ' (Volgar/Vulgar): Garemund Goer is one-time commander of the Garmilans' waypoint base on planet Balun, he reacts to his replacement by Domel angrily, getting drunk and trashing his decadently decorated room (this scene was cut from Star Blazers). Desperate to prove himself to Desler, he attempts to fight the Yamato on his own terms, but is defeated resoundingly; he also informs Desler of Domel's plan to sacrifice the base in an attempt to destroy the Yamato, leading to a critical delay which enables the Earth ship to escape. However, he comes to admire Domel's loyalty to the Garmilan cause, and assists him in his battle for honor. In 2199, he served under General Herm Zoellick, and then under General Domel; and is once the superior to everyone in Pluto Base. He himself killed General Zoellick upon knowing that he plotted to assassinate Desler. He and his fleet was destroyed by Captain Flakken's dimensional submarine as he tried lure the Yamato into the hyperspace gate. ** Japanese voice artist: Osamu Saka (Season 1), Masashi Hirose (2199) ** American voice artist: Mike Czechopoulos (original), Barry Yandell (2199) * Captains ', ', ' and ': Captains who serve under Domel in the battle at the Rainbow Cluster, having earned great acclaim at, respectively, the Ruby, Sapphire, Diamond and Omega war fronts. The first three command space carriers and their respective fighter, dive-bomber, and torpedo plane air groups, while the last commands a battle carrier launching a single heavy bomber which carries a drill missile designed by Domel. All four captains fly into battle themselves alongside their men, though Kreuz is not shown (due to an oversight by the animators). ** Japanese voice artists: Kōji Yada (Heidern), Takeshi Aono (Berger), Ichirō Nagai (Getto), Isao Sakuma (Kreuz) * ' ('Garrat): Commander of a Garmillan battle carrier in season 2, he sends a fleet of dive- bombers to attack the Yamato when it is paralyzed by a swarm of corrosive bacteria. However, before he can destroy the Earth ship, his own vessel is similarly rendered powerless, and he is forced to retreat in disgrace. His humiliation earns him a bullet from Deslar (not shown in Star Blazers). ** Japanese voice artist: Hidekatsu Shibata * Generals ', ', ', ': Deslar's remaining generals in Season 2. ** Japanese voice artists: Eken Mine (Action), Yoshito Yasuhara (Frage), Kazuo Hayashi (Lugens), Kenichi Ogata (Meiser) Galman Empire * ' (Smeerdom) (v.a.

She later becomes a liaison for the rebel Garmilan forces aboard the Yamato until she stayed on Iscandar to help Princess Yurisha with the Garmilans. ** Voice actors: Shizuka Itou (Japanese), Katelyn Barr (English) * Elk Domel: In this series, he is depicted just like in the original, but he is much more serious and was realistically close to defeating the Yamato. However, despite openly avoiding it, he is eventually dragged into Garmilan politics when, just as he's about to finish the Yamato, he lets them go because he and his fleet were recalled to their homeworld so that he could stand trial for the attempted assassination of Desler. He is also depicted in the series as a soldier who praises his opponents, and just as tenacious as Captain Okita. ** Voice actors: Akio Otsuka (Japanese), J.

He is portrayed in the series as a more competent commander who actually nearly defeated the Yamato, though he and the rest of his Zaltzi crew are also preoccupied with their place in Garmilan society, to a point that they bypassed regular channels (that is, by avoiding to mention anything to General Goer) just to report their \\"victory\\" to Desler.

To this aim, he travels space in an enormous city-planet, Gatlantis, surrounded by a powerful plasma shield which resembles a gigantic comet, capable of annihilating planets in its path, and launching fleets of warships to conquer any useful worlds—or destroy them if they resist. Having subjugated the entire Andromeda Galaxy, his next target is Earth. Frustrated time and again by the incompetence of his minions—and interference from the mysterious Teresa of Telezart—he takes matters into his own hands at the end of the second season, launching a massive dreadnaught from the shattered remains of Gatlantis with the intent of destroying all life on Earth. His Japanese name is based on the word \\"sword\\". ** Japanese voice artist: Osamu Kobayashi ** Italian Voice Artist: Ivano Staccioli *Lady ' (Princess Invidia): Zwordar's mistress (his daughter in Star Blazers), though unlike other citizens of the Comet Empire she has pink skin.

It is her treachery that ruins the Gamilon leader's plan to destroy the Yamato and the main reason the Comet Empire falls.

History The railway line was built by three separate companies. In 1837 the Ulster Railway began building a railway line between Belfast and Lisburn, which was extended in stages to Portadown in 1842 and as far as Clones by 1863. The Dublin and Drogheda Railway (D&D;) built the line between Dublin and Drogheda. The Dublin and Belfast Junction Railway (D&B; Jct) linked the Dublin and Drogheda with the Ulster Railway at Portadown. The D&D; and the D&B; Jct merged in 1875 to form the Northern Railway of Ireland. In 1876 this new company merged with the Ulster Railway and the Irish North Western Railway, forming the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (GNRI). The partition of Ireland in 1922 meant that the Irish border passed between Newry and Dundalk, which caused lengthy delays as trains were required to stop at stations on either side of the border for customs examinations. This disruption was eased in 1947 with the opening of facilities for customs checks at Amiens Street station and Great Victoria Street station. At the same time, the GNRI made its Belfast-Dublin services non-stop with the launch of the Enterprise Express. The GNRI was nationalised by the governments of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in 1953 as the Great Northern Railway Board, but in 1958 this was split between the Ulster Transport Authority and Córas Iompair Éireann. This led to a running down of rail services in Northern Ireland, leaving only some Belfast commuter lines, the northern route to Derry and the link to Dublin. In 1970 the newly formed NI Railways bought new locomotives and rolling stock for the Belfast- Dublin Enterprise service as well as new diesel multiple units for local services.  Upgrades  In 2000, the government of the Republic of Ireland developed a National Development Plan, which has seen major investment in infrastructure. Almost the entire railway network, including the Belfast–Dublin line as far as the border, has been upgraded to Continuous Welded Rail, while signalling is controlled using the Centralised Traffic Control system located at Dublin Connolly station. In addition, in 1997, a set of new De Dietrich Stock coaches were purchased jointly by Northern Ireland Railways and Iarnród Éireann to operate a revamped Enterprise service along with the new Class 201 locomotives. High-speed rail proposal In 2020 the Irish Government confirmed it will be launching a study into an approximately 500 km high-speed railway from Belfast via Dublin to Cork and Limerick, which could cost around €15 billion.  Services  In addition to the inter-city service between Belfast and Dublin, both NIR and IÉ operate local services along the route. NIR operates local services along the northern half of the line (the Belfast–Newry line) between Belfast and Lisburn, Portadown and Newry, while IE operates its Commuter services between Dublin and Dundalk as part of the Dublin Suburban Rail network. In addition, the line between Dublin Connolly and Malahide is electrified and forms part of the DART network. One early morning weekday IÉ Commuter stopping service also operates from Newry to Dublin Connolly and returns to Newry in the evening. The line is also used by rail passengers changing at Dublin Connolly onto the DART and also by connecting bus travelling to Dublin Port for the Irish Ferries or Stena Line to Holyhead and then by train along the North Wales Coast Line to London Euston and other destinations in England and Wales.Holyhead National Rail Enquiries Holyhead can also be reached by Irish Ferries from Dublin Port, reached by walking beside the tram lines around the corner from Amiens Street into Store Street or by Luas four stops to Dublin Port or Dublin Bus route 53 or to take a taxi. *Dublin to Belfast intercity Monday to Saturday 8 trains in each direction Sunday 5 trains in each direction  Simulation  The route has been released as a commercial add on for Microsoft Train Simulator by Making Tracks. It was released in two sections, part one covering Lanyon Place to Dundalk, with part two covering the section from Dundalk to Dublin. It is set during the 2000s.

It generally parallels Interstate 10 (I-10) and State Route 60 (CA 60), and is the original alignment of U.S. Route 60 (US 60). The present north end of I-710 is at Valley Boulevard in Los Angeles, just west of Alhambra. Route description The road begins northeast of downtown Los Angeles at the intersection of North Main Street and North Mission Road, passing through the University Hills district at the northernmost edge of the Cal State LA campus and then through Alhambra. It ends at the interchange with CA 71 in Pomona, continuing east through Pomona as Holt Avenue and entering Montclair as Holt Boulevard. After Holt Boulevard passes through Ontario, it merges with I-10; a few miles eastward from there, another piece of Valley Boulevard splits from I-10 in Fontana, running through Rialto to I-10 in eastern Colton. When the old alignment next splits, in San Bernardino, it is known as Redlands Boulevard. Description Valley Boulevard (former US 60, US 70 and US 99) is a vital and growing professional and business sector that includes many Asian markets, eateries and other service-oriented businesses such as physicians and dentists. There are multiple Asian banks and Asian owned and operated enterprises that accommodate the burgeoning Asian population. The Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley follow along a stretch of Valley Boulevard covering the entire length of the San Gabriel Valley with Alhambra on the west side and Diamond Bar on the east side. Asian communities in the San Gabriel Valley extend as far north as San Marino and Arcadia and as far south as Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights. Valley Boulevard begins at Lincoln Park, off North Main Street near downtown Los Angeles, about a mile northeast of the downtown Los Angeles Chinatown. From North Main Street, Valley runs east along a five-mile (8 km) stretch including large industrial tracts and the largely Hispanic community of Lincoln Heights. Midway between downtown Chinatown to the west and the start of the ethnic Chinese suburbs to the east is the beautiful Ming Ya Buddhist Temple, on Valley Boulevard in Lincoln Heights. From Los Angeles, Valley Blvd. enters Alhambra, the \\"Gateway to the San Gabriel Valley\\". Alhambra, which is 47% Asian according to the 2000 census, has a large number of Asian businesses along Valley Boulevard. Alhambra's Valley Boulevard boasts numerous noodle shops, Asian cafés and the original Sam Woo Barbecue restaurant. The artful Wing Lung Bank features the largest glass tile mural in North America, composed of 996,000 3/4\\" glass tiles. Each year, Alhambra and San Gabriel host one of the largest Lunar Chinese New Year celebrations in the country which includes a parade along Valley Boulevard. San Gabriel Square Continuing east from Alhambra along Valley Boulevard are the cities of San Gabriel and Rosemead with San Marino, Temple City and Arcadia being further north and east. These five cities have Asian populations between 40 and 55% with a large number of Asian businesses in their various town centers. Along Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel are dozens of Asian mini-malls and hundreds of shops and restaurants. San Gabriel Square is one of the most prominent and features a 99 Ranch Market, several shops and restaurants including specialties such as Taiwanese and Vegetarian food. Valley Boulevard in San Gabriel also includes the comprehensive San Gabriel Superstore which includes multiple vendors anchored by a large grocery store. Inside and outside the Superstore are found numerous vendors of Asian art, jewelry, books, videos, clothing as well as health and beauty aids. Delicious round red and green bean pastries sold at a stand near the entrance. Continuing east from Rosemead further along Valley are the largely Hispanic communities of El Monte and La Puente and large industrial tracts, including those that dominate the City of Industry. This ten-mile-long (16 km), largely industrial corridor includes many Asian owned wholesale businesses, including importers of electronics, food and furniture from Asia. North of La Puente is West Covina which is 26% Asian and south of La Puente is Hacienda Heights which is 36% Asian Hacienda Heights is home to the Hsi Lai Temple, the largest Buddhist temple in the United States.http://www.hsilai.org/ accessed August 22, 2010 The temple encompasses and a floor area of . The temple's Ming Dynasty (1368–1644 AD) and Qing Dynasty (1644–1911 AD) architecture is faithful to the traditional style of buildings, Chinese gardens, and statuary of ancient Chinese monasteries. Hsi Lai was built to serve as a spiritual and cultural center for those interested in learning Buddhism and Chinese culture.http://www.hsilai.org/en/intro_subpages/intro_hsi_lai_temple.html accessed August 22, 2010 On the east side of the San Gabriel Valley, before Valley Boulevard becomes Holt Avenue in Pomona, are the communities of Rowland Heights, Walnut and Diamond Bar. These three communities each have Asian populations of between 50 and 60%. Rowland Heights offers its own mini ethnic suburbia, including the businesses lining Colima Road (about one mile (1.6 km) south of Valley), Fullerton Road and Nogales Street. Indoor malls in Rowland Heights feature fine restaurants and chic Asian boutiques. History Several old alignments are present: *In downtown El Monte, the old road is now Valley Mall; a new alignment has been built a block to the north. *A road named Old Valley Boulevard exists in La Puente, where the new alignment crosses over a railroad on a bridge. The old road originally crossed near Unruh Avenue, and later moved to Hacienda Boulevard. *The road originally crossed the railroads in western Pomona via Pomona Boulevard, present CA 71 and 2nd Street into downtown Pomona. The road was once known as Main Street between El Monte and La Puente and Pomona Boulevard between La Puente and Pomona. Main Street became Valley Boulevard between 1933 and 1942, and Pomona Boulevard was renamed (except for the old section in Pomona) by 1959.1959 Rand McNally Los Angeles and vicinity map When US 60 was first extended to Los Angeles ca. 1932, it ran along Valley Boulevard. The new alignment (Ramona Boulevard and Garvey Avenue, now partly the San Bernardino Freeway) was built ca. 1934, taking US 60 off Valley Boulevard. Pre-1964 Legislative Route 77 was defined in 1931 to run from downtown Los Angeles to Pomona along Valley Boulevard, and then to continue east to Riverside and south to San Diego. The part from the east city limit of Los Angeles (just east of the north end of CA 7, now I-710) to I-10 in El Monte was assigned the State Route 212 number in the 1964 renumbering, and in 1965 it was removed from the state highway system. Bus service from Downtown Los Angeles to El Monte is served by Metro Local line 76. Bus service east of El Monte is served by Foothill Transit line 194.

At its widest, the area is , and the greatest extent in a north-south direction is 80 km (50 mi). The Georgetown–Lethem Road dissects the forest, traversing about between the northeastern and southern boundaries. The forest lies between 4° and 5° north latitude and 58.5 and 59.5 degrees west longitude. The Iwokrama Forest is bordered to the west by the Pakaraima Mountains and to the east by the isolated highlands scattered through central-east Guyana. It is also bordered by savannahs in the southwest and northeast of Guyana. The Essequibo River forms the eastern boundary. The northern boundary is the Siparuni River. The Burro-Burro River runs through the centre, and most of its watershed is within the forest. The area is covered with lowland tropical forest, and dominated by tall tropical trees with a dense canopy 20 to 30 metres (70 to 100 ft) high.

The Transylvanus Palace in Brussels  Maximilianus Transylvanus had built a sumptuous Italian-style palace in Brussels opposite the Sablon church, which was celebrated in Latin verses by the poet Janus Secundus.  His castle near Brussels  Bouchout Castle in Meise, near Brussels, acquired in 1537 by Maximilianus Transylvanus He acquired in 1537 the Bouchout Castle in Meise, near Brussels.  His origins and paternity  Maximilianus Transylvanus' origins and paternity are a matter of dispute among historians.  Legend about his paternity  In spite of his surname, Transylvanus is said to have come from Flanders, not Transylvania, and to have been a natural or bastard son of Archbishop Lang von Wellenburg which is impossible because in 1490, when he is born, Mathäus Lang was a poor student in Tübingen, and the father of Transylvanus was then a wealthly goldsmith, living in Brussels. Lang von Wellenberg, born in 1469 to a burgher family, took holy orders much later in life (in 1519).  Flemish origins  Scholars point to a Flemish provenance due to the fact that: *Transylvanus was married to Frances, who was a niece of Christopher de Haro, the Lisbon-based merchant who was a friend of Magellan's as well as his financial backer. She was the daughter of Jacob de Haro, the head of a commercial firm based in Antwerp. *Transylvanus had many ties with Brussels. A piece of Latin poetry he wrote in Faria argues that Transylvanus received his surname from the fact that he was a member of one of the many diplomats sent to Transylvania, which was part of the Kingdom of Hungary. *Transylvanus died in Brussels around 1538. *Sigismund von Herberstein (1486-1566), the diplomat, writer, historian mentions him as Maximilian von Sibenpergen , while Konrad Peutinger (1465-1547) the humanists knows him as Maximilian Sybenberger, both clearly referring to his real surname \\"van Sevenbergen\\" which may have also derived from the Dutch town of \\"Zevenbergen\\" which is also the German name for Transylvania : Siebenbürgen. Both were also contemporaries and probably personal friends of Maximilianus.  The legend of a Transylvanian origin  In an 1891 letter to Notes and Queries, a scholar (identified only as \\"L.L.K.\\") wrote: :\\"I am anxious to trace the origin of the fable about the parentage of this writer. In several books and booksellers' catalogues, he is stated to be the natural son of Matthew Lang, Archbishop of Salzburg, (cf., e.g., The Life of Ferdinand Magellan, by Dr. Guillemard, p. 146). This is absolutely false. The father of Maximilian was a Transylvanian nobleman, who was killed in the battle of Mohács in 1526. Cf. the letter of Don Martin de Salinas to King Ferdinand, dated Valladolid, 11 March 1527, in Gayango's 'Spanish Calendar.' It has been suggested to me that a passage in Peter Martyr's Epistola DXLIII., dated \\"Guadaluppe III. Kal. Jan. 1515,\\" might have given rise to the fable; but the passage is so clear that it is difficult to imagine how it could be mistranslated.\\" In 1916, the same scholar wrote in to state: :\\"The Catalogue of the fifth portion of the Huth Collection is still repeating that ancient myth that Maximilian had addressed his famous letter De Moluccis Insulis to 'his father, the Cardinal Archbishop of Salzburg.' His father was 'Maître Luc dit Transilvain ou de Transilvanie (Van Sevenborge),\\" according to a deed seen by the late M. Alphonse Wauters. Cf. Histoire des Environs de Bruxells (1855), vol. ii. p. 288.\\" One of the main arguments in favor of Maximilianus' Transylvanian origin: The renowned humanist and Bishop of Pécs (later archbishop of Esztergom, Hungary) Nicolaus Olahus' 1534 dated letter mentions \\"noster Maximilianus Transylvanus\\", that is \\"our Transylvanian Maximilianus\\", with whom he became a close friend in Brussels bonded by the shared heritage: \\"Based on our common fatherland we are in great intimacy with one another, as he says, and I believe (pro ea, quae inter nos ob patriam communem intercedit familiaritas ut ipse dicit, ergo qouque ita credo, non vulgaris)”. It is also well known that Nicolaus Olahus was born in Hermannstadt (in Hungarian: Nagyszeben; today in Rumanian: Sibiu) in Transylvania. Fragment of the letter of Nicolaus Olahus (1534)  Works  In 1520, Transylvanus had published, at Augsburg, a work in Latin that describes the reception that nominated Charles I, King of Spain, as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 at Molins de Rei, in Spain. This is the Legatio ad sacratissimum ac invictum Caesarem divum Carolum .... ab reverendissimis et illustrissimis principibus ... qua functus est ...Federicus comes palatinus in Molendino regio vlt. Novembris Anno MDXIX (Augsburg: Sigismund Grimm und Marx Wirsung, 1520). At this point, Maximilianus seems to have already been serving as personal secretary to Charles V, as well as accompanying the monarch on his travels. As Secretary to Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, for whom Magellan had sailed, Transylvanus interviewed the survivors of the voyage when Magellan's surviving ship Victoria returned to Spain in September 1522. This group included Juan Sebastián Elcano, Francisco Albo, and Hernando de Bustamante. The result was Maximiliani Transyluani Caesaris a secretis epistola, de admirabili & novissima hispanoru in orientem navigatione, que auriae, & nulli prius accessae regiones sunt, cum ipsis etia moluccis insulis, published in Cologne in 1523. Maximilianus, a pupil of Peter Martyr Vermigli, interviewed the surviving members of the expedition when they presented themselves to the Spanish court at Valladolid in the fall of 1522. Eager to acquire fame as a writer, he produced his tract De Moluccis Insulis as a letter to Matthäus Lang von Wellenburg, the Cardinal-Archbishop of Salzburg, who had suggested that he perform the interviews in the first place. It may have also been Vermigli who suggested the project to the young courtier. Vermigli, was, after all, very interested in overseas exploration. Maximilianus' letter is dated 24 October 1522, and his account was sent to Lang, whom he calls ambiguously domine mi unice (\\"my sole lord\\"), while the cardinal-archbishop was attending the Diet of Nuremberg. This diet was concerned with pacifying the first Protestants, which resulted in the sending of a letter of appeal to Pope Adrian VI. Maximilianus' letter reached the hands of a Cologne printer, Eucharius Cervicornus (a Latinized rendering of \\"Hirtzhorn\\"), and the first edition of De Moluccis Insulis was printed in January 1523. Despite the war that had erupted between Charles V and Francis I of France (see Italian War of 1521), this first edition reached Paris, where it was printed anew by Pierre Viart in July 1523. A subsequent edition was printed at Rome by Minutius Calvus (Minizio Calvo), in November 1523. De Moluccis Insulis Transylvanus had a lively interest in Magellan's expedition around the world. However, his information should not be entirely accepted at face value, as Transylvanus uncritically accepted the testimony he took down from the surviving crew members. He was also in a hurry to get his letter published. The account written by Antonio Pigafetta, the expedition's official chronicler and one of the survivors of the voyage, did not appear until 1525, in Paris, and was not wholly published until the last year of the 18th century; this was the edition by Carlo Amoretti published in 1800. This edition is now famously called the Ambrosiana codex. It is through Transylvanus' account that Europe was informed of the first circumnavigation of the globe. Transylvanus recorded gossip on board about the mutiny that occurred during Magellan's voyage, calling it a \\"shameful and foul conspiracy\\" among the Spanish officers and men. Pigafetta and Transylvanus differ on who was responsible for the massacre that occurred at Cebu in the Philippines. Transylvanus states that it was João Serrão who mistreated Enrique de Malacca, Magellan's former slave, thereby causing Enrique to plot the massacre; Pigafetta, who did not attend the banquet that served as the trap, blames Duarte Barbosa. Transylvanus' text also includes a fairly accurate description of how spices were grown. \\"The natives share groves of this tree among themselves,\\" he writes, “just as we do vineyards.\\" A surviving copy of the first edition of his work can be found in the Beinecke Library (Yale University). A second edition can be found at the Nederlands Scheepvaartmuseum (Amsterdam). Princeton University Library has copies of the Cologne and Rome printings.

While lavishly decorated with jewels, it was deliberately too small and heavy to be worn and meant as an insult to the pope. In the painting of The Coronation of Napoleon by Jacques-Louis David, the tiara is held behind the pope by one of his aides. Design The tiara, which was of traditional papal tiara design, was designed and manufactured by Henri Auguste and Marie-Étienne Nitot of the House of Chaumet in Paris. On a central structure of white velvet there are three crowns of gold, each consisting of a large hoop surmounted with flower- work of wrought leaves, enriched with rubies, emeralds, and sapphires and surrounded with brilliants on a setting of matched and chosen pearls. In total, the tiara included 3,345 precious stones and 2,990 pearls. It cost 179,800 francs. The tiara carried in its monde the great emerald, which Pope Pius VI had removed from his tiara to pay the war reparations required by the Treaty of Tolentino in 1797. The emerald (404.5 carats) was originally part of a tiara worn by Pope Gregory XIII, which was made by Cristoforo Foppa; it displays Gregory XIII's name and coat of arms. The middle of the hoop of each crown contained a bas-relief glorifying Napoleon; they represented the re- establishment of worship (repeal of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy), the Concordat of 1801, and Napoleon's coronation. Additional plaques bore the names of Napoleon's military victories.  Thinly veiled insult At his coronation, Napoleon promised to send the pope an altar, two ornate ceremonial coaches, and a tiara. Only the tiara was delivered. Tiaras traditionally weighted between . The Napoleon Tiara, however, weighted . It was also too small to fit comfortably on a human head. Some of the jewels and decoration for this tiara came from earlier tiaras smashed and stolen by the troops of the French Directory in 1798, when General Louis-Alexandre Berthier invaded Rome, established the Roman Republic, abolished the Papal States, and exiled Pope Pius VI. His successor, Pope Pius VII elected in exile in Venice, had to use an improvised papier-mâché tiara for his coronation in 1800. The tiara was a thinly veiled insult to the pope. However, the pope thanked the emperor for the tiara by letter on June 23, 1805. He said that he intended to use the tiara for the papal mass on the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. Modifications  Originally, the middle of the hoop of each crown contained a bas-relief glorifying Napoleon; they represented the re-establishment of religious worship in France with the repeal of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, the Concordat of 1801, and Napoleon's coronation. The decorations specific to Napoleon were removed probably by Cardinal Ercole Consalvi, the Cardinal Secretary of State. They were replaced by inscriptions from Scripture (Acts 20:28 at the top, Revelation 11:4 in the middle, and Psalm 85:10 at the bottom). During the insurrection of 1831, the tiara was buried in Vatican Gardens and suffered great damage as a result. It was restored in 1834–34. The size of the tiara was adjusted so that it could be worn. It was used as the coronation tiara for a number of popes, most notably Pope Pius IX on 21 June 1846, and last worn during the First Vatican Council in 1870.

The island is long northwest-southeast, and wide, with an area of . Its shoreline measures 130 km. In 1986 it had a population of 3,035 but in 2009 it had increased to 5,200.2009 Census Summary release final - Government of Vanuatu Geology and Geography Dugong with attached remora, Lamen Island, Epi, Vanuatu. The island is of volcanic origin, and its highest point, Mount Pomare, which reaches a height of 833 m above sea level, is a quaternary volcano. It lies 13 km from the more prominent Lopévi volcano. To the east is the largely underwater East Epi volcano. The neighboring islets are Tefala, Namuka, and Lamen. On the northwest edge of the island is the sandy beach Lamen Bay, and the nearby small island of Lamen (pop. 500). The bay has some coral reefs which are the habitat of the dugong. On the west coast is Cape Forland. In the southeast is Valesdir. In the northeast is Drummond Bay, with the Nikaura Marine Protected Area, established in 2000 by the community of Nikaura. There are also black (volcanic) sand beaches, and three small freshwater lakes.  History  Epi suffered depopulation during the nineteenth century on a scale that was more massive than in many other parts of Vanuatu. There is evidence that the island was considerably more diverse linguistically than it is today. The population of the interior was relocated to coastal villages after mission contact. Culture Epi has a wide variety of languages for its size, including: Bieria in the south, Maii in the southwest, Baki in the west, Bierebo in the northwest, Lamenu at the northwest tip (and also the island of Lamen), and Lewo in the east. These languages are all spoken by a few to several hundred speakers each, and form a branch of the Austronesian languages of Vanuatu. Epi High School, at Lamen Bay, is being renovated by a joint effort from Kiwanis, Air Vanuatu, and AusAID. There is a Presbyterian hospital at Vaémali (Falmali), on the north end of the island. Economy The principal economic activity is subsistence agriculture. The island's GDP is $457 per capita. Formerly there were a number of large plantations for coconuts and copra, principally along the fertile coasts. Today most of these have been broken into small holdings, except for the large plantation at Valesdir, which continues to produce copra, beef, and kava. Other crops include peanuts (grown in the interior hills) and kava. Fishing is important as well. The government has recently been promoting training in fishing to improve its efficiency and safety. Tourism has become more important, especially in the Lamen Bay area and Valesdir. There is accommodation available in a few other places including Sara and Nikaura. Since 2007 with the introduction of the Recognised Seasonal Employer (RSE) Scheme in New Zealand, in which New Zealand horticultural businesses can source seasonal labour from several Pacific Islands including Vanuatu, a small number of New Zealand businesses have sourced their RSE labour from Epi, primarily from the Lamen Bay area. Each year between 50 and 80 workers are recruited. These workers spend up to seven months of the year in New Zealand working as seasonal labourers in the horticultural industry; returning at the end of the period with their savings. A worker on the scheme could be anticipated to save approximately 450 000 Vatu over the seven-month work period.HR Manager, Birdhurst Ltd, Motueka, New Zealand, 2009 This has provided a substantial cash injection to the local economy and improved the living conditions of many of the residents and their families. Transport There are two airports on the island, one in the northwest, Lamen Bay Airport, and one in the southwest at Valesdir. Both are serviced a five times a week by Belair and Air Vanuatu. The island can also be reached by ship. The island has basic unsealed roads but few vehicles.

The team was originally formed in 1885 at the Argyle Hotel, a summer resort in Babylon, New York. The team was so skilled in the game, and achieved victory over so many of the nearby amateur \\"white\\" teams that they attracted the attention of a promoter, Walter Cook. To appeal to a broader audience, Cook styled them the \\"Cuban Giants\\", although there were rarely (if ever) any Cubans on the Cuban Giants. The team remained one of the premier Negro league teams for nearly 20 years. The team went on to become the \\"world colored champions\\" of 1887 and 1888, and spawned imitators. History=Name Though there were no actual Cuban men on the Cuban Giants, the team had played in Cuba in the fall or winter of 1885-1886 and again in the winter of 1886–1887. In the September 1938 issue of Esquire Magazine, Sol White recounts the early days of the team: \\"…when that first team began playing away from home, they passed as foreigners—Cubans, as they finally decided—hoping to conceal the fact that they were just American Negro hotel waiters and talked a gibberish to each other on the field which, they hoped, sounded like Spanish\\" (Coover, 3). In 1896 ownership issues would lead to a new offshoot team being created, calling themselves \\"Cuban X-Giants\\". The older owner's team was then referred to as Genuine Cuban Giants or Original Cuban Giants. Ownership There are two different tales on how the Cuban Giants got their start. According to Sol White, a player who would join the Cuban Giants several years after they got started, Frank P. Thompson, a headwaiter at the Argyle Hotel in Babylon, Long Island, would regularly play baseball with the other waiters that soon became an attraction for the hotel's guests. Before long, he signed three star players from the semi-pro black team, the Philadelphia Orions, and the team went on the road to contend any team who would play them. However, according to an interview with Thompson himself published on October 15, 1887, in the \\"New York Age\\", an African- American newspaper, the majority of the ballplayers did not come from the hotel's staff, but from several other black teams. In Philadelphia, Frank P. Thompson organized the Keystone Athletics in May 1885, and in July they were transferred to Babylon, L.I. By August the Athletics had partnered with the Manhattans from Washington, D.C., and the Philadelphia Orions, and it was the coming together of these three teams that created the Cuban Giants. Walter Cook from Trenton, New Jersey was their white owner and Stanislaus Kostka Govern was their black manager. Govern, who was a native of St. Croix, Virgin Islands, understood how a team could financially prosper in the Caribbean at this time. His own team, the Manhattans, had been playing in Cuba since 1882. Thompson had a connection to Henry Flagler through Osborn D. Seavey, and once the team was through with their Cuban winter tour, they came to St. Augustine, Florida, to entertain the guests at the newly forming resort hub. The Cuban Giants would come back to Florida many times during their existence. During the St. Augustine years, Thompson put together an organization called the Progressive Association of the United States. Thompson was the president of the Association, and Govern acted as secretary. Thompson used his position to conduct annual sermons for the Cuban Giants and any citizens who wanted, to come together against prejudice in the South. These sermons were widely well received and inspired others to join him in the cause. In 1886, Walter E. Simpson bought the team and gave them a home at the Chambersburg Grounds in Trenton, New Jersey. Two months later, he would sell the team to Walter I. Cook. Cook came from a wealthy family and was generous to the team with his money, especially when it came to illness or injuries, and he is known as the Giant's most well-liked owner. They even played a benefit game for him in which they donated their pay to him. J.M. Bright purchased the Cuban Giants from Cook in June 1887. Bright was able to get them into the Middle States League in 1889, as joining a league was something the team had been trying to do for some time. However, Bright was not nearly as well-liked as Cook, and had to deal often with renegade players. This would be the team's last year in Trenton. In 1890 the entire team fled and played as the Colored Monarchs of York, Pennsylvania. In 1891, the heart of the team fled to their rival, Ambrose Davis’ Gorhams of New York City, then called the Big Gorhams. This dismantling and reassembling of the team became routine year after year until 1896, when E.B. Lamar Jr. from Brooklyn bought the team from Bright, renaming them the Cuban X-Giants. Bright responded by putting together an inferior team calling them the \\"Genuine Cuban Giants\\" or the \\"Original Cuban Giants\\". The Cuban X-Giants had a successful ten-year run as one of the best black teams in the East. Henry Flagler's role In 1885, the year of the inception of the Cuban Giants, Henry Flagler built the Ponce de Leon Hotel in St. Augustine, Florida. Many members of the Cuban Giants worked at the hotel and played exhibition games as entertainment for the patrons of the hotel (Malloy). This is a point of contention, because some people say that the Cuban Giants actually worked at the hotel and began their baseball careers as something fun to do after they got off work, and others say that they did not actually play at the hotel until their team was actually established. What is known though is that \\"playing for the wealthy clientele that frequented Flagler's empire kept the team afloat until they headed ... to ... Trenton, New Jersey\\" (Heaphy 16). Summer During their first summer season, 1886, the Cuban Giants played a game at a field in Trenton, New Jersey. At the time, Trenton did not have a hometown baseball team. The Cuban Giants gladly took the space, and Trenton became their \\"home base\\" (Malloy). Soon after moving to Trenton, a man named Walter Cook took over the job of booking games for the team. Cook also established salaries for the players (Heaphy 16). Walter Cook used the position that the player filled to determine how much they earned. The average pay for pitchers and catchers was about $18.00 per week, plus expenses. Outfielders made about $15.00 per week, and infielders made about $12.00 per week. These salaries were much more money than African Americans could have expected to make in a regular job at the time (Heaphy 16). Today, these salaries seem very low. In 2006, the minimum baseball player's salary was $380,000, while the average salary was $2,699,292 (mlbplayers.mlb.com). Winter \\"The Giants … played a number of winters in Havana, Cuba\\" (Heaphy 17). The Giants had discovered that the key to being financially stable was to play baseball all year round. Cuba was a perfect place for them to play their winter seasons, because they could avoid the cold temperatures that were common in New Jersey in the winter, and they drew huge crowds when they played in Havana. They were so popular in fact that they played \\"… in front of as many as 15,000 fans\\" (Heaphy 17). This is very impressive for the late 19th century, considering that the average attendance per game for the Philadelphia Baseball Grounds, a popular baseball venue at the time, in 1890 was 2,231 per game (baseball-statistics.com).

It is located on the southern shore of the Sognefjorden, just west of where the Aurlandsfjorden joins the Sognefjorden. Fresvik sits about south of Leikanger- Hermansverk, about east of the municipal center of Vikøyri, and about southeast of the village of Feios. The population (2001) of Fresvik is approximately 275. This village provides a starting point for hikes into the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Nærøyfjord which is south, and also to the Fresvikbreen glacier which is west of the village. Fresvik has been hosting the Fres music festival in July annually since 2005. Fresvik Church is located in the village, serving the eastern part of the municipality. Economy Agriculture is one of the main industries around Fresvik Some of the main agricultural products are fruit and berries (mainly strawberries) and there are also some lush mountain pastures for cattle or sheep. There is also the Fresvik produkt factory which produces refrigeration equipment. History Fresvik was an isolated valley community until 1976. People could only access the village by boat on the Sognefjorden. In 1976, a road from Feios to Fresvik was completed, marking the first time ever that there was a road connection to the village. Historically, Fresvik had been a part of Leikanger Municipality since the main part of Leikanger is located directly north (across the fjord). After the road was completed to Fresvik from Feios and westward into Vik Municipality, discussions began about municipal borders since Fresvik now was more easily connected to Vik rather than a boat ride across the huge Sognefjorden. As of 1 January 1992, Fresvik and its surroundings (all of Leikanger that was south of the fjord and west of the Aurlandsfjorden) were transferred to Vik Municipality. Name The village (and parish) is named after the old Fresvik farm () since the Fresvik Church was built there.

Life and military career= Early life  Ali-Agha Shikhlinski was born on April 23, 1865, in the village of Kazakhly (now Ashagy Salakhly), in Kazakh uyezd of Elisavethpol Governate. He wrote that his father, Ismayil Agha, was a member of the Shikhlinski Dynasty, an old noble family dating back to as early as 1537. Shikhlinski wrote at the \\"Officer's Notebook\\" (), a journal he has been working on since 1904, that his mother, Shah Yemen Khanum was the grandchild of Molla Vali Vidadi, an 18th-century poet.

In 1926, Shikhlinsky published the Russian-Azerbaijani Concise Military Dictionary. He resigned from military service in 1929 and wrote his memoirs, which were published in 1944.  Death  The building that Ali-Agha Shikhlinsky lived in Baku He spent his last days in his house, apartment 14 of Jafar Jabbarli Street in Baku. Prior to his death, Ali-Agha Shikhlinski wrote his memoirs \\"My Memories\\" in 1942. The book was published nine months after the general's death, in May 1944. A well-known Russian and Soviet military specialist, Doctor of Military Sciences, Major-General Evgeny Barsukov wrote a preface to the book. This book was published by \\"Azərnəşr\\" in Azerbaijani and Russian in 1984 with mass circulation (60 thousand) with additions and explanations. The funeral of Ali- Agha Shikhlinski, who died of cardiosclerosis in the hospital now named after Musa Naghiyev on August 18, 1943, and was organized by philosopher Heydar Huseynov himself. The funeral was accompanied by an orchestra from the Baku Military Garrison.Ali-Agha's wife Nigar Shikhlinskaya was the first Azerbaijani nurse  Legacy  A short biographical film named \\"The General\\", directed by Rauf Kazimovski, was released in 1970. An Azerbaijan Caspian Shipping Company tanker was named after him in 1980. There is a street in Baku and Gazakh named after him. By the decision of the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR dated July 28, 1990, the sixth cotton collective farm in Sabirabad District and 135th secondary school, located in the seventh Micro- District of Baku, was named after him. There is a memorial bass-relief on the building that he lived in. On July 23, 1990, under the decree of the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan, \\"General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski\\" scholarship was established for the students of higher education. In 1996, a descendant of the famous military commander, film director Zia Shikhlinski, made a short documentary film \\"Was considered the god of artillery\\", which was aired on November 16, 2006, in Baku, organized with the assistance of the Russian Embassy in Azerbaijan. In 2014, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on commemorating the 150th anniversary of General Ali-Agha Shikhlinski. A well-known Russian and Soviet military specialist, Doctor of Military Sciences Evgeny Barsukov wrote about him: Ali-Agha Shikhlinski was one of the characters of Russian-Soviet writer Alexander Nikolaevich Stepanov's \\"Port- Arthur\\" and \\"Zvonaryov Family\\" novels.

It is located at the end of the Lustrafjorden, a branch of the Sognefjorden. Skjolden is located at the innermost point of the Sognefjorden, Norway's longest fjord, and the length of the Sognefjorden is measured from Skjolden to the island of Ytre Sula where the fjord meets the ocean—over 200 km. The valleys of Mørkridsdal and Fortunsdal meet at Skjolden, just west of the Hurrungane mountains. Skjolden is home to about 200 people. The village is located along the Sognefjellsvegen road, about west of the lake Prestesteinsvatnet and the mountain Fannaråki. Skjolden is about northeast of the municipal center of Gaupne and about northeast of Hafslo. North of the village is Breheimen National Park, home of the glaciers Harbardsbreen and Spørteggbreen and the mountain Tverrådalskyrkja. Notable people The village was home to philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein who lived here after 1913 during some periods of his life; the longest one was 13 months. Important parts of his works were written here. He had designed a small wooden house which was erected on a remote rock over the Eidsvatnet Lake in 1913 and called “Østerrike”(Austria) by locals. It was broken up in 1958 to be rebuilt in the village. A local foundation collected donations and bought the house in 2014; it was dismantled again and re-erected at its original location; the inauguration took place on 20 June 2019 under international attendance.

Like its predecessor, EKA1, it has pre-emptive multithreading and full memory protection. The main differences are: * Real-time guarantees (each API call is quick, but more importantly, time-bound) * Multiple threads inside the kernel as well as outside * Pluggable memory models, allowing better support for later generations of ARM instruction set. * A \\"nanokernel\\" which provides the most basic OS facilities upon which other \\"personality layers\\" can be built The user-side interface of EKA2 is almost completely compatible with EKA1 -- though EKA1 has not been used since Symbian OS v8.1 (which was superseded in 2005). The main advantage of EKA2 was its ability to run full telephone signalling stacks. Previously, on Symbian phones, these had to run on a separate CPU. Such signalling stacks are extremely complex and rewriting them to work natively on Symbian OS is typically not an option. EKA2 therefore allows \\"personality layers\\" to emulate the basic primitives of other operating systems, thus allowing existing signalling stacks to run largely unchanged. Real-time guarantees are a pre-requisite of signalling stacks, and also help with multimedia tasks. However, as with any real-time operating system, a full analysis of all threads is required before any real-time guarantees can be offered to anything except the highest-priority thread. (Higher priority threads may prevent lower-priority threads from running). Any multimedia task is likely to involve graphics, storage and/or networking activity, all of which are more likely to disrupt the stream than the kernel is. Inside the kernel, EKA1 only allowed a single thread (plus a 'null' idle thread). EKA2 allows many threads. This makes it much easier to write device drivers that involve complex state machines, such as those for memory sticks or USB. Interrupts are handled with an interrupt service routine, which may request an immediate deferred function call (called as soon as the interrupts are processed), or a deferred function call, which is queued to run on a kernel thread. Either may in turn communicate with user-side threads. Power management in EKA2 was largely unchanged from EKA1. The exact scheme varies between phones, but generally the null thread puts the CPU and peripherals to sleep, after having requested a wake-up whenever the next timer is due to expire. EKA2 runs on ARM CPUs and the \\"WINS\\" emulator. (Unofficial ports exist for other CPUs). On the emulator, EKA2 provides somewhat better emulation than EKA1, in particular for the APIs which Symbian OS uses to represent processes. In EKA1 they didn't work at all on the emulator, which runs as a single Windows process. Much of the credit for EKA2 goes to a single Symbian kernel engineer, who began the project as an experiment many years before it became an official part of Symbian OS.Dennis May - United Kingdom  LinkedIn.

The word means a debased copper coin, valued at six pence Scots (equal at the time to an English half-penny), issued from the reign of James V of Scotland to the reign of William II of Scotland. They were hammered until 1677, when they were produced upon screw presses. Issues The bawbee was introduced by James V in 1538, valued at sixpence. These carry his 'I5' monogram flanking a crowned thistle, and a large saltire on the reverse with a central crown. There were also a smaller half bawbee and a quarter bawbee. Around the year 1544 James V's widow Mary of Guise minted bawbees at Stirling Castle, with an 'MR' cipher on the obverse and the cross potent with crosslets of Lorraine on the reverse. The first bawbees of Mary, Queen of Scots, issued by the mint at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh carried the cinquefoil emblems of the Regent Arran.Holmes, Nicholas, Scottish Coins, (1998), pp. 30-31, 33-4. The bawbee of King Charles II was a copper coin with the reverse inscription Nemo me impune lacessit (\\"No one provokes me with impunity\\"), although the last word on these coins was spelled \\"Lacesset\\". This motto is still in use today on the edge of some circulating one pound coins. The motto is around a crowned thistle and is followed by the date. This coin was also valued at six pence Scots or half an English penny. Etymology According to Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable, This Master of the Mint, appointed by James V, was responsible for the introduction of a silver coin valued at six, later three, pence Scots, which was named after his estate. Sillebawby was a farm in the parish of Burntisland in Fife, a moorland portion of the farm of Balbie (pronounced 'bawbee' ()). Its name takes various forms throughout its recorded history: Sybbable (1328), Slebalbe (1328 and 1458), Selybawbey (1517) are some early examples. The later examples Silverbabie (1642), Silver-baby (1654) and Silverbarton (1828 and current) may have arisen from a nickname marking the connection to the silver coin. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable also gives an alternative etymology, and states its origin from \\"French, bas billon, (debased copper money)\\", but this is a kind of speculative folk-etymology. Literary references The bawbee was metaphorically used for a fortune by Sir Alexander Boswell, the son of the more famous James Boswell, the biographer of Samuel Johnson. It occurs in the song of Jennie’s Bawbee: Sir Alexander took the hint of his song from a much older one: Brewer's Dictionary lists \\"Jenny's Bawbee\\" as meaning a \\"marriage portion\\". After 1707 the Pound Scots was phased out. England and Scotland then shared what had been the English coinage, and in Scotland the term \\"bawbee\\" took on the meaning of a halfpenny, as can be seen in the poem Lament for Ancient Edinburgh by James Ballantine published in 1856 (see Luckenbooths article). The word was still current in the 20th century and continues to be used to refer to bawbee baps or cakes in Aberdeen (i.e. low-priced baps). A popular song, \\"The Crookit Bawbee\\", was recorded by The Alexander Brothers and Kenneth McKellar amongst others, and the tune remains a staple for Scottish country dance band music. The song has a rich suitor asking why his \\"bright gowd\\" and \\"hame... in bonnie Glenshee\\" are being turned down, the lady referring to a laddie when she was a young \\"bairnie\\", and her heart \\"Was gi'en him lang-syne, for this crookit bawbee.\\" Inevitably the rich suitor turns out to be the laddie returned to his love. The bawbee is referred to in the popular Scots song \\"Coulter's Candy\\": Kirkmahoe The tale is that the people of Kirkmahoe were so poor, they could not afford to put any meat into their broth. A 'cute cobbler invested all his money in buying four sheep- shanks, and when a neighbour wanted to make mutton broth, for the payment of one halfpenny the cobbler would \\"plump\\" one of the sheep-shanks into the boiling water, and give it a \\"wallop\\" or whisk round. He then wrapped it in a cabbage-leaf and took it home. This was called a gustin bone, and was supposed to give a rich \\"gust\\" to the broth. The cobbler found his gustin bone very profitable.

This would allow passengers to travel between Long Island and New Jersey without having to switch trains; at the time, LIRR trains ran to Long Island City, where passengers took ferries across the East River to the 34th Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan. As part of the extension, the LIRR became a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad. In December 1901, because of the high cost of building a bridge, the plans were modified so that the PRR would construct the North River Tunnels under the Hudson River. The New York Tunnel Extension quickly gained opposition from the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners, who objected that they would not have jurisdiction over the new tunnels, as well as from the Interborough Rapid Transit Company, which saw the New York Tunnel Extension as a potential competitor to its as-yet- incomplete rapid transit service. The project was approved by the New York City Board of Aldermen in December 1902, on a 41-36 vote. The North and East River Tunnels were to built under the riverbed of their respective rivers. The PRR and LIRR lines would converge at New York Penn Station, an expansive Beaux-Arts edifice between 31st and 33rd Streets in Manhattan. The entire project was expected to cost over $100 million. The contract for building the East River Tunnels was awarded to S. Pearson & Son in 1903. Originally, the tunnel would have comprised two tubes, but this was later expanded to four tubes. The project was led by Chief Engineer Alfred Noble. Work began in 1904. The four tunnels were built simultaneously, digging east from Penn Station, west from Long Island City, and east and west from shafts just east of First Avenue. The tunnel technology was so innovative that in 1907 the PRR shipped an actual diameter section of the new East River Tunnels to the Jamestown Exposition in Norfolk, Virginia, to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the nearby founding of the colony at Jamestown. The same tube, with an inscription indicating that it had been displayed at the Exposition, was later installed under water and remains in use. Construction was completed on the East River tunnels on March 18, 1908.  Opening  The tubes opened along with Pennsylvania Station on September 8, 1910. As part of the New York Connecting Railroad improvement project, a connection from the East River Tunnels to the New Haven Railroad tracks was also built. New Haven trains began running through the East River Tunnels, serving Penn Station, in 1917 after the Hell Gate Bridge opened.  Later years  The East River Tunnels were flooded with of water during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Even after the tunnels were drained, corrosion continued to occur inside the tunnels, and the signal systems broke down increasingly frequently compared to before the storm. Amtrak, which owns the tunnels, originally proposed to start repairing the tunnels in 2019 at a cost of $1 billion, with each tunnel being closed for two years. However, due to delays in the East Side Access project that would give LIRR riders a second direct route into Manhattan via the 63rd Street Tunnel, Amtrak later pushed back the start date of the East River Tunnels' reconstruction to 2025, and increased the construction time to four years.  Operation  Tunnel#4 looking toward Penn Station, with both overhead wire and third rail visible The East River Tunnels are owned by Amtrak and are electrified by both third rail and overhead catenary. Diesel-powered locomotives are not allowed in the tunnels except in emergency because of ventilation concerns, so the LIRR uses DM30AC dual-mode locomotives to power a few trains from non-electrified lines into and out of Penn Station during rush hours. East of Penn Station, tracks 5–21 merge into two 3-track tunnels, which then merge into the East River Tunnels' four tracks. The tunnels end and the tracks rise to ground level east of the Queens shoreline. The four lines under the river are numbered south to north, Lines 1 and 2 running beneath 32nd Street and Lines 3 and 4 under 33rd Street. Eastward trains usually use Lines 1 and 3, and westbound usually use Lines 2 and 4. To bring the same-direction tunnels into adjacency, line 3 crosses beneath line 2 underground a few hundred feet west of the east end of the Line 2 tunnel. East River Tunnel portals in Queens :East portals for Lines 1 and 3: :East portal for Line 2: :East portal for Line 4: Approaching Harold Interlocking from the west, the four tracks are Lines 1-3-2-4 south to north (with three LIRR tracks between Lines 2 and 3, and Sunnyside Yard approach tracks scattered between the passenger tracks). East of Harold, Lines 1-3 become LIRR Main Line Tracks 4-2 south to north, while Lines 2-4 become LIRR Main Line Track 3 and the westward Port Washington main. (Harold was rearranged in 1990; until then Lines 2-4 became the westward Port Washington and the westward Hell Gate track).

It was a gathering up of the hair, after a fashion similar to the modern chignon, and sometimes called a \\"cock-up\\". Mr. Kirkton of Edinburgh, preaching against \\"cock-ups\\" – of which chignons were the representative in the mid-19th century – said: :\\"I have spent all this year preaching against the vanity of women, yet I see my own daughter in the kirk even now, with as high a 'cock-up' as any of you all.\\"  Etymology of \\"cock-up\\"  \\"Cock-up\\" is in common usage as another term for \\"foul-up\\" in British English. For example, \\"The Ministry of Defence's programme to make airworthy the eight Chinook Mk3 helicopters, which it acquired in 2001 for special operations work, has been a gold standard cock-up.\\" BBC quoting Sir Edward Leigh on the failure to timely deliver Chinook helicopters to the military. The contemporary British English usage of \\"cock-up\\" likely derives from the nautical usage of the term to describe an arrangement of the yards of a square-rigged vessel in port, and therefore likely predates the cockernonnie derivation suggested above, square-rigged vessels being in use considerably before most of the Scots references quoted here. It is possible the term has two completely unrelated origins; however, contemporary common usage is more likely to derive from the nautical term, which has an explicit association with foul-up, rather than the Scots term. Modern folk etymology has sometimes suggested that \\"cock-up\\" refers to a male erection, or to the phrase \\"cacked up\\", but this is untrue.  Etymology of \\"cockernonnie\\"  John Jamieson was of the opinion that \\"cockernonnie\\" signified a snood, or gathering of the hair in a band or fillet. Scott mentions it a couple of times in his novels. :\\"But I doubt the daughter's a silly thing: an unco cockernony she had busked up on her head at the kirk last Sunday.\\" (Old Mortality, 1816) And :\\"My gude name!

It is named after the local Member of Parliament and English Civil War commander John Hampden. In June 2011, the school became an Academy. Established as the Schools of Science and Art in 1893, it is situated on Marlow Hill to the south of the town and has a capacity of about 1,150 boys aged between 11 and 18. History=Early origins as the Schools of Science and Art: 1893–1915 In the early 1890s a fund was set up to raise money for an art and technical school in High Wycombe to help support the traditional skills in the town of cabinet making, carving and polishing. Early donations to the fund included a grant of £575 from the School of Art in Kensington Gardens and a further donation from Buckinghamshire County Council's education fund which had benefited from proceeds derived from an unpopular tax imposed on wines and spirits. To make up the shortfall needed to pay for the building the schools' trustees and general committee ran a three-day fair in the grounds of Wycombe Abbey, the home of the then Lord Carrington. The fête took place in July 1892, with Lady Carrington arriving by a special train from Paddington. The Great Western Railway also ran excursions from Maidenhead, Thame, Aylesbury and Chinnor and the revelries were led by the band of the 17th Lancers. By the end of the event the committee had raised £800.Past, Present and Future: Bucks's history documented by Muriel Pilkington. The school was originally built on 530 square yards of land in Frogmore Gardens (now known as 'Frogmoor' or 'Frogmore') purchased from Lord Carrington for £325. The building work cost £1,964 and when the school opened there was still a shortfall of £230, some of which was met by a further bazaar. The original building was designed by Arthur Vernon who also designed the RGS building and was the first man to own a car in High Wycombe. In 1901 the trustees allowed girls to be taught in separate classes and teachers and this arrangement continued until 1906 when the girls moved to buildings in Benjamin Road, ultimately becoming Wycombe High School. Courses were run at the school at all times of the day but most were in the evenings and weekends so that pupils could also work in the local furniture trade. Technical Institute and moving from Frogmoor: 1915–1966 Soon after the Schools of Science and Art opened the Frogmoor building, it became clear it was too small and a new site was discussed. In 1915 the Royal Grammar School moved to new buildings on Amersham Hill and it was suggested that the school (now usually referred to as Chepping Wycombe Science and Art Schools and Technical Institute) moved into the now vacated buildings in Easton Street (also designed by Arthur Vernon). Unfortunately the outbreak of the First World War meant that the Wycombe High School buildings were needed as a hospital so the girls moved into Easton Street and the boys had to wait. The Institute finally moved to Easton Street in 1919 and soon there was a significant expansion. Firstly the 1918 Education Act raised the school leaving age to 14 and it was decided to set up a Junior Day Technical School as part of the Institute. This would be a full-time school. At the same time the Institute set up a training school for ex-soldiers and sailors who had become disabled in the war to prepare them for the furniture trade. The Easton Street buildings also soon proved too small and were significantly expanded and a series of wooden huts were installed to be used as classrooms. The Frogmoor school continued to be used after the move to Easton Street and was finally sold in 1928 (for £3,500).Past, Present and Future by Muriel Pilkington. It has since been used for a number of different purposes including a swimming pool and is now a dentist's practice. In 1920, the Day School opened and technical classes in metalwork and woodwork were introduced - the first in the country. The schools changed their names to Wycombe Technical Institute and tuition was offered in most subjects (except French). Although the School of Art continued to be part of the Institute it was often considered a separate entity and it moved to Amersham in 1973 becoming part of Amersham and Wycombe College. In 1927 land was rented from Lord Carrington to become the school's playing fields - until then the boys had used the Rye for sports fixtures.School magazine, 1927. The boys had to change in an open fronted pavilion - close to where the present one is located - and the girls had to change behind the large roller. The school motto Quit Ye Like Men, adapted from I Corinthians 16 v13, was adopted in 1924. It remained the motto even during the co-ed period - girls were admitted in 1925 mainly to study commercial subjects. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1944, the Institute became the town's new technical school taking children at 11 and 13 plus. In 1946 it was decided to split the school and college although both still operated in the same building. By 1954, the combined school and further education centre had become vastly over-subscribed and unwieldy. Consequently, the High Wycombe College of Further Education was set up on its present site (now Bucks New University) although the final separation of pupils did not come about until 1963. In 1956 the girls transferred to the old Wycombe High School buildings in Benjamin Road to form Lady Verney High School. Lady Verney High School then moved to Wellsborne before finally merging with Wycombe High School. John Hampden and Marlow Hill: 1966–present Carved set of 12 lockers, saved from a bonfire. The boys remained at Easton Street as Wycombe Technical High School for a further 10 years before moving to the present site, the school playing fields at the top of Marlow Hill in 1966. Most of the valuable historic reminders of the early days of the Technical Institute ended up on a bonfire in the massive clearing out operation when the school moved to Marlow Hill. The only exceptions to this were the headmaster's chair, the headmaster's table, engraved with the school motto, and a carved set of 12 lockers. The lockers were designed in 1919 by Mr Shaw Wilson, head of the wood carving department and created by wounded soldiers who had returned from the war. Inscribed on the cornice are the words \\"They counted not their lives dear unto themselves.\\"Bucks Free Press, 16 May 1919. The school in 2008, before the addition of the sixth form block in 2013. The name was changed to John Hampden School in 1970 and John Hampden Grammar School in 1984. More recent developments gave the school a new façade in September 1995 and the following January work was completed on a sixth-form block to provide specialist teaching rooms, private study rooms, a common room and a new library. In 2002, funding from the Wolfson Foundation allowed a new language teaching facility and science laboratory to be opened. In 2006 a new classroom block, used mainly for mathematics teaching, and a sports hall were opened by former Arsenal goalkeeper Bob Wilson. This in turn allowed for an extension of the music department and development of a music studio. On 4 November 2010, a gas explosion occurred in the caretaker's house on the premises. In the incident, the school's caretaker was airlifted to hospital with serious burns and the school evacuated. After the explosion the school raised money for the caretaker in his recovery by means of a Mufti Day where the pupils came to school in their own clothes as opposed to the standard uniform. The Main Hall at the school On 1 June 2011 Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for Education, approved the school's application to become an Academy. Also in 2011, a food technology room was opened. A proposal was made to relocate a Synthetic Turf Pitch, which was at the time located at the Handy Cross leisure centre, to the JHGS site as part of a wider redevelopment of the leisure centre. Construction work was underway as of October 2013, and was in use by late January 2014. In 2013, an extension to the Sixth Form block incorporating a new library was built. In May 2019, a planning application was submitted for the construction of a new three storey classroom block on the front of the site. The project was initially announced in December 2018, when the school received around £3m of funding from the Department for Education's selective school expansion fund, which proved controversial. Headteachers A plaque inside the school details the leadership since 1893. There have only been six headteachers in the history of the school. The management of the original schools was vested in the trustees who in turn entrusted day-to-day control to art masters Henry Bayfield and Shaw Wilson and the Education Committee secretary WT Pycraft. The secretary was replaced by Hamilton Haddow and in 1913 by Arthur Gardham. W. J. Stamps ARCA took over from Bayfield in 1911 and he ultimately became Headmaster of the School of Art. The first headmaster (known in 1920 as Principal) of the Technical School was Mr Arthur Gardham BSc. who joined in 1913 and won the MC with the Royal Garrison Artillery during the First World War. The former army captain is remembered by old boys as a determined character who liked to get his own way. As a result of his wartime injuries he always carried a walking stick. He would hold a daily roll call on the Fives Court when he inspected hair, shoes, general tidiness. After the sudden death in post of Mr Gardham at the age of 51, the governors appointed Mr William John Davies BSc (1893-1977). Davies, an ex-army captain - he had taught at Greenwich Royal Hospital School, Dame Allan's School and Acton Technical College, where he was Senior Physics Lecturer. As the split between the School and College started in 1946, Mr Davies was both Principal of the College and Headmaster of the School. When Mr Davies was due to retire his job was split; the college job going to Mr Desmond Everett (in 1960) and Harold Ward becoming Headmaster (in 1958). He retired in 1982 and was replaced by Mr Andrew MacTavish. Mr MacTavish then retired in July 2000 and was replaced by Mr Stephen Nokes. Mr Nokes retired after 16 years in service in July 2016, replaced by Miss Tracey Hartley in September 2016, the school's first female headteacher.

It also runs international cricket, football, hockey, squash and rugby tours. In 1986 the under 18 football team won the ESFA trophy and were runners up in 1992. In 2008, the Year 9, under 14 football team won the ESFA Under 14 Schools' Cup again, beating Lancaster School from Leicester at Huish Park, the home of side Yeovil Town.

Gameplay Player wing settings Unlike most contemporaneous racing games, Revs features selection of aerodynamic settings by the player and a full three-dimensional environment. The player is allowed to drive the wrong way around the track or even away from it completely. Unusual for the time, the track and terrain are not planar, but undulations in the ground are reproduced. The game was noted for its use of the BBC's hardware in achieving its display: such was the difficulty in squeezing the game into the BBC's limited memory, part of the game code actually occupies part of the screen memory. Whilst this would ordinarily be distractingly visible, timer-based manipulation of the BBC's display palette has the effect of turning all the 'code pixels' blue, thus hiding it in the game's sky. Gameplay view from driver's seat The game features rudimentary AI for control of the opponents' cars, which are driven by individual characters with humorous names. Johnny Turbo, Max Throttle and Gloria Slap are usually the fastest opponents, whereas Miles Behind is often the slowest. Tracks The BBC Micro version release features Silverstone as its one track. There is also an expansion pack, Revs 4 Tracks (released in 1985), which adds Brands Hatch, Donington Park, Oulton Park and Snetterton to make a total of five. Reception Car showing Acorn's logo, on display at the Sinsheim Auto & Technik Museum The game was favourably received by the press for its relative realism. Acorn's marketing for the game included racing sponsorship, with driver David Hunt being sponsored in the 1984 British Formula Three Championship Acorn Computer European Trophy.

Location The Langtang Himal forms the western portion of a complex of mountains which also includes the Jugal Himal, home of Shishapangma. This complex lies between the Sun Kosi valley on the east and the Trisuli Gandaki valley on the west. Langtang Lirung lies near the Trisuli Gandaki, and north of the Langtang Khola. Notable features Though not high by the standards of major Himalayan peaks, Langtang Lirung is notable for its large vertical relief above local terrain. For example, it rises 5500m above the Trisuli Gandaki to the west in only 16 km. It has a large south face which long resisted climbing attempts. The List of the world's highest 100 mountains puts it at number 99. Climbing history Langtang Lirung The peak was reconnoitered by H. W. Tilman and P. Lloyd in 1949. Attempts were made to climb the peak via the East Ridge in the 1960s, but none got close to the summit. On 24 October 1978 two members of a japanese expedition made the first ascent of mountain via East Ridge. Poles made the first winter ascent. On January 3, 1988 Mikołaj Czyżewski, Kazimierz Kiszka and Adam Potoczek stood at the summit.Historia polskiego wspinania. Himalaje cz.III (lata 1984-88) According to the Himalayan Index, there have been 14 ascents of Langtang Lirung (in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1992, 1994, and 1995), mostly by the Southeast or Southwest Ridge routes; and 13 unsuccessful attempts on the peak (these may be underestimates). On November 9, 2009, Slovenian mountaineer Tomaž Humar, who was on a solo climb (the expedition started on October 5) via the South Face, had an accident during his descent. Sources report that he became stuck on the mountain at an approximate height of 6300 meters with a broken leg (other sources also report broken ribs and damaged spine). His only contact with the base camp staff via a satellite phone was made on the day of the accident, and he appeared to be in a critical condition. The rescue party found his body on November 14 at the height of 5600 m. Presumably, he died on November 9 or 10. Avalanche in 2015 On 25 April 2015, a massive 7.8-magnitude earthquake in Nepal resulted in a landslide on Langtang Lirung.

Description The yard is owned by Amtrak and is also used by New Jersey Transit. The shared tracks of the Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) Main Line and Amtrak's Northeast Corridor pass along the southern edge of the yard. Northeast of the yard a balloon track (or reverse loop) is used for \\"U-turning\\" Amtrak and NJ Transit trains which terminate at Penn Station. Leading eastward near the south side of the yard, this balloon track switches off and turns left under the LIRR/Amtrak tracks, turns left once again, and merges with the Sunnyside yard track to turn the train west toward Penn Station. History The Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) completed construction of the yard in 1910. At that time Sunnyside was the largest coach yard in the world, occupying 192 acres (0.78 km2) and containing 25.7 mi (41.4 km) of track. The yard served as the main train storage and service point for PRR trains serving New York City. It is connected to Pennsylvania Station in Midtown Manhattan by the East River Tunnels. The Sunnyside North Yard initially had 45 tracks with a capacity of 526 cars. The South Yard had 45 tracks with a 552 car capacity. Plans=East Side Access project Plans for the East Side Access project to Grand Central Terminal call for some LIRR trains to diverge from the main line and travel through a tunnel under the yard. The project would also create a new station at Queens Boulevard, named Sunnyside. Harold Interlocking In May 2011, a $294.7 million federal grant was awarded to address congestion at Harold Interlocking, the United States' busiest rail junction, which is part of the yard. The work will allow for dedicated tracks to the Hell Gate Line right of way for Amtrak trains arriving from or bound for New England, thus avoiding NJT and LIRR traffic. Housing development In 2017 it was announced that the city would begin a feasibility study into the construction of 21,000 to 31,000 units of housing on top of the rail yard. The project, which would be similar to the Hudson Yards development over West Side Yard, has stoked public controversy. In early 2020, Amtrak and the city government published a master plan. The plan called for building a deck over Sunnyside Yard and constructing 12,000 housing units, all of which would be affordable housing, as well as of parks and public plazas.

She was the Chief Minister of Odisha from June 1972 to December 1976. Early life Satpathy was born on 9 June 1931 and grew up in Pithapur, Cuttack, India. She was the eldest daughter of Kalindi Charan Panigrahi; Satpathy's uncle Bhagavati Charan Panigrahi founded the Odisha branch of the Communist Party of India. Political career At the age of eight (8) in year 1939 she had been mercilessly beaten up by British Police for pulling down the Union Jack as well as for pasting hand written anti British Raj posters on the walls of Cuttack. The same was widely discussed then and the same had worked as fuel in the fire for the struggle of Freedom of India from British Raj. While at Ravenshaw College pursuing her Master of Arts in Odia, she got involved with the Communist Party's student wing, the Student Federation. In 1951, a student protest movement began in Odisha against rising college education costs, it later turned into a national youth movement. Satpathy was a leader of this movement, police lathi charged the protestors and Nandini Satpathy was severely injured in the same. She was jailed, along with many others. In the jail she met Devendra Satpathy, another Student Federation member and the man who she later married. (He was later elected for two terms to the lower house from Dhenkanal . In 1962, the Congress party was dominant in Orissa; the Orissa State Legislative Assembly of 140 members had over 80 from the Congress party. At a national level, there was a movement to have more women representatives in the Indian Parliament. The Assembly elected Satpathy (then president of the Women's Forum) to the upper house of India's Parliament, where she served two terms. After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister of India in 1966, Satpathy became a Minister attached to the Prime Minister, with her specific portfolio being the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. Satpathy returned to Odisha in 1972, due to vacancies caused by Biju Patnaik and others departing from the Congress party, and became the Chief Minister of Odisha. During the Emergency of 25 June 1975 – 21 March 1977, she imprisoned a number of notable individuals, including Nabakrusna Choudhuri and Rama Devi; however, Odisha had the fewest prominent individuals jailed during the Emergency, and Satpathy otherwise attempted to resist Indira Gandhi's policies during the Emergency. Satpathy left office in December 1976. During the general election in 1977, she was part of a group of protesters led by Jagjivan Ram, which became the Congress for Democracy (CFD) party. CFD merged with Janata Party in May 1977. Nandini Satpathy was elected to Orissa Vidhan Sabha from Dhenkanal in June 1977. https://www.elections.in/orissa/assembly-constituencies/1977-election- results.html In 1980, she won that seat as Congress (Urs) candidate, and in 1985 as an independent. In 1990, her son Tathagata Satpathy won Dhenkanal assembly seat as Janata Dal candidate. Nandini Satpathy returned to the Congress party in 1989, on the request of Rajiv Gandhi. The Congress party was unpopular in Odisha as a whole, due to its two term miss rule (primarily under Janaki Ballabh Patnaik as Chief Minister). She was elected as a member of the State Legislative Assembly from Gondia, Dhenkanalhttps://dhenkanal.nic.in/public-representatives/ and remained in the Assembly until 2000, when she decided to retire from politics; she did not contest the 2000 elections. She was not influential in and was critical of the Odisha branch of the Congress party. Court Case In 1977, Satpathy was accused of corruption and a police investigation started into possible violations of the Prevention of Corruption Act in force at that time. During the investigation, she was interrogated on a number of questions in written form. She refused to answer any questions; her attorney argued that Article 20 (3) of the Indian Constitution protected her against forced self- incrimination. The court agreed, strengthening the rights of the accused with a recognition of the right to a lawyer and the right against self- incrimination; it moreover held that women have the right to be questioned at their homes in the presence of male relatives, have the right to be brought to the police station only after a formal arrest, and have the right to be searched only by other women.Nandini Satpathy v. PL Dani, (1978) 2 SCC 424 Over the next 18 years, Satpathy won all of the cases against her. Literary career Satpathy was a writer in the Odia language; her work has been translated and published into a number of other languages. She received the 1998 Sahitya Bharati Samman Award for her contributions to Oriya literature. Her last major literary work was translating Taslima Nasreen's Lajja into Oriya. Death She died on 4 August 2006 at her home in Bhubaneswar.

Their creation was funded in part by the National Lottery via the Countryside Agency. Each one is different, as local people have had an input into the design of their green. The project to create 250 Millennium Greens across the turn of the Millennium (2000/2001) was started in 1996 Description by Natural England. and ended when the last Green was handed over to its own, local charitable trust in perpetuity. Each trust now fundraises for and runs its own green, within the bounds of its trust deed, for the benefit of its local community.  Aims  The aims of Millennium Greens, as stated in their trust deeds, are as follows: * Make a substantial contribution to the life of the whole community * Be able to be enjoyed by people of all ages and physical abilities. * Be open and evident to visitors to the Locality as well as inhabitants. * Be an attractive place for people to take air and exercise, meet others and pursue leisure activities and pastimes consistent with the shared enjoyment of the whole of the land. *Include an area suitable for community events and celebrations. *Include significant \\"natural\\" areas, where people can enjoy Nature and wildlife at first hand. *Make a positive contribution to the local environment and respect the established character of the area. *Remain safely and conveniently accessible from Inhabitants' homes.  History  The project took its inspiration Follow on from Pocket Parks Page 6&7 from the Pocket Park project, started in 1984, which had successfully started the idea of communities being directly involved in the creation and maintenance of new parks. The Millennium Greens scheme was one of many UK projects funded by the Millennium Commission using National Lottery money. It was intended to form part of the permanent legacy of the celebrations of the Turn of the Millennium.  Design of the Greens  The general blueprint for the design and creation of Millennium Greens specified both green, natural areas and an area suitable for public events. In addition the Trust Deeds all specified that no buildings were to be built on the land and not more than 10% of the land should be made/left as hard areas- paving and car parks etc. Another requirement of the original sponsors was that they would not provide formal sporting grounds and play equipment, so that no pitches or playground apparatus were to be built with their funds. Every Millennium Green was to have a Feature: some kind of sculpture or other creation on the Green which could act as a focus for the creation of the Green. Various Greens have chosen something inspired by the history or geography of their locality: a statue, water feature, sun-dial etc. Many of these were unveiled at an official opening ceremony for the Green.  Creation  The Countryside Agency administered the creation of the Greens, with regional officers studying grant applications and plans, then surveying land and discussing details with local would-be trustees etc. The CA's team suffered from the fact that many of their operatives were on short-term contracts to do this work, encouraging them to look for new work elsewhere, then leave before the end of the project.  Wildlife  Because having a wildlife area is a part of the aims of creating and running a Millennium Green most Millennium Green trusts maintain an interest in the wildlife of their Greens. Most websites relating to each Green have something to say about the wildlife on their Greens and many have photos and lists of species.  Legacy  By the end of the scheme, 245 out of the planned 250 Greens were created. Whilst some lessons were learnt about creating such schemes, the Countryside Agency considered the project such a success that it launched a follow-on project to continue creating locally-run public green areas called \\"Doorstep Greens\\" in 2001. The CA's successor, Natural England has evaluated both schemes and identified some weaknesses Weeknesses Page 9 in the plans for both Pocket Parks and Millennium Greens that have made them difficult to create and maintain in perpetuity. Millennium Greens and Doorstep Greens have won numerous Green Pennant Awards. The Royal Mail celebrated the Millennium Green project in its People and Places stamps in the Millennium Collection in 2000. The Greens were intended to last in perpetuity and, as such, each was set up with a trust deed including requirements to keep the land and have it available for access by the general public. As a charitable trust their operation is controlled by the Charity Commission. Many Millennium Greens were established with formal links to other charities and official bodies. Their deeds enable them to work with commercial sponsors and indeed a number of Greens have used sponsorship to further their aims. However, as the Greens are reliant on local volunteers to keep going, including finding new trustees and fundraising, not all volunteer-run trusts have survived; a number have been changed by Natural England and the Charity Commission; usually the Local Authority ends up being the trustee of the Green. Whilst the object of the creation was for the Greens to last in perpetuity, with most of them given a 999 year lease, nevertheless, they are vulnerable to compulsory purchase if the local authority wants to change the use of the land.

Born in Burgos, Haro was based in Lisbon since 1505. After 1513, he became upset with the Portuguese crown and returned to Castile, plotting with Portuguese exiles Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy Faleiro and with the Spanish minister Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca an expedition to the Spice Islands sailing westward. As a financier and representative of the Welsers he provided a quarter of the financial backing to Magellan's 1519 voyage, which failed to conquer the Spice Islands but resulted in the first circumnavigation around the world by Juan Sebastián Elcano.

Transylvanus pointed out that Cristóbal de Haro had assisted Magellan and Faleiro considerably in presenting their proposals before the Spanish royal counselors.Tim Joyner, Magellan (Camden, Maine: International Marine, 1992), 82. Haro also helped finance subsequent Spanish expeditions to the Spice Islands: those commanded by Estevao Gomes in 1524, by Jofre de Loaysa in 1525 and by Diego García in 1528.

He has directed three films, Mekhong Full Moon Party, The Tin Mine and Seven Something (part 42.195), and was the screenwriter behind the international hit, The Iron Ladies. Biography=Early career Born in Thailand in 1961, Jira graduated in 1983 from Chulalongkorn University Faculty of Communication Arts, where he majored in film and photography. While still a student, he worked as a music video and movie commercial director. In 1991, he co-founded his own film studio, Hub Ho Hin Bangkok (later Hub Ho Hin Films). In 2003, it was merged with GMM Grammy's film division GMM Pictures and Visute Poolvoralaks' company Tai Entertainment to form GMM Tai Hub (or GTH). In 2016, he became key person for GDH 559 a film studio that successor to GTH. First features Jira started out in feature films as the screenwriter for the 2000 film, The Iron Ladies (Satree lek), which was based on a true story about a gay and transvestite (katoey) men's volleyball team that won the Thailand national championship in 1996. That film went on to be a box-office hit in Thailand and has been a popular feature at international film festivals. It was directed by Youngyooth Thongkonthun, who's gone on to direct a sequel to Iron Ladies as well as another comedy, M.A.I.D. and 2006's Metrosexual. Hit producer He was also behind the hit 2003 film, Fan Chan (My Girl), a nostalgic look at childhood in 1980s Thailand. The film's ensemble of six directors – Komgrit Treewimol, Songyos Sugmakanan, Nithiwat Tharathorn, Vijja Kojew, Vithaya Thongyuyong and Adisorn Tresirikasem – were students of Jira, who taught as a part-time professor in photography and cinematography classes at Chulalongkorn University. Two of those directors, Komgrit and Songyos, went on to direct hit films, Komgrit helming the romantic comedy Dear Dakanda in 2005 and Songyos with the hit 2006 thriller Dek hor (Dorm). Jira's second directorial effort, The Tin Mine was a lavish production about a tin mine in southern Thailand in the 1950s. It was based on the short stories of Thai author Archin Panjabhan, who served as an adviser on the production. The film fared poorly at the Thai box office, but it has won several awards and has been featured at international film festivals.

It includes the eastern portions of King and Pierce counties and crosses the Cascade mountains to include Chelan and Kittitas counties. The district's western part includes the exurban communities of Sammamish, Issaquah, and Auburn but does not include Seattle and Tacoma's more immediate suburbs (with the exception of eastern Kent in the district's western-most corner). On its east side, the 8th's population centers include the rural communities Wenatchee, Leavenworth, and Ellensburg. It is currently represented in the U.S. House of Representatives by Democrat Kim Schrier, who was first elected to the seat in 2018. Creation The 8th district was created after the 1980 U.S. Census. For its first 30 years, it was centered on the Eastside region of the Seattle metropolitan area. After the 2010 U.S. Census, the state responded to population changes by shifting much of the Eastside to the 9th District. To make up for the loss in population, areas east of the Cascades were shifted to the 8th District. For the first 35 years of its existence, the district was held by a Republican. At the same time, the 8th district has voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since 1992. Prior to the 2011 redistricting, the district had the peculiarity of having a Democratic advantage according to its Cook PVI, but only having elected Republicans to Congress throughout its history. After the district was pushed into the Cascades with the 2010 redistricting, its PVI is now even. The GOP winning streak ended with the 2018 election. thumb Recent history=2004 In 2004, Dave Reichert, at the time serving as the sheriff of King County, beat his Democratic opponent Dave Ross by 52% to 48% in the race to replace 12-year incumbent Jennifer Dunn; that year, voters in the district favored Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. 2006 Responding to Reichert's perceived vulnerability, former Microsoft program manager Darcy Burner (D) challenged Rep. Reichert in 2006, in what was widely expected to be a close election. Influential election analyst Charlie Cook listed the contest among 68 competitive or potentially competitive House races to watch in 2006, categorizing it as a \\"toss-up\\" (defined as \\"the most competitive; Either party has a good chance of winning\\").Cook, Charlie. \\"2006 competitive House race chart.\\" The Cook Political Report, October 11, 2006.

This time, Reichert defeated Burner 53 percent to 47 percent, a solid victory despite Barack Obama's 15-point margin in the district. 2010 In the 2010 election, Reichert and Democrat Suzan DelBene advanced out of the Washington State Top 2 Primaries with 47.2% and 26.9% of the vote, respectively. Reichert prevailed over DelBene in the General Election 52.1% to 47.9%. In this election, Reichert won both King and Pierce counties even after losing some key endorsements, including the Seattle Times, which endorsed Suzan DelBene and Tim Dillon in the primaries. 2012 In the 2012 election, Reichert ran against Democrat Karen Porterfield, Associate Dean and Public Administration Lecturer at Seattle University. James Windle of Snoqualmie Pass also ran against Reichert as an independent candidate, but dropped out of the race in August 2012. 2014 In the 2014 election, Reichert defeated Democrat Jason Ritchie, a small business owner from Issaquah. 2016 In the 2016 election, Reichert defeated Democrat Tony Ventrella, a former sportscaster. Ventrella did not think he would beat the other candidates in the field and dropped out in July 2016 only to finish second overall and restart his campaign in the general election. 2018 Reichert announced in September 2017 that he would not seek re-election. Former State Senator and gubernatorial nominee Dino Rossi advanced from the top-two primary alongside pediatrician Kim Schrier. In the general election, Schrier defeated Rossi with 53 percent of the vote to become the first Democrat to represent the district.  Election results from statewide races  { class=wikitable - !

He is a professor of philosophy at Elmhurst University. Training William Hirstein received his Ph.D. in philosophy at the University of California, Davis under the direction of Richard Wollheim.UC Davis Philosophy Department PhDs He then did post-doctoral work under the supervision of Patricia Churchland and Vilayanur S. Ramachandran at the University of California, San Diego, exploring neurological syndromes that lead to confabulation, such as in split-brain patients, and patients with anosognosia or Capgras delusion. Theory of confabulation Hirstein draws heavily on the interaction between his philosophical training and his clinical experience in his 2005 book Brain Fiction to develop a comprehensive epistemic theory of the neural basis of confabulation, and argues that prefrontal executive processes fail to correct false memories or perceptions, resulting in a confabulation. Thus confabulation is a result of two errors, which may be caused by two separate brain lesions. First there is an error in memory or perception, and second, prefrontal executive processes fail to correct the error. Mindmelding hypothesis Mindmelding hypothesis. In his 2012 book, Mindmelding: Consciousness, Neuroscience, and the Mind's Privacy, Hirstein argues that a significant block to solving the mind–body problem can be removed if we allow that it is possible for one person to directly experience the conscious mind of another. The vast majority of philosophers and scientists writing about consciousness believe that this is impossible, but this would mean that conscious brain states are different from all other physical states, which can be known about by multiple persons. This creates a block to understanding our minds as physical systems. Hirstein describes how \\"mindmelding\\" could be achieved by connecting person A's prefrontal lobes to person B's posterior cortex, which would in effect connect person A's sense of self to person B's conscious thoughts and sensations.

Punk Mary is Walford's original wild child. She often makes life difficult for herself due to her stubborn, defensive nature and she tends to feel that everyone around her is out to get her. In fact, Mary is her own worst enemy and most of her misfortune is down to her irresponsible behaviour and her inability to heed good advice. Davidson's return to the soap for a single episode was announced in December 2018. She returns for the funeral of Doctor Legg (Leonard Fenton) in episode 5871, originally broadcast on 19 February 2019. Storylines Mary arrives in Walford in March 1985 when she is housed in Reg Cox's (Johnnie Clayton) old council flat (23b Albert Square), following his death, bringing her daughter, Annie Smith. Mary had been touring with a punk group when she got pregnant and moved to London to escape her overbearing family who viewed Mary's choice of lifestyle with contempt. Single mother Mary finds bringing her daughter up extremely difficult. She has little money and virtually no experience, and her inability to listen to anyone's advice means that she often makes mistakes with her daughter's welfare. This is compounded by the fact that Mary is illiterate; Annie is nearly harmed when Mary gives her the wrong dosage of medication. Mary is an incredibly irresponsible mother and almost everyone on the Square has a turn at looking after Annie at one time or another. Most take pity on Mary and are willing to help her out, which she regularly uses to her advantage. Mary makes an unlikely friendship with local busybody, Dot Cotton (June Brown), who will regularly be put upon to babysit for baby Annie whilst Mary goes out to party or earns cash. Although Dot likes to preach to Mary, she is one of the few people that Mary listens to on Albert Square. Strapped for cash, Mary finds it difficult to provide for Annie, so her friend Sheena Mennell (Dulice Liecier) talks her into becoming a stripper and she regularly dances for married shopkeeper Saeed Jeffery (Andrew Johnson). One night when Mary is out stripping, she leaves Annie in the care of Sheena. Sheena then leaves Annie alone while she goes out with a client. Mary's neighbour, Sue Osman (Sandy Ratcliff), finds Annie before any harm can come to her, but Mary subsequently cuts all ties with Sheena. In February 1986, nurse Andy O'Brien (Ross Davidson) tries to help Mary by teaching her to read. However, Mary falls in love with him so she stops stripping and drops her punk image to impress him. Andy is forced to reject her advances, and an angst-ridden Mary spitefully informs him that she will not be attending any more of his reading lessons. The following day her punk image is back. However, without her stripping job, she is now penniless again. Nick Cotton (John Altman), seeing her in a desperate state, tries to coax her into becoming a prostitute. Mary declines, but her desperation for money makes her question whether it would be such a bad idea after all. Luckily, Andy manages to put a stop to this by getting her a job working in a hospital canteen. Mary later has a relationship with the married Mehmet Osman (Haluk Bilginer), but he is only using her to win a bet with his brother Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih). After months of chasing, Mehmet finally manages to have sex with Mary, and he triumphantly claims his winnings from his brother. However, Mary witnesses his gloating and she furiously vows to get revenge. After sabotaging his car, she proceeds to make regular crank calls to his cab firm. Things then get worse for Mary when she quits her job at the canteen after she is promoted but afraid to admit that she cannot read. Once again she finds herself desperate for money. By December 1986, Mary is persuaded to turn to prostitution by Pat Wicks (Pam St. Clement), who is being pimped by Mehmet. By early 1987, Mary has flung herself wholeheartedly into prostitution, much to the concern of everyone on the Square. Pat has a change of heart and starts refusing to give Mary any more contacts, so Mary decides that she will find her contacts on her own. She starts making regular trips to Central London and comes home late one night covered in bruises and blood. Initially, Mary claims that she had been beaten by the Walford attacker — a man who had assaulted several other women in the area — but she later confesses that she had been beaten by other prostitutes for trying to poach their clients. Despite this, Mary refuses to stop prostituting herself, even when the healthcare worker, Carmel Roberts (Judith Jacob), warns her that her baby might be taken away from her if she continues. Mary is furious and rampages around to find out who had reported her to Carmel. An anonymous letter from Dot Cotton puts Sue in the frame, and this leads to Mary viciously attacking Sue in the café one night. Mary is later arrested for soliciting, which leaves her with a large fine. However, even this doesn't stop her prostituting herself. Mary's unsocial hours mean that she is often forced to leave baby Annie alone at night whilst she goes out to work the streets. This culminates in Annie nearly dying in a fire one night when she is left alone. Luckily for Mary, she is rescued by Arthur Fowler (Bill Treacher) before she is harmed. Dot can no longer stand the maltreatment of Annie so she contacts Mary's parents, Chris Smith (Allan O'Keefe) and Edie Smith (Eileen O'Brien), who arrive in Walford and demand to take Annie back with them to Stockport. Mary initially refuses, but she eventually realises that her burnt-out flat is no place for a baby, so she begrudgingly allows Annie to go. In 1987, Mary begins a relationship with Rod Norman (Christopher McHallem); a good-hearted, scruffy, layabout who has a soft-spot for women in distress. Rod is a good influence on Mary and desperately tries to get her to stop prostituting herself, regain control of her life. Rod is also instrumental in helping Mary regain custody of Annie. However, Social Services are now involved, as Mary's mother decides to apply for full custody of Annie. Mary is frequently frustrated by the amount of time it is taking for Social Services to decide who should have custody of Annie, but Rod keeps her going and even manages to get her a job as cleaner in The Dagmar winebar. Still, Edie refuses to give Annie back, so Rod tries a different tactic. He phones Chris and tells him that Mary is threatening to kill herself unless she gets her baby. The lie works and by the end of the year, Mary's father arrives on the Square bringing baby Annie back to an overjoyed Mary. Chris desperately tries to convince Mary to return to Stockport with him for a family Christmas. She refuses, but on Christmas Eve, after getting extremely drunk, Chris snatches baby Annie and attempts to drive her back to Stockport with him, only to crash his car into a garden wall before he can leave. Annie survives, but Mary finds it hard to forgive her father for his near-fatal mistake. In 1988, Mary and Rod begin to go through some problems, which eventually lead to them splitting up. Mary begins to behave erratically again, regularly taking drugs and begging around the Square for money to fund her habit. She begins to neglect Annie again and even dumps her on Sue while she disappears for a week without informing anyone she is going. She becomes an unwitting pawn in Simon Wicks's (Nick Berry) game to bed as many women as possible and is later hurt when he cruelly rejects her. Her father tries desperately to help her regain control of her life, giving her a job as receptionist at his new haulage company. However, upon the arrival of her mother, Edie, Mary decides she is sick of her family's interference, and after vandalising her father's business with paint, she takes Annie, jumps on a bus and leaves Walford, sticking up two fingers in the air as she goes. Over thirty years later, Mary and Annie (now played by Marilyn O'Brien) return for the funeral of Doctor Legg (Leonard Fenton), where they reunite with old friends, Dot, Lofty Holloway (Tom Watt), Sharon Mitchell (Letitia Dean), and Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth). They reminisce and Mary thanks Dot for her help with Annie as a child, before leaving.  Creation and development  Mary Smith was one of the original twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mary's original character outline as written by Smith and Holland appeared in an abridged form in their book, EastEnders: The Inside Story. :\\"Aged 19. Mary was brought up in Stockport. Her parents were Irish Catholics...Her father is a long-distance lorry driver....When she left school Mary could hardly read or write, she didn't learn because she didn't want to...She gave no trouble, no aggro, but no-one took any notice of her...Her mother nagged her about her soul...At 15 she went to a gig with a crowd of people from school and in one night her life changed...She fell in love with a band, a man and a culture. She had found her own religion...She became pregnant...Semi-literate, unskilled and at the same time ashamed...She couldn't go back to the oppressive society of her childhood, where everybody judged everybody and where she would be labelled, even by her own mother, as a 'loose woman'...She wouldn't have an abortion...She drifted into our area, and became one of the single parent families that congregate there...Will she be a survivor, or a loser?...Over the months she may develop a fear of authority...Maybe she will be forced to drift into a life of prostitution...\\" (page 56). As Holland and Smith wanted a diverse cross-section from the East End community, it was decided that one of the main cast had to be a young, single mother, and as punk music was prominent in British culture at the time, they decided to use a punk image for the character. Holland and Smith decided to cast an unknown actress in the role. They chose Linda Davidson, who was the right age and had been brought up in northern England and therefore had an accent that would befit the character's background. However, actress Jenna Russell revealed in 2016 that the part was originally offered to her, saying, \\"I was asked to play Mary Smith in the show right in the beginning when it started in 1985, but I was very young and it wasn't the right fit for me then\\". Mary was one of the most striking of the original characters: a lone mother with a small baby, who hid herself under punk makeup, was unable to read or write and was a northerner alone in a southern city. One of the most controversial storylines the character was involved in was her dalliance with prostitution in 1987, although it did earn the programme a considerable amount of negative press at the time and was accused of promoting a negative association between single mothers and prostitution. The character of Mary lasted in the show for three years, and was eventually written out of the series when Linda Davidson decided to leave in order pursue other acting roles. On-screen, Mary leaves Walford the way she arrives, running away from her parents. Davidson reprised the role for one episode in 2019 for the funeral of Doctor Legg. Mary and Lofty's return was confirmed by the BBC on 18 December. The characters return for the funeral of original character Doctor Legg (Leonard Fenton), who returned to the soap in 2018. Mary appears in one episode broadcast in 2019. Executive consultant John Yorke invited Davidson to reprise the role and described Mary as a \\"huge iconic characters, and a central part of the show's DNA\\". He added that he was excited to have the characters return for one episode where they play \\"small but incredibly important roles\\". Davidson expressed her delight at reprising the role and said she was \\"so thrilled, and very proud\\" to return to the soap. She commented, \\"EastEnders was my first proper family. It gave me stability and a fantastic foundation from which to build an incredible life.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:EastEnders characters Category:Fictional prostitutes Category:Television characters introduced in 1985 Category:Female characters in television Category:Fictional erotic dancers ","title":"Mary Smith (EastEnders)"},{"id":"4425057","text":"The Babylon Rail Road was a horsecar line in Babylon Village, New York, later converted to a trolley line.

He earned an Academy Award nomination for collaborating on the screenplay to the 1935 film The Lives of a Bengal Lancer. Biography The Argosy in 1918  Self-written early biography  Achmed Abdullah's biography prior to coming to the US is based on his own writings and interviews, and his reminiscences in The Cat had Nine Lives, and is not verified by independent sources. As was frequent among new immigrants to the US in 1910–20s, Achmed Abdullah claimed descent from the Russian imperial family. He famously stated he was born Alexander Nicholayevitch Romanoff in 1881 in Yalta, Russia, to Grand Duke Nicholas Romanoff, a (non-existent) cousin of Czar Nicholas Romanoff and Princess Nourmahal Durani, a daughter of an Amir of Afghanistan. After his mother's attempts to poison her husband due to his multiple affairs, they divorced, leaving their son and two other children to their maternal grandparents. At the age of 12, he was sent to Eton and then to Oxford University to be educated (there are no records about him in either school). He claimed that although he was born Russian Orthodox, he was raised as a Muslim by his uncle who adopted him.Edward E. Curtis, Encyclopedia of Muslim-American History, Facts on File, Inc., 2010, pg. 198 Abdullah claimed that he himself was a devout Catholic. Upon his graduation, he said he joined the British Army and rose to rank of acting colonel during his 17-year military career. He claimed to have served in Afghanistan, Tibet in 1903-04 with the Younghusband Expedition. He was also deployed in Africa, China, and also with the British-Indian army in India. In addition, he was also a colonel in a cavalry regiment for one year in the Turkish army as a British spy. He claimed to have mostly spent the time in the military as a spy because of his wide knowledge of Oriental and Middle Eastern customs and religions. It is said that he traveled widely in Russia, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and China and spoke many languages and dialects. He claimed he was made a British citizen by an Act of Parliament and convicted by the Germans during the First World War for being a spy. USA In the 1910s he emigrated to the United States and eventually became a writer and playwright, and later on, a Hollywood screenwriter. Abdullah's work appeared in several US magazines, including Argosy, All-Story Magazine, Munsey's Magazine and Blue Book.Darrell Schweitzer, \\"Introduction\\" to Fear and Other Tales From the Pulps, Wildside Press, 2005, (pp. 7-8).

Achmed Abdullah married at least three times: to Irene Bainbridge, Jean Wick, and Rosemary A. Dolan. He was the father of two daughters with Irene Bainbridge: Phyllis Abdullah (who died in childhood) and Pamelia Susan Abdullah Brower.

Fed by retreating glaciers, it drained south through the Chicago Outlet River.  Origin  The city of Chicago lies in a broad plain which, hundreds of millions of years ago, was a great interior basin covered by warm, shallow seas. These seas covered portions of North America from the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Evidence of these seas are found in the fossils of coral, such as those unearthed in Illinois quarries at Stony Island Avenue, Thornton Quarry, and McCook, Illinois , or at 18th Street and Damen Avenue in Chicago. Evidence may also be found in the fossils in the Niagara limestone bedrock found throughout the Chicago area and extending all the way to Niagara, New York. Much later, the polar ice cap crept four times down across the continent, covering the region with ice to a depth of a mile (1500 m) or more. As the climate changed, the ice melted, the last great ice flow (the Wisconsin Glacier of the Pleistocene period, which covered much of northern half of North America) retreated, and an outlet for the melting water developed through the Sag River and the Des Plaines River Valley around Mt. Forest, in the area known as the Palos. The Kankakee Torrent poured through those valleys, eventually leaving behind the prehistoric Lake Chicago, the ancestor of Lake Michigan. Chronology 13,000 to 11,000 years before present The earliest formation of Lake Chicago occurred when the Michigan Lobe of the glacier retreated northward into the basin of modern Lake Michigan, ca 13,000 years ago.Bulletin 4, The GLACIAL LAKES around Michigan; William R. Farrand, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan; 1988 The edge of the retreating glacier formed moraines, the Park Moraine in present-day Illinois and the Lake Borders Moraine in Indiana and Michigan.The Illinois Ice Lobe; Frank Leverett; U.S. Geological Survey, Monograph, #38; Government Printing Office; Washington, D.C.; 1899, Plates 14, 16, 53 Early Lake Chicago at the edge of the ice sheet Map of Glacial lakes Whittlesey, Sagniaw and Chicago, based on the USGS Report of 1915 The ice continued northward forming the next phase of Lake Chicago. The lake level remained at 640' above sea level, but the ice margin was a third of the way north, opening a channel across Michigan, draining the Lake Saginaw and Lake Whittlesey proglacial lakes in the Lake Huron and Lake Erie basins. Map of Glacial Lakes Duluth, Chicago, and Lundy (USGS 1915) When the ice retreated northward enough to open the Mohawk River valley, the waters in the Lake Huron and Lake Erie basin diverted from the Michigan outlet, leaving Lake Chicago as a headwaters lake. Continued northward migration of the glacier, set the stage for the next major proglacial lakes in the Lake Michigan basin as Lake Algonquin and then Nipissing Great Lakes.  Size  Extending somewhat further south, west and east than Lake Michigan, Lake Chicago extended west to present day La Grange, Illinois and south beyond Homewood and Lansing, Illinois, completely covering what is now Northwest Indiana, including the cities of Hammond and Gary, Indiana. As the Wisconsin Glacier continued to retreat, it created new outlets for the water in Lake Chicago, including Niagara Falls, and the St. Lawrence River. As these outlets were developed, a partial lake capture occurred and the water level in Lake Chicago began to drop in three observable stages of 15 to 20 feet (5–6 m) each. Eventually even the outlet to the southwest dried up, and the Des Plaines River overflowed into the basin that became Lake Michigan. Outlet and beaches  As the Michigan Lobe of the Labradorean Ice Cap retreated northward, the area of Lake Chicago increased.Publication 9. Geological Series 7; Surface Geology and Agricultural Conditions of the Southern Peninsula of Michigan; Frank Leverett with a Chapter on Climate by C. F. Schneider; Michigan Geological and Biological Survey Lansing Michigan; 1911 Lake Chicago’s initial outlet was to the southwest through the Des Plaines River valley, thence down the Illinois River to the Gulf of Mexico. The highest beach is the Glenwood Shoreline, which is to above the level of Lake Michigan. There are two additional beaches formed when the Des Plaines outlet was abandoned for other outlets to the north and east: the Calumet Shoreline, about to above the current lake, and the Tolleston Beach to above Lake Michigan. The name Lake Chicago is used for the lake when it drains through the Des Plaines outlet. The Calumet and Tolleston Beach lake is Lake Algonquin. The outlet channel is more than a wide and cuts through glacial deposits. Near the head of the channel, rock layers have been cut through. It is probable that the distinct beaches from Lake Chicago are the result of these rock layers' giving way rapidly, dropping the lake level from higher to lower levels. After each stage, the next barrier remained solid, holding the lake stable and creating distinct beaches. If the outlet were formed by a steady erosion of the barrier, it would have been less likely that the well defined beaches would have been created. Along the eastern shore of Lake Michigan, the beaches of Lake Chicago have been destroyed by erosion, except the highest beach. Much of this beach has also been destroyed. The best remaining segments are along the southern tip of Lake Michigan in Indiana. Lake bed deposits Lake Chicago covered only a narrow strip of land on the south and east side of modern Lake Michigan. From Holland northward across the Lake Chicago, the lake bed extends 10 to 25 miles (16 to 40 km) inland. The widest expanse is almost entirely fine sand. There is more sand than clay in a narrow strip along the shore. The clayey portions have till at only a few inches depth. The offshore winds along the east shore of Lake Michigan have created sand dunes, burying the older glacial beaches and lake beds.  Today  Stages of development of the Great Lakes. Vast amounts of sand in spits, dunes and beach lines--particularly at the southern tip of Lake Michigan--were left behind by each of the three stages of lake level drop. Today, evidence of these vast sand deposits is still clearly visible. Northern Indiana, for example, contains the Indiana Dunes, and many of the Chicago area's trails and roads follow some of these ancient beach lines or ridges in the sand spits. For example, Ridge Road from Homewood, Illinois, through Thornton and Lansing, Illinois, and then crossing the state border into Munster and Highland, Indiana, is one; Michigan City Road through Riverdale, Dolton, and Calumet City, Illinois, is another; LaGrange Road is another; Riverside Drive in Riverside; Ridgeland Avenue in Oak Park, or Grosse Point Road, Carpenter Road, and Ridge Avenue (The Rosehill Spit) in the Rogers Park/West Ridge neighborhood of Chicago, north of Devon Avenue and continuing north through Evanston, Illinois, are some others. Blue Island, Illinois, and Stony Island were, literally, islands left behind as Lake Chicago's water level fell.

Dunlop, Russia confronts Chechnya: roots of a separatist conflict, 1998) before failing out with him after a year-and-half during the 1993 Chechen constitutional crisis. After a bloody two-day clash between his followers and allies, including Chechen mafia boss Nikolay Suleimanov, and Dudayev's loyalists in the centre of the Chechen capital Grozny on June 13–14, Labazanov fled the city and promptly declared a blood feud against Dudayev for the death of his relative (either a brother or a cousin), whose head was publicly displayed among the heads of three other Labazanov's henchmen.Mirosław Kuleba, Niezłomna Czeczenia, 1997Tracey C.

In the summer of 1994, Chechnya descended into a fierce civil war-style conflict between the Chechen government and the opposition forces. For the first two months the clashes were sporadic, but on September 4, Dudayev's forces attacked Labazanov's stronghold of Argun and after a fierce all-night battle during which dozens of fighters were killed on both sides succeeded in dislodging him out of the city. The fighting culminated in the November 26 attempted raid on Grozny by the Chechen opposition supported by the covert Russian federal forces, which resulted in the final defeat for the Provisional Council and the open intervention by Moscow. During the subsequent First Chechen War of 1994-1996, Labazanov sided with the invading Russian federal forces and promptly was given the rank of colonel in the Russian internal security service FSK (soon to be reorganized into the FSB).Robert Seely, Russo-Chechen conflict, 1800-2000: A Deadly Embrace, 2001The Search for Peace in Chechnya: A Sourcebook 1994-1996, John F.

It is located in Ottadalen, at the southern end of Lalmsvatnet, and has a population of 316. The name In the Middle Ages the place was known as Ladalm. The name is a reference to the fact that winter hay and feed for animals was stored there. History From early in the Middle Ages Lalm was established as an early industrial center. Millstone production Written sources indicate that in the 15th century there was millstone production at Lalm, although it is possible the production dates back to the Viking era. From Kvennberget—which translates roughly to the mill-hill—millstones were delivered around Norway and even internationally. Kvennberget gained protected status as a cultural treasure in 1987. Until 1640 Tolstad and Kvennberget were krongods. Anyone was free to produce as many millstones as they could as long as the land owner received every fourth millstone as payment. Starting in the 1830s this business was popular for farmers as winter work. The population increased greatly during this time and it was difficult for the population to subsist on farming. The business in Kvennberget lasted until the end of the 1870s. After the Østerdalsbanen railroad was built, millstones from Selbu took over the millstone market in eastern Norway. At the same time iron was produced from bog ore to supply tools for the millstone production. Near Melingen there are indications of iron production. Also in the area around Mela there was pottery production since the area has a good supply of clay. Soapstone production About a century ago the production of soapstone began at the farm Baarstad. Baarstad became a large employer for the surrounding area and the production lasted about a century until the soapstone supply was exhausted. During the 1850s the roads in the district were improved and in 1896 the railroad was extended to Otta. This resulted in improved conditions for the soapstone business. In 1896 Norsk Kleber- og Skiferforretning was established and several other firms followed soon thereafter. The firms produced soapstone products as well as talcum. At the height of the activity in the business a steel mill was built by Østlandske Stenexport in the 1920s in Otta. The building was later converted to the Otta Dairy. Gradually the soapstone production declined until it reached the current level. There is still limited production of soapstone for wood stoves and fireplaces. A/S Granit still produces wood stoves and fireplaces. The soapstone was until the fall of 1995 extracted mostly from Åsårberget, but the company is now extracting soapstone from both Bårstad and Nyseterberget. Electricity production On the southside of Ottaelva by the Eidefossen waterfall is A/S Eidefoss hydroelectric powerplant. The powerplant has produced electricity since 1917. The business was established in 1916 and the year after electricity production commenced. In 1920 a second generator was added and from then on the powerplant produced about 10 gigawatt-hours of electricity annually. The first electricity production was transmitted to a power line from Vågåmo to Otta. In 1983 a repowered plant began production after an investment of 72 million Norwegian kroner. Currently the Eidefossen powerplant produces 72 gigawatt-hours annually. The powerplant is owned jointly by the five neighboring counties: Lesja, Dovre, Sel, Vågå og Lom eier A/S Eidefoss. Each county owns 20% of the shares in the company. Culture Lalm community center opened in 1958 and is a gathering point for the surrounding community. The center hosts cultural events and is the home of the local marching band Lalm Musikkforening and the local youth brass band Lalm Ungdomsbrass. Sports and recreation Lalm athletic club was founded in 1936 and today has over 200 members. Lalm has an athletic center for football and track and field as well as a lit running and ski path and a small downhill ski area.

Her father was a Scotsman and her mother was American, from Mobile, Alabama. Due to an inheritance left to her by her late mother, she can work for a nominal fee. She lives alone in a large ageing house in Merchiston in Edinburgh. Isabel is \\"a good person, a kind soul. She’s very thoughtful, obviously.\\"http://www.sarahweinman.com/confessions/2004/10/the_idiosyncrat.html However, she often lets her personal feelings about various issues get in the way of more rational judgement. *Cat, Isabel's niece, is a young attractive woman who runs a delicatessen in the Bruntsfield neighborhood of Edinburgh. Cat has a habit of falling for inappropriate men and refusing to listen to Isabel's advice about them. *Grace, Isabel's housekeeper, an outspoken Scotswoman with an interest in spiritualism and an opinion on everything. *Jamie, Cat's ex-boyfriend who is a \\"fatally attractive\\" bassoonist.

Particular comparisons have been made between McCall's Edinburgh and the version of the city that appears in Ian Rankin’s books. McCall Smith notes that his books are \\"certainly a bit different from the very realistic fiction that comes from Edinburgh\\" but believes that both styles equally reflect the nature of Edinburgh and Scotland: \\"I would say that a city’s literary nature needn’t be carved in stone. One doesn’t need to accept that there is just one sort of literature or one formula for the Scottish novel.\\"http://www.bookslut.com/features/2005_10_006827.php Style In comparison to The No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, the Sunday Philosophy Club series is \\"a little bit more tilted in the mystery direction.\\" Nonetheless, it is a detective novel \\"only in a rather quirky, incidental way.\\" More importantly, the series is character- rather than plot-driven. Time Out’s website describes the main character Isabel thus: \\"If you combine the nosey interfering of Austen’s Emma with the relentless self-analysis of Carrie Bradshaw you have a fair idea of the protagonist.\\"http://www.timeout.com/london/books/review/book/218/the_right_attitude_to_rain_by_alexander_mccall_smith.html The books are mostly narrated through Isabel's eyes from a limited third- person viewpoint. McCall Smith himself calls the series \\"a little more focused\\" than The No 1 Ladies’ Detective Agency, with \\"a different register.\\" Nonetheless, he believes that Precious Ramotswe and Isabel would get along: \\"[Mma Ramotswe] would respect [Isabel] but she would probably tell her to relax a bit, drink a bit more tea, and sit out under a tree to chew the fat a bit more.\\" The repeated presence of a female protagonist who tries to do the right thing demonstrates McCall Smith's \\"underlying sympathy for women and fundamental generosity of spirit.\\" Themes and issues The series deals widely with \\"everyday moral and philosophical conundrums\\" through Isabel's work as the editor of a philosophical journal. McCall Smith notes: \\"We can't necessarily answer the great questions about meaning – Camus talks about this, that you can't answer the question of what is the meaning of life, but you can find meaning in a limited context, and work toward that.\\" A key element is the notion that simplicity and kindness are important aspects of life: \\"Kindness needn't be dull ... it can also be elevating and moving.\\" Commenting on the lack of villains in his ‘mystery’ stories, McCall Smith explains: \\"I don't do baddies very well.\\" Ultimately, the books examine \\"the fundamental question of how we can lead a good and satisfying life.\\"http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/books/article/0,1299,DRMN_63_4093167,00.html The series frequently makes references to works of literature from Scotland and elsewhere. Often-mentioned is W. H. Auden, McCall Smith's favourite poet,http://www.itsallwrite.net/aspbite/categories/index.asp?intCatID=686 whose \\"marvellously humane\\" poetry is \\"a constant inspiration\\".http://www.churchtimes.co.uk/content.asp?id=31604 Jamie, Isabel's love interest, has been given McCall Smith's favourite name.

Born as Norman Ackland Bernstein in Southend, Essex, to a Jewish father from Warsaw and a non-Jewish mother,William D. Rubinstein, Michael Jolles, Hilary L. Rubinstein, The Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, Palgrave Macmillan (2011), p. 13 he was educated at Balham Grammar School in London. In his 16th year he made his first stage appearance at the Gate Theatre Studio, playing Medvedieff in Gorky's The Lower Depths and later studied acting at the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art. He married Mab Lonsdale, daughter of the playwright Frederick Lonsdale, in 1952; she died in 1972. Theatre career In 1929, after performing with various repertory companies, he toured as Young Woodley in the play of that name. At the Gaiety Theatre in 1933 he played Paul in his own adaptation of Ballerina, which also toured the following year, and at the Criterion in 1936 he played the role of Oliver Nashwick in his own original play After October which transferred there from the Arts Theatre. In 1941, he co-wrote the screenplay for the film Temptation Harbour starring Robert Newton and Simone Simon. Two musical collaborations came in 1942 with his version of Blossom Time starring Richard Tauber as Franz Schubert at the Lyric Theatre, and his London Coliseum production of the musical play, The Belle of New York. He also wrote and directed The Dark River at the Whitehall Theatre in 1943, starring Peggy Ashcroft. He joined Robert Newton as co-authors of Cupid and Mars (1945), and A Multitude of Sins (1951) The first staging of his large-cast drama, The Pink Room (or The Escapists), in Brighton and then at the Lyric Hammersmith in London on 18 June 1952, was largely financed by Terence Rattigan, who liked the play and believed it deserved a London production. The Pink Room was a tragi-comedy set in the summer of 1945 in a seedy London club (based on the French Club in Soho).The Oxford Companion to English Literature, 6th Edition. Edited by Margaret Drabble, Oxford University Press, 2000 Pp 4 It received a severe critical panning and after that, apart from one further play and an adaptation, it led to a 40-year near-silence from the playwright. According to its director, Frith Banbury, \\"When the play failed, Terry never wanted to see Rodney again.\\" However, following the abolition of the Lord Chamberlain's licensing and censorship functions in 1968, there was a growing permissiveness about what could be presented on the stage, and in the 1980s, while ailing with leukaemia, Ackland rewrote aspects of this play, re-titling it Absolute Hell. It was put on in its new form in 1988 to considerable success at the Orange Tree Theatre, Richmond-upon-Thames, directed by Sam Walters and John Gardyne, and starring Polly Hemingway and David Rintoul. In 1991 it was adapted and directed for BBC Television by Anthony Page, starring Dame Judi Dench, and the play was revived by Page at the Royal National Theatre in 1995, again with Dench in the leading role. In 2018 the National staged another revival, directed by Joe Hill-Gibbins and starring Kate Fleetwood. See also Nick Smurthwaite's theatre profile of Ackland for The Stage, Revival of a Realist, 5 February 2004 Film career Rodney Ackland's first contact with Alfred Hitchcock was as a supporting actor in the 1931 screen version of John Galsworthy's play The Skin Game. But a year later Hitchcock recognised his potential as a screenwriter, collaborating with him on the second film adaptation of J Jefferson Farjeon's London fog-bound thriller Number Seventeen starring Leon M Lion. Ackland co-wrote the popular British film Bank Holiday (1938), contributed additional dialogue to Young Man's Fancy (1940), and made some uncredited contributions to 1941's Dangerous Moonlight and 1944's Love Story. His screenplay for Hatter's Castle in 1941, from the novel by A.J. Cronin, provided a rampant star role for Robert Newton as the megalomaniac Scottish hatter. In 1942 he shared with Emeric Pressburger an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay of 49th Parallel, starring Raymond Massey and Eric Portman, (released in the United States as The Invaders). Ackland is credited with discovering British-American actress Sally Ann Howes, the child of neighbour Bobby Howes, when he insisted that she audition for his 1943 film Thursday's Child, which he both wrote and directed. He renewed his association with Pressburger in 1946 with a screenplay for the stagey, now forgotten thriller Wanted for Murder, mainly as a film vehicle for the talents of Eric Portman playing a man obsessed by his father's role as the public hangman. In the same year he made the first adaptation of Georges Simenon's novel Newhaven/Dieppe, directed by Lance Comfort, with another overwrought performance by Robert Newton, set against swirling studio fog. He twice collaborated with Rattigan as a movie scriptwriter: in 1942 for Anthony Asquith's Uncensored, starring Eric Portman; and again — but neither he nor Rattigan were credited — for the 1948 Associated British production of Bond Street, four stories in one, about a wedding trousseau. His final work for the cinema was on the screenplay of an adaptation of Alexander Pushkin's The Queen of Spades. Ackland intended to direct the film, but fell out with the producer Anatole de Grunwald and star Anton Walbrook. Thorold Dickinson took over at short notice and rewrote Ackland's script with the help of de Grunwald. Assisted by a co-author Elspeth Grant, Ackland wrote his memoirs, The Celluloid Mistress, or The Custard Pie of Dr. Caligari, published by Alan Wingate in London in 1954.

The story is known as Realistic Fiction because of the untrue life story of Mattie Gokey, the real death of Grace Brown, and the events that could take place in the 1900s. Set in northern Herkimer County, New York in 1906, it is based on the murder of Grace Brown case —the basis also for An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser (1925). It features a girl -the narrator-, who gets caught up in the events. In the U.K., Bloomsbury published an edition within the calendar year, entitled A Gathering Light, and Donnelly won the 2003 Carnegie Medal, recognizing the year's outstanding book by a British author for children or young adults.\\"The Carnegie Medal: Recent Winners\\" . CILIP. Retrieved 2008-02-02. For the 70th anniversary of the Medal a few years later it was named one of the top ten winning works, selected by a panel to compose the ballot for a public election of the all-time favourite.  Nonfiction element  Jennifer Donnelly intertwines this real-life murder of Grace Brown with fictional Mattie Gokey's story. The readers get a taste of how bitter and sweet ordinary life is in the 1900s, mixed with a non-fiction murder mystery.\\"Editorial Reviews: Amazon.com Review\\". Jennifer Lindsay. Amazon.com. Retrieved 2010-03-19.  Plot summary  The novel centers on a feisty and smart sixteen-year-old narrator Mathilda \\"Mattie\\" Gokey with strong morals. The novel takes place in the Adirondack Mountains of northern New York (the \\"North Woods\\") during 1906. Mattie dreams of going to Barnard College in New York City. While smart enough to go, her father does not allow her: there is no one to work on the farm except Mattie and her three younger sisters, Abby, Lou, and Beth. Her mother died and her brother Lawton left home because of a fight with their father.Donnelly, p. 25. Mattie is passionate about reading and writing; she looks up a new word in her dictionary so that she can educate herself.Donnelly, p. 38. Her best friend, Weaver Smith, is also intelligent and has large aspirations. Weaver is African-American and is as strong in math as Mattie is in literature. Weaver shows Mattie's writings to their teacher, Miss Wilcox, who sends an application for Mattie to Barnard College . Mattie gets \\"full scholarship\\" to BarnardDonnelly, p. 64. but she knows she can't afford to buy the books and a train ticket, or to leave her family's farm. Mattie soon finds out that Miss Wilcox clandestinely writes feminist poetry, which is unwelcome in the world of literature. She writes about the lack of rights for women,Donnelly, p. 205. which is a sensitive subject at the turn of the century. Many people think poorly of her, but she keeps writing, encouraging Mattie to do the same. Mattie doesn't give up completely on going to college. Mother had made her promise to pursue knowledge, and Mattie intends to. She cleans her rich and nosy Aunt Josie's house every week and tries to ask her for money, but Aunt Josie tells Mattie she is being selfish to try and leave the farm and the family, like her brother Lawton. Aunt Josie refuses to give Mattie money. Mattie, a romantic, is jealous of her friend, Minnie's, loving relationship with her husband Jim. Later on in the novel, Mattie helps Minnie give birth to her twins. The novel is written in alternating chapters from the past and present. In the past, Mattie explains her life on the farm; in the present she works at The Glenmore, a hotel on Big Moose Lake, to earn money during the summer. The body of Grace Brown is found in the lake near the hotel.Donnelly, p. 1. Earlier that day, Grace had asked Mattie to burn a pack of letters.Donnelly, p. 42. Mattie didn't have time to burn them. She is drawn in by the mystery of what they might say, and she begins to read them. They reveal some shocking information about Grace's lover, Chester Gillette, who checked into the hotel as Carl Grahm. Grace was pregnant with Chester's child at the time,Donnelly, p. 216. so he killed her. Royal Loomis is also a major part of this story. He has recently developed a crush on Mattie, but she can't figure out why. She thinks she is plain, bookish, and too smart for her own good. Even though Mattie knows she likes Royal, she continues to push him away because she doesn't think he likes her for the right reasons. Despite the rejection, it draws Royal even closer. Still young and naive, Royal's continuous advances make Mattie nervous, but she can't resist. She compares Royal to the characters in books she reads, and makes herself think that he is as heroic as the literary characters. He tries to connect with her by giving her a book for her seventeenth birthday. Unfortunately, he gives her a cookbook, which is a backhanded gift that shows he wants her to be just like other girls. Mattie is more confused than ever with Royal's insincere advances. Unfortunately, all of the mixed feelings that she has for Royal end up being pointless because, in the end, he only likes her because he wanted to get a part of her land.Donnelly, p. 327. Emmie Hubbard is Mattie's lonely, poor, and depressed neighbor who has seven children. Emmie is having an affair with a married man, Frank Loomis (Royal's father). Royal resents the Hubbards because he thinks his father treats them better than his own family. After Weaver's house is set on fire by the same people that attacked him while he was running an errand at the train station and all of his saved college money is stolen, Emmie steps up and invites Weaver's mother, Aleeta, to stay with her in her home. Now Emmie has a good, strong-willed woman to clean her up and help her with a business to make money. Weaver's mother has a place to stay where she is needed. In the end, Mattie makes the incredibly difficult choice to leave the North Woods and go to school in New York City.Donnelly, p. 375. She leaves in the morning, and the only person she tells is Weaver. She writes three letters, one to her father, one to Royal, and one to Weaver's mother. To her father, she leaves two dollars and a promise that she will keep in touch. To Royal she leaves the ring that he gave to her when he proposed. Finally, to Weaver's mother she leaves just enough money to pay off Emmie's taxes. She also gives Weaver money for a train ticket to college. As her closest friend, Weaver does not want her to leave but he understands that she is going to make a better life for herself. Though she feels incredibly guilty for leaving, she can't help but also feel excited, scared, and willing. She has made her peace with Grace because she decided to show the letters to the world so now every one can see the true, tragic story of Grace Brown.Donnelly, p. 377. She is now ready to leave it behind, and keep her life in the North Woods as a memory. Major characters * Mattie Gokey: age 16 (she later turns 17), the eldest daughter of a widower farmer, who earns a college scholarship and really wants to become a writer. Mattie states that she is good at telling herself lies, and other characters comment she often seems oblivious to the events going on around her. Mattie believes that she is not courageous like Weaver or Miss Wilcox, but eventually finds the courage to go to New York. * Emily Baxter/Wilcox: is an unconventional poet who has written poems controversial enough that they have been burned and condemned by the highest authorities. Her husband, who does not approve of Emily's poetry, tries to get her committed and eventually, she flees to Paris. Under the name of Miss Wilcox, she acts as a teacher and friend to the main character, Mattie. She also helps Mattie achieve her dream of going to college. * Weaver Smith: is the only black boy in the entire area and Mattie's best friend. He worked at the Glenmore Hotel along with Mattie in order to earn money for the train ticket to New York City, where he would attend Columbia University. Weaver is often a source of inspiration and exasperation to Mattie, and they both share a love of books, making Weaver frustrated by Mattie's affections for the inarticulate Royal Loomis. * Royal Loomis: is a handsome but dull boy who Mattie and many other girls are sweet on. Although he doesn't understand Mattie's love for books and words, after spending some time together, he asks to marry her and she says yes. Mattie, however, returns the ring later on after she decides to go to New York City. Royal harbours bitterness toward Emmie Hubbard and her children, as his father treats Emmie better than he does his wife. In the end, he only liked Mattie because of the possibility of getting her land. * Minnie Compeau: is Mattie's best girl-friend. She's pregnant with twins, who Mattie helps deliver later on in the plot. Minnie is married to Jim Compeau and they are very much in love, in comparison to Mattie's uncertainty towards Royal. * Abby, Lou and Beth: are Mattie's three sisters. Beth is the youngest, aged 5, is described to be a noisy, boisterous little girl. Mattie states in the book that she knows Beth will grow up to be 'truly beautiful' someday. Lou is the middle sister, aged 11, and is very wild and tomboyish. Before the death of their mother and their brother Lawton leaving, Lou was very close to their father, and is hurt by the sudden distance between them. She is the only girl out of the four sisters to have her father's blue eyes and black hair, which she shares with Lawton, their brother. Lou frequently cuts her hair out of anger and to suit her boyish attitude. Abby, the second oldest, is 14 and described as being kind but somewhat introverted. She is also a better cook then Mattie is. Mattie, Abby and Beth all have brown hair and eyes, like their mother. Mattie's sisters are another reason why Mattie is torn between going to New York and staying to look after them. * Emmie Hubbard: is a widow whose farm lies between the Loomis' and the Gokeys. Emmie is considered to be 'the village fruitcake'. She has several children, but most of them have different fathers. Tommy, one of her eldest, is very close to Mattie; she considers him a little brother. Emmie's children often go to their neighbors to beg food off them. When Weaver's mother is attacked near the end of the novel, however, Emmie reforms and repays her kindness by taking care of her. As a result, Emmie's home situation improves and her children begin to help with the farming, being unable to previously due to Emmie's frequently unstable moods. The Loomis family dislikes the Hubbards. * Aunt Josie: Mattie's rich, stuck up aunt. No matter what Mattie does she cannot please her. * Table 6: The perverted man at the hotel who indecently exposes himself to the waitresses. * Cook: The chief at Glenmore. She is pushy, but cares about the waiters. * Jim Compeau: Minnie's husband. He loves Minnie and their twins. * Mr. Baxter: Miss Wilcox's husband who doesn't approve of her \\"free\\" writing style. * Mr. Frank Loomis: Father of Royal and his brothers, who is cheating on his wife with Emmie. * Mrs. Iva Loomis: The stuck-up mother of Royal and his brothers. Mattie says she understands why Mr. Loomis is cheating on her. * Grace Brown: The body that shows up in Big Moose Lake. A girl who is killed by Chester Gillette and was pregnant with his child. * Chester Gillette \\"Carl Grahm\\": Grace Brown's murderer. He kills Grace by hitting her with a tennis racket to render her unconscious and drowns her in Big Moose Lake by tipping their boat over. No one suspects that it was him. * Pa (Michael Gokey): The father of Mattie, Lawton, Lou, Beth, and Abby. He is bitter and depressed from the loss of their mother. His French name is Michel Gauthier. He was beaten by his step father and still has many scars to prove it. * Lawton Gokey: The eldest of the Gokey family children. After getting in an argument with Pa, he left and hasn't been seen since. * Aleeta Smith: Weaver's mother. Loving and kind, she supports Weaver's wanting to go to Columbia. * Uncle Fifty: Mattie's uncle who is an alcoholic but is very kind. Sometimes he promises false things while he is drunk, and he travels around the world as a French river man who visits the Gokey family very rarely. He always brings great presents for every member in the family. He promises Mattie money for college but goes back on this promise and spends the money on alcohol and pleasure.

Laodicea was one of the five cities built by Seleucus I Nicator and named after his mother Laodice. Its surname () is derived by Straboxii. pp. 576, 579, xiii. pp. 626, 628, 637. (from the volcanic nature of the surrounding country), but HamiltonResearches, ii. p. 194. asserts that there is not a particle of volcanic or igneous rock in the neighbourhood, and it may be added that, if such were the case, the town would rather have been called, in Greek, Laodikeia tês katakekaumenês. The most probable solution undoubtedly is that the town was at one time destroyed by fire, and that on being rebuilt it received the distinguishing surname. It was situated to the northwest of Iconium (now Konya), on the high road leading from the west coast to Melitene on the Euphrates. Some ancient authors describe it as situated in LycaoniaStephanus of Byzantium s. v.; Strabo xiv. p. 663. and others as a town of Pisidia,Socrates, Hist. Eccl. vi. 18; Hierocles p. 672. and Ptolemyv. 4. § 10. places it in Galatia, but this discrepancy is easily explained by recollecting that the territories just mentioned were often extended or reduced in extent, so that at one time the town belonged to Lycaonia, while at another it formed part of Pisidia. Its foundation is not mentioned by any ancient writer. Laodicea is at Ladik, and numerous fragments of ancient architecture and sculpture have been found. Visitors in the 19th century described seeing inscribed marbles, altars, columns, capitals, friezes, and cornices dispersed throughout the streets and among the houses and burying grounds. From this it would appear that Laodicea must once have been a very considerable town. It was restored by Claudius and received the name Claudiolaodicea. There are a few imperial coins of Laodicea, belonging to the reigns of Titus and Domitian.Sestini, Mon. Ant. p. 95 ; comp. Droysen, Gesch. des Hellen. i. p. 663, foll.

The cells in the lower frame are under the action of WIN 55,212-2. They are thought to assume a more \\"quiescent\\" phenotype. From Michalski et al., 2008. WIN 55,212-2 is a chemical described as an aminoalkylindole derivative, which produces effects similar to those of cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) but has an entirely different chemical structure. WIN 55,212-2 is a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist that has been found to be a potent analgesic in a rat model of neuropathic pain. It activates p42 and p44 MAP kinase via receptor-mediated signaling. At 5 μM WIN 55,212-2 inhibits ATP production in sperm in a CB1 receptor-dependent fashion. WIN 55,212-2, along with HU-210 and JWH-133, may prevent the inflammation caused by amyloid beta proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This anti- inflammatory action is induced through agonist action at cannabinoid receptors, which prevents microglial activation that elicits the inflammation. Additionally, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglial activation in rat models. WIN 55,212-2 is a full agonist at the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (Ki = 1.9 nM) and has much higher affinity than THC (Ki = 41 nM) for this receptor. WIN 55,212-2 is also an agonist of the PPARα and PPARγ nuclear receptors. WIN 55,212-2 reduces voluntary wheel running in laboratory mice, but with effects that depend on both genetic background and sex. In the United States, all CB1 receptor agonists of the 3-(1-naphthoyl)indole class such as WIN 55,212-2 are Schedule I Controlled Substances. WIN 55,212-2 is illegal in the UK.

He was the son and successor of Nicomedes II of Bithynia. Life Memnon of Heraclea wrote that Nicomedes IV was the son of Nicomedes III with his wife NysaMemnon, History of Heracleia 22.5 but according to Granius Licinianus, Nicomedes IV was his son by an earlier wife called Aristonica who died nine days after he sons birth. He then married Nysa, the daughter of Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia and, Laodice of Cappadocia, the sister of Mithridates V of Pontus. Both Nicomedes III and Nysa shared a lineage from the Seleucid dynasty of the Seleucid Empire.Gabelko,O.L. The Dynastic History of the Hellenistic Monarchies of Asia Minor He and Nysa likely had a daughter also named Nysa.McGing, The foreign policy of Mithridates VI Eupator, King of Pontus p. 143 Nicomedes also had another son, Socrates Chrestus, from a concubine called Hagne who was from Cyzicus. He sent Socrates and Hagne to Cyzicus with 500 talents.Granius Licinianus, History of Rome, 29 His third wife was Laodice of Cappadocia, his former mother-in-law. Nicomedes and Mithridates VI of Pontus made an alliance. The latter invaded Paphlagonia and drove its ruler, who descended from Pylaemenes, out.Orosius , History against the pagans 6.2.2 The two kings partitioned it among themselves.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 37.4.2Festus, Summary of the history of Rome, 11.1 Mithridates VI had Ariarathes VI of Cappadocia (the husband of Laodice and father of Nysa) murdered by a certain Gordius in 116 BC. Afterwards he decided to remove (i.e. murder) the young sons of Ariarathes VI and Laodice as he thought that his gains from the murder, the control of Cappadocia, might be lost if they would turn against him. However, Nicomedes invaded Cappadocia \\"while it was left defenceless by the death of its sovereign.\\" Mithridates VI sent assistance to his sister “on pretence of affection for her, to enable her to drive Nicomedes out of Cappadocia.” However, Laodice made an agreement to marry Nicomedes . An angry Mithridates drove Nicomedes out and restored Ariarathes VII, the son of Laodice. After this he murdered Ariarathes VII of Cappadocia and installed his son on the Cappadocian throne as Ariarathes IX under the guardianship of Gordius.Justin, Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 38.1 In 100 BC, after the murder of Ariarathes VII the Cappadocians revolted against Mithridates VI and called his for brother, Ariarathes VIII of Cappadocia, who was in Pergamon for his education, to return to Cappadocia to become king. Mithridates invaded Cappadocia and drove him out. Ariarathes VIII died in 96 BC. With his death his dynasty died out. Nicomedes III now feared that Mithridates would invade Bithynia. He pretended that Laodice had a third son from him and instructed a young man to apply for the throne of Bithynia (or, more likely, the Cappadocian throne, see note) from the Roman senate. He sent Laodice to Rome to testify that he was Nicomedes' son. When Mithridates heard about this, he sent Gordius to Rome to legitimise his enthronement of Ariarathes IX in Cappadocia by claiming this man was a descendant of Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, who had been an ally of Rome and who died in 130 BC when he supported Rome in a war against Eumenes III of Pergamon. The senate saw the scheming by both kings. It ordered Mithridates to leave Cappadocia and, \\"to console him\\", also ordered Nicomedes III to leave Paphlagonia.Justin: Epitome of Pompeius Trogus' Philippic Histories, 38.2 The text of a decree issued in 102 B.C by the city of Delphi has survived. It concerned the assignment of tasks for thirty slaves which king Nicomedes and queen Laodice provided when the city sent delegates to them to ask them for slaves. The decree also made arrangements for honouring Nicomedes and Laodice. It provided for the erection of a statue of the king and one of queen in the most prominent place in the temple of Pythian Apollo and for the grant to the two monarchs and their descendants of proxeny, priority of access to the oracle of Delphi and in receiving justice, tax exemption, privileged seating at the city's games and other privileges that were given to other proxenoi and benefactors of the city who were given same rights as its citizens, except for public office, and free trade in the city.OGIS: 345 Diodorus Siculus wrote that when Nicomedes III was asked to provide troops for the consul Gaius Marius during the Cimbrian War with the Cimbri and Teutones in Gallia Transalpina in 104 BC, he turned down the request, saying in his reply that \\"most of the Bithynians had been taken away as slaves by the tax-collectors, and were dispersed throughout the provinces.\\" The Roman senate acted on this information and decreed that \\"no freeman belonging to any of the Roman allies should in any province be forced to be a slave, and that the praetors should take care to see that they were all set free.\\"Diodorus Siculus,Library of History, 36.3.1-2 NotesReferencesSources ; Primary sources *Diodorus Siculus, Library of History, v. 12, books 33-40 (Loeb Classical Library), Loeb, 1989; *Granius Licinianus, Grani Liciniani Quae Supersunt (Classic Reprint),Forgotten Books, 2018; *Festus, Eutropius: Festus, Eutropii, Sext.

Biography Born in Bangalore, India, Dossetor attended Marlborough College in Wiltshire before receiving a B.M. and B.Ch. from St John's College, Oxford in 1950. In 1955, he immigrated to Canada to accept a position at McGill University. In 1958, he co-ordinated the first kidney transplant. From 1960 to 1969, he worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital. In 1960, he joined the University of Alberta as a professor of medicine, director of the Division of Nephrology and Immunology and co–director of the Medical Research Council, Transplantation Research Unit of the University of Alberta Hospital. From 1985 to 1996, he was the Director of the Bioethics Centre in the Faculty of Medicine (later named the John Dossetor Health Ethics Centre). He was a co-founder of the Kidney Foundation of Canada. In 1994, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was awarded the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal. Dossetor died in Ottawa, Ontario on 6 April 2020 at the age of 94. Medical ethics In his 2005 book Beyond the Hippocratic Oath: A Memoir on the Rise of Modern Medical Ethics, Dossetor describes his oversight of skin graft experiments in Igloolik for the International Biological Program in the early 1970s. Dossetor describes his reaction to reading an account of the experiment from one of the test subjects years later, and his disturbed realization with hindsight that the consent process for this research, which had depended on \\"group consent from community elders\\" granted via a non-Inuk translator, had been \\"inadequate in that subjects...did not understand what was going on\\". He ultimately concludes in the book that his team did not do enough to secure meaningful consent, and expresses his concern that a careful, fully informed consent process is \\"still not considered crucially important even in research today\\". In 2019, several Inuit from Igloolik spoke out about the skin grafts and other medical experiments conducted on them without consent in the 1960s and 1970s and initiated legal action against the Government of Canada.

The seminary was originally created to prepare candidates for Lutheran ministry in Western Canada. It is supported by the four Western synods of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. LTS provides training for pastors and diaconal ministers; offers Lutheran formation for leaders and laypeople; and advances the study of rural ministry. History In 1913 the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Manitoba and Other Provinces founded the Lutheran College and Seminary (LCS), which finally settled on 8th Street in Saskatoon in 1915. In 1939 the Norwegian Lutheran Church in America established the Luther Theological Seminary, first on the campus of the Lutheran College and Seminary and then, in 1946, on a separate campus in Saskatoon, on Wiggins Avenue. For almost twenty years, Lutherans in Western Canada maintained two theological schools. A merger occurred in 1968, joining the two organization into the present Lutheran Theological Seminary Saskatoon, with a faculty of six and a student body of thirty. In 1968 the school moved to the University of Saskatchewan campus and into close proximity of ESC (The College of Emmanuel and St. Chad) and SAC (St. Andrew's College). Even at this early stage, the training was ecumenical; students registered in one school were free to take classes toward their degrees in the other two schools. In the same year, an arrangement was reached with the Central Pentecostal College, now Horizon College and Seminary. In 1969 LTS, ESC and SAC established a Graduate School of Theology which would later be known as the Saskatoon Theological Union. In the late 80s, LTS introduced a non-ordination Master of Theological Studies (MTS) Program and a graduate-level Master of Pastoral Counseling (MPC). When the ELCIC approved the diaconal ministry roster, the Seminary began to develop a program to address the academic needs of these students. The seminary, in conjunction with the ELCIC’s Candidate Committees and the national Program Committee for Leadership in Ministry (PCLM), helps coordinate the recruitment and discernment process for candidates for pastoral leadership.

The airport land was originally a military rifle range. In 1918 the Royal Flying Corps began using the field behind the range for experimental mail flights, and the Ottawa/Rockcliffe Airport opened officially in 1920 as the Ottawa Air Station, one of the six original airfields opened across Canada by the new Air Board.

Part of the wood engraving, Totentanz (1538), by Hans Holbein the Younger, showing the clearing of a forest to create farmland. The clearing of woods and forests is the process by which vegetation, such as trees and bushes, together with their roots are permanently removed. The main aim of this process is to clear areas of forest, woodland or scrub in order to use the soil for another purpose, such as pasture land, arable farming, human settlement or the construction of roads or railways.  Description  One definition of forest clearing is given in the Austrian federal law that governs the forestry industry which defines it as \\"the use of forest land for purposes other than forestry\\".Rodung, Federal Law dated 3 July 1975, that governs forestry, \\"Forstgesetz 1975\\", Austria), retrieved 19 June 2014. Sometimes a distinction is made between forest clearing or tree clearing, whereby the trees, including the stumps, are cleared, and stump or root clearing where the trees are first felled and the stumps removed subsequently. Forest clearings may result in small, isolated, treeless areas or cleared corridors, for example along rivers or other linear features. Isolated clearings frequently occur in advance of more general and large-scale deforestation. Many towns and villages in Central Europe emerged during historical \\"clearance periods\\" resulting in \\"clearing or clearance landscapes as a form of internal colonisation. An example of this is the settlement of people in the Central Uplands in so- called Waldhufendorf villages. The names of many towns and villages in Europe derives from their origin as clearance settlements, for example, names ending in -rode (Gernrode, Wernigerode) or -reuth (Bayreuth).

After drafting their friends Lyle Hein (bass, vocals) and Morgan Stanton (percussion, vocals), the group set out to play a one-off gig for a friend's St. Patrick's Day party. They took their name from \\"Donegal Express,\\" a song by Shane MacGowan and The Popes. They received such an enthusiastic response at their first show that they decided to take their act to some local pubs, most notably Mick O'Shea's in downtown Baltimore. After adding Skye Sadowski (fiddle) and Laura Hein (keyboards), the group released their first album, Whiskey Bars A-Go-Go, in 1999. In 2000, they released their second album, Quinn's Diaries. The album went on to receive numerous positive reviews, and was named Album of the Year by the Irish Voice, beating out the likes of Sinéad O'Connor and U2.

With a land area of it is the largest island in Tafea Province, the southernmost of Vanuatu's six administrative regions. Name The endonym for Erromango in Erromangan is Nelocompne. There are several accounts of how 'Erromango' came into common usage: firstly, an oral history from the Potnarvin area tells of how Captain James Cook was given a yam during his visit in August 1774, and was told in the (now-extinct) Sorung language armai n'go, armai n'go ('this food is good'), and mistakenly assumed this to be the name of the island. A second account is related by the naturalist Georg Forster, who accompanied Cook. He writes that he learned the name 'Irromanga' from a man named Fannòko, while visiting the neighbouring island of Tanna five days later. Cook himself does not name the island in his account of his visit, but writes later that he got the name, which he spells as 'Erromango', from Forster. History=Prehistory Erromango was first settled by humans around 3,000 years ago, as part of the Lapita migration out of south-east Asia into island Melanesia. The Lapita people brought with them domestic animals such as pigs and chickens and food plants such as yam and breadfruit.Walter & Lebot 2006, p. 118. Two sites on Erromango, Ifo and Ponamla, have yielded significant archaeological evidence of habitation by Lapita and post-Lapita peoples, including pottery sherds, adzes, marine shell artifacts and cooking stones. Erromango contains numerous caves that provided refuge from tribal warfare and cyclones. Human use of these caves has been dated to 2,800-2,400 years before present. Some of the caves contain rock art and petroglyphs that have been identified with clan motifs and traditional stories. Caves were also used as burial sites. European contact James Cook was the first European to land on Erromango, landing near present-day Potnarvin in the north-east on 4 August 1774. Cook and his landing party were set upon by a group of local men, and in the scuffle that followed, several of Cook's men were injured and a number of Erromangans killed. Following this incident, Cook gave the name 'Traitor's head' to the peninsula adjacent to Potnarvin.Cook 1890, p. 503. Whaling vessels were among the early regular visitors to the island on the nineteenth century. The first such vessel known to have visited was the Rose in 1804 and the last on record was the American vessel John & Winthrop in 1887.Langdon, Robert (1984) Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century, Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.190. The sandalwood trade In 1825, trader and adventurer Peter Dillon discovered the island's large reserves of sandalwood (Santalum austrocaledonicum), valued in China for its aromatic oil and as a carving wood. Dillon found that his trade goods were not sufficient to entice Erromangans to cut the timber for him, so he left without gathering any sandalwood. News of his discovery brought other outsiders to Erromango to exploit the resource, and this caused conflict between the Erromangans and the traders.Dillon, letter to the editor, Bengal Herkaru, 14 October 1826, cited in Dorothy Shineberg, They Came for Sandalwood, Ch. 2 Beginnings of the Trade, University of Queensland Press 1967. In 1830, King Kamehameha III of Hawaii sent two ships with 479 Hawaiians on board to seize control of Erromango and its sandalwood, under the command of Boki, ruler-designate of Erromango. Their arrival in Cook's Bay coincided with the arrival of two other groups of traders intent on exploiting the sandalwood; two ships, the Dhaule and the Sophia, both crewed by 330 Rotuman labourers and another ship, the Snapper, with a crew of 113 Tongan labourers on board, had all arrived just before the Hawaiian vessels. The Erromangans resisted the Hawaiians' takeover attempt, and the Hawaiians' hostile intent turned the Erromangans against the other interlopers and their Polynesian crews. Fever killed most of the Tongan and Hawaiian labourers, and just 20 Hawaiians returned to Hawaii to tell the story of their failed occupation. A crash in the price of sandalwood shortly after deterred most traders until the mid-1840s, but even when prices rose again, the combined risks of attack on shore, uncharted reefs, storms and hurricanes meant that sandalwood trading was a highly speculative venture. Some traders such as Robert Towns and James Paddon established stations on Erromango or nearby islands such as Aneityum and Île des Pins in New Caledonia to reduce their costs. By 1865 though, Erromango's sandalwood resource was exhausted.Shineberg 1967, Ch. 11. Introduced diseases and depopulation Erromango's population prior to European contact is estimated at approximately 5,000, though some estimates are as high as 20,000. European visitors brought diseases such as influenza, smallpox and measles to which the local population had no immunity. Sixty percent of Erromangans died during a smallpox outbreak in 1853 and a measles epidemic in 1861.Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.90. Contemporary accounts by missionaries blamed the sandalwood traders for the outbreaks.Paton, John G., Missionary to the New Hebrides: An Autobiography (1889; reprint; Ross-shire, Great Britain: Christian Focus, 2009), pp. 111-114, 123. Erromangans sought reprisal by killing European and Polynesian missionaries (e.g. George N. Gordon), their converts and other visitors.Shineberg 1967, pp. 175-176.The last martyrs of Eromanga : being a memoir of the Rev. George N. Gordon and Ellen Catherine Powell, his wife by Gordon, James Douglas, 1863Paton, John G., Missionary to the New Hebrides: An Autobiography (1889; reprint; Ross-shire, Great Britain: Christian Focus, 2009), pp. 123-125. The labour trade and blackbirding Between 1863 and 1906, around 40,000 people from what was then the New Hebrides were blackbirded onto ships to work as indentured labour on cotton and sugarcane plantations in Queensland, Australia. Another 10,000 went to work in nickel mines in New Caledonia and on plantations in Fiji, Samoa and Hawaii.Lighter & Naupa 2005, p. 41 Many of the islanders recruited were duped into taking part, some were coerced and some volunteered. While some Erromangan names are listed in official records of Melanesian labourers in Queensland, no exact figures exist for the number of Erromangans who were blackbirded. However, 25 years after the White Australia Policy ended the Melanesian labour trade in 1906, Erromango's population had dwindled to just 381.Crowley 1997, p. 34. Missions and Cannibals John Williams of the London Missionary Society and fellow missionary James Harris were killed and eaten by cannibals at Dillons Bay in 1839.Paton, John G., Missionary to the New Hebrides: An Autobiography (1889; reprint; Ross-shire, Great Britain: Christian Focus, 2009), p. 56. In November 2009, after a lengthy collaboration between the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia, the Presbyterian church of Vanuatu and the Vanuatu Cultural Centre, Williams' descendants travelled to Erromango to reconcile with the descendants of those who killed their ancestor, the Uswo-Natgo clan, 170 years earlier.Naupa 2011, p. 98. To mark the occasion, Dillons Bay was renamed Williams Bay. The Rev. George Nicol Gordon, of Prince Edward Island, Canada and his wife, Ellen Catherine Powell, missionaries from the Presbyterian Church of Nova Scotia to the New Hebrides, were killed at Dillons Bay on May 20, 1861. A memoir of the couple appeared in book form, at Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1863. In total, six missionaries were killed on Erromango.Shineberg 1967, Ch. 16. An oral history from Unpogkor (Dillons Bay) says Rev. Williams was killed because he disrespected an important kastom ceremony that was taking place when he landed.Naupa 2011, p. 94. As Williams was the first Christian martyr in the south Pacific, Erromango became a particular focus for missionisation.Carillo- Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.101. Canadian Presbyterian missionary H.A. Robertson, resident on Erromango from 1872–1913, succeeded in missionising the island's population. This changed the traditional society of the island. His attempts at missionisation were effective because he carefully studied the beliefs and material culture in order to target the most powerful symbols of traditional society. He collected many objects and sent them to overseas museums or used them as curios in his overseas fundraising tours to demonstrate the 'backwardness' of Erromangans.Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.93. In 1902, Robertson published Erromanga: the Martyr Isle, his description of his life as a missionary on the island. It was the first popular account of Erromango and its people. It promoted to a global audience the idea that Erromango was the 'Martyr's Island'.Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.94. Robertson's predecessor, Rev. James A. Gordon, had spread the belief amongst Erromangans that the Christian God had sent the 1861 measles epidemic to punish them for the killing of Rev. Williams and the other missionaries. Gordon saw this as a means of gaining converts, though some of his contemporaries disapproved of this tactic.Shineberg 1967, ch. 16. This tactic backfired on Gordon, as he and his wife were killed in reprisal for the epidemic, which continued unabated despite their deaths. Over time, Gordon's myth grew into a collective belief amongst Erromangans that the island had been cursed by the Presbyterian Church. This caused the abandonment of forms of cultural expression not sanctioned by the church.Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.91. Belief in this 'curse' endured until the 2009 reconciliation ceremony, which initiated a re- examination of Erromango's history and culture from an Erromangan point of view. According to a participant, \\"the reconciliation has freed us up to embrace our customs and traditions, which we couldn't do before because of the guilt attached to Erromango's history and the tendency to view traditional culture as the antithesis of Christianity\\". Later history Erromango and nearby Tanna were devastated by cyclone Pam in mid-March 2015, with reports from Tanna of an unknown number of deaths, complete destruction of the island's infrastructure and permanent shelters, no drinking water.The Guardian:Cyclone Pam: more deaths and water shortages to follow storm, 15 March 2015 Geography The total area of Erromango is 891.9 km². It measures approximately 48 km from the north-west tip to the south-east, and is between 20 and 30 kilometres wide. Its highest point is Mount Santop, at 886m. The island is situated between latitude 18°37'S and 18°59'S and 168°59'E and 168°20'E. Vete Manung Island is located 15 km off the north-east coast of Erromango. In the middle of the east coast is a promontory formed by the volcanic cone of Mount Rantop. 6 km off the east coast is an uninhabited islet named Vetemanu (English name Goat Island) of approximately 12ha in area.Siméoni 2009, p. 85. The island is part of the Vanuatu rainforests ecoregion, within the East Melanesian Islands biogeographic region. Dense evergreen forest covers nearly three-quarters of the island on the windward (eastern) side, while a combination of grassland and woodland occupies the north-west. Cloud forests exist at higher elevations. Much of the vegetation on the island is secondary growth.Siméoni 2009, p. 88. Formerly it was known as a source of sandalwood in the 19th century, and much of it was depleted. It is also home to the kauri and tamanu trees. There has been extensive logging, but most of the area is recovering, and efforts are underway to try to make the industry sustainable. With European Union support, there is a protected Happy Lands Kauri Reserve. Geology Erromango, like most other islands of the Vanuatu archipelago, is volcanic in origin. It is composed of basalt and andesite from the late Miocene-Recent periods and is situated along a Pliocene-Recent volcanic chain that is moving to the north-northwest. Most of the island is fringed with a platform of uplifted coral reef limestone dating from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene.Neef & Hendy 1988, p. 484 Volcanism Erromango was formed during a prolonged period of volcanic activity took place between 6-1 Ma. The island is an ancient underwater volcano that has been raised 100-300m above sea level by tectonic uplift, forming a plateau on which stand three sets of eroded volcanic cones in the centre, north and east of the island. The centre is divided into two volcanoes; Mount Melkum (758m) to the west, and Nompun Umpan (802m) to the east. In the north of the island, Mount William (682m) is a strombolian cone with a caldera 6 km wide and around 600m deep.Siméoni 2009, p. 85 The eastern peninsula that forms Traitor's Head, north of Cook's Bay on the east coast, is the youngest volcanic formation on the island and consists of four stratovolcanoes (Urap, Ulenu, Rantop and Wahous). A submarine volcano between the peninsula and nearby Vetemanu last erupted in 1881. Population Erromango's population at the last census in 2009 was 1,959. The annual population growth rate is 2.2%, and there are a total of 325 private householdsVanuatu National Statistics Office 2009a, p. 13. on the island. The largest villages are Dillons Bay (Upogkor), Potnarvin and Ipota. Languages Erromango was linguistically diverse prior to European contact. Since contact, however, Erromango has lost between 67% and 83% of its original languages. The island \\"has the dubious honour of having suffered the greatest amount of linguistic devastation in the region of Oceania outside of Australia\\", according to Pacific linguist Terry Crowley. While the original distribution of languages is not well documented, there were originally at least four distinct Erromangan languages: Enyau/Yocu, Ura (also known as Aryau), Utaha (also known as Etiyo or Ifo) and Sorug/Sye (also spelt Sie or Siye).Lynch, John. 1983. The languages of Erromango. In John Lynch (ed.), Studies in the Languages of Erromango. Pacific Linguistics C-79. Canberra: Australian National University, pp.1-10. Sorug and Utaha are now extinctLynch, John. n.d. Utaha and Sorung: Two Dead Languages of Erromanga. Unpublished ms., found in Arthur Capell’s documents archived at PARADISEC. and only a few elderly Ura speakers remain.Crowley 1997, pp. 33-34. These four languages constitute the Erromanga branch of South Vanuatu languages. Due to a lack of documentation, it is unclear whether Sorug and Sye were two distinct languages or whether they were dialects of a single language. There is also evidence of two additional speech forms, Novulamleg and Uravat, though it is not known whether these were dialectical variants, distinct languages, place or area names, names of descent groups or simply descriptive names.Crowley 1997, pp. 33-58. The depopulation that followed the series of epidemics of the mid-19th century resulted in a linguistic realignment. Villages that were no longer viable because of population loss either relocated or amalgamated with others, and the island's population dispersed. Yocu/Enyau was the dominant language during the late 19th century, as it was the language of the Dillons Bay area where the missionaries were based, and the language used in the first missionary bibles.Crowley 1997, pp. 38-60. Enyau/Yocu and Sorug/Sye merged between the 1870s and 1920s to become modern Erromangan.Crowley 1997, pp. 53-56. Some linguists call this language Sye, however on Erromango nam Eromaga ('Erromangan language') is more common.Lynch, John. \\"The languages of Erromango\\".

Climbing history There is no record of attempts on this mountain prior to the successful first ascent in 1953. In May–June of that year, a party from New Zealand climbed the peak via the Northeast Ridge route, placing five camps. The Himalayan Index lists three more unsuccessful attempts, in 1983, 1994, and 2000, but no more ascents of the peak. ReferencesSources *H.

Early life A native of Ridgeway, Wisconsin, Davis attended the University of Wisconsin–Platteville, where he played on the basketball team as a point guard. He was interested in politics, and between his junior and senior years of college, held a congressional internship for Wisconsin state senator Alexander Wiley. Coaching career After graduating from UW–Platteville, at the age of 21, Davis took over as head coach at Milledgeville High School in Milledgeville, Illinois for the 1960–61 school year. He attempted to mimic the martinet coaching style of his own college mentor, John Barth, but concluded that \\"You have to be yourself. What works for someone else isn't going to work for you just because it worked for him.\\"Dr. Tom's magic elixir: Davis is a basketball coach with a system that works, The Milwaukee Journal, March 22, 1982. From 1961 to 1966, Davis was head coach at Portage High School in Portage, Wisconsin. While there, he faced a dilemma in allotting playing time to his players, most of whom he believed were good enough to warrant it. Davis awarded playing time to all deserving players, which gave rise to his philosophy of constantly pressing and rotating players in an effort to wear down the opposing team. Davis earned a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In 1967, Frank Fellows took over as head coach at the University of Maryland, and hired Davis onto his staff.Boylan Recalls Where It All Began, Issue 142: October 2009.

While at Iowa, he led the Hawkeyes to nine NCAA Tournaments, including a pair of Sweet Sixteen appearances as well as an Elite Eight. The Hawkeyes also made two NIT appearances. He is the winningest coach in the University of Iowa history. His team was ranked number one during the 1986-87 season. The Hawkeyes won a school record thirty games before eventually being beaten in the Regional Final of the NCAA Tournament by UNLV 84-81. On April 2, 1998, after Iowa lost in the first round of the NIT, Davis announced that he would resign after his contract would expire in the following season. Athletic director Bob Bowlsby notified Davis that he would not renew his contract. In Davis's final season, Iowa advanced to the Sweet 16 round of the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1988. Drake University Davis was named Drake University's 23rd head basketball coach on April 22, 2003.

During the Second World War, the United Kingdom was the only country to develop and widely employ purpose-built armoured command vehicles. Those were essentially armoured buses based on truck chassis. The most common ACV of the British Army was the AEC 4x4 ACV. The vehicle, based on AEC Matador chassis, entered production in 1941. A total of about 415 units were built. The vehicle was used for the first time in the North African Campaign and remained in service until the end of the war. Big and comfortable, it was nicknamed Dorchester by the troops, after the luxury hotel in London. Three ACVs of this type were captured by the German Afrika Korps. Two of them, named \\"Max\\" and \\"Moritz\\", were employed by Rommel and his staff throughout the campaign. In 1944 a larger AEC 6x6 ACV was developed. The vehicle was based on AEC 0857 lorry chassis and was powered by the AEC 198 150 hp engine. The hull was welded from 9 mm thick rolled steel. The weight of the vehicle reached 17 tons. One hundred and fifty one units were built. Both vehicles were built in two configurations, called LP (Low Power) and HP (High Power), with different radio equipment.

Early life Alfred Pease was a member of the family of Quaker industrialists, known in Britain as the Darlington Peases. He was the elder son of Joseph W. Pease, 1st Bt and his wife Mary Fox. His younger brother gained a peerage and became Joseph Albert Pease, 1st Baron Gainford. Alfred was educated at Grove House School, Tottenham, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Career He began his career in the family bank, J. & J. W. Pease, of which he later became both a director and partner. He held similar positions in Pease & Partners, whose subsidiary interests embraced collieries, Ironstone mines, limestone quarries, as well as iron manufacturing, fabrication and construction. In the course of his years, he served as managing director, Vice-Chairman (1907) and chairman (1927) of the Owners of the Middlesbrough Estate. From 1885 until 1892 he was one of the two Liberal Members of Parliament returned for York, and then from 1897 until 1902 the Cleveland division of Yorkshire.Hansard Millbank Systems – Alfred Pease During his years in parliament, he served as a J.P. and Alderman for the North Riding of Yorkshire, a Deputy Lieutenant for Cleveland division, as well as being appointed to the Lieutenancy for the City of LondonDebretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 He was also a founder and President of the Cleveland Bay Horse Society. Pease had apparently indicated that he was in declining health before the general election of 1900 but was pressed by his local Liberal Association to contest that election. He did so on condition that if his condition made it impossible for him to sit for the whole Parliament he would be allowed to resign, and by September 1902 he referred to ill-health and asked to step down. He did so with the appointment as Steward of the Manor of Northstead on 21 October 1902. With the failure of the family business interests in 1902, he thus brought his political career to a close and amidst the wreckage sought out new opportunity, which was to take him to South Africa.A Wealth of Happiness and Many Bitter Trials. 1992.(Sir) Joseph Gurney Pease. Africa Sir Alfred Pease (centre) in 1909, hunting with former US President Theodore Roosevelt (right) and Roosevelt's son Kermit Between 1903 and 1905, Pease served as a Resident Magistrate at Barberton in what was then the Transvaal Colony, but now Mpumalanga, in South Africa, before moving to the opposite end of the continent, to explore the Sudan, Somaliland, and the northern Sahara. During this time he continued to write of his travels and experiences; a habit that had begun with his \\"Biskra and Oases of the Zibans\\" (1893) and followed by \\"Hunting Reminiscences\\", (1898). \\"The Badger\\", (1898). \\"Horse Breeding for Farmers\\", (1902). and \\"Travels and Sport in Africa\\", (1902). \\"Rachel Gurney of the Grove\\", (1907). \\"The Diaries of Edward Pease\\", (1907). \\"The Book of the Lion\\", (1914) and \\"Memoir of Edmund Loder\\", (1922). In 1906, he leased more than of prairie land in the Athi Plains region of British East Africa, southwest of present-day Nairobi. There he founded an ostrich-ranch and hunted the game which was at that time plentiful on Kenya's high plateaus. The Pease property, Kitanga near Machakos was situated close to the Uganda Railway, and this enabled Sir Alfred to host a number of the famous travellers who hunted during the great age of safaris. As a result, he is mentioned in many of the personal accounts of the period. Theodore Roosevelt, who enjoyed Pease's hospitality in 1909, with his son Kermit, at the start of his world-famous expedition to Africa, described Sir Alfred as 'a singularly good rider and one of the best game shots I have ever seen.'Roosevelt, Theodore, African Game Trails, New York 1910, Charles Scribner's Sons, page 26 In 1909 he became one of the founder members of the Shikar Club formed to promote the activity of hunting and shooting Big Game animals. Specimens from Sir Alfred's animal collections can be seen at the Dorman Museum. Pease died aged 81 in 1939, and his eldest son, Edward Pease (1880–1963), succeeded to the baronetcy. When he died, the title passed to his elder son by his third marriage, (Alfred) Vincent Pease (1926–2008), who died without issue. The baronetcy then passed in 2008, to Sir Alfred's youngest son, being the younger son of the third marriage, Joseph Gurney Pease, who became the 5th Baronet and is the current holder of the title. Family Pease married three times. His first marriage in 1880, was to his first cousin, Helen Ann Fowler, third child of Sir Robert Fowler, 1st Baronet. The marriage produced two sons and a daughter. His second marriage, in 1912, was to Laure Marianne Sugnet de Montmagny and was childless. His last marriage, in 1922, was to Emily Elizabeth Smith and produced two more sons and two more daughters. The second son, Captain Christopher York Pease http://www.cwgc.org/find-war- dead/casualty/181183/PEASE,%20CHRISTOPHER%20YORK, was killed in the last year of World War I, on 9 May 1918, and was buried in the Mazingarbe Communal Cemetery Extension. A cousin from what would become the Daryngton branch, Lt. Ronald Herbert Pike Pease of the Coldstream Guards, had already been killed in 1916. Christopher Pease was serving in the Yorkshire Hussars. Captain Pease was older than the norm and was 31 when he died. Katherine Routledge was a first cousin of Pease, and she visited him in Kenya in 1904. Later she and her husband led the Mana expedition to Easter Island from 1913–1915, during time which she carried out excavations of the island's monuments, and recorded oral history of the island's past.
