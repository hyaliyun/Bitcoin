History Administration building with generating building in the background The Power Station was constructed between 1913 and 1916 by the Western Australian State Government, which announced that the facility would generate all the electricity needed in the Perth Metropolitan area. The site of East Perth was chosen because coal could easily be delivered there by rail and because the enormous quantities of cooling water required by the condensing plant could easily be drawn from the Swan River. Construction was completed at a total cost of ¬£538,000.East Perth Redevelopment Authority, Fact Sheet East Perth Power House in 1929 In the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s new power generators were added to the facility to meet the city's growing demand for power. By 1948 the station had an array of power generating sources.p.261 of Tait's electrical Directory of Australia and New Zealand, 12th Edition, 1948, Tait Publishing, Melbourne, Vic.: 3 International Combustion boilers, 10 Babcock & Wilcox marine-type boilers; as well as Green's economisers and Parson's turbo-alternators In 1968 the station converted from coal to oil, but six years later returned to coal firing. The station was decommissioned and closed in December 1981, as more advanced and cheaper methods of electricity generation made the facility redundant.

Proposed redevelopment In the 2000s the East Perth Redevelopment Authority developed a draft master plan for the site's future use, which went out to the public during a three-month community consultation period (7 November 2004 ‚Äì 28 February 2005). Site works commenced in July 2004 and included a general clean up, building stabilisation and weather proofing. In early 2005 the Government of Western Australia appointed a Major Stadia Taskforce to report on the construction of a new stadium in Perth. Its final report recommended the construction of a new 60,000-seat stadium at either Kitchener Park (which adjoins Subiaco Oval) or at the East Perth Power Station site. In early 2008 the Government confirmed that Subiaco Oval would be demolished for the new Perth super-stadium to be built next door at Kitchener Park.Perth to get new $1.1 billion stadium The Age 8 February 2008 This site was chosen ahead of the other suggested site at the Power Station, which was instead to house a new $500 million museum.Government of Western Australia, Media Release: 'New major sports stadium for Western Australia', 8 February 2008 Planning and design of the new museum was to begin in 2008, with construction expected to begin in 2012.

In it, two to four players, each representing a \\"master\\" of one of the four Greek elements (earth, fire, wind, and water) battle each other, and a non-player character called the Shadowlord, to become master of the universe.  Rules  = Object of the game = The object is to destroy the armies of opponents, and of the shadows, before the timer runs out and the shadowlord wins and the game is over. = Objects = Below is a list of objects required to play the game and their purpose. *Power Rings: These are the rings that the discs that are in play go in. *Character discs: These specify the name and power level of the characters. *Spaceships: These are required to move, and also to lay claim to galaxies players are not currently in. *Power cards: These are used in battle, explained later. *Battlefield: A big blue board where battles (explained later) are held. *Universe: The board that the game is played on. Each space is a galaxy, and the corner galaxies are \\"building stations\\" (explained later). *Power Stone: An object put into a spaceship slot on the power ring that allows an extra power card to be drawn in battle (explained later). Initially owned by the shadowlord, but can be taken from him if he is defeated in battle. = Legend = He ruled the galaxies of the Universe with wisdom and justice ... and by powers the likes of which no man or woman has ever possessed. His name was the Starlord, and his word was Law. When he grew old, the Starlord created a beautiful and mysterious crystal which harnessed his wondrous powers so that they might be preserved for the Starlord‚Äôs five children. He called it the Power Stone. When the Starlord‚Äôs death came to pass, into the Shadow Master‚Äôs hands fell the Power Stone. He became the Shadowlord, and a glorious civilization crumbled into darkness and decay. If this civilization is to flourish again, one of the four remaining heirs must emerge as the Starlord‚Äôs successor. Who will it be ... the Earth Master of Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn? ... The Air Master of Gemini, Libra, and Aquarius? ... The Fire Master of Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius? ... The Water Master of Cancer, Scorpio, and Pisces? Or will the Shadowlord overpower them all? The four would-be Masters of the Universe travel throughout its galaxies in search of Warriors, Merchants, and Diplomats. Will the four Masters be powerful enough to defeat opposing alliances in exciting and suspenseful duels? ... Strong enough to withstand attacks from the Shadowlord's mysterious deputies and field commanders? ... Mighty enough to challenge their dark brother the Shadowlord, whose greatness in battle is a legend within a legend, for ownership of the Power Stone? The secret to survival is accumulation of power, sabotage of opposing alliances, and the strategic use of one‚Äôs resources. So prepare for an extraordinary adventure among worlds, space- storms, and the Shadowlord‚Äôs eerie Lost Fortress ... Where promises last until the next tempting bribe ... Where battles are fierce and defeat is forever. = Classes = Below is a list of the classes and their description. *Masters (Power levels: 8‚Äì10) These are the most powerful and important characters in the game. If a master is killed, that player is out of the game. **Level 8 Masters: Air, Earth, Fire, Water (all human) **Level 10 Masters: Invincible Darkness, Shadowlord *Warriors (Power level: 6) These are the second most powerful, and are the most useful as decoys in battle. **Human Warriors: Astrid, Axel, Holger, Kaare, Randi, Sten **Alien Warriors: Bernhard (Bear), Viggo (Lizard) **Shadow Equivalents: The Iron Claw, Baron Cruel, Counts Hector and Gwyth, Duke Halifax *Merchants (Power level: 3) Merchants are capable of doing battle, but are most useful for building spaceships. **Human Merchants: Arne, Brandon, Elayne, Faye, Folke, Selwyn **Alien Merchants: Svein (Pig), Vang (Tiger) **Shadow Equivalents: Marshalls Racson and Lynx *Diplomats (Power level: 0) A diplomat never fights, however, they are the only characters who can overturn character discs. **Human Diplomats: Aage, Deems, Elfrida, Erling, Ola, Sigurd **Alien Diplomats: Bors (Weasel), Gye (Mouse) **Shadow Equivalents: none *Shadows (Power levels: 3‚Äì10) Shadows are the antagonists of the game. The Shadowlord starts with the power stone. = Initial board setup = The Shadowlord is placed in a black power ring, given one of the power stones and five black spaceships, and placed in the center galaxy (the one with the castle in it). The minor shadows are placed circling the Shadowlord and are given one black spaceship each. A protagonist character disc is placed face down in each of the other galaxies except the home planets of the masters. Each player chooses a master and is given one warrior, one diplomat, and three spaceships which they can distribute to the three members of the force any way they choose. The three allies for each player are placed on the master's home planet. = Gameplay = Players roll the die to see who goes first. A turn takes place with the following actions in this exact order. 1\\\\. Draw Power Cards: The player draws at least one, and an additional one for every corner galaxy the player controls. The player can either place them underneath a portrait for or face down in their attack hand (for use in battle). 2\\\\. Roll the dice and follow the directions of the corresponding number on the guide card rolled. 3\\\\. Build spaceships: Players get three spaceships for every merchant they own, three for every corner galaxy they control, and they can discard cards from their attack hand (added to in step one) and redeem it for the corresponding number of ships. 4\\\\. Move: Players may move any character with a spaceship in its power ring they like, but may only move as many spaces as that character has spaceships. If they are the first player to cross into a galaxy, they may discard their spaceship onto that galaxy, and they control it. If a diplomat passes into a galaxy that has a face-down character disc, that diplomat may recruit that character into his alliance. 5\\\\. Move a minor shadow: Each shadow can only be moved one galaxy at a time, and they never discard their spaceship and own the galaxy. The Shadowlord is never moved. 6\\\\. Do battle: Battle occurs when a character moves into another galaxy that another player controls or occupies without his or her permission. Shadows never give permission to cross into the galaxies they occupy. Battle consists of the following: Each character in the galaxy (or a character of the defenders choice if the galaxy is controlled by the presence of a spaceship) is placed on the battlefield. Each participating combatant may choose one (and only one per character) power card from underneath its portrait or from the generic attack hand. The attacker places this extra card face down, while the defender places it face up. The attacker then turns up his extra card. A power card is drawn from the deck for each character in the battle, with the one controlling a power stone being able to draw yet another power card, and the players total up their side's power levels, spaceship count (only spaceships in the character's power ring count), and the value of all their power cards, and whichever side has the highest total, that player wins the battle. A card is then drawn for each of the losing characters, and that number is how many spaceships they lose. If a character is penalized more spaceships than it has, that character dies and is liquidated from the alliance. If the master dies, that player is out of the game entirely. If a player defeats a character with a power stone (either the Shadowlord or the one who took the power stone from the Shadowlord), that character then takes possession of the power stone. At the end of battle, all cards used are discarded. If the Shadowlord still holds the power stone, every time the deck of power cards are reshuffled, the power stone timer (which looks exactly like the power stone itself, so it does not matter which one is which) is moved up a slot in the power stone timer base. If the timer reaches the final slot, the game is over and all players lose.

The original Vauxhall Gardens were located in a more confined space on Greenwich Street near the Hudson River between what later became Warren and Chambers streets in the fashionable Sixth Ward; Public School 234 stands at the site today.Henderson, Mary C. (2004). The City and the Theatre: The History of New York Playhouses, a 250-year Journey from Bowling Green to Times Square. New York City: Back Stage Books. . Ratzer's map shows its square garden plot, conventionally divided in four by walks. Fraunces operated the venue until 1773, when he offered it for sale. His notice mentioned two large gardens, a house with four rooms per floor and twelve fireplaces, and a dining hall that was long and wide, with a kitchen below. The Vauxhall offered light summer concerts and featured an outdoor wax museum. For the summer 1768 season, it hosted an exhibit on the life of Scipio Africanus that included a grove with a reconstruction of the military leader at his tent. The Vauxhall remained popular throughout the Colonial period of New York and to the end of the 18th century. By this point, the gardens had two namesake competitors, one of which was primarily popular for its ice cream.Savelle, Max (2005 [1948]). Seeds of Liberty: The Genesis of the American Mind. Kessinger Publishing. . As New York City expanded, streets of rowhouses with rear gardens swallowed the site. In 1798, owner Joseph Delacroix moved his operations to Broome Street between Broadway and the Bowery. In 1805, it moved, this time to Lafayette Street, stretching from 4th to 8th streets in what were then the northern reaches of the city, the area that later became Astor Place, 4th Street, Broadway, and the Bowery. Professional travel writer John Lambert visited in November 1807 and wrote, \\"Ranelah Gardens\\" on a British map of 1776 > New York has its Vauxhall and Ranelagh; but they are poor imitations of > those near London.

In 1826, he carved out an upper-class neighborhood from the site with Lafayette Street bisecting eastern gardens from western homes. Wealthy New Yorkers, including Astor and other members of the family, built mansions along this central thoroughfare. Astor built the Astor Library in the eastern portion of the neighborhood as a donation to the city. Architect Seth Geer designed eye-catching row houses called LaGrange Terrace for the development, and the area became a fashionable, upper-class residential district. This location made the gardens accessible to the people of both the Broadway and Bowery districts. In the summer of 1838, the owners opened a saloon for the staging of vaudeville comic operas. Later theatre managers expanded the offerings to appeal to a wider range of patrons. By 1850, the rowdier crowds of the Bowery had mostly scared off the upper classes, and revenues suffered. The theater buildings were demolished in 1855, and the gardens closed for the last time in 1859.

Programs within the Faculty of Engineering are accredited by professional bodies including Engineers Australia, the Project Management Institute and the Australian Computer Society. History Teaching of engineering at the University began in 1883 within the Faculty of Science established just a year prior. The Faculty of Engineering itself was established in 1920. Initially engineering classes were taught in The Quad, however in 1909 the P.N. Russell School of Engineering was completed. This building, an outcome of the P.N. Russell benefactions was formally opened by the Governor on 20 September 1909. With the expansion in student numbers in the 1950s and early 1960s, new purpose built facilities were constructed in the Darlington extension area across City Road and since the mid seventies all departments have been accommodated in this area, although a wind tunnel in the Woolley Building is still in use by Aeronautical Engineering. The new SciTech Library opened in the Darlington engineering precinct in 2010, as the amalgamation of the Architecture, Engineering, Madsen and Mathematics libraries, brought together as part of the Campus 2010 project.

Initially established on 22 March 1910, it is the second oldest established veterinary school in Australia, the longest running veterinary school in Australia and one of two universities offering veterinary degrees in New South Wales. The faculty offers a joint Bachelor of Veterinary Biology/Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (BVetBiol/DVM), having retired the former Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc), and the Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience (BAnVetBioSc). The Faculty is established across both Camperdown and Camden campuses. The faculty is usually associated with the Roundhouse or Centaur as a logo and celebrated its centenary in 2010. The Faculty will be incorporated into the Faculty of Science in 2017. History The Faculty of Veterinary Science officially opened in 1910 with a student enrolment of 16 students and James Douglas Stewart appointed as Director. Without proper facilities, teaching was done in the then Fisher Library of the Main Quadrangle but relocated to the J.D. Stewart Building in 1913 after its completion. In 1920, the Veterinary School obtained full faculty status with Professor J.D. Stewart as Dean. Under Stewart, student enrolments gradually increased from 25 in 1928 to over 100 in 1935. In 1930 and during WWII, Sydney University became solely responsible for veterinary education in Australia after temporary closures of both Melbourne University and Queensland University‚Äôs veterinary schools respectively. In 1954, the acquisition of land by the university in Camden paved way for large animal teaching and subsequently the erection of the Evelyn Williams Building and R.M.C. Gunn Building in the Camperdown precinct. More recently new facilities include the Veterinary Science Conference Centre in 1998, the Valentine Charlton Cat Centre and the Canine Teaching Hospital. In 2005, the faculty introduced the Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience and in 2009, Rossane Taylor became the first female Dean of the faculty. In 2014, the Faculty made the transition from an undergraduate to post-graduate veterinary degree by replacing the long-standing Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc) with the joint Bachelor of Veterinary Biology (BVetBiol) and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM). Intake of students for the Bachelor of Veterinary Biology commenced in 2014 and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 2015. The last intake of students for the Bachelor of Veterinary Science occurred in 2013 and will graduate in 2017. Degrees =Undergraduate= Bachelor of Veterinary Biology/Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (BVetBiol/DVM) The Faculty of Veterinary Science introduced the joint Bachelor of Veterinary Biology (BVetBiol) and Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) in 2014, replacing the Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc). The joint degree is composed of two components spanning over six years - an undergraduate animal science degree that runs for the first two years (BVetBiol) and postgraduate veterinary science degree running for the remaining four years (DVM). Undergraduate students that successfully complete the academic requirements for the first two years of the BVetBiol are accepted into the first year of the DVM, whereas students that are unable to meet the academic requirements of progressing into the third year of the programme (first year DVM) can transfer into third year Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience (BAnVetBioSc) or complete a Bachelor of Science (BSci). Postgraduate students may also transfer into the DVM without attaining a BVetBiol by meeting academic requirements and proving commitment to the veterinary field. Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience (BAnVetBioSc) The Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience was introduced in 2005 and focuses more on the production and research aspects of animals. The degree extends across 4 years (full-time) with a research task based on the final year. Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVSc) The Bachelor of Veterinary Science was a degree offered since the conception of the faculty until 2014 when the Faculty transitioned the veterinary degree to a post-graduate programme. The last intake of students was in 2014, with the final graduating class of the Bachelor of Veterinary Science being 2017. Students undertook 5 years of full-time study with the first three years at the Camperdown campus, fourth year at the Camden campus, and the final year completing rotational intern positions. The degree is recognised by the Veterinary Surgeons Board in every state of Australia and also recognised internationally by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons in the United Kingdom and the accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) in the United States. Bachelor of Science (Veterinary) (BSc(Vet)) The Bachelor of Science (Veterinary) is a one-year research degree, only available to students who have completed their third or fourth year of the BVSc degree. Facilities and Heritage buildings =Camperdown Campus= J.D. Stewart Building The J.D. Stewart Building is the first veterinary building built for the university and named after the faculty‚Äôs founder and first dean, James Douglas Steward. Completed in 1913, three years after the faculty‚Äôs first students; it was granted heritage listing in 1976. Today, it houses the faculty office, Veterinary Society office and anatomy dissection labs. The Roundhouse The Roundhouse is a black wooden, heritage-listed rotunda located on the Vet lawns of the Camperdown campus. It was designed by Professor Lesley Wilkinson in 1920 and completed around 1924. Originally utilised as an equine observation box, the Roundhouse is no longer in use and was refurbished by the university in 2009. It is commonly used as a symbol for the faculty and prominently featured for the faculty‚Äôs centenary. Veterinary Science Conference Centre The Veterinary Science Conference Centre (VSCC) is a triple-storey building that mainly houses Webster Lecture Theatre. Sydney University Veterinary Teaching Hospital The Sydney University Veterinary Teaching Hospital is a general practice veterinary clinic consisting of the Valentine Charlton Cat Centre and the Canine Teaching Hospital. The hospital contains CT, MRI, digital radiology and ultrasound imaging and diagnostic equipment as well as 24-hour emergency and intensive care. The facility also caters as a teaching hospital for veterinary students to learn professional aspects of the degree. As of late 2016, management of the teaching hospital will be handed over to VetPartners, a for-profit US based company. =Camden Campus= The Camden campus is located approximately 65 km away from the Camperdown campus. Located on campus includes teaching space, farms and student accommodation. The campus‚Äô main purpose is to provide large animal handling skills for undergraduate students and research for post- graduates. It is the site where the world‚Äôs first robotic rotary dairy was opened. The Camden campus is also the home of third year DVM students, having formerly been the home for fourth year BVSc and AVBS students prior to the inception of the current postgraduate program. Student Societies and Publications =Sydney University Veterinary Society (VetSoc)= The Sydney University Veterinary Society, more commonly known as VetSoc by students, is the University of Sydney‚Äôs second-oldest student run society on campus and represents students of the Bachelor of Veterinary Science, the Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience, the Bachelor of Veterinary Biology and Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine. The society plans social events for faculty students and functions as one of the main links between students, staff, alumni and the profession. They help to produce several publications each year. The annual publication, 'The Centaur', was founded in 1933 and has released an issue each year. In more recent times, the society has produced a quarterly publication as well called 'The Chiron'. In 2010 and 2014, VetSoc was voted as the Best Student Society in the university. The official logo is the Centaur. =Camden Farms Student Society (CFSS)= The Camden Farms Student Society, more commonly known as Camden Farms by students, is the University of Sydney‚Äôs veterinary student-run society on its Camden campus. While is presently represents students of the Bachelor of Veterinary Biology and Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine, it formerly also included those of the Bachelor of Veterinary Science and the Bachelor of Animal and Veterinary Bioscience programs prior to their discontinuation. The society plans social events such as the annual Around the World Keg, Vinnie's Ball, Dean's Dinner, Camden Weekender Day Games and other activities. =Animal Welfare Society= The Animal Welfare Society is a society that aims to promote and address issues in animal welfare both domestically and internationally. Although head mainly by veterinary faculty students, it is open to all students across the faculties of the university.

It subsequently appeared on several of Young's live recordings. A 2014 Rolling Stone special issue on Young ranked it as Young's best song ever. It has been covered by Band of Horses, Cowboy Junkies, Beat Farmers, Rusted Root, Jazz Mandolin Project, Drive-by Truckers, Feelies spin- off Yung Wu, Car Seat Headrest, and Phish. The Australian rock band Powderfinger took their name from this song. Lyrics and music \\"Powderfinger\\" is the first song of the second, electric, side of Rust Never Sleeps. Allmusic critic Jason Ankeny describes the song, following the album's mellower, acoustic first side, as \\"a sudden, almost blindsiding metamorphosis, which is entirely the point ‚Äî it's the shot you never saw coming.\\" The lyrics are the posthumous narration of a young man who attempts to protect his family against an approaching gunboat. He realizes that all of the older men are unavailable, leaving him \\"to do the thinking\\". After initial indecision, he eventually takes action, and is ultimately killed. He describes his death with the gruesome line \\"my face splashed in the sky.\\" Johnny Rogan describes the last verse as the character's \\"moving epitaph\\": :Just think of me as one you never figured :Would fade away so young :With so much left undone :Remember me to my love; I know I'll miss her The lines about fading away so young echo the line \\"it's better to burn out than to fade away\\", which Young sings on the opening song of Rust Never Sleeps, \\"My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)\\". Ankeny feels that the song's first-person narrative \\"evokes traditional folk storytelling\\" but the music is \\"incendiary rock & roll\\", and praises the \\"mythical proportions\\" of Young's guitar solos as the story approaches its \\"harrowing\\" conclusion. Allmusic critic William Ruhlmann described the song as \\"remarkable\\", considering it the best of the great songs on Rust Never Sleeps. Rogan describes it as one of \\"Young's great narrative songs\\" and \\"almost cinematic in execution.\\" Rogan also praises Crazy Horse's backing as \\"ideal\\" and permitting Young to \\"invest the song with epic significance.\\" Rolling Stone critic Paul Nelson compared the violence in the song to the helicopter scene with Robert Duvall in the movie Apocalypse Now in that it is \\"both appalling and appealing ‚Äî to us and to its narrator ‚Äî until it's too late.\\" According to Nelson, it generates \\"traumatizing\\" tension and \\"unbearable\\" empathy and fascination as he \\"tightens the screws on his youthful hero with some galvanizing guitar playing, while Crazy Horse cuts loose with everything they've got.\\" Nelson points out that the music incorporates \\"a string of ascending [guitar] notes cut off by a deadly descending chord\\", what critic Greil Marcus described as \\"fatalism in a phrase\\". Rolling Stone contributing editor Rob Sheffield calls \\"Powderfinger\\" \\"an exorcism of male violence with shotgun power chords rising to the challenge of punk rock.\\" Author Ken Bielen compares \\"Powderfinger\\" to film noir because the narrator has died before the song begins, and notes that the song \\"has remained in high regard over the decades.\\" Bielen regards the theme as \\"the tragic and wasteful loss of youth to conflicts between countries and their leaders. Nelson suggests that although it opens the Crazy Horse rock 'n' roll side of the Rust Never Sleeps, it is the album's \\"purest folk narrative\\". On Rolling Stone's \\"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\\" list they state that on \\"Powderfinger\\" \\"Young's guitar hits the sky like never before.\\" Critic Dave Marsh claimed that \\"Young wrote as brilliant a statement of American nihilism and despair as any rock writer has created.\\" History Young recorded a solo acoustic version of \\"Powderfinger\\" at Indigo Ranch Recording Studio in Malibu, California in September 1975, and intended it for his unreleased mid-70s album Chrome Dreams. He later sent the tape to his friend Ronnie Van Zant of Lynyrd Skynyrd who were to use the song on their next album.. However, Van Zant died in a plane crash in October 1977, and Lynyrd Skynyrd never recorded the song. The song was officially released in an electric version on Young's 1979 album with the band Crazy Horse, Rust Never Sleeps. The Indigo take was released in 2017 on Hitchhiker alongside other tracks from the session.

He is known for starting the first Bioethics Advisory Committee in the United States.  Early life  Dr. Cifarelli was born in Queens, New York on August 22, 1928. Nicholas, at a very young age showed an appreciation for fine arts. He viewed sculpture at his uncle's foundry, Roman Bronze, Inc. Later, he furthered his education in the arts, working eight years at the Metropolitan Opera, and was privileged to see every classical ballet the opera presented. This exposure created a deep love of the classics and was his inspiration to become a sculptor, where he later incorporated the time for this interest while practicing medicine.  Education  Dr. Cifarelli began as an undergraduate in 1946 at Saint Peter's College (New Jersey). He studied Chemistry, was a standout pitcher on the baseball team and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in 1949. Soon after he attended Georgetown University School of Medicine where he pursued a medical education. In 1954 he graduated with a medical degree. Later, Cifarelli pursued his interest in Sculpture where he studied under Professor Salvatore at Columbia University in 1964. He continued his education in this subject at Queens College in 1965. In 1971 he completed an extension course in Sculpture at UCLA. He also took sculpture courses at Pasadena City College in Pasadena, CA from 1972-1973.  Medical Residency & Naval Career  After receiving his medical degree from Georgetown University Dr. Cifarelli went back to Queens, New York to start his medical internship at the Flushing Hospital & Medical Center. After completing his internship he started his medical residency, choosing the specialty of Internal Medicine at Flushing Hospital & Medical Center. After finishing his medical residency Dr. Cifarelli joined the United States Navy as a Medical Officer. He was stationed in Coronado, CA. After finishing his military service he relocated back to Queens, New York to begin a medical career as a private practice physician. After he gained some experience in private practice he decided to further his medical education and began his fellowship (medicine) in Nephrology (under J.E. Cimino, M.D.) at the Bronx VA Hospital, in the Bronx, New York.  Private Practice Career  Cifarelli practiced medicine in New York City until 1968. In 1968 he moved to Los Angeles. Throughout his medical career in Los Angeles he was elected Chief of Staff at several different hospitals in the area. He also held numerous other positions during his career. In 1985 he was granted the title of Clinical Assistant Professor in Medicine from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1994 the San Gabriel Valley Medical Center named the medical library in his name to show their appreciation for the dedication Dr. Cifarelli put forth throughout his career. Cifarelli was a Fellow of the American College of Physicians. He retired in 1996.  Bioethics Advisory Committee  He became well known in 1984 when he pioneered the first Bioethics Advisory Committee in the United States at the San Gabriel Valley Medical Center. Cifarelli maintained a \\"pull the plug\\" mentality throughout his medical career. He believed the patient and their family should not have to suffer through debilitating illnesses when there was no quality of life.  Sculpture Sculpture was one of Cifarelli's passions. Cifarelli completed a lifelike sculpture of Rudolf Nureyev, the world-renowned ballet dancer; the head was presented to Nureyev at the Greek Theatre (Los Angeles). Some of Cifarelli's work has also been showcased at The Sculptors III Gallery in Palm Springs, CA.  Death  Cifarelli died Christmas Day, 2005 after battling an illness. At the time of his diagnosis he stated that he did not want to be put on life support which reflected the views that he stressed during his career. Previous to his death he resided in San Marino, CA with his family.

Television coverage and format The event was broadcast on Nuts TV in the UK from the last 16 onwards. The tournament was open to PDPA members and citizens and Green Card holders from the USA and Canada. The elimination tournament was played down to the last 16 on the Friday and the last 16 played off on Saturday. The quarter-finals onwards took place on Sunday. In addition, the PDC also staged the $50,000 North American Darts Championship on the 16th and 17 May. Tournament Review =Friday 16th May= Five American players made it through to the last 16 as there were a series of shock results on the opening day of the event. The biggest shock was when Gary Mawson beat world number one and five-time former World Champion, Raymond van Barneveld in the last 32. Current World Champion, John Part went out in round two to Roger Carter who also progressed to the last 16. Bill Davis beat Tony Eccles to reach Saturday's main stage competition. David Fatum and Ray Carver completed the American line-up of five in the last 16. World number four, Terry Jenkins also suffered a surprise defeat at the hands of Paul Lim, the man who achieved the first ever World Championship nine darter in 1990. World number seven, Andy Hamilton, was beaten in the third round by Buddy Lessig. Number three seed, James Wade withdrew from the event due to illness. Out of the top 8 seeds, only two, Phil Taylor and Roland Scholten, made it to the last 16. =Saturday 17th May= The fifth round action opened with David Fatum being the first player and first American to reach the quarter finals, beating out fellow countryman Bill Davis. Davis however did save some face with a 164 checkout, the highest of the night. Roger Carter was another American player to lose out, to Chris Mason. Mark Dudbridge also put on an impressive display in beating Dave Honey in straight sets. Veteran Dennis Priestley moved into the quarters, dropping only one leg against Adrian Gray. Phil Taylor continued his imposing form, averaging 107 against Colin Osborne, who did take a set out of 'The Power'. American Gary Mawson, who had earlier knocked out the number one seed Raymond van Barneveld, lost 3‚Äì1 to Blackpool's Ronnie Baxter, and Colin Lloyd also looked to be in menacing form, not dropping a leg against world number eight Roland Scholten.

The tournament was worth $50,000, with $15,000 going to the winner. It was played separately from the US Open on the 16th and 17 May, though players could enter for both tournaments. Darin Young, who had been knocked out in the first round of the US Open, emerged the victor. On the first night the main shock was the defeat of World Champion and number one seed John Part, who was beaten by Buddy Lessig in the third round. The number two seed, Gerry Convery, also lost in the second round to Paul Lim. Leading American and third seed Ray Carver was defeated in the fifth round by Brad Wethington and John Kuczynski was beaten in the quarters by Brian Blake. The second night saw the semi-finals and final being played out. Number eight seed Darin Young beat out Bill Davis in a close 7‚Äì5 game in the first semi-final, while Brad Wethington just beat Chris White in a 7‚Äì6 affair. The final followed suit. Wethington missed a dart to win the title before Young came back to win 8‚Äì7 and claim the title. Young said it was 'the biggest win of [his] career'. That moment was dubbed the 'most interesting' part of the Championship.

Built in 1867, it was the home of General Oliver Otis Howard, the university founder and its third president. The house was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and It faces Georgia Avenue NW, just north of Howard Place.  Description and history  The General Oliver Otis Howard House is located on the west side of the Howard University Campus. It is separated form Georgia Avenue to the west by a parking lot, and from 6th Street by the Johnson Administration Building, which forms an L around its north side. It is a 2-1/2 story painted brick building, with a mansard roof providing a full third floor, and a fieldstone foundation that is exposed on the west and south due to the sloping terrain. A three-story tower projects from the southwest corner, rising to a low balustrade surrounding a mansard roof, which is crowned by iron cresting. Windows are set in segmented-arch windows, and dormers in the roof face have elaborate carved surrounds. The interior retains some original features, but has in parts been altered to provide modern office space. The house was built in 1867 as the home of General Oliver Otis Howard. Of four buildings erected during the founding phase of Howard University, it is the only one still standing. The university was chartered in 1867, when General Howard was serving as commissioner of the federal Freedmen's Bureau. In that role, Howard was a major supporter of improved educational opportunities for newly freed African Americans. As a member of the First Congregational Church of Washington, he was instrumental in that congregation's support for creating of the institution as a seminary and normal school. Howard's house was purchased by the university in 1909.

Since the album was released several years before Art and Artie went \\"public\\" about their identities, the reference is more of an in-joke. \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic provided the accordion on \\"Gumby Jaws Lament\\". Artie (Robert Haimer) was originally to sing \\"Gumby Jaws Lament\\", but Art had a terrible cold that day, and they decided his gravelly, phlegmy voice added to the song. The coughing throughout the song is real. Mook and Beanhead, mentioned in both \\"Party in my Pants\\" and \\"When You Die\\", were pet names for Art and Artie's recently (at the time) ex-girlfriends. Posse, mentioned as the Lumanian phrase for \\"I love you\\" in \\"The Lumanian Love Song\\", was Artie's dog. Nicknames for several other people Art and Artie knew are also mentioned in the song (such as the aforementioned \\"Mook\\").

As a baton, or macehead. Power is obvious, but the origins may have also had references to magic, or the idea of driving-off bad spirits or omens. A \\"sacred\\", or protected area is therefore created, by the action implied and used by the \\"Arm with Power stick\\". A term used in later Ancient Egypt was 'ta djeser', the 'land-sacred'. Thus temples, or mortuaries, or areas for ritual could be created. Language usage of \\"Arm with powerstick\\" The basic language equivalent of Arm with powerstick hieroglyph is 'djeser', or 'tjeser', meaning \\"holy\\", or \\"sacred\\". The hieroglyph is also used as a determinative to emphasize a word, for example line 6 of the Rosetta Stone, uses one of the commonest words with the Arm-throwstick: 'nekht' , (i.e. \\"to be strong\\", \\"powerful\\"). In Ptolemy V's Rosetta Stone, line 6: ...\\"Ptolemy, the Avenger of Baq-t-(Egypt), the interpretation whereof is \\"Ptolemy, the strong-one-(with determinative) of Kem-t-(Egypt)\\" ...\\" Pharaoh Nectanebo II had variations of his name with the same word 'nekht', for \\"strength\\", and the Arm with Power stick determinative. The Greek goddess Nike used the same word for the meaning of herself: 'strength', and 'victory'. Rosetta Stone usage as 'sacred' The Rosetta Stone lists 22 reasons for honoring the Pharaoh, Ptolemy V, then relates 10 items for honoring pharaoh, the last erecting his 3-script decree. In the list of the reasons for honoring pharaoh, he gave monies to honor the \\"sacred animals\\" of Ancient Egypt in their rituals; thus, pharaoh: \\"He gave thing every[which]-(Everything!) they needed for the embalmment of their bodies abundantly, lavishly-(djesertu).\\"-(line 3) The second usage is the setup before the Rosetta Stone announces the 3-script Decree to be inscribed, and displayed. It states, for cognizance, (gnostic-to know): :...the dwellers in Egypt, glorifying-(djeser), the God appearing-(Ptolemy V - epiphanous), the lord of benefits-(Greek: eucharistos), even as is most right and proper.

Jesus College, Oxford, one of the constituent colleges of the University of Oxford, is run by the principal and fellows of the college. The principal of the college must be \\"a person distinguished for literary or scientific attainments, or for services in the work of education in the University or elsewhere\\".Statute III \\"The Principal\\", clause 1 \\"Qualifications\\" The principal has \\"pre-eminence and authority over all members of the College and all persons connected therewith\\" and exercises \\"a general superintendence in all matters relating to education and discipline\\".Statute III, clause 4(a) \\"Duties\\" The current principal, Sir Nigel Shadbolt, was appointed in 2015 and is the thirty first holder of the office. This figure does not include Seth Ward, who was elected principal by the fellows in 1657 but never installed: Oliver Cromwell, Chancellor of the University at the time, appointed Francis Howell instead. Fourteen Principals have been former students of the college, the first being Griffith Powell, elected in 1613, and the most recent being Alfred Hazel, elected in 1925. The longest-serving Principal was Henry Foulkes, from 1817 to 1857. When the college was founded in 1571 by Queen Elizabeth I, the first charter installed David Lewis as principal and named eight others as the first fellows. The statutes of 1622 allowed for 16 fellows. There is now no limit on the number of fellowships that the governing body can create.Statute IV \\"The Fellows\\", clause 3 \\"Number of Fellowships\\" The college statutes provide for various categories of fellows.Statute IV, clause 1 \\"Classes of Fellows and qualifications\\" Professorial fellows are those professors and readers of the University who are allocated to the college by the University.Statute IV, clause 5 \\"Professorial Fellowships\\" One of these professorships is the Jesus Professor of Celtic, which is the only chair in Celtic studies at an English university. Holders of the position since its creation in 1877 include John Rhys, Ellis Evans and Thomas Charles-Edwards. The zoologists Charles Godfray and Paul Harvey are both professorial fellows. Official fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. Past official fellows include the composer and musicologist John Caldwell, the historians Sir Goronwy Edwards and Niall Ferguson, the philosopher Galen Strawson and the political philosopher John Gray. There are also senior and junior research fellows. Principals and fellows who retire can be elected as emeritus fellows. The college can also elect \\"distinguished persons\\" to honorary fellowships.Statute IV, clause 23 \\"Honorary Fellowships\\" Ship Street entrance gate A further category is that of Welsh supernumerary fellows, who are, in rotation, the Vice-Chancellors of Cardiff University, Swansea University, Lampeter University, Aberystwyth University, Bangor University and the University of Wales College of Medicine. There is one Welsh supernumerary fellow at a time, holding the position for not longer than three years.Statute IV, clause 4 \\"Welsh Supernumerary\\" The first of these was John Viriamu Jones in 1897.Baker (1971), pp. 62‚Äì63 The college formerly had a category of missionary fellows, known as Leoline fellows after their founder, Principal Leoline Jenkins. In his will in 1685, he stated that \\"It is but too obvious that the persons in Holy Orders employed in his Majesty's fleet at sea and foreign plantations are too few.\\" To address this, he established two fellowships, whose holders should serve as clergy \\"in any of his Majesty's fleets or in his Majesty's plantations\\" under the direction of the Lord High Admiral and the Bishop of London respectively. The last of these, Frederic de Winton, was appointed in 1876 and held his fellowship until his death in 1932. This category was abolished in 1877 by the Oxford and Cambridge Universities Commission, without prejudice to the rights of existing holders such as de Winton. Another category of fellowship that was abolished in the 19th century was that of the King Charles I fellows, founded by Charles I in 1636 and tenable by natives of the Channel Islands in an attempt by him to \\"reclaim the Channel Islands from the extreme Calvinism which characterised them.\\" The first such Fellow was Daniel Brevint. Whilst the founding charter did not require the fellows or the students to be Welsh, the college has long had strong associations with Wales. Between 1571 and 1915, only one principal (Francis Howell, 1657‚Äì1660) was not from Wales or of Welsh descent. Many of the fellows in the past were also Welsh, since when new fellowships were created by benefactions (often by people of Welsh descent) there was frequently a stipulation that the recipients would be related to the donor or come from a place in Wales specified by the donor. These specific limitations were removed as part of reforms of Oxford University during the 19th century.

Background Because of the strong locals supporting for a federation, Corowa became the backdrop to many federation meetings and speeches. The [Australian Natives' Association] played a large part in the federation and local support for the concept was evident in the fact that the first [Australian Natives' Association] branch in New South Wales was founded in [Corowa]. In fish 1892 Edmund Barton an advocate of the federation and Australia's first prime minister visited Corowa to urge consideration of the convention bill up before the New South Wales Parliament. He also supported the idea of local federation leagues. The first of these leagues was founded in Albury and Corowa. It was then picked up in other Murray River towns. They eventually all banded together and formed the [Border Federation League]. Several months later William Drummond of the Berrigan Drive branch of the Federation League proposed the idea of a conference to revive flagging interest in a federation.Corowa Federation Plac lup seep es Group, Corowa, NSW Profile  Footnotes  Category:History of Australia (1851‚Äì1900) Category:Riverina Category:1893 in Australia ","title":"Corowa Conference"},{"id":"17352006","text":"Jeff Sheng (born California) is an American artist and photographer. He was a visiting guest professor of photography at Harvard University in 2011. He taught as a visiting assistant professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara for the departments of Studio Art and Asian American studies between 2007 and 2012. He is a recipient of The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans. Sheng's photography work has been described as \\"historic\\" in capturing the social progress experienced by the LGBT community in the United States in the early 21st century. His 2009-2011 photography series \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" documented almost 100 closeted LGBT United States military service members affected by the Don't ask, don't tell policy, that forbid United States military service members from openly identifying as gay or lesbian. Sheng's photographs of these closeted service members were widely published and reported on by the media during the Congressional repeal of the policy between 2010 and 2011, including in TIME Magazine, Newsweek, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, CNN, ABC World News, CBS Evening News, NPR, and the BBC News; and his photographs were extensively circulated among service members, military officials in the Pentagon, as well as members of Congress during the repeal process. Commenting about Sheng's work, Pulitzer Prize winning columnist Leonard Pitts wrote, \\"There is something sharply poignant in these images of those who do dangerous work most of us never have, make sacrifices most of us never will, yet are forced to hide their faces for fear of what it would mean if we knew who they are... The result was this stirring work that has been featured everywhere from the New York Times to the Los Angeles Times to CNN to the BBC.\\" On June 23, 2012, Sheng photographed the civil union of Will Behrens and air force service member Erwynn Umali, the first public same-sex wedding ceremony held on a United States military base and officiated by a military chaplain, since the official repeal of Don't ask, don't tell on September 20, 2011. Sheng first became known for his photographic project \\"Fearless\\", a series of portraits of athletes on high school and college sports teams who also openly identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. Sheng began the project in 2003, and by 2012, the series had over 150 portraits of athletes from the United States and Canada. Sheng has exhibited the project at over fifty colleges and high schools across the United States. \\"Fearless\\" has also been exhibited at the headquarters of sports media network ESPN, the 2009 LGBT Human Rights Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, and Nike World Headquarters. For the 2012 Summer Olympics, Sheng released a 10-minute video slideshow of \\"Fearless\\" that was exhibited at Pride House 2012 as part of the London Olympics, which marked the debut of the project in Great Britain. In August 2008, Sheng collaborated with former N.B.A. basketball player and fellow activist John Amaechi in Beijing, China during the 2008 Summer Olympics, on a blog in partnership with Amnesty International. Amaechi utilized Sheng's knowledge of Mandarin and previous experience as an American exchange student in Beijing to get behind the scenes in many situations and to gather candid interviews with local people and Olympic athletes. In 2004, Sheng photographed Evan Wolfson and Mary Bonauto for The New York Times Magazine for an in-depth article written by David J. Garrow about the struggle over the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts and the United States. Sheng attended Harvard University and studied under the mentorship of British photographer and Harvard professor Chris Killip in the Visual and Environmental Studies Department. For his senior thesis submitted to Harvard in 2002 for his BA degree, Sheng created a small photo album titled \\"Thesis Album,\\" consisting of sixty 4\\" by 6\\" photographs of his personal same-sex relationship from college, with just half a page of writing. His senior thesis was awarded a Latin honors grade of summa cum laude, nominated for a Thomas T. Hoopes, Class of 1919, Prize, and Sheng was given the college's Louis Sudler Prize in the Arts by then President of Harvard University Lawrence Summers. In 2002 and 2003, Sheng interned for gallery owner and art curator WM Hunt (Bill Hunt) in New York City, and then briefly assisted for the celebrity/fashion photographer Greg Gorman in Los Angeles. Sheng received his Master of Fine Arts (MFA) in Studio Art from the University of California, Irvine in 2007. His MFA Thesis Exhibition included a large forty foot wide by six foot high digitally constructed panoramic photographic installation, titled \\"Where Matthew Lay Dying: Laramie, Wyoming,\\" originally shot and taken from the spot and vantage point where the hate crime/murder victim Matthew Shepard was found on a fence post outside Laramie, Wyoming.

The parish includes both farmland and forests. It has its border with the great lake V√§nern in the east and is in the middle of Dalbo plain. At the location of a former church (300 m north of the present church) there is a monument in honor to the old church and of Lieutenant General Axel Erik Roos, who is buried on the site. The monument was erected in 1919. Roos was an officer in the army of King Karl XII and is well known for having three times the same day saved the life of the king during the so-called kalabaliken (skirmish) in Bender, Moldova. Gestad was previously dominated by the manor L√∂v√•s situated around 1 km southeast of the church. The parish was previously known for the extensive cultivation of oats. Oats were exported in the late 19th century, to a large extent, inter alia, to the London area (horse fodder). The Gestad area has been characterised by the words: \\"Heaven and oats\\". Church attendance has previously been high in Gestad. In the parish there are two churches belonging to the Church of Sweden - Gestad and Timmervik churches - and also a mission chapel that is of interest. In Gestad church, built 1796-1799 and consecrated in 1800, is a very old baptismal font (\\"dopfunt\\") in sandstone. It is known that it was made sometime in the 12th or 13th century. There is also a ‚Äùdopfat‚Äù made in Nuremberg, Germany at the end of the 15th century, donated to the church by General Roos¬¥ family. The church previously stored general Roos¬¥ sword and spurs, but these were stolen in a burglary in the 1980s and have never been found. The painting over the altar was added in 1914 and is a drawing by Hj Tessing. The painting shows when Jesus walked on water. Every year, in early July, there is a major meeting in Gestad with the display of tractors and ploughing. The author Per Olof Ekstr√∂m (1926‚Äì1981) was born, raised and lived in Gestad. He engaged in farming while he was also a writer. Ekstr√∂m wrote nearly 50 books. Best known to the general public is the book Sommardansen, which formed the basis for the movie One Summer of Happiness (). The book reflects, in literary form, the mood among rural youth in the late 1940s. Near the church, at a place named Mur√§ngen, has been found the foundations of a larger building. One theory is that there was a larger courtyard country manor from the Viking Age, or some time later. The manor probably also had a smaller church or chapel. A major archaeological excavation took place in the years 1986 to 1990. Sikhall bathing place, and camping is in the parish. The school of Skerrud covers grades 1 to 6.

Upon graduation, he was posted to No. 825 Squadron aboard in the Mediterranean. He remained on the ship until August 1939, when he left for England to attend a Meteorological Course. However, due to the outbreak of war, the course was abandoned and Smith was appointed to the new carrier . Second World War In 1940, Smith took part in operations off Norway with Ark Royal, before receiving a posting to No. 821 Squadron based at RNAS Hatston. On 21 June, he led six Swordfish biplanes in carrying out the first- ever torpedo attack by aircraft on a capital ship at sea. The raid was conducted against the German battleship off the Norwegian coast while subject to heavy anti-aircraft fire. The Scharnhorst suffered no hits by the torpedoes, and all six aircraft managed to return safely to land. For his actions during the attack, Smith received a Mention in Despatches. In August, Smith was sent to join No. 807 Fighter Squadron aboard . The ship was used to protect convoys in the Western Approaches against the German Condor aircraft. In February 1941, the squadron joined , and was tasked with the protection of shipping off the African coast.

After the sinking of the Ark Royal, Smith returned to Australia where he was appointed as liaison officer to the United States Navy heavy cruiser . He served in this position until May, when he was appointed to HMAS Canberra as the observer for aircraft. Smith served aboard the cruiser until it was sunk in the Battle of Savo Island during the Guadalcanal landings on 9 August 1942.

It dominates the Coigach peninsula, in the county of Ross and Cromarty, 10 kilometres north-west of the town of Ullapool. It reaches a height of 743 metres (2438 feet). Its coastal location, combined with its high topographic prominence to height ratio, make it a very good viewpoint. It is a Scottish Wildlife Trust nature reserve.  Ascents  Ben Mor Coigach can be climbed from Bleughasary (where there is a car park) to the south-east or from Culnacraig to the south-west. From Bleughasary, follow a land rover track (not shown on the OS map) as far as Loch Eadar dha Bheinn, then pass the outflow east of the loch and head up onto the east ridge. From here the route passes over the Speicin Coinnich and onto a large and flat summit area. The Speicin Coinnich is quite exposed but not as steep as it may appear from below. A better starting point, albeit one requiring a longer drive in, may be Culnacraig. From here, follow the line of a long ridge towards the summit of Sgurr an Fhidhleir (the Fiddler). This summit can either be included, or traversed via its south face, before the final ascent of Ben Mor Coigach from the north-east. More direct routes are possible but appear to be steep and stony. Several more summits, forming a horseshoe ridge, can be included.  The Postman's Path  Some walkers may be tempted to ascend from one of the above-mentioned starting points, then descend to the other before completing the tour on part of the \\"postman's path\\" along the coast from Achiltibuie to Strathcanaird. The maps and signposts imply that the relevant stretch is about six miles long, but the warnings under the signposts do not do justice to its dangers. Even a fit walker may struggle to complete this leg in less than four hours, and most walkers should allow considerably more time, depending on fitness and the weather. There is no path along much of this route, there is only an incomplete and inadequate series of cairns and arrowed posts. It is hard to avoid straying from the route. Scrambling is required in several places, and some of these are exposed to sea cliffs. There are several unbridged crossings of fast flowing streams which may be difficult or even impossible in spate conditions. Bogs contribute further to the difficulties. Despite its low altitude, this route is steep and regarded as a true mountain experience. It is so named because it was used by postmen before the village of Achiltibuie was connected to the road network.

It became a #3 hit on the Billboard Pop singles chart. The song was written by Bob Crewe and Frank Slay, who had also written the A-side, \\"Silhouettes\\". The song became a #1 single on the Australian singles charts when covered by novelty band Drummond in 1971, and remained there for seven weeks. NOTE: Used for Australian Singles and Albums charting from 1970 until ARIA created their own charts in mid-1988. UK cover band Darts also had a hit single with the song, which reached #6 in 1977. Cover versions Fellow 1950s doo-wop band The Diamonds, from Canada, covered both sides of The Rays' single \\"Silhouettes\\"/\\"Daddy Cool\\" in the same year (1957) and saw their version reach #10. UK artists Darts' first ever studio recording was \\"Daddy Cool\\" which they released as a 1977 single. It peaked at #6. Guy \\"Daddy Cool\\" Darrell released a single on the Warwick label in 1961 entitled \\"Daddy Cool, Daddy Cool (Daddy Cool, Cool, Cool)\\". However, it is unrelated to the Rays record except for having been inspired by the title. The Guy Darrell record was written by Gluch-D'Agostino. In 1989, Berkeley pop-punk band Sweet Baby performed a version on their sole album, It's a Girl. Also covered in 1958 by Linden, NJ band the Bonnevilles, with Wayne Tevlin on lead vocals.

In January 1971, they recorded a studio version for their debut album Daddy Who? Daddy Cool, which was released in July 1971. This, in turn, was covered by another Australian band, Drummond (pseudonym for Adelaide band Allison Gros), which recorded the song in a Chipmunks style and released it as a novelty single in 1971. Already in the National Singles charts at #1 for ten weeks was Daddy Cool's record- breaking hit \\"Eagle Rock\\", which was displaced by Drummond's tribute single \\"Daddy Cool\\". 'Drummond' was a rotating house pseudonym employed by Festival Records to release novelty records by a series of musicians; this particular Drummond single was the work of the band Allison Gros, consisting of Graeham Goble, Russ Johnson and John Mower. They moved to Melbourne and subsequently recorded their own material as Mississippi and then, with the addition of Beeb Birtles, evolved into Little River Band.

Later production moved to Belgium, in and around Ypres. The industry continued onto the 19th century on a diminished scale. By the 19th century valenciennes lace could be made by machine. Valenciennes lace is made on a lace pillow in one piece, with the r√©seau (the net-like ground) being made at the same time as the toil√© (the pattern). It differentiates itself from other types of lace because the openness of the r√©seau, the closeness and evenness of the toil√©, which resembles cambric, and that it lacks any cordonnet (a loosely spun silk cord used to outline and define the pattern). Also, in real Flemish Valenciennes lace there are no twisted sides to the mesh; all are closely plaited, and as a rule the shape of the mesh is diamond but without the openings. The r√©seau ground is made of four threads braided together, with eight threads at the crosses, which makes it very strong and firm. This is simpler and easier to make than the ground for Mechlin lace, though similar in appearance. Valenciennes lace received an impetus in the seventeenth century, when the Scheldt was channelled for river navigation between Cambrai and Valenciennes, benefiting the export of Valenciennes' wool, fabric and fine arts. To use up flax yarn, women began to make the famous Valenciennes lace. Early Valenciennes lace was grounded with fancy mesh which was thicker and closer than the open r√©seau used later. The more open version was developed in Valenciennes, and thus the type of lace became known under the name of the town. The open mesh started to evolve in the 18th century and by the 19th century the characteristic ground made of four braided threads was in use. By the 1900s little of the famous lace was still made in Valenciennes.

In order to remain practical for the modern game, the boot's construction included updated materials and improved manufacturing techniques, to create a product significantly lighter than its 1978 counterpart. For the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Adidas released the adiPURE in a black/sun colourway in honour of the tournament's host nation, South Africa. In 2015, the adiPURE were discontinued.Adidas Discontinues Adidas Adizero, Adipure, Nitrocharge and Predator Boots on Footy Headlines, 5 May 2015 Models =adiPURE (2008)= The original adiPURE was available at launch in both the traditional black/white and a white/black colourway, these were later followed by blue/white and silver/black colourways. The boots were constructed using high quality k-leather and displayed many design features similar to Adidas' World Cup 1978 boots, including three lines of stitching on either side of the toe and a short tongue. =adiCORE & Telstar II= The adiPURE was accompanied by two other, less expensive, boots. adiCORE and Telstar II; these boots were visually very alike, with only subtle aesthetic differences but reduced performance and cheaper materials, such as a full- grain leather upper. =adiPURE II (2009)= The adiPURE II was again released in White/Black, and Black/White colourways, with the Blackout (all black), Black/Metallic Gold, White/Cardinal and Brown/White colourways being released later. Notable design differences from the original adiPure included the omission of the three stripes on the instep of the boot, the addition of a contrasting collar and the implementation of an asymmetric lacing system. =adiCORE II & adiNOVA= The second generation of adiPURE was accompanied by another set of lower-end models, with the usual minor cosmetic differences and the use of a full-grain upper. The Telstar name was replaced with adiNOVA. =adiPURE III (2010)= The adiPURE III was also released in Black/White colourway, but this time accompanied by a White/Blue colourway on release. Other colourways later released included White/Gold, Gold/Black, Black/Sun, Blue Beauty/White, White/Black/Poppy, Black/Warning and White/Warning. Notable design differences from the adiPURE II included the return of the three stripes on the instep of the boot, although noticeably shorter and wider than on the original adiPURE. It also featured an adiPRENE insert in the sole. =adiCORE III & adiNOVA II= Again the cheaper adiCore and adiNova variants of the boot were made available with similar differences in pricing and quality. =adiPURE IV (2011)= Announced 1 December 2010, the adiPure IV followed the trend of adidas' 2010 range of football boots by undergoing a significant weight reduction verses previous incarnations. As well as being the lightest adiPure at the time of release, the adiPure IV was also the first adiPure boot since the adiPure I to feature a central lacing system and a tongue separate to the rest of the upper. Adidas also moved the classic three- stripes further towards the toe-end of the boots, giving them a look more reminiscent of the classic adidas boots of the 1950s, like those worn by the German national football team in the 1954 World Cup. The adiPure IV officially launched on 1 January 2011 with two colourways; Black/White/Poppy and White/Black/Fresh Splash. The release of the adiPure IV marked an increase in price for the range, with the price points of both the FG & SG models increased to ¬£120. A Light Scarlet/White/Black colourway was also made available in early February. =adiPure IV SL (April 2011)= The adiPURE IV SL is the lighter counterpart of the adiPURE IV boot (SL standing for \\"super light\\".) =adiPURE 11pro (2012)= The next generation of adiPure boots were released in February 2012 and were known as the 11pro. An updated look included an engineered ultra thin 360¬∞ support saddle for increased stability and compatibility with Adidas' MiCoach system. Somewhat controversially for purists, Adidas transitioned from a K-Leather upper to Taurus leather for the 11pro. =adiPURE 11pro SL (2012)= The adiPURE 11pro SL was the lighter counterpart of the adiPURE 11pro. Unlike the adiPURE 11pro, it featured a combination of a K-Leather (Kangaroo Leather) toe and a SprintSkin heel, allowing the boot to weigh in at just 180 grams. The boot also featured a SprintFrame outsole, MiCoach and Traxion studs. The adiPURE 11pro SL was released on 1 February 2012 in a Black/Core Energy colorway.

The school is situated in Paarl, a town in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. The first headmaster of the school was Rev. George Jeffreys, followed by James Rettie,\\"Photograph of staff members and pupils, Gymnasium Boys' School, Paarl.\\", National Archives and Records Service of South Africa (depot KAB, source AG Collection, ref. AG16780), 1885. Mr J Inglis and Mr TW Engela followed by Mr L Knoetze. As of 2007 the headmaster of the school is Mr Derek Swart. Early history The first building to house the school was a granary on Zeederbergplein, the owner of which was Mr D Beyers. The first years of the school were unstable ones, with the school increasing in size every year, and larger facilities were required frequently. The grounds on which the school stands today were originally formed part of the farm Berlyn owned by Mr PJ Malherbe. A certain Mr Moll purchased the farm and donated the land to the school. In 1901 PJ du Pr√© Le Roux became headmaster. Du Pr√© Le Roux was the first headmaster to establish the school and remained at the reins for over two decades. Mr Le Roux also saw the construction of the boarding hostels of Monte Bello (1901), Bellevue (1904), Villieria (1907), Berlyn (1908) and Imhoff (1923). The hostels of Berlyn and Villieria were dismantled and were replaced by another hostel, namely Werda. Sport Each year the school takes part in one of the biggest interschool events in South Africa against its arch-rival, Paarl Gimnasium High School. The main event (the u/19A rugby match) attracts over 20 000 spectators to the Faure Street Stadium. The school has produced many Springboks, from Boy Louw, Mannetjies Roux and \\"Prince of Wings\\" Carel du Plessis, to more recent players like Corne Krige (former Springbok Captain), Gurthro Steenkamp, Frans Malherbe and Thomas du Toit. Other sports that are also included in interschool events are: field hockey, cricket, swimming, tennis, chess, golf and even debating. Golfing professional, David Frost, also matriculated at Paarl Boys' High. Paarl Boys' High School is currently ranked as one of the top rugby schools in South Africa. Students of the 2 schools have traditional nicknames; the Boishaaiers are known as 'galpille' and the Gimmies as 'bloedworse'. Uniform and tradition The school uniform consists of a light blue shirt adorned with the school coat of arms, grey shorts or trousers, a striped blue and white tie, a dark blue blazer striped with light blue and white. Brown shoes over grey socks are worn as well, the socks are edged at the top with the school tricolour. All grade 8s wear silver buttons on their ties and blue buttons on their blazers, marking their low ranking in the school. Merit colours are only awarded to matrics and grade 11s who have achieved with distinction on the sporting field, academics or the cultural front. These merit colours differ considerably from the standard uniform; the blazer is solid and deep navy blue in colour, without stripes. The tie is also navy blue and stripeless with the addition of the school crest in silver at the knot. The so-called \\"full colours\\" blazer, which is only awarded to those who have attained the top achievement in his field, is adorned with a more prestigious looking badge of the school, which is silver in colour and rests on top of two laurels. The standard \\"half colours\\" blazer is the same as the \\"full colours\\" blazer, but instead features the normal school badge.  War crys  The Paarl Boys' High War cry, or 'Kreet', has changed much over the years, but the current Warcry is as follows: Shimalaya wha! Shimalaya wha! HJS HJS Wha 'sop - 'sop 'sop 'sop We are - we are HJS HJS Wha 'sop, Shimalaya wha!

It provides medical education at undergraduate, postgraduate and superspecialty levels. History Dr. John Berry White, MRCS, a British surgeon of the East India Company, was the pioneer to start health education and health care in Assam. He established a medical school known as 'Berry White Medical School' at Dibrugarh, Assam in 1898-99. The school was upgraded and on 3 November 1947 the Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh, was established and it stands as the first medical college in Assam. With increasing demands for health care and health education, the need for more medical colleges in Assam was felt. The state government in 1959 headed by Mr. B.P. Chaliha, the Chief Minister of Assam, Mr. Fakaruddin Ali Ahmed, the Finance Minister, and Mr. RupNath Brahma as the Medical Minister of Assam decided to have a second medical college in Assam. On 7 November 1959 the state government set up a committee to go into the matter and submit their report. After several rounds of discussions, the committee visited sites at Ulubari, Jalukbari, Chandmari and other areas of the city of Guwahati and also parts of Silchar. The committee submitted its report on 26 April 1960 stating that it was feasible to start the Gauhati Medical College from August 1960 in the vacant Ayurvedic College buildings and the Physical Education Training buildings at Jalukbari, Guwahati but no such place was immediately available at Silchar to start the Silchar Medical College. The committee recommended Ulubari for Gauhati Medical College and Ghungoor for Silchar Medical College to be the permanent sites. So the state government started the colleges with preclinical classes in the vacant buildings of the Ayurvedic College at Jalukbari, Guwahati with 60 students for Gauhati Medical College and 40 students for Silchar Medical College as a twin college. By a state government order no. MM-D/275/60/45 dated 26 June 1960, Dr. S.N. Sarma, the Principal and Supdt. of the Assam and Supdt. of the Assam Medical College & Hospital, Dibrugarh was entrusted with starting the preclinical classes at Jalukbari from August 1960 and with starting medical colleges at Gauhati and Silchar in addition to his duties in the AMC, Dibrugarh. Accordingly, the vacant Ayurvedic College buildings at Jalukbari were taken over and arrangements were started by August 1960. On 20 September 1960, the functioning of the Gauhati Medical College was formally inaugurated. The first batch of the 100 students were interviewed and selected in the AMC, Dibrugarh in the last week of September 1960. Preclinical classes were started from 10 October 1960. There was no provision for staff and students at Jalukbari. At Chandmari, about 15 km. away from Jalukbari, 73 tenements of the Industrial Housing Colony, some vacated houses of the Civil Surgeon's office, and also some vacated houses of the Engineering Institute were acquired where accommodations were provided to the staff and students who did not have their accommodations elsewhere at Guwahati. Students and staff were transported in government buses from Chandmari to Jalukbari and back. Lady students were accommodated in Ayurvedic College hostel building when available. Subsequently, two temporary barracks were also built in the Physical Education Training building at Jalukbari where second year students were accommodated while the first year students had to come as before. The Gauhati Medical College (GMC) took its start under the stewardship of Professor I. Jahan from October 1960 to June 1961. Professor S.N. Sarma was transferred from AMC, Dibrugarh and he took over the charge of the Office of the Principal, Gauhati Medical College on 3 June 1961. Professor S.N. Sarma was the founder Principal of the Gauhati Medical College and he took great interest in the construction of the permanent college and hospital complexes. Paraclinical and clinical departments were started in the Civil Hospital Campus at Panbazar, Ulubari Maternity Home, Emigration Hospital (later on Infectious Diseases Hospital) and T.B. Hospital at Birubari, Guwahati as and when they became available. The members of the teaching staff were brought from Assam Medical College, Dibrugarh. Due to non availability of a qualified person for professorship in SPM, the Medical Council of India permitted Dr. E. Lyngdoh, Professor of Medicine to be in-charge of the SPM department as its head. Later on Dr. A.C. Patowary took over as its head. Dr.G.C. Medhi took over as the Head of the Department of Forensic Medicine from the Civil Surgeon, Guwahati. Prof. I. Jahan was appointed as the Vice-Principal and Deputy Superintendent of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital. Mr. Sarbananda Das was appointed as the Head Assistant of the college and Mr. Basanta Goswami became the Head Assistwnt of the hospital. When Mr. Sarbananda Das was left as secretary of the Silchar Medical College Mr. R. Nobis joined as secretary in GMC. The government of Assam constructed the permanent buildings of the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital on the Narakachal hill. The P.W.D., government of Assam, took up the survey and started road constructions in 1962 in the Narakachal hill. The Assam Government Construction Corporation (AGCC) started building construction in February 1962. Hostels were given priority and started in the foothills of the Narakachal hill. The hostels were completed and taken over and occupied in between August 1965 and October 1966. The girls' hostel was occupied in June 1968. Late Mr. B.P. Chaliha, then Chief Minister of Assam, laid the foundation stone of the college building in the year 1963. The construction of the main college and administrative building at the Narakachal hill top could be started by the AGCC in April 1965 after the road was completed to the top by the PWD. Part by part the main college building was taken over from April 1968 to which Preclinical. Paraclinical and Central Library was shifted by August 1968. Meanwhile, the Silchar Medical College was inaugurated in its permanent building under construction at Ghungoor on 15 August 1968 and thereby the twin got separated. Dr. Rudra Goswami was put in charge of the Silchar Medical College. In September 1968 the permanent building of the Gauhati Medical College under process of construction was inaugurated by the Governor of Assam Mr. B.K. Nehru. On 20 September 1968 the Chief Minister of Assam Mr. B.P. Chaliha laid the foundation stone of the hospital by the side of the college main building at Narakachal hill. However, the construction had to be abandoned because of the presence of large rocks. As stone breaking and clearing would incur massive expenditure the state government decided to shift the hospital construction to the foot hill of Narakachal. The foundation stone was laid down on 15 August 1975 by Shri Sarat Ch. Sinha, the Chief Minister of Assam. The new hospital at its permanent site at the Narakachal foot hill started functioning in 1984. In February 1969, postgraduate courses started in Anatomy, Physiology, Biochemistry, Pathology, Pharmacology, Community Medicine, Medicine, Surgery, Ophthalmology and Otorhinolaryngology. The General Medical Council of the UK recognised the bachelor's degree of the college in 1969, thereby enabling the graduates to pursue higher studies in that country. Courses The university offers a -year MBBS degree, which includes a one-year internship. It also offers both degree MD/MS (3-year) and Diploma (2-year) postgraduate medical courses. DM and Mch courses are also offered. Student activities =Junior Doctors' Association= The Junior Doctors' Association is the representative of the postgraduate students and the internees. =Students' Union= Gauhati Medical College Students Union is the representative body of the students. It was formed in 1961. Currently student politics is rather non existent in the college.

Built in 1860, it is historically significant for its association with the Carnegie Endowment, whose headquarters it was from its founding in 1910 until 1948. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and It has since been incorporated into the Blair House complex serving high-profile official visitors to the capital. Description and history The Peter Parker House stands at the southern end of Jackson Place, presenting a side to Pennsylvania Avenue, across from Lafayette Square. It is one of a series of relatively modest Italianate row houses built out of brick. It is three stories in height, crowned by an elaborate projecting wooden cornice. It is three bays wide, with its entrance in the rightmost bay accessed by a low flight of stairs. The entrance is framed by a sandstone segmental-arch pediment with brackets. Window sills and lintels, as well as corner quoining, are also sandstone. The house was built in 1860. Its first prominent resident was Peter Parker, best known as a medical missionary to China. Contrary to popular belief, the house has no connection to the Peter Parker of Spider-Man. In 1910 it was acquired by the recently founded Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Funded by philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, he established it as a vehicle to promote and seek and end to international warfare. The organization occupied this building as its headquarters until 1948, when it moved to New York City. During its tenure, the organization also acquired the adjacent buildings (704 and 708 Jackson Place), and expanded into them. From 1961 to 1965 it housed the Civil War Centennial Commission, and by 1970 it had been purchased by the federal government. In the early 1980s, it along with 704 Jackson Place were internally combined into a single building and then merged with Blair House by way of a connecting structure occupying the alleyway that had separated them.

Fairweather also described Gabriel Kapris (the Minister for Commerce and Industry, who was present) as a stil-man, a Tok Pisin word for a thief. Amet responded by calling Fairweather, who is white, \\"a white millionaire that the people do not need\\", telling him: \\"You pack up and you leave my island. [...] You don't belong here\\". He added that a white person could never understand the country, and thus could not provide the services that the people needed. (This was disputed by villagers, who pointed out that, under Fairweather, they had benefited from new school facilities, roads, and a greater access to water supplies.) The exchange, which had been filmed, was posted on YouTube, and made front page news in the Post-Courier, the country's largest-selling daily newspaper. The paper described Amet's words as \\"shamefully wrong and unbecoming of a state minister, especially coming from the former Chief Justice of Papua New Guinea\\". In response, Amet \\"took out a full page advertisement\\" in the paper, in which he apologised to Fairweather and the people of Madang \\"for [his] unbecoming racial and abusive comments and behaviour\\".\\"Madang PMIZ debate turns sour\\" , Post-Courier, 2 May 2011\\"Amet talk upsets islanders\\" , Post-Courier, 3 May 2011\\"Saying sorry is not hard\\" , Post-Courier, 9 May 2011Video of part of the exchange between Amet and Fairweather, SoulPNG channel, YouTube, 30 April 2011 References Category:Chief justices of Papua New Guinea Category:Governors of Madang Province Category:People from Madang Province Category:Members of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea Category:Government ministers of Papua New Guinea Category:Living people Category:National Alliance Party (Papua New Guinea) politicians Category:1952 births ","title":"Arnold Amet"},{"id":"17352869","text":"In the field of criminal law, there are a variety of conditions that will tend to negate elements of a crime (particularly the intent element), known as defenses. The label may be apt in jurisdictions where the accused may be assigned some burden before a tribunal. However, in many jurisdictions, the entire burden to prove a crime is on the prosecution, which also must prove the absence of these defenses, where implicated. In other words, in many jurisdictions the absence of these so-called defenses is treated as an element of the crime. So-called defenses may provide partial or total refuge from punishment. Types of defenses = Mental Disorder (Insanity) = William Hogarth's A Rake's Progress, depicting the world's oldest psychiatric hospital, Bethlem Hospital Insanity or mental disorder (Australia and Canada), may negate the intent of any crime, although it pertains only to those crimes having an intent element. A variety of rules have been advanced to define what, precisely, constitutes criminal insanity. The most common definitions involve either an actor's lack of understanding of the wrongfulness of the offending conduct, or the actor's inability to conform conduct to the law.M'Naghten's case (1843) 10 C & F 200, where a man suffering extreme paranoia believed the Tory party of the United Kingdom, were persecuting him. He wanted to shoot and kill Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel, but got Peel's secretary in the back instead. Mr M'Naghten was found to be insane, and instead of prison, put in a mental hospital. The case produced the rules that a person is presumed to be sane and responsible, unless it is shown that (1) he was labouring under such a defect of reason (2) from disease of the mind (3) as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong. These elements must be proven present on the balance of probabilities. \\"Defect of reason\\" means much more than, for instance, absent mindedness making a lady walk from a supermarket without paying for a jar of mincemeat. R v. Clarke [1972] 1 All ER 219, caused by diabetes and depression, but the lady pleaded guilty because she did not want to defend herself as insane. Her conviction was later quashed. A \\"disease of the mind\\" includes not just brain diseases, but any impairment \\"permanent or transient and intermittent\\" so long as it is not externally caused (e.g. by drugs) and it has some effect on one's mind. R v. Sullivan [1984] AC 156. So epilepsy can count, as can an artery problem causing temporary loss of consciousness (and a man to attack his wife with a hammer). R v. Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399. Diabetes may cause temporary \\"insanity\\" R v. Hennessy [1989] 2 All ER 9; though see R v. Quick [1973] and the automatism defense. and even sleep walking has been deemed \\"insane\\".R v. Burgess [1991] 2 All ER 769 \\"Not knowing the nature or wrongness of an act\\" is the final threshold which confirms insanity as related to the act in question. In R v. Windle R v. Windle 1952 2 QB 826 a man helped his wife commit suicide by giving her a hundred aspirin. He was in fact mentally ill, but as he recognised what he did and that it was wrong by saying to police \\"I suppose they will hang me for this\\", he was found not insane and guilty of murder. Mr Windle was not hanged! If one succeeds in being declared \\"not guilty by reason of insanity,\\" then the result frequently is treatment in a mental hospital, although some jurisdictions provide the sentencing authority with flexibility.E.g. in the U.K. Criminal Procedure (Insanity and Unfitness to Plead) Act 1991, giving the judge discretion to impose hospitalisation, guardianship, supervision and treatment or discharge. As further described in articles available online. =Automatism= Automatism is a state where the muscles act without any control by the mind, or with a lack of consciousness.Bratty v. Attorney-General for Northern Ireland [1963] AC 386R v Falconer [1990] HCA 49; (1990) 171 CLR 30 (22 November 1990) One may suddenly fall ill, into a dream like state as a result of post traumatic stress,R v. T [1990] Crim LR 256 or even be \\"attacked by a swarm of bees\\" and go into an automatic spell.see Kay v. Butterworth (1945) 61 TLR 452 However, to be classed as an \\"automaton\\" means there must have been a total destruction of voluntary control, which does not include a partial loss of consciousness as the result of driving for too long.Attorney-General's Reference (No. 2 of 1992) [1993] 4 All ER 683 Where the onset of loss of bodily control was blameworthy, e.g., the result of voluntary drug use, it may be a defense only to specific intent crimes.R v. Hardie [1984] 1 WLR 64. Mr Hardie took his girlfriend's valium, because she had just kicked him out and he was depressed. She encouraged him to take them, to make him feel better. But he got angry and set fire to the wardrobe. It was held that he should not be convicted of arson because he expected the valium to calm him down, and this was its normal effect. Examples of this would be provocation, intoxication and mental illness, provocation means the victim provoked the defendant with illegal behavior, therefore, the defendant lost self control and attacked the victim. Therefore, a criminal defense lawyer would argue that the victim should not have said or done certain illegal actions that would make someone lose self control. Intoxication is where the defendant was unaware of their action s due to being under the influence of certain drugs or alcoholic beverages. Therefore a criminal defense lawyer might be able to argue a good case, depending on what was used and if there was a party. Mental illness is where the defendant has a certain mental condition that makes them incapable of understanding right and wrong. A good case would be dementia, schizophrenia, etc. a criminal defense lawyer would be able to argue a good case, if evidence of disability papers are there. =Intoxication= Michelangelo In some jurisdictions, intoxication may negate specific intent, a particular kind of mens rea applicable only to some crimes. For example, lack of specific intent might reduce murder to manslaughter. Voluntary intoxication nevertheless often will provide basic intent, e.g., the intent required for manslaughter.DPP v. Majewski 1977 AC 433, where M was drunk and drugged and attacked people in a pub. He had no defense to assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In R v. Sheehan and Moore two viciously drunken scoundrels threw petrol on a tramp and set fire to him. They got off for murder, but still went down for manslaughter, since that is a crime of basic intent. Of course, it can well be the case that someone is not drunk enough to support any intoxication defense at all. R v. Gallagher [1963] AC 349. On the other hand, involuntarily intoxication, for example by punch spiked unforeseeably with alcohol, may give rise to no inference of basic intent. Strictly speaking, however, it could be argued that intoxication is not a defense, but a denial of mens rea;[2009] Crim L.R. 3 the main difference being that a defense accepts the mens rea and actus reus of an offence are present. With intoxication, there is no acceptance of the mens rea of the offence. For offences of basic intent, the act itself is criminalised. All that is needed is the intent to do the act. It can therefore be inferred that there is such intent relatively easily; when intoxicated one is not an automaton - there is still control of one's actions. Therefore, intoxication will rarely (if ever) deny the mens rea of crimes of basic intent. With specific intent, the character of the act is criminalised, for the act itself is often objectively innocent. Appropriation of an item is perfectly innocent, yet when one appropriates with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it, there is a theft. This is much more difficult to prove beyond reasonable doubt, for an intoxicated person may exercise control over his actions but will often lack an understanding of what is being done - without this understanding the necessary intent cannot be proven. Therefore, whilst it is tempting to think of intoxication as a defense, it is more accurate to see it as a denial of the mens rea of an offence - where the mens rea or actus reus is not proven, there is no need for defenses. =Mistake Of Fact= \\"I made a mistake\\" is a defense in some jurisdictions if the mistake is about a fact and is genuine.DPP v Morgan [1976] AC 182, where an RAF man told three officers to have sex with his wife and she would pretend to refuse just to be stimulating. They pleaded mistake, and the jury did not believe them. The defense is most often used in conjunction with another defense, where the mistake led the defendant to believe that their actions were justifiable under the second defense. For example, a charge of assault on a police officer may be negated by genuine (and perhaps reasonable) mistake of fact that the person the defendant assaulted was a criminal and not an officer, thus allowing a defense of use of force to prevent a violent crime (generally part of self-defense/defense of person).R v Williams [1987] 3 All ER 411 =Necessity/Lesser harm= An overarching theory of criminal defenses is the doctrine of necessity. Generally speaking, a criminal act can be justifiable if it is necessary to prevent a foreseeable and greater harm than the harm created by the act. For instance, trespassing is generally justified if the defendant only trespassed in order to, for instance, instantaneously attempt to put out a fire on the property, or to rescue someone drowning in a pool on the property. The destruction or death caused by following the law and not trespassing would have been far greater than the harm caused by trespassing. Similarly, most laws forbidding the discharge of firearms in public contain an exception for emergency or defensive use. Necessity generally forms the basis for many other defenses and their favor, such as capacity of office, legal duty, and self-defense. =Lawful Capacity of Office= This defense is generally available to public servants and first responders, such as police officers, firefighters, EMTs, etc. It usually protects the first responder from responsibility for otherwise criminal actions that the first responder must perform as an appointed agent of the jurisdiction in the course and scope of their duties. For example, a paramedic who forcibly enters a house or building in answer to an emergency call cannot be charged with breaking and entering. A judge who sentences a man to die for a crime cannot be charged with attempted murder if the convicted man is later exonerated. Such protection is generally limited to acts required in the course and scope of employment, and it does not preclude gross negligence or malicious intent. Legal Duty This \\"lawful capacity of office\\" defense can also apply to civilians who do not hold such a position, but whose assistance is requested by someone who does, such as a police officer. A person who witnesses a criminal being chased by police who yell \\"stop that man!\\", and obliges resulting in injury to the criminal, cannot be charged with assault or sued for personal injury. \\"Good Samaritan\\" laws generally provide immunity in civil and criminal proceedings to persons who, in good faith, cause injury while attempting to help a person in distress, protecting such persons even in cases where greater harm resulted from the action than would have occurred otherwise. =Self defense= Self-defense is, in general, some reasonable action taken in protection of self. An act taken in self-defense often is not a crime at all; no punishment will be imposed. To qualify, any defensive force must be proportionate to the threat. Use of a firearm in response to a non-lethal threat is a typical example of disproportionate force; however, such decisions are dependent on the situation and the applicable law, and thus the example situation can in some circumstances be defensible, Generally because of a codified presumption intended to prevent the unjust negation of this defense by the trier of fact. =Duress= One who is \\"under duress\\" is forced into an unlawful act. Duress can be a defense in many jurisdictions, although not for the most serious crimes of murder,People v. Anderson, 8 Cal. 4th 767, 50 P.3d 368, 122 Cal. Rptr. 2d 587 (2002) (noting that according to Blackstone, duress was not an available defense to murder at common law and holding that is still current law in California). attempted murder, being an accessory to murderc.f. DPP for Northern Ireland v. Lynch [1975] 1 All ER 913, the old English rule whereby duress was available for a secondary party to murder; see now R v. Howe [1987] 1 AC 417, where the defendant helped torture, sexually abuse and strangling. and in many countries, treason.This strict rule has been upheld in relation to a sixteen-year-old boy told by his father to stab his mother. R v. Gotts [1992] 2 AC 412, convicted for attempted murder. The duress must involve the threat of imminent peril of death or serious injury, operating on the defendant's mind and overbearing his will.R v. Abdul-Hussain [1999] Crim LR 570, where two Shiites escaped from persecution in Iraq by going to Sudan and hijacking a plane. The threat was not imminent but \\"hanging over them\\" so they were not convicted. Threats to third persons may qualify.E.g., family, R v. Martin [1989], close friends, or under certain circumstances, car passengers, R v. Conway [1988] 3 All ER 1025 The defendant must reasonably believe the threat,n.b. this may differ to the state of mind in the case of mistake, where the only requirement is that one honestly believes something. Here it may need to be a \\"reasonable belief\\", see also R v. Hasan (formerly Z) [2005] UKHL 22 and there is no defense if \\"a sober person of reasonable firmness, sharing the characteristics of the accused\\" would have responded differently.R v. Graham [1982], where duress was rejected Age, pregnancy, physical disability, mental illness, sexuality have been considered, although basic intelligence has been rejected as a criterion.R v. Bowen [1996] The accused must not have foregone some safe avenue of escape.R v. Gill [1963], where someone told to steal a lorry could have raised the alarm; see also R v. Hudson and Taylor [1971] where two teenage girls were scared into perjuring, and not convicted because their age was relevant and police protection not always seen to be safe. The duress must have been an order to do something specific, so that one cannot be threatened with harm to repay money and then choose to rob a bank to repay it.R v. Cole [1994] If one puts themselves in a position where they could be threatened, duress may not be a viable defense.See R v. Sharp [1987]. But see R v. Shepherd [1987] =Impossibility defense= An impossibility defense is a criminal defense occasionally used when a defendant is accused of a criminal attempt that failed only because the crime was factually or legally impossible to commit. =Consent= In law, consent can be a full or partial defense to certain types of crimes. It tends to be an absolute defense if no permanent harm resulted, and otherwise may be a partial defense. An example is the rough sex murder defense.

Indigenous Multnomah people established villages on nearby Sauvie Island but not in the swampy area along the Balch Creek side of the river in what later became northwest Portland. The lake was at an elevation of above sea level between what later became Northwest Saint Helens Road and Northwest Yeon Street, slightly west of Northwest 35th Avenue in the Northwest Industrial district of Portland.Modern location derived via Google Earth from Geographic Names Information System coordinates. The lake took its name from Peter Guild (pronounced guile), one of the first 19th-century settlers in the area. In 1847, he acquired nearly of the wetlands through a donation land claim. After Guild's death in 1870, various landowners modified the area to accommodate sawmills, railroads, shipping docks, and Portland's city garbage incinerator. The Guild's Lake Rail Yard, built by the Northern Pacific Railway in the 1880s, became an important switching yard for trains. Beginning in the 1890s, channel-deepening in the Willamette River improved the city's status as a deep-water seaport, as did completion in 1914 of a port terminal. These developments helped make nearby Guild's Lake the most important industrial area in Portland. In 1905, the Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition, held on an artificial island in Guild's Lake, had helped spur growth in the area. After the exposition ended, developers filled the lake and its surrounds with rocks and gravel sluiced from parts of the Balch Creek watershed in the West Hills above the floodplain or dredged from the Willamette River. Civic leaders promoted the Guild's Lake area as a good place for industry, and by the mid-1920s the lake was gone. Instead, it became \\"a drying and settling mud flat ... awaiting development during World War II\\". During World War II, the Guild's Lake Housing Project, an adjunct to the Vanport project, provided temporary housing for workers in the nearby Kaiser Shipyards. After the war, chemical and petroleum processing and storage, metals manufacturing, and other large industries expanded in the area. In 2001, the Portland City Council adopted the Guild's Lake Industrial Sanctuary Plan aimed at protecting the area's \\"long-term economic viability as an industrial district.\\" See also * List of lakes in Oregon References External links * Guild's Lake in The Oregon Encyclopedia Category:History of Portland, Oregon Category:Lakes of Oregon Category:Former lakes Category:World's fair sites in the United States Category:Lakes of Multnomah County, Oregon ","title":"Guild's Lake"},{"id":"17352976","text":"The Zalmon Richards House is a historic house in Washington, D.C.. A Second Empire rowhouse, it was home from 1882 until his death of Zalmon Richards (1811-1899), founder of the National Education Association. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1965. and It is a private residence. Description and history The Zalmon Richards House stands in Washington's Logan Circle neighborhood, on the north side of Corcoran Street NW between 13th and 14th Streets. It is at the right end of a series of Victorian brick row houses which line the street. It is 2-1/2 stories in height with a raised basement, and a mansard roof providing a full third floor in the attic level. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance recessed under a round- arch opening in the leftmost bay. On the first floor, the right two bays are taken up by a polygonal wood-frame window bay with a bracketed roof. Second- floor windows are set in segmented-arch openings crowned by a decorative hoods with drip moulding. The right wall of the building has a projecting oriel window with styling similar to the front bay. The building's builder and construction date are not known. The house was purchased in 1882 by Zalmon Richards. He was by then already prominent in education circles, serving as founder and first president of the National Teachers Association, now the National Education Association. Raised and educated in Massachusetts, Richards embarked on a teaching career at the age of seventeen, and organized teachers at virtually every major posting he held.

Although it lack(ed) a major public transit system,((now a metro rail project is commissioned and operational)) its road network is well-maintained to avoid congestion. Nagpur is connected to India's four major metropolitan areas (Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai) by road, rail and air. Auto rickshaws operate in most parts of the city, and are the main form of hired transport.  Roads  Nagpur is a major road junction, since India's two major national highways (NH 7 from Kanyakumari to Varanasi and NH-6 from Hajira to Kolkota) pass through the city. NH 69 connects Nagpur to Obaidullaganj, near Bhopal. Nagpur is at the junction of two Asian Highways: AH43 (Agra to Matara, Sri Lanka) and AH46 (Kharagpur to Dhule). The Inland Container Depot, run by Container Corporation of India (CONCOR), has been the country's fastest- growing inland port. The Mumbai‚ÄìAurangabad‚ÄìNagpur highway, a Maharashtra state highway, connects the state capital (Mumbai) to Nagpur via Aurangabad and significantly reduces the distance traveled by NH 6 and NH 3 between the cities. The National Highways Authority of India approved the extension of NH 204 from Kolhapur to Nagpur via Solapur, Tuljapur, Latur, Nanded, Yavatmal, Wardha and Butibori, which primarily covers the portion covered by the current MSH 3 between Butibori and Tuljapur. The planned NH-26B (Savner-Chhindwara- Narsinghpur) will connect Nagpur to North India. = Buses = Intercity Nagpur is the divisional headquarters of the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation (MSRTC), and has one of the state's three bus workshops. The MSRTC has intercity and interstate routes, with two bus stations in Nagpur: Nagpur Bus Sthanak (CBS-1) at Ganeshpeth and Mor Bhawan (CBS-2) at Jhansi Rani Square, Sitabuldi. It operates 1,600 daily long- and short-distance routes from CBS-1 in Maharashtra and surrounding states, and 750 daily short-distance routes from CBS-2 in Vidarbha. Buses include semi- luxury 2+2 NEEM AARAAM, Parivartan 2+2, Asiad 2+2, and ordinary ST 2+3. Bus service is available to major cities in and around the state, including Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Raipur, Satna, Rewa, Raipur, Panna, Amravati, Raipur, Jagdalpur, Bilaspur, Mandla, Katni, Pune, Aurangabad, Jalna, Nashik, Mumbai, Nanded, Akola, Jalgaon, Bhusawal, Rajnandgaon, Parbhani and Gondia.  City  StarBus in Nagpur Nagpur Mahanagar Parivahan Limited (NMPL) is the company which operates the city's bus service. It has a fleet of 487 buses, which serve about 160,000 passengers daily in the metropolitan area. Of the fleet, 17 are electric buses; 88 are low-floor MiniBuses, and 382 are low- floor 50-seat StarBuses.  Railways  Due to its central location, Nagpur is a rail junction connecting India's four major metropolises: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, and Kolkata. A total of 242 trains (passenger, express, mail, Duronto, Rajdhani Express and the Garib Rath) stop at Nagpur, one of the country's busiest junctions. Sixty-five are daily trains, and 26 terminate or originate at Nagpur. Almost 150,000 passengers use the Nagpur Junction railway station, the city's main station, daily; smaller stations are at Ajni, Itwari, Kalamna, Kamptee and Khapri. A need has been felt for a Nagpur metro rail service similar to the Delhi Metro, and Larsen and Toubro (L&T;) was commissioned to prepare a report on the metropolitan area's transport needs by 2020. In its report, L&T; recommended an elevated monorail and a multi-modal transport system similar to Hyderabad's. The consultants suggested a minimum of 1,500 city buses and a bus rapid transit system (BRTS) on selected routes. Nagpur Junction (built in 1867) is in the center of the city, at the foot of Sitabuldi Hill which contains the historic fort. It is the headquarters of the Nagpur division of the central and south-eastern lines of Indian Railways. The nearby Ajni station is primarily a cargo terminal. British India opened the Bombay‚ÄìBhusawal‚ÄìNagpur line in 1867 to link the cotton-growing Vidarbha region with the port city of Bombay. The line was later extended east to Howrah. The main building is pink sandstone, similar to the colonial-era Reserve Bank of India and Vidhan Bhavan, and is a heritage site. The Ministry of Railways has allocated to upgrade the station, and a flyover has been built to reduce traffic congestion. The Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN) is under construction, and closed-circuit cameras have been installed at Nagpur Junction. In addition to Nagpur Junction, local stations are in Itwari, Ajni, Kalamna, Khapri, Godhni, Bharatwada, Gumgaon, Kapmtee, Kanhan, Ramtek and Butibori. Itwari has been converted to a terminus by the South East Central Railway for many passenger and local MEMU trains. Local trains run from Itwari to Nagpur's outlying north, north-east and eastern areas, and the Ramtek-Kanhan-Kamptee-Kalamna-Itwari line is popular with pilgrims. Many passenger trains to Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Raipur, Gondia and Tatanagar originate in Nagpur. The Itwari line is also used by business people from north, north-east and eastern Nagpur. Ajni, on the Nagpur-Mumbai/Chennai route, is part of the Central Railway zone. Nearly all trains stop briefly at the station, which is used primarily by residents of central, western, south- western and southern Nagpur and short-distance day trippers. Trains terminating at Nagpur are almost 80 percent emptied at Ajni, and trains originating from the city fill about 40 percent there. = Nagpur Metro = The Nagpur Metro project was announced by the Maharashtra state government, with a cost of () for a phase-1, 25-km corridor from Sitabuldi to MIHAN and Butibori via Airport, and () for a 20-km corridor from Sitabuldi to Automotive Square in Kamptee.TOI NEWS - Dated: 22 Dec 2011 Consultant Delhi Metro Railway Corporation (DMRC) would study the alignment and submit a detailed project report.TOI NEWS - Dated: Dec 23, 2011 Site inspection began in March 2012 with a Nagpur Improvement Trust (NIT) initiative.

Domestic airlines Indigo, kingfisher Airlines, GoAir, and Air Deccan connect Nagpur with Mumbai (eight flights daily), Delhi (four flights daily), Ahemdabad (two flights daily), Pune (two flights daily), Bangalore (two flights daily) Indore (three flights daily), Hyderabad (three flights daily, and one flight four times a week), and Kolkata (one flight daily and one flight twice a week). Indigo has announced plans for direct service between Nagpur and Chennai. In October 2005, Nagpur's Sonegaon Airport was declared an international airport and renamed Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport. Initial Air Arabia flights between Nagpur and Sharjah intended to tap a strong demand for international travel in Central India. In April 2006, Indian Airlines connected Nagpur and Bangkok with non-stop, twice- weekly service. Qatar Airways began twice-weekly service from Nagpur to Doha, and Air India Express began flying to Dubai three times a week on 24 September 2007. = MIHAN = The Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport at Nagpur (MIHAN), India's first, was completed on the outskirts of the city in 2006. MIHAN is expected to contribute significantly to the development of Nagpur and the economically-backward Vidarbha region. Another impetus to the budding aviation industry in Nagpur was Boeing's decision to set up a $185-million maintenance base in 2006.

It was one of the biggest prisons in Europe until its closure in 1998. The structure followed the panopticon model devised by Jeremy Bentham in 1785. History During caudillo Francisco Franco's Spanish State (1936‚Äì1975) the prison hosted a large community of political prisoners, which included members of socialist, anarchist, communist and marxist political parties and union leaders. Notable inmates included Marcelino Camacho (leader of the Communist clandestine union Comisiones Obreras) and the rest of top-rank members of it imprisoned as a result of the Process 1001, Juli√°n Ariza (member also of the same union), Nicol√°s Redondo (leader of Workers' General Union), Eduardo Saborido, Sim√≥n S√°nchez Montero (Communist leader, who served 25 years in prison),Una placa conmemorativa en la antigua c√°rcel de Carabanchel recordar√° a las v√≠ctimas de la represi√≥n franquista, Europa Press, 21 June 2008.

After Franco's death, only common criminals and members of the Basque separatist group ETA and other paramilitary groups remained. After its abandonment, the building was heavily looted and was inhabited by marginal communities. Most of the prison walls were covered with graffiti, some of them very elaborate. A lengthy debate took place between the neighbours from Carabanchel and Aluche, who wanted a hospital and other public facilities to be built in the area,The neighbours' project for the prison lot and the local authorities, who want to privatize the land for housing development. The neighbours also wanted part of the prison to be preserved. Finally in July 2008, local and national government reached an agreement on the future of the prison lot, projecting to build 650 apartments, a hospital, green zones and government buildings on the former prison grounds.

These cats are of medium size with a longish body, appearing both muscular and slender. They have soft, elastic skin; an excess of which leads to a wrinkled appearance. The breed is not recognized by any major, international cat fancier and breeder organizations, only Ukrainian and Russian clubs. The Levkoy's peculiar features are: special angular contour of its head and \\"stepped\\" profile (dog-face appearance), folded ears and large, but not wide almond-shaped eyes. The cats express sexual dimorphism.RUI - Breed and colors Origin The Ukrainian Levkoy is recent man-made breed (2000‚Äì2011), originally developed by Elena Biriukova in Ukraine. Created by crossing or by outbreeding hairless Donskoy females with Scottish Fold metis males, the Ukrainian Levkoy has a distinct and unique appearance. Two spontaneous mutations of dominant FD genes of cats with folded ears (that appeared in a simple domestic cat in Scotland) were used, as well as a spontaneous natural dominant mutation of hairlessness or baldness of the domestic cat gene BD in Russia. Both had appeared in the last century in Scotland and in Russia. Oriental and Domestic cats were also used in mating to obtain the required individual characteristics of the Ukrainian Levkoy. The breed was recognized in 2005 in Ukraine by ICFA RUI (Rolandus Union International). It was recognized in Russia in 2010 by ICFA WCA. In the Ukraine, starting in September 2010, it was deemed that Ukrainian Levkoys may be awarded the title of \\"Champion\\" and that they may take part in \\"The Best in Show\\" competition. Nowadays there are 10 Ukrainian Levkoys who are given these titles. In Russia the first titles of \\"Champion\\" and \\"The Best in Show\\" were given in 2011. The other organizations are mating this new breed of Ukrainian Levkoy as an experimental breed without the \\"Champion\\" title at cats exhibitions. This breed will never be recognized in FIFe. Personality Ukrainian Levkoys are friendly, playful, and intelligent cats. Levkoys are very sociable, enjoying human or family company as well as the company of other domestic pets (e.g., dogs, rats, pigs). Unclothed Ukrainian Levkoys do not need brushing but do need special skin care to give protection against direct sun and particularly cold conditions. Development and appearance From the top view the head of a Ukrainian Levkoy resembles a soft outlined pentagon that is a little longer than it is broad, where the muzzle length is only 1/3 the length of the head. The forehead is rather low and the skull is long and flat. Prominent cheekbones and eyebrows form angular outlines of the head. The profile of the cat head is \\"stepped\\" of two levels. The upper lines of the nose bridge and of the head are almost parallel. The whiskers are curly, may be shortly snapped, and then the neck is of medium length, muscular, and slightly arches from the shoulder to the base of the skull. Its body is medium to long, muscular, and slender. The back line slightly arched with a broad, oval chest. Its legs are rather long with long mobile toes. The ears are large and set high and wide apart. 1/2 to 1/3 of each ear is roundly folded forward and down, without touching the head.The remarkable about Ukrainian Levkoys is that, when breeding according to the breeding guide, one of the parents must have normal straight ears. The other parent must have folded ears since their genotype has the dominant FD gene in its heterozygous form too. All straight eared kittens do not have any dominant FD gene. The straight variety of the Ukrainian Levkoy is the complemented and necessary partner of the breed. (See similar trait characteristics in the Scottish Fold) Defects and disqualification Gene FD is evident in the organism of the cat in homozygous, both parents may serve as provocation of bones illness such arthritis or the others bones mistakes. Disqualification results due to defects of the born structures, or crossed eyes. Other disqualify in accordance with the show rules. For example, too short or round of a head, round eyes, short \\"cobby\\" body, weak chin, or stressful behavior. Litter The average litter size is generally three to five kittens.

Early life and career Born in Springfield, Ohio, McCullough met his future partner Bobby Clark in elementary school. The two became friends and attended tumbling classes at a local YMCA together. Their childhood friendship grew into an adult partnership when they decided to pursue a career as a comedic duo. Billing themselves as \\"Clark and McCullough\\", they began their career performing in minstrel shows in the early 1900s. From 1906 to 1912, the pair performed in circuses before entering vaudeville in 1912. Due to the White Rats strike of 1916, Clark and McCullough were forced to enter into the burlesque circuit to continue working. During their time in burlesque, the duo would create some of their most well known sketches. In their act, Clark was the dominant, motor-mouthed jokester while McCullough was the quieter straight man. In 1922, the team achieved mainstream stardom in Irving Berlin's Broadway show Music Box Revue. They went on to appear in the Broadway hit The Ramblers, which was filmed as the musical comedy The Cuckoos (1930), a vehicle for Wheeler & Woolsey. In mid-1928, Clark and McCullough moved to Hollywood where they signed with Fox Films Corporation for a reported $8,000 a week. The studio hoped the duo's stage popularity would transition to films and set about casting them in a series of two-reel comedy shorts known as The Clark & McCullough Comedies. In many of their films, McCullough's input was severely limited to a supporting role as Clark's antics generated the bulk of the humor. Their occupations in the films usually dictated what Clark's character name was: when photographers, such as in Alibi Bye Bye, Clark was named \\"Flash\\"; when chefs, Clark was \\"Cook\\"; when lawyers, Clark was \\"Blackstone\\", etc. According to the July 1931 issue of Picture Play magazine, the shorts were poorly received by critics and audiences alike. Around the Fox studio lot, the duo's film series were mockingly referred to as The Clark and McCullough Tragedies. After filming fourteen shorts, Fox dropped Clark and McCullough in early 1929. In 1930, the duo signed with RKO Radio Pictures. They would go on to make twenty-two comedy shorts for RKO over the next five years. As with their Fox shorts, the duo's comedy did not transition well into the medium of film and was poorly received by critics and audiences. RKO attempted to remedy this by hiring big name directors and granting bigger budgets, but the shorts continued to be panned. Director Sam White, who directed three of Clark and McCullough's RKO shorts, later said that the duo's film career stalled because, on film, \\"...Bobby came across as annoying. Clark was one of those comedians who had to be seen live. In pictures, he was flat.\\" Clark and McCullough's final film for RKO was Alibi Bye Bye (1935). Death After shooting their last film in 1935, Clark and McCullough toured the country in a revue of Thumbs Up. After that tour was completed, they signed on as the lead act of an East Coast touring production of the George White Scandals. In early 1936, before production was set to begin, Bobby Clark returned to his wife in New York for a short rest while McCullough traveled to Massachusetts. He then checked himself into the New England Sanitarium in Stoneham for what was later described as \\"nervous exhaustion\\". Upon his release on March 23, McCullough's friend Frank T. Ford picked him up to drive him to the home he shared with his wife in Brookline. As McCullough and Ford drove through the town of Medford, McCullough asked Ford to stop at a local barbershop as he wanted to get a shave. While Ford waited in the car, McCullough entered the barbershop and ordered a shave. He casually chatted with the barber during his shave. After the shave was completed, McCullough grabbed the barber's razor and cut his throat from ear to ear and slashed his wrists. He was rushed to Lawrence Memorial Hospital where he died on March 25. McCullough's funeral was held on March 28 in Brookline. He is interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in Everett, Massachusetts. The reason for McCullough's suicide remains a mystery. Upon learning of his partner's death, Clark publicly stated: \\"I think it was just something Paul couldn't help. Something that had been with him all the time and he didn't even know it.\\" After several months of seclusion, Clark returned to performing as a solo act and would continue to perform until his death in 1960.

He has been a Member of Parliament since September 2008, was a member of Cabinet for most of the period from December 2010 to January 2012 and then from March 2013 to June 2015, and was the Director of the Vanuatu National Cultural Council from 1995 until December 2010. He has been a leading figure in Vanuatu's cultural world, primarily as a promoter of cultural knowledge preservation and sustainable development as a researcher, but also, to a lesser extent, as a painter and illustrator. He has represented Vanuatu and its culture in the international sphere, notably through UNESCO. His transition to politics came suddenly in 2008, at a comparatively young age; his successful campaign to be elected to Parliament generated popular and media support. As a Member of Parliament, he sought to publicise his activities and discuss political issues directly with members of the public; he also used his parliamentary allowance to help finance student scholarships and youth business projects. Three months after his election, he was arrested and charged with aiding prisoners who had escaped from gaol. The charges were later dropped. In late 2010, he launched his own political party, shortly before being appointed to Cabinet. From December 2017 to April 2020, he served as Vanuatu's Minister for Foreign Affairs, and sought in particular to mobilise the international community in support for the right to self- determination for the people of West Papua. Since April 2020, he has been Leader of the Opposition in Parliament.

Caracasses is leader of the Green Confederation, and was -in the immediate aftermath of the election- whip of the parliamentary Opposition to Prime Minister Edward Natapei's government. The press initially described Regenvanu as being a member of the Opposition.\\"MPs to challenge any motion to suspend them\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 17 January 2009 Following a Cabinet reshuffle in November 2009, however, he became part of a new parliamentary majority supporting Prime Minister Natapei, as member of \\"The Alliance\\" political bloc headed by Sato Kilman, who was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade in the November Cabinet reshuffle. The Alliance, supporting the government, consisted in MPs from a variety of small parties (including Carcasses' Green Confederation) and three independent MPs.\\"Crack in Alliance\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 4 September 2010 Regenvanu, who did not seek a role in Cabinet, then described himself as a government backbencher;\\"Major reshuffle of Vanuatu's government\\", ABC Radio Australia, 18 November 2009 he was also described as \\"an independent MP in the government coalition\\" and a \\"government MP\\", though he was not a member of Cabinet.\\"Natapei fires NUP, brings in Alliance\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 19 November 2009 In January 2009, he announced that he would use part of his allowance as Member of Parliament to set up and finance scholarships for students undertaking Foundation-level studies at the University of the South Pacific in Port Vila.\\"Regenvanu initiates scholarship scheme for Port Vila USP Foundation students\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 23 January 2009\\"Initiative int√©ressante et originale de Ralph Regenvanu\\", ABC Radio Australia, 9 February 2009 In March, twelve students were selected to receive financial assistance under his scholarship scheme.\\"Twelve selected under Port Vila Scholarship Scheme\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 6 March 2009\\"Regenvanu promotes Second Semester Scholarships\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 16 May 2009 The initiative was praised by the head of the University's Vanuatu campus.\\"Campus Director salutes Regenvanu scholarship initiative\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 24 February 2009 The following year, nineteen more scholarships were awarded under the scheme he was continuing to fund, now with the assistance of an anonymous Australian donor.\\"MP increases scholarships with assistance of investor\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 13 March 2010 The year after that, in 2011, twelve more students received scholarships funded from his allowance.\\"Port Vila Scholarship Scheme phases out to another level\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 7 September 2011 Also in March 2009, Regenvanu began to finance a \\"Youth Solidarity Micro-Credit Scheme\\" out of his parliamentary allocation, providing loans to assist several young people in setting up \\"small business projects\\".\\"Regenvanu dishes out first loan to youths\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 21 March 2009 This was in keeping with his campaign promise that he would attempt to encourage emerging local businesses.\\"Vanuatu: Parlement: derni√®res √©lections\\", Inter-Parliamentary Union He subsequently continued to personally fund programmes from his parliamentary allowance.

He had been invited to participate \\"in recognition of his leading role in building partnerships between Government, research institutions and civil society in Vanuatu\\".\\"MP Regenvanu participates in Australian symposium on the Pacific\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 12 February 2009 Also in February, he criticised what he described as an excessively short period of notice given to MPs before a parliamentary debate on a number of bills: > \\"How is it possible for MPs to consult with their constituencies about the > bills if they have not yet received them less than a week before Parliament > is due to sit to discuss them?

The programme would discuss such issues with guests, as well as with listeners, encouraged to \\"ring in to ask questions or give their views\\". Among the initial topics for discussion were the prospect of Vanuatu joining the World Trade Organization; a fishing plant; and a large loan to Vanuatu from the Chinese government.\\"Port Vila MP to relaunch radio program tonight\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 4 May 2009 \\"Traem Tingting Smol\\" is Bislama for \\"try and think a little\\".\\"Talkback show to tackle tuna processing plants in Port Vila\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 18 May 2009 On 22 May, Regenvanu was publicly criticised and ridiculed in Parliament by Internal Affairs Minister Patrick Crowby and Minister for Lands Harry Iauko, who read out an e-mail Regenvanu had been circulating, in which the young MP broadly accused his fellows of widespread corruption. He had also stated in the e-mail that Speaker of Parliament Maxime Carlot Korman would be \\"buried\\" if he attempted to stand in the 2012 general election. Carlot Korman addressed Regenvanu in these terms: \\"I, along with your father are veteran politicians. I want you to explain to me what you mean when you say you are going to bury me.\\" Regenvanu was compelled by the Speaker to offer an apology.\\"MP Regenvanu forced to apologise over email\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 22 May 2009 In 2010, following a coronial report which accused police commissioner Joshua Bong of human rights abuses, and of attempting to \\"derail the coroner's inquest\\" into a prisoner's death in custody, Regenvanu publicly described Bong as \\"a thug who disregards the law\\", calling for his removal. The same year, Regenvanu was named Vice- Chairman of the Independence Celebrations Task Force Committee, entrusted with preparations for the country's celebration of its anniversary of independence.\\"Independence Committee cancels Independence Ball\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 22 June 2010 He was also a member of the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee investigating a misappropriation of public funds by public servants. The Committee's findings resulted in official charges being laid against three public servants.\\"Public Accounts Com hearing\\", Vantuatu Daily Post, 28 April 2010 In November, he protested publicly against a change in the way constituency funds were allocated to MPs. He argued that, under the new rules, there was no longer any meaningful accountability, as the funds were now to be paid directly into MPs' salaries. Regenvanu argued that this amounted to an unjustified 83% salary increase for MPs. He successfully moved that a nominal vote be taken on the issue, but was one of just seven MPs to vote against what the Daily Post also described as an increase in MPs' salaries.\\"31 MPs vote for pay rise\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 23 November 2010 At the close of 2010, the Fiji-based Islands Business praised him as \\"an outspoken opponent of corruption\\"; \\"in the Public Accounts Committee, he is unflinching in his attempts to wrench the facts from those on the witness stand\\".\\"POLITICS: New party for ‚ÄòMP Ralph‚Äô\\" , Islands Business, December 2010 Alain Simeon, of the Vanuatu Broadcasting and Television Corporation, said of him in January 2012 that he was \\"one of the first MPs to use social media to campaign and to keep voters well informed of political developments\\", adding that he had \\"huge support in the local community\\".\\"Vanuatu Justice Minister sacked\\", ABC Radio Australia, 17 January 2012 =Arrest in December 2008= In December 2008, thirty inmates of Vanuatu‚Äôs main prison in Port Vila escaped after starting a fire in the prison. Regenvanu announced that he had received word in advance of the jailbreak attempt, from the prisoners themselves. He stated that he had found twenty-six of the escaped prisoners and taken them to the National Council of Chiefs's nakamal, where they would be cared for by \\"community leaders\\". He stated that they had been ill-treated while in prison, and that they feared being beaten by prison staff if they returned. The prisoners were re-arrested and taken back to prison. On 19 December, Regenvanu and fellow Member of Parliament Moana Carcasses were arrested, detained for 24 hours, and charged with aiding the prisoners in their escape. Among the charges were \\"harbouring and aiding of prisoners\\", \\"obstructing police on duty\\" and \\"accessory after the fact\\" to the breakout. They were released, provisionally, and appeared in court in February 2009.\\"30 INMATES ESCAPE FROM PORT VILA PRISON\\", Radio New Zealand International, 19 December 2008\\"Carcasses and Regenvanu charged\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 23 December 2008\\"Nouvelles all√©gations dans l‚Äôincendie de la prison de Port Vila\\", ABC Radio Australia, 26 December 2008\\"Deux d√©put√©s du Vanuatu comparaissent aujourd‚Äôhui devant la cour de premi√®re instance\\" , ABC Radio Australia, 6 February 2009\\"Magistrate refuses application to strike out MPs‚Äô case\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 4 February 2009 It was subsequently announced by the Supreme Court that they would face charges of \\"harbouring prisoners\\" and \\"obstructing police duty\\" on 20 March.\\"Moana and Regenvanu court update\\" , Radio Vanuatu Appearing in front of the Supreme Court on that date, Regenvanu pleaded not guilty to \\"three counts of accessory after the fact, harboring or assisting a prisoner and obstructing police officers on duty\\".

They would, in any case, be likely to lose their seats if found guilty.\\"By-elections proving expensive: Tete\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 20 March 2009 In September 2009, the Supreme Court dropped all charges against Regenvanu and Carcasses that had been filed in the wake of the prison break. Despite these events, a Cabinet reshuffle in December 2009 resulted in Carcasses joining Natapei's government as Minister of Internal Affairs and Labour,Composition of Cabinet , on the website of the Parliament of Vanuatu (January 2010) while Regenvanu became \\"an independent MP within the governing coalition\\", supporting Natapei. In May 2010, six escaped prisoners asked to talk to Regenvanu, telling the police they were willing give themselves up if the request were granted. Regenvanu later told the press: > \\"Police came to my house on Sunday at 1pm when I was having my siesta and > told me that the escapees had demanded to see me before they gave themselves > up to the police voluntarily.

The motion was adopted unanimously by Parliament in June, having been moved by the Prime Minister Edward Natapei and seconded by the opposition leader Maxime Carlot Korman, along with their respective parties.\\"Vanuatu to seek observer status for West Papua at MSG and PIF leaders summits\\", Pacific Scoop, 22 June 2010\\"PNG 'out of step' on Papua says Vanuatu MP\\" , Australia Network News, 22 June 2010 The decision received a favourable comment from the monthly Fiji- based regional business magazine Islands Business, which praised it as \\"forward thinking\\", and added: \\"[I]f and when West Papua gets the independence and self rule it deserves, its people will have much to feel grateful to its Melanesian brethren across the Coral Sea\\".\\"WE SAY: Capturing the pan Melanesian spirit\\" , Islands Business, July 2010 Regenvanu subsequently criticised Papua New Guinea for having \\"consistently\\" opposed discussion of West Papua within the Melanesian Spearhead Group, \\"against the wishes of other Melanesian countries\\". Papua New Guinea borders the West Papuan province of Indonesia. He added: \\"We want to raise international attention to the issue of West Papua\\", saying also that he hoped it would not compromise Vanuatu's relations with Indonesia. =Launch of own party= In November 2010, Regenvanu launched his own political party, in preparation for the 2012 general election. The Land and Justice Party (in Bislama, Graon mo Jastis Pati (GJP)) aimed to facilitate young people's participation in politics. Regenvanu argued that the executive of existing parties was controlled by veteran politicians, inhibiting the rise of new, younger politicians. Regenvanu stated that a core objective of the party would be \\"to try and put good leaders into parliament and into politics at all levels. And by that I mean leaders who are prepared to put the public interest first\\". In addition, the party would campaign on strengthening the guarantee of indigenous land ownership, and on promoting and facilitating indigenous participation in business.\\"Regenvanu hopes his new party will drive change in Vanuatu\\", ABC Radio Australia, 17 November 2010 Islands Business expressed its support for the new party. It reported Regenvanu as stating that chiefs, churches, women and youth were the four solid legs of the Land and Justice Party, and added that the party did indeed seem to be supported by youth - but also by \\"mums and dads, chiefs and pastors who have maintained the debate against corruption (and the falling standards in public life), whether in the home, the church or the nakamal, or in print, for a very long time\\". It concluded that Regenvanu was widely \\"seen as a future leader\\" for Vanuatu. =Appointment to Cabinet= Minister for Cooperatives and ni-Vanuatu Business Development In December 2010, Edward Natapei's government was ousted by a motion of no confidence in Parliament, and Sato Kilman succeeded him as Prime Minister. Regenvanu was among those who crossed the floor to form the new parliamentary majority, and consequently obtained a post in Cabinet: Kilman appointed him Minister of Cooperatives and ni-Vanuatu Business Development, issues which Regenvanu's party had stated as priorities.Cabinet of Vanuatu, CIA, 20 December 2010\\"New govt\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 7 December 2010 In early February 2011, he was described as \\"instrumental\\", along with Minister for Trade Ham Lini, in preparing a bill to introduce a Copyright Act in Vanuatu, with an aim to protect the intellectual property of artists.\\"Copyright Act to be gazetted\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 8 February 2011 Later summing up his policies as Minister for ni-Vanuatu Business, he said he had amended the method of appointment of the Registrar of Cooperatives to ensure it would be based on merit. He added that he had formulated a policy to restrict \\"the location and manner in which foreigners could establish retail and wholesale shops in Vanuatu\\", in order to safeguard local businesses, but that he had been reshuffled out of the ministry before it could be implemented.\\"Media Statement From MP Ralph Regenvanu In Response To His Termination As A Minister On Monday 16 January\\", press release, 20 January 2012 Minister for Lands On 18 February, Prime Minister Kilman reshuffled his Cabinet following the defections of two ministers. Regenvanu was appointed Minister for Lands, while backbencher Esmon Sae succeeded him as Minister for ni-Vanuatu business. As Minister for Lands, he was able to initiate a reform of procedures for land leases, which he had been advocating. His ministry announced at the start of March 2011 that \\"new applications for registration of land leases of customary land w[ould now] require consent from an entire landowner clan, not just individuals\\". This would enable greater transparency, and would protect communal landowners from having their lands signed away by a small number of individuals. It would prevent leases \\"that breach planning [or] foreshore requirements\\", and prevent what Transparency International and Oxfam had called \\"corrupt land deals\\" under previous Lands Ministries, whereby (in Regenvanu's words) land was \\"sold for peanuts\\" or by \\"the wrong landowners\\". Three thousand land leases were put on hold for investigation - a decision which was reportedly \\"welcomed by members of the public but [...] prompted legal proceedings against the state by land owners\\". The Opposition, led by Edward Natapei, reacted favourably to Regenvanu's appointment to the Ministry of Lands, saying that, unlike his predecessors, Regenvanu would \\"uphold the legal process in land dealings\\". The Times of Tonga, reprinting an article from the Vanuatu Daily Post, noted: \\"The reshuffling of Port Vila‚Äôs outspoken anti-corruption Minister Ralph Regenvanu, from the Ministry of Ni-Vanuatu Business to the Ministry of Lands comes as a breath of relief and [has been] widely applauded by the grassroots.\\"\\"Vanuatu: Opposition leader urges leaders to follow law in land dealings\\" , Times of Tonga, 5 March 2011 On 10 March, however, Regenvanu was reshuffled to the Ministry of Justice and Social Affairs.\\"Composition du gouvernement de la R√©publique du Vanuatu\\", French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 26 May 2011 Prime Minister Kilman had just sacked Justice Minister Yoan Simon, who had \\"reportedly backed the opposition‚Äôs plans for a motion of no confidence\\" in him, and needed to shore up his coalition government by bringing in a new party. Kilman offered a Cabinet position to the Republican Party, who demanded the Lands Ministry. Consequently, Alfred Carlot replaced Regenvanu as Minister for Lands, while Regenvanu was appointed to the vacant position of Minister for Justice. Ben Bohane, of the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, remarked that Regenvanu seemed to have been \\"sacrificed to allow the [Republican Party] to come in as a coalition partner for the government. The government's numbers are very shaky. Parliament is set to resume some time at the end of this month and again there is ongoing talk of a vote of no confidence.\\" Radio New Zealand International, describing Regenvanu as a reformer during his three weeks as Minister for Lands, noted: \\"Reliable sources from the office of the opposition say Mr Kilman had no choice but to make the reshuffle to stay in power.\\" Radio Australia noted that he had been \\"transferred due to political pressure\\", as the government tried to maintain a viable parliamentary majority. It added that Regenvanu was \\"not happy about leaving before finishing significant changes to the laws on land ownership\\".\\"Lands Minister transferred due to political pressure\\", ABC Radio Australia, 11 March 2011 Carlot said he would continue Regenvanu's reforms aimed at rooting out and prevent corrupt practices. On 20 March, the Vanuatu Daily Post issued an article saying it had \\"seen a number of documents relating to land transactions started by former Minister of Lands Harry Iauko and involving the present MP for Efate Rural, Joshua Kalsakau\\". These documents \\"appear[ed] to explain prima facie why the Labour Party signed or was alleged to have signed the most recent motion of no confidence in Prime Minister Sato Kilman, and why the Labour Party Minister and MPs were subsequently removed from the coalition and the Vanuatu Republican Party brought in, which resulted in the reshuffle of the Ralph Regenvanu from the Lands portfolio\\". Kalsakau, the article said, had applied for a land lease which Iauko, as Minister for Lands, had approved \\"without the normal administrative processes\\". The transaction was, along with all other pending leases, frozen by Regenvanu when he took office as Minister for Lands, for investigation. The Daily Post stated: > \\"Minister Regenvanu was repeatedly approached by Ministers of State and by > government MPs saying [...] he, Regenvanu, had to sign these leases or the > government would face a confidence vote. [...] Minister Regenvanu has also > confirmed he was rung repeatedly by MP Kalsakau demanding registration of > his leases.

Less than two weeks after taking office, he issued a call, \\"together with a group of chiefs and fellow politicians\\", for the \\"descendants of 'blackbirding' victims living in Australia\\" to receive Vanuatu citizenship.\\"Call for 'blackbirding' victims to be granted Vanuatu citizenship\\", ABC Radio Australia, 23 March 2011 Later, in October, he reiterated the call, while in Queensland to chair a meeting bringing together a Vanuatu delegation and descendants of \\"blackbirded\\" Melanesian workers in the second half of the 19th century, with an aim for the latter to form a nationally representative body for the community. Regenvanu added he would like Australia to grant seasonal work visas to citizens from Vanuatu. On 24 April (Easter Sunday), Sato Kilman's government was ousted by a motion of no confidence in Parliament, by twenty-six votes to twenty-five. Serge Vohor became Prime Minister in his place, and appointed a new Cabinet which included neither Regenvanu nor any other of Kilman's ministers. Yoan Simon, Regenvanu's predecessor, succeeded to the Justice ministry, while Dominique Morin (of the Republican Party) obtained the Ministry of Lands.\\"Vohor takes Vanuatu's top job but instability expected to continue\\", ABC Radio Australia, 25 April 2011 On 13 May, the Court of Appeal voided Vohor's election (and therefore his premiership), deeming it unconstitutional as he had been elected only by a majority of Members of Parliament (26 out of 52), not by an absolute majority. The premiership reverted to Sato Kilman, and the latter's ministers resumed their posts - although Kilman did not appear to have a parliamentary majority. Regenvanu stated that since Vohor and his cabinet were \\"illegal, null and void and were never the government of the country\\", the Kilman government had de jure been legitimate during the brief interlude of Vohor's de facto government.\\"Vanuatu Court decision results in change of government\\", ABC Radio Australia, 13 May 2011 On 16 June, however, Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, in the Supreme Court, ruled that Kilman's premiership was itself null and void, Kilman's election in December not having respected constitutional requirements for a parliamentary secret ballot. Regenvanu lost office on that date. He regained it on 26 June when Kilman was restored as Prime Minister by Parliament, and reinstated his Cabinet. In September, Regenvanu announced that the Customary Land Tribunal would, for the time being, no longer be hearing any new cases, pending reforms. Recommendations from the Malvatumauri (National Council of Chiefs) would be examined with a view to ensuring that \\"power in lands matters goes back to the customary authorities and village courts\\", in accordance with the Constitution, which states that land ownership and usage is to be determined by custom.\\"Land Tribunal on halt\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 20 September 2011 Thus he was able to pursue his policies on land, despite having been reshuffled to the Justice ministry. This was made possible by the enacting, the previous month, of the Customary Land Tribunal (Amendment) Act, a bill introduced to Parliament by Lands Minister Steven Kalsakau, which transferred jurisdiction for the Land Tribunal from the Lands Ministry to the Justice Ministry.\\"Land Tribunal comes under Ministry of Justice\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 18 August 2011 In late November, Regenvanu stated in Parliament that, despite being a government minister, he would vote with members of the opposition against ratification of Vanuatu's accession to the World Trade Organization, because many of his constituents opposed it, and because he himself had always opposed it.\\"Vanuatu cabinet minister says he vote against WTO ratification\\", Radio New Zealand International, 1 December 2011 He did indeed vote against it in Parliament on 1 December, but Vanuatu's accession to the WTO was ratified by 26 votes to 21.\\"Le Vanuatu membre de l‚ÄôOMC\\" , Les Nouvelles cal√©doniennes, 13 December 2011\\"Sambo praises Regenvanu for voting against WTO Bill\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 11 December 2011 As Justice Minister, Regenvanu also set up a commission of inquiry to determine why the recommendations of coroner Nevin Dawson regarding the death of a man in custody in 2010 -a report \\"scathingly critical of Vanuatu police\\"- had never been acted upon. The commission, however, was stopped almost immediately as police commissioner Joshua Bong sought a judicial review of it. In 2010, before becoming a minister, Regenvanu had already accused Bong of trying to \\"derail the coroner's inquest\\" into the prisoner's death in custody.\\"Vanuatu Minister hopes to relaunch inquiry into lack of action on Coroner‚Äôs Report\\", Radio New Zealand International, 12 December 2011 On 16 January 2012, Regenvanu received a letter from Prime Minister Kilman terminating his position as minister. Regenvanu said the letter accused him of being disloyal to the government, without further explanation, although he thought it might be due to his having voted against Vanuatu's entry in the World Trade Organization.\\"PM terminates minister\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 17 January 2012 He described his sacking as \\"appropriate\\", as no minister in the country's history had ever voted against a government bill before, but said that he did not regret voting against WTO accession, as he had voted in accordance with the wishes of people. He added that, being outside the cabinet, he would now \\"be able to be much more critical of government policy and ask questions - something I wasn't able to do as a minister\\".\\"\\"Justified\\" sacking gives Regenvanu more freedom\\", ABC Radio Australia, 19 January 2012 In a press release shortly thereafter, he evoked the other reasons which might have led to his dismissal, presenting himself as a conviction politician who had opposed government decisions he saw as wrong: > I [...] did not support the recent Council of Ministers decision to appoint > Mme Titam Ghoiset as Roving Ambassador to Russia with a 15% commission on > any money she obtains for Vanuatu, so this may be another of my > transgressions. > I have also spoken publicly, in political awareness campaigns, about my > opposition to the use of Government funds to increase the salaries and > benefits of politicians. [...] I have also publicly stated my opposition to > the recent decision [...] to provide new cars at Government expense to four > MPs: the First and Second Deputy Speakers, the Leader of Government Business > and the Government Whip [...], at a time when many teachers and nurses are > still waiting to receive outstanding salaries owed to them.

The signing of > this Agreement has not been endorsed by the Council of Ministers.\\" A few days later, he formally left the government backbenches and became in independent member once more.\\"No discussion with PM: Regenvanu\\", Radio Australia, 25 January 2011 Summing up what he had achieved as Minister for Justice, Regenvanu said he had enabled the salaries of lawyers at the Public Solicitor's Office to match those at the Attorney General's Office, so that \\"the Public Solicitor can now attract and retain quality lawyers to serve needy people\\". He had brought about an amendment of the Law Commission Act \\"to provide a role for chiefs, churches, women and youth in screening all bills before they came before Parliament\\". He had begun a draft bill to \\"return jurisdiction over land disputes to chiefs at the community or 'nakamal' level\\". =Second term as Member of Parliament= In the October 2012 general election, Regenvanu was re-elected MP for Port Vila, with 2,250 votes, \\"in excess of 1000 votes more than any other candidate in the country\\", beating his own previous national record for the highest victory in a parliamentary election.\\"Vanuatu party leader pledges political reform\\", Radio New Zealand International, 31 October 2012\\"Melanesian politics: Stael blong Vanuatu\\", The Interpreter, 20 November 2012 His Land and Justice Party obtained four seats in Parliament.2012 election results, Republic of Vanuatu Official Gazette, 6 November 2012 Jenny Hayward-Jones, for the Lowy Institute for International Policy, commented: \\"The country's young people [‚Ä¶] are likely to have their eye on 43 year old Ralph Regenvanu [...]. He is ambitious and offers a younger constituency a more effective voice in the parliament than that often delivered by the country's leaders. Whether he has what it takes to rise to the top job however, is less certain\\". In March 2013, described by the Daily Post as a \\"popular young leader\\" on the Opposition benches, he strongly criticised what he saw as the Kilman government's lack of \\"fiscal responsibility\\", with a lack of funding for decentralisation or for students' scholarships, while ministers and MPs still had their foreign travels funded. During a speech in Parliament criticising budget priorities, he mentioned Kilman's \\"directive to the Public Service not to buy any new cars, and then they went and bought 25 million vatu worth of new vehicles. So who is the boss of the Public Service? Are you - the Prime Minister - not the boss?\\" Highlighting the country's trade deficit, he added: ‚ÄúWe see less exports and more imports. Since we joined the WTO, less exports and more imports. Local businesses are breaking down. We spend hundreds of millions of vatu in trade, but what do we do with it? We talk about more development needed in the productive sector, but kill it off\\". He nonetheless noted the budget safeguards on spending on education and health, and voted in favour of the budget so as not to block necessary spending on public services.\\"Regenvanu hits out at government spending\\", Vanuatu Daily Post, 14 March 2013 A few days later, the Pacific Institute of Public Policy, describing him as a \\"populist\\", noted his \\"directness, which can be perceived within some quarters as pushing beyond the boundary of the Melanesian culture of respect for authority\\".\\"Going through the motions\\", Pacific Institute of Public Policy, 20 March 2013 In June 2015, he and his fellow Land and Justice Party MPs (Alfred Maoh, Gillion Williams and Daniel Nalet) published the details of their use of their parliamentary allocation funding for community purposes, most notably \\"to establish academic scholarships schemes in their constituencies\\". Informing the public of their use of these funds had been a campaign pledge.\\"Vanuatu's Graon mo Jastis Pati releases MP spending reports\\", Radio New Zealand,29 June 2015 =Appointment to Cabinet during second term= Regenvanu initially sat on the Opposition benches. On 21 March 2013, the government of Prime Minister Sato Kilman fell when it lost the confidence of Parliament, and Regenvanu's ally Moana Carcasses Kalosil became Prime Minister two days later. Carcasses appointed him Minister for Lands, Geology, Mines, Energy and Water resources.\\"Nation's interest first: Carcasses\\" , Vanuatu Daily Post, 26 mars 2013 Regenvanu stated \\"I‚Äôve been preparing for it for a while, to get into this Ministry\\", adding: \\"I think eighty percent of my time will be taken up with cleaning up the mess that‚Äôs been left\\". He announced he would pursue the reforms which he had begun to initiate during his previous (brief) term as Minister for Lands. He would once more seek to overhaul and regulate the leasing and selling of public lands.\\"Vanuatu‚Äôs new Lands Minister keen to reform way country manages land\\", Radio New Zealand International, 25 March 2013 Shortly after his appointment, he announced his intention to reform land law, to enshrine customary ownership of lands, and ensure that lands could not be leased without the consent of their collective traditional owners. This would be achieved by drawing inspiration from the Australian Northern Territory's Northern Land Council, which is designed to safeguard Aboriginal customary land ownership. Describing himself as a ‚Äúnotorious critic‚Äù of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: \\"New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank are saying that we need to get away from [customary ownership], but I totally disagree. We need to enshrine it so that cultural land-owning groups or land-stewarding groups never lose control of the resource\\". He suggested that the government should encourage and support an agriculture- based economy, empowering customary land-owners.\\"Vanuatu minister calls for ‚Äòenshrining‚Äô of custom land tenure to protect Pacific\\", Pacific Scoop, 23 April 2013 As Minister for Lands, he introduced a proposal whereby land leases would necessarily be examined by a committee, thus depriving the ministry itself of the power to lease lands without any external controls. This was a response to alleged acts of corruption carried out by previous ministers. This unprecedented reform was described as part of Regenvanu's ongoing measures against corruption. More generally, his proposals sought to \\"untangle a whole series of obscure rules on customary landownership\\", and provide clarity to landowners.\\"Les r√©formes fonci√®res pr√©occupent le Vanuatu\\", Radio Australia, 18 October 2013 The bill based on his proposals was adopted as the Customary Land Management Act in December 2013. Under this law, land ownership is henceforth determined by customary institutions, rather than the ordinary courts. In addition, the Malvatu Mauri (council of chiefs) must be consulted on legislation relating to land. And \\"the Minister of Land no longer has the power to unilaterally approve any dealings on land\\"; \\"every land dealing has to be approved by the Land Management Planning Committee\\".\\"New Vanuatu laws strengthen role of custom in land deals\\", Radio New Zealand International, 29 January 2014 He crossed the floor with his party on 15 May 2014 to help bring down the Carcasses government.

In September, he urged member states at the Pacific Island Forum to endorse Vanuatu's initiative to have West Papua added to the United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories. While the Forum's ensuing statement merely recognised the need to pursue \\"constructive engagement with Indonesia with respect to elections and human rights in West Papua\\", Regenvanu reached out also for support from the Non-Aligned Movement, the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States (with bilateral meetings with some of those states' representatives), and the European Union, and succeeded in having the subject placed on the agenda of the Caricom Foreign Affairs Ministers meeting and the African Union Summit.\\"Vanuatu will continue West Papua initiative\\", One PNG, 6 September 2018\\"Pacific Forum backs ‚Äòconstructive engagement‚Äô over West Papua\\", Asia Pacific Report, 7 September 2018 In June 2019 he again urged the Pacific Island Forum to take a stronger stance on West Papua, and during a meeting with New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters, argued New Zealand could help by pressing Indonesia to allow the Forum to investigate allegations of human rights abuses in the territory.\\"Vanuatu minister wants stronger West Papua stance\\", Radio New Zealand International, 7 June 2019 In early 2019 he was made Chairman of the Task Force on the Constitutional Review, tasked with organising consultations in view of a referendum in June to regulate and stabilise the organisation of political parties in the country.\\"Vanuatu‚Äôs first referendum on June 4\\", The Vanuatu Independent, 28 January 2019 =Leader of the Opposition= Following the 2020 general election in which the Land and Justice Party obtained more seats (nine) than any other, Regenvanu was the outgoing government's candidate to succeed Charlot Salwai as Prime Minister. He received the votes of 21 MPs, to 31 for Opposition candidate Bob Loughman (of the Vanua'aku Pati).

Background What little information is available about the history of the work can be summarized as follows.Preface to \\"Sonata in E-flat major for Clarinet and Piano\\" (Baerenreiter BA 8151) by Gerhard Allroggen (translated by Gabriele Thalmann). The only wind instrument for which Felix Mendelssohn wrote any solo works is the clarinet. The famous clarinettist Heinrich Baermann and his son Carl for whom Mendelssohn composed the Konzertst√ºcke opp. 113 and 114 (for clarinet, bassett horn and piano), were two of his close friends. These Konzertst√ºcke are virtuoso concertante works, but the Sonata in E-flat major, written by Mendelssohn in 1824, when he was only 15, is genuine chamber music: the clarinet and the piano are both used equally as a melody and an accompaniment instrument, but the demands on the clarinettist are far more modest than in opp. 113 and 114. Albert Rice describes it as a musically weak student work. The various playing characteristics of the clarinet are not fully exploited; instead, Mendelssohn focuses more on the cantabile character of the instrument ‚Äì as he does in his orchestral works. There is no specific information about the history of origin of this sonata. For some time, the copy owned by the Deutsche Staatsbibliothek Berlin ‚Äì Preu√üischer Kulturbesitz was the only known source of the work, on the title page of which the copyist noted in ink: \\"Sonate f√ºr B Clarinette u. Pianoforte / von Mendelssohn Bartholdi.\\" The following remarks were added by another hand, also in ink: \\"NB: Dieser Titel befindet sich nicht darauf [Refers to the version used by the copyist ‚Äì probably the autograph], sondem blo√ü die Zu-Eignung an mich! / 1824.\\" [NB: This title is not written on it, but only the dedication to me is! / 1824]. Furthermore, \\"Kaskel in Dresden\\" was added in pencil. Baron Karl von Kaskel, who was also friends with Giacomo Meyerbeer and Richard Wagner, was a banker and a patron of the arts in Dresden. If the autograph was indeed dedicated to Kaskel, he must have been an amateur clarinettist; judging by the relatively simple clarinet part, the sonata was apparently meant for an amateur and not for a virtuoso. There is no evidence for the presupposition that the work is dedicated to Heinrich Baermann. In any case, the additional comment on the title page of the Berlin copy was definitely not written by Baermann. The dating merely suggests that whomever the autograph was dedicated to, had it copied in 1824 (perhaps at the request of Mendelssohn); the composition was probably written not much earlier. Although the autograph is now available again in the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York (from the Mary Flagler Cary Music Collection), it does not help to solve the problem concerning the Berlin copy. It consists of 10 sheets of 16-stave music paper, 17 pages of which have been written on (the bottom staff of each page was left blank). The pages have been cut to a considerably smaller size: the top of the first page only shows part of Mendelssohn's fervent prayer \\"L. e. g. G.\\" (Lass es gelingen, Gott! ‚Äì Let it be successful, Lord!) and the lower right hand corner of sheet 9r, below the ornament at the end of the composition, only displays the date \\"d. 17 April\\" without the year. A title page (which could have given the dedication) does not exist; merely \\"Sonata\\" is written above the first staff.

Pre-1857 The Meerut Division first appeared in the Indian Army List in 1829, under the command of Sir Jasper Nicolls, KCB.East India Register and Directory 1829. At this period Divisions were primarily administrative organisations controlling the brigades and stations in their area, rather than field formations, but they did provide field forces when required. There were generally one Indian cavalry and two Indian infantry regiments stationed at Meerut itself, in addition to British troops: in 1829 these were the 4th Bengal Light Cavalry, 29th and 32nd Bengal Native Infantry.  Indian Rebellion of 1857  In May 1857, on the eve of the 'Indian Rebellion of 1857' (or 'First War of Independence'), the troops at Meerut comprised the 6th Dragoon Guards (Carabiniers) and a battalion of the 60th (King's Royal Rifle Corps), the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry, and 11th and 20th Bengal Native Infantry under the command of Maj-Gen W.H. Hewitt.East India Register and Army List 1857 Volume II.David. The outbreak of the rebellion at Meerut was one of the first and most serious of the whole conflict.  Post-1857  The division was reconstituted when peace returned. Over succeeding decades, the stations controlled by Meerut Division varied, and the forces under command were regularly rotated.

In the next round of reforms inaugurated by Lord Kitchener as CinC, they became numbered divisions with their territorial affiliation as a subsidiary title. The title 7th (Meerut) Division first appeared in the Army List between 30 September and 31 December 1904, as part of Western (later Northern) Command. On the eve of World War I, the division had its HQ at Mussoorie, and had the Meerut Cavalry Brigade and the Bareilly (HQ Ranikhet), Dehra Dun and Garhwal (HQ Lansdowne) Infantry Brigades under command.Monthly Army List August 1914.  World War I  = Western Front = In 1914 the 7th (Meerut) Division was part of Indian Expeditionary Force A sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting in France. The bulk constituted an infantry division as part of Indian Corps, while the Meerut Cavalry Brigade was detached to form part of 2nd Indian Cavalry Division in the Indian Cavalry Corps. While in France the division was known as the Meerut Division, and its brigades by their names, to avoid confusion with the 7th British Division. Despatch from India was delayed by the activities of the German raiders Emden and Konigsberg operating in the Indian Ocean, and by the slow speed of the transport vessels. The division landed at Marseilles 12‚Äì14 October 1914, but there were further delays while the troops were re-armed with the latest pattern rifle, and the supply train could be improvised, using tradesmen's vans procured locally.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, p. 92, Note 1.

Edmonds & Wynne 1915, Vol II, Appendix 2 = Mesopotamia = On 13 August 1915, General Sir John Nixon, commanding Indian Expeditionary Force D in Mesopotamia, requested one of the Indian infantry divisions in France as reinforcements for his advance on Baghdad. Coincidentally, on the same day, the Secretary of State for India, Austen Chamberlain, told the Viceroy of India that he was anxious for the Indian infantry to be withdrawn from France before they had to endure another winter. The system for supplying drafts had broken down and the Indian battalions were becoming very weak after the heavy casualties they had suffered. Although the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, objected to their withdrawal from the Western Front, orders were issued on 31 October for the two divisions of Indian Corps (3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Division) to embark at Marseilles for Mesopotamia. They were to leave behind their attached Territorial Force battalions.Edmonds & Wynne, 1915, Vol II, pp. 402‚Äì3. The two divisions were relieved in the front line on 6 November and were due at Basra on 1 December, but their departure from Marseilles was delayed until after 25 December because of fear of submarine attack.Moberly, Vol II. 7th (Meerut) Division finally arrived in Mesopotamia in Spring 1917 and joined Tigris Corps, too late to relieve the 6th (Poona) Division at Kut-al-Amara. The division participated in the battles at the Sheikh Sa'ad, Wadi, Hanna, Dujailia, and the Sannaiyat. After the fall of Kut, as part of the reorganization of the British and Indian forces in the region, the division spent much of the summer and fall refitting. The Meerut and Lahore Divisions would eventually become part of the I Indian Army Corps, part of the newly formed Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force, participating in the capture of Baghdad in March 1917. = Palestine = The Meerut Division at Nahr al-Kalb (Dog river) in Lebanon, October 1918 After the fall of Baghdad, the Palestine Campaign was given priority over Mesopotamia, and in December 1917 Sir Edmund Allenby, commanding the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), was informed that after he had captured Jerusalem he would be reinforced by the 7th (Meerut) Division from Mesopotamia. The division moved from Mesopotamia to Egypt in December,Moberly and then on 1 April 1918 it relieved the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which was on its way to the Western Front.Falls, Part I. The EEF undertook few operations during the hot weather of Summer 1918, but the Meerut Division captured 'North Sister' and 'South Sister' Hills on 8 June, and raided 'Piffer Ridge' on 27 June. It subsequently took part in Allenby's advance through Palestine, including the Battle of Megiddo as part of Lieutenant-General Bulfin's XXI British Corps operating on the right flank.Falls, Part II. = Order of Battle September 1918 = In September 1918, the division had the following composition:Bullock, Appendix.

It is often textured, colored, or painted after application. It is generally used on exterior walls but can be used to feature an interior wall. Depending on the 'look' required, rendering can be fine or coarse, textured or smooth, natural or colored, pigmented or painted. The cement rendering of brick, concrete and mud houses has been used for centuries to improve the appearance (and sometimes weather resistance) of exterior walls. It can be seen in different forms all over southern Europe. Different countries have their own styles and traditional colors.  Render finishes Different finishes can be created by using different tools such as trowels, sponges, or brushes. The art in traditional rendering is (apart from getting the mix right) the appearance of the top coat. Different tradesmen have different finishing styles and are able to produce different textures and decorative effects. Some of these special finishing effects may need to be created with a thin finishing 'top coat' or a finishing wash. Traditional rendering Cement render consists of 6 parts clean sharp fine sand, 1 part cement, and 1 part lime. The lime makes the render more workable and reduces cracking when the render dries. Any general purpose cement can be used. Various additives can be added to the mix to increase adhesion. Coarser sand is used in the base layer and slightly finer sand in the top layer. The application process resembles the process for applying paint. To ensure adhesion, the surface to be rendered is initially hosed off to ensure it is free of any dirt and loose particles. Old paint or old render is scraped away. The surface is roughened to improve adhesion. For large areas, vertical battens are fixed to the wall every 1 to 1.5 meters, to keep the render flat and even. Acrylic rendering There is also a wide variety of premixed renders for different situations. Some have a polymer additive to the traditional cement, lime and sand mix for enhanced water resistance, flexibility and adhesion. Acrylic premixed renders have superior water resistance and strength. They can be used on a wider variety of surfaces than cement render, including concrete, cement blocks, and AAC concrete paneling. These acrylic modified renders are still too brittle and cannot be applied over substrates like fibre cement sheeting, as they will crack on the joints and can allow water to enter the sheet and cause delamination of the coatings (refer James Hardies website & Customer Link). The new high tech polymer exterior cladding such as Uni-Base, and expanded polystyrene (EPS) can have these acrylic modified renders applied to them with the inclusion of an alkali resistant mesh encapsulated between the render coats (refer Coatings manufacturers like Taubmans Armawall Data Sheets for full systems). Some premixed acrylic renders have a smoother complexion than traditional renders. There are also many various acrylic-bound pigmented 'designer' finishing coats that can be applied over acrylic render. Various finishes, patterns and textures are possible such as sand, sandstone, marble, stone, stone chip, lime wash or clay like finishes. There are stipple, glistening finishes, and those with enhanced water resistance and anti fungal properties. Depending upon the product, they can be rolled, troweled or sponged on. A limited number can also be sprayed on. Acrylic renders take only 2 days to dry and cure--much faster than the 28 days for traditional render. A significant disadvantage of acrylic render vs. traditional rendering is that acrylic render lacks the sustainability and environmental compatibility of traditional cement-and- mineral render. All buildings have a finite lifetime, and their materials will eventually be either recycled or absorbed into the environment. Acrylic being a synthetic polymer material, it does not break down by natural weathering the way that a cement, sand, and lime mixture will, persisting in the natural environment for centuries as synthetic chemical compounds that have unknown long-term effects on ecosystems. Also, the application and drying process of acrylic resin render involves the atmospheric evaporation of pollutant solvents--necessary for the application of the resin--which are hazardous to the health of humans and of many organisms on which humans depend. Synthetic polymers such as acrylic are manufactured from chemical feedstocks such as acetone, hydrogen cyanide, ethylene, isobutylene, and other petroleum derivatives. The polymer products cannot be fully recycled (using present technology or any that can be confidently expected to be developed), so new raw materials, taken from the finite and diminishing supply of raw natural resources, must always be put into their manufacture, making the process unsustainable. Traditional cement-based render does not have these problems, making it an arguably better choice in many cases, despite its working limitations.

Altona Coastal Park, a 70 hectares intertidal and salt marsh area located 11 km from Melbourne CBD in the western suburb of Altona, is an important recreational and nature conservation area, providing habitats for a large biodiversity of flora and fauna. It is part of the Cheetham and Altona Important Bird Area. History \\"Requiem for a Champion\\" It was the site of the Williamstown Racecourse from 1864 to 1940, which was closed in 1940 to make way for an army camp during World War II. The site was extensively modified by land filling and site development; and known as the Altona Sports Park before its current name was adopted. Aerial vista of the Melbourne CBD from Altona Coastal Park The remnants of the Williamstown Racecourse Grandstand and a palm tree at the entry to the Grandstand still remains. A 4-metre sculpture called Requiem for a Champion, created by the artist Yvonne George, featuring a bronze stint perched on top of a galloping horse, was installed to commemorate the location of the former Williamstown racecourse. Flora The Park has predominantly saltmarsh vegetation including shrubby glasswort and beaded glasswort, which provide food for the rare orange-bellied parrot. It has at least 8 regionally rare plant species, including the White Mangroves (Avicennia marina) along the southern banks of Kororoit Creek . Large areas of Carpobrotus rossii can be found at the park. It blooms in late October, resulting in swathes of pink flowers. Ongoing rehabilitation programs, which include revegetation of indigenous flora and weed removal, serve to enhance the area's ability to sustain a wider diversity of fauna. Fauna At least 149 bird species are recorded here, of which 13 are rare or endangered. The aquatic birds include black swans, black ducks, pelicans, stilt, giant petrels, ibis, cranes, gulls, red-legged oyster catchers, grey teal, spoonbills, dotterels while the terrestrial birds include blue wrens, larks, rosellas, magpie larks, little tits, crimson robins, nankeen kestrels, wagtails and ravens. Gould's Wattled Bat and the White Striped Freetail bat (both microbats) may also be found hunting insects at night. In addition, one may find tiger snakes in the grasslands and rocky outcrops while native fish, crabs, oysters, cockles, periwinkles and larger warreners proliferate in the sea and creeks. Geology The landform changes from grassy plains in the inner areas to salt marsh, shallow intertidal flats and rocky basalt platforms off the coast of Port Phillip Bay. Kororoit Creek flows through the Park into Port Phillip Bay. Regionally significant geomorphological areas can be found at the wetland terrain at the mouth of the Kororoit Creek as well as at the extensive sand bars off Kororoit Creek. The Park provides a protective buffer zone for the Wader Beach area of the Jawbone Flora and Fauna Reserve, which is located between Williamstown and Altona. Recreational and community use The park is popular with walkers, cyclists and dog-walkers, with the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail passing through the park. The large, open spaces provide unrestricted views of Port Phillip Bay and Melbourne City across the salt marsh. At low tides when the seawater recedes, much of the coastal seabeds are exposed, allowing one to walk a considerable distance into the sea. The park is also used for research and study purposes.

The original Rose first appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man #253 (June 1984), and was created by writer Tom DeFalco. Publication history Tom DeFalco recounted: DeFalco was fired from The Amazing Spider-Man by editor Jim Owsley before he could reveal the Rose's identity. A subsequent issue of Web of Spider-Man, written by Owsley, revealed the Rose to be Richard Fisk. Fictional character biography The character of Rose is depicted as a well-dressed, calm, calculating and gentleman-like crime lord who favors roses and wears a leather, lilac-colored mask. =Richard Fisk= The first Rose was Richard Fisk, the son of Wilson Fisk, who sought to overthrow his father after learning he was the Kingpin of Crime. He later became a Punisher-like vigilante, calling himself Blood Rose. He was eventually shot dead by his own mother, Vanessa.http://marvel.com/universe/Fisk,_Richard =Sergeant Blume= The second Rose was Sergeant Blume (first name unrevealed), a police officer seeking revenge on the Kingpin for the death of his brother, another policeman. While Blume allied himself with Richard in hopes of doing good by breaking the Kingpin's hold on the city, he ended up implicated in several crimes while in the Kingpin's service. He ultimately was shot and killed in a confrontation with Richard's men in the Catskills after he had kidnapped Peter Parker (Spider-Man)'s Aunt May and wife Mary Jane Watson, mistakenly thinking that Peter had discovered information that would blow the lid off of the Kingpin's organization, thus revealing Blume as a double agent.http://marvel.com/universe/Rose_(Blume) =Jacob Conover= The third Rose was Jacob Conover, a reporter at the Daily Bugle, who took up the identity as payment for saving the life of crime lord Don Fortunato many years earlier. This Rose was loyal solely to Fortunato, as at the time the Kingpin had not returned to power, and his principal enforcer was the cyborg powerhouse known as Delilah. Conover faced a repeated threat to his territory from the Argentinian crime lord known as the Black Tarantula, eventually being present without his Rose disguise when the Tarantula launched a direct assault on Fortunato's home. Preparing to gun down the Tarantula and a roomful of witnesses, Conover was stopped by Spider-Man and carted off to jail. =Phillip Hayes= The fourth Rose was Dr. Phillip Hayes. He took up the Rose persona after he lost his funding in gene-therapy research after an accident in the Phelcorps laboratory, a result of which was the new heroine Jackpot. He deals in \\"Ebony\\" shipments, a synthesized drug created from Corruptor's sweat glands. He managed to slip under the superhero radar for a while, but Jackpot was getting closer to discovering his involvement. After he discovered the secret identity of his opponent (through a coincidence resulting from being Sara Ehret's co-worker), he hires Boomerang to track Sara down at her house and murders her husband in front of her and her daughter. He is later arrested and unmasked, much to Sara's shock. Powers and abilities The Roses have no superhuman powers. Richard Fisk is trained in the use of guns and has some martial-arts training; Sergeant Blume is a trained police officer; and Jacob Conover is trained in the use of firearms and has a number of criminal contacts. The Roses always carries a handgun and often carries a variety of mini grenades.

Penck had been the head of the geographic department, including the Museum of Marine Sciences (German: Museum f√ºr Meereskunde), since 1905. The Austrian hydrographer Alfred Merz became his successor in 1910. The Institute and Museum of Marine Sciences became an independent unit of the university in 1920, with Merz as director. In 1912 Merz made it possible for W√ºst to join Bj√∏rn Helland-Hansen in Bergen/Norway, thus getting to know the Norwegian colleagues‚Äô methods. W√ºst then gained practical experience in ocean observations by working on lightships, on surveying vessels and during cruises on the Norwegian research vessel ‚ÄúArmauer Hansen‚Äù in the Nordic Seas led by Helland-Hansen.

During the war he served as a meteorologist and was wounded near Verdun in 1917. After the war he became an assistant of Merz and participated in several research cruises in the North and Baltic Seas. Merz was planning a systematic hydrographic survey of the Atlantic Ocean. His proposal was met with approval by the key scientific institution in Germany after World War I, the Emergency Association of German Science (see Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft). The German survey ship Meteor was made available for observations in the South Atlantic and the North Atlantic up to 30¬∞N. W√ºst participated in much of the planning and then joined the cruise from 1925 to 1927. When the chief scientist Merz died in Buenos Aires in June 1925, W√ºst took over the leadership for the oceanographic observations.Fritz Spiess: Die Meteorfahrt.

He obtained the permission to teach (Habilitation) at the Friedrich-Wilhelm-University in Berlin in 1929 with a thesis on the Florida Current and was appointed Professor in 1936. In the meantime he had become a well-esteemed member of the international marine science community. However, all these connections broke down with the approach of World War II. W√ºst had become a member of the NSDAP and served as a member of the nautical-scientific staff at the Supreme Command of the Navy during the war. At the same time, however, he continued teaching at the Friedrich- Wilhelm-University in Berlin.

The main focus of the institute in Kiel had been marine biology in the shallow seas of the Baltic and the North Sea before, with some history of hydrography, marine chemistry and marine geology. W√ºst brought his experience in deep-sea research to bear in the scientific orientation of the Kiel institute. He and ultimately his successor from 1959, G√ºnter Dietrich, an earlier collaborator in the Berlin institute, changed the earlier focus towards deep ocean work, in particular in physical oceanography and marine chemistry. With this scientific orientation and the related teaching the Kiel institute took over the legacy of the Berlin institute. In particular the teaching required a close association with Kiel University. From 1950 to 1952 W√ºst served as Dean of the Faculty of Philosophy which also enclosed Mathematics and Science at that time. After his retirement at Kiel University in 1959, W√ºst followed an invitation to be a visiting professor at the Lamont‚ÄìDoherty Earth Observatory in Columbia-University, New York, USA. Here, his main focus was the circulation in the Caribbean Sea.Arnold L. Gordon: Editor‚Äôs Preface. In: Arnold L. Gordon (Hrsg.): Studies in Physical Oceanography (= 1.).

During this stay in the USA, W√ºst also accepted an invitation in 1962 to the Walker-Ames-Chair of the University of Washington in Seattle. After his return to Germany in 1965 he was a visiting professor at the Institute of Meteorology of the University of Bonn (German: Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universit√§t Bonn) in Germany until 1967. Georg W√ºst was married to Martha W√ºst from 1921 to 1941. They had two children. From 1943 he was remarried to Maria W√ºst. Scientific achievements W√ºst stood out by the ability of gaining a profound understanding of ocean processes from a systematic description and analysis of oceanic data sets, in particular the property exchange, the origin of water masses and their large-scale motions and transports. His main research themes were: evaporation and precipitation and the water budget of the ocean, the large-scale distribution and circulation of deep water masses in the Atlantic and other oceans, the motions of Gulf Stream and Kuroshio, the origin of polar bottom waters and the circulation in the Mediterranean Sea. In his later years there followed treatises on the history of deep-sea research. Dietrich (1972) G√ºnter Dietrich: Georg W√ºst‚Äôs Scientific Work. Dedication to His Eightieth Birthday. In: Arnold L.

Gordon and Breach Science Publishers, New York 1972, S. xi-xx. presented a complete list of W√ºst‚Äôs 112 publications in his contribution to the book which was published as a tribute to W√ºst‚Äôs 80th birthday. For his doctoral thesis W√ºst performed systematic observations of evaporation on several vessels, developed specific analysis methods and discussed distribution patterns of evaporation in the world oceans. He returned to the related topics of evaporation, precipitation and salinity at the ocean-atmosphere interface and their relevance for the water budget at numerous times through the following decades.Georg W√ºst: Verdunstung und Niederschlag auf der Erde.

The author and the date that the motto was adopted by the Royal are unknown. The first mention of the motto was during the tenure of Principal Todd (1871‚Äì1878) who constantly reminded dullards that they must learn or depart. Since then the motto is associated with the school's high educational standard. It is also the motto of Gosfield Independent School in Essex, England, and the variation \\"Aut Disce, Aut Discƒìde\\" (\\"Either Learn or Leave\\") is the motto of Hutton Grammar School in Preston, Lancashire.

Ivor Hugh Norman Evans (1886‚Äì1957) was a British anthropologist, ethnographer and archaeologist who spent most of his working life in peninsular British Malaya (now Malaysia) and in North Borneo (now Sabah, Malaysia). Life Evans was educated at Charterhouse School and at Clare College, University of Cambridge, during which time he studied under Alfred Haddon. In 1910‚Äì11 he briefly served as a colonial administrator, as cadet district officer for the North Borneo Chartered Company, which administrated the independent state and British protectorate of North Borneo. He was based in the Tempasuk and Tuaran Districts. Evans spent much of his career on peninsular Malaya from 1912 until 1932 at the Perak State Museum in Taiping, the first museum in Malaysia. He was appointed Curator there in 1917 and also worked as an ethnographer and archaeologist. Evans took early retirement in 1932 and returned to England, settling at Oulton Broad in Suffolk. He remained there until 1938. However, he missed the East and decided to return to Borneo, where he was to spend the rest of his life. He carried out ethnographic research on the religious beliefs, practices and folklore of the Dusuns of the Kota Belud area. During the Japanese occupation of Borneo in World War II, Evans was held as a civilian internee at Batu Lintang camp at Kuching in Sarawak. He died in Labuan on 3 May 1957.

Biography Ober was born February 13, 1849 in Beverly, Massachusetts. He received a common school education. While yet a boy, he evinced a fondness for natural history: he collected nearly all the birds of New England and noted their habits. From 1862 to 1866 he had an occupation as shoemaker. Subsequently, he attended the Massachusetts Agricultural College but due to the lack of funds he was forced to leave the college after a short time. From 1867 to 1870 he worked as employee in a drugstore and again as shoemaker. In 1872, he abandoned his business pursuits to hunt in Florida. In 1874 he made a second trip, successfully explored Lake Okeechobee, and published in periodicals a description of the lake and its shores. From 1876 to 1878 he made ornithological surveys to the Lesser Antilles where he discovered 22 bird taxa new to science. Two of them - the Lesser Antillean flycatcher and the Montserrat oriole - were named in his honor by his colleague George Newbold Lawrence. In 1881, moved by a desire to see the vestiges of early American civilization, he journeyed through Mexico, and during that and two subsequent trips gathered the material for several books. On his return from various explorations he prepared accounts of his travels at the request of scientific societies, and later a series of popular lectures, illustrated with photographic views, projected by the magic lantern. His lectures, originally delivered before the Lowell Institute in Boston, included \\"Mexico, Historical and Picturesque,\\" \\"Ancient Cities of Mexico,\\" \\"The Mexican Indian,\\" \\"Adventures in the West Indies,\\" and \\"Through Florida with Gun and Camera.\\" Ober was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1893.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Ober died May 31, 1913, in his home in Hackensack, New Jersey.

While a relatively rare disease, it is the most common type of primary gastrointestinal T-cell lymphoma. Prior to 2008, EATL was defined as a single type of small intestina lymphoma but in that year the World Health Organization divided the disease into two subtypes: 1) EATL type I which occurs in individuals with coeliac disease, a chronic immune disorder wherein individuals mount inflammatory responses to dietary gluten primarily in the upper reaches (i.e. jejunum and duodenum) of the small intestine and 2) EATL type II, a disorder similar to EATL type I that occurs in individuals who do not have coeliac disease. While type I and II EATL share many similar features, post-2008 studies found some significant differences between the two types of EATL. In consequence, the World Health Organization of 2016 redefined the two diseases as separate entities, keeping the term enteropathy-associted T cell lymphoma for the coeliac disease-associated lymphoma and terming the lymphoma not associated with coeliac disease monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma (MEITL). EATL is 5- to 10-times more common than MEITL. The Organization (2016) also defined a third type of intestinal T cell lymphoma that could not be classified as EATL or MEITL as peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (ITCL-NOS). EATL arises from the malignant transformation of small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL). IEL are a heterogeneous group of principally T cell lymphocytes, that reside in epithelial tissues which interface the environment such as the mucosa of the bronchi, reproductive tract, and gastrointestinal tract (GI tract). At these sites, IEL are exposed and regulate immune responses to non-dietary and dietary antigens, pathogenic and non-pathogenic organisms, and injured self tissues. Gastrointestinal tract IEL are in the epithelium of the small intestine, colon, stomach, and esophagus, residing between the epithelial cells which line these organs' lumens. These IEL often exhibit natural killer and cytotoxic T cell cell activation markers, contain various toxic agents (e.g. perforin, granzyme), and therefore are capable, if activated, of causing severe tissue injuries. In celiac disease, the IEL react to the glutelins in dietary gluten by: increasing their numbers; becoming pathologically active; producing chronic inflammation that injures intestinal cells; interfering with nutrient absorption; and creating an environment conducive to their malignant transformation into EATL. Optimal treatment of EATL has used regimens consisting of intensive chemotherapy, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and, in cases where there is bulky, obstructive, and/or perforated bowel disease, surgical intervention. The lymphoma has had a 5-year overall survival rate of only ~20%. However, recent studies focusing on the malignant IEL in EATL have increased our understanding of the disease and suggested newer chemotherapy-based strategies and novel molecular targets that might be attacked therapeutically to improve the disease's prognosis. Presentation EATL typically occurs in individuals aged 60‚Äì70 who, like coeliac disease patients, are descendants of Northern Europeans. Patients with a history of coeliac disease who develop EATL may have been previously diagnosed with Type I or II RFD but in any case present with worsening of their disease symptoms of abdominal pain, malabsorption, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, and/or night sweats. The diagnosis of EATL is more likely if the latter symptoms develop suddenly. or if the serious symptoms of bowel obstruction and/or bowel perforation caused by bulky EATL masses develop. Individuals with ulcerative jejunitis usually present with more severe symptoms, including more frequent bowel perforations and obstructions. Some patients with no history of coeliac disease present with symptoms and/or signs of a small intestinal lymphoma but on diagnostic workup are found to have coeliac disease.  Pathophysiology  = Genetics = The cause of EATL, while not fully understood, is by definition related to celiac disease. Individuals are genetically predisposed to develop celiac disease because of the specific types of HLA-DQ proteins expressed by their antigen-presenting cells (APC). HLA-DQ proteins are on the surface of APC and function to present foreign or self antigens to the T cell receptors (TCR) expressed on the surface of T-cells and thereby to stimulate these cells either to initiate or suppress immune responses to the presented antigens. HLA-DQ proteins are composed of Œ± and Œ≤ polypeptide chains encoded by the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes, respectively. Since there are several different alleles (i.e. gene variants) at these two genetic loci, individuals are usually heterozygous, i.e. have inherited different alleles from each parent at each locus; uncommonly, however, individuals are homozygous at one or both loci because their parents have the same alleles at one or both loci. The HLA-DQ proteins that predispose individuals to coeliac disease bind and respond specifically to gluten-related antigens presented to them by APC. The genetic predisposition to develop coeliac disease is clinically determined by identifying the serotypes of an individual's APC's HLA-DQ proteins using serotype-specific antibody preparations and/or by identifying the alleles at an individual's HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genetic loci. Studies show that: * Celiac disease affects ~1% of the population in most parts of the world. * Ninety to one hundred percent of patients with coeliac disease have inherited genes at the HLA-DQ locus that encode HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 serotype proteins. * About 2-3% of individuals who inherit these HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 serotypes develop coeliac disease. * About 90% of coeliac disease patients are homozygous for (i.e. inherited from both parents) either the HLADQA1*0501https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi- bin/ipd/imgt/hla/get_allele.cgi?DQB1*0501 or HLADQA1*0505 alleles at the HLA- DQA1 locus plus either the HLADQB1*0201https://www.ebi.ac.uk/cgi- bin/ipd/imgt/hla/get_allele.cgi?DQB1*0201 or HLA-DQB1*0202 alleles at the HLA- DQB1 locus; <5% of coeliac disease patients are heterozygous (i.e. inherited from just one parent) for these alleles; and 5-10% of coeliac disease patients have inherited HLA-DQA1*03 plus HLA-DQB1*0302 alleles at the respective HLA- DQA1 and DAQB1 loci. * Less than 1% of all individuals with coeliac disease develop EATL. * Individuals homozygous for the HLADQB1*0201 allele at the HLA- DQB1 locus develop a particularly severe and tissue-damaging form of coeliac disease and have a greatly increased rate of developing EATL. * The vast majority of patients with coeliac disease who develop EATL have either the HLADQA1*0501 or HLADQB1*0201 allele (see previous paragraphs) at the HLA-DQB1 locus. = Intraepithelial lymphocytes = IEL are a diverse population of lymphocytes, which unlike most peripheral lymphocytes, do not recirculate through the blood and/or lymphatic system but rather reside permanently in the epithelium of various organs. In the GI tract, IEL localize between the epithelial cells lining the colon, small intestine, stomach, and esophagus where they serve to maintain the mucosal barrier, combat infection by pathogens, and regulate immune responses to antigens originating from the diet, pathogens, and damaged tissues. Human IEL are classified into those which express the TCR (i.e. TCL+IEL) and those which do not (i.e. TCR-IEL). TCL+IEL are further divided into 4 subtypes, TCRŒ±Œ≤+CD4+ IEL, TCRŒ±Œ≤+CD4+CD8Œ±Œ±+ IEL, TCRŒ±Œ≤+CD8Œ±Œ≤+ IEL, and TCRŒªŒ¥+CD8Œ±Œ±+. These subtypes are based on the expression of alpha (Œ±) and beta (Œ≤) chain-containing TCR (i.e. Œ±Œ≤TCR); gamma (Œ≥) and delta (Œ¥) chain-containing TCR (i.e. Œ≥Œ¥TCR); CD4; CD8Œ±Œ≤; and/or CD8Œ±Œ± by individual IEL.. A fifth TCL+IEL subtype, TCRŒ±Œ≤+CD8Œ±Œ±+, occurs in mice but its presence in the human intestine is disputed. Human TCR-IEL are also divided into 4 sub-types: their: ILC1-like IEL have morphological and functional similarities to normal intestinal epithelial cells and express NKp46; ICL3-like IEL have morphological similarities to normal epithelial cells and, similar to Th1 cells, make Interleukin 17 (IL-17) and Interleukin 22 (IL-22) cytokines and express the RORŒ≥t transcription factor and NKp44; iCD3-IEL express iCD3; and iCD8Œ±-IEL express iCD3 and CD8Œ±. CD3 designates a protein complex that is attached to the cell surface membrane whereas iCD3 refers to a CD3 protein complex in which one or more of its proteins resides abnormally in the cell's cytosol Studies suggest that iCD3+IEL are the principal cell type that becomes malignant in EATL cases that are not classified as de novo (see next section). These cells also express CD103 and, frequently, CD30. = Acquisition of malignancy = Coeliac disease patients may be asymptomatic, minimally symptomatic, and/or well-controlled on a gluten-free diet (i.e. a diet free of cereal, rye, wheat, and barley) but nonetheless develop EATL. About 46% of all AETL cases occur in this setting and have had their malignancy described as de novo EATL. The remaining ~54% of EATL cases develop in coeliac disease patients whose disease becomes refractory to dietary control, exhibits increasing symptoms, and progress over ~4‚Äì10 years through Type I refractor coeliac disease (Type 1 RCD) and Type II refractory coeliac disease (Type II RCD) to become EATL. The rates at which non-refractory celiac disease, Type I RCD, and Type II RCD progress to de novo or EATL are <1%, 3-14%, and 33-52%, respectively.  De novo EATL  De novo EATL can occur in individuals whose coeliac disease was undiagnosed until EATL was found or who have mild/well-controlled coeliac disease. The findings in these patients usually differ little from those found in mild/well- controlled cases that do not progress to EATL; their small intestinal mucosa is populated by increased number of IEL and exhibits tissue destruction (e.g. small intestinal villus atrophy), Nonetheless, their IEL are normal-appearing, small cells that on examination are polyclonal (i.e. genetically diverse), express CD3 and CD8, and do not have genetic abnormalities. The mechanism behind the development of EATL in these individuals is not understood.  Type I refractory coeliac disease  Type I RCD patients, who constitute 15-23% of all patients with RCD, are refractory to the gluten diet as evidenced by their worsening symptoms, increased tissue destruction, and rising numbers of TCRŒ±Œ≤+CD*Œ±Œ≤+IEL in tissue lesions. Some Type I RCD patients may have failed to respond to the diet from the onset of their disease. If either cases, these patients show no change in the normal appearance and polyclonal nature of their small intestinal IEL and these IEL show no genetic abnormalities. The cause for these coeliac disease patients progressing to Type I RCD, after excluding the very common problem of failure to fully exclude gluten from their diets, is either due to their genetic makeup (see above section on genetics) or is unknown.  Type II refractory coeliac disease  Type I RCD patients may progress to Type II RCD as evidenced by their more severe symptoms, increased intestinal tissue destruction, and expanding numbers of intestinal IEL, particularly iCD3+IEL. Their IEL typically consist of genetically different subpopulations of cells that have a monoclonal rearrangement of their TCR and therefore are descendent from a single ancestral cell. Subpopulations of these IEL also have one or more of the following genetic abnormalities: trisomy of chromosome 1's long (or \\"q\\") arm at position 22-44 (abbreviated 1-q22-24); genomic alterations around the TP53 tumor suppressor gene at position 13.1 on the short or \\"p\\" arm of chromosome 17; genomic alterations around the CDKN2A tumor suppressor and CDKN2B cell proliferation regulator at position p21.3 on chromosome 9 that result in loss of heterozygosity for both genes; and/or activating mutations in JAK1 (75% of cases) and STAT3 (25% of cases). In Type II RCD, the same types of abnormal ILE found in the small intestine may be detected in the colon, stomach, mesenteric lymph nodes, blood, bone marrow, and epithelium of the airways and skin. Finally, the small intestinal lesions in Type II RCD contain IL-2 and IL-21 as well as increased levels of IL-15. Laboratory studies indicate that these 3 cytokines acting individually or in synergy are potent stimulators of the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway in iCD3+IEL and thereby promote these cells survival (by blocking apoptosis) and proliferation. The small intestinal lesions also contain a tumor necrosis factor which stimulates iCD3+IEL survival and proliferation but does so by activating NF-Œ∫B, MAPK, and/or c-Jun N-terminal kinases rather than JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. These data suggest that: a) Type II RCD is a low grade lymphoma; 2) the intense inflammation in Type II RCD, perhaps amplified by the cited cytokines, promotes the proliferation, survival, genome instability, and consequential genetic abnormalities in IEL; and 3) one or more of these factors cause the transformation of Type II RD to EATL. As currently understood, the release of IL-15 by mucosal epithelial cells, the binding of IL-15 to the IL-15RŒ≤ cell surface receptor on iCD3+IEL, and the stimulation thereby of these cells appears particularly important in driving Type II RCD to EATL in a significant number of cases. = Ulcerative jejunitis = Ulcerative jejunitis (also termed chronic ulcerative jejunitis, multifocal ulcerated microlymphomas, ulcerative jejunoilitis, and chronic ulcerative jejunoilitis) is regarded as a rare complications or severe form of Type II RCD in which the jejunum or jejunum plus ileum portions of the small intestine contain multifocal ulcers. Patients with this disorder have a higher risk of developing EATL than other Type II RCD patients.  EATL  Besides the genetic gene abnormalities found in Type II RCD, the malignant IEL in EATL consist of one or more subpopulations that have mutations: in other JAK-STAT pathway genes viz., STAT5B, JAK3, and SOCS1 (SOCS1 inhibits STAT signaling); tumor suppressor genes BCL11B and SETD2 (SETD2 is also involved in regulating lymphocyte development); another gene involved in lymphocyte development, PRDM1; a gene promoting activation of the tumor suppressor p53, IRF1; DNA repair genes BRIP1 and TERT (TERT is also involved in maintaining DNA telomeres and thereby chromosome stability); the NRAS and KRAS oncogenes; a gene involved in progression of the cell cycle and thereby cellular proliferation, STK10; a gene involved in promoting cell death by apoptosis, DAPK3; a gene involved in regulating Interferon gamma actions, inhibiting toll-like receptor signaling, and regulating activation of innate and adaptive immune systems, IRF4; a gene involved in cell signaling through various cell receptors, GNAS; a gene involved in production of the immunoglobulin, IgA, BBX; and two chromatin remodeling genes, TET2 and YLPM1. These cells also overexpress or under express various genes that impact cell survival, growth, and malignancy. It is likely that one or more of these genetic and gene expression abnormalities contribute to the malignant behavior of EATL.  Diagnosis  The diagnosis of AETL is based on endoscopic findings of: 1) flattened duodenal folds and small intestinal fissures and ulcers; 2) biopsy findings of small intestinal inflammation, increased IEL, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia; 3) HLA-DG serology typing and/or gene allele analyses showing results compatible with coeliac disease (see above section on genetics); and 4) positive serology tests for IgA antitissue translutamase antibodies, IgA antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides, IgG antibodies to deamidated gliadin peptides, and/or IgA antibodies to antitissue translutamase. About 35% of EATL cases will be found to have spread of the disease to extra-intestinal sites with lesions in the mesenteric lymph nodes (~35% of cases), bone marrow (<10% of cases), and, uncommonly, blood that contain IEL with the same genetic abnormalities and cell markers as those found in the IEL of their intestinal lesions. Intestinal biopsy specimens of EATL lesions also commonly show the presence of mucosal inflammatory cells (particularly eosinophils and histiocytes); a greatly expanded population of medium- to large-sized or anaplastic IEL expressing iCD3 as well as cytotoxic and cell activation markers (e.g. granzyme B and usually TIA1 and perforin); and, frequently CD30. In most cases these IEL also show genetic abnormalities, particularly activating mutations in JAK1 and/or STAT3 and to lesser extents those cited in the above section on EATL. The malignant IEL in EATL do not express CD56. Rarely, patients present with EATL who have no gastrointestinal symptoms of celiac disease but rather with extra-intestinal manifestations that are associated with the disease such as dermatitis herpetiformis, psoriasis, other chronic skin conditions, dental enamel defects, gluten-induced cerebellar ataxia, arthritis, and arthralgias. = Differential diagnosis = Other gastrointestinal T-cell lymphomas can resemble, and therefore need to be differentiated from, EATL. These include: * Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma is distinguished from EATL in that it is not associated with coeliac disease; is more common in Asians than Northern Europeans; and their small intestine lesions show little or no inflammatory cells plus numerous small- to medium-sized, normal appearing IEL that express CD56 but may not express CD30. The genetic abnormalities found in Monomorphic epitheliotropic intestinal T cell lymphoma are similar to those in EATL. * Small intestinal adenocarcinoma, while rare, is far more frequent in coeliac disease than in the general population. Unlike EATL, it often occurs in celiac disease patients who, while otherwise well-maintained on a gluten-free diet, have vague gastrointestinal symptoms such as fatigue, malaise, and weight loss. However, it can cause severe symptoms such as bowel obstruction and intestinal bleeding. Also unlike EATL, the adenocarcinoma often occurs in women and younger (<50 years old) individuals; is more likely to begin as a non-maligant adenoma; and has the histology typical of an adenocarcinoma. * Peripheral T-cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) and anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) are heterogeneous sets of aggressive T cell lymphomas that exhibit variable morphologies. Unlike EATL, they are not associated with coeliac disease and rarely present as an intestinal lymphoma without involvement of extra-intestinal tissues. PTCL-NOS's genetic abnormalities differ from those in EATL: its malignant cells have recurrent mutations in TET2, IDH2, DNMT3A, RHOA, VAV1, and/or CD28 genes, rearrangements of the ITK gene with the SYK, FER, and ERBB4 genes, and/or rearrangements of the TP63 gene. ALCL likewise exhibits different mutations than those occurring in EATL; its malignant cells, similar to those in PTCL-NOS, have recurrent mutations in VAV1, rearrangements of the ITK gene with the SYK, FER, and ERBB genes, and/or rearrangements of the TP63 gene. However, ALCL also has distinctive genetic abnormalities: malignant cells in the ALK+ form of ALCL have a translocation between the NPM1 and ALK genes to form a gene encoding the chimeric protein, NPM-ALK while the malignant cells in the ALK- form of ALCL have translocations of either the DUSP22 or TP63 genes. * Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative diseases are a large group of benign, pre-malignant and malignant lymphoproliferative diseases that are associated with the infection of lymphocytes by the Epstein-Barr virus. One of these diseases, Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type may develop primarily in the small intestine but unlike EATL often involves lesions in the nasal cavity, pharynx, lung, skin, or other tissues. Furthermore, the malignant T cells in this disease express readily detectable products encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus's genes whereas those of EATL are not infected with this virus and therefore do not express these viral products. * Indolent T cell lymphoproliferative disorder of the gastrointestinal tract (ITCLD-GT)) is a rare, slowly progressive, and potentially premalignant disorder of the GI tract that may be mistaken of EATL, particularly with respect to the severity of its symptoms, the gross pathology of its intestinal lesions, and the presence in its intestinal lesions of T cells that have monoclonal rearrangements of their TCR as well as genetic abnormalities in the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Unlike EATL, ITCLD-GT is not associated with coeliac disease; often involves symptomatic lesions of the upper GI tract (i.e. stomach, esophagus, and pharynx); and has GI tract lesions populated by T cells that express CD3 (rather than iCD3), do not express CD56, and, in many cases, express an abnormal STAT3-JAK2 fusion gene.  Prevention  Strict adherence to a gluten-free diet has been shown in some but not all studies to prevent in a significant number of cases the progression of coeliac disease to Type I RCD, Type II RCD, and EATL. For example, an Italian study of 1757 patients found that the morbidity of EATL over 3 years fell from 6.42 to 0.22 in coeliac disease patients kept on a strict gluten-free diet. While two other studies found that the risk of malignancy in the diseases did not fall on this diet, current opinion strongly favors using it in all stages of coeliac disease. Management = Treatment of refractory celiac disease = Efforts have also been made to treat refractory coeliac disease in order to prevent EATL. Treatment with corticosteroids, particularly budesonide gives temporary improvement in symptoms and histological responses in 30-40% of patients but few have attained a good overall response. The addition of azathioprine, cyclosporin, or a monoclonal antibody directed against tumor necrosis factor-Œ± to the corticosteroid regimen, the use, as single agents, of purine analogs (i.e. pentostatin, cladribine) or monoclonal antibody directed against CD52 as well as the use of intensive chemotherapy regimens have shown little therapeutic effects. Furthermore, azathioprine, anti-CD52 antibody, and cladribine have been reported to increase the disease's progression to EATL. In summary, the role these drugs, intensive chemotherapy regimens, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of refractory coeliac disease is unclear and has not been shown to improve, and in some cases may worsen, the chances that Type I and Type II RCD, will progress to EATL. Patients with refractory coeliac disease, especially those with Type II RCD, should be examined at regular intervals for the development of EATL using magnetic resonance imaging, capsule endoscopy, CT scan, and Positron emission tomography;. These examinations should also be used whenever patients with refractory disease experience worsening symptoms. = Treatment of EATL = In eligible patients, surgery where necessary (required in >80% of patients) to repair obstructed or perforated bowel or remove bulky disease followed by a conditioning regimen of high-dose chemotherapy (usually the CHOP regimen) and autologous stem cell transplantion has been the mainstay of treating EATL. Previous chemotherapy treatment regimens that did not use autologous stem cell transplantation reported poor prognoses with overal survival, progression free, and mortality rates over a 5-year period of 22%, 3%, and 81%. respectively whereas a regimen that included intensive chemotherapy, conditioning, and autologous stem cell transplantation had rates of 60%, 52%, and 39%, respectively. Research = Clinical trials = A phase 2 study sponsored by the Imagine Institutehttp://www.institutimagine.org/en/imagine- institute.html and being conducted in Paris, France is recruiting patients to examine the efficacy and side effects of a new treatment regimen on EATL. The regimen consists of treatment with brentuximab vedotin plus CHP (i.e. (cyclophosphamide, Adriamycin, prednisone) followed by consolidation chemotherapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Brentuximab vedotin is a chimeric monoclonal antibody that is complexed to the antimitotic agent, monomethyl auristatin E; the drug binds to the cell- membrane protein CD30 to deliver thereby the antimitotic aged into CD30-bearing target cells. This study is based on a phase 1 study finding that a regimen consisting of brentuximab vedotin plus CHP achieved objective responses in all 26 patients tested, with complete remissions obtained in the only patient with EATL, all 6 patients with ALCL, and 16 of 19 patients with other types of T-cell/NK-cell lymphomas.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03217643?cond=Enteropathy- associated+T-cell+lymphoma&rank;=1 A phase 1 study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center is recruiting patients that have CD30-expressing lymphomas such as EATL to examine the effects of a conditioning drug regimen (i.e. cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) followed by infusions of the patients' chimeric antigen receptor T cells that have been modified to target and destroy cells bearing CD30.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03049449?cond=Enteropathy- associated+T-cell+lymphoma&rank;=3 A phase 1 study sponsored by the NIH and Mayo Clinic USA is recruiting patients with peripheral T-cell lymphomas, including EATL, to study the efficacy and toxicity of nivolumab. Nivolumab is monoclonal antibody checkpoint inhibitor that binds to the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) thereby blocking this protein from being activated by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1). Many types of cancer cells increase their expression of PD-LI in order to inhibit immune cells that express PD-1 from killing them. Nivolumab blocks this inhibition and has been found effective in suppressing the growth of certain cancers.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03075553?cond=Enteropathy- associated+T-cell+lymphoma&rank;=6 = Clinical trials = A recently completed Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group study evaluated the efficacy and safety of a monoclonal antibody (termed AMG 714) directed against IL-15 in adult patients with Type II RCD.https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02633020?cond=refractory+celiac+disease&rank;=1 The study found potential therapeutic effects of the treatment in that it halted the malignant progression of IEL in these patients.

The main route climbs through what is now the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, with a branch in Chatsworth Park South. It was an important artery linking the Los Angeles Basin and inland Ventura County and as such, was part of the main route for travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities in 1876. The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Part of the stage road is also a Historic-Cultural Monument of Ventura County and of the City of Los Angeles under the name Old Stagecoach Trail. History In 1859, the California Legislature appropriated $15,000 for improving an old wagon road through the Santa Susana Pass. Additional funding was provided by the Counties of Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 disrupted mail service along the Butterfield Overland Mail's southern stagecoach route from St. Louis, Missouri via El Paso, Fort Yuma and Los Angeles and on to San Francisco via the Tejon Pass, which had begun its run in 1858. To compensate, the government contracted the Butterfield Company to carry mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via the new wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass. The first overland mail stage run through the pass took place on April 6, 1861.Old Stagecoach Trail at www.trails.comLink, Tom: Universal City - North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait, Windsor Publications, 1991, , p. 25 The new route diverged from the Tejon Pass route at the north end of the Cahuenga Pass, following the old coast road (El camino Viejo, the former El Camino Real to San Buenaventura (Ventura) and Santa Barbara) as far as the Rancho Los Encinos before striking northwest across the San Fernando Valley toward the Santa Susana Pass.The stagecoach routes can clearly be seen on period maps. 1880 manuscript map of the western San Fernando Valley, with the stage route from Rancho Los Encinos to Santa Susana Pass (upper left) highlighted. The precipitous portion of the route on the San Fernando Valley side was called the Devil's Slide; horses were usually blindfolded and chains were used to augment brakes on the steep descent. Passengers debarked and walked. The Santa Susana Pass stagecoach road continued in use as an alternative to the route along El Camino Viejo from 1861 to 1875, replacing the older road as the main route between Los Angeles and San Francisco. William E. Lovett acquired the mail contract in 1867 and carried mail and passengers via the Santa Susana Pass and between Los Angeles and San Diego. In 1876, the Southern Pacific Railroad opened a tunnel through the Newhall Pass, enabling rail connections from Los Angeles north to San Francisco, and rail travel soon replaced travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco. From this time the stagecoach traffic to Santa Barbara once again used the coast route, and the road through Santa Susana Pass was relegated to local traffic. A new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895. Initially called El Camino Nuevo (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until the present Santa Susana Pass Road was built in 1917.\\"Santa Susana Pass Road\\". Google Maps. Retrieved on 2016-01-31. Map of the Stage Road NRHP property (shaded) within Santa Susana State Historic Park. The stage road is shown in red, and a star marks the location of the 1937 commemorative plaque at the base of the Devil's Slide. Hikers in the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park can still see the deep ruts made by the wagons on the 'Devil's Slide' section. A plaque was embedded into the sandstone rock by the Native Daughters of the Golden West in 1939, commemorating the Old Santa Susana Stage Road. A branch of the Santa Susana Pass stagecoach road was designated as Los Angeles Historic- Cultural Monument #92, 'The Old Stagecoach Trail', by the City of Los Angeles on January 5, 1972. A parcel containing the stagecoach road was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The stage route was also declared Ventura County Historical Landmark #104 on October 24, 1986.

Kurisu is the translation of the word cross into Malayalam, the language of Kerala; mala means mountain; ashram means monastery. Hence, the name describes the community of monks who practise austerity and live a strict monastic life on the mount of the Cross in the high hills of Kerala.  The Foundation  It was at the invitation of Zacharias Mar Athanasios, the Bishop of Tiruvalla, that Fr. Francis Mahieu, a Trappist monk from the Scourmont Abbey, in Belgium (later known as Francis Acharya) came to Kerala to start the ashram. In the course of time, Bede Griffiths joined him there. On 1 December 1956, the two of them started the new foundation at Tiruvalla in the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. Eventually they were successful in obtaining of land and on 20 March 1958, the eve of St Benedict‚Äôs day, Fr. Francis, Fr. Bede, and two seminarians traveled sixty miles to the site, high up on the holy mountain of Kurisumala. Well contented with their hilltop, they spent the next few months in a hut made of bamboo and plaited palm leaves with no facilities, no furniture, and a floor covered simply with cow dung. While the center of their lives was the prayer of the Church and celebration of its feasts and mysteries, they had to find a way of supporting themselves, so they soon started a dairy farm with cattle imported from Jersey.  Translation of Liturgical Text  Fr. Bede Griffiths, the eminent scholar and author, spent the last years of his life at Shantivanam in Tamil Nadu. Thus, Fr. Francis Acharya became the lone guiding spirit of the Ashram at Kurisumala. In India he embraced the best aspects of Indian spirituality and culture. It is a measure of his total commitment to local adaptation that he acquired a mastery knowledge of Syriac, the original language of the Malankara Syrian liturgy. He was able to translate from Syriac into English a few of the most important liturgical texts such as the Panqitho, the worship book for feast days throughout the year. In the monastery, the liturgical services are in the Malankara tradition. On an experimental basis, with the official sanction of ecclesiastical authorities, there is an Indianised celebration of the Holy Mass. In this, the chants, ceremonies and symbols are mostly adapted from the Hindu form of worship. This practice bears testimony to the genuine respect and appreciation that Fr. Francis had of Indian culture and religions. He always endeavoured to nurture this attitude in the entire Kurisumala monastic community and to transmit it to the countless devotees of various Christian denominations and other religions who regularly reach the monastery for prayer and meditation. A couple of years before his death, Fr. Francis, who had kept in touch with the monastery of his youth, had the Kurisumala Ashram affiliated to the Trappists.  Demise of Francis Acharya  When Francis Acharya died in the 91st year of his life on 31 January 2002, the esteem and admiration he earned among all sections of people of this country became evident. His funeral was attended by large numbers of people from every caste, class and religion. The large number of religious sisters of various Congregations was particularly conspicuous. They are beneficiaries of the atmosphere and spirit of prayer, silence and mortification at Kurisumala.  Kurisumala Ashram and SEERI  Francis Acharya was very much interested in SEERI (St. Ephrem Ecumenical Research Institute, Kottayam, Kerala, India). He promoted its vision and mission. By sending Syriac prayer books for Lent, Holy week etc. he requested SEERI to bring the unfulfilled dream of Kurisumala into realization- namely the dream of having a community where the West Syriac Liturgy will be faithfully observed in its original language and this liturgical heritage fruitfully studied. In the world Syriac Conferences held in SEERI, he was a much coveted speaker and participant. SEERI had the privilege to publish in its Moran Etho series, the inspirational work of Francis Acharya entitled The clothing ritual of Monks.

It receives this name because it is (unlike any other street in Barcelona) parallel to the Equator (at 41¬∞22‚Ä≤30‚Ä≥ North). It runs from Pla√ßa d'Espanya, where the city's exhibition halls are located, to the seafront, Pla√ßa de la Carbonera and the passenger ship port, dividing the neighbourhood of Poble Sec, on the side of Montju√Øc, from the neighbourhoods of Sant Antoni and El Raval. It was officially inaugurated on October 11, 1894.http://w10.bcn.cat/APPS/nomenclator/frcontent.jsp?idioma=0 El Paral¬∑lel, as the avenue and sometimes the surrounding quarter are called, is most known for theatres (as of 2009, there are three in the avenue, Apolo, Condal and Victoria, but there were many more), as well as cabarets and erotic shows, or the Sala Apolo. In the past it was the core of Barcelona's nightlife, with music halls and other venues, but in the last two decades its importance has diminished greatly, in favour of the city centre and Eixample, and some urban decay is visible. El Molino, once one of the city's most renowned cabarets, is being rebuilt.

Biography Isabel Huggan spent her childhood in Elmira, a small southern Ontario town where her father worked as a manager for the Canadian branch of an American chemical company. She studied English and Philosophy at the University of Western Ontario and in 1965 moved to Toronto to work in publishing. She spent a year traveling in Europe, then returned to Canada and in 1968 began teaching English, Theatre and Creative Writing in Ontario high schools. In 1970 she married journalist Robert Huggan. They lived in Toronto for two years and then bought an old farm house in Belleville in eastern Ontario, where she was a reporter, photographer and columnist for the local newspaper, The Intelligencer, and he was journalism teacher at the local community college. In the mid-1970s she began publishing poetry and short stories in Canadian literary magazines; in 1977, after leaving her job, she gave birth to a daughter. In 1976 Isabel Huggan won first prize in a National Film Board of Canada contest for women scriptwriters for a film script based on her short story \\"Celia Behind Me\\". She contributed two further stories about Elizabeth, the central character in \\"Celia Behind Me\\", for an anthology (First Impressions, Oberon Press, 1980). Another in the same series was published in the annual Oberon Press collection Best Canadian Stories the following year. In 1980, the family moved to Ottawa (where her husband took a job in development communications) and she met with Oberon Press editors who decided to publish her entire eight-story sequence as The Elizabeth Stories (1984). The book received favorable reviews in newspapers and journals across the country, and Huggan, by now in her early 40s, began to be recognized as one of Canada's \\"new writers\\". In 1987, the same year that Bob Huggan was sent to Kenya to work in communications at an international development agricultural research institute, Isabel Huggan saw her book published in Britain and the United States, where it was much acclaimed. The posting in Kenya lasted for three years and was followed by a three-year assignment to another development institute in France, and that led to a five- year stay at the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines. Before leaving France in 1993, Isabel Huggan produced a second collection of short stories You Never Know, which established her international reputation as a writer. Huggan began teaching creative writing in Belleville, and for several years taught for the University of Ottawa and the Ottawa High School Board. She continued to give writing workshops on return visits to Canada, and over several years taught for schools, universities and private writing groups in France, Switzerland, the Philippines, Australia and Hong Kong. In 1998 she joined the Humber School for Writers in Toronto as a staff writer, teaching at summer workshops and mentoring by correspondence, a position she continues to hold. The same year, Huggan and her husband settled in the south of France where they renovated an old stone house during their holidays away from the Philippines, and they remain there. In 2003, after close collaboration with her editor Louise Dennys at Knopf Canada, Huggan brought forward a memoir, Belonging: Home Away from Home, concerning her experiences both in Canada and abroad, combining her personal essays with three short stories in order to show the close relationship between fact and fiction. In the autumn of 2003, after several weeks of travel promoting her book at literary festivals in Canada, Huggan suffered a subdural haematoma and underwent neurosurgery in France, a successful operation that prevented any serious consequences. In 2004, after a promotional trip to Australia (where Belonging had been published and greeted with much enthusiasm) and then to Canada, she again fell ill, with a pulmonary embolism complicated by pleurisy. In the spring of 2005, a meningioma (tumour on the brain) was detected by a routine scan, and removed with no complications. She has returned to good health. In addition to writing, she continues to teach at workshops and schools. She writes and publishes poetry, book reviews, and newspaper travel articles, and contributes to literary journals and anthologies. Writing Eight stories tracing the growth of the child Elizabeth Kessler over a ten-year period during the 1950s was published as The Elizabeth Stories by Oberon Press in 1984, and in 1987 by Viking Penguin in Great Britain and the United States, where it won the Quality Paperback New Voice Award in 1988 as well as the Best Fiction Prize from the Denver Quarterly. The Elizabeth Stories has been translated into French and Spanish: several stories are anthologized in Dutch and Italian as well as often being used in English-language anthologies, especially those for secondary schools and universities. Isabel Huggan's reputation as a short story writer is international. All but two stories of the collection You Never Know (Knopf Canada and Viking Penguin USA, also translated into French) focus on adult experience, and the various settings‚ÄîScotland, France, Canada and Kenya‚Äîreflect Huggan's expanding view of the world and of human nature. These stories were a clear departure from her earlier work, and proved that childhood was not the only territory from which she derived inspiration. Several of these stories have been anthologized since appearing in You Never Know and continue to be used in current collections such as Best Canadian Stories (Penguin Canada, 2007). The process of settling into a new country, learning another language and culture (at the same time as retaining her Canadian identity) forms the basis for Huggan's third book, Belonging: Home Away From Home, a mix of memoir and fiction, published in 2003 by Knopf Canada (and in 2004 by Random House Australia). It immediately received extremely favorable attention from critics and the public. In April 2004, it was awarded the prestigious Charles Taylor Prize for Literary Non-fiction in Canada, and in Australia was for some time on the bestseller list. Belonging has gone into several printings in Canada, due to its popularity with bookclubs and discussion groups. Readers find their own experiences mirrored in the memoir, as Huggan's life story reminds them of their own: moving from one house or city or country to another, making home over and over again ‚Äì this is common to more people now than ever before. Huggan's genius is to tell her story in such a way that she seems to be asking readers to enter an intimate conversation and to ponder their own lives more deeply. Isabel Huggan's stories have been included in several anthologies. Her work appears in Canadian periodicals including Books in Canada, BRICK, Canadian House & Home, Chatelaine, GEO Canada, Harrowsmith, Quarry, The New Quarterly, among others. In the U.S. her work has appeared in Utne Reader and Confetti; in Denmark, Kunapipi; in Australia, in Eureka Street and Meanjin, and in Britain, in Good Housekeeping and Women & Home Magazine. The Atlantis/National Film Board television short film Jack of Hearts was based on her short story of the same name from The Elizabeth Stories. It aired on Global's Bell Canada Playhouse in 1986.

The family originated in the plains of Val Sturla and Val Polcevera in the region of Liguria. In the 12th century the Delle Piane appeared in the ambit of the freeholders, small ‚Äúrural Vassals‚Äù of the Archbishop of Genova, to whom they pay rent and where they gravitate, and as certified, there was the presence of Oberto de Planis de Pulcifera, who appears in the acts of the Curia in 1254, and of Fulco, witnessed in the acts of the Archbishop in 1255. After having recuperated local charges in the 13th century, as ‚ÄúConsuls of the Ceranesi‚Äù, a branch of the dynasty, from the 14th century, militate in the ‚Äúpopulares‚Äù (aristocrats) and between the ‚Äúartifices albi‚Äù partly Ghibelline, participated actively in the government of the ancient council of Genova, with Matteo delle Piane officer of Gazaria (Genoese colonies) in 1313, with Niccolo delle Piane Castellan of Pornassio and of the Valle Arroscia in 1343, Giovanni, Elder of the council in 1362, with Benedetto delle Piane, Castellan of Corvara (Beverino) in 1378, a second Oberto de Planis (de Pulcifera) Elder in 1374, 1386, 1394 and Knight of the Doge in 1380, Giacobo Adviser in 1382 and Elder in 1390, Antonio Elder in 1401 and Abbot of the Podesteria (Podest√†) of Voltri in 1404, Bertone Adviser and member of the monetary office in 1427, Bartolomeo Adviser in 1518. Following the constitutional reform in 1528 some Delle Piane having ‚Äúopen houses‚Äù in Genova and belonging to several branches were registered in the ‚ÄúLiber Civilitatis‚Äù Liber Nobilitatis (Libro d‚ÄôOro della Nobilta Italiana) and in Albergo De Franchi in 1528/1531 and in Albergo Cybo in 1566/1568 (they were one of the 35 families registered in the aristocratic corporation that had access to the charges of the republic). Other branches of the family originated and descended from Antonio (di Fegino), that lived ‚Äúmore nobilium‚Äù in Polcevera, as ‚Äúprimaries and principles‚Äù, transferred to Novi Ligure at the end of the 18th century, remembering Stefano, who in 1564 founded the gentilitial family tomb in the benedictine Abbey of San Nicolo del Boschetto in Rivarolo; the magnificent Giovanni Battista Abbot of the Polcevera in 1582, the rev. di D Francesco and D. Giuseppe, that again in 1768 pay investiture to the ecclesiastical mess of Genova for there lands and properties of Le Folle in San Quirico Tuscany. Giovanni Maria (1756‚Äì1836) was nominated Captain of the Terzo of Busseto and of the first company of the militia of Monticelli in 1799 by the Duke Ferdinand of Parma. He descended from the celebrated court painter Giovanni Maria delle Piane descending from another branch from the Polcevera. The Delle Piane were granted various coat of arms with a Lion and a band for military service in the medieval ages and then other coat of arms with a coronet with eight pearls of the title of nobility of Nobile and a fortuna goddess standing on a globe, (or with a wheel of fortune or a ship's wheel, holding a ship's sail) to symbolise the watermills they owned or their marine activities in the Renaissance, the honorary titles of nobility of Dominus and of Nobile were conferred to some branches and members of the family. Slowly, throughout the XIX century, members of this house have almost ceased to use the courtesy title of Nobile di Polcevera. The Delle Piane are also renowned for their contributions during the Renaissance to Ligurian history and to the business environment. Beginning in the 16th century their family businesses included banking, watermills and textiles. Through these business endeavors they achieved nobility status. For 700 years the Delle Piane were considered as one of the prominent families in Liguria and were recognized as nobility because of their success in business and their wealth, their successful business enterprises elevated them to the highest social strata. The Delle Piane are also landowners, they purchased several Italian estates, country houses, ville and palazzi in the region of Liguria. The noble Milanese branch of the family also built a villa with a park in the style of a castle in the renaissance in the Italian Riviera. The Delle Piane were also buried in the local churches and in the church of San Cipriano di Serra Ricco. The Delle Piane married other noble families including the De Castello (Castellesi), Castello, Martelli, Gavotti, Centurione, Balbi, Cambiaso, Musso-Piantelli e i Barbieri. The family, divided in various branches, in the line that we give the descent here, were received with proof of nobility in the ceto of the knights of Jure Sanquinis in S.M.O. Cost. Di S.

Their poems are self-written and are often based on personal experiences, focussing on social and political issues relevant to the Asian American community and aiming to challenge common misconceptions of Asianness. The performances are often aggressive and include frequent swearing, but also include wit and humor. Career =Formation= The group was originally a trio, along with former member Sapna Shah. Shah is of Indian descent, Vilayphonh is Lao, and Myers is mixed-race Korean American. They met at a writing workshop in Philadelphia in 2000 at the Asian Arts Initiative. Their first group poem, I'm a Woman Not a Flava, about misappropriation of Asian culture as well as sexual stereotypes placed on Asian females, was originally a solo poem written by Mejier. They first performed the piece in September 2000 at the Asian Arts Initiative. They adopted the name Black Hair, Brown Eyes, Yellow Rage when they performed I'm A Woman Not a Flava at the Russell Simmons' Def Poetry Slam in December 2000 in Philadelphia. The group made the semi-finals, and were asked by the Def Poetry producers to audition for another show in New York City, which they won. In February 2001, along with Taylor Mali, Jessica Care Moore, Black Ice, and Steve Colman, they performed in Aspen, Colorado at the HBO U.S. Comedy Arts Festival, gaining a standing ovation, footage of which was used as the television pilot for the HBO Series Def Poetry. After this, Shah left the group to focus on her medical studies. Myers and Vilayphonh continued as a duo, shortening the name to Yellow Rage. In late summer 2001 they performed for HBO's Russell Simmons Def Poetry Jam, the first Asian American women to be filmed on the show. They performed Listen Asshole, remixed into a group poem, based on Vilayphonh's experience speaking Lao in public with her mother and Myers' experience of being mis-identified, which first aired in December 2001. =Performances= Yellow Rage has performed all over the U.S. including at the 2001 APIA Spoken Word Summit in Seattle and the 2001 NY International Fringe Festival in the show Asians Misbehavin. In August 2002, the Leeway Foundation awarded Yellow Rage a Windows of Opportunity Grant which enabled them to travel to Oahu, Hawaii where they performed for the local poetry organization/collective Wordstew and attended the Globalization Research Center's Trafficking of Asian Women and Children Conference. They took part in Philadelphia Ladyfest in March 2003. They have performed alongside many other artists including Ursula Rucker, Pharoahe Monch, Native Guns, The Pacifics, Chops, Dave Chappelle, Beau Sia, Bao Phi, I Was Born With Two Tongues, Danny Hoch, and Black Ice. Discography They have released two spoken word albums, Black Hair, Brown Eyes, Yellow Rage, Vol. 1 in 2002 and Vol. 2 Handle with Care.

It is almost entirely given over to western rock lobster fishers' camps, and as a result is far more disturbed than most other islands in the archipelago. A nearby island also seasonally populated by fishers is named Little Pigeon Island, hence Pigeon Island is sometimes referred to as \\"Big Pigeon Island\\". History The geographic location of Pigeon Island suggests that it might have been visited by survivors of the 1629 Batavia shipwreck, but there is no surviving evidence of this, either documentary or archaeological. It was mined for guano in the 20th century. Geography Pigeon Island is roughly triangular in shape, with a short side on the south west, and two long sides coming together at a point in the north east. The island is covered with infrastructure, with a high density of huts covering the entire island, right down to the water line; in total there are 54 camps, a school and a pub. There are also around 20 jetties, mainly along the northwest side, as this is the only direction from which the island may be approached by boat. The island is surrounded by reef to the south and east, but a passage known as Pigeon Island Anchorage runs along the northwest side. Geology and physiography The basement of Pigeon Island is the Wallabi Limestone, a dense calcretised, coral limestone platform that underlies the entire Wallabi Group. This platform, which arises abruptly from a flat shelf, is about 40 metres thick, and is of Quaternary origin. Reef that formed during the Eemian interglacial (about 125,000 years ago), when sea levels were higher than at present, are now emergent in places, and constitute the basement of the group's \\"central platform\\" islands, of which Pigeon Island is one. Flora 71 species of plant have been recorded on Pigeon Island, of which 45 are native and 29 introduced. These are: * Acanthocarpus preissii * Actites megalocarpa (dune thistle) * Anagallis arvensis (pimpernel) (naturalised) * Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) * Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush) * Atriplex sp. * Austrostipa elegantissima * Avena barbata (bearded oat) (naturalised) * Brachyscome ciliaris * Bromus arenarius (sand brome) * Bromus diandrus (great brome) (naturalised) * Bromus hordeaceus (soft brome) (naturalised) * Bryophyllum delagoense (mother of millions) (naturalised) * Bulbine semibarbata (leek lily) * Capparis spinosa (coastal caper) * Carpobrotus virescens (coastal pigface) * Conyza bonariensis (flaxleaf fleabane) (naturalised) * Cotyledon orbiculata * Cynodon dactylon (couch) (naturalised) * Daucus glochidiatus (Australian carrot) * Dianella revoluta (blueberry lily) * Diplolaena grandiflora (wild rose) * Disphyma crassifolium subsp. clavellatum (round-leaved pigface) * Ehrharta longiflora (annual veldt grass) (naturalised) * Emex australis (doublegee) (naturalised) * Enchylaena tomentosa (barrier saltbush) * Eragrostis dielsii (mallee lovegrass) * Erodium cicutarium (common storksbill) (naturalised) * Erodium cygnorum (blue heronsbill) * Euphorbia boophthona (Gascoyne spurge) * Euphorbia tannensis * Euphorbia terracina (Geraldton carnation weed) (naturalised) * Exocarpos aphyllus (leafless ballart) * Frankenia pauciflora (seaheath) * Haloragis trigonocarpa * Hordeum murinum subsp. leporinum (barley grass) (naturalised) * Juncus bufonius (toad rush) (naturalised) * Lactuca saligna (wild lettuce) (naturalised) * Malva parviflora (marshmallow) (naturalised) * Malva preissiana (Australian hollyhock) * Medicago polymorpha (burr medic) (naturalised) * Mesembryanthemum crystallinum (iceplant) (naturalised) * Muellerolimon salicorniaceum * Myoporum insulare (blueberry tree) * Nicotiana glauca (tree tobacco) (naturalised) * Nicotiana occidentalis subsp. hesperis (native tobacco) * Nitraria billardierei (bitre bush) * Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy bush) * Phalaris minor (lesser canary grass) (naturalised) * Pimelea microcephala (shrubby riceflower) * Pittosporum phillyreoides (weeping pittosporum) * Plantago debilis * Polycarpon tetraphyllum (fourleaf allseed) (naturalised) * Polypogon tenellus * Rhagodia baccata (berry saltbush) * Rhagodia latifolia * Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish) (naturalised) * Rostraria cristata (naturalised) * Sarcostemma viminale subsp. australe * Schenkia australis (naturalised) * Senecio pinnatifolius * Setaria dielsii (Diels' pigeon grass) * Solanum nigrum (black berry nightshade) * Sonchus oleraceus (common sow thistle) (naturalised) * Spergularia rubra (sand spurry) (naturalised) * Sporobolus virginicus (marine couch) * Tamarix aphylla (athel tree) (naturalised) * Tecticornia arbuscula * Tecticornia halocnemoides (shrubby samphire) * Threlkeldia diffusa (coast bonefruit) * Thysanotis patersonii * Triglochin centrocarpa * Vulpia myuros (rat's tail fescue) (naturalised) Fauna The island's fauna includes the rare spiny-tailed skink, the Abrolhos painted button-quail and the brush bronzewing. The black rat (Rattus rattus) was previously present but has been eradicated. Human uses The Houtman Abrolhos is wholly vested in Western Australia's Minister for Fisheries for purposes of \\"Conservation of Flora and Fauna, Tourism, and for Purposes Associated with the Fishing Industry\\". Pigeon Island is one of a small number of islands given over almost entirely to the last of these. As a result of guano mining in the 19th century, and the development of fishing infrastructure in the 20th century, the island has very little conservation value.

The game has over 141,000 registered players from 100 different countries that can play the game in English, Spanish, Danish, Portuguese, German, French and Dutch. As of March 2016, 149 rounds have been completed. Miniconomy is free to play, but a premium membership is available. This membership allows for the creation of Miniconomy Ventures (MV) with which harbors, banks, and garages can be built, enables the player to start a political party, and gives the player personal smilies and colors on the forums (ingame incorporated as clubs) as well as twice the length of posts in clubs and unlimited number of lots that may be owned. History The idea for Miniconomy came in October 2001 when then computer science student Wouter Leenards started thinking about making a realistic trading simulation game. Together with his brother, Mark Leenards, he further developed the plan, and eventually created Miniconomy. Supported by Mark and some friends, he developed the idea further. Mark, being a business administration student, focused on the economic aspects of the game, whereas Wouter did the programming. The result is a unique online game for everybody who is interested in trading, economics and games. The advantage of Miniconomy is that it can be played on your web browser, so with any internet connection; at home, in the office, at school or at a friend's house. The first public round of Miniconomy started on January 1, 2002. The original idea, a game where economy is simulated, sprung from a combination of imagination and the strengths of other well known game concepts. In most games, however, trading and all its characteristics is not the key. In Miniconomy the trading is the key, and therefore has realistic situations. Monopolies, price fixing, shortage, threats, robbery and abuse of power occur. The first rounds were beta testing where bugs were found and loopholes were used to create imbalance in the game. However, during this time, the game grew exponentially, reaching 2000 active players and 5000 activated accounts within the first four months. The fact that the game grew so quickly and that server costs were rising to facilitate the bandwidth for this increase in players, something needed to be thought of to make sure that the game wasn't making big losses. To do this, a Premium Member system was developed. The benefits of this were at this time: a daily salary, entry to the Casino, the ability to post smileys and use color codes on the forums, the ability to start political parties, and the ability to start companies that could build harbors and banks. At this time the brothers were frequently approached to ponder a way to apply the game in the school system, and so the brothers applied for different grants that existed for funding the creation of education systems. It was not until they got the Digitale Pioneers grant, a temporary action program that is meant for innovative grass-root Internet initiatives. This fund gives financial and organizational support to small-scale grass root content communities that realize innovative projects in the public domain on the Internet,Program Digitale Pioneers that they were able to make the Educational Manager, which allowed teachers to monitor the actions of students and give them the tools needed to accurately grade them. In November 2005, Miniconomy decided to start actively targeting the international markets. To do this an international country was made inside the game where the official language was English and a complete translation of the game was made into English by a volunteer. The country has been growing, with besides a large number of Dutch players, also reaching 150 active players from the United States at the end of round 49 in January 2008.History of Miniconomy As of today, Miniconomy has over 14,000 registered users from the US, just over 4,000 from the United Kingdom and a core of active Danish players, with over 500 registered accounts. The Dutch speaking community still is quite dominant in the statistics, with over 63,000 accounts registered from Belgium and the Netherlands. These figures handle registered accounts, not active accounts and that the actual number of active players per round averages around 1,000. General information In Miniconomy, the player starts with 1000 I-Shell, (the Miniconomy currency) 100 liters of gasoline and 10 skill points, which he can use to specialize in the production and sale of products. There is also a possibility to start a Miniconomy Corporation, an actual second, third, etc. business (only available when you are a PM member). You become a Premium Member by purchasing it via credits, a currency that can be purchased with real money. Miniconomy has rounds which last three weeks, with one week breaks in between them allowing for new political positions to be chosen and for the implementation of new features by the Federals & Wouter (the actual game masters). Miniconomy also has special trading rounds 1‚Äì2 times a year were traders are given certain tasks or goals to achieve. An example of this is a round were the team with the most I-Shells wins. =Trading= The main part of Miniconomy is trading. Players can choose to trade in 29 products and can get their turnover from intercity trade, intracity trade, international trade, and exports and NPC Tourists. Players can build shops in their hometown, buy shops in other cities or countries, and can dress these up with (animated) banners, increase the marketing so that their shop is more prominent on one of the streets, and add discounts for certain customers. At the end of the round the trade rankings, based on the net worth of players, are used to appoint a winner. =Geographic distribution= The game was launched in the Netherlands, and was initially only available to Dutch players; Miniconomy has a large number of European players compared to those of other continents. The Netherlands, Belgium and the United States are the nations with the largest number of players, but just recently, player totals in North America have known a steady growth, with nearly 10,000 registered users and several hundred active every round.http://www.miniconomy.nl/statistics/countries.php Game structure Miniconomy consists of four countries (Virtua, Digitalie, Cyberie, and Ibisha) each have their own forms of government and structure and laws. Players are expected to obey their countries local laws as well as international laws. Each country may have their own court system, although some choose not to use a traditional court system. Appeals from National Courts or lawsuits against players of other countries are held in the International Court, which is the highest court of the Federation, and is led by a chair appointed by the High Council. Leaders of countries may participate in the Federal Union, which serves as an organization for international discussions, including changing some international laws. This is the highest political organization of the Federation. Community Miniconomy has a very strong and tight community. Although not all players are socially active, some activities do promote activity between players. The easiest way to sell products for example is through the buildup of network of frequent customers. Although most informal communication takes place via the chat and via WhatsApp, there are some other in-game forms of communication. =Clubs= Clubs are the internet forums in Miniconomy. Different sub forums are available after someone builds a club and the players joins it. All club owners are automatically administrator of the club, and have the ability to appoint three moderators. Politics and game announcements also take place through clubs, and it is the preferred way of communication in Miniconomy. The possibility of private clubs, protected by a password, also allow for political parties, newspaper publishers, and volunteers to chat within the game without having to resort to outside communication tools. =Newspapers= Miniconomy has one official newspaper, the Miniconomist, which publishes every week in Dutch. Besides this newspaper, there are also other newspapers, created by players themselves. All the newspapers can be found by going to the kiosk in Miniconomy.Newspapers, websites, forums and articles about Miniconomy =Miniconomeetings= About once every 3‚Äì4 months there will be held a Miniconomeeting. Currently only Dutch and Belgian players organize these kind of meetings of which there have been a few dozen so far. The last meeting took place in Amsterdam on 27 December 2014 and had many attendees. On average about 10 to 20 players attend these meetings, coming from anywhere in the two countries. =Administrative staff and volunteers= There are several different administrative and volunteer functions, these are: * Federals, Wouter, Remco ‚Äì These are the game masters and the development team of Miniconomy. The Federals are divided into four roles: Federal Manager, Federal Assistant, Federal Coordinator, Federal Researcher. Federals are appointed from the playerbase, the exacts are unknown but it is speculated the Federals decide whom to appoint in consultation with Wouter, the game's owner. * Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) agent ‚Äì This is the anti-cheat team of Miniconomy. They check all financial transactions to make sure no one breaks the game rules. These agents are players appointed by the Federals and Wouter. * Assistant ‚Äì These are the administrators of the in- game chat. They also help new players with the game since they are easily recognizable on the chat. Assistants are appointed by Head Assistant in consolidation with the Federals. * Editor ‚Äì They are responsible for posting to the Newsfeed as well as adding tweets to Twitter. Some examples of requests would be announcements by a National Government. Editors are appointed by the Head Editor in consolidation with the Federals. * Recruiter ‚Äì Recruiters are part of a group of volunteers who seek to bring new players, keep new and old players alike by promoting the game by doing tasks. * Expert ‚Äì These volunteers each have an area of specialty for which players can request more information about. * High Council ‚Äì A group of six experienced players that work as an advisory team for the Federals, Wouter and the Federal Union. Five are appointed by the Federals in Consolidation with the Federals, while the sixth is the International Court Chair who is appointed by the High Council. The High Council is the highest judicature organization in the Federation. * Federal Union - A group of eight players and a chairman/woman consisting of delegations of two players from each country of the Federation, this group can make changes to certain laws in the International lawbook and make suggestions and recommendations to the High Council and Federals. This is the highest political organization in the Federation. Miniconomy in the classroom The educational changes make it possible to play Miniconomy with a group of players, like a class of students. The participants will play the regular game like all other players and since you cannot tell them from regular players, they will blend completely into the society itself. Student accounts however won't be allowed to partake in criminal activities such as shooting and stealing. The group leader can follow his or her class almost with every move they make. To not lose oversight or control, teachers can therefore follow the activities of the students and help them on their way. The group leaders can also see the balance sheets and income statements of all students. The group leader also gets a Miniconomy account, which he or she can use to take a look into the world of Miniconomy and even trade or compete with the students or the other players if they would like. Minoconomy is primarily developed for students in middle school or higher, and especially for the subjects economics, management and organisation, and math. The game also lends itself well for aspects in the society for social studies. =Educational Manager= In 2005 the Educational Manager was created, which allows teachers to follow every step of their students' progress within the game. Eighteen schools have participated since then,School participation in Miniconomy with positive feedback. At the moment is only possible for Dutch schools to use this feature, but the English translations of the Educational Manager are in full progress and the possibility for the use of Miniconomy in the classroom using the English language are expected to be ready after the summer of 2008. The age groups where Miniconomy matches the curriculum are between 12 and 20, due to the general developments that students get in the field of language, economics, communication, and politics.

It is defined as a formal specification language, formulated as an axiomatized subset of First-order predicate logic. A diagram in LePUS3 is also called a Codechart.Codechart, formal definition LePUS, the name of the first version of the language, is an abbreviation for Language for Pattern Uniform Specification.  Purpose  LePUS3 is tailored for the following purposes: * Scalability: To model large-scale programs using small Codecharts with only few symbols * Automated verifiability: To allow programmers to check fully automatically conformance to design so as to keep the design in synch with the implementation * Program visualization: To allow tools to reverse-engineer legible Codecharts from plain source code modeling their design * Pattern implementation: To allow tools to determine automatically whether your program implements a design pattern * Design abstraction: To specify unimplemented programs without committing prematurely to implementation minutiae * Generality: To model a design pattern not as a specific implementation but as a design motif * Rigour: To allow software designers to be sure exactly what Codecharts represent and reason rigorously about them  Context  LePUS3 belongs to the following families of languages: * Object-oriented software modeling languages (e.g., UML): LePUS3 is a visual notation that is used to represent the building-blocks in the design of programs object-oriented programming languages * Formal specification languages: Like other Logic Visual Languages, Codecharts articulate sentences in mathematical logic. LePUS3 is axiomatized in and defined as a recursive (turing-decidable) subset of first-order predicate calculus. Its semantics are defined using finite structure (mathematical logic). * Architecture description languages: LePUS3 is a non-functional specification language used to represent design decisions about programs in class-based object-oriented programming languages (such as Java and C++). * Tool supported specification languages: Verification of Codecharts (checking their consistency with a Java 1.4 program) can be established ('verified') by a click of a button, as demonstrated by the Two-Tier Programming Toolkit. * Software visualization notations are notations which offer a graphical representation of the program, normally generated by reverse-engineering the source code of the program.  Vocabulary  LePUS3 was designed to accommodate for parsimony and for economy of expression. Its vocabulary consists of only 15 visual tokens. LePUS3 Vocabulary  Tool support  The Two-Tier Programming ToolkitTwo-Tier Programming Toolkit can be used to * create LePUS3 specifications (Codecharts) * verify automatically the consistency of LePUS3 Codecharts with Java 1.4 programs; and * reverse- engineer Codecharts from Java source code. Design patterns LePUS3 was specifically designed to model, among others, the 'Gang of Four' design patterns, including abstract factory, factory method, adapter, decorator, composite, proxy, iterator, state, strategy, template method, and visitor. (See \\"The 'Gang of Four' Companion\\") The abbreviation LePUS for \\"Language for Pattern Uniform Specification\\" is used because the precursor of this language was primarily concerned with design patterns. The implementation of design patterns specified in LePUS3 can be automatically verified by the TTP Toolkit.  Examples  LePUS3 is particularly suitable for modelling large programs, design patterns, and object-oriented application frameworks. It is unsuitable for modelling non object-oriented programs, architectural styles, and undecidable and semi-decidable properties.

The delta region is densely populated, and plays a dominant role in the cultivation of rice in rich alluvial soil as low as just 3 metres above sea level, although it also includes fishing communities in a vast area full of rivers and streams. On 2 May 2008, the delta suffered a major disaster, devastated by Cyclone Nargis, which reportedly killed at least 77,000 people with over 55,900 missing, and left about 2.5 million homeless.\\"Myanmar death toll soars, devastation 'huge' \\" Reuters 17 May 2008 Geography =Arms and terrain= The Irrawaddy Delta comprises the main arms of Pathein River, Pyapon River, Bogale River, and Toe River. Mawtin Point, formerly Cape Negrais, is a famous landmark in the Irrawaddy Division, and it also marks the south west end of Myanmar. The highest point of the delta, Waphu Mount lies between Pathein and Mawtin Zun (point), on the western strip of the delta. A major portion of the area is covered with low-lying lands just 3m above sea level. This alluvial plain is bounded to the west by the Rakhine Yoma and to the east by the Bago Yoma. It is dissected into peninsulas and islands by the large southward flowing rivers which are subject to tidal intrusion. The lower seaward third of the delta is completely flat with no local relief and stretches for 130 km from east to west. The waters of these rivers are very turbid due to a heavy silt load they carry and the sea is very shallow with depths less than 5.5 m across the coastline and in the east for a distance of up to 28 km offshore. As a result of constant accretion into the sea, the delta is advancing at a rate of 5‚Äì6 km per 100 years, equivalent to about 1,000 hectares per year. =Climate= Annual rainfall in the delta region is approximately 2,500 mm (100 in), with a mean temperatures of 32 ¬∞C (90 ¬∞F). Most of the rain falls during the monsoons between mid-May and mid-November. It is cool and dry from mid-October to mid- February when temperatures begin to rise with premonsoon squalls in April and early May. =Ecosystems= Water purity lies within the pH range of alkaline condition due to early natural resources and weak environmental control. Mangroves or lamu and nipa palm or dani are the major vegetation of the delta. Moreover, control of weeds is less active as local farmers make mats during the summer. Destruction of mangroves and deforestation in the coastal region due to the Cyclone Nargis put it more at risk in future.,.\\"IMangrove destruction partly to blame for Myanmar toll: ASEAN chief\\" , Google News, 6 May 2008\\"Mangrove loss 'put Burma at risk'\\", BBC News, 6 May 2008 = River banks = = Islands = The principal islands include Haingyi Kyun, Leit Kyun (Turtle Island), Pyin Salu Kyun, and Meinmahla Kyun (Pretty Women Island). = Major cities = Major cities include Bogale, Maubin, Myaungmya, Moulmeingyun, Pantanaw, Pathein, Pyapon, Dedaye up to Twante, and Kyauktan. = Canals = There is no extensive system of irrigation or water transport canals except Twante Canal, constructed during the colonial period. It is much beneficial to the delta region for communication and commerce through water transportation with Yangon. Delta culture hence shifted to Yangon, its influence evident in places and products such as Bogale Market, Mortin Quarter, Yay Kyaw Quarter, Danubyu Restaurants, Pathein Halawa (halva dessert), Tinphyu mats from Pantanaw, and Pathein umbrella.  History  The delta was historically populated by the Mon. Politically, the Burman kingdoms in farther north of the Irrawaddy River had controlled the delta area since the mid-11th century with few exceptions. The control of the fertile area reverted to Bago-based Mon kingdoms in the 13th to 15th centuries (1287‚Äì1539) and briefly in the 18th century (1747‚Äì1757). The delta was also where the British first got a toe-hold in Burma. The British seized Haingyi Kyun or Negrais Island in 1753, after the Mon resisted their request to establish a trading post. The Burmese king Alaungpaya ceded the island to the British in 1757, but retook the island in 1759 by force when the king felt he had been betrayed by the British in his war against the Mon. The battle of Danubyu in 1825 in the delta was the last major stand by the Burmese against the advancing British forces in the First Anglo-Burmese War (1824‚Äì1826). The delta was seized by the British in the Second Anglo-Burmese War of 1852 and became part of British Burma. The British colonial administration drained the marshes and swamps that dominated the area, and built dykes and embankments starting from 1861 for rice cultivation as the Burmans began to migrate south into British Burma in search of greener pastures. Now, 1,300 km of major embankments in the delta protect 600,000 hectares of paddyland. Inhabitants It is mainly populated by farming and fishing communities in several villages besides market towns, mostly located along the main rivers. At 100 per km2, it is one of the most densely populated regions in the country with a total population of 3.5 million. Current inhabitants include, apart from the Mon and Bamar, a majority Pwo Kayin.  Economy and development  The region is Myanmar's largest rice producer, so its infrastructure of road transportation has been greatly developed during the 1990s and 2000s. Two- thirds of the total arable land is under rice cultivation with a yield of about 2,000‚Äì2,500 kg per hectare. Fishing is carried out from fixed fishing frames as well as from small boats. Prawn fishery and harvesting sea turtle eggs are also major commercial activities both of which are now threatened by the loss of mangrove forests as clearing of land proceeds for agriculture. Since communication throughout the delta is easiest by water, almost every household possesses a boat and major towns such as Bogale, Mawlamyinegyun and Myaungmya are served by steamer.  National heritage sites and nature reserves Meinmahla Kyun Reservation is a national heritage site as well as a natural habitat to many mangrove forests and diverse sea life. The Irrawaddy dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris) is not a true river dolphin native to the Delta region, but it was named after the river, and these sea dolphins are known to enter the rivers of South East Asia.

A right-handed batsman, Khaleel made his first-class debut in 2002. In 2007, he opted to participate in the now defunct Indian Cricket League, competing for the Hyderabad Heroes. He returned to authorised cricket in 2009, returning to play for Hyderabad. In a 2011 Ranji Trophy match against Assam, he set a record for the most dismissals in a first-class match by a wicket-keeper; taking 14 in total. Career Having played for Hyderabad's youth teams at Under-16 and Under-19 level, he made his first-class cricket debut for the team in November 2002, facing Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy match. He took five catches in the first innings of the contest, and two further catches and a stumping in the second. In late 2005, Khaleel reached his first century in first-class cricket, remaining 128 not out against Andhra. He followed this up with another century in his next match, reaching 102 in the second innings against Punjab. Later that month, he bettered his debut performance with the gloves, taking nine catches in a match against Services. He chose to participate in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) for the duration of its existence, ruling him out of international selection, or participation in any cricket authorised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). He was part of the Hyderabad Heroes side which won the ICL 20s Grand Championship 2007‚Äì08, and the ICL India XI which won the ICL 20s World Series 2007‚Äì08. When the BCCI offered an amnesty for ICL players to return to first-class cricket, Khaleel joined the majority of his colleagues in accepting the offer, and made his return for Hyderabad in November 2009. He bettered his previous best with the bat in late 2010, scoring 141 runs in the first innings against Jharkhand, sharing a partnership of 175 runs with Bavanaka Sandeep in the process.

He was promoted to lieutenant in 1723, captain in 1727, major in 1740, lieutenant-colonel in 1743. It was in 1746 that he is said to have won the favour of the King. A military expedition was being planned, and it was widely believed that its destination was to be Canada. The King questioning the officers when they would be ready to embark, several of them asked for a few weeks leave of absence; but when the King turned to Holmes, he replied \\"Tomorrow, and whenever your Majesty should require my service.\\" He was immediately promoted to Colonel in charge of a regiment of marines, and duly served in the planned action, although it turned out that it was only to be an assault on the coast of Brittany. Holmes remained a favourite of George II. In 1749, he was appointed Colonel of the 31st Foot, nicknamed the \\"Young Buffs\\". He was further promoted to Major- General in 1756 and Lieutenant-General in 1759. His older brother Thomas was the government's election manager on the Isle of Wight, eventually rewarded with an Irish peerage for his services and being allowed almost complete control over the nomination of MPs for five of the island's six Parliamentary seats. In 1741, Henry was elected at Thomas's instigation for Newtown; after one Parliament, he transferred to Yarmouth, which he represented for the rest of his life. He was also appointed lieutenant-governor of the Isle of Wight, in 1754. He died in 1762. He had married Anne, the daughter of Nicholas Lysaght of Mountnorth, co. Cork, but had no children. Holmes's younger brother, Charles Holmes, was also an Isle of Wight MP and a distinguished naval leader, third in command during Wolfe's capture of Quebec.

On September 10, a tropical depression developed a short distance south-southeast of the Mexican Riviera. Slowly intensifying, Fuasto paralleled the coastline. It became a hurricane on September 12, and after briefly reaching major hurricane intensity, increasing wind shear resulted in a weakening trend. It moved ashore Baja California Sur on September 13 as minimal hurricane, and struck the mainland the next day. On September 15, the tropical cyclone was no more. While of rain was recorded, only one person was killed and damage was light.  Meteorological history  The origins of Fausto can be traced back to an area of disturbed weather that was located over Venezuela on August 31. This area of disturbed weather was the southern part of a tropical wave which became Hurricane Fran in the Atlantic Ocean. The disturbed weather moved westward across Central America on September 4 and to a position centered about south of Acapulco, Mexico on September 9, where it began to develop a low-level circulation and well- organized thunderstorm activity. A tropical depression formed on September 10 while located about south-southeast of Manzanillo. Upon becoming a tropical cyclone, the depression was initially forecast to remain over water. Guided by a weak ridge near Baja California, the depression moved northwestward at about 20 km/h (10 mph) and paralleled the coast of Mexico for the next three days. Meanwhile, the tropical cyclone developed well-defined banding features. Based on this, the system was upgraded into Tropical Storm Fausto later that day. While banding featured increased and the tropical cyclone became more organized and a well-established upper-level outflow, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) re-assessed the intensity at 70 mph (195 km/h). Fausto ultimately developed an eye; as such, the tropical storm was upgraded into a hurricane on September 11. Hurricane Fuasto reached its peak intensity at 120 mph (195 km/h) midday on the 12th, and turned northward while centered south of the southern tip of Baja California. The hurricane made landfall near Todos los Santos on Baja California on September 13 with winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), and turned north-northeastward, it made landfall on the mainland of Mexico near Los Mochis several hours later as a weaker hurricane. Fausto rapidly weakened and dissipated on 0000 UTC on September 15 over the Sierra Madre mountains.  Preparations and impact  Rainfall totals from Fausto in Mexico The southern part of Baja California went under a hurricane watch and a tropical storm warning on September 12. The next day, a hurricane warning was issued for the same areas. That night a hurricane watch was issued for the mainland of Mexico. On the September 14, all the warnings were dropped. Fourteen ports throughout Mexico were closed due to the storm. An estimated 5,000 residents evacuated to 110 shelters set up by officials. Following the substantial loss of life due to Hurricane Ismael in 1995, port officials urged, and sometimes pressured, to return to port. Many flights were canceled. Waves of up to walloped Pacific beaches along the southern tip of Baja California Sur and yachts were damaged. There was no major damage on the mainland. There was one report of of rainfall at Cabo San Lucas. Similar amounts of rain may have spread inland over mainland Mexico. The storm total of 18.50 inches/470 mm reported at San Vicente de la Sierra. Despite the rainfall, damage in Mexico was minor, with only one casualty (a San Diego vacationer) caused by a downed power line in a trailer park. Damage totaled to around $800,000 (1996 USD) in both Baja California and the mainland in Mexico. However, Fausto downed power poles, smashed windows, and disrupted the tourist business at Cabo San Lucas and La Paz.

The squad was bolstered in January 1996 with the arrival of Zac George - the City Wasps only import player. The team finished fourth in their conference and went on to play against Southern champions Wightlink Raiders in both the League and Cup finals. Despite attracting sizeable crowds for the level of ice hockey, the team was disbanded in the summer of 1996 after the announcement that their Riverside Rink was to close, ending a 56-year history of ice hockey in Durham.

Berry, 113 U.S. 322 (1885), was a case regarding a decree whereby a director of a corporation can be released by that corporation of all claims, equitable or otherwise, arising out of transactions under a contract between the corporation and the director made in excess of its corporate powers is valid, if made in good faith and without fraud or concealment.. In 1869 several individuals interested in a patent for the manufacture of illuminating gas, and gas machines known as \\"Rand's Patent,\\" for the States of Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Iowa, agreed to unite their interests, obtain an act of incorporation from the Legislature of Illinois, and do business in Chicago. They applied to the legislature of the state, and on 24 March following obtained an act duly incorporating them and their associates and successors under the name of the Illinois Pneumatic Gas Company. By its third section, the corporation was invested with power to manufacture and sell illuminating gas, to be made from petroleum or its products under the patents owned or to be owned by the company, or in which it may have any title or interest, issued or to be issued to A. C. Rand; also to manufacture and sell the works and machinery, with all needed materials and appliances for such manufacture, and to make assignments and grant licenses under the patents in the same manner and to the same effect as if the corporation were a natural person. In September 1869, the corporators organized under the act of the legislature, adopted a set of bylaws for the management of the affairs of the company, and, pursuant to them elected a board of nine directors, with full control of its property and franchises, and a president, secretary, and treasurer and general manager. The defendant Joseph H. Berry was chosen as one of the directors, and Mahlon S. Frost was chosen treasurer and general manager. From this time until the first of June in the following year, 1870, the company carried on at Chicago the business of manufacturing gas machines. But the business was not profitable, and the company ran in debt and became embarrassed. Judgments were recovered against it upon which executions were issued and levied upon its property. It was without money or credit or any available means of raising funds, and the forcible sale of its whole property was imminent. Several leases were negotiated and extended and on March 15, 1876, the defendants made a third proposition to the directors for the adjustment of their business, which was accepted and incorporated into an agreement executed on that day. It transferred to the company the interest in the lease to Frost remaining in them, and stipulated to assign and transfer on demand all of the capital stock owned by them for the sum of $274, and the right to manufacture gas machines at some one place to be selected by them in certain named state, with the privilege of selling the machines. It stipulated to pay and deliver to the stockholders the moneys received from them under the contract of October 15, 1874, with interest thereon, and to deliver up such notes as they then held. And on the other hand, the company stipulated to pay to the defendants their proportion of any royalty that might be collected on the patents during the time the defendants owned stock in the company in the proportion that their stock bore to the whole stock of the company, and it released them from all claims, either equitable or otherwise, which it had by virtue of previous agreements or transactions. The provisions of this agreement were fully carried out by the defendants. They paid over to the several stockholders the money, and surrendered the notes they had received under the agreement of October 15, 1874, and interest on the money. Notwithstanding this settlement and the release of the company thereby executed, the present bill was filed by it in September 1877, upon instructions of its board of directors to cancel the lease and contracts, to charge the defendants as trustees, and compel them to account for the property received from the company and profits made by them in their business under the lease. It set forth the lease and the transactions we have mentioned, and charges that they were made in excess of the authority of the directors, and were therefore null and void; that it was a breach of duty on their part to make the lease to Frost and on his part to receive it, he being the treasurer and general manager of the company, and also that the release was invalid because the defendants then had in their possession, unaccounted for, the sum of at least $60,000 derived from their business under the lease, which belonged to the company. The answer of the defendants explained the agreements and transactions with the company, its insolvent condition when the lease was made, the repeated offers to return the property and turn over the business to the company, and the final settlement and execution of the release of the company by the agreement of March 15, 876. The lease to Frost and the contracts and transactions between the parties were fully disclosed by the proofs produced, and the court held, after full consideration, that under the embarrassed circumstances in which the company was placed at the time, judgments being rendered against it and executions levied upon its property, which was about to be sold, the lease was a valid transaction. Had it not been made, said the court, and the money furnished by the defendants to meet the liabilities of the company, its whole property would have been sacrificed and its business entirely broken up, and though Frost, to whom the lease was made, was at the time a director of the corporation, that fact of itself was not sufficient ground to set aside the contract, it being made to protect the interests or the company, and without any fraudulent design on his part. The court also held that it ought not to set aside the lease for other reasons-- namely that it had been executed over seven years before any objection was made to it, and had during this time been repeatedly ratified, and that the release executed under the agreement of March 15, 1876, was a full and final settlement of the matters and claims between the parties, there being no evidence that the settlement was obtained by fraud or any improper conduct of either party. The court therefore dismissed the bill, and from its decree the cause is brought by appeal to this Court. A court of equity does not listen with much satisfaction to the complaints of a company that transactions were illegal which had its approval, which were essential to its protection, and the benefits of which it has fully received. Complaints that its own directors exceeded their authority come with ill grace when the acts complained of alone preserved its existence. But it is not necessary to rest our judgment of affirmance of the decree of the court below upon any consideration of the character of those transactions. After seven years' acquiescence in the lease, something more must be shown than that it was executed in excess of the powers of the directors before the lessee will be required to surrender the profits he has made under it. The lease expired June 1, 1874; the disposition of the property was settled by the agreement of March 15, 1876, and the release is an answer to all claims for the profits made by the defendants. The release is of itself sufficient to justify the dismissal of the bill. There is no evidence that it was obtained upon any fraudulent representations. Nothing was kept from the parties when it was executed. Indeed, all the transactions between the defendants and the company, from the time they took from Frost an assignment of the lease, were open and well known. There was no concealment, either had or attempted, of anything that was done, and no just reason can be given for disturbing the settlement made. The decree was affirmed.

The game is a spin-off of 2007's Skate. It was released in 2008. Overview Skate It is set between the events of Skate and Skate 2 in San Vanelona, the same fictional city as the original game, although several earthquakes have caused widespread damage and a mass evacuation of the city, leaving the player free to skate alone and undisturbed. They will, however, be able to travel to other cities in the world later in the game. Skate It is the only game in the series to not feature the main protagonist of the series, as this is set during the protagonist's incarceration explained in Skate 2. Because the Nintendo DS and Wii lack the dual analog joysticks that were used for control in the original game, the controls for Skate It were redesigned to take advantage of each platform's respective control methods. For example, the Wii version utilizes the motion sensing of the Wii Remote to control the player's skateboard, with gestures used to perform tricks, while the Nintendo DS version features stylus and touchscreen control. The Wii version also features support for the Wii Balance Board. The Wii version uses a modified version of the original's game engine, supports 480p and widescreen display options, and contains the instant Replay feature from the original game. The Wii version also offers a deep and unique career mode that allows the player to earn sponsors, unlock gear, and travel to places such as London, Barcelona, Paris, Shanghai, San Francisco and Rio de Janeiro, a first for the series. In addition, a number of offline and online multiplayer modes are available. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, where the Wii version was ported for release on February 12, 2009, Famitsu gave it a score of all four sixes for a total of 24 out of 40. IGN cited some issues with the Wii version's motion-based control scheme though they claim that for those willing to master it, the scheme reveals a great depth and a more nuanced trick system. They also praised the overall gameplay, the long and extensive single player mode, the soundtrack and presentation, but felt the in game graphics were \\"bland\\" and at times \\"nasty\\". IGN also called the DS version's gameplay \\"enormously challenging\\" and \\"amazingly satisfying due to its complexity\\", but were slightly disappointed by occasional bugs and glitches and an overall lack of polish compared to the Wii version. The Nintendo DS version was a nominee for several DS-specific awards by IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Sports Game, Best Online Multiplayer Game, and Most Innovative Design.

Description There is a toll to use the tunnel, payable in full even for drivers who already display on their vehicles a Swiss motorway sticker. The tunnel comprises a section of the E27 route linking Belfort with Aosta. For most of its length the tunnel runs in a straight line, but incorporating a gentle slope. The northern end is above sea level while the southern end is only above sea level. At both ends, the approach road to the tunnel is covered by a gallery / avalanche shelter in order to minimize the risk of access to the tunnel being temporarily blocked during bad weather. Any frontier formalities are handled at the tunnel's north end, although the actual national frontier is from the Swiss tunnel entrance and from the Italian entrance. The name of the tunnel comes directly from that of the Grand St Bernard Pass, and thereby indirectly from the saint who in AD 1049 founded the hospice high above the tunnel, that also bears his name. Tourists on the Swiss side additionally find themselves reminded by road side billboards of the saint's association with St Bernard dogs. History Before the tunnel was constructed, the frontier was passable here only using the Great St Bernard Pass. The pass remains an option in summer, but is normally closed by snow between October and May, and sometimes for longer. The tunnel is intended to be usable for 365 days every year. The tunnel was opened to traffic on 19 March 1964, having been under construction since 1958. It became the longest road tunnel in the world, replacing the Vielha tunnel which was opened in 1948. The approach roads have been progressively improved, and most recently the avalanche covers extended on the southern side. The Mont Blanc tunnel tragedy of 1999 prompted a major review of road tunnel safety in several countries including Switzerland, and significant safety upgrades are planned for the Grand St Bernard Tunnel. A speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) is already in force inside the tunnel. Access and popularity The tunnel and most of the connecting road between Aosta and Martigny are only single carriageway roads, and for most relevant city destinations in Switzerland and Italy the toll free St Gotthard Tunnel and Simplon Pass offer more direct or at least faster routes. This and the toll ensure that the Grand San Bernard Tunnel rarely suffers from the levels of holiday season congestion that plague the more popular Alpine crossing routes.

In 2007, Kagetora and Rasse beat Shu and Kei Sato for the Tohoku Tag Team Championship and during their title reign they won the Osaka Pro Wrestling Tag Team Championship, becoming dual champions. =Dragondoor and El Dorado Wrestling (2006‚Äì2007)= After Kagetora became the leader of STONED, the stable started appearing as well in Dragondoor, where they clashed with dominant stable Aagan Iisou, led by Shuji Kondo. As the promotion closed after a few events, Kagetora moved his independent ventures to Pro Wrestling Zero1, where he found himself teaming up with a member of Aagan Iisou, Takuya Sugawara, who had been recruited for STONED by Gamma. When Dragondoor was reopened as El Dorado Wrestling, Kagetora started wrestling regularly there under the modified name of KAGETORA, in all caps. Under his command, STONED started a feud against Aagan Iisou over which would recruit Sugawara, as the latter was now a simultaneous member of both factions and there were friction between all three parties. Ultimately, Sugawara chose STONED, but he and the Brahman Brothers turned on KAGETORA and expelled him, renaming the group as HELL DEMONS. Afterwards, KAGETORA allied ironically with another ex-member of Aagan Iisou, Toru Owashi, as part of the latter's Animal Planets faction. He challenged Kota Ibushi for the Independent World Junior Heavyweight Championship, but lost the match. He started teaming with Ibushi and they won the UWA World Tag Team Championship, but they later vacated the titles. =Dragon Gate (2008‚Äìpresent)= On December 19, 2008, KAGETORA debuted in Dragon Gate after it was announced that El Dorado would be closing, intruding after the opening match. He openly declared war on Dragon Gate, attacking m.c. KZ and criticizing fellow former El Dorado wrestler Naoki Tanisaki for abandoning the company months prior. He stated that he himself had abandoned Dragon Gate in 2004, but was now back to wreak havoc. However, Toryumon veteran K-ness reminded him that it was Dragon Gate who had abandoned KAGETORA and the rest of Toryumon X, not the other way around. K-ness did state that he was happy for Toryumon X wrestlers such as El Blazer and Shinjitsu Nohashi for returning, but not KAGETORA, and he dismissed him and referred to him by his dojo boy name, \\"Hashimoto-kun\\". This led to the announcement of KAGETORA first two Dragon Gate matches, against m.c.KZ and then K-ness. He then joined up with the Real Hazard stable. He fought in the one-night Battle of Tokyo Tournament on January 25, 2009, where he beat K-ness in the opening round, and then would go on to win the tournament, beating Akira Tozawa in the finals. The victory earned him an Open the Brave Gate title shot against Masato Yoshino a few weeks later, but he failed to win it. Kenichiro Arai started verbally abusing him for the loss, which continued right up until March 1. On that day, he had had enough: When YAMATO & Cyber Kong were defending their Open the Twin Gate Championship against Susumu Yokosuka & Gamma, he interfered and cost his stablemates the titles. He then left Real Hazard and joined Yokosuka, Gamma, and the returning CIMA in their WARRIORS-5 stable. On April 15, he captured his first title in Dragon Gate, winning the Open the Triangle Gate titles with CIMA & Gamma. In August, he made another attempt on the Brave Gate by participating in a tournament for the vacant title, and though he made it to the finals, he lost to Naoki Tanisaki. When Susumu Yokosuka left WARRIORS-5 for Real Hazard on December 3, he began to distance himself from the remainder of the unit over the next few weeks, and then went missing. When he went missing, a new Dr. Muscle appeared in Real Hazard. When Dragon Kid left KAMIKAZE for WARRIORS-5 on January 11, 2010, he broke his silence the next day, posting a blog where he questioned why Kid was allowed into the stable, and he hinted at crashing the January 15th show, since he had no match scheduled for that day. He didn't show up, but the day after, he revealed himself to be the one under the Dr. Muscle mask, and re-joined Real Hazard. KAGETORA, (far right) along with Akira Tozawa and Super Shisa represent Dragon Gate in the 2011 King of Trios tournament, where they faced the Osirian Portal in the quarter-finals. However, he openly stated his distrust of everyone in the stable, except for Takuya Sugawara, and he very quickly began to regret joining them. Then, on February 7, he oddly went to Akira Tozawa for advice, asking him if he made the right decision in rejoining Real Hazard, or if he should have stayed in the WARRIORS-5 stable. Tozawa simply replied that it was his path, so he had to find his own answer. Things got worse for KAGETORA three days later, when he accidentally cost Sugawara a shot at becoming the next challenger for the Open the Dream Gate Title. This set up a match for the following day between himself and stablemate Kzy (the former m.c.KZ), where the loser would be kicked out of Real Hazard. He also sought advice from Tozawa again, wondering if his upcoming trip to Germany would go wrong just like how leaving WARRIORS-5 and joining Real Hazard went wrong, but they both couldn't come up with an answer. The next day, Kzy defeated him, expelling him from Real Hazard. Yasushi Kanda and Kenichiro Arai started to attack him afterwards, but Tozawa came to his rescue. He tried to console KAGETORA, but KAGETORA told him he wanted to be alone and ran off. After the main event match concluded, CIMA called him out. He came to the ring and apologized for deserting WARRIORS-5, and then tried to get some advice from him, prompting Tozawa to come back out and attempt to assert his newfound role as KAGETORA's mentor. As a result, a match was made for February 27, with CIMA, Gamma & Dragon Kid of Warriors-5 facing Tozawa, YAMATO & Shingo Takagi of KAMIKAZE, and the winning team would get KAGETORA. During the match, KAGETORA was hit by an errant cane attack from Gamma, and took the cane away from Gamma when he attempted to cheat again. The finish of the match occurred when KAGETORA accidentally hit Gamma with his cane, leading to Tozawa pinning Gamma for KAMIKAZE's win. KAGETORA thus joined KAMIKAZE, promising his new stablemates that he would do his best. On April 15, 2011, KAGETORA represented Team Dragon Gate in the 2011 King of Trios tournament along with Akira Tozawa and Super Shisa. In the first round of the tournament, Team Dragon Gate defeated the Spectral Envoy (UltraMantis Black, Hallowicked and Frightmare). The following day, Team Dragon Gate was eliminated from the tournament in the quarter-final stage by The Osirian Portal (Amasis, Hieracon and Ophidian). On April 17, the final day of the tournament, KAGETORA and Shisa took part in a gauntlet tag match and were the final team to enter, but they were defeated by Atsushi Kotoge and Daisuke Harada. KAGETORA and Super Shisa attack Amasis. On May 13, 2011, Takagi disbanded KAMIKAZE, after which KAGETORA followed him and YAMATO to Masaaki Mochizuki's new stable, Junction Three. On December 1, KAGETORA and Susumu Yokosuka failed to capture the Open the Twin Gate Championship in a match against the Blood Warriors team of Akira Tozawa and BxB Hulk and as a result were forced to change their ring names to Jimmy KAGETORA and Jimmy Susumu, respectively. On February 9, 2012, Junction Three was forced to disband, after losing a fourteen-man elimination tag team match to Blood Warriors. On March 3, KAGETORA formed the Jimmyz stable with H-A-Gee-Mee, Jimmy Kanda, Ryo \\"Jimmy\\" Saito and Jimmy Susumu. The following day, KAGETORA and Jimmy Susumu defeated Akira Tozawa and BxB Hulk to win the Open the Twin Gate Championship. They lost the title to BxB Hulk and \\"Naoki Tanisaki\\" on June 10, but regained them on June 17 in a 3-way Elimination tag team match which also included MadoGiwa Windows members K-ness & Kenichiro Arai. They would lose the Twin Gate belts to -akatushi- members Shingo Takagi and YAMATO at the Kobe Pro-Wrestling PPV on July 22, 2012. On June 19, 2016, Kagetora and Susumu defeated T-Hawk and Big R Shimizu to capture their third Twin Gate Championship. They would lose the titles to CIMA and Dragon Kid on November 3. On March 20, 2017, Jimmy Kagetora defeated El Lindaman in the finals of a tournament to win the vacant Open the Brave Gate Championship. He made his first successful defense on May 5, 2017 at Dead Or Alive, against Takehiro Yamamura.

It was the new home of Solihull Borough following their departure from their original Widney Lane Ground. It is now the home of Solihull Moors, the club formed when Solihull Borough and Moor Green merged in 2007. They previously shared Damson Park with Birmingham & Solihull R.F.C. (who moved to Portway in 2012) and also used to have an agreement that allows Birmingham City Reserves the use of the ground for their reserve games. The capacity of the stadium is 5,500.https://www.footballgroundguide.com/leagues/conference/conference- premier/solihull-moors-damson-park.html It was revealed on 23 July 2013 that for the following three seasons the ground would be known as the \\"Autotech Stadium\\" for sponsorship reasons.. Birmingham City W.F.C. of the FA WSL have used Damson Park for home games since 2014. The ground has two seated stands on either side of the pitch, and a covered stand of mixed seating and terracing at the southeastern end of the ground, where all six entrances are located. The main stand lies on the southwestern side of the ground and is connected to the clubhouse. The clubhouse contains three separate bar areas, and is also home to a pie & chips shop on matchdays. The stand has seating at the bottom and a balcony above reserved for sponsors and club officials. Adjacent to the main stand is an area of hard standing with a raised toilet block. The steps leading to the entrances to the toilet facilities provide the only small area of terracing at that end of the ground, and are thus popular with a group of Solihull Moors fans calling themselves \\"The Number 2 Crew\\" when their side is attacking that end of the pitch. Turnstiles open into the area next to the main stand (which also hosts the club shop and a hot food concession), the hard standing area on the opposite side of the pitch from the main stand, and into the other large stand. This area, known as 'The Shed' - or sometimes also 'The Tuck Shop End' to supporters, is currently officially titled as 'The TC Cars Stand' for sponsorship reasons. As its name suggests, it is home to the club tuck shop which sells refreshments throughout the match, but not hot food. Much of the rest of the ground is undeveloped hard standing. Nearest to the turnstiles on the northeast side of the ground, there is a toilet block and sometimes a second hot food stall, depending on segregation requirements and demand. Opposite the main stand there is a single step of terracing that straddles the halfway line of the pitch. Further along this side, in the opposite direction from the T&C; Cars Stand, is a smaller area of covered seating that was erected in 2016. The furthest end of the ground from the turnstiles is a terrace with a roof, and runs the whole back end of the pitch. This is used for away fans with large followings, otherwise open to everyone. This stand was brought over from Maidstone United's Gallagher Stadium in 2016‚Äì17. The stadium played host to the Midland Football League Cup final on 10 May 2016, a 3‚Äì1 win for Hereford over Walsall Wood.http://bullsnews.blogspot.co.uk/2016/05/third-trophy-for-hereford.html The stadium seats 770 across the three different seated areas of the ground. Overall capacity is 3,050. The record attendance is 3,681 v Leyton Orient on 22 April 2019 in the 2018‚Äì19 National League. There are plans underway to increase the overall capacity by developing all sides of the ground, in line with requirements for the National League.

He goes to Senegal's capital city, Dakar, to try to earn more money and is exploited there. He returns to the villagers and shares his experiences of the city with the other men.

La Ricerca Folklorica (18): 25-40. (subtitled: A sud dell'occidente. Viaggi, missioni e colonie della vecchia Italia). (in Italian) Biography The son of a Florentine banker, he first made his name in the Italian scientific community at the age of 20, when he explored a cave near Genoa, discovering Neolithic remains of exceptional value. He thus was introduced to eminent scientists and explorers such as Odoardo Beccari (who had explored Malaysia and Sumatra in 1872), Giacomo Doria, and Arturo Issael. Modigliani was also a disciple of Cesare Lombroso, an eminent anthropologist, criminologist and jurist, who was the Italian herald of physiognomy. =Travels to the Indonesian archipelago= Siduho Gheo, chief of Hili Dgiono, 1886 Between 1886 and 1894, Modigliani explored Sumatra and a number of islands off its western coast.van Steenis-Kruseman MJ, et al. (2006). Cyclopaedia of Malesian Collectors: Elio Modigliani. Nationaal Herbarium Nederland. His first trip, in 1886, was to the island of Nias, of which he explored the southern region (Nias Salatan), travelling among head-hunting tribes. He came back unscathed, and wrote his first book, Un viaggio a Nias. Nias Salatan at the time was forbidden territory for all foreigners, and Dutch military and naval expeditions had failed time and again to impose colonial rule in this region, populated by redoutable head hunters.Kolonial Verslag van 1842. (in Dutch). Moreover, the head hunters' villages were at war with each other at the time of his visit, and Modigliani was travelling with the sole company of four Javanese tracker hunters, i.e., virtually undefended; and he personally clashed with high-ranking members of Nias society, including the redoutable Siwa Sahilu, who commanded some 2,000 warriors out of his village of Hili Simaetano. Yet, Elio Modigliani managed to save his own head and that of his men, and bring back a formidable collection of Nias artefacts for the Ethnographic Museum of Florence, where they are presently on display.Modigliani E (1890). Un viaggio a Nias. Milan: Fratelli Treves Editori. (in Italian). During his exploration, Modigliani was faced on several occasions with highly dangerous situations, and yet he never had to fire a shot nor even to level his weapons against a warrior. He managed to resolve any conflict through a mixture of psychological warfare and empathy. Likewise, his main opponent, Chief Siwa Sahilu, was a subtle strategist and his equal at this game. Their dueling was reconstructed through the research of Vanni Puccioni, who in 2010 collected the memories of the warriors' descendants in Nias Salatan.Puccioni, Vanni (2013). Tra i Tagliatori di Teste: Elio Modigliani, un fiorentino all'esplorazione di Nias Salatan, 1886. Venice: Marsilio Editori. (in Italian). Modigliani visited Enggano Island between April 25 and July 13, 1891. He detailed the apparently dominant role of women in Enggano culture in L'Isola delle Donne (The Island of Women), first published in 1894.Modigliani E (1894). L'Isola delle Donne.

History The winery was founded in San Francisco, California in 1876 by two Italian brothers, Giuseppe and Pietro Simi, who had immigrated to the United States during the California Gold Rush. They moved operations to Healdsburg, California in 1881, paying $2,250 in gold coins to buy a winery on Front Street. Isabelle Simi The winery was run by Giuseppe Simi's daughter, Isabelle Simi, beginning 1904. After marrying a local banker, Isabelle continued to make wine during Prohibition from 1920 until 1933, which she stored in the winery's stone cellars. One of the few California wineries to survive Prohibition, Simi was forced to sell most of its vineyards to survive, but was also one of the few companies to have wine available when sales were again legal. Simi opened its first tasting room in 1934. Isabel Simi sold the winery to grower Russell Green in 1970 but continued working there. In 1973 Maryann Graf, the first woman to graduate from an American university with a degree in oenology, joined Simi. In 1979 winemaking was taken over by Zelma Long, one of California's most prominent winemakers, who modernized and brought the winery to national prominence.

In March 2018, marketing authorisations for flupirtine were withdrawn following a European Medicines Agency recommendation based on the finding that the restrictions introduced in 2013 had not been sufficiently followed in clinical practice, and cases of serious liver injury still occurred including liver failure. Flupirtine is a selective neuronal potassium channel opener (SNEPCO) that also has NMDA receptor antagonist and GABAA receptor modulatory properties. It first became available in Europe in 1984 under the brand name Katadolon and after it went off patent many generic brands were introduced. Uses Flupirtine is used as an analgesic for acute pain, in moderate-to-severe cases. Its muscle relaxant properties make it popular for back pain and other orthopaedic uses, but it is also used for migraines, in oncology, postoperative care, and gynaecology. In 2013 due to issues with liver toxicity, the European Medicines Agency restricted its use to acute pain, for no more than two weeks, and only for people who cannot use other painkillers. Side effects The most serious side effect is frequent hepatotoxicity which prompted regulatory agencies to issue several warnings and restrictions.EMA information about flupirtinearticle in Deutsches √Ñrzteblatt Flupirtine is devoid of negative psychological or motor function effects, or effects on reproductive function. Abuse and dependence Although some studies have reported flupirtine has no addictive properties, there was suggestion that it may possess some abuse potential and liability. There were at least two registered cases of flupirtine abuse. Drug tolerance does not develop in most cases, but has individually occurred. Mechanism of action Flupirtine is a selective neuronal potassium channel opener that also has indirect NMDA receptor antagonist and GABAA receptor modulatory properties. History Flupirtine was discovered and developed between the 1970s and the 1990s by Chemiewerk Homburg in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, which became Degussa Pharma Group and then through mergers, ASTA Pharma and Asta Medica. Retigabine, in which the pyridine group in flupirtine is replaced with a phenyl group, was discovered as part of the same program and has a similar mechanism of action. It was approved for the treatment of pain in 1984 in Europe under the brand name Katadolon. As of 2013 it was used in 11 member countries: Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Romania and Slovak Republic. Many generics entered the European market around 2011. It was never introduced to the United States market for any indication but in 2008, Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now called Synthetic Biologics, Inc.) obtained an option to license issued and patent pending applications relating to flupirtine's use in the treatment of ophthalmic indications, particularly retinitis pigmentosa. In 2010 retigabine was approved by the FDA as an anticonvulsant for the treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures in treatment-experienced patients. As of 2016 it is marketed under many brand names, including Efiret, Flupigil, Flupirtin, Flupirtina, Flupirtine, Flupizen, Fluproxy, Katadolon, Metanor, Trancolong, and Zentiva.Flupirtine Drugs.com.

Canadian origin This urban myth has its origins in a 2004 Toronto Star article. On March 11, 2004, the Toronto Star published an article about the resettlement of a group of refugees from Somalia to Hamilton, Ontario. The article focused on the Canadian government's new strategy to divert immigrant and refugee settlement away from the most popular destinations of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver. The article also described the support that the Somali refugees would receive from the Government of Canada: > A single person receives $1,890 from the federal government as start-up > allowance, along with $580 monthly social assistance, depending on how soon > the person is able to find employment. They also each receive a night lamp, > table, a chair and a single bed from the government.Keung, N. (2004, Mar > 11). New refugee plan eyes small cities: Newcomers settle with old friends. > Toronto Star. On March 12, the day following the publication of the article, Nicholas Keung, the reporter who wrote the original article, received a \\"polemic\\" e-mail from a reader.Sellar, D. (2004, Nov 27). Can we dispel this urban myth? Toronto Star, p. H.06. The author of the e-mail mistakenly concluded that refugees receive a monthly allowance from the federal government greater than the monthly allowance received by pensioners. This e-mail was also copied to 100 other recipients. When the reporter tried to respond to the e-mail to correct the mistake, he found that the address no longer existed.Sellar, D. (2004, Nov 27). Can we dispel this urban myth? Toronto Star, p. H.06. On the same day, a letter to the editor appeared in the Toronto Star in response to Keung's article. The letter stated: > I think the effort to resettle refugees in smaller communities is an > excellent effort. These refugees may find it easier to integrate into a > smaller community especially if accompanied by some of their compatriots. I > also find it interesting that the federal government provides a single > refugee with a monthly allowance of $1,890 and each can also get an > additional $580 in social assistance for a total of $2,470. This compares > very well to a single pensioner who after contributing to the growth and > development of Canada for 40 years can only receive a monthly maximum of > $1,012 in old age pension and Guaranteed Income Supplement. Maybe our > pensioners should apply as refugees?Pay pensioners same as refugees? (2004, > Mar 12). Toronto Star. The Toronto Star published this letter without checking the facts or the original article for clarification. Following the publication of the letter to the editor and the distribution of the forwarded e-mail, the Toronto Star was bombarded with e-mails from readers who felt that something should be done to ensure that pensioners received their fair due by the government. After investigating the matter and realizing that a mistake had been made, the ombudsman of the paper published an article on November 27, 2004, correcting the conclusion that refugees received more than pensioners. \\"In hindsight, the ombud now wishes he'd issued a speedy clarification to help set the record straight\\", he wrote. \\"But with information (and misinformation) moving at a warp speed on the Internet, I doubt there was a silver bullet for the problem\\". This apology and correction of the mistake had little impact on the circulation of the newly born urban myth. The same letter to the editor appeared with minor alterations in over 50 newspapers, online newsletters, blogs, and discussion forums in the next three years. Six newspapers printed the same letter with slight alterations more than once on different dates and from different authors.The Alberni Valley Times printed the letter on Jan 13, 2006, and Jun 28, 2006. The Barrie Advance, Midland-Penetanguishine Mirror, and Orillia Today published the letter first on Feb 11, 2005, and again on Jul 7, 2006. The facts of the letter were corrected by another reader whose letter was published by all three newspapers on Jul 14, 2006. The Welland Tribute published the letter on Jan 28, 2005, and again on Aug 12, 2006. A local member of parliament corrected the facts in a letter which was published on Aug 18, 2006. The letter was published three times by the Windsor Star: on Mar 20, 2004; Mar 24, 2006; and on Aug 18, 2006. Ultimately; Citizenship and Immigration Canada published an online fact sheet on the issue in November 2006 to try to counter the spread of the false information.Citizenship and Immigration Canada. (2006, Nov 22, 2006). Just the facts: financial assistance for refugees from Canadian government response See http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=105&t;=11 In 2006, Citizenship and Immigration Canada dismissed this rumour stating: > Refugees don't receive more financial assistance from the federal government > than Canadian pensioners. A letter to the editor of a Canadian newspaper > contained this incorrect information. In it, a one-time, start-up payment > provided to some refugees in Canada was mistaken for an ongoing, monthly > payment. Unfortunately, although the newspaper published a clarification, > the misleading information had already spread widely over e-mail and the > internet.See http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/media/facts/aid.asp Appearance in US media The letter has continued to appear on the Internet and the original email has been altered in some cases, replacing the Canadian context with an American one.See http://www.snopes.com/politics/immigration/refugees.asp Many conservative politicians and commentators, however, have embraced this urban legend in a general sense. Appearance in Australian media In 2008, the ABC program Media Watch documented several appearances of the urban legend in Australia's mainstream media, beginning with The Cairns Post which published letters to the editor containing the claims, and using the same figures as the original Canadian email, in August 2007 and February 2008.Viral emails in Queensland 1, Media Watch (ABC1), 17 March 2008. Despite the Media Watch story, the same letters appeared two months later in The Courier-Mail in Brisbane and The West Australian in Perth.Does no-one listen to Media Watch?, Media Watch (ABC1), 14 April 2008. On April 21, 2008, 2GB talkback radio host Alan Jones read the email on air, and was critical of Media Watch when the program contacted him to advise him of the hoax.Viral Overload, Media Watch (ABC1), 28 April 2008. The Australian government's Department of Immigration and Citizenship responded to a letter in the Sunraysia Daily, drawing attention to the email's Canadian origins, and stating that benefits paid to refugees were on the same basis and at the same rate as those to any Australian resident.Logan, Sandi: Refugees not paid more than pensioners - hoax email, Department of Immigration and Citizenship (Australia), 21 February 2008.

Through this process, the decision to enter into transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities are able to take control of health program responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities.  Background  To put Health Transfer in context, it is useful to understand from a historical perspective how First Nations, Inuit, M√©tis and the Federal Government through Indian and Northern Affairs have worked together to respond to Aboriginal peoples expressed desire to manage and control their own health programs. = 1969 White Paper = Federal Government Policy Paper which proposed to remove the status of treaty individuals under the Indian Act and to discontinue special services so identified, advocating the increased assimilation of Indigenous people into the culture of Canada. =1970 Red Paper= Aboriginal response to the White Paper emphasizing federal responsibility for health care to First Nation peoples and emphasizing plans to strengthen community control of their lives and of government-delivered community programs. =1975 Indian Relationships Paper= The White and Red Papers served as an impetus for the collaborative effort of the Federal Government and Aboriginal to begin serious planning for the future.Castile, George Pierre Taking Charge: Native American Self- Determination and Federal Indian Policy, 1975-1993 Tucson: The University of Arizona Press 168p, Publication Date: September 2006 This resulted in the 1975 paper, The Canadian Government/The Canadian Indian Relationships, which defined a policy framework for strengthening Indian control of programs and services. In the health sector, under contribution agreements 75% of the Bands became responsible for such programs as the Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program and the Community Health Representative Program. =1979 Indian Health Policy= The stated goal of the Indian Health Policy adopted by the Federal Government on September 19, 1979, is \\"to achieve an increasing level of health in Indian communities, generated and maintained by the Indian communities themselves\\". In this regard, the policy emphasized the historic responsibilities of both federal and provincial governments to provide health services to First Nations and Inuit people. It removed the issue of treaty rights from health policy considerations. The policy reasoned that improvements to the health status of the Indian population should be built on three pillars: (1) community development, both socio-economic and cultural/spiritual, to remove the conditions which limit the attainment of well-being; (2) the traditional trust relationship between Indian people and the federal government; and (3) the interrelated Canadian health system, with its federal, provincial, municipal, Indian and private sectors. A further important aspect of the new policy was the recognition that First Nation and Inuit communities could take over any or all aspect(s) of the administration of their own community health programs, at their discretion and with the support of the Department of National Health and Welfare.Hogg, P. and M.E. Turpel. \\"Implementing Aboriginal Self-Government: Constitutional and Jurisdictional Issues.\\" The Canadian Bar Review. Vol. 74, No. 2, June 1995, p. 187-2 =1980 (Berger Report)= The report of the Advisory Committee on Indian and Inuit Health Consultation known as the \\"Berger Report\\". Recommended methods of consultation that would ensure substantive participation by First Nations and Inuit people in the design, management and control of health care services in their communities. = 1983 (Penner Report) = The Report of the Special Committee on Indian Self-Government knows as the \\"Penner Report\\" recommended that the Federal government establish a new relationship with First Nations and Inuit people and that an essential element of this relationship be recognition of Indian Self-Government. The report identified health as a key area for takeover. = 1983‚Äì1986 Community Health Projects = First Nations and Inuit Health Branch sponsored demonstration projects for First Nations. The experiment was initiated to provide both Federal and First Nation authorities with the same substantive information with respect to First Nation control of health services. = 1986 Sechelt Band Self-Government Act = The Sechelt Indian Band Self-Government Act was passed by Parliament in 1986. In April of the following year, the British Columbia Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a bill to give the Sechelt community municipal status. Consequently, the Sechelt Indian Band signed the first Self-Government agreement in which a First Nation community assumed control of their health services. = 1988 Health Transfer south of the 60th parallel = In order for First Nations and Inuit Health Branch to proceed with health transfer to First Nations as part of administrative reform, the policy framework, authorities and resources had to be developed and secured. A Subcommittee on the Transfer of Health Programs to Indian Control was established with representation from First Nations with experience in health care. The Subcommittee incorporated the experiences from the Community Health Projects and recommended a developmental and consultative approach for health transfer. These recommendations were then used to finalize the health transfer policy framework.Cameron, K. and G. White. Northern Governments in Transition: Political and Constitutional Developments in the Yukon, Nunavut and the Western Northwest Territories. The Institute for Research on Public Policy, Montreal, 1995. On March 16, 1988, the Federal Government Cabinet approved the health transfer policy framework for transferring resources for Indian health programs south of the 60th parallel to Indian control through a process which: * permits health program control to be assumed at a pace determined by the community, i.e., the community can assume control gradually over a number of years through a phased transfer; * enables communities to design health programs to meet their needs; * requires that certain mandatory public health and treatment programs be provided; * strengthens the accountability of Chiefs and Councils to community members; * gives communities: ** the financial flexibility to allocate funds according to community health priorities and to retain unspent balances; ** the responsibility for eliminating deficits and for annual financial audits and evaluations at specific intervals; ** permits multi-year (three to five year) agreements; ** does not prejudice treaty or Aboriginal rights; ** operates within current legislation; * is optional and open to all First Nation communities south of the 60th parallel. = 1989 Treasury Board Authorities for Transfer = In 1989, Treasury Board approved the financial authorities and resources to support pre-transfer planning and to fund community health management structures.Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Aboriginal Self-Government: Legal and Constitutional Issues. Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples, Ottawa, 1999  Process  The process is designed to occur within the present funding base of federal health programs for First Nations, Inuit and M√©tis peoples. Communities are required to provide certain mandatory programs such as communicable disease control, environmental and occupational health and safety programs, and treatment services. Initially, the enthusiasm for this process was varied. For some, it was seen as an important link to Self-Government where the community plans and controls health programs in their communities according to its own priorities. It was seen as a way to develop programs relevant to a community's own cultural and social needs. Others took a more hesitant approach. As the uptake of control of health services by First Nations increased, the Indian Health Transfer Policy began to be seen increasingly by First Nations people as a stepping stone towards the inherent right of Self-Government. Transfer became the cornerstone of Health Canada's relationship with First Nations and Inuit communities. Health Services Transfer Agreements between Health Canada and First Nation and Inuit provided the opportunity for communities or First Nations and Inuit organizations to manage their own health programs and services. At first, Transfer was the only option communities had for increasing their control over health programs and services beyond Contribution Agreements. Although many communities were interested in assuming increased control over health services and programs, not all communities were ready to move into this level of control so quickly. It became increasingly apparent that one design could not fit all the diversity of readiness. Some communities expressed interest in alternative strategies which would also give them increased control of resources. Each year brought pressures for change and restructure in the transfer approach. First Nations and Inuit Health Branch searched for ways to respond to communities desiring to increase their control of community resources, either through the transfer process, or through other initiatives. This movement was further supported by a decision of the Departmental Executive Committee of Health Canada on March 15, 1994, which directed First Nations and Inuit Health Branch to commence planning all activities toward the following goals: * the devolution of all existing First Nations and Inuit Health Branch Indian health resources to First Nations and Inuit control within a time frame to be determined during consultations with First Nations and Inuit communities; * moving First Nations and Inuit Health Branch out of the health care service delivery business; * the transfer of knowledge and capacity to First Nation and Inuit communities so that they can manage and administer their health resources; * a refocused role for First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; and a refocused role for Health Canada which will take into account First Nations and Inuit Health Branch's strategic direction. In further support the search for alternative pathways to transfer, in late 1994, Treasury Board approved the Integrated Community-Based Health Services Approach as a second transfer option for communities to move into a limited level of control over health services.Canada, Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development. Federal Policy Guide, Aboriginal Self- Government: The Government of Canada‚Äôs Approach to the Implementation of the Inherent Right and the Negotiation of Aboriginal Self-Government. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ottawa, 199 1995 saw the distribution and implementation of Pathways to First Nations Control Report of Project 07 Strategic Planning Exercise. This cornerstone document set the essential differences between The Integrated Approach and Transfer. The Integrated Approach is an intermediate measure which provides more flexibility than Contribution Agreements, but less flexibility than the Transfer Agreement.Canada. House of Commons Special Committee on Indian Self- Government. Second Report: Indian Self-Government in Canada. 1st Session, 32nd Parliament, Issue No. 40. In 1995, the federal government announced the inherent Right to Self-Government Policy. This policy recognizes First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The policy thus introduced a third option for communities to further increase their control of health services.Hamilton, A.C. A New Partnership: Report of the Honourable A.C. Hamilton, Fact Finder. Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, Ottawa, 1995. Self-governance gives Bands more flexibility to establish program priorities in response to tribal needs rather than following Federal program objectives. Bands are able to expand, consolidate and create new programs to improve services to their communities and to make certain laws governing their community with respect to health. Furthermore, the range of resources for health programs which can be included in a Self-Government arrangement is greater than those included in a Health Service Transfer arrangement and may eventually include fixed assets and services under the Non-Insured Health Benefits Program.Green, Joyce. \\"Constitutionalising the Patriarchy: Aboriginal Women and Aboriginal Government.\\" 4 Constitutional Forum 110, Summer 1993. The flexibility in terms of how resources are allocated is also greater and reporting requirements are fewer.Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, 1999-2000 Estimates, Part III ‚Äì Report on Plans and Priorities, p. 11 First Nations and Inuit peoples will determine the pace at which Self-Government arrangements proceed. Putting the arrangements in place will of course take time. The process will require intense local or regional negotiations between First Nations and Inuit peoples, the federal government and the provincial or territorial government concerned. Figure 3 depicts the status of First Nations and Inuit control activities at the close of the first decade of transfer, March 31, 1999. The uptake of transfer has steadily increased over the past decade the maps on figure 3 present a progressive overview of the rate of uptake of transfer by First Nation and Inuit communities starting in year one.

Fourteen languages are currently offered: Dutch, Danish, English, French, German, Indonesian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Russian, Swedish, Spanish and Turkish.  History  Babbel is operated by Lesson Nine GmbH in Berlin, Germany. Babbel has around 450 full- time employees and freelancers. The company is based in the Berlin neighborhood of Mitte. The company was founded in August 2007 by Markus Witte and Thomas Holl. In January 2008, the language learning platform went online with community features as a free beta version. In 2008, Kizoo Technology Ventures and IBB Beteiligungsgesellschaft mbH became Babbel's first investors. Then, in 2009, Babbel was granted roughly one million euros by the ERDF European Structural Fund. The new product version, Babbel 2.0, went online in November 2009. At that time Babbel's founders decided against an advertising and mixed-finance model (freemium), opting for paid content. In March 2013, Babbel acquired San Francisco startup PlaySay Inc. to expand into the United States. As part of the acquisition, PlaySay Founder and CEO Ryan Meinzer joined Babbel as a strategic advisor for its US operations. In January 2015, Babbel opened an office in New York City with the aim of expanding its presence in the US market. Later that year, a third funding round led by Scottish Equity Partners raised another $22 million. Other participants in this round include previous investors Reed Elsevier Ventures, Nokia Growth Partners, and VC Fonds Technology Berlin. Since January 2017, Babbel, Inc., the company's US subsidiary, has been led by Julie Hansen, CEO U.S. In November 2018 the company announced it had sold around 1 million subscriptions during the previous year. It was also launching a new set of products, oriented at travel marketplace. The project was going to launch in 2019. In 2019, co-founder Markus Witte steps down as CEO and is replaced by Arne Schepker.  Concept  Babbel is a premium, subscription-based language learning app for web, iOS and Android. Babbel currently offers 14 different languages from seven display languages (German, English (US + UK), French, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Italian and Swedish). Babbel's original learning content is developed in-house by a team of over 100 educators and linguists. There are beginner, intermediate and grammar courses, vocabulary lessons, as well as courses with tongue-twisters, idioms, colloquialisms, and sayings. Courses for a given language may be aimed at a specific audience: for instance, English may be learned as \\"PR English\\" or \\"Marketing English.\\" In August 2017, Babbel announced that it had partnered with Cambridge English Language Assessment to create a low-cost online English test.https://thepienews.com/news/cambridge-english-babbel-lowcost- test/https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/babbel-teams-up-with-cambridge-english- to-launch-new-language-test/ The test assesses beginning and intermediate students' reading and listening skills (up to level B1 and above of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Every test features about 70 questions from a bank of hundreds of options which‚Äîlike Babbel's lesson content‚Äîreflect real-life communicative situations,https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/babbel-teams-up-with-cambridge- english-to-launch-new-language-test/ including recordings of radio broadcasts and conversations for listening tasks. Juliet Wilson, director of assessment at Cambridge English, explained to Professionals in International Education News that ‚Äú...until now it‚Äôs been difficult for [online learners] to know whether they are really learning the right skills, or to demonstrate their real level,‚Äù going on to say that the Babbel English Test would ‚Äúgive learners reliable evidence of their progress and a certificate of achievement that demonstrates what they have learned.‚Äù https://thepienews.com/news/simplified- english-language-test-global-acclaim/  Corporate branding and campaigns  = Branding = The word Babbel is the imperative mood of ', which means to chat in the Hessian dialect of or Dutch. It is also a pun on the biblical Tower of Babel‚Äîa gigantic ziggurat whose construction was interrupted when the worker' languages were made mutually unintelligible by God. The same motif was used in naming the Babel fish from Douglas Adams's Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a symbiotic fish that serves as a universal translator. Babbel is also a homophone of the English verb \\"babble.\\" = Campaigns = Babbel's content marketing arm publishes a digital magazine with written and video content in seven different languages. The topics range from behind-the-scenes looks at how Babbel lessons are created to profiles of Babbel customers and language learning tips from the company's didactics team. In November 2016, Babbel launched a television ad campaign in the UK and Europe. Two television spots were created by the advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy. Sophie Bodoh, Creative Director at Wieden+Kennedy commented, \\"Everyone has different motivations for learning a language, but we recognised one common truth that applies to every new learner: They have some kind of fantasy about what it will be like to speak a new language confidently. Using the familiar cinematic worlds of different countries, we show Babbel customers playing out their own unique language-speaking fantasies.\\"  Reception  PC Magazine gave Babbel a mostly positive review, stating it was reasonably priced and well-structured, but more challenging for beginners than similar services. = Awards = The language learning platform was one of the finalists for \\"Best Web Application or Service (EMEA)\\" in TechCrunch's Europe Awards 2009. In 2011, Babbel was awarded the \\"Comenius EduMedia Seal\\" and the \\"Erasmus EuroMedia Seal of Approval\\" for \\"Babbel for Companies‚Äú courses targeted at the business sector. In 2013, Babbel received the \\"digita 2013\\" award and the \\"Innovate 4 Society\\" award at CeBIT. In 2016, Fast Company recognized Babbel as the most innovative company in education.

It is nicknamed the \\"perennial giant killer,\\" a nickname that it acquired during Pete Carril's coaching career from 1967‚Äì1996. Its most notable upset was the 1996 defeat of defending NCAA champion UCLA in the tournament's opening round, Carril's final collegiate victory. In 1989, the team almost became the only #16 seed to win, losing to Georgetown 50‚Äì49, after leading 29‚Äì21 at the half. During that 29-year span, Pete Carril won thirteen Ivy League championships and received eleven NCAA berths and two NIT bids. Princeton placed third in the 1965 NCAA Tournament and won the NIT championship in 1975. The deliberate \\"Princeton offense\\" is a legacy of his coaching career. It is employed by a number of other collegiate basketball teams. From 1992‚Äì2001, a nine-year span, the men's basketball team entered the NCAA tournament four times. Notably, the Ivy League has never had an at-large entry in the NCAA tournament. For the last half-century, Princeton and the University of Pennsylvania have traditionally battled for men's basketball dominance in the Ivy League; Princeton had its first losing season in 50 years of Ivy League basketball in 2005. Princeton tied the record for fewest points in a Division I game since the 3-point line started in 1986‚Äì87 when they scored 21 points in a loss against Monmouth University on December 14, 2005. The 1924‚Äì25 team was retroactively named the national champion by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Women's basketball Princeton's varsity women's basketball program is the strongest in the Ivy League, carrying on the tradition of the men's championship basketball program. At no time was the women's team better than it was in 2015, with a 31‚Äì0 record, a national NCAA Division 1 ranking among the top 25 teams, and entering the field of 32 teams remaining in the 2015 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament. Courtney Banghart, a Dartmouth graduate, is entering her tenth season as the Tigers' highly esteemed head coach.Princeton Alumni Weekly PAW January 2015, New York Times, January 2015 =Fencing= Men's =NCAA championships= Soren Thompson fenced for Princeton University under Ma√Ætre Michel Sebastiani,https://www.fencinginstruction.com/instructors.html Thompson was the 2001 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) √âp√©e Champion, 2nd in 2002, and 3rd in 2005.https://www.fencinginstruction.com/news.html His other NCAA awards include First Team All-American in 2001‚Äì02 and 2005, and Honorary All-American in 2003, First Team All-Ivy in 2001‚Äì03 and 2005, and Academic All-Ivy in 2005. In 2005, Princeton awarded him the William Winston Roper Trophy, its highest honor for a male athlete. Women's =Football= Princeton vs. Lehigh, September 2007 The football team has competed since 1869 and played in the first game against Rutgers University. They have won 24 national championships when the school competed in what is now known as the FBS.http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/national_championships/mel_smith/football_style.php Twenty-one former players have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The first football game played between teams representing American colleges was an unfamiliar ancestor of today's college football because it was played under soccer-style London Football Association rules. The game, between Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) and the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), took place on November 6, 1869, at College Field (now the site of the College Avenue Gymnasium at Rutgers University) in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Rutgers won by a score of six \\"runs\\" to Princeton's four. The 1869 game between Rutgers and Princeton is notable because it is the first documented game of any sport called \\"football\\" between two American colleges. It is also noteworthy because it occurred two years before a codified rugby game would be played in England. The Princeton/Rutgers game was significantly different from American rules football today but, nonetheless, it was the first inter-collegiate football contest in the United States. Another similar game took place between Rutgers and Columbia University in 1870 and a third notable game took place between Tufts University and Harvard University in 1875. The popularity of intercollegiate competition in football would spread throughout the country shortly thereafter. Though Princeton is no longer a part of Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, the Tigers have the most overall national championships of any team in major college football history with 24 consensus and non-consensus national championships dating all the way back to their first one, shared with Rutgers, in 1869. Princeton's football helmets are also the basis for Michigan Wolverines football team's famed winged helmets, as introduced by Fritz Crisler, the coach at Princeton before he was hired as the coach of the University of Michigan. Sprint In addition to the varsity Tigers, Princeton, like a number of other Ivy League schools, also fielded a sprint football squad for players 172 pounds and lighter from 1934 to 2015. The lightweight Tigers won at least a share of the league title eight times, five of those being from between 1937 and 1942. Their last championship, split with the Army Cadets, came in 1989. The Tigers sprint squad collapsed in 1999, which began a losing streak that spanned parts of 17 seasons and 106 games (a collegiate football record), including at least four forfeits; by the end of the 2015 season, Princeton's athletics department determined that the addition of several schools whose sole football team was a sprint squad (and thus were teams that could get all of the best players at their respective schools) and the loss of most of the Ivy League schools, along with the inability of Princeton to recruit more and better players for the team without compromising its other athletic programs or its academic standards, meant that the team would likely be hopelessly outmatched and that this would pose a safety hazard for the players they could recruit. This conclusion led Princeton to drop sprint football in April 2016. =Golf= Men's golf The men's golf team have won 12 national championships: 1914, 1916, 1919, 1920, 1922, 1923, 1927, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1937, and 1940 (tied with LSU). They have had seven NCAA individual champions: Louis Bayard, Jr. (1987), Percy Pyne (1899), Frank Reinhart (1903), Albert Seckel (1909), Simpson Dean (1921) and George Dunlap (1930 and 1931). They have won the Ivy League title 30 times: 1928, 1930, 1938, 1939, 1947, 1961, 1969, 1972, 1973, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1986, 1987, 1989, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2013, 2019. Women's golf The women's golf team was founded as a club sport in 1978, coached by Betty Whelan. A group called \\"Friends of Women's Golf\\" began fundraising immediately, and the group began lobbying for inclusion as a varsity sport. After ten years of being denied varsity status by the university, representatives from the team contacted the ACLU asking for assistance and raising the possibility of a lawsuit under the protections of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act. In 1991, the university committed to supporting a varsity women's golf program. After becoming a varsity team, women's golf too the Northeast championships in 1995, and Mary Moan won the first Ivy League individual championship in 1997. The team won its first Ivy League title in 1999. =Ice hockey= Men's ice hockey Women's ice hockey =Lacrosse= Men's lacrosse The university's men's lacrosse team has enjoyed significant success since the early 1990s and is widely recognized as a perennial powerhouse in the Division I ranks. The team has won thirteen Ivy League titles (1992, 1993, 1995‚Äì2004, 2006) and six national titles (1992, 1994, 1996‚Äì1998, 2001).Welcome to the World of Princeton Lacrosse Women's lacrosse The Princeton Tigers women's lacrosse team has enjoyed much success, winning 3 NCAA championships, tied for 3rd place with Virginia in the number of NCAA championships won.

A Princeton Companion. Princeton University Press. The construction of Lake Carnegie in 1906 enabled the sport to expand and laid the foundation for today's rowing program at Princeton. More recently, an $8 million upgrade and expansion of the existing boathouse in 2000 formed Shea Rowing Center, one of the finest rowing facilities in the country. With 150 athletes, 60 rowing shells, and 12 coaches, trainers, and boat riggers, crew is the largest varsity sport at Princeton, and one of the most successful. In recent years, from 2000 through 2010, Princeton varsity crews (both men's and women's) won a total of 14 Eastern Sprints, IRA (national), and NCAA championships, as well as two international events at Henley Royal Regatta. The Princeton boathouse is often a summer base for U.S. national teams in training, and many Princeton rowers and coaches have gone on to compete at the World Rowing Championships and the Olympics.

It is caused by the accumulation of lipopigments in the body due to a deficiency in tripeptidyl peptidase I as a result of a mutation in the TPP1 gene. Symptoms appear between ages 2 and 4 and consist of typical neurodegenerative complications: loss of muscle function (ataxia), drug resistant seizures (epilepsy), apraxia, development of muscle twitches (myoclonus), and vision impairment. This late-infantile form of the disease progresses rapidly once symptoms are onset and ends in death between age 8 and teens. The prevalence of Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease is unknown, however NCL collectively affects an estimated 1 in 100,000 individuals worldwide. Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease is related to late-infantile Batten disease and LINCL, and is under the umbrella of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis. Signs and symptoms Pathology The majority of cases are a result of mutations in the TPP1 gene, however mutations in the CLN5, CLN6, CLN8, MFSD8, and PPT1 genes also account for a small number of cases. These mutations result in reduced activity of peptidase enzymes, particularly affecting lysosomes, but other mutations can affect protein catabolism in white blood cells, fibroblasts, and chorionic villi. The reduced function of these enzymes results in insufficient or incomplete breakdown of proteins, consequently resulting in the buildup of lipopigments in the lysosome. Though the accumulation of lipopigments occurs throughout the body, neurons are especially vulnerable to damage by lipopigment aggregation; a ubiquitous accumulation in lipopigments occurs in neurons, primarily concentrated in the cerebral and cerebellar cortices. This accumulation results in atrophy in these regions of the brain, and cause the pathogenesis of signs and symptoms of Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease. Currently, it is unclear what mechanism in relation to enzyme activity is responsible for the buildup of lipoproteins. Diagnosis Diagnosis of Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease is increasingly based on assay of enzyme activity and molecular genetic testing. Thirteen pathogenic candidate genes‚ÄîPPT1, TPP1, CLN3, CLN5, CLN6, MFSD8, CLN8, CTSD, DNAJC5, CTSF, ATP13A2 GRN, KCTD7‚Äîare associated with the development of the disease. Patients with Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease typically have up to 50% reduced lysosomal enzymes, and thus an enzyme activity assay is a quick and easy diagnostic test. Vision impairment is an early symptom of Jansky‚ÄìBielschowsky disease, and so an eye exam is another common diagnostic tool. During the eye exam, loss of cells within the eye would indicate the presence of the disease however more tests are needed for a complete diagnosis. Other common diagnostic tests include: * Blood or urine test: Elevated levels of the chemical dolichol found in the urine is typical of individuals with the disease, as well as the presence of vacuolated lymphocytes in the blood. * Skin or tissue sampling: Microscopy of skin could be used to observe lipopigment aggregation. * CT scan or MRI: Visualization of the brain would be able to detect areas of cerebral atrophy. Treatment On April 27, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Brineura (cerliponase alfa) as the first specific treatment for NCL. Brineura is enzyme replacement therapy manufactured through recombinant DNA technology. The active ingredient in Brineura, cerliponase alpha, is intended to slow loss of walking ability in symptomatic pediatric patients 3 years of age and older with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis type 2 (CLN2), also known as tripeptidyl peptidase-1 (TPP1) deficiency. Brineura is administered into the cerebrospinal fluid by infusion via a surgically implanted reservoir and catheter in the head (intraventricular access device). Eponym It is named for Jan Jansk√Ω and Max Bielschowsky.

Among his creative endeavors, he has done volcanic research and photography, has co-directed a science documentary film, founded a fine fragrance company, and has authored a book on photography, scheduled to be released in 2008. Biographical notes Biography The son of Cleveland and Lillian Hopkins, Douglas Hopkins grew up in Alaska and Boston.Obituary, Cleveland Hopkins, 2003 As a young man, Hopkins worked as a ranch hand in Montana. In high school he spent a year in Europe studying German. He attended the University of California, San Diego where he majored in physics and German literature. He later attended MIT, where he became a senior staff member of the MIT Department of Earth & Planetary Sciences. At MIT he designed and deployed a system for measuring the ballistics of volcano eruptions. From 1971 to 1973 he worked at several volcanic sites, including the Italian islands of Sicily and Stromboli, as well as Guatemala and Chile. Hopkins' interest in commercial photography began to emerge while taking personal close-hand photographs of volcanic eruptions. In 1972 Hopkins completed an intensive program in teaching visual awareness with the reclusive Massachusetts Institute of Technology photography professor, Minor White, author of The Zone System Manual and colleague of Ansel Adams. With Dr. Kathleen Crane, Hopkins co-directed the science documentary film \\"Heat\\". The film, funded by the Charles Lindbergh Foundation, was about geothermal phenomena. Hopkins pursued a twenty-year career in commercial photography that has included staff, freelance, and consulting work. He has worked for numerous fashion, beauty, travel, and general publications, and his photographs have appeared in posters, books, and on national television. During his early years, Hopkins was innovative in the use of computers for photography-related business purposes. In the mid-1980s, at the beginning of the period known as perestroika, Hopkins travelled to Eastern Europe. At this time Hopkins became interested in fine fragrances and purchased the rights to the leading Soviet men‚Äôs cologne, Prastara. In 1989, Hopkins founded his own fragrance company. In January 1999, while on the Internet, Hopkins met a Russian woman, Oksana Katsuro, and began conversing with her via email. At the time, Ms. Katsuro was living and working as a nuclear engineer in Obninsk, Russia. In August 1999, Ms. Katsuro moved to New York and on November 6 of that year, she and Hopkins were married. She obtained her PhD in fusion physics from Columbia University. They have one daughter. Wedding article, New York Times, 1999 Photos from 2004‚Äì2007 Most recently, Hopkins has written a book, \\"Real Views\\", for amateur photographers that was scheduled to be released in 2011. Hopkins currently lives in New York City and continues to direct his fragrance company. D Hopkins interview Photography Hopkins' approach to photography was influenced by the intensive visual awareness program he took with MIT professor Minor White. Some of Hopkins' early photographs of volcano eruptions appeared in popular and technical publications and textbooks. Working in this environment could be dangerous; regarding one of these photographs, Hopkins made the notation: \\"About 100 feet away. Almost ate it.\\" During this period, his first photographic cover was published by ‚ÄúHarvard‚Äù, the university alumni magazine. After assisting several commercial and portrait photographers, Hopkins' first job in commercial photography was as a staff photographer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. By the early 1980s, Hopkins had free-lanced for Women's Wear Daily, Vogue, Mademoiselle, and Self. At that time, Hopkins was already using computers in his work to keep track of business contacts and to record photo shoot details, photo credits, and expenses. Having a technical background, he built a computer (a CPM-based Heathkit machine) and to write early business programs. His early computer work is described in a 1985 article which includes a picture of Hopkins with a young model in the background. He commented that this was the model's first shooting and she was so excited by the event that she fainted to the floor shortly after the photo was taken. Computer magazine article, 1985 During his photography career, Hopkins free-lanced for W, WWD, Vogue, Connoisseur, Harvard Magazine, Rolling Stone, Mademoiselle, Elle, Barrons, Cosmopolitan, New York Times, Revlon, Clairol, and L'Oreal. Some interesting comments on his work: * Hopkins photographed a cover shot for W magazine that featured supermodel Janice Dickinson in a busy Times Square street. The cover was important because of the clothes worn by Ms Dickenson and was said by the publisher of W, John Fairchild, to be the best ever cover of W magazine. * In the early 1980s, Hopkins photographed an aerial view of a Steinway Concert Grand piano, and the image became available as an art poster. Henry Z. Steinway would say that this photograph was ‚ÄúThe best photo of a Steinway ever made.‚Äù * Hopkins photographed a book cover portrait for MIT professor and author Dr. Sherry Turkle. Wired magazine published a story on Dr. Turkle and noted that the photo was a turning point in her life. Among the personalities Hopkins has photographed are Phoebe and Valerie Cates, Sharon Stone, Alexandra Paul, Mia farrow, and Andy Warhol. Interview in Scented Salamander Hopkins has remained active in the photography field through commissioned portraits, exhibits, design awards, articles, lecturing, and teaching at The New School in New York City. He has also served as a consultant to clients such as Polaroid and Fuji. Regarding his new book, Hopkins calls it \\"a guide to creative vision for amateur digital photographers, a manual of creative visual awareness. I would like to enhance the amateur photographer‚Äôs ability to endow lasting images of ambience and emotion.\\" Media coverage Hopkins has received professional coverage in publications such as Graphis, The New York Times (op-ed, article co-author and photography), Popular Photography (cover), American Photographer (cover), and Photo District News. He has appeared on numerous television shows, sometimes with his wife Oksana. Some of these shows include The Montel Show, Star Search, and Inside Edition. He has also appeared on Internet shows such as Rocketboom. Perfume development In 1989, Hopkins started the fragrance company Douglas Hopkins and Company, at first based in his duplex on the Upper East Side in New York City. In industry terms, the company is referred to as an international atelier perfumer. Hopkins' company states that his products are based on centuries-old formulas and are packaged like perfumes in a Parisian apothecary. His products have been sold at Bergdorf Goodman in New York City, the Versaille museum, Galeries Lafayette in Paris, and others. Hopkins' original mentor in perfume production was George Diamond, who holds many patents in perfume production. Hopkins and Diamond had initially intended to create a \\"Valentina\\" fragrance, named for the ballerina Valentina Kozlova, whom Hopkins had photographed. Hopkins determined that higher-quality Russian cosmetics were mostly made in Eastern Europe. After the Berlin wall went down, Hopkins and Diamond went to Eastern Europe looking for investments. They were invited to cosmetic factories where production was still done in a primitive manner, using mostly manual labor and horse-drawn carts. Although Diamond had returned to the United States, on the last day of his trip Hopkins stumbled upon a tiny remote fragrance plant. The factory was a Communist-run coop that made one fragrance called Prastara. Hopkins acquired the Prostara trademark, which allowed him to market the fragrance worldwide, except in Russia. Hopkins questioned the previous owners and determined that the fragrance probably originated with the chemist of Louis XV of France, because the king's mistress (and later his wife) Marie Leczinska was of Polish royalty. As a result of his portrait work, Douglas became friends with a young German engineer and his wife who were from old European families. On one occasion when Hopkins was visiting the family at a castle in Austria, he was able to do some research on Prostara in their library. There he discovered a rare 18th century perfuming manual, which helped define the future direction of the company. Douglas Hopkins' women's fragrances include √Öse, Zazou, and Prastara. Men's fragrances include Prastara Royal and Prastara Blue. Hopkins describes Zazou as \\"the California scent with a hint of sanity.\\" Product brochure Hopkins has an interesting perspective on the fragrance industry: The company also sells Geothermology, a personal treatment line, launched in 2005 with 35 products. This line \\"offers the volcanic and natural mineral substances derived from multiple, active, naturally occurring geothermal healing sources around the world\\".

She was named in honor of Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills of South Dakota. The ship was originally authorized under the Lend-Lease Act as BAPM-6, the sixth of seven British Mechanized Artillery Transports. Reclassified a Landing Ship Dock, LSD-14, on 1 July 1942, the contract for LSD-14 was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co., Newport News, Virginia, on 10 September 1942. She was laid down on 31 December 1943, originally to be named HMS Sword, and later HMS Swashway (F145). While under construction, LSD-14, as well as -13 and -15, were reassigned back to the United States. The ship was launched as Rushmore on 10 May 1944, sponsored by Miss Eleanor Vreelan Blewitt; and commissioned on 3 July 1944, Lieutenant Commander E. A. Jansen, USNR, in command.  1944 ‚Äì 1946  Rushmore in World War II. Following shakedown in the Chesapeake Bay, landing ship dock Rushmore departed Norfolk on 5 August 1944 for the Pacific where she participated in four amphibious landings: the Battle of Leyte in October 1944; of Palawan in February 1945; of Mindanao in March 1945; and of Tarakan, Borneo, in May 1945. Rushmore entered Leyte Gulf early in the morning of 20 October, and after discharging her LCMs from her boat well in one of the first waves to hit Yellow Beach near Dulag, Leyte, acted as repair ship for damaged landing craft. At Palawan on 28 February 1945, she landed Army-manned LCMs and other craft loaded with personnel and equipment of the 167th Field Artillery of the U.S. 8th Army. At Mindanao she carried a record 867 men for a 10 March landing on a beach north of Zamboanga City. For the invasion of Tarakan on 1 May, Rushmore carried U.S. Army-manned LCMs loaded with Australian troops and light tanks. The Australian troops were a battalion of the famed \\"Rats of Tobruk\\" which had helped to chase German General Erwin Rommel out of Africa. During this landing, Rushmore was hit by a Japanese torpedo fired from the beach, which fortunately glanced off her hull without exploding or causing damage. Returning to the Philippines, Rushmore loaded a 137-foot Japanese army submarine Yu 3 which she carried to San Francisco to serve as a display to help sell war bonds. In the United States from 2 to 27 June, Rushmore next carried landing craft from base to base in the South Pacific and was in Pearl Harbor when the war ended. After the war, Rushmore operated in the Far East, particularly in occupied Japanese waters. She decommissioned 16 August 1946 and was mothballed in Pascagoula, Mississippi.  1950 ‚Äì 1993  Rushmore recommissioned at Charleston, S.C., on 21 September 1950, to begin a period of Atlantic Fleet service. Her next ten years included Caribbean exercises, Reserve cruises, a Mediterranean cruise, and regular Arctic trips to resupply the DEW Line bases. Rushmore was present for ceremonies at Istanbul, Turkey, in May 1954 on the occasion of the return of various small lend-lease vessels from the USSR. Rushmore returned these ex-Soviet Navy vessels to the United States. On 16 May 1960, Rushmore departed Norfolk for a 6-month tour with the 6th Fleet. Returning to the Atlantic coast, she again deployed to the Mediterranean in late 1961. Returning to Little Creek, Va. on 22 February 1962, she operated in the Atlantic and Caribbean before a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. On 9 November Rushmore hurriedly left the Bethlehem Steel Yards, Hoboken, N.J., because of the Cuban Missile Crisis and sailed to North Carolina to embark Marine units. However, with the easing of the situation in December, she returned to Little Creek. On 4 February 1963, Rushmore began a 5-month deployment to the Mediterranean. From December until February 1964, she operated in the Caribbean, remaining near the Panama Canal Zone area during and after the riots there, ready to land troops to protect American citizens and Government property. Operating in the Atlantic and Caribbean until 6 October, she then departed the United States for Europe and the largest amphibious assault yet staged in peacetime, Operation Steel Pike. She returned to Little Creek on 26 November. Rushmore was again deployed to the Mediterranean from 8 February to 24 July 1965, participating in joint Norwegian-American and French-American exercises. In the summer of 1966 Rushmore made two midshipmen cruises. For the next four years she alternated deployments to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean with operations off the U.S. Atlantic coast. She deployed to the Mediterranean November 1966 ‚Äì May 1967, January‚ÄìMay 1968, and November 1969 ‚Äì April 1970. Ordered inactivated soon after her return, Rushmore decommissioned 30 September 1970 and was transferred to the Maritime Administration's National Defense Reserve Fleet, at Fort Eustis on the James River, in February 1971. The old dock landing ship was finally sunk as a target on 16 April 1993.  Awards  Rushmore earned three battle stars for World War II service.

Biography =Early life and education= Hilferty grew up in a big family in Arlington, Massachusetts, where her greatest source of joy was the library. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt have a television,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúReading was my entertainment.‚Äù says Hilferty, whose interest in art and designing clothing led to her making all of her own clothes by the age of 12. As an undergraduate at Syracuse University, Hilferty majored in painting with a minor in fashion design. She also fulfilled her work-study responsibilities in the school‚Äôs theatre. She credits her Junior year, studying abroad in London as the experience that led her to designing for the theatre. ‚ÄúI had been in plays as a child, but I‚Äôd never actually seen a production onstage. It turned me on to theater design because I immediately understood how the visuals are an integral part of storytelling. I see myself as a storyteller who happens to use clothes as my medium.‚Äù After graduating from Syracuse, Hilferty headed to New York City, where she worked as a freelance costume designer as well as in a costume shop and as a draper for a few years before earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in theater design from the Yale School of Drama. =Career= Susan Hilferty has designed costumes for more than 300 productions all around the world. She is perhaps best known for her work on the musical Wicked, currently represented on Broadway and in cities across the globe. For her work on Wicked, Hilferty was awarded the 2004 Tony Award for Best Costume Design, Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Costume Design and Outer Critics Circle Award. Other Broadway credits include Spring Awakening, Into the Woods (2002 Revival), Lestat and Assassins. Her many collaborations include productions with such well-known directors as Joe Mantello, James Lapine, Michael Mayer, Walter Bobbie, Robert Falls, Tony Kushner, Robert Woodruff, JoAnne Akalaitis, the late Garland Wright, James MacDonald, Bartlett Sher, Mark Lamos, Frank Galati, Des McAnuff, Christopher Ashley, Emily Mann, David Jones, Marion McClinton, Neil Pepe, Rebecca Taichman, Gregory Boyd, Laurie Anderson, Doug Wright, Carole Rothman, Oskar Eustis, Garry Hynes, Richard Nelson and Athol Fugard (the South African writer with whom she works as set and costume designer and often as co- director since 1980). Her work in regional theatre in the United States includes productions with A.C.T San Francisco, ACT Seattle, The Acting Company, Alley Theatre, Alliance Theatre, Baltimore Center Stage, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, Berkshire Theatre Festival, Center Theare Group, Court Theatre (Chicago), Geffen Playhouse, Goodman Theatre, Guthrie Theater, Hartford Stage, Huntington Theatre Company, Kennedy Center, La Jolla Playhouse, Long Wharf Theatre, McCarter Theatre, New York Stage and Film, Old Globe Theatre, Pasadena Playhouse, Seattle Repertory Theatre, Signature Theatre (Arlington, Virginia), Trinity Rep, Williamstown Theatre Festival, and the Yale Repertory Theatre. In addition to her career as a costume designer, Hilferty has designed sets as well as directed. She currently acts as Chair of the Design for Stage and Film department of New York University's Tisch School of the Arts in New York City. When asked what qualities she considers important in potential students, Hilferty replied, ‚ÄúI look for curiosity. I find that unless someone is ready, willing, and able to open themselves up to any number of cultures and stories, they can‚Äôt be a designer. Our role as designers is to create a culture. In any given year, I could be working on a play set in South Africa in the 1970s, a musical based on a very small specific Texas town, and a Musical based on a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale. The list goes on, and as designers, we have to constantly be thrilled to ask, ‚ÄòWhat was it like in New York City in 1974? What was it like in India in 1642?

The eighth season consists of 22 episodes. Plot After being gone for five years, Susan Lewis returns to the show providing continuity of the earlier years and some closure with Greene. Greene begins to experience health problems and deals with Rachel after she starts causing problems. In addition, Weaver also has a revelation and confronts and accepts her sexuality. The season's long story line of Greene's illness and death and how it affects many characters marks Season 8 as a major turning point in the series. This season also saw a major change in the cast, with four characters leaving, including original characters Greene and Benton as well as Cleo and Dave. Abby helps a neighbor, but faces repercussions and Kovac punches the man who clobbered Abby. In turn, two new main characters with very different personalities - Michael Gallant and Greg Pratt - are introduced in Season 8. For the first time, John Carter is centered as the main character of the show at the end of the season. In this season, several staff members face personal and professional pressures, including Greene and Corday who face the most difficult issue of all when their baby overdoses on Ecstasy pills. The two argue after their baby nearly dies. Weaver becomes more aggressive and she accepts that she is a lesbian. Greene's final episode as a regular character is the 21st episode of Season 8. Benton and Finch also leave to make new changes in their lives. After Greene's death, many of the characters become affected, especially Carter who reads two letters to the staff.

In April 2012 the film became available on DVD from the Warner Archive collection. Plot The Blackbird (Lon Chaney) is a thief who uses a second identity when necessary. He lives above a cheap bar in the Limehouse district, where his alter ego The Bishop, is beloved among all guests. One evening, the police drop by looking for him after a robbery, and he flees to a vaudeville theater, where his ex-wife Limehouse Polly (Doris Lloyd) has an act. Since their divorce they have become bitter towards one another, but Polly is willing to admit that she once married The Blackbird 'because she saw the soul in him that he did not know he got himself'. Furthermore, she admits to her father that she is still in love with him. The Blackbird, though, has become infatuated by Mademoiselle Fifi Lorraine (Ren√©e Ador√©e), another performer and Polly's rival. He gives her a gun as a gift, explaining to her that someone as pretty as her should have a pistol or a man to protect her. Fifi prefers a diamond collar, and turns to a much wealthier guest in turn, West End Bertie (Owen Moore). The Blackbird catches him stealing a diamond collar for Fifi, but after a battle, he is the one handing it over to her. Nevertheless, Bertie wins her affection and takes her home at the end of the night. When The Blackbird finds out that Bertie and Fifi have become engaged, he poses as The Bishop to reveal to Fifi that Bertie is a crook. Bertie admits this, but twists the story to make him look sympathetic, thereby making Fifi fall for him even more. Seeing how the plan backfired, The Blackbird turns Bertie in to a Scotland Yard inspector. Before they can get him for robbery and murder, Fifi decides to help her fiance hide, something she afterwards reveals to The Bishop. Seeing how she is now involved, The Blackbirds changes his plans and, posed as The Bishop, offers Bertie a bed in his secret room. To drive them apart, The Bishop tells Bertie that he can not escape because the police are looking for him in the Limehouse district, and claims to Fifi that Bertie will escape that night, on his own. Fifi offers Bertie to go along, but when he responds that he is not going because of the police, she thinks that he is lying to her and starts an argument. During this, Bertie is set up to believe that Fifi told the cops on him, and she leaves in tears. Meanwhile, Polly finds out that the police are also looking for The Blackbird for killing a Scotland Yarder. Just as The Blackbird and Fifi are about to kiss, Polly drops by to share the terrible news. Realizing the setting she has walked in, she turns her back on The Blackbird, which causes him to respond in anger, thereby scaring off Fifi. At that moment, the police barges in. The Blackbird is able to dress himself up as The Bishop, but falls and breaks his back during the process, thereby actually becoming crippled. When Polly is asked to burn his clothes, she realizes that The Blackbird and The Bishop are the same. In the end, Fifi and Bertie are reunited. With Polly's help, The Blackbird is able to trick the police for a final time, but he dies in the aftermath.

Taking up the larger part of the Neelam Valley, the district has a population of (as of 2017). It was badly affected by the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.  Location  The Neelum River was known before Partition as Kishan Ganga and was subsequently renamed after the village of Neelam.. The village is upstream from Athmuqam. An alternative etymology links the name to the colour of the river: \\"sapphire\\". It flows down from the Gurez Valley in Indian Jammu and Kashmir and roughly follows first a western and then a south- western course until it joins the Jhelum River at Muzaffarabad. The valley is a thickly wooded region with an elevation ranging between and , the mountain peaks on either side reaching . Neelum Valley is long. Most of the valley is taken up by the Neelum District(). The district is bordered on the south-west by Muzaffarabad District, which also encompasses the lower reaches of the valley; to the north-west beyond the mountains lies the Kaghan Valley in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Mansehra District; to the north and north-east are the Diamer, Astore and Skardu districts of Gilgit-Baltistan. To the south and east are the Kupwara and Bandipora districts of Indian Kashmir. The Line of Control runs through the valley ‚Äì either across the mountains to the south-east, or in places right along the river, with several villages on the left bank falling on the Indian side of the border.; . Administration Dosut Neelum District was part of Muzaffarabad District until 2005. It is made up of two tehsils: Athmuqam, which contains the district headquarters, and Sharda. Neelum District is the largest district of Azad Kashmir by area. The valley extends for approximately 200 kilometers along the Neelum River. This is a generally poor region, reliant on subsistence agriculture and handicrafts, with tourism growing in importance in recent years. According to the Alif Ailaan Pakistan District Education Rankings 2015, Neelum is ranked 33 out of 148 districts in terms of education. For facilities and infrastructure, the district is ranked 136 out of 148. Dosut, Neelum Valley in winter Languages Several languages are spoken natively in the district. The predominant one is Hindko. It is the language of wider communication in the area and is spoken at a native or near-native level by almost all members of the other language communities, many of whom are abandoning their language and shifting to Hindko. This language is usually called Parmi (or Parimi, PƒÅrim), a name that likely originated in the Kashmiri word 'from the other side', which was the term used by the Kashmiris of the Vale of Kashmir to refer to the highlanders, who spoke this language. The language is also sometimes known as Pahari, although it bears a closer resemblance to the Hindko of neighbouring Kaghan Valley than to the Pahari spoken in the Murree Hills.. The variant Parimi as well as the local use of the terms Pahari and Hindko are from . Unlike other varieties of Hindko, Pahari or Punjabi, it has preserved the voiced aspirated consonants at the start of the word: for example, gha 'grass' vs. Punjabi k√†, where the aspiration and voicing have been lost giving rise to a low tone on the following vowel. This sound change however, is currently spreading here as well, but it has so far only affected the villages situated along the Neelam highway. This variety of Hindko is also spoken in nearby areas of India-administered Kashmir. Since Partition, the language varieties on either side of the Line of Control have diverged in a number of ways. For example, in the Neelam Valley, there is a higher proportion of Urdu loanwords, while the variety spoken across the Line of Control has retained more traditional Hindko words. The second most widely spoken language of the Neelam Valley is Kashmiri. It is the majority language in at least a dozen or so villages, and in about half of these it is it the sole mother tongue. It is closer to the variety spoken in northern Kashmir (particularly Kupwara) than to the Kashmiri of the city of Muzaffarabad. The third-largest ethnic, though not linguistic, group are the Gujjars, whose villages are scattered throughout the valley. Most of them have switched to Hindko, but a few communities continue using the Gujari language at home. Gujari is more consistently maintained among the Bakarwal, who travel into the valley (and beyond into Gilgit-Baltistan) with their herds in the summer and who spend the winters in the lower parts of Azad Kashmir and in Punjab. In the upper end of the valley, there are two distinct communities speaking two different varieties of Shina (locally sometimes called Dardi). One of them is found at Taobutt and the nearby village of Karimabad (formerly known as Sutti) near the border with India. Its speakers claim that their variety of Shina is close to the one spoken further up the valley in Indian Gurez. The community is bilingual in Kashmiri and is culturally closer to the neighbouring Kashmiri communities than to the other Shina group, who inhabit the large village of Phulwei downstream. The Shina people of Phullwei claim to have originally come from Nait near Chilas in Gilgit-Baltistan. A Pashto dialect is spoken in two villages (Dhaki and Changnar) that are situated on the Line of Control. Because of cross-border firing since the early 1990s, there has been large- scale migration away from these villages. The local dialect is not completely intelligible with the ones spoken in the rest of Pakistan. One language that is unique to the Neelam Valley is the endangered Kundal Shahi. It is spoken by some of the inhabitants of the Kundal Shahi village near Athmuqam. Additionally, Urdu is spoken by the formally educated and, like English, is used as a medium of instruction in schools.

The term \\"Oxbridge\\" is a portmanteau of Oxford and Cambridge. The term has received some criticism for its derogatory and elitist nature. Eric Thomas, vice-chancellor of Bristol University, has criticised it because of the way in which it makes people view British higher education through an Oxbridge prism.Liz Lightfoot, Bristol may reject candidates who favour Oxbridge, The Telegraph, 21 January 2004. In 2000, Gordon Brown, then Chancellor of the Exchequer and subsequently Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, started a major political row about higher education when he accused Oxford University of elitism in its admissions procedures. The Laura Spence Affair, as it became known, is one of the most publicised cases of an Oxbridge reject. Rejected from Magdalen College, Oxford, to read medicine, Laura Spence went on to study with a scholarship at Harvard in the United States. The rejection was seen as discrimination because of her state-school background.The war of Laura's rejection, The Observer, 28 May 2000. She subsequently went on to study graduate-entry medicine (a 4-year course) at Wolfson College, Cambridge. In 2016, The Tab asked students at the University of Durham, \\"which Oxbridge college rejected you and why\\". Further stating, \\"It‚Äôs common knowledge that the majority of Durham‚Äôs student body are Oxbridge rejects.\\" The perception that most Durham students were rejected from either Oxford or Cambridge has led to the tongue-in-cheek term Doxbridge, which highlights the similarities that Durham has with the two other universities.

He was primarily responsible, together with his wife Goar Vartanian, for thwarting Operation Long Jump, concocted by Adolf Hitler, headed by Ernst Kaltenbrunner, and led by Otto Skorzeny, which was an attempt to assassinate Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt at the Tehran conference in 1943. Early life Vartanian was born to Armenian parents in Nor Nakhichevan, USSR. His father was a Soviet intelligence agent as well who was sent to Persia in 1930, where he worked for 23 years under a cover of a wealthy merchant. Gevork Vartanian was not even 16 when he went into intelligence.RussiaToday : Spotlight On 4 February 1940, he made contact with the Tehran residency of Soviet intelligence, including Ivan Agayants. In Tehran, Vartanian formed a pro-Soviet group, who were identified by Iranian police in 1941, which led him to spend three months in prison. Operation Long Jump In 1942, Adolf Hitler decided to set the operation in motion. After careful planning and deliberation under the personal supervision of Security Police Chief Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Hitler sent his special commando agent, Otto Skorzeny, along with six other men to rendezvous at Tehran and spearhead the operation. The plan entailed the capture and/or assassination of Josef Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt. The first tip-off about the planned attempt came from Soviet intelligence agent Nikolai Kuznetsov, under the alias of Wehrmacht Oberleutnant Paul Siebert, from Nazi- occupied Ukraine. Kuznetsov got a drunk SS officer named Ulrich von Ortel to tell him about the attempt. Although the scheduled date of the operation was not known, the fact that it would take place was confirmed. Vartanian had been assigned to recruit agents since 1940. In 1940‚Äì41 Vartanian's team of seven intelligence officers had identified more than 400 Nazi agents, all of whom had been arrested by Soviet troops. In the autumn of 1943, they were assigned the task of ensuring the security for the upcoming Tehran conference. In their efforts to foil the assassination plot devised by the Nazis, Vartanian's group located six Nazi radio operators shortly before the conference opened on 28 November 1943. The German assassins had been dropped by parachute near the town of Qom, 40 miles from Tehran. Vartanian later said: All the members of the first group were arrested and forced to contact their handlers under Soviet supervision. The operation got off track and the main group led by Skorzeny never went to Tehran.Yury Plutenko (16 October 2007) \\"Tehran-43: Wrecking the plan to kill Stalin, Roosevelt and Churchill\\", RIA Novosti. Later years On 30 June 1946, Vartanian married Goar Levonovna. In 1955, Vartanian graduated from the Institute of Foreign Languages, Yerevan. He then spent three decades doing espionage activities in Japan, China, India, France, Italy, United States and West Germany. He was awarded the Hero of the Soviet Union medal in 1984. In 2003, relying on declassified documents, Yuri Lvovich Kuznets published a book called Tehran-43 or Operation Long Jump, which detailed Vartanian's role at the Tehran Conference. A Soviet film, Teheran 43, which featured the French actor Alain Delon, was released in 1981. In 2007 he met with Winston Churchill's granddaughter and was congratulated for his great service to the Allies. Vartanian has been interviewed many times. Al Gurnov of Russia Today interviewed Vartanian on the eve of the Victory Day parade, which was broadcast on 9 May 2008. It was revealed that Vartanian's identity was kept secret until 2000, when he finally received full credit for putting a stop to the assassination plot. Death Gevork Vartanian died at 87 at Botkin Hospital in Moscow on 10 January 2012. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended the funeral and paid his respects to Vartanian's widow Goar, a fellow intelligence officer, who died on 25 November 2019.Russian spy who 'changed the course of history', Goar Vartanyan, dies aged 93 ABC News, 29 November 2019. Retrieved 29 November 2019. Russian President Dmitry Medvedev expressed his condolences to Vartanian's friends and relatives. He described Vartanian as \\"a legendary intelligence agent, a genuine patriot of his country, a bright and extraordinary person.... He took part in splendid operations, which went down in the history of the Russian foreign intelligence service. His death is an irretrievable loss to his family and all those who knew and highly appreciated the legendary man.\\" Condolences were also expressed by the President of Armenia Serzh Sargsyan, Prime Minister of Armenia Tigran Sargsyan, and President of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Bako Sahakyan.

He had a 3-month loan spell at Yeovil Town in 2001 scoring 4 goals in 17 games. Followed by another loan spell at Bognor Regis. Failing to make the first team Scott was released by Micky Adams after a breach of his contract in 2001. On leaving Brighton and Hove Albion he joined Dover Athletic on a free transfer Non League Ramsay played 13 games at Dover Athletic scoring only a single goal in a five-month spell before transferring back to East Sussex signing to Eastbourne Borough, who were then in the Southern League. In 2003, Brentford sparked an interest in signing Scott for ¬£25,000 after scoring 33 goals in the 2002/2003 season. Ramsay took two training sessions with the Bees, but Scott was reluctant to sign. In the six years at Eastbourne Borough, Scott bagged 135 goals in 283 appearances, and helped the sussex side win the Sussex Senior Cup in 2002 and into the FA Cup first round in 2006 for the first time in the club's history. He also aided their rise into the Conference South football league and was part of the team that won a promotion into the Conference National league. In June 2008, Ramsay left Eastbourne Borough after failing to agree to a new contract, signing for Hastings United, who \\"beat off competition from several higher league sides\\", such as AFC Wimbledon and Havant & Waterlooville to sign the prolific striker. Whilst at Hastings he converted to a central defensive role from his more familiar role as a striker. In 2010, Ramsay moved to Rye United and played at the club until 2012.

Plot Cock Robin (John Gilbert) is a sideshow barker in Budapest. He also participates in one of the acts; his former girlfriend Salome (Ren√©e Ador√©e) dances before Herod in exchange for the head of \\"Jokanaan\\". As Jokanaan, Robin has his head seemingly chopped off and presented to the dancer on a platter, much to the delight of the audience. Salome wants to get back together with Robin, but he has his sights set on Lena (Gertrude Short), the daughter of a well-off sheep merchant. He lets the smitten Lena buy him things. The Greek (Lionel Barrymore), Salome's current boyfriend, becomes angered when he learns of her feelings. The Greek and his henchman, the Ferret, also try to steal Lena's father's money, but fail to find it after they murder him. That night, a heartbroken Lena tells Robin that her father has been killed. She trustingly shows him the substantial amount of money she had been holding for her father; when Robin ascertains that she has no brothers and that she has many more sheep, he becomes very interested. However, Salome eavesdrops, bursts in and warns Lena that Robin is only after her for her wealth. Lena flees, without her money. Robin is furious and can barely restrain himself from beating Salome. When Lena shows up at the sideshow with a policeman, Salome has Robin hide in her attic. One day, an old blind man (Edward Connelly), another resident of the building, comes to Salome to have her read to him another letter from his son; Salome tells him that the man has been promoted to captain and received a decoration. She assures the old man that his son will return someday with his regiment. Later, however, she reveals to Robin that the son is actually in the prison across the street, scheduled to be hanged the next morning. That morning, the old man hears voices in Salome's room and assumes his son has finally come home. Bursting with joy, he mistakes Robin for his son and takes him to his room, where he puts on his old uniform. Then, just after his real son is executed, he passes away. The Greek first tries to rid himself of his romantic rival by taking the place of the \\"executioner\\" and using a real sword to lop of Robin's head, but Salome sees through his disguise and stops him. When Robin goes into hiding, the Greek steals another sideshow attraction, a poisonous lizard, and plants it in Salome's attic. An official calls on Salome to inform her that she can claim her brother's possessions at the prison; Robin then realizes that the old man was her father. Thoroughly ashamed of himself, Robin reconciles with her. However, the official had spotted him hiding behind the door. When a policeman comes to arrest him, Robin hides in the attic, where the Greek has also been trapped. In the ensuing scuffle, the Greek is bitten by the lizard. Robin takes the money from his dead body and gives it to the policeman. For returning it voluntarily, Robin is let off. He and Salome return to the sideshow. When next they perform the act, she kisses him while his head is on the platter.

The walkway leads past Koseze Pond and across Golovec Hill. During World War II, the Province of Ljubljana, annexed by Fascist Italy, was subjected to brutal repression after the emergence of resistance and the Italian forces erected a barbed wire fence‚Äîthe route of which is now the Trail of Remembrance and Comradeship‚Äîaround Ljubljana in order to prevent communication between the city's underground Liberation Front activists in Ljubljana and the Slovene Partisans in the surrounding countryside. The construction of the trail started in 1974 and was completed in 1985. It is marked by signposts, information boards with the map of the trail, plaques, and metal markers, as well as signposts at the turn-offs. One hundred and two octagonal memorial stones, designed by the architect Vlasto Kopaƒç, have been installed at the former positions of the bunkers. Along the green area adjacent to it, 7,400 trees of 49 tree species have been planted. Since 1988, it has been protected as a designed nature monument. The trail is used by many residents of Ljubljana each day. The most popular form of recreation on it is walking and jogging. Cycling is also permitted on condition that pedestrians are not endangered. During snowy winters, cross-country ski tracks are provided at some of its sections. Each year since 1957, on the weekend closest to 9 May, the traditional recreational March along the Wire (; it held several names since its beginning) takes place to mark the liberation of Ljubljana on 9 May 1945. Those who walk the entire distance and collect stamps at all eight checkpoints receive a memorial badge and a medal. Because of Ljubljana's growth over the years, some areas of the path now pass through built-up areas. Examples include the segment from Koseze crossing Klagenfurt Street (Celov≈°ka cesta) and Vienna Street (Dunajska cesta) and ending near Sto≈æice Stadium.

Plot After John Sutter's aristocratic wife killed her Mafia don lover, John left America and set out in his sailboat on a three-year journey around the world, eventually settling in London. Now, ten years later, he has come home to the Gold Coast, that stretch of land on the North Shore of Long Island that once held the greatest concentration of wealth and power in America, to attend the imminent funeral of an old family servant. Taking up temporary residence in the gatehouse of Stanhope Hall, John finds himself living only a quarter of a mile from Susan, his aristocratic ex-wife, who has also returned to Long Island.

During 1788 these pioneers to the Ohio Country established Marietta, Ohio, as the first permanent American settlement of the new United States in the Northwest Territory, and opened the westward expansion of the new country. General George Washington commented about these pioneers: \\"I know many of the settlers personally, and there never were men better calculated to promote the welfare of such a community.\\"Sparks, Writings of George Washington, Vol IX, 385. General Lafayette of France, who fought with the Americans during the Revolution, visited Marietta on his US tour during May 1825 and described these pioneers and former officers: \\"They were the bravest of brave. Better men never lived.\\"Cutler, Life and Times of Ephraim Cutler, 202‚Äì03. The historian David McCullough noted that these pioneers were: \\"characters of historic accomplishment who were entirely unknown to most Americans\\".McCullough, The Pioneers, 259. The first group of these early American pioneers to the Northwest Territory is sometimes referred to as \\"the forty-eight\\" or the \\"first forty-eight\\", and also as the \\"founders of Ohio\\".Cutler, The Founders of Ohio, 1-28.Stevenson, Poems of American History, 335. These first forty-eight men were carefully chosen and vetted by several of the co-founders of the Ohio Company of Associates, Rufus Putnam and Manasseh Cutler, to ensure not only men of high character and bravery, but also men with proven skills necessary to build a settlement in the wilderness.Cutler, The Founders of Ohio, 5-6.Zimmer, True Stories from Pioneer Valley, 18. During 1852 the president of the Ohio Historical Society described these pioneers:Hildreth, Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio, v. \\"So various and eventful lives as theirs have scarcely ever fallen to the lot of man. They were born under a monarchy,‚Äîfought the battle of Independence,‚Äîassisted in the baptism of a great republic,‚Äîthen moved into a wilderness,‚Äîand laid the foundations of a State,‚Äîitself almost equaling an empire. These men not only lived in remarkable times, but were themselves remarkable men. Energetic, industrious, persevering, honest, bold, and free ‚Äî they were limited in their achievements only by the limits of possibility. Successful alike in field and forest,‚Äîthey have, at length, gone to their rest,‚Äîleaving names which are a part of the fame and the history of their country\\". On the centennial anniversary of the Marietta settlement, Senator George F. Hoar of Massachusetts orated, \\"It was an illustrious band; they were men of exceptional character, talents and attainments; they were the best of New England culture; they were Revolutionary heroes\\".Randall and Ryan, History of Ohio, 458. Massachusetts to Ohio Under the leadership of Rufus Putnam, two parties of pioneers comprising the first forty-eight men departed New England, cutting trails westward through the mountains during an uncommonly severe winter. One party departed from the towns of Ipswich, Massachusetts and Danvers, Massachusetts on December 3, 1787; the other party departed from Hartford, Connecticut on January 1, 1788. The pioneers crossed the mountains and met at Sumrill's Ferry (present-day West Newton, Pennsylvania) on the Youghiogheny River. During the bitterly cold winter, the men built two flatboats, the forty-five-ton Adventure Galley (also known as the Mayflower, in honor of their Pilgrim ancestors) and the three-ton Adelphia. They also built three log canoes. This small fleet of boats carried the pioneers down the Youghiogheny River to the Monongahela River, and then to the Ohio River, and onward to the Ohio Country and the Northwest Territory. They arrived at their final destination, the mouth of the Muskingum River at the confluence of the Ohio and Muskingum rivers, on April 7, 1788.Zimmer, True Stories from Pioneer Valley, 14-17. \\"Can too much be said in praise of the noble heroes who opened to settlement the Great Northwest Territory? These men had been trained in army life and discipline and were anxious to take this country as the payment due them for military service. They were men who had fought valiantly to preserve the principles of their government and were ready for other great achievements. They were men who had assisted in making this territory a part of the United States and had, in great measure, assisted in the formation and adoption of the Ordinance of 1787 which was to govern it. Indeed, a better company of men could scarcely have been selected than those who were directed by General Putnam.\\"Summers, History of Marietta, 49-50.

They were certainly the progenitors of the state builders of the great Northwest. Within fifty years of their coming, Ohio had a million and a half of people, and had already made such rapid strides in its internal improvement, its systems of navigation, its jurisprudence, and its enlargement of public education, as to become an example to some of the older states.\\"Kennedy, History of the Ohio Society of New York 1885-1905, 183-84. (A slight correction to this reference: forty- seven persons arrived April 7, 1788, with the forty-eighth person arriving on April 12, 1788.) These early American pioneers to the Northwest Territory have been memorialized in verse and book. The poem, Landing of the Pioneers, was written sixty years after the landing by Frances Dana Gage, and included in her book of poems published in 1867. The poem, The Founders of Ohio, was written in 1888 during the centennial of the event by William Henry Venable, and was published later in several books of poems. The book Pioneer History (1848) by Samuel Prescott Hildreth describes the early civil history of the Northwest Territory in Ohio; Hildreth's book Early Pioneer Settlers of Ohio (1852) provides biographies of the earliest settlers. Many of these early pioneers are buried in Marietta at Mound Cemetery.Hawley, Mound Cemetery, Marietta, Ohio. In 1888, the Adventure Galley III recreated the journey of the original pioneer 'Adventure Galley'. In 1984 this journey was again recreated aboard the Adventure Galley II (actually the fourth boat by the name Adventure Galley), captained by Vaughn P. Wendland. This Adventure Galley IV is on display at the Behringer-Crawford museum in Cincinnati, Ohio.

Morgan and Duane Ashby. Nevada Belle had its workshop premiere in 1998 at the Livery Theatre in Ventura, California. It then went through a long period of rewrites before having its official world premiere at the Petit Theatre in Oxnard, California in 2004.  Background  In the mid-1990s screenwriter and playwright George Morgan was working as an actor on a tourist train in Fillmore, California, playing the detective in a rolling murder mystery dinner theatre. One day the owners of the train asked Morgan if he might consider writing an original musical play to be incorporated into their evening shows. Collaborating with arranger/lyricist Duane Ashby, they created a story about six young women traveling from New York to Virginia City, Nevada in the late 19th century.  Story  Nevada Belle tells the true story of six young women who lived in the 19th century, all of whom ended up working the saloons in Virginia City, Nevada. Though they arrived there at different times, the authors use some license and put all six characters on the same train at the same time. Except for a short opening sequence outside a theatre in New York (where Sarah Bernhardt is performing), the entire story takes place on a steam train as it travels across the United States. The six young women are recruited and watched over by famed Virginia City courtesan Cad Thompson. The play's main character, Rosa May, worked several years for Cad Thompson in Virginia City before eventually settling in Bodie. The show has fifteen Broadway-style tunes.

Evertsz was one of the founding members and leaders of the Antilles National People's Party, which is also known by the abbreviation, NVP. He openly opposed a plan to separate Aruba from the Netherlands Antilles as a separate, autonomous entity within the Kingdom of the Netherlands during his tenure as Prime Minister. Evertsz argued that the removal of Aruba from the Netherlands Antilles would undermine the federation of Dutch islands in the Caribbean. Aruba later seceded from the Netherlands Antilles in 1986, but remained within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

His memoir is Forty-Four Years of the Life of a Hunter (1859). He has been celebrated as Maryland's most famous frontier hunter. Browning's memoir of his \\"hunting-fever\\" years (1795‚Äì1839) and other activities was originally penned with a turkey quill. Half backwoods history, half heroic adventure story, it recounts his hunting expeditions and life-threatening encounters while stalking game and records details of life in early frontier America, western Maryland folkways and early settlement life. Early life Meshach Browning was born in Damascus, Montgomery County, Maryland. Meshach Browning's father was an English soldier who escaped from Braddock's massacre (1755), deserted and settled in the highlands of Western Maryland. This community was a wholly self-subsistent one in which the men wore deer skins procured by their own rifles and dressed and tailored by themselves. The women spun and wove flax and wool. The only commodities upon which they were dependent on outsiders were gunpowder and lead for shot. Meshach Browning married Mary McMullen (1781‚Äì1839) on April 13, 1799 at Blooming Rose, Maryland. After his first wife's death, he married Mary M. Smith, on 24 April 1841 in Allegany County, Maryland. War of 1812 military service His military experience was restricted to a draft as a sergeant in a company of militia, during the War of 1812, which went into action only once, and that on the occasion of a muster when they undertook to ‚Äúlick‚Äù their commander, with whom they had become disgruntled. The mutineers apparently got the worst of it. Hunting career Meshach Browning became an expert in woodcraft and wild animal behavior and habitats. His pursuit of the abundant white-tailed deer, black bear, panthers and wolves through the \\"western wilderness\\" became legendary. This wilderness was the Allegheny Mountains, especially in Garrett County, Maryland and the surrounding regions of what is now West Virginia. He was known as a market hunter. Later years Meshach Browning and his son-in-law, Dominick Mattingly, were selected to collect donations to build a church at Johnstown, Maryland. The result of their labors was St. James Church, dedicated in 1853 under the pastorate of Rev. William Lambert and prosperous for many years. Death Meshach Browning died on November 19, 1859 in Johnstown, Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Legacy In 1859, a book reviewer of Meschach Browning's newly published book noted that his family, founded in 1800, had increased ‚Äúfifty years later to one hundred and twenty-two, of whom sixty- seven, as their progenitor says proudly, were 'capable of bearing arms for the defence of their country,'‚Äî though, to be sure, the Harper's Ferry affair leaves us in some doubt as to the direction in which they would bear them.‚ÄùAnonymous, Atlantic Monthly, Vol. IV, No. 26, December, 1859. Meshach Browning's account of his fight with an unexpectedly formidable buck in the Youghiogheny River inspired Arthur Fitzwilliam Tait (1819-1905) ‚Äî the great Adirondack artist and deer hunter ‚Äî to paint the scene in 1861 (The Life of a Hunter: Catching a Tartar). The same year Currier and Ives published a hand- colored lithograph of Tait's black and white painting, thus immortalizing the incident. A Maryland Historical Marker states Browning was Garrett County's most famous hunter, killing 2,000 deer and 500 bears during this 40-year period. This marker lies within eyesight of Browning's grave at St. Dominic's Catholic Cemetery in Hoye, Maryland. *In 1890, St. James Church was rebuilt under the pastorate of Rev. Romanus Mattingly. The name was changed from to St. Dominic Church (St. Dominic being the patron saint of Dominick Mattingly, who was a zealous Catholic. His wife, Ann Browning, was Meshach's daughter.) The church was located on the road opposite the Mattingly homestead in what is now Hoye, Maryland, and the cemetery adjoining contains the graves of Meshach Browning, D. J. Mattingly, and many of their descendants.
