The resulting costs of the input factors are allocated to the individual products according to a weighting key, the so- called equivalence numbers.  Description  As with the other cost allocation methods, the conservation of the cost sum applies, that is: :\\\\text{sum of cost input} = \\\\text{sum of cost output} The cost of the main product, usually for the product with the highest physical or economical output, receives for example the equivalence number 1. On the basis of selected indicators (average market prices, physical properties, etc.) other equivalence numbers are formed, using suitable ratios between the different co-products. Multiplying the equivalence numbers by the production or sales figures results in the allocation keys for a specific product type. From this the cost of a co-product can be calculated, both for main and by-products.  Application examples  An airline can determine the cost of the transportation service by dividing air freight and passengers by weight. The average passenger weight of booked seats is to be compared to the weight of the loaded air cargo containers. * apass = mpass / (mpass \\\\+ mfreight) * afreight = mfreight / (mpass \\\\+ mfreight) In a refinery, one can assume the input as crude oil and as output gasoline, diesel and heavy fuel oil as well as (flare) losses. The equivalence number method can use the energy content of the products as an allocation key. E is the product of energy density and production quantity. * agas = Egas / (Egas \\\\+ Ediesel \\\\+ EHFO) * adiesel = Ediesel / (Egas \\\\+ Ediesel \\\\+ EHFO) * aHFO = EHFO / (Egas \\\\+ Ediesel \\\\+ EHFO) In the cogeneration plants, the Carnot method allocates the fuel to the products useful heat and electrical work. The weighting key is the exergy content of the output energies. * ael= Œ∑el / (Œ∑el \\\\+ Œ∑c √ó Œ∑th) * ath= (Œ∑c x Œ∑th) / (Œ∑el \\\\+ Œ∑c √ó Œ∑th) In the alternative generation method, the key is thermal and weighted electrical efficiency, where the weighting factor is the ratio of thermal to electrical reference efficiencies (Œ≥ = Œ∑th, ref/Œ∑el,ref). * ael= (Œ≥ Œ∑el) / (Œ≥ Œ∑el \\\\+ Œ∑th) * ath= Œ∑th / (Œ≥ Œ∑el \\\\+ Œ∑th)  Criticism  Criticism of the equivalence number method is justified by the fact that completely arbitrary and random keys can be chosen. For example, in the case of allocating the potable water bill in a house with only one common meter, the water consumption could be divided according to the number of occupants per apartment or the apartment's net dwelling area in m¬≤.  Mathematical background  From a one-dimensional input I, a two-dimensional output is assumed with O1 = f1(I) * I and O2 = f2(I) * I. Note: One interpretation for f is a conversion efficiency from the input to the respective output. More than 2 co-products are also conceivable. The costs k1, k2 are the variable costs of the two outputs which need to be determined. kI represents the known variable costs of the input. Kvar denotes the respective sum of the variable costs. a1 and a2 are the allocation factors for the respective output, i.e. they describe the proportion of the input that is assigned to a co-product. The weighting keys are f1 and f2: :K_1^{var} = a_1 \\\\cdot K_I^{var} = \\\\frac{f_1}{f_1 + f_2} \\\\cdot k_I \\\\cdot I \\\\quad \\\\text{respectively} \\\\quad K_2^{var} = a_2 \\\\cdot K_I^{var} = \\\\frac{f_2}{f_1 + f_2} \\\\cdot k_I \\\\cdot I This results in specific variable costs k1 and k2: :k_1 = \\\\frac{K^{var}_1}{O_1} = \\\\frac{K^{var}_1}{f_1 \\\\cdot I} \\\\quad \\\\text{respectively} \\\\quad k_2 = \\\\frac{K^{var}_2}{O_2} = \\\\frac{K^{var}_2}{f_2 \\\\cdot I} According to the introducing relation of the cost allocation, the following applies: : k_I \\\\cdot I = k_1 \\\\cdot O_1 + k_2 \\\\cdot O_2 \\\\quad \\\\text{or} \\\\quad K_I^{var} = K_1^{var} + K_2^{var}  Further reading  * G√ºnter W√∂he: Einf√ºhrung in die allgemeine Betriebswirtschaftslehre (DE: Introduction in general business economics). 18th edition.

Plan Plans for a new underground line connecting north-west and south-east London via the West End and the City of London were first considered in the 1930s. They were developed during the 1950s and 1960s until a plan for the Fleet line established a route to Lewisham in 1965 with permission to build the first phase to Charing Cross granted in 1969 with the second and third phases approved in 1971 and 1972. Phase 1 opened as the Jubilee line in 1979, but uncertainty as to the appropriate eastern destination of the line and shortage of funds meant that the remaining works were never begun. An alternative route for Phase 3 was planned and approved in 1980 that followed a more northern alignment to Woolwich Arsenal and included St Katharine Docks station. It would have been between Fenchurch Street and Wapping. Although preparatory works were carried out for Phase 2, neither it nor either of the Phase 3 routes were constructed. When, in the 1990s, the Jubilee line extension to Stratford was constructed, it followed a route south of the River Thames.

The film explores the tense emotions, non-conformity and self-expression of teenagers in high school, and the exuberance of first love. The film is directed by Julia Hart, produced by Kristin Hahn, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, Lee Stollman and Jordan Horowitz from a screenplay written by Hahn, Hart and Horowitz, and stars Grace VanderWaal and Graham Verchere. The film was released on March 13, 2020.Tracy, Brianne. \\"Grace VanderWaal Says She Has to 'Fight for a Later Curfew' Like Any Other Teen Her Age\\", People, June 28, 2019 The film has received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised Hart's direction and the nostalgic tone. Plot After Leo Borlock's father died, he began to wear a porcupine tie in remembrance of him. At a new school, he was beaten up, and his tie was cut. Since then, on each birthday, he has received a new porcupine tie from an unknown person, but he does not wear them in public. In high school, Leo (Graham Verchere) plays trumpet in the marching band and helps his friend Kevin Singh (Karan Brar), a member of the A.V. club, host an interview show. One day, a free-spirited girl, Stargirl Caraway (Grace VanderWaal), arrives and makes an impression on Leo when she sings \\"Happy Birthday\\" to him on a ukulele in front of the school. Later, while their losing football team, the Mudfrogs, are playing, Stargirl performs a song, \\"Be True to Your School\\", that energizes them, and they almost get their first win. Kevin and Leo invite her onto their show, but she politely declines. Stargirl becomes a good luck charm for the football team when she sings \\"We Got the Beat\\". She begins hanging out with Leo and tries to get him to come out of his shell. Archie (Giancarlo Esposito), the owner of the local paleontologist camp, tells Leo that Stargirl, lives with her single mother and was homeschooled much of her life. She learned about Leo through Archie. Later, Stargirl tries out for the Speech regionals against Kevin and wins with her unusual speech on rats. While anonymously returning a bike to a boy who was in the hospital, Leo mentions the ties, but Stargirl denies any knowledge of it. Stargirl gives a song suggestion to Leo (\\"Thirteen\\") and kisses him for the first time. They begin dating. During the big game, one of the opposing players is severely injured. Stargirl rides with him to the hospital, confusing everyone. Afterward, Leo tells Stargirl that everyone was demoralized and that they lost. The next day, everyone is disappointed with Stargirl. Leo's friends are upset, but forgive him and apologize for being distant with him. Kevin invites Stargirl onto his show so to explain herself. Stargirl reveals that her real name is Susan; she chose Stargirl because everyone is made of stardust. The audience of students turns on her when a student named Hillari (Shelby Simmons) scolds her for inconsiderately returning a bike to her brother, who was permanently injured while riding it. Stargirl runs off in tears. Leo suggests that Stargirl act like everyone else, much to her consternation, but she starts calling herself Susan and wearing clothes like those of her classmates. At the Speech regionals, Leo asks her to the Winter Dance, and she accepts. Stargirl is about to give a speech on internet privacy, but shifts to a speech on flowers, which wins her first place. Although it is the very first trophy won at the school, nobody pays attention to it. Stargirl decides that being Susan betrays her identity. Leo begins to feel awful, but gets encouragement from his mother (Darby Stanchfield) and Kevin. Stargirl sends Leo her collection of records, a record player and an invite for a \\"big surprise\\" at the dance. When Leo arrives, Stargirl reveals her surprise: him singing in front of everyone. Leo reluctantly gets up and performs his and his father's favorite song, \\"Just What I Needed\\", leading everyone to dance in the courtyard. Stargirl apologizes to Hillari and disappears from the party. Leo discovers that Stargirl moved away, but she has influenced the school in a positive way, and they eventually win more trophies. Leo continues to get ties from Stargirl, and Archie reveals that she collected information on the townsfolk to help them. Even after graduating college, Leo never forgets what Stargirl did for him (\\"Give Me Love (Give Me Peace on Earth)\\"). In a post-credits scene, at an unspecified time, Stargirl sings a song to Leo (\\"Today and Tomorrow\\").

The novel was initially adapted by Kristin Hahn who was also set to produce the film. Production companies involved with the film were expected to include Gotham Group and BCDF Pictures, with the latter also financing the film. On February 8, 2018, it was announced that a new iteration of the screenplay had been developed, Hardwicke would be replaced by Julia Hart as the director, and the film would be produced by Walt Disney Pictures. The film would premiere on Disney+, Disney's streaming service that launched in late 2019. The following month, it was confirmed that the production was in the late stages of development, that Hahn's screenplay was still being utilized, and that she would continue to serve as a producer alongside Ellen Goldsmith-Vein and Lee Stollman. Production companies were to include Gotham Group and Hahn's production company Hahnscape Entertainment. By June 2018, Hart had polished Hahn's script with her husband Jordan Horowitz, who also served as an executive producer for the film. =Casting= In 2015, it was announced that the production would star Joey King and Charlie Plummer as Stargirl and Leo, the boy who narrates the story. By June 2018, however, singer Grace VanderWaal had been cast to star, in her debut acting role, as the title character. By August 2018, Graham Verchere had been cast as Leo. By September 2018, Giancarlo Esposito, Karan Brar, Darby Stanchfield, and Maximiliano Hern√°ndez had been cast in supporting roles. =Filming= Filming was originally scheduled to commence in the fall of 2015 in New Mexico. Principal photography was delayed, however, until September 2018 in New Mexico and wrapped on November 16, 2018. Filming locations in the state included Albuquerque and Truth or Consequences. Release Stargirl was released in the United States on March 13, 2020, by Disney+.  Reception  On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 71%, based on 35 reviews, with an average rating of 6.36/10; the audience rating was 86% on May 23, 2020. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Stargirls feel-good story hits familiar coming-of-age beats, but self-assured performances and an earnest mission worn proudly make it a tune worth listening to.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 60 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a favorable review. He complimented the performances of both VanderWaal and Verchere and called the movie \\"sweet and smart.\\" Sheila O'Malley from RogerEbert.com gave the film a mixed review. She criticized VanderWaal's performance and complained that numerous aspects of the film, mostly centering around Leo's and Stargirl's relationship, did not make sense. However, she praised the visual appearance of the film as well as its message, giving it two stars out of four. Courtney Howard, in Variety, however, praised the principal performances: \\"[VanderWaal] ropes us into the mystery of her character reveal with heaping amounts of magnetism and grounded authenticity. It‚Äôs no surprise that the music-driven scenes really showcase her power. ... She and Verchere, who‚Äôs a genuinely sweet cross between Jessie Eisenberg and Michael Cera sharing the physicality and vocal tonalities of each, are a remarkable pairing.\\" She also commented that \\"Hart and her collaborators adeptly utilize the textural language of cinema to heighten and underline thematic ties.\\" References External links Category:2020 films Category:2020s musical drama films Category:2020s coming-of-age drama films Category:2020s high school films Category:American films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:American high school films Category:American musical drama films Category:Disney+ original films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films based on young adult literature Category:Films directed by Julia Hart Category:Films scored by Rob Simonsen Category:Films shot in New Mexico Category:Walt Disney Pictures films ","title":"Stargirl (film)"},{"id":"57968058","text":"Eeva Maria Tolppanen (born 24 November 1952) is a Finnish politician, representing the Social Democratic Party in the Parliament of Finland.

Education and early life  The daughter of a bookseller Poul Friis and Marie M√∏ller, she was born in Holstebro, and grew up in Skive, graduating from local school Viborg Katedralskole in 1966. She worked as an au-pair in Paris for a year, becoming interested in geology whilst her brother Henrik was a student in the subject. This inspired her to become an assistant teacher in botany and geology in 1971. In 1975 she earned a Magister's degree in science and in 1980 a Licentiate's degree in science, both from Aarhus University.  Research and career  Her area of interest is the reproductive biology, phylogeny and palaeoecology of flowering plants based on plant reproductive organs from the Cretaceous period. Early on in her career she began research into lignite, being involved in fieldwork in the lignite mines in Central Jutland from 1968-1972. She was interested in the ecology and climate of Denmark in the middle Miocene, writing her Licentiate thesis on the subject. From 1980-1981 she moved to London as a British Council Research Scholar, switching research interests following the co-discovery with Swedish scientist Annie Skarby of rare fossilised flowers from the Cretaceous period. She returned to Aarhus University in 1981, co-publishing a book \\"The Origins of Angiosperms and Their Biological Consequences\\" in 1987. She became the head of palaeobotany at the Swedish Museum of Natural History in Stockholm later that year.

This news infuriated the governor of Porto Praia, Don Antonio de Continto de Laneastie. Don Antonio had intended to have Mulgrave Castle surveyed and condemned in order that he might profit from the disposal of her cargo. Don Antonio incarcerated Ralph and Nichols, put fifty soldiers aboard Phillipa, and declared one of her passengers, a Captain Harrington a prisoner on parole. Eventually the governor relented and permitted the British vessels to leave. Captains Nichols, Ralph, and Harrington, as well as the other passengers on the vessels, signed a letter of protest to Don Antonio, informing him that they would bring the matter up with the \\"Right Hon.

Her crew had been saved and although there was eight feet of water in her hold, most of her cargo would be saved. The ship herself was probably unable to be gotten off.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ6066. A letter dated 20 September reported that Mulgrave Castle was a total wreck. Most of her stores and cargo was expected to be saved. , Ferguson, master, would take the undamaged cargo to its destination; the damaged cargo would be auctioned.Lloyd's List 25 November 1825, ‚Ññ6067.

Homicide The amount of homicide in Taipei has been decreasing for the past 30 years. Even though Taipei is one of the safest cities in the world, there were still 68 homicides in 2017. =Early years= When the KMT came to Taiwan in 1949 after losing the Chinese Civil War, it was not safe to walk on the streets of Taipei. In 1989, a soldier shot his girlfriend with a rifle because he thought she was cheating on him. He shot his girlfriend, her colleague, and himself. Although the police came to the scene promptly and sent the three to the hospital, none of them survived. On April 28, 1992, the employee of a McDonald's in Taipei received a bomb threat over the telephone. The bomber demanded six million TWD for ransom. Later that day, a TNT was found in a McDonald's restroom. Unfortunately, the TNT exploded while the police were trying to defuse it. =Present= After the Taiwan McDonald's bombings, the government made great efforts to reduce homicide. The year after the bombing, there were 196 homicides in Taipei. The number decreased over the years and dropped to 68 in 2017. On May 21, 2014, 2014 Taipei Metro attack happened at Jiangzicui Station, resulted in 4 deaths and 24 injuries.

Her professional career ran from 1850 to 1888 under the last name Isma√´l, which was her husband Jean-Vital Jammes' stage name, and she would keep the stage name even after their divorce in 1860. Throughout her onstage roles, she mostly portrayed roles of comic old women, \\"du√®gne\\" roles, or \\"Dugazon\\" roles, which were of young mothers and women past youth.  Early life and marriage  Alceste C≈ìuriot was born in 1823 to French tenor singer Paul-Joseph C≈ìuriot and French lyric singer Victoire Marie Fran√ßoise Lestage. Due to their professional careers, Alceste was born in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Around 1850, Paul-Joseph joined the Op√©ra National de Lyon, where his daughter also became a boarder. There, she met the baritone Isma√´l, who joined Lyon in the summer of 1851, and on 24 January 1852, she married him in the Guilloti√®re neighborhood of Lyon. They continued their careers as a couple ‚Äì first at Lyon, next at the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux, and finally at the Op√©ra de Marseille in 1854. However, from 1854 on, their marriage was troubled, and C≈ìuriot asked for and obtained a separation in 1860 at the expense of Isma√´l. As early as the first half of 1856, C≈ìuriot no longer appeared on the attendance lists of the Op√©ra de Marseille next to him.Judgment of \\"separation\\" kept in the departmental archives of the Bouches du Rh√¥ne.

After working in numerous French theaters, she settled in Brussels, at La Monnaie, from 1875 to 1885. She is shown in Jacques Isnardon's paintings of La Monnaie's troupes in 1875-1876, 1878-1879, 1879-1880 and 1884-1885.Isnardon p. 552, 572, 579, 607 Isnardon also specifies her rate of pay during the years of 1877-1878, 1879-1880, and 1880-1881:Isnardon p. 571, 581, 586 500 francs.At that time, Belgian francs were equal in value to French francs; the countries were part of the Latin Union. While she was in Belgium, she could not be found in France by judicial authorities; however, Isma√´l requested a divorce as soon as she returned to the jurisdiction of French law so that he could marry one of his younger students. The divorce was enforced by default in Marseille on 30 March 1885. During the 1885-1886 season, C≈ìuriot performed at the Th√©√¢tre du Capitole in Toulouse, where she found she would be working alongside Isma√´l's second wife, Marie Isma√´l-Garcin. In 1886, they performed together in Faust by Charles Gounod, both still using Isma√´l's name. Her former husband sued her at the civil court of Toulouse; he refused to let C≈ìuriot continue to perform under this name, believing that his position was lawful because of their divorce. At court, C≈ìuriot won a definitive right to perform as \\"Madam Isma√´l\\", which had been her stage name since 1852. Garcin, the second wife, would then be called \\"Isma√´l-Garcin\\".Armand Silvestre, Deux femmes pour un mari in Georges d'Heylli (dir.)

Career Huang joined the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry (SIOC), Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1955. In 1958, he responded to the demand of Chinese defense industry, stopped his established organic natural product research work and pursued research in the field of organofluorine chemistry. Under his leadership, the major base for organofluorine chemistry in China was established at the SIOC. Huang discovered the sulfinatodehalogenation reaction in 1981, which converts perfluoroalkyl halides to the corresponding perfluoroalkanesulfinates with sulfinatodehalogenation reagents such as sodium dithionite. He and his students identified this reaction as a single electron transfer reaction.Qingyun Chen, Chinese J. Chemistry 2011, 29, 2567 This reaction opens a new and practical way for perfluoroalkylation of unsaturated substrates such as alkenes alkynes and aromatics compounds with sulfinatodehalogenation reagents.

The game was first released in the Americas and Europe on July 12, 2018, for the Nintendo Switch game console through the Nintendo eShop download service, followed by versions for PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, and macOS. Set in a Latin American jungle, the player controls a chicken who can lay multiple bombs, which are used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies in order to escape a processing plant run by BFC, a large fast-food chain. Bomb Chicken was well received by critics, who praised its gameplay and presentation, but criticized its short length. Gameplay The player character, the chicken, can lay multiple bombs in a stack to ascend. Should the green, armored enemy at the bottom touch the stack, all the bombs will explode in a chain reaction. The enemy on the top platform guards the blue gems that surround it. Bomb Chicken is a 2D puzzle-platformer where the player controls a chicken who can lay bombs instead of eggs. The chicken obtained this power after an accident involving the mysterious blue sauce that is being mined by BFC, a large fast- food chain. Unlike in most platformers, the chicken cannot jump; instead, it ascends by laying bombs which it stands on top of. The chicken can lay multiple bombs in a stack in order to reach higher places. The bombs automatically explode a few seconds after laying them, so the chicken must move quickly after laying them. Bombs can be pushed by the chicken so that they fly into enemies and obstacles. The chicken uses these abilities to try to escape BFC's mining operation, with settings including a factory and overgrown Mesoamerican ruins. The chicken faces several foes, ranging from BFC workers to aggressive natives, most of which can be defeated by using a bomb or landing on top of them. Obstacles include blocks which can be blown up, flying arrows, platforms that fall when the chicken steps on them, and fireballs that hop out of lava. Switches are a common puzzle element and can be pressed to open mechanical doors. Some of them are on a timer, while others only stay active if something stays on top of them. Certain doors are also opened by taking keycards to them. The game has a total of 29 levels spread across three worlds. The chicken dies after taking one hit, after which it loses a life, which only replenishes after clearing a level or getting a game over, which happens when the chicken loses all its lives. Within the levels are blue gems that the chicken can collect, as well as hidden rooms which house even more gems. Between each level is an opportunity to trade a certain number gems to increase the player's maximum extra lives. With each trade, the threshold for gems increases, so the player will have to collect more gems across multiple levels in order to meet this minimum requirement. Development Bomb Chicken was developed by UK-based studio Nitrome, which had previously exclusively made browser games and mobile games. The game was first announced on March 16, 2017, via a teaser on YouTube and was posted to Steam Greenlight the same day. The game was originally scheduled for release in 2017, but was later delayed to 2018. On March 20, 2018, Nitrome confirmed the game would launch first on Nintendo Switch, marking their first console game. A Japanese release was also announced, and the game released there on November 1, 2018. Nitrome has also said that they are open to downloadable content should the game sell well enough, as well as a physical release. A physical release for Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 was released on March 29, 2019, courtesy of Limited Run Games. The game was announced for download on PlayStation 4 and Steam for April 16, 2019. Reception Bomb Chicken received positive reviews from critics.

It is located on the border of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park. It's situated midway between Black Peak and Fisher Peak, and can be seen from the North Cascades Highway. Precipitation runoff from Repulse Peak drains into tributaries of the Skagit River and Stehekin River. Climate Repulse Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Repulse Peak is between Black Peak (left) and Fisher Peak (center) as seen from the Pacific Crest Trail above Swamp Creek The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Background  The Venice Biennale is an international art biennial exhibition held in Venice, Italy. Often described as \\"the Olympics of the art world\\", the Biennale is a prestigious event for contemporary artists known for propelling career visibility. The festival has become a constellation of shows: a central exhibition curated by that year's artistic director, national pavilions hosted by individual nations, and independent exhibitions throughout Venice. The Biennale parent organization also hosts regular festivals in other arts: architecture, dance, film, music, and theater. Outside of the central, international exhibition, individual nations produce their own shows, known as pavilions, as their national representation. Nations that own their pavilion buildings, such as the 30 housed on the Giardini, are responsible for their own upkeep and construction costs as well. Nations without dedicated buildings create pavilions in venues throughout the city.  Organization and building  The pavilion was built in 1912 and designed by architect Faust Finzi, chief engineer for the Venice municipality. Its layout and details are similar to that of the German pavilion, whose architect was Finzi's former boss.

Plan Plans for a new underground line connecting north-west and south-east London via the West End and the City of London were first considered in the 1930s. They were developed during the 1950s and 1960s until a plan for the Fleet line established a route to Lewisham in 1965 with permission to build the first phase to Charing Cross granted in 1969 with the second and third phases approved in 1971 and 1972. Phase 1 opened as the Jubilee line in 1979, but uncertainty as to the appropriate eastern destination of the line and shortage of funds meant that the remaining works were never begun. An alternative route for Phase 3 was planned and approved in 1980 that followed a more northern alignment to Woolwich Arsenal with a branch from Custom House to Beckton. The line from Custom House would have followed the disused route of the Great Eastern Railway's Beckton branch. Although preparatory works were carried out for Phase 2, neither it nor either of the Phase 3 routes were constructed.

Zolinsky studied at the City College of New York (now often known as \\"CCNY\\") in the early 1920s. In early June 1923, Zolinsky interrupted his college studies to sail by ship with friend Meyer Schapiro for Rotterdam and a tour of Europe. In later June, Whittaker Chambers sailed over to Bremerhaven; the three met in Berlin and traveled together. Career John Saxton Sumner (1915) went after Samuel Roth but wound up arresting Henry Zolinsky instead At City College, Zolinsky was an editor of The Lavender, student poetry magazine. His circle of friends extended to other student poets and writers, including many from Columbia University like Louis Zukofsky, Whittaker Chambers, Meyer Schapiro, and Samuel Roth. He published Zukofsky in The Lavender. In 1929, Henry Zolinsky was working for the bookstore of Samuel Roth in New York City. On October 4, 1929, John Saxton Sumner, head of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice or \\"NYSVV\\" (chartered by the New York State Legislature), raided a warehouse of the Golden Hind Press (owned by Samuel Roth) in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

The game runs on a freemium model, and is supported through the use of microtransactions. The game's trailer is narrated by American Star Trek actor, Jeffrey Combs. The premise of the game is simple; players must choose one of three warring factions to battle against one another for supremacy within the Maelstrom Galaxy (the game's main fictional location). In the heat of the battle, all three factions must also face off against a common threat, known as the Imperium. Players begin by picking which faction they would like to be a part of. There are three factions. The Tyrannar Empire, The Sovereignty, and The Intergalactic Alliance. Whichever decision the player makes, will ultimately effect the way the rest of their game-play looks, feels, and functions. Each player has their own starbase, and fleets they have to upgrade in order to defend themselves from other players, or even attack other players and non-player characters (NPCs). Players can earn experience points and level up by upgrading their fleets and starbase, completing game missions, and engaging in live combat with other players and NPCs.

He was a pioneer in the development of astronomical photometry: the first-ever celestial photometric measurements were made using photovoltaic cells that he developed for the purpose. He invented the absolute sine-electrometer and was a prolific author of mathematical and scientific textbooks and papers. Early life and family He was born George Minchin Smith on 25 May 1845 on Valentia Island, Co.Kerry, Ireland to George Smith and Alice Minchin.Baptisms in the Parish of Kilmore on Valentia in the County of Kerry in the year 1845 His mother died when he was nine years old. His father, an attorney who lived in Donnybrook, Dublin, placed him into the care of his uncle (by marriage) on his mother's side, David Bell. A literary scholar, Bell ran a school in Dublin and was uncle to another pupil at the school, one Alexander Graham Bell. Minchin's notable mathematical ability was encouraged. He entered Trinity College, Dublin in 1862, matriculating under the name George Minchin Smith, and won the first university scholarship in mathematics in 1865, and the Lloyd exhibition in mathematics. In 1866, he graduated, still as G. M. Smith, with a Gold Medal in mathematics. By then he had assumed the name George Minchin Minchin, receiving his MA in 1870, under the new name, and then Madden's Premium in both 1871 and 1872 for his performance in the Fellowship examinations. The Smiths were a Protestant family. George Minchin Smith changed his name to George Minchin Minchin evidently because his father had converted to Roman Catholicism and married a Catholic, Marie O‚ÄôNeill, possibly his housekeeper, with whom he already had three children. https://www.genealogy.com/ftm/g/r/a/John-T-Grady- MA/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0215.html In 1887 Minchin married Emma Fawcett of Lecarrow (or Strandhill), Co. Leitrim. They had two children, George Robert Neville in 1888 and Una Eleanor in 1890. [George junior became an engineer and later the managing director of Peto & Radford (accumulator manufacturers) and the Chloride battery company.] This electrometer type was invented by George Minchin and developed by others, in this case the tilted gold-leaf electrometer of Charles Thomas Rees Wilson and George William Clarkson Kaye, marketed by Cambridge Scientific Instruments. Career In 1875 Minchin became the Professor of Applied Mathematics at the Royal Indian Engineering College (aka Coopers Hill or R.I.E. College) on the outskirts of London, and the same year he was elected to the London Mathematical Society. As a lecturer at RIEC, he was described as \\"brilliant\\", much admired for his wit and ability to draw in pupils and colleagues alike with otherwise dull topics. He maintained a regular correspondence, particularly with George Francis FitzGerald. Minchin wrote many mathematical and scientific texts and his clarity of exposition was lauded; he wrote and lectured about the importance of using clear English when producing texts for students. He also encouraged using \\"a touch of humour,\\" citing the work of George Salmon and James Clerk Maxwell as exemplars. He wrote humorous works including comical mathematical poems. He has been credited with introducing the term 'potential function' with reference to applications in physics and engineering, but George Green had in fact done so as early as 1828. He was noted for being one of the College's best tennis players (he had also been a cricketer). He loved birds and birdwatching and kept a few in cages in his rooms. Minchin performed early experiments with radio waves, x-rays and photoelectricity, both at RIEC and University College London (in the latter at the new laboratory of George Carey Foster, from 1875). Experiments included coating platinum with light-sensitive dyes, a technique he developed until he was able to detect \\"Hertzian waves\\" (radio waves) in his \\"impulsion cell\\", and he suspected that the Branly's tube with iron filings which detected the waves operated similarly. The sensitivity of Minchin's photo-electric cell apparatus was tested through a number of thick walls and outside as far as the woods at the edge of the RIEC lawn. A light switch was successfully operated remotely. Oliver Lodge read Minchin's paper, The Action of Electromagnetic Radiation on Films containing Metallic Powders, and developed an improved 'Branly' tube that he named a coherer. In his publication Signalling Across Space Without Wires, Lodge tabled Branly's filings, Minchins impulsion cell and his own (and David Edward Hughes's) coherer as \\"microphonic\\" radiation detectors (the others being mechanical, electrical, thermal, chemical and physiological). One year later Guglielmo Marconi demonstrated wireless telegraphy with the usage of a coherer. In 1877, Minchin began work on using photoelectricity with a view to transmitting images. Four years earlier, Willoughby Smith had discovered the photoelectric effect on selenium rods; Minchin became skilled at creating photovoltaic cells made from selenium. His idea was to have a bundle of many insulated wires in parallel, their ends light-sensitised with selenium to detect an image, and for the far ends to emit a proportional level of light registered by a photographic film, effectively as pixels. The efforts were unsuccessful. Continuing his work, Minchin developed a selenium photocathode on an aluminium base which was immersed in acetone. He complained that some scientists rejected the worthiness of experimentation with photoelectricity out of ignorance, a situation he described as \\"madness.\\" He was the most insightful of 19th century experimenters in suggesting that photocells transformed energy without being changed themselves. He also made the key point that one should not assume surfaces need to be black to absorb usefully the most energy and that undiscovered surface properties might absorb visible light or other unknown wavelengths better, so scientists could not comment on the efficacy of light-sensitive cells without further scientific testing. These posited differences in energy were in fact later identified through the work of Max Planck and Albert Einstein. Keen to test his new cells, in late 1891 Minchin contacted a friend ‚Äî William Monck ‚Äì who had built an observatory with a 7.5 inch (19 cm) refractor at his home in Earlsfort Terrace, Dublin. For the experiment, Monck ordered a new quadrant electrometer after FitzGerald was unable to provide a suitable one. The following August, Minchin provided Monck with improved cells but returned to England because of bad weather. More clement conditions on the morning of 28 August enabled Monck and his neighbour Stephen Dixon to measure the \\"striking\\" effect of the Moon and the relative brightness of Venus and Jupiter, the first photometric measurements in the history of astronomy. The measurements of stars were uncertain, however. Minchin met William Wilson in London and the latter invited him to try his cells at the new observatory at his home, Daramona House, Co.Westmeath. In April 1895, Wilson and Minchin operated the 2-foot (60 cm) reflector, and FitzGerald the galvanometer below. Minchin published the results of a few days' observations in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, describing the relative magnitudes of the stars Regulus, Arcturus and Procyon, and acknowledging Monck's measurements. It is believed he visited Wilson's home in 1894 and 1897, and he certainly did in September 1895 and January 1896, but no other observations were recorded. Minchin invented a metrological device, the absolute sine-electrometer, a very sensitive development of the gold-leaf electroscope; this device was further developed and marketed as a 'tilted gold-leaf electrometer' by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument Company, amongst others. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1895. He resisted his colleagues' and students' entreaties to scale up his experiments to create something of practical usage, preferring his work to be considered as purely for learning. RIEC closed in 1906 and he moved to New College, Oxford because of its laboratories and telescopes. He died on 23 March 1914, survived by his wife and children.

History  The earliest record of a mixed Indo-Maori union is said to have occurred in 1810, when an Indian man from Bengal abandoned a shipping vessel to marry a MƒÅori woman. There is also record of an Indian man living with his MƒÅori wife in the Bay of Islands in 1815; another took up residence on Stewart Island after 1814. Possibly the earliest non-MƒÅori settlers of the Otago region of South Island were three Indian lascars who deserted ship to live among the Maori in 1813. There, they assisted the NgƒÅi Tahu by passing on new skills and technologies, including how to attack colonial European vessels in the rain when their guns could not be fired. They integrated into MƒÅori culture completely, participating in TƒÅ moko and taking on MƒÅori names. The late 1800s and early 1900s saw the first wave of migration of Indian men and later women arriving to the country. A number of them came directly to New Zealand but some came via Fiji and others via other British colonies such as Burma. In the earliest group of Indian pioneer men were those who came to New Zealand as teenagers. These young men from Punjab and Gujarat were generally looked after by the MƒÅori community, and tended to have unions with MƒÅori women. Children of these unions were often cast out by the wider Indian community. However, such children continued to be welcomed into the MƒÅori community. Of the 3,151 Indians recorded on the 1951 census of New Zealand - 253 were of MƒÅori Indian origin. In 10 years, by the 1961 census, there were just slightly more Indians in New Zealand, while the number of MƒÅori Indians had risen dramatically to 454. In Te Arawa the most well-known whanau of Indo-Maori descent are the Bhana whanau from Ngati Whakaue. = 21st Century = Responses to the 2001 New Zealand Census indicated that 1.5% of Indian women and 2% of Indian men in New Zealand were in inter-ethnic unions with a MƒÅori partner. About 18% of children of these unions can converse in the Maori language, while less than 10% could speak an Indian language. The first hui (MƒÅori assembly) for people of mixed MƒÅori and Indian descent was held in 2012 in Rotorua. A second assembly was held in 2014, with over 200 mixed Maori Indians in attendance.

By the time of the US entry into World War II, the 3-inch M3 was in the process of being replaced and may have seen action in the Pacific during World War II. History During the late 1920s, M1917 and M1918 guns were fitted with removable barrel liners and re-designated as 3-inch M1, M2, or M3 guns, depending on the variant they were upgraded from. The most numerous variant was the M3 which was introduced in 1928 and consisted of a new barrel with a removable autofretted liner. During the 1930s further upgrades were proposed but these were abandoned with the adoption of the 90 mm gun M1 in 1938. Design The M3 consisted of a barrel 50 calibers in length, which had a removable liner and a semi-automatic vertical sliding- wedge breech. The barrel had a hydro-pneumatic recoil system and when fired the breech ejected the shell casing and remained open until a new round was loaded. The M2A2 cruciform carriage had a circular center section and four perforated steel outriggers for stability. For transport, the outriggers folded and a two-wheeled, single axle bogie could be screwed onto the outriggers at each end. The carriage had pneumatic tires, electric brakes and was capable of being towed at high speeds. The gun was provided with a set of equilibrators and was capable of both high angle fire +80¬∞ and 360¬∞ of traverse. Anti-tank gun In September 1940 a project started to adapt the 3-inch gun to the anti-tank role, starting with the T9 experimental model but equipping it with the breech, recoil system and carriage borrowed from the 105mm M2 howitzer. The gun was accepted for service as the 3-inch M5. A similar derivative of the T9 ‚Äì the 3-inch M6 ‚Äì was intended to be mounted on the M5 self-propelled gun, which was eventually abandoned. A final adaptation was the 3-inch M7, which included minor modifications for mounting on the M6 heavy tank and M10 tank destroyer. The M7 saw wide use although it was supplanted to some extent by more powerful weapons such as the 90mm M3 and the British QF 17 pounder. A total of 6,824 M7 guns were manufactured. Ammunition The M3 fired a Fixed QF 76.2 √ó 585R round and a number of different styles of ammunition were available: * Armor-piercing * Armor- piercing capped * High explosive Photo gallery File:3inchUSM1918AAGunAutoTrailerTravelingPosition.jpgThe predecessor of the M3; the M1918 in traveling position.

He is part of a clan that heads a CJNG money laundering branch known as Los Cuinis. Since 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia reportedly held a leading role within the CJNG as the security chief of Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the criminal group. Security forces in the U.S. and Mexico suspect he was also responsible for coordinating drug trafficking operations from Mexico to the U.S., Asia, and Europe. As the Mexican government crackdown on the CJNG, Gonz√°lez Valencia fled to Bolivia in September 2015 using a Mexican passport with a fake name. Bolivian officials were not able to decipher his real identity because his alias was not on the Interpol watch-list and his passport had all international security features in place. He lived in Bolivia for two years, obtained a Bolivian foreigner ID card, and was granted temporary residency. In December 2017, he flew to Brazil to spend time with his family during Christmas and was arrested by the Federal Police. Brazilian authorities confirmed that the arrest was part of a request from the U.S. government for his extradition. Early life and background Jos√© Gonz√°lez Valencia, also known by his alias \\"El Chepa\\", \\"Camar√≥n\\" (English: Shrimp), and \\"Santy\\", was born in Mexico. Other sources cite his real name as Jos√© Mar√≠a Gonz√°lez Valencia and his alias \\"El Chema\\". According to his Bolivian ID card that was issued to him under the fake name Jafett Arias Becerra, he was born on 18 May 1975. His parents were J. Abigael Gonz√°lez Mendoza (father) and Estela Valencia Far√≠as (mother). According to the Mexican government, the Gonz√°lez Valencia clan was made up of 18 siblings. The males are Abigael, Jos√© Mar√≠a, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, √âdgar Ed√©n, Mauricio, Gerardo, Jos√© and Luis √Ångel. The females are Rosalinda (also known as Rosal√≠a), Noem√≠, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, Mar√≠a Elena, √ârika and Abiga√≠l. People in their hometown nicknamed the clan \\"Cuinis\\" in reference to a squirrel (spermophilus adocetus) from the area that is known as \\"Cuinique\\". It is common for this squirrel to have over a dozen babies each time the mother gives birth. Several of his siblings have been suspected of working for the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a criminal group based in Jalisco, and its allied branch known as Los Cuinis. His family's involvement in the drug trade dates back to Armando Valencia Cornelio (alias \\"El Maradona\\"), who founded the Milenio Cartel in the 1970s in Michoac√°n and Guerrero. His family, including Gonz√°lez Valencia and his siblings, continued the family business for the following years.  Criminal career in Mexico  On 1 August 2005, Gonz√°lez Valencia and his siblings Abigael and √âdgar were nearly killed in an attack carried out by a group of armed men in a cockfighting arena in Tonal√°, Jalisco. Armed men stormed the arena and attacked the spectators with AK-47 assault rifles and grenades. Four people were killed and twenty-eight more were injured, including Gonz√°lez Valencia (who was shot in the arm) and Antonio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"Tony Montana), a suspected high-ranking member of the CJNG. Among those killed was Sa√∫l D√≠az Oseguera (alias \\"El Cangrejo\\"), allied to Gonz√°lez Valencia. When security forces arrived at the scene, they discovered that several of the cockfighting attendees were also in possession of assault rifles and bullet-proof vehicles. However, the Government of Jalisco did not make any arrests at the scene since they did not consider it necessary to arrest the victims of the attack. In Mexico, Gonz√°lez Valencia had several open criminal investigations against him in multiple states. In Jalisco, he had a pending arrest warrant in a civil court for a homicide charge. Mexican prosecutors believe he was behind the murder of Jes√∫s √Ålvarez Gallegos, Jalisco's Secretary of Tourism, in Zapopan on 9 March 2013. According to Jonathan Garc√≠a Garc√≠a's (alias \\"John Perro\\") confession, the alleged assassin, it was Gonz√°lez Valencia who ordered the murder directly to him from his in-law Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias \\"El Mencho\\"), the top leader of the CJNG. The reason for the murder, John Perro claimed, was because the CJNG believed he was laundering money on behalf of the Knights Templar Cartel, a rival gang of the CJNG. The murder instructions from Gonz√°lez Valencia stated that √Ålvarez Gallegos should not be alive past the weekend; he was killed on a Saturday as he was leaving a meeting with the Governor of Jalisco. Mexican authorities suspect that Gonz√°lez Valencia played a key role in the CJNG during his time in Mexico. They believe he was the security chief of El Mencho in 2015. He is also accused of leading the CJNG's expansion in Mexico over the drug territories once controlled by the Knights Templar Cartel in Michoac√°n. The Attorney General of Mexico (PGR) suspects that when his brother Abigael (alias \\"El Cuini\\") was arrested in Mexico in 2015, he reportedly took control of his CJNG tasks, and led multiple attacks against security forces in Jalisco during his tenure. Later that year, he fled Mexico and settled in Bolivia. According to the Center for Research and National Security (CISEN), Mexico's intelligence agency, Gonz√°lez Valencia headed the financial operations of the CJNG and managed the group's alliances with other criminal networks in Asia and Europe, where the CJNG sends narcotics from Mexico. In addition, the CISEN alleged that Gonz√°lez Valencia managed the relationship with arms traffickers in the United States and Central America. One of his closest business partners within the CJNG was a man named Rogelio Gu√≠zar Camorlinga (alias \\"El Doctor\\") from Michoac√°n. Security force allege that El Doctor was responsible for killing rival gangsters of the CJNG and police officers who oppose them. El Doctor was originally a medic in Michoac√°n that turned to organized crime by allying himself with other CJNG members who were originally from his home state. = Residence in Bolivia = In September 2015, Gonz√°lez Valencia flew into Santa Cruz de la Sierra in Bolivia from Lima, Peru. He entered using a Mexican passport with the fake name Jafett Arias Becerra. According to Bolivia's General Directorate of Migration (DIGEMIG), Gonz√°lez Valencia's passport was official and had all the international security features in place. The passport was certified by the DIGEMIG upon his arrival in the country, but they later clarified after Gonz√°lez Valencia was arrested that they were not aware that the information in the passport was false. They stated his Mexican passport was issued in 2013 and expired in 2023. With his Mexican passport, the DIGEMIG explained, Gonz√°lez Valencia was able to apply for one-year temporary residency in Bolivia and get a foreigner ID card from the General Service of Personal Identification (SEGIP). He was able to get temporary residency through a Bolivian national who Gonz√°lez Valencia was close to and who agreed to be responsible for his financial support. On 22 March 2017, Gonz√°lez Valencia started an application to extend his one-year temporary residency to a two-year one that included work eligibility. He applied to this application using his alias, and issued a work petition form to the city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra through a law firm. His two-year residency was later approved. The DIGEMIG explained to the press that Gonz√°lez Valencia was also able to enter the country because the Interpol had not issued a red alert against the name Jafett Arias Becerra, which Gonz√°lez Valencia used to enter the country and apply for residency. The Bolivian government argued that they did not have enough information to investigate Gonz√°lez Valencia's background because of the lack of information on foreign criminals. Henry Baldelomar, head of the DIGEMIG in Santa Cruz, stated that this incident was the Mexican government's fault because they were the ones who initially gave Gonz√°lez Valencia a passport with a fake name. With his fake name, Gonz√°lez Valencia lived in Bolivia for two years. Faustino Alfonso Mendoza Arce, the police commander of the National Police of Bolivia, said the police would investigate who were responsible for giving Gonz√°lez Valencia a Bolivian foreigner ID card and his temporary residency. The swiftness in how Gonz√°lez Valencia obtained his foreigner ID card raised suspicions because the application process usually takes between one and three years and requires legal residency. The process also includes a background check in the applicant's home country, which meant that if done correctly, Gonz√°lez Valencia's drug trafficking allegations would have been uncovered. The DIGEMIG stated the issuing of the ID card was not plagued with irregularities because Gonz√°lez Valencia was not wanted by the INTERPOL and had a work sponsor. Politicians, however, asked the Minister of Government (es) Carlos Romero to open up an investigation towards the DIGEMIG and the police for issuing the ID card to Gonz√°lez Valencia. They highlighted that six months prior to this incident, the CJNG had reportedly laundered money at the Asociaci√≥n Cruce√±a de F√∫tbol (es), a Bolivian football league based out of Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where Gonz√°lez Valencia did his residency application. Arrest in Brazil On 27 December 2017, Gonz√°lez Valencia was arrested by Brazilian authorities outside a beach resort area in Aquiraz, Cear√°. Security forces were tracking his footsteps since he arrived in Brazil from the Pinto Martins ‚Äì Fortaleza International Airport as a tourist on 22 December with a Bolivian foreigner ID card with a fake name, Jafett Arias Becerra. This entire surveillance that led to his arrest was coordinated from the Federal Police's main headquarters in Bras√≠lia. According to the Brazilian police, they discovered he was in Brazil immediately upon landing when he checked-in, but decided not to approach him at the airport and instead followed him to where he was going. The police checked in their security system to retrieve information from him, and also looked into hotel registration lists and rental car companies to track his movements in Brazil. He was vacationing in Brazil for Christmas holidays with his family and rented a beach house in Ta√≠ba beach. The houses he rented were done through a strawperson. Gonz√°lez Valencia traveled alone from Bolivia and was meeting his family in Brazil. In Brazil, he was accompanied by his wife, their child, and some friends. According to the police, he was planning to stay in Brazil until 3 January. When the police surrounded him in the resort area, he did not resist arrest. He was sent to the headquarters of the Federal Police of Brazil in Fortaleza, Cear√°, where officials later confirmed that there was a pending arrest warrant and extradition request against him from the United States. None of the people who were with him at the moment of his arrest were apprehended by the police because there were no arrest warrants against them. According to the Supreme Federal Court (STF), Brazil's highest court system, the request from the U.S. authorities was made because of Gonz√°lez Valencia's alleged participation in drug trafficking in Mexico and the U.S as a member of the CJNG. Bolivian authorities stated they would work with Brazil to exchange information and coordinate on the case involving Gonz√°lez Valencia. Mexican authorities did not release an official statement on Gonz√°lez Valencia's arrest when the news was made public in Brazil. Upon further investigation, Brazilian authorities confirmed that Gonz√°lez Valencia had visited Brazil three times with his assumed alias. They said that he was not in Brazil to commit illegal activities and that he would visit for leisure and did not have Brazilian friends. The first time he visited was in 2015, the same year he fled Mexico to avoid prosecution. The arrest of Gonz√°lez Valencia demonstrated the international expansion of the CJNG and Los Cuinis outside of Mexico, and highlighted international cooperation among U.S., Mexico, and South American security forces. Law enforcement officials believe that the CJNG and Los Cuinis were trying to expand their presence in South America to avoid the pressure they were facing in Mexico. In Mexico, where the CJNG and Los Cuinis have a larger presence, the government has led multiple crackdowns that resulted in the arrest of several high-ranking members of both criminal groups. The United States had also imposed economic sanctions and filed charges against the groups and several of their leaders in federal courts. In addition, Brazil is considered an attractive money laundering center for criminal groups, which meant that the Gonz√°lez Valencia family was probably looking for business opportunities there. This incident was not the first time the Gonz√°lez Valencia clan held operations in South America; in July 2016, Gonz√°lez Valencia's brother Gerardo was arrested in Uruguay for money laundering and drug trafficking charges. = Extradition process = On 23 January 2018, the STF rejected a motion to carry out extradition process against Gonz√°lez Valencia in secret. Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense wanted the process to be held in secrecy to protect their client and his family, given the fact that the arrest garnered national attention. However, STF judge Carmen Lucia Antunes said they would not make an exception for them because publicity was part of the judicial process. The STF also rejected a motion from Gonz√°lez Valencia's defense and the Federal Police, which requested the court to allow Gonz√°lez Valencia to be transferred to another prison closer to where his extradition hearings were held. The Federal Police and the defense argued that the prison Gonz√°lez Valencia was held at had multiple deficiencies, but the STF responded to the allegations by claiming that no evidence for such claims was presented to them. On 12 February 2018, Gonz√°lez Valencia issued a writ of amparo requesting his extradition, and criticized the Mexican government for not requesting his extradition to Mexico. The request was received by an appeals court based in Mexico City. Judge Jorge Antonio Medina Gaona requested federal authorities to release information on the process they have carried out to try to get Gonz√°lez Valencia, a Mexican national, to Mexico. The court hearing was pushed multiple times because the appeals court requested this information from multiple federal agencies, including the Legal Counsel of the Federal Executive (CJEF) (es) and the Secretariat of Foreign Affairs (SRE). The SRE politicians who were specifically mentioned in the writ of amparo were M√≥nica Mar√≠a Antonieta Velarde M√©ndez, Luis Videgaray Caso, Carlos Alberto de Icaza Gonz√°lez (es), and Carlos Manuel Sada Solana (es). On 5 March 2018, the STF minister Jos√© Celso de Mello Filho agreed to transfer Gonz√°lez Valencia to the Federal Penitentiary of Mossor√≥ (pt) from the Regional Superintendence of the Federal Police in Cear√°. When the request was initially denied months prior, the Federal Police asked the STF to reconsider the application. The STF looked at the evidence presented and approved the transfer after considering that the federal penitentiary had better security measures, especially during night time, and that there was vacancy for him. On 16 October 2018, the United States Department of State, Justice, and Treasury announced a joint law enforcement measure against the CJNG, and publicized previously sealed indictments from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia accusing Gonz√°lez Valencia of being involved in international drug trafficking. Through the Narcotics Rewards Program, the U.S. government confirmed they were offering up to US$5 million for information that led to his arrest. According to sealed court files under federal judge Beryl A. Howell, Gonz√°lez Valencia participated in the distribution of 5 kg (11 lb) or more of cocaine from Mexico and elsewhere for illegal importation into the U.S. from 2006 to 2016. If convicted, the indictment stated that Gonz√°lez Valencia would have to forfeit the proceeds he made from the violation. On 11 December 2018, Celso de Mello approved his extradition process.

She is currently Professor of Soil Biogeochemistry and the Ted and Jan Falasco Chair in Earth Sciences and Geology in the Department of Life and Environmental Sciences; University of California, Merced. Her research group works to understand how soil helps regulate the earth's climate.  Education and early career  Asmeret was born and raised in Asmara, Eritrea in northeast Africa bordering the Red Sea. She received her Bachelors of Science in Soil and Water Conservation at the University of Asmara in Eritrea. There, she was one of three women in a 55-person class in the soil science department. She later attended Michigan State University for her Masters in Political Ecology with an emphasis on the effects of land degradation, working to understand how landmines cause land degradation. She then performed her doctoral work at University of California, Berkeley, where she received her PhD in Biogeochemistry in ecologist John Harte's laboratory, where she was also co- advised by Margaret Torn (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and Jennifer Harden (US Geological Survey, Menlo Park). Her graduate work sought to understand how erosion affected the exchange of carbon between the land and the air. She found that erosion can actually cause soil to store more carbon. She continued her postdoctoral research at UC Berkeley with the support of the President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program under the mentorship of Johan Six and Jillian Banfield, and then moved to University of California, Davis to continue her postdoctoral work.  Research  Asmeret's research interests center on the effect of changing environmental conditions‚Äîspecifically fire, erosion, and climate change‚Äîon important soil processes. Her group is working to understand how perturbations in the environment affect how essential elements like carbon and nitrogen cycle through the soil system. One of her group's projects is to understand how drought and wildfire affect soil's ability to store carbon, taking her out to Yosemite National Park and the Sierra Nevada for fieldwork. Given the prevalence of drought in California, this work is of particular public importance, and as a result, has been highlighted by public figures like California Congressman Jerry McNerney (D-CA 9th District). Her research extends to political ecology, working to understand the contribution of armed conflict to land degradation and how people interact with their environment. She has co-authored a review taking stock of the relationship between global change, soil, and human security (including food security and water quality) in the 21st century, citing possible interventions and solutions for sustainable soil management. Asmeret's work has garnered support from a number of funding sources, including the National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the University of California President's Research Catalyst Awards, the United States Department of Energy, and more.  Advocacy and global impact work  Asmeret's work at the intersection of soil, climate change, and political ecology lends itself well to a number of global issues. During her graduate career, she was a member of the working group that produced the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which was called for by the United Nations Secretary Kofi Annan to assess the impact of humans on the environment. She was one of the lead authors on the 2005 report's chapter on \\"Drivers of Change in Ecosystem Condition and Services.\\" The Assessment received the Zayed International Prize for the Environment in 2005. In 2018, Asmeret was selected as part of the inaugural National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine New Voices in Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine cohort, as an early career leader working to advance the conversation around key emerging global issues and communicate the evidence base around those challenges. An advocate for women in science, Berhe is currently a co-Principal Investigator of ADVANCEGeo, which is working to transform the workplace climate of the geosciences to increase retention of women in the field and develop a sustainable model that can be transferred to other scientific domains.

Estradiol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production in both women and men. Estradiol differs from non- bioidentical estrogens like conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol in various ways, with implications for tolerability and safety. Estradiol can be taken by mouth, held under the tongue, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle or fat, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes. Mechanism of action Estradiol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the nuclear estrogen receptors (ERs), the estrogen receptor alpha (ERŒ±) and the estrogen receptor beta (ERŒ≤). In one study, the value of estradiol for the human ERŒ± was 50 pM (0.05 nM) and for the human ERŒ≤ was 200 pM (0.2 nM). Estradiol is also an agonist of the membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), including the G protein- coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (3‚Äì6 nM), Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor (Gq-mER), ER-X, and ERx. It is far more potent as an estrogen than are other natural and bioidentical estrogens like estrone and estriol. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. In addition, much of the estrogenic potency of estrone in vivo is actually due to conversion into estradiol. Estradiol has little to no affinity for other steroid hormone receptors, including the androgen, progesterone, glucocorticoid, and mineralocorticoid receptors. It has weak affinity for the androgen receptor, with about 8% of relative binding affinity of testosterone according to one study, and shows agonistic activity at this receptor. However, estrogens circulate in the picomolar (10‚àí12 M) range while androgens circulate in the nanomolar (10‚àí9 M) to micromolar (10‚àí6 M) range, and in accordance with this, estradiol is active as an estrogen in target tissues at approximately 1,000-fold lower concentrations than is testosterone. In addition, while estradiol did show activation of the androgen receptor in vitro at very high concentrations, its efficacy as an androgen receptor agonist was of such low potency that it was not possible to calculate an value for the activity. As such, the weak activity of estradiol at the androgen receptor is unlikely to be of biological significance at normal physiological concentrations. The affinities of estradiol for the ERs are high (around 0.1 nM), and there is a relatively low quantity of about 10,000 to 20,000 ERs in the cytoplasm per cell in estrogen target tissues. Estradiol stays bound to the ERs for about 24 hours, which is longer than that of other estrogens such as estriol (6 hours). A prolonged duration of binding to the ERs (e.g., 9 to 12 hours for endometrial effects), as with estradiol, is necessary for full estrogenic responses in various tissues. The ERs downregulate with exposure to estradiol, and in accordance, the expression of the ERs is dependent on estradiol concentrations. Constant levels of estradiol may result in downregulation of the ERs and relatively diminished responses to estradiol, although this has not been assessed clinically. Once bound to estradiol, the ERs are ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes, which is a major mechanism of ER downregulation. The unbound ERŒ± has an intracellular half-life of up to 5 days, but this shortens to hours once bound to a ligand such as estradiol. Estrogen deprivation can easily increase sensitivity to estrogens like estradiol by 10,000-fold or more, demonstrating a profound capacity of the ERs for upregulation and downregulation. This increase in sensitivity is mediated by a 100-fold increase in ERs, as well as other mechanisms such as changes in coactivator sensitivity and degree of phosphorylation of transactivation factors. Progestogens like progesterone and androgens like testosterone downregulate the ERs in certain tissues such as the endometrium and breasts, among others. Estradiol is a steroid and a lipophilic compound. As a result, it readily enters cells via simple passive diffusion through the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. This is in contrast to hydrophilic estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate and estradiol glucuronide, which require active transport via specific membrane transport proteins to enter cells. The ERs are nuclear receptors that are mostly present in the cell nucleus. Upon binding of estradiol to an ER, the receptor dimerizes (combines) with another estradiol- bound ER. These ER dimers can be ERŒ±‚ÄìERŒ± or ERŒ≤‚ÄìERŒ≤ homodimers or ERŒ±‚ÄìERŒ≤ heterodimers. Once in the dimerized state, the estradiol-bound ER‚ÄìER complex binds to short estrogen response elements (EREs) (of the minimal nucleotide sequence 5'-GGTCANNNTGACC-3', where N is any nucleotide) in the promoter regions of estrogen-responsive genes on chromosomes, in turn modulating their expression. Some prominent examples ERE-containing and hence estrogen- modulated genes in humans include the genes encoding the proteins oxytocin, c-fos, c-myc, and transforming growth factor alpha (TGFŒ±). Effects in the body and brain The ERs are expressed widely throughout the body, including in the breasts, uterus, vagina, prostate gland, fat, skin, bone, liver, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and elsewhere throughout the brain. Through activation of the ERs (as well as the mERs), estradiol has many effects, including the following: * Promotes growth, function, and maintenance of the breasts, uterus, and vagina during puberty and thereafter * Mediates deposition of subcutaneous fat in a feminine pattern, especially in the breasts, hips, buttocks, and thighs * Maintains skin health, integrity, appearance, and hydration and slows the rate of aging of the skin * Produces the growth spurt and epiphyseal closure in both sexes during puberty, mediates widening of the hips in females during puberty, and maintains bone mineral density in both sexes throughout life * Modulates hepatic protein synthesis, such as the production of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and numerous other proteins, with consequent effects on the cardiovascular system and various other systems * Exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis) by suppressing the secretion of the gonadotropins FSH and LH from the pituitary gland, thereby inhibiting gonadal sex hormone production as well as ovulation and fertility * Regulates the vasomotor system and body temperature via the hypothalamus, thereby preventing hot flashes * Modulates brain function, with effects on mood, emotionality, and sexuality, as well as cognition and memory * Influences the risk and/or progression of hormone-sensitive cancers including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and endometrial cancer Estrogen has also been found to increase the secretion of oxytocin and to increase the expression of its receptor, the oxytocin receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol has been found to be sufficient to increase circulating oxytocin concentrations. =Effects on sex-hormone levels= Antigonadotropic effects Estrogens are powerful antigonadotropins at sufficiently high concentrations. By exerting negative feedback on the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis), they are able to suppress the secretion of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, and thereby inhibit gonadal sex hormone production and circulating sex hormone levels as well as fertility (ovulation in women and spermatogenesis in men). Clinical studies have found that in men treated with them, estrogens can maximally suppress testosterone levels by about 95% or well into the castrate/female range (<50 ng/dL). This is equivalent to the reduction in testosterone levels achieved by orchiectomy and gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue (GnRH analogue) therapy, corresponding to a complete shutdown of gonadal testosterone production. In addition, it is greater than that achieved with high-dose progestogens like cyproterone acetate and gestonorone caproate, which can maximally suppress testosterone levels in men by about 75%. Inhibition of ovulation by estradiol monotherapy in women has been studied and demonstrated for oral estradiol, transdermal estradiol patches, subcutaneous estradiol implants, and intramuscular estradiol undecylate injections. A study of ovulation inhibition in women found that oral non-micronized estradiol was 55% effective at 1 mg/day, 61% effective at 2 mg/day, and 88% effective at 5 mg/day. Suppression of testosterone levels by estradiol to within the castrate/female range (<50 ng/dL) in men requires relatively high levels of estradiol and has been associated with circulating levels of 200 to 300 pg/mL and above. However, although the castrate range in men has been defined as testosterone concentrations of less than 50 ng/dL, mean levels of testosterone with surgical castration are actually about 15 ng/dL. To achieve such levels of testosterone with estradiol therapy, higher concentrations of estradiol of about 500 pg/mL have been necessary to produce the requisite maximal suppression of testosterone production. Injected estradiol esters like polyestradiol phosphate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol undecylate, as well as high-dose estradiol transdermal patches, are used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy to suppress testosterone levels into the castrate range in men with prostate cancer. High dosages of estradiol in various forms and routes are also used to suppress testosterone levels in transgender women. The suppression of testosterone levels by estradiol in men is rapid. A single intramuscular injection of 2 mg aqueous estradiol suppressed testosterone levels in young men from 760 ng/dL at baseline to 295 ng/dL (60% reduction) after 24 hours and to a maximum of 123 ng/dL (85% reduction) after 36 hours. Lower dosages and concentrations of estradiol can also significantly suppress gonadotropin secretion and testosterone levels in men and transgender women. A retrospective study of oral estradiol monotherapy in transgender women found that dosages of 1 to 8 mg/day increased mean estradiol levels to about 50 to 150 pg/mL and suppressed mean testosterone levels to about 10 to 120 ng/dL. However, there was high interindividual variability in the estradiol and testosterone levels achieved, and testosterone levels were insufficiently suppressed in many even at 8 mg/day. In another study, a dosage of 1 mg/day oral micronized estradiol in healthy older men, which increased circulating estradiol levels by a relatively high amount of 6-fold (to 159 pg/mL), estrone levels by 15-fold (to 386 pg/mL), and SHBG levels by 17%, was found to suppress total testosterone levels by 27% (to 436 ng/dL) and free testosterone levels by 34% (to 11.8 ng/dL). A pharmacodynamic study of testosterone suppression by polyestradiol phosphate in men with prostate cancer found that estradiol levels of about 135 pg/mL (500 pmol/L) would decrease testosterone levels by 50% (from 430 ng/dL to 215 ng/dL), while estradiol levels of about 410 to 545 pg/mL (1500‚Äì2000 pmol/L) would decrease testosterone levels well into the castrate range to about 6 to 12 ng/dL (0.2‚Äì0.4 nmol/L). Oral conjugated estrogens at a dosage of 7.5 mg/day has been found to suppress total testosterone levels in men to an equivalent extent as 3 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol, which is the minimum dosage of diethylstilbestrol required to consistently suppress total testosterone levels into the castrate range (<50 ng/dL). The equivalent dosage in the case of oral estradiol has not been reported. However, on the basis of the results of one study, it appears to be greater than 8 mg/day. In addition, oral estradiol is known to have similar or slightly lower antigonadotropic potency than oral conjugated estrogens; the potencies of oral conjugated estrogens in terms of suppression of LH and FSH levels are 1.0 and 1.1‚Äì1.3 relative to oral estradiol, respectively. In addition to their antigonadotropic effects, high concentrations of estrogens appear to have toxic effects in the testes, and, with long-term (>3 years) therapy, can possibly permanently reduce the capacity of the testes to produce testosterone. Long-lasting suppression of pituitary gland function, persisting even after estrogen discontinuation, may also be involved. With shorter-term therapy, testicular morphology has been reported to return to normal within 18 to 24 months. Progonadotropic effects Generally, estrogens are antigonadotropic and inhibit gonadotropin secretion. However, in women, a sharp increase in estradiol levels to about 200 to 500 pg/mL occurs at the end of the follicular phase (mid-cycle) during the normal menstrual cycle and paradoxically triggers a surge in LH and FSH secretion. This occurs when estradiol concentrations reach levels of about 250 to 300 pg/mL. During the mid-cycle surge, LH levels increase by 3- to 12-fold and FSH levels increase by 2- to 4-fold. The surge lasts about 24 to 36 hours and triggers ovulation, the rupture of the dominant ovarian follicle and the release of the egg from the ovary into the oviduct. This estrogen-mediated gonadotropin surge effect has also been found to occur with exogenous estrogen, including in transgender women on hormone therapy and pre-hormone therapy transgender men acutely challenged with a high dose of an estrogen, but does not occur in men, pre- hormone therapy transgender women, or transgender men on hormone therapy, hence indicating a hormonally-based sex difference. A sufficient amount of progesterone (corresponding to levels greater than 2 ng/mL) or a progestin prevents the mid-cycle estradiol-induced surge in gonadotropin levels in women. This is how progestins prevent ovulation and in part mediate their contraceptive effects in women. Effects on adrenal androgen levels In addition to their antigonadotropic effects, estrogens at high concentrations can significantly decrease androgen production by the adrenal glands. A study found that treatment with a high dosage of ethinylestradiol (100 ¬µg/day) reduced circulating adrenal androgen levels by 27 to 48% in transgender women. Another study found similar effects in men with prostate cancer, with levels of the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (A4) all decreasing significantly more with high-dose estrogen therapy (oral ethinylestradiol plus intramuscular polyestradiol phosphate) than with orchiectomy (by 33‚Äì39% and 10‚Äì26%, respectively). However, a study found that these effects occurred with high- dose oral and synthetic estrogens such as ethinylestradiol and estramustine phosphate but not with the parenteral estrogen polyestradiol phosphate, suggesting that decreases in adrenal androgen levels are secondary to changes in liver protein synthesis rather than due to a direct action in the adrenal cortex, and that such changes will only occur in the context of strong hepatic impact. Cortisol levels were unchanged in the other groups (e.g., orchiectomy, GnRH agonist therapy, and parenteral estrogen therapy) in this study, but increased by 300 to 400% in the oral and synthetic estrogen groups, likely secondary to increases in hepatic corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) production and compensatory upregulation of adrenal corticosteroid synthesis. Changes in levels of weak adrenal androgens are of relevance as these androgens serve as circulating reservoir of precursors that are transformed in tissues into potent androgens like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone and into estrogens. =Effects on liver protein synthesis= Estradiol and other estrogens modulate liver protein synthesis via activation of hepatic ERs. Estradiol increases the production and by extension circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), angiotensinogen (AGT), pregnancy zone protein (PZP), coagulation factors, and numerous other hepatic proteins. Conversely, estradiol decreases hepatic synthesis and by extension circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). The effects of estradiol on liver protein synthesis are moderated by route of administration, with oral administration having 4- or 5-fold stronger effects on liver protein synthesis than doses by the transdermal route with equivalent general/systemic estrogenic potency. The influences of estradiol on liver protein synthesis have a variety of effects in the body, with implications for the bioavailability of androgens and the cardiovascular system. The influence of 2 mg/day oral estradiol on levels of hepatic proteins such as SHBG, CBG, and AGT is much lower than that with 10 Œºg/day oral ethinylestradiol. Vaginal micronized estradiol at 0.25 mg/day increased SHBG levels by about 10% after 2 weeks of therapy in women. Estradiol-containing birth control pills, which contain 1 to 3 mg/day estradiol or estradiol valerate, have been found to increase SHBG levels by 1.5-fold. Both oral estradiol valerate at 6 mg/day and intrasmuscular estradiol valerate at 10 mg every 10 days have been found to increase SHBG levels by 2.5- to 3-fold in transgender women. For comparison, combined birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin with minimal androgenic or antiandrogenic activity have been found to increase SHBG levels by about 3- to 4-fold. High- dose polyestradiol phosphate by intramuscular injection has been found to increase SHBG levels by about 1.5-fold. Estradiol valerate in oil solution by intramuscular injection has been studied in the treatment of prostate cancer. Although parenteral estradiol has diminished effects on liver protein synthesis and by extension coagulation and cardiovascular risk compared to oral estradiol and non-bioidentical estrogens, a property attributable to its absence of disproportionate effects on the liver, sufficient doses of parenteral estradiol can nonetheless result in high estradiol concentrations in the liver and may increase coagulation and cardiovascular risk similarly. Estradiol valerate at a dose of 10 to 40 mg by intramuscular injection once every 2 weeks in men with prostate cancer has been found to increase markers of coagulation and plasminogen system activation such as levels of thrombin‚Äìantithrombin complex and quantitative D-dimers. Administration of daily prophylactic anticoagulation in the form of low molecular-weight heparin was able to successfully return these hemostasis markers to baseline. Doses of estradiol valerate of 10 to 40 mg by intramuscular injection have also been used to limit bleeding in women with hemorrhage due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding, although this is due primarily to stimulation of uterine growth. =Other effects= Estrogens have been reported to downregulate androgen receptor expression in adipose tissue, and may thereby inhibit the effects of androgens on fat distribution. Differences from other estrogens Changes in levels of estrogen-sensitive proteins after treatment with oral estradiol or oral ethinylestradiol in postmenopausal women. FSH is a pituitary protein and represents general/systemic estrogenic effect, while SHBG and are hepatic proteins and represent liver estrogenic effect. SHBG levels in men with 1) intramuscular injection of 320 mg polyestradiol phosphate once every 4 weeks alone; 2) the combination of intra- muscular injection of 80 mg polyestradiol phosphate once every 4 weeks plus 150 ¬µg/day oral ethinylestradiol; 3) orchiectomy only. Estradiol has relatively low oral bioavailability of about 5%. In addition, there is considerable interindividual variability in levels of estradiol achieved with oral estradiol. In contrast to estradiol, the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol has about 45% oral bioavailability, around 80- to 200-fold greater systemic oral estrogenic potency, roughly 500- to 1,500-fold greater hepatic oral estrogenic potency, and less interindividual variability in circulating estrogen levels achieved. An oral dose of ethinylestradiol that is approximately 100-fold lower than that of estradiol achieves similar maximal circulating estrogen concentrations (e.g., 50 pg/mL ethinylestradiol with a single 20 Œºg dose of ethinylestradiol relative to 40 pg/mL estradiol with a single 2 mg dose of micronized estradiol or estradiol valerate). These differences are due to the introduction of an ethynyl group at the C17Œ± position in ethinylestradiol (also known as 17Œ±-ethynylestradiol), which results in steric hindrance and greatly diminishes the first-pass metabolism of ethinylestradiol relative to estradiol with oral administration. Estradiol and ethinylestradiol have similar affinities for and efficacies as agonists of the ERs, and the systemic estrogenic potency of estradiol and ethinylestradiol is similar when they are administered by the intravenous route. Synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol and the natural but animal-derived conjugated estrogens have disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis relative to their effects in other tissues when compared to estradiol. At doses via the oral route with comparable systemic estrogenic potency, conjugated estrogens have about 1.3 to 4.5 times the hepatotropic potency (i.e., potency in modulating liver protein synthesis) of estradiol, ethinylestradiol has about 2.9 to 5.0 times the hepatotropic potency of estradiol, and diethylstilbestrol shows about 5.7 to 7.5 times the hepatotropic potency of estradiol (all measured via a small selection of estrogen-modulated hepatic proteins that included cholesterol, , , and angiotensinogen). The greater hepatotropic potency of these estrogens relative to estradiol is related to susceptibility to hepatic metabolism. Whereas estradiol is metabolized and thereby inactivated rapidly upon entry into the liver, other estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol are resistant to hepatic metabolism and persist in the liver for a longer amount of time. This is reflected in the biological half-lives of these estrogens; the blood half-life of estradiol is about 1 to 2 hours, while the half-lives of ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol are approximately 20 hours and 24 hours, respectively. In accordance with its long half-life, ethinylestradiol passes through the liver many times prior to its elimination. Because humans are not adapted to efficiently metabolize conjugated estrogens (which are equine (horse) estrogens) and synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol, these estrogens are not properly inactivated in the liver, with markedly disproportionate hepatic estrogenic effects resulting. In addition to differences in hepatotropic potency between estradiol and other estrogens, there are differences in hepatotropic potency between different routes of administration of estradiol. Due to the first pass through the liver, oral estradiol results in disproportionate and unphysiological hepatic estradiol levels that are 4- to 5-fold higher than in the circulation. Conversely, parenteral routes of estradiol, such as transdermal, vaginal, and injection, bypass the first pass through the liver and produce levels of estradiol in the circulation and liver that are comparable. As an example of the reduced hepatic impact of parenteral estradiol relative to oral estradiol, a study found that 1 mg/day oral estradiol significantly increased SHBG levels by 45%, while 50 ¬µg/day transdermal estradiol increased SHBG levels non- significantly by only 12% (with these dosages being roughly equivalent in systemic estrogenic potency). As such, not only do oral non-bioidentical estrogens like ethinylestradiol and conjugated estrogens have substantially greater potency in the liver than does oral estradiol, oral estradiol has considerably greater potency in the liver than does parenteral estradiol. Thus, the hepatotropic effects of oral non-bioidentical estrogens like ethinylestradiol are massive in comparison to parenteral estradiol (see the graph above/to the right), which in contrast to these estrogens has very weak or even absent effects on liver protein synthesis at normal therapeutic dosages. Whereas high-dosage 320 mg/month intramuscular polyestradiol phosphate increased SHBG levels to 166% in men with prostate cancer, the combination of 80 mg/month intramuscular polyestradiol phosphate and high- dosage 150 ¬µg/day oral ethinylestradiol increased levels of SHBG to 617%, an almost 8-fold difference in increase and almost 4-fold difference in absolute levels between the two treatment regimens. The effects of estrogens on liver protein synthesis, such as on the synthesis of coagulation factors, lipoproteins, and triglycerides, can cause an increased risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications, which in turn can result in increased mortality. The risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications is significantly increased in postmenopausal women taking oral conjugated estrogens as a component of menopausal hormone therapy. Both oral estradiol and oral esterified estrogens have been found to have a significantly lower risk of thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications than oral conjugated estrogens, and transdermal estradiol appears to have no such risks at all. Widely employed in the past, oral synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol are no longer used in menopausal hormone therapy due to their high risks of thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications. Studies have found a markedly increased 5-year risk of cardiovascular mortality of 14 to 26% in men treated with high-dosage oral synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol for prostate cancer. With diethylstilbestrol, there is an up to 35% incidence of cardiovascular toxicity and an up to 15% incidence of venous thromboembolism. In a small study comparing high-dosage 320 mg/month intramuscular polyestradiol phosphate versus the combination of 80 mg/month polyestradiol phosphate with high-dosage 150 ¬µg/day oral ethinylestradiol for prostate cancer, there was a 25% incidence of cardiovascular complications over the course of a year in the group that was also treated with ethinylestradiol, whereas there were no cardiovascular complications in the polyestradiol phosphate-only group. In accordance, another study found no change in levels of coagulation factor VII, a protein of particular importance in the cardiovascular side effects of estrogens, with 240 mg/month intramuscular polyestradiol phosphate. In spite of the markedly reduced impact of parenteral estradiol on the liver compared to other estrogens however, high dosages of parenteral estradiol, producing high levels of circulating estradiol, can still result in important and undesirable changes in liver protein synthesis as with other estrogens. A high dosage of 320 mg/month polyestradiol phosphate has been found to result in significantly increased cardiovascular morbidity (due to non-fatal ischemic heart events and heart decompensation) in men with prostate cancer in two large studies, though cardiovascular mortality was notably not increased. In addition to the liver, ethinylestradiol shows disproportionate estrogenic effects in the uterus. This is due to its inability to be inactivated by uterine 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Œ≤-HSD). Because of its disproportionate effects in the uterus, ethinylestradiol is associated with a significantly lower incidence of vaginal bleeding and spotting than is estradiol, particularly in combination with progestogens (which induce 17Œ≤-HSD expression and hence estradiol metabolism in the uterus), and is an important contributing factor in why ethinylestradiol, among other reasons and in spite of its inferior safety profile, has been widely used in oral contraceptives instead of estradiol. Although ethinylestradiol has increased effects in the uterus relative to estradiol, it is similarly not associated with an increase in the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer when used in combination with a progestogen, but instead with a significant decrease.

Estradiol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production in both women and men. Estradiol differs from non- bioidentical estrogens like conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol in various ways, with implications for tolerability and safety. Estradiol can be taken by mouth, held under the tongue, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle or fat, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes. Routes of administration Estradiol can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches), vaginal (tablets, creams, rings, suppositories), rectal, by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil or aqueous), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of estradiol, and its local effects in certain tissues, most importantly the liver, differ by route of administration as well. In particular, the oral route is subject to a high first-pass effect, which results in high levels of estradiol and consequent estrogenic effects in the liver and low potency due to first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism into metabolites like estrone and estrogen conjugates. Conversely, this is not the case for parenteral (non- oral) routes, which bypass the intestines and liver. Different estradiol routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating estradiol levels (see the table below). For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, menstrual cycle circulating levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are 40 pg/mL in the early follicular phase, 250 pg/mL at the middle of the cycle, and 100 pg/mL during the mid-luteal phase. Mean integrated levels of circulating estradiol in premenopausal women across the whole menstrual cycle are in the range of 80 to 150 pg/mL, according to some sources. In postmenopausal women, circulating levels of estradiol are below 15 pg/mL. During normal human pregnancy, estrogen production increases progressively and extremely high estrogen levels are attained. Estradiol levels range from 1,000 to 40,000 pg/mL across pregnancy,http://www.ilexmedical.com/files/PDF/Estradiol_ARC.pdf are on average 25,000 pg/mL at term, and reach levels as high as 75,000 pg/mL in some women. =Oral administration= Absorption and bioavailability The oral bioavailability of estradiol is very low. This is due to the fact that estradiol is poorly soluble in water, which limits its dissolution and absorption, and is additionally subject to extensive metabolism during the first pass through the intestines and liver. Estradiol is micronized and/or conjugated with an ester, as in estradiol valerate or estradiol acetate, to improve its oral bioavailability and potency. Micronization decreases the particle size of estradiol crystals and hence increases the surface area for absorption, thereby improving the rate and extent of absorption. In addition, there is an improvement in metabolic stability. Oral micronized estradiol consists of more than 80% of estradiol particles micronized to a size smaller than 20 Œºm in diameter, or to about 1 to 3 Œºm on average. All oral formulations of estradiol available today are micronized, and oral estradiol valerate tablets also seem to be micronized. Oral non-micronized estradiol and oral micronized estradiol do not appear to have ever been directly compared in a study. Both have been assessed independently however, and have been found to produce significant estrogenic effects. Micronization of other poorly water- soluble steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate has been found to increase their potency by several-fold. In accordance, studies of the amount of oral estradiol necessary for endometrial proliferation in women have reported a total dose of 60 mg for micronized estradiol relative to 120 to 300 mg or more for non-micronized estradiol. As such, micronization has been said to substantially improve the potency of oral estradiol. A study compared different particle sizes of oral micronized estradiol. A preparation with the smallest particles (mainly <0.6 Œºm) was found to have the most rapid absorption and the highest bioavailability. However, a sharp peak in estradiol levels, without an accompanying rise in estrone levels, was observed during the first 2 hours with this particle size. It was suggested that the smallest estradiol particles may have been absorbed by the lymphatic system, partially bypassing first-pass metabolism and resulting in very high initial estradiol levels. The preparations with the larger particle sizes (mainly <3.5 Œºm and <20 Œºm) were found to be absorbed more slowly, without a pronounced initial peak in estradiol levels. Levels of estradiol were more even and similar to physiological levels with these particle sizes. Differences in area-under-the- curve estradiol levels with the different particle sizes were relatively small. As such, micronization may improve absorption but does not necessarily improve therapeutic effect. Micronized estradiol is rapidly and completely absorbed with oral administration. This is true for oral doses of 2 mg and 4 mg, but absorption was found to be incomplete for an oral dose of 8 mg. This dose showed 76% of the expected bioavailability based on dose proportionality and area-under-the-curve levels, indicating a small deviation from linearity. The absolute bioavailability of oral micronized estradiol is approximately 5%, with a possible range of 0.1% to 12%. As such, the bioavailability of oral estradiol is very low even with micronization. There is high interindividual variability in the levels of estradiol achieved with oral estradiol, which is likely related to the high first-pass effect. This variation has been reported to be in the range of 28 to 127%, or about 4.6-fold maximal difference in levels between individuals, in terms of mean area-under-the-curve levels of estradiol. In postmenopausal women, a dosage of 1 mg/day oral micronized estradiol has been found to produce circulating concentrations of 30 to 50 pg/mL estradiol and 150 to 300 pg/mL estrone, while a dosage of 2 mg/day has been found to result in circulating levels of 50 to 180 pg/mL estradiol and 300 to 850 pg/mL estrone. A study of oral micronized estradiol in transgender women found that mean estradiol levels across a dosage range of 1 to 8 mg/day were about 50 pg/mL at 1 mg/day, 100 pg/mL at 4 mg/day, and 150 pg/mL at 8 mg/day, with a wide degree of variation. In another study, mean estradiol levels at steady state with 4 mg/day and 6 mg/day oral micronized estradiol were approximately 180 pg/mL and 265 pg/mL, respectively. A study that used high to very high-dose oral micronized estradiol in postmenopausal women found that steady-state estradiol levels with 6 mg/day were about 300 pg/mL and with 30 mg/day were about 2,400 pg/mL. Estradiol valerate is rapidly hydrolyzed into estradiol in the intestines. For this reason, oral estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have very similar pharmacokinetics. Due to the presence of its valeric acid ester and differences in molecular weight, estradiol valerate contains about 76% of the same amount of estradiol by weight. As a result, 2 mg oral estradiol valerate produces equivalent estradiol levels to about 1.5 mg oral estradiol. Metabolism and elimination When taken orally, about 95% of a dose of estradiol is metabolized in the intestines and liver into estrone and estrogen conjugates such as estrone sulfate, estrone glucuronide, and estradiol sulfate, among others, prior to entering the circulation. As a result, circulating estrone and estrogen conjugate levels are markedly elevated, in a highly unphysiological manner, with oral estradiol. Whereas the ratio of circulating estradiol to estrone is about 1:1 in premenopausal women and with transdermal estradiol, oral estradiol produces a ratio of about 1:5 on average and as high as 1:20 in some women. In addition, whereas levels of estradiol with menopausal replacement dosages of oral estradiol are in the range of the follicular phase of the normal menstrual cycle, levels of estrone resemble those during the first trimester of pregnancy. Moreover, whereas normal physiological estrone sulfate levels are 10 to 25 times higher than those of estradiol and estrone in premenopausal women, levels of estrone sulfate with oral estradiol are an additional 8 to 20 times higher than normal premenopausal or postmenopausal estrone sulfate levels. One study found that estrone sulfate levels were 200-fold higher than estradiol levels with 2 mg/day oral micronized estradiol or oral estradiol valerate, and estrone sulfate levels can reach up to nearly 1,000-fold higher concentrations than estradiol in some cases. In contrast to oral estradiol, due to the lack of the first pass, an excess in estrone and estrogen conjugate levels does not occur with transdermal estradiol or other parenteral estradiol routes. The transformation of estradiol into estrone and estrogen conjugates is reversible. As such, these metabolites can be converted back into estradiol. About 15% of orally administered estradiol is transformed into estrone and 65% into estrone sulfate. About 5% of estrone and 1.4% of estrone sulfate is converted back into estradiol. An additional 21% of estrone sulfate is converted into estrone, whereas transformation of estrone into estrone sulfate is approximately 54%. The interconversion between estradiol and estrone is mediated by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (17Œ≤-HSDs), whereas the conversion of estrone into estrone sulfate is mediated by estrogen sulfotransferases (ESTs) and the transformation of estrone sulfate into estrone by steroid sulfatase (STS). The metabolic clearance rates and hence blood half-lives of estrogen conjugates like estrone sulfate are much longer than those of estradiol and estrone. Estrogen conjugates, primarily estrone sulfate, serve as a large circulating reservoir for estradiol, and because of this, they function to greatly extend the biological half-life of oral estradiol. As such, the biological half-life of oral estradiol is a composite parameter that is dependent on interconversion between estradiol and estrogen conjugates, as well as on enterohepatic recirculation. Whereas the biological half-life of estradiol given by intravenous injection is about 0.5 to 2 hours, the biological half-life of oral estradiol has a range of 13 to 20 hours due to the large and long-lasting pool of estrogen conjugates that is formed during first-pass metabolism and that serves to continuously replenish circulating estradiol levels. First-pass effect and differences from other routes The first-pass effect that occurs with oral estradiol results in unusually high levels of estrone and estrogen conjugates in the circulation as well as of estradiol in the liver. These unique properties of oral estradiol result in a number of pharmacological differences relative to the other routes of administration of estradiol. The high levels of estrone and estrogen conjugates that occur with oral estradiol raise the question of the pharmacodynamic significance of these metabolites. In contrast to estradiol however, estrone has very low activity as an estrogen. The affinities of estrone for the human ERs and its estrogenic activity have been reported to be approximately 3 to 4% of those of estradiol. In addition, unlike estradiol and estriol, estrone is not accumulated in target tissues. Because estrone can be transformed into estradiol, most of its activity in vivo is actually due to conversion into estradiol. In accordance, doses of oral and transdermal estradiol that achieve similar levels of estradiol have been found, in spite of markedly elevated levels of estrone with oral estradiol but not with transdermal estradiol, to possess equivalent and non-significantly different potency in terms of clinical measures including suppression of LH and FSH levels, inhibition of bone resorption, and relief of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes. In addition, estradiol levels were found to correlate with these effects, while estrone levels did not. These findings suggest that estrone contributes very little or not at all to the estrogenic potency of estradiol, while also not antagonizing the estrogenic activity of estradiol. This contradicts some cell-free in-vitro research suggesting that high concentrations of estrone might be able to partially antagonize the actions of estradiol. On the other hand, it has been suggested by some authors that the high levels of estrone and/or estrone conjugates with oral estradiol may result in excessive estradiol levels in certain tissues such as the breasts and endometrium, due to high expression in these tissues of the requisite enzymes (17Œ≤-HSDs and STS) necessary to transform these metabolites back into estradiol. In accordance, circulating levels of estrone sulfate have been found to be positively associated with breast density in postmenopausal women treated with oral estradiol, with 1.3% higher breast density observed for every 1 ng/mL greater level of estrone sulfate. Similarly, levels of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate are all strongly associated with the risk of breast cancer in women. Preclinical studies have shown that estrone sulfate, via local transformation into estradiol, stimulates the growth of mammary cancer cells. Due to the first pass through the liver, disproportionate and supraphysiological levels of estrogens occur locally in the liver with oral estradiol. These levels are approximately 4- to 5-fold higher than in the circulation, based on differences in hepatic estrogenic potency for oral estradiol relative to transdermal estradiol. As a result, there is abnormally high estrogenic signaling in the liver with oral estradiol, and a variety of unphysiological effects on liver protein synthesis result. Through modulation of liver protein synthesis, oral estradiol increases the risk of blood clots, increases circulating levels of a variety of binding proteins including thyroid binding globulin (TBG), cortisol binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), growth hormone binding protein (GHBP), insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs), and copper binding protein (CBP), suppresses growth hormone (GH)-mediated insulin- like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) production, and produces positive blood lipid changes, among a variety of other effects. In contrast to oral estradiol, transdermal estradiol has relatively minimal impact on liver protein synthesis. As an example, a study found that 1 mg/day oral estradiol significantly increased SHBG levels by 45%, while 50 ¬µg/day transdermal estradiol increased SHBG levels non-significantly by only 12%. In the circulation, approximately 38% of estradiol is reversibly bound to SHBG and 60% is reversibly bound to albumin in women under normal physiological circumstances, with 2 to 3% of total estradiol circulating free or unbound at any given time. Only estradiol that is free or unbound is able to be enter target cells and hence is biologically active. The increase in SHBG levels with oral estradiol (e.g., +50%) can result in a clinically meaningful increase in the fractions of sex hormones like estradiol and testosterone that are bound to SHBG, whereas this is not the case with typical clinical dosages of transdermal estradiol. The increase in the fraction of estradiol bound to SHBG results in a significant decrease in the percentage of free or unbound and hence bioactive estradiol. As a result, the bioavailability and potency of oral estradiol may be diminished relative to parenteral estradiol routes by some amount. However, a study found that the free fraction of estradiol was similar with doses of oral and topical estradiol that resulted in equivalent total estradiol levels. Experimental oral formulations Estradiol decanoate, estradiol cyclooctyl acetate, and EC508 (estradiol 17Œ≤-(1-(4-(aminosulfonyl)benzoyl)-L-proline)) are estradiol esters and novel oral forms of estradiol that have been developed with improved properties, such as greater bioavailability and reduced first-pass effect. Estradiol decanoate and estradiol cyclooctyl acetate were studied for potential use in menopausal hormone therapy and birth control pills but were never marketed. EC508 is currently under active development for use in menopausal hormone therapy. =Buccal administration= Estradiol has been studied for use by buccal administration. Preclinical studies of buccal estradiol have also been conducted. Buccal and sublingual administration of estradiol have similar characteristics. Administration of a troche (lozenge) containing 0.25 mg estradiol via the buccal route resulted in peak estradiol levels of about 450 pg/mL at 1 hour post-dose in postmenopausal women. Following this, estradiol levels decreased to about 60 pg/mL at 4 hours post-dose and to about 15 pg/mL at 12 hours post-dose. With continuous twice daily administration of 0.25 mg estradiol (0.5 mg/day total) via the buccal route once every 12 hours, peak estradiol levels at steady state after the last dose were about 500 pg/mL. =Sublingual administration= Estradiol tablets can be taken sublingually instead of orally. Non-micronized estradiol tablets in doses of 0.125, 0.25, and 1 mg were previously marketed for use by sublingual administration under brand names such as Diogynets, Estradiol Membrettes, and Dimenformon in the 1950s. Non-micronized estradiol has poor water solubility, but micronized estradiol is rapidly absorbed by the sublingual route. All oral estradiol tablets are micronized, as this improves the efficiency of estradiol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Likewise, all oral estradiol valerate tablets seem to be micronized. The sublingual route is, in actuality, probably a combination of sublingual and oral delivery of estradiol due to incidental swallowing of some of the estradiol. The absorption of sublingual estradiol can be attributed to the rich vascularization under the tongue. With administration of an oral estradiol tablet sublingually, complete dissolution of the tablet occurs within a few minutes and circulating levels of estradiol begin to rise within 5 minutes. Maximal levels of estradiol occur after 30 to 60 minutes of administration. After this, estradiol levels drop steeply within 4 hours, and this is followed by a more gradual decline in levels of estradiol and a return to baseline concentrations by 24 hours. The rapid rise and steep fall of estradiol levels with sublingual administration of estradiol is analogous to the case of intravenous injection and intranasal administration of the hormone. Sublingual administration of medications that are subject to a high first-pass effect with oral administration can result in improved bioavailability because the first pass through the intestines and liver is bypassed. As a result, sublingual estradiol has been found to result in estradiol levels and a ratio of estradiol to estrone that are substantially higher than oral estradiol. Maximal circulating levels of estradiol are as much as 10-fold higher with sublingual administration than with oral administration, and the absolute bioavailability of estradiol is approximately 5-fold higher. On the other hand, levels of estradiol fall rapidly with sublingual administration, whereas they remain elevated for a prolonged period of time with oral administration. This is due to the large circulating pool of hormonally inert estrogen conjugates with long half-lives that is reversibly generated with oral estradiol during first-pass metabolism, which serves as a metabolism-resistant and long-lasting reservoir for continuous reconversion back into estradiol. It is also responsible for the differences in ratios between sublingual estradiol and oral estradiol in terms of maximal estradiol levels (10:1) achieved and absolute bioavailability (5:1). A study in marmoset monkeys found that the bioavailability of sublingual estradiol was 10% of that of estradiol administered by intramuscular injection. After a dose of sublingual estradiol, levels of estrone start to slowly but progressively rise within 10 minutes. Estrone levels surpass estradiol levels at around 2 hours post-dose and reach a maximum at about 4 hours. It has been speculated that the high delayed levels of estrone with sublingual estradiol may be due to the rich lymphatic drainage in the neck region, which may result in estradiol being taken up by the reticuloendothelial system and then metabolized into estrone. Sublingual administration of a single 0.25 mg tablet of micronized estradiol has been found to produce peak levels of 300 pg/mL estradiol and 60 pg/mL estrone within 1 hour. A higher dose of 1 mg estradiol was found to result in maximum levels of 450 pg/mL estradiol and 165 pg/mL estrone, which was followed by a rapid decline in estradiol levels to 85 pg/mL within 3 hours. Conversely, the decline in estrone levels was much slower and reached a level of 80 pg/mL after 18 hours. A single administration of 4 mg micronized estradiol (two 2-mg Estrace tablets) under the tongue, considered a very high dose of sublingual estradiol, has been found to result in maximal levels of estradiol of 1759 ¬± 704 pg/mL, with a range of 634 to 2840 pg/mL, after 1 hour in a mixed group of normotensive and hypertensive postmenopausal women. A replication of this study using the same dosage and protocols measured estradiol levels of 2227 ¬± 1180 pg/mL for the whole group of women but found that estradiol levels between the normotensive and hypertensive groups were significantly different at 1790 ¬± 869 pg/mL and 2664 ¬± 1490 pg/mL, respectively. Although sublingual administration of estradiol has a relatively short duration, the medication can be administered multiple times per day in divided doses to compensate for this. Studies that used high doses of sublingual estradiol in the treatment of severe postpartum depression have administered a dose of 1 mg 3 to 8 times per day. In one study, which administered a mean total dosage of sublingual estradiol of 4.8 mg/day, estradiol levels remained elevated at about 130 pg/mL on average in the morning before the first dose of the day. Oral micronized estradiol valerate tablets can be taken sublingually as well. The administration of 2 mg oral micronized estradiol valerate tablets (Progynova, Schering) sublingually 3 or 4 times per day resulted in circulating estradiol levels of about 290 pg/mL to 460 pg/mL in premenopausal women (time of measurements not given). Steady- state levels of estradiol were achieved within about 5 or 6 days. Levels of progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and follicle-stimulating hormone were all considerably suppressed, and ovulation, as well as the associated mid-cycle hormonal surges, were prevented. Sublingual estradiol valerate is used for cycle control in egg donation and surrogacy in cisgender women and is used in hormone therapy for transgender women. Cyclodextrin-containing formulations of sublingual estradiol with improved water solubility and absorption have been developed and studied. Clinical effects The total endometrial proliferation dose of sublingual estradiol in women is 60 to 140 mg per cycle or 14 days and of sublingual estradiol benzoate in women is 60 to 180 mg per cycle or 14 days. Both sublingual estradiol and sublingual estradiol benzoate have a persistence of estrogenic effect after a dose of only one day. The effects of sublingual estradiol on gonadotropin levels have also been studied in postmenopausal women. After a dose of sublingual estradiol, levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) decrease precipitously within 4 hours. Following this, LH and FSH levels gradually increase, and return to near-baseline levels by 24 hours. One study found no difference between oral and sublingual estradiol in suppression of LH levels. However, FSH levels were suppressed to a greater extent with sublingual estradiol than with oral estradiol in the study. It is notable that the magnitude of the genomic effects of estradiol (i.e., signaling through the nuclear ERs) may, at least in some cases, be dependent on the total estrogenic exposure as opposed to the duration of exposure. For instance, in normal human epithelial breast cells and ER-positive breast cancer cells, the rate of breast cell proliferation has been found not to differ with estradiol incubation of 1 nM for 24 hours and incubation of 24 nM for 1 hour. In other words, short-term high concentrations and long-term low concentrations of estradiol appear to have the same degree of effect in terms of genomic estrogenic signaling, at least in terms of breast cell proliferation over a 24-hour period. On the other hand, non-genomic actions of estradiol, such as signaling through membrane estrogen receptors like the GPER, may be reduced with short-term high concentrations of estradiol relative to more sustained levels. For instance, although daily intranasal administration of estradiol is associated with comparable clinical effectiveness (e.g., for hot flashes) relative to longer acting routes of estradiol administration in postmenopausal women, it is also associated with significantly lower rates of breast tension (tenderness and enlargement) relative to longer acting estradiol routes, and this is thought to reflect comparatively diminished non-genomic signaling. =Intranasal administration= Estradiol has been studied and used by intranasal administration. It was available as a cyclodextrin-containing nasal spray under the brand name Aerodiol in some countries, although this specific product was discontinued in 2007. The product was administered once per day as one 150-Œºg spray in each nostril (300 Œºg/day total).http://www.medicines.org.au/files/secaerod.pdf Intranasal estradiol has pharmacokinetics similar to those of sublingual and intravenous administration of estradiol, including a sharp peak and then rapid decline in estradiol levels. Despite the relatively short duration of intranasal estradiol, it has similar effectiveness to other, longer-lasting routes of administration in terms of relief of menopausal symptoms like hot flashes. =Transdermal administration= Transdermal estradiol is available in the forms of patches, gels, emulsions, and sprays. In the case of gels, emulsions, and sprays, the route is sometimes referred to as topical rather than as transdermal. Topical administration can also refer to vaginal administration of gels and creams however. Estradiol has moderate skin permeability, which is based on the lipophilicity and hydrophilicity of a compound. In general, the more polar groups, such as hydroxyl groups, that are present in a steroid, and hence the more hydrophilic and less lipophilic it is, the lower its skin permeability. For this reason, estrone and progesterone have higher skin permeability, while estriol and cortisol have lower skin permeability. The transdermal bioavailability of estradiol in an alcohol solution is approximately 10%. Transdermal estradiol reservoir patches have been reported to have a bioavailability of 3 to 5%. Estradiol is a highly potent compound and circulates at picomolar concentrations (pg/mL), which makes it ideal for transdermal application as only small amounts of substance need to be delivered across the skin. Conversely, progesterone, which circulates at levels in the nanomolar range and requires a far higher quantity of substance for biological effect, is not well-suited for transdermal delivery. Fatty acid esters of estradiol, such as estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol cypionate, have been found to have similar estrogenic potency to estradiol but a comparatively longer duration with transdermal administration in animal studies. Regardless of administration form, such as patch or gel, transdermal estradiol is transported into the skin, including through the stratum corneum, epidermis, and dermis, by a passive diffusion process. Following this, estradiol is then taken up by local capillary blood vessels and delivered into the circulation. There is a depot effect in the skin with transdermal estradiol, which results in continuous delivery of transdermal estradiol into the circulation. This is because the skin functions as a semipermeable membrane and there is a concentration gradient between the application site of transdermal estradiol and capillary blood, with the rate of diffusion of estradiol across the stratum corneum being the specific rate- limiting factor in absorption. As a result, peaks and troughs in circulating estradiol levels are limited, and the skin and subcutaneous fat act as a reservoir of estradiol that maintains circulating estradiol levels between doses. For these reasons, transdermal estradiol can provide near-constant circulating levels of estradiol, similarly to oral estradiol. Enzymes that metabolize estradiol are minimally expressed in the skin, and for this reason, the metabolism of estradiol in the skin is low. The site of application of transdermal estradiol can influence its bioavailability. A study found comparable absorption of transdermal estradiol patches (within ¬±25% of reference) for a number of skin sites including the abdomen, upper arm, upper thigh, lower back, and side. However, absorption was 15% lower for the upper thigh compared to the abdomen and the difference was significant. Another study found that transdermal estradiol patches had 20 to 25% higher bioavailability when applied to the buttocks than when applied to the abdomen. Studies of topical steroids have found that the scrotum is especially permeable among skin sites. Studies of transdermal testosterone cream, gel, and patches applied to the scrotum in men have observed 5- to 8-fold higher levels of testosterone than with application to conventional skin sites. In a study of topical application of hydrocortisone solution in men, skin permeability (defined as total radiolabeled urinary excretion) relative to the forearm (1.0) was 42.0 for the scrotum, 13.0 for the jaw angle, 6.0 for the forehead, 3.6 for the underarm, 3.5 for the scalp, 1.7 for the back, 0.8 for the palm of the hand, 0.4 for the ankle, and 0.1 for the sole of the foot. In accordance with findings with other topical steroids, a study in men with prostate cancer treated with transdermal estradiol patches applied to the scrotum observed about 5-fold higher estradiol levels relative to application to conventional skin sites such as the forearm. Penile skin may have similarly enhanced absorption characteristics relative to scrotal skin. Transdermal estradiol bypasses the intestines and liver and hence the first-pass metabolism that is associated with oral administration. In addition, unlike oral estradiol, transdermal estradiol is not associated with supraphysiological concentrations of estrone or estrogen conjugates like estradiol sulfate, and transdermal estradiol does not have disproportionate effects on liver protein synthesis. In accordance, estradiol, at typical menopausal replacement dosages, has been found not to increase the risk of blood clots or insulin resistance, nor to affect hepatic SHBG, IGF-1, GHBP, IGFBP, and other protein production and by extension circulating hepatic protein levels. However, at higher doses, transdermal estradiol has been associated with a significantly higher incidence of stroke in postmenopausal women, probably due to blood clots. Another larger study did not find a significantly higher risk of blood clots with similar doses of transdermal estradiol however. Transdermal patches Vivelle-Dot, an estradiol patch. Estradiol patches have an extended duration and are available for twice-weekly (3‚Äì4-day) and once-weekly (7-day) application, while gels, emulsions, and sprays are administered daily. There are two types of estradiol patches: reservoir patches, which have been described as first-generation patches, and matrix patches, which are considered to be improved second- generation patches. Reservoir patches were designed for twice-weekly application, while matrix patches have been produced for both twice-weekly and once-weekly application. Reservoir patches of estradiol (e.g., Estraderm) are mostly no longer used, with most estradiol patches available today being matrix patches (e.g., Alora, Climara, Esclim, Estradot, FemPatch, Menostar, Oesclim, Vivelle, and Vivelle-Dot). A dosage of 1 mg/day oral estradiol is considered to be roughly equivalent to 50 ¬µg/day transdermal estradiol and a dosage of 2 mg/day oral estradiol is considered to be equivalent to 100 ¬µg/day transdermal estradiol. Estradiol patches delivering a daily dosage of 0.05 mg (50 ¬µg) achieve mean estradiol and estrone levels of 30 to 65 pg/mL and 40 to 45 pg/mL, respectively, while a daily dosage of 0.1 mg (100 ¬µg) attains respective mean levels of 50 to 90 pg/mL and 30 to 65 pg/mL of estradiol and estrone. In general, Climara-type estradiol transdermal patches have an approximate 1:1 ratio of estradiol delivered in Œºg/day relative to circulating estradiol concentration in pg/mL. In other words, a 100 Œºg/day Climara estradiol patch may be expected to produce circulating estradiol levels of around 100 pg/mL. Transdermal estradiol patches produce an estradiol to estrone ratio of about 1:1. Following removal of an estradiol patch, circulating estradiol levels decrease to baseline within 24 hours. Typical dosages of estradiol patches are intended to provide the minimum amount of estrogen replacement necessary for the effective alleviation of menopausal symptoms, and for this reason, they achieve relatively low levels of estradiol. A dosage of two to six 100 ¬µg/day transdermal estradiol patches can achieve mean levels of estradiol in the area of 200 to 400 pg/mL and can be used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy, for instance to suppress testosterone levels in the treatment of prostate cancer in men and in feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. High-dose transdermal estradiol patches have also been studied in the treatment of postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis; in one such study, 200, 400, and 800 Œºg/day estradiol in the form of transdermal patches resulted in estradiol levels of 286 pg/mL, 675 pg/mL, and 1032 pg/mL, respectively. In another study, estradiol levels with 800 Œºg/day estradiol in the form of transdermal patches (Estraderm TTS) resulted in estradiol levels of 690 to 815 pg/mL. However, there is erratic absorption and considerable variation in estradiol levels using high-dose estradiol patches both between and within individuals, with one study finding that estradiol levels ranged from 70 pg/mL to 1,045 pg/mL. The Prostate Adenocarcinoma: TransCutaneous Hormones (PATCH) study is a randomized controlled trial of high-dose transdermal estradiol patches versus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist monotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer in approximately 2,200 men. It is specifically comparing three to four 100 Œºg/day estradiol patches (FemSeven) against goserelin implants. The study was started in March 2006 and is estimated for completion in August 2021. Its objectives include comparison of survival, cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, pharmacological activity (e.g., suppression of testosterone levels), other side effects and toxicities, and quality of life. In addition to the PATCH trial, the Systemic Therapy in Advancing or Metastatic Prostate Cancer: Evaluation of Drug Efficacy (STAMPEDE) study added a high-dose estradiol patches arm (~2,000 men) in July 2017. Estradiol patches are associated with local skin reactions and such as irritation in 14.2% of individuals (with reservoir patches), mild-to-moderate erythema (redness) in 50 to 60% of individuals, and allergic reactions due to cutaneous sensitization. Up to 5% of people using reservoir patches may discontinue therapy due to skin reactions. Visible adhesive residues are also often left by estradiol patches following their removal. Transdermal estradiol gel can serve as an alternative to transdermal estradiol patches for individuals who experience intolerable skin reactions with them. Estradiol patches should not be applied to the breast as this may result in high local levels of estradiol in the breasts and hence an increased likelihood of breast tenderness. Transdermal gel Estradiol is available as a transdermal gel in the form of gel dispensers and gel packets. Major estradiol gel dispenser products include EstroGel and Elestrin while major estradiol gel packet products include DiviGel and Sandrena. Estradiol gels are administered daily. When estradiol is administered as a hydroalcoholic gel, it dries within 2 to 5 minutes following application to the skin. A single application of a transdermal estradiol gel results in a sustained increase in estradiol levels for at least 24 hours. The apparent elimination half-life of estradiol with transdermal estradiol gel is 36 hours. Once daily application of 1.25 g topical gel containing 0.75 mg estradiol (brand name EstroGel) for 2 weeks was found to produce mean peak estradiol and estrone levels of 46.4 pg/mL and 64.2 pg/mL, respectively. The time-averaged levels of circulating estradiol and estrone with this formulation over the 24-hour dose interval were 28.3 pg/mL and 48.6 pg/mL, respectively. Levels of estradiol and estrone are stable and change relatively little over the course of the 24 hours following an application, indicating a long duration of action of this route. Steady-state levels of estradiol are achieved after 3 days of application. A higher dosage of estradiol gel containing 1.5 mg estradiol per daily application has been found to produce mean estradiol levels of 40 to 100 pg/mL and estrone levels of 90 pg/mL, while 3 mg per day has been found to result in respective mean estradiol and estrone levels of 60 to 140 pg/mL and 45 to 155 pg/mL. Topical estradiol gel at a dosage of 3 mg/day has been reported to be equipotent with 2 mg oral estradiol in terms of therapeutic effects and FSH suppression, as well as to produce similar estradiol levels. Transdermal estradiol gel produces an estradiol to estrone ratio of about 1:1. Transdermal estradiol gel can be used as a form of high-dose estrogen in transgender women. However, the doses needed require application to a large surface of skin that amounts to the combined area of both legs for proper absorption. As a result, high-dose transdermal estradiol gel is not a primary choice of estrogen therapy for most transgender individuals. Similarly to transdermal estradiol patches, high-dose transdermal estradiol gel has been studied in the treatment of prostate cancer as well. In these studies, levels of estradiol with estradiol gel or ointment were 84 pg/mL with 3 mg/day, 185 pg/mL with 6 mg/day, 107 pg/mL with 10 mg/day, and 473 pg/mL with 20 mg/day. Studies have found that topical application of estradiol to the breasts increases local levels of estradiol in breast tissue. The total endometrial proliferation dose of transdermal estradiol gel in women has been reported to be 150 mg per cycle or 14 days. However, it has also been found that 6 mg/day estradiol gel is effective for endometrial proliferation in women. Other transdermal formulations Estradiol is available in the form of transdermal emulsions and sprays as well. Estradiol emulsions and sprays are administered daily. Variability in pharmacokinetics Transdermal estradiol patches are described as delivering a fixed amount of estradiol such as 50 ¬µg/day or 100 ¬µg/day. However, there is large interindividual variability and intraindividual variability\`in the pharmacokinetic parameters of transdermal estradiol, and fluctuations in circulating estradiol levels with estradiol patches is almost as great as with oral estradiol. As such, the actual delivery rate of estradiol and mean levels of estradiol achieved with transdermal estradiol patches may be different from what is described and from the mean levels observed in clinical studies, respectively. A wide range of estradiol levels are measured in women using the same estradiol patch or gel and dosage, with an up to about 10-fold difference in levels. In a study of estradiol gel and patches, the maximal difference in peak levels between individuals was 11-fold for the gel and 7-fold for the patch, and the maximal difference in area- under-the-curve levels (total exposure) was 6-fold for the gel and 8-fold for the patch. It has likewise been reported that the interindividual variability in bioavailability with Estraderm reservoir patches ranges from 25 to 225%. In as many as 30% of women treated with a 50 ¬µg/day estradiol patch, estradiol levels are low. There are also significant short-term intraindividual differences in estradiol levels with estradiol patches; estradiol levels can fluctuate considerably from hour to hour. In addition, estradiol levels with estradiol patches are higher in the evening than in the morning, which may be due to circadian variations in skin blood flow that may influence absorption. In terms of area-under-the-curve levels of estradiol, the interindividual variability of transdermal estradiol has been found to be 20 to 44% using different transdermal formulations, and the intraindividual variability with transdermal estradiol has been found to be 20%. Factors which may contribute to inter- and intraindividual variability with transdermal estradiol include skin location and thickness; hair follicle density; solvent (alcohol) evaporation; skin dehydration, ambient temperature, and humidity; and reservoir size. =Vaginal administration= Vaginal estradiol is available in the forms of tablets, creams, inserts or suppositories, and rings. Vaginal estradiol tablets, creams, and inserts are usually administered once daily to twice weekly, whereas vaginal estradiol rings have a sustained action and are replaced once every 90 days. Vaginal estradiol can be used both as a systemic form of estradiol therapy, and at very low doses to selectively achieve a local vaginal effect without systemic effects, for instance in the treatment of menopausal symptoms such as vaginal atrophy and dryness. Vaginal estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed. The absorption of vaginal estradiol is slightly greater in women with vaginal atrophy. Vaginal estradiol has high bioavailability and greatly increased potency compared to oral estradiol, with about 10- to 20-fold the comparative potency of oral estradiol. The greater potency of vaginal estradiol relative to oral estradiol is due to the lack of the first pass associated with oral estradiol and due to low local metabolism of estradiol in the vagina. Because of the high estradiol levels achieved, LH and FSH are more strongly suppressed with vaginal estradiol than with other routes. A daily dosage of 0.5 mg vaginal micronized estradiol has been found to result in estradiol and estrone levels of 250 pg/mL and 130 pg/mL, respectively. Vaginal estradiol has a much higher estradiol-to-estrone ratio in comparison to oral estradiol. The average ratio of estradiol to estrone with vaginal estradiol is 5:1, compared to 1:5 in the case of oral estradiol, a 10-fold difference. As vaginal estradiol is not subject to a first pass and bypasses the intestines and liver, it does not affect liver protein synthesis at menopausal replacement dosages, similarly to transdermal estradiol. =Rectal administration= Estradiol levels with rectal administration of estradiol in women after a single 1 mg dose 3 hours post-dose, with 0.5 mg/day 6 hours after the last dose, and with 1 mg/day 6 hours after the last dose. Estradiol has been assessed for use by rectal administration in a number of studies. Uses of estradiol by this route have included treatment of menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women. Rectal administration of estradiol is described as qualitatively and quantitatively similar to vaginal administration of estradiol. The use of estradiol by the rectal route considerably bypasses the liver and hence the first-pass metabolism that occurs with oral estradiol, similarly to other parenteral routes of estradiol such as vaginal and transdermal administration. Irritation of the intestines does not usually occur with rectal estradiol. The use of estradiol by the rectal route is not well-accepted by all individuals, and due to its inconvenience, it has been said that rectal administration of estradiol has gained no practical clinical importance. Lauritzen (1986) reported that 3 hours after a single rectal dose of 1 mg micronized estradiol, estradiol levels increased by 620 pg/mL and estrone levels increased by 120 pg/mL. Subsequently, Lauritzen (1987, 1990) reported that 0.5 mg/day and 1 mg/day rectal estradiol resulted in respective estradiol levels of 363 pg/mL and 515 pg/mL 6 hours following the last dose. These estradiol levels are fairly similar to those achieved by vaginal estradiol. The estradiol-to-estrone ratio of rectal estradiol is about 5:1, which likewise is the same as that of vaginal estradiol. Absorption of rectal estradiol occurs rapidly within 30 to 60 minutes, maximal estradiol levels occur at 3 hours post-dose, and circulating estradiol levels are reportedly maintained for 4 to 10 hours. The duration of rectal estradiol is said to necessitate repeated administration 1 to 2 times per day. Rectal administration of estriol, which has similar properties to estradiol, has also been studied. Administration of a rectal suppository containing 100 mg estriol resulted in estriol levels in pregnant women at term increasing by about 53%. Estriol levels at term are normally between 5,000 and 20,000 pg/mL, which suggests that estriol levels may have increased following the suppository by about 5,000 to 10,000 pg/mL (precise levels were not provided). =Intramuscular injection= Intramuscular injections are injections into muscle, for instance the gluteal or deltoid muscle. Estradiol and estradiol esters can be administered in a variety of forms by intramuscular injection. Aqueous solutions of estradiol and estradiol esters by intramuscular injection have a rapid onset and duration analogously to but slightly more delayed than intravenous injection. However, intramuscular injections of oil solutions, crystalline aqueous suspensions, and emulsions of estradiol and estradiol esters, as well as solutions and suspensions of estradiol polymers and estradiol microspheres, act as long- lasting depot injections. Estradiol esters, including but not limited to estradiol benzoate, estradiol valerate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol enanthate, and estradiol undecylate, are inactive prodrugs of estradiol that are converted into estradiol in the body. The aforementioned estradiol esters are fatty acid esters and are more lipophilic (fat-soluble) than estradiol. More lipophilic compounds are absorbed more slowly from the injection site when given by depot intramuscular injection (as oil solutions, aqueous suspensions, and emulsions), and hence more lipophilic estradiol esters have longer durations than free estradiol or less lipophilic estradiol esters via this route. Polyestradiol phosphate is a polymer of the hydrophilic (water- soluble) estradiol ester estradiol phosphate which circulates in the blood but is metabolized into estradiol very slowly. The bioavailability of estradiol and estradiol esters given by intramuscular injection is said to be essentially complete. For comparison, the bioavailability of oral estradiol is around 5%. The estradiol levels that result with typical clinical doses of estradiol and estradiol esters by intramuscular injection tend to be high compared to the typical estradiol levels that occur with other clinically used routes and forms of estradiol. Aqueous solutions Aqueous solutions are solutions of a compound with water. In contrast to other formulations, such as oil solutions, aqueous suspensions, and emulsions, aqueous solutions of estradiol and estradiol esters by intramuscular injection are not depot injections. Instead, they are rapidly absorbed and eliminated, analogously to intravenous injections of estradiol and estradiol esters. The durations of aqueous solutions of estradiol and estradiol esters by intramuscular injection are measured in hours. Oil solutions Oil solutions are solutions of a compound with oil, for instance sesame oil or castor oil. When free steroids like estradiol are administered in oil solution by intramuscular injection, they are rapidly absorbed and the duration is relatively short. A single 1 to 2 mg dose of estradiol in oil solution by intramuscular injection has a duration of about 1 or 2 days. Little prolongation of duration is achieved with the use of larger doses. Nonetheless, the duration of estradiol in oil solution by intramuscular injection is significantly longer than an intravenous injection of estradiol or estradiol valerate, which show a duration of only a few hours. Conversely, intramuscular injections of estradiol esters in oil solution have durations of days to months, depending on the ester administered. Following a single 4 or 5 mg intramuscular injection in oil solution, peak estradiol levels are about 950 pg/mL with estradiol benzoate after 2 days, 400 to 650 pg/mL with estradiol valerate after 2 days, and 250 to 350 pg/mL with estradiol cypionate after 4 days. The durations with a 5 mg dose are 4 or 5 days with estradiol benzoate, 7 or 8 days with estradiol valerate, and 11 to 14 days with estradiol cypionate. The differences in estradiol levels and the different durations with estradiol levels are due to their different rates of release from the oily depot at the injection site. The longer and hence more lipophilic the fatty acid ester, the slower the release from the depot, the lower the peak estradiol levels, and the longer the duration. The duration of estradiol esters in oil solution by intramuscular injection is dose-dependent. With estradiol valerate, it is reported that a dose of 5 mg has a duration of 7 to 8 days, 10 mg a duration of 10 to 14 days, 40 mg a duration of 2 to 3 weeks, and 100 mg a duration of 3 to 4 weeks. High doses of estradiol valerate, such as 40 mg per week, can achieve pregnancy levels of estradiol. A study of pseudopregnancy with intramuscular injections of 40 mg/week estradiol valerate and 250 mg/week hydroxyprogesterone caproate observed estradiol levels of about 2,500 to 3,000 pg/mL. Aqueous suspensions Aqueous suspensions are suspensions of crystal particles a compound in water. Estradiol in microcrystalline aqueous suspension for use by intramuscular injection was previously marketed in the 1950s under brand names such as Aquadiol, Diogyn, Progynon Aqueous Suspension, and Progynon Micropellets. It was used at a dose of 0.5 to 1.5 mg 2 or 3 times per week. Newman (1950) found that 0.5 to 2 mg once per week was satisfactory. As such, the preparation presumably had a duration in the range of 2 to 7 days. Microcrystalline aqueous suspensions of estradiol esters, for instance of estradiol benzoate (brand names Agofollin Depot alone and Follivirin in combination with testosterone isobutyrate),https://web.archive.org/web/20190519104654/http://www.sukl.cz/download/pil/PI16221.pdfhttp://www.sukl.cz/download/pil/PI15789.pdf have been found to have longer duration of actions than oil solutions of the same esters when administered via intramuscular injection. Whereas the duration of a single intramuscular injection of amorphous estradiol benzoate in oil solution is 6 days, the duration of a single intramuscular injection of microcrystalline estradiol benzoate in aqueous suspension is 16 to 21 days. The duration of crystalline aqueous suspensions is highly dependent on crystal size. Steroids and steroid fatty acid esters are lipophilic and have very low water solubility. When they are suspended in the form of crystals in water, these crystals dissolve slowly, releasing steroid from their surfaces in the process. The larger the particle sizes of the crystals, the slower the dissolution rate. When a crystalline aqueous suspension of steroid is administered via intramuscular injection, a crystalline depot suspended in fluid is formed locally within the muscle. These crystals slowly dissolve and the steroid is gradually absorbed into the body, resulting in the long durations of such preparations. Particle sizes of 10 Œºm or less have no apparent depot effect. A larger needle size is needed for aqueous suspensions of steroids to allow the steroid crystals to pass through the needle lumen. Aqueous suspensions pose a risk of injection site reactions such as local irritation, swelling, and redness, with often severe pain. The reactions are worse with larger crystal sizes. Particle sizes of more than 300 Œºm in the case of estradiol benzoate have been found to be too painful for use. The local injection site reactions, which do not occur with oil solutions, have limited the clinical use of aqueous suspensions of estradiol and its esters as well as other steroids. Emulsions Emulsions are mixtures of immiscible liquids. Water-in-oil emulsions of estradiol benzoate were evaluated as long- acting preparations for use by intramuscular injection in the 1940s and 1950s. Formulations of estradiol benzoate alone under the brand name Menformon- Emulsion and with progesterone under the brand name Di-Pro-Emulsion were previously marketed. A 10 mg dose of estradiol benzoate in emulsion by intramuscular injection is said to have a duration of about 2 to 3 weeks. This is similar to the duration of an aqueous suspension of 10 mg estradiol benzoate or an oil solution of 10 mg estradiol valerate. Emulsions of steroids by intramuscular injection have similar properties (e.g., duration) relative to aqueous suspensions. Painful injection site reactions have been reported with emulsions similarly to suspensions. Polymers Polymers are large molecules of repeating subunits. Polyestradiol phosphate (brand name Estradurin) is a water-soluble estradiol ester in the form of a polymer and a very slowly hydrolyzed prodrug of estradiol. It is formulated as an aqueous solution and is given by intramuscular injection. The medication has an exceptionally long duration of action, with an elimination half-life of about 70 days or 10 weeks following a single injection. Estradiol levels during polyestradiol phosphate therapy are very constant and uniform. Levels of estradiol after 6 months of treatment with polyestradiol phosphate were about 350, 450, and 650 pg/mL with doses of 160, 240, and 320 mg once per month, respectively. Polyestradiol phosphate has mostly been discontinued and remains available only in a few countries. Microspheres Microspheres are microscopic spherical particles which can be used to encapsulate compounds. Estradiol is available in the form of an aqueous suspension of 1.0 mg estradiol in microspheres for use by intramuscular injection once a month under the brand name Juvenum E in Mexico. It achieves circulating estradiol levels of 163 pg/mL to 219 pg/mL in the first 3 to 12 hours following injection, which decrease to 42 to 66 pg/mL during the first 4 days post- injection and to 20 to 35 pg/mL after 8 days, with levels remaining in this range thereafter over 30 days. These estradiol levels are similar to the normal levels that occur during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women (24 to 75 pg/mL). The elimination of the formulation follows three phases: a rapid phase in the first 2 days, a second phase during days 2 to 12 days with a biological half-life of 7 to 10 days, and a third phase in which estradiol levels remain elevated above baseline for up to 30 days. =Subcutaneous injection= Estradiol esters like estradiol valerate and estradiol cypionate can be given by subcutaneous injection instead of intramuscular injection. Subcutaneous and intramuscular injection of estradiol cypionate in an aqueous suspension has been found to result in levels of estradiol and other pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., duration) that were virtually identical. Studies have shown that subcutaneous injection of closely related steroid esters in oil like the androgen esters testosterone cypionate, testosterone enantate, and nandrolone decanoate is effective and has similar pharmacokinetics to intramuscular injection as well. In addition, studies have found that many intramuscular injections are really subcutaneous injections, as individuals often do not actually penetrate deep enough to inject into muscle when attempting to perform an intramuscular injection and instead inject into the subcutaneous fat layer above the muscle. This is particularly prevalent with injections into the buttocks and in overweight and obese individuals, due to the thicker layer of fat over muscle. Subcutaneous injections of estradiol esters may be easier and less painful to perform than intramuscular injections, and hence may result in improved compliance and satisfaction with therapy. =Subcutaneous implantation= Estradiol can be administered in a very long-lasting form via subcutaneous implantation of pure crystalline estradiol compressed into a small solid cylindrical pellet. These pellets slowly and completely dissolve and are replaced once every 6 to 12 months, achieving high and very constant circulating levels of estradiol. They are surgically inserted with the aid of a trocar by a trained physician in a medical office or clinic, and can be placed into locations including the lower abdomen, lower back, buttocks, or hips. Subcutaneous pellets containing 20 mg estradiol (brand name Meno-Implant) or 25, 50, or 100 mg estradiol (brand name Estradiol Implants; discontinued) for replacement usually once every 6 months (range 4 to 8 months) are or have been available as approved pharmaceutical medications. Up to 800 mg estradiol per implantation has been used. Pharmaceutical estradiol pellet implants have been used almost exclusively in the United Kingdom, but have also been available in Australia and the Netherlands. However, estradiol pellets have been discontinued in both the United Kingdom and Australia. An estradiol implant has not been approved by the FDA as a pharmaceutical medication in the United States, but hormone pellet implants, including estradiol pellets, are available as custom compounded products in this country. Estradiol pellet implants are advantageous in that some women seem to need higher levels of estradiol for adequate relief of menopausal symptoms, and subcutaneous estradiol pellets are easily able to achieve such levels. Conversely, this is not necessarily the case with oral or transdermal estradiol. Another major advantage of estradiol pellet implants is convenience and guaranteed compliance. They also do not have the issues pertaining to first-pass metabolism and liver protein synthesis of oral estradiol. A major disadvantage of estradiol pellet implants is that they cannot be easily removed should this be necessary. There are also concerns about accumulation of estradiol levels with long-term repeated pellet implantation. Estradiol levels may remain above baseline for a year or in some cases 3 to 4 years following the last pellet insertion. During this time, progestogen therapy should be continued to avoid the risk of endometrial changes. Regular monitoring of estradiol levels and adjustment of dosing is recommended during therapy with estradiol pellet implants. Tachyphylaxis of relief of vasomotor symptoms, or hot flashes returning even with normal or supraphysiological estradiol levels, may occur in a small subset of cases with estradiol pellet implants. The reason for this is unknown, but has been hypothesized to be a paradoxical effect of the high levels of estradiol achieved and/or a result of receptor desensitization caused by the long-term gradually decreasing levels of estradiol. Such symptoms have been said to occur once estradiol levels begin to decrease, although there are also reports of such symptoms occurring 3 to 16 weeks (1 to 4 months) after pellet insertion, when estradiol levels should still be constant. Hot flashes have notably been reported in pregnant women, who have very high and constantly increasing levels of estradiol. When recurrence of hot flashes occurs with estradiol pellets, treated women often complain that their pellet has \\"run out\\". Such symptoms can be temporarily offset with the use of supplemental oral or transdermal estradiol. Following insertion of an estradiol pellet, levels of estradiol rapidly increase, remain constant for about 4 months, and then gradually decrease. A 25 mg subcutaneous estradiol pellet has been found to result in average estradiol levels of 90 pg/mL for 6 months, while two 25 mg pellets (50 mg total) resulted in estradiol levels of 180 pg/mL after 24 hours and levels of 100 to 120 pg/mL for 6 months. Higher-dose pellets resulted in estradiol levels for 50 mg of 100 pg/mL, for 75 mg of 140 pg/mL, and for 100 mg of 150 pg/mL. Estradiol levels are generally 50% higher than those of estrone, for an estradiol-to-estrone ratio of 1.5:1. Very high levels of estradiol of between 400 and 1,000 pg/mL have been observed in a small subset of women treated with estradiol pellets and notably in those experiencing symptoms of tachyphylaxis. Estradiol pellet implants have been studied in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. =Intrauterine administration= Intrauterine estradiol has been studied in the treatment of uterine hypoplasia in women. =Intravenous injection= The administration of estradiol by intravenous injection has been studied. It achieves extremely high peak levels of estradiol but has a very short duration. Kuhnz et al. (1993) reported that a single intravenous injection of 0.3 mg estradiol resulted in peak estradiol concentrations of 8,321 pg/mL at 5 minutes post- injection. Estradiol levels decreased to 1,628 pg/mL after 30 minutes, to 778 pg/mL after 1 hour, and to 23 pg/mL after 6 hours. Leyendecker et al. (1975) reported that a single intravenous injection of 20 mg estradiol resulted in estradiol levels of 2,950 pg/mL at 12 hours after the injection (earlier time points were not measured). Following this, estradiol levels decreased to around 400 pg/mL by 24 hours post-injection and reached near-baseline levels of 45 pg/mL after 48 hours. The ratio of estradiol to estrone is very high initially (e.g., around 10:1 at peak) but becomes smaller as estradiol levels decline. The distribution half-life of intravenous estradiol is about 6 minutes and the terminal half-life of intravenous estradiol is about 0.5 to 2 hours. The peak estradiol levels are far higher and the duration far shorter when estradiol is given by intravenous injection than when estradiol esters are administered by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection. The administration of estradiol valerate by intravenous injection has been studied as well. It has been found to be very rapidly cleaved into estradiol in the blood. The metabolism of estradiol valerate does not differ with intravenous versus intramuscular injection. While estradiol itself has not been used clinically by intravenous injection, certain estrogen preparations such as conjugated estrogens and estramustine phosphate are available in formulations indicated for intravenous injection. Both of these medications act in part as prodrugs of estradiol. The intravenous formulation of conjugated estrogens is available at a dose of 25 mg per injection and is used in the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding due to its ability to rapidly and temporarily enhance coagulation. It has also been used off-label to treat severe bleeding after hysteroscopic metroplasty and as an emergency contraceptive.https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2017/010402s068lbl.pdf The formulation is given in a single injection but can be repeated after 6 to 12 hours if necessary. Intravenous estramustine phosphate has a relatively long duration and, like oral estramustine phosphate, is used in the treatment of prostate cancer. Estramustine phosphate was initially introduced as an intravenous formulation and was only later introduced as an oral medication. Following introduction of the more convenient oral formulation, intravenous estramustine phosphate has largely been abandoned. The administration of large doses of estrogens intravenously has been studied. General =Absorption= Estradiol is well-absorbed regardless of route of administration. However, the bioavailability of estradiol differs substantially with different routes of administration. Oral estradiol has an average bioavailability of around 5%, requiring relatively high dosages of estradiol for effects. Estradiol administered in the form of an ester by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection has complete bioavailability. =Distribution= Estradiol is rapidly distributed throughout the body, with a distribution phase of about 6 minutes following intravenous injection. Estradiol is taken up into cells via passive diffusion due to its lipophilicity. Due to binding to the ERs, estradiol is preferentially concentrated in tissues with the highest ER content. In animals, these tissues have included the uterus, vagina, mammary glands, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, other brain regions, adipose tissue, liver, and adrenal glands, among other tissues. In contrast to estradiol, due to its low affinities for the ERs, estrone is not accumulated in target tissues. Estradiol has been found to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier in rhesus monkeys. The volume of distribution of estradiol has been found to be 0.85 to 1.17 L/kg. In another study however, its volume of distribution was only 0.082 ¬± 0.015 L/kg (4.8 L in women of average weight 58.4 kg). In terms of plasma protein binding, estradiol is bound loosely to albumin and tightly to SHBG, with approximately 97 to 98% of estradiol bound to plasma proteins. In the circulation, approximately 38% of estradiol is bound to SHBG and 60% is bound to albumin, with 2 to 3% free or unbound. However, with oral estradiol, there is an increase in hepatic SHBG production and hence SHBG levels (e.g., +50%), and this results in a relatively reduced fraction of free estradiol. As only free estradiol that is not bound to plasma proteins or SHBG is biologically active, this may reduce the potency of oral estradiol by some degree. However, a study found that the free fraction of estradiol was similar with doses of oral and topical estradiol that resulted in equivalent total estradiol levels. =Metabolism= There are several major pathways of estradiol metabolism, which occur both in the liver and in other tissues: * Dehydrogenation by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17Œ≤-HSD) into estrone * Conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases and UDP-glucuronyltransferases into C3 and/or C17Œ≤ estrogen conjugates like estrone sulfate and estradiol glucuronide * Hydroxylation by cytochrome P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 into catechol estrogens like 2-hydroxyestrone and 2-hydroxyestradiol as well as 16-hydroxylated estrogens like 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone and estriol (16Œ±-hydroxyestradiol) The liver is almost entirely responsible for metabolism of estradiol. Both dehydrogenation of estradiol by 17Œ≤-HSD into estrone and conjugation into estrogen conjugates are reversible transformations. However, in regards to sulfation and desulfation, transformation of estrone into estrone sulfate is predominant relative to the reverse reaction. Estradiol can also be reversibly converted into long-lived lipoidal estradiol forms like estradiol palmitate and estradiol stearate as a minor route of metabolism. The elimination half-life of estradiol administered via intravenous injection has been found to be 2 hours in men and 27 to 50 minutes in women. Other routes of administration of estradiol like oral administration or intramuscular injection have far longer elimination half-lives and durations of action due to (1) the formation of a large circulating reservoir of metabolism-resistant estrogen conjugates that can be reconverted back into estradiol and/or (2) the formation of slowly-releasing depots. The metabolic clearance rates of estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate are 580 L/day/m2, 1,050 L/day/m2, and 80 L/day/m2, respectively. =Elimination= A single dose of oral estradiol valerate is eliminated 54% in urine and 6% in feces. A substantial amount of estradiol is also excreted in bile. The urinary metabolites of estradiol are predominantly present in the form of estrogen conjugates, including glucuronides and, to a lesser extent, sulfates. The main metabolites of estradiol in urine are estrone glucuronide (13‚Äì30%), 2-hydroxyestrone (2.6‚Äì10.1%), unchanged estradiol (5.2‚Äì7.5%), estriol (2.0‚Äì5.9%), and 16Œ±-hydroxyestrone (1.0‚Äì2.9%). Following an intravenous injection of labeled estradiol in women, almost 90% is excreted in urine and feces within 4 to 5 days. Enterohepatic recirculation causes a delay in excretion of estradiol.

Welsh (1909-1969) was an official of the United States federal government, best known for serving as the Executive Secretary to the National Aeronautics and Space Council (NASC) during the John F. Kennedy presidential administration. Prior to his appointment he had served as an adviser to Kennedy's Democratic rival in the presidential campaign Senator Stuart Symington on space-related issues.John F. Kennedy and the Race to the Moon Following Symington's elimination in the party primary, JFK's advisers borrowed space and defense-related content Welsh had developed for Symington in order to fend off an aggressive stance by the Republican candidate Richard M. Nixon. An important instance appeared under Kennedy's name in the October 10, 1961, edition of Cold War-era important trade publication Missiles and Rockets magazine.Cooperating with the Soviets in Space It included the stirring charge: > \\"We are in a strategic space race with the Russians, and we are > losing....Control of space will be decided in the next decade. If the > Soviets control space they can control earth, as in centuries past the > nation that controlled the seas dominated the continents...We cannot run > second in this vital race. To insure peace and freedom we must be first.\\" This shortly morphed in Kennedy's advisers' hands into his infamous \\"Missile Gap\\" speech of October 18, 1960,Speech of Senator John F. Kennedy, American Legion Convention, Miami Beach, Florida, October 18, 1960 wherein the then United States senator exaggeratedly claimed the Soviet Union was far ahead of the U.S. in developing missiles with nuclear warheads rather than the U.S. holding a distinct superiority. Shortly into his tenure as head of NASA Welsh drafted an amendment to the 1961 Space Act at Kennedy's behest that made the vice president instead of the president chairman of the National Space Council. Lyndon B. Johnson then assumed an important role in the long and difficult task of finding someone willing to serve as NASA administrator in an environment of uncertainty and ambiguity. Johnson immediately spearheaded the effort that recommended a lunar landing and return as the best way to beat the Soviets in space, resulting in the forging of the strong relationship with that agency he maintained throughout his presidency. Secure in office Kennedy began to backtrack on his hawkish campaign rhetoric on expanding the role of defense in space, while embracing the civilian space exploration program and its lunar ambitions. Indicating this shift regarding the militarization of space, Kennedy strongly insisted in a May 1961 memorandum to Welsh, then still his top space administrator, that the president be advised beforehand of any effort to launch any systems involving nuclear power into space.National Security Memorandum No. 50, May 12, 1961 Welsh left his role in the Executive prior to Johnson commencing his elected term as president in January 1964.

During a storyline where the main character Ethan and his fianc√©e Lilah are expecting their first child, the strip‚Äîpresented as a four- panel comic with no dialogue‚Äîhas Ethan entering a hospital, asking a receptionist for directions, talking to a doctor, and finding Lilah crying on her side in a hospital bed, implying that she had suffered a miscarriage. Buckley cited personal events in his life as inspiration for the comic. Since the publication of the strip, it has garnered negative reception from critics and webcomic creators, noting the shift in tone in the webcomic as an example of \\"fridging\\". It later garnered a legacy as an internet meme, with edits to the strip being made by other creators. Background Ctrl+Alt+Del, abbreviated to \\"CAD\\", is a webcomic series by Tim Buckley. Created in October 2002, the comic focuses on characters Ethan and Lucas, and later Ethan's love interest Lilah. In 2008, during a storyline where Ethan and Lilah were expecting their first child, Buckley posted the strip \\"Loss\\". Before releasing the strip, Buckley wrote a blog post, explaining that he had planned the storyline years in advance. He also mentioned personal experience in his life inspired the strip, mentioning an unplanned pregnancy and miscarriage with an ex-girlfriend in college. Reception Penny Arcade creators Mike Krahulik (left) and Jerry Holkins (right) criticized Tim Buckley on \\"Loss\\". \\"Loss\\" was received negatively by webcomic creators and critics. During the 2008 Penny Arcade Expo, creators of the event and webcomic series Penny Arcade Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins were asked about the strip during an interview with Joystiq. Both men criticized it, with Holkins describing Buckley as the \\"Antichrist\\", humorously citing \\"Loss\\" and its storyline as the first horseman of the Apocalypse. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw, creator of the video game review series Zero Punctuation, referenced Ctrl+Alt+Del in his episode on video game webcomics, where he mentioned that having a story line where a character miscarries in a webcomic known for humor would be considered \\"an awkward tonal shift at best and hugely disrespectful of the subject matter at worst\\". Kotaku's Mike Fahey, formerly a self-declared fan of the webcomic, agreed with Croshaw's complaints, mentioning being unable to read the series like he used to. The strip has also faced criticism for being an example of \\"fridging\\", a term coined by the website Women in Refrigerators where an author uses the trauma of a female character as a plot device often in a male character's story. Buckley later stated, in the event the situation was brought up again in the webcomic, he would do more research on the effects miscarriages have on mothers. Legacy A minimalist version of \\"Loss\\", consisting only of seven lines Since the strip was first published in 2008, it has become an internet meme, with users from sites such as 4chan and Tumblr creating edits of the strip, such as recreating it using scenes from other works such as Futurama and Pok√©mon. 4chan's video game board /v/ would later ban users who created new threads about these edits. A minimalist version of the meme involves the sequence in the same four-panel style; first panel with a single vertical line, second panel with two vertical lines, the second line slightly shorter, third panel with two equal vertical lines, and the fourth panel with a vertical line and a horizontal line. Seeing this sequence would usually cause the reply, \\"Is this Loss?\\" New York Magazine Brian Feldman declared it as \\"the Internet's Longest-Running Miscarriage 'Joke. Aryehi Bhushan from student newspaper Varsity wrote about \\"Loss\\" as a meme, praising its longevity compared to other memes that have short lifespans. In 2016, the podcast Reply All discussed the strip during their eightieth episode, Flash!, where a variant of \\"Loss\\" was used as a joke about the results in the 2016 United States presidential election. On June 2, 2018, the tenth anniversary of \\"Loss\\", the original strip was replaced by an edit of the comic titled \\"Found\\". While the first three panels remained the same, in the last panel Ethan instead looks at the audience with a smirk on his face. A day later, the original strip was restored with no explanation for the replacement. Julia Alexander from Polygon considered \\"Found\\" to be an acknowledgement of the status \\"Loss\\" had achieved as a meme, comparing the evolution of the strip to Pepe the Frog. On June 2, 2019, for the eleventh anniversary, the strip was replaced once again by an edit of the comic titled \\"Cross\\". Like \\"Found\\", this edit replaced the last panel with one where the birth was successful, however the child's face is a minimalist version of the comic itself. Unlike the previous year, this edit did not receive much attention.

In 1940 Rockingham went overseas as a Lieutenant with the Canadian Scottish Regiment, but after the Dieppe Raid of August 1942 he was transferred to the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and promoted to Major. Following the Invasion of Normandy in June 1944, Rockingham played a significant role in Operation Overlord and the North West Europe Campaign both as Commanding Officer of the RHLI and as General Officer Commanding of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade. Rockingham returned to civilian life in 1946, obtaining a job with the British Columbia Electric Railway. However, in 1950 he was recalled by the military to command the Canadian Army Special Force in the Korean War. After his stint as Brigadier-General in Korea ended, Rockingham returned to Canada where he remained in the military until 1966. Rockingham died in British Columbia in 1987 at age 75.  Biography  = Early life = John Meredith Rockingham was born in Sydney, New South Wales on 24 August 1911 to Walter Edward Rockingham (1877‚Äì1966) and Ethel Vincent Meredith Rockingham (1882‚Äì1941). Walter Rockingham worked for the Pacific Cable Board and took his family with him as he traveled world laying telegraph lines. In 1919 the Rockinghams moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where John Meredith stayed for two years before returning to Australia. In 1926 the family moved to Barbados, staying for two years. Following this the family moved to England, then back to Australia. In Australia Rockingham completed his Sixth Form at the Melbourne Grammar School, and subsequently enrolled in the University of Melbourne. After he ran out of money, Rockingham quit university and worked as a Jackaroo. Having retired, Walter purchased a piece of land at Millstream, British Columbia, on which he began a sheep farm. In 1930 John joined his parents in Canada, this time staying for good. He worked on the sheep farm for three years before enlisting in the Canadian Army. = Enlistment = While working on the sheep farm Rockingham had played rugby for the Canadian Scottish Regiment in Victoria. Additionally, he rowed for the James Bay Athletic Association. In 1933 he enlisted in the regiment's 1st Battalion as a Private, but was quickly commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Rockingham served with the militia until 1939 and lived at the Bay Street Armoury. In these pre-war years Rockingham spent his time in a machine gun platoon. During this time he also worked for the British Columbia Electric Railway. On 11 January 1936 Rockingham married Mary Carlyle Hammond (1912-1997) of Winnipeg, Manitoba. Rockingham had met Hammond when she was giving the highland dance lessons that were mandatory for all officers in the Canadian Scottish. = World War II = When war broke out in September 1939, the regiment was mobilized and assigned to protect vital areas around the city. In 1940 the regiment's 1st Battalion was selected to go overseas. Rockingham had recently been made a Captain, but was told that if he wanted to go with the battalion he would have to revert to his previous rank of Lieutenant, which he elected to do. The battalion traveled to Halifax from where sailed to Glasgow, and soon after arrival they transferred to Aldershot. There, Rockingham was appointed commander of a guard of honour for King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, who visited that December. He was later sent to the Canadian company command school. Rockingham was at the school when Canada undertook the Dieppe Raid on 19 August 1942. A significant portion of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry was killed during this raid, and Rockingham was subsequently transferred to the depleted regiment as a Major. Stationed on the south coast of England as part of the anti-invasion force, on 14 April 1943 Rockingham was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and made Commanding Officer of the regiment. On 19 February 1944, Rockingham was relived of his command and sent to the Staff College, Camberley for further training. Following the Invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, the RHLI went to France without Rockingham. However, their CO was soon wounded. Rockingham was removed from the Staff College, and on 18 July given command of the Regiment once more and sent to France. In July 1944 the RHLI was stationed near Caen. Rockingham fought with the regiment as it moved south towards Verri√®res. For his actions during the Battle of Verri√®res Ridge on 24 and 25 July, Rockingham was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. In August he was again removed from the RHLI, and this time promoted to Brigadier and on 8 August made General Officer Commanding of the 9th Canadian Infantry Brigade. As GOC his first conflict with the 9th was the Battle of the Falaise Pocket from 12 to 21 August. In September 1944 he accepted the German surrender at Boulogne-sur-Mer after Operation Wellhit. In February 1945 Rockingham's brigade was placed under command of the 51st (Highland) Division in anticipation of the Rhine Crossing. For his part in the crossing he received his second DSO. Rockingham was in Emden, Germany on VE Day. = Inter-war period = Following his demobilization, Rockingham returned to civilian life in 1946. He settled again in Victoria where he found work with his pre-war employer, the BC Electric Railway. His first position was as a personnel supervisor, however, in 1949 he transferred to Vancouver where he was promoted to Staff Assistant to the General Manager of Transportation. In early 1950 he became the company's superintendent. = Korea = On 7 August 1950 while in his Vancouver office, Rockingham received a telephone call from Brooke Claxton, Minister of National Defence in Louis St. Laurent's Liberal government. Claxton offered Rockingham the opportunity to command a Canadian brigade that the government had decided to send into the Korean War. Rockingham accepted the appointment and prepared to go overseas with the new Brigade, called the Canadian Army Special Force (CASF), under the command of the United Nations. The brigade trained at Fort Lewis in Washington before travelling to Korea. Rockingham commanded the Brigade until 10 April 1952, when Mortimer Patrick Bogert took over command. = Later military career = In April 1952 Rockingham returned to Ottawa to the National Defence Headquarters. For the remainder of his military career Rockingham served as a staff officer in the Canadian Army. In 1953 he took command of the 3rd Canadian Infantry Brigade, in 1954 the 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade, in 1957 Quebec Command, and in 1961 Western Command Edmonton. In 1954 he was promoted to Major-General. Rockingham retired from the military in 1966, and that same year was made Honorary Colonel of the Canadian Scottish. = Retirement and final years = In his later years Rockingham served as a volunteer for various organizations. He was at various times a member of the Canadian Olympic Committee, a counselor for the Canada West Foundation, Honorary Chairman of the Canadian National Ski Team, and Director of the Vancouver Island Colleges Foundation. John and Mary had two children: John Robert Meredith and Audrey Vincent. He died in Qualicum Beach, British Columbia on 7 July 1987 at age 75.

History  Founded as the Expositor in the days immediately after the Civil War, the paper was renamed the Democrat after a purchase and 1868 relaunch by Union veterans George Cozad and James W. Woffindin with the masthead motto \\"The government is best which governs least.\\" After other state papers named themselves \\"The Democrat\\" the paper added the \\"Weston\\" to its name for clarification. Cozad had left the paper in 1870, but Woffindin stayed on, despite his growing unease with the Democratic party the paper supported. In 1875, Woffindin broke with the party and with the paper. Thomas A. Edwards, a local judge, bought the four page paper, and reasserted its Democratic principles. The paper was bought by former Democrat employee Harrison and Robert Bland, although the latter sold his interest after a short period. Thomas Edwards, though selling the paper to Harrison, would remain editor until his death in 1900. As publisher, Harrison expanded the publication schedule and changed the style of the paper, to the acclaim of the neighboring Weekly Register, which proclaimed \\"it is now a very creditable journal, and the Register wishes The Weston Democrat Publishing Company, R H. Harrison, manager, abundant success.\\" Harrison, however, was done with the paper, selling it in 1904 to the eldest son of Thomas Edwards. The paper was sold to Robert Billeter in 1985. Billeter made many improvements, including moving to electronic production and launching the paper's first website in 1999. He retired in 2016 at the age of 90, selling the business to Weston Publishing.

Grete Diercks Berlin 1912 - Restored Biography Diercks had been active since childhood as an actress at the 1900 Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. On her 11th birthday, she became a member of the ensemble there and regularly appeared on stage between the seasons of 1902-1903 to 1908-1909. Although she had never attended a formal acting school, she remained dedicated to the theater as a young woman. Through her work in 1912 at the theater in Riga, she gathered further acting experience. In Riga, she also met her future husband, an engineer. Then she went to Berlin, where she took on various theater engagements, including roles in the theater in the K√∂niggr√§tzer street in 1917. Diercks was not only active as a theater actress, but occasionally appeared as a singer, appearing circa 1914 in the title role in the operetta Prinzessin Herzlieb by Eduard M√∂rike. The cinema gained importance in Diercks' artistic career only towards the end of World War I, and she was cast in a series of minor, supporting, and leading roles in a number of German productions, including Ernst Lubitsch's Carmen and Rausch and F. W. Murnau's Der brennende Acker and E. A. Dupont's first adaptation of the popular high-alpine drama Die Geierwally. She meanwhile continued to act in live theater performances, appearing in 1918 at the comedy house in Melchior Lengyel and Lajos B√≠r√≥'s play Die Zarin and 1921 at the Berlin Lustspielhaus in Angelo Cana's Der Werwolf. Her last film was Die Sonne von St. Moritz from 1923. In the same year, she married, and she ended her acting career.

It sank in 1633 carrying a large amount of royal treasure and its wreck has still to be found. History In 1626, the ferry was granted Letters of Marque, a licence to attack or capture enemy vessels during the Thirty Years' War.Lavery, p. 5. =Sinking= The ferry capsized during a storm on 10 July 1633.Farrington, p. 35. Only two of its thirty-five passengers and crew survived. It was also carrying 20 carts of jewels, plate and textiles belonging to Charles I,Happer and Steward, p. 104. which included, among other valuable objects, a 280-piece silver dinner service commissioned by Henry VIII.Saari, et al., p. 51. Charles, undertaking an official tour of Scotland after his coronation there, had been staying at his hunting lodge in Falkland. He watched the ferry sink from the deck of his flagship, the Dreadnought. He blamed a coven of witches, who were put on trial and executed in Lancashire. The royal cargo, of between four and five tons of gold and silver, was estimated to be worth ¬£100,000 at the time,Happer and Steward, p. 105. US$400 million in 1997, and ¬£500 million in 1999. Attempts to find the wreck Marine archaeologists have long searched for the wreck, but it has never been found, not least because 500 other vessels lie at the bottom of the Firth of Forth.Saari, et al., p. 54. An eight-year search by the Burntisland Heritage Trust and the Royal Navy began in 1991. The Trust intended to open a museum in Burntisland exhibiting any artefacts that could be salvaged from the Blessing. After finding 200 possible wreck sites within a two-mile area of the estuary, one wreck was closely inspected in 1993, and divers found pottery, shoe leather and bolts dating from the 1600s. The search ended in 1999 with HMS Roebuck discovering a wreck off the coast of Burntisland. Divers were sent below the waves to verify the computerised survey images, and the Secretary of State for Scotland gave the site legal protection to keep treasure hunters at bay.

Characterized as a \\"legendary Chicano activist\\" and a \\"political trailblazer\\" by Austin newspapers, he led the way for Latinos to follow him into public office. As a Travis County Commissioner, Moya helped to reform county services and hiring practices, opening doors for minorities. He was instrumental in bringing county government into the modern era. Later Moya served at the state level where he continued his push for better government. Youth Moya was born in Austin, Texas to Pete and Bertha Ramos Moya, and was raised in East Austin, a Mexican American barrio at that time. In 1942 the family settled into a house in East Austin after Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church moved there. Initially he was enrolled in Zavala elementary, \\"the Mexican School\\". When the family moved close to Metz elementary, the school for white children, Bertha Moya confronted the segregation of Mexican- American students. She insisted he attend Metz, in spite of expectations. At that time the boundaries for the two schools were identical, but Zavala was considered the Mexican School. Referring to Metz, Moya said \\"They were maybe six or seven Hispanics in the whole school. My sister and I never went outside for recess‚Äù. This early experience established Moya's determination to defend the underdog. After Allen Junior High he attended Austin High School, where he and his friends published the Blah, Blah, and Blah, because Mexican American coverage was excluded from the school's official student newspaper. When their paper was banned they published off campus with the help of the director of the Comal Recreation Center and continued distributing it at a store close to the high school. During his teen years, he spent time at the Pan American recreation center. There he learned from, Roy \\"Mr G\\" Guerrero, a 34-year employee of the Austin Parks and Recreation Department. Moya considered Guerrero to be his mentor. Here he developed strong leadership skills and found the value of helping others to realize their goals. With limited college opportunities after graduating from Austin High, Moya became a delivery boy for a print shop. The shop's pressmen pooled their money to pay Moya to clean the presses for them. Eventually, he learned the printing trade and became a union pressman. He had a lengthy career as a professional printer before entering politics.  Early public service  Moya served as National President of the Junior LULAC. Later he was a founding member of the Mexican American Democrats of Texas. He was also a member of the State Tejano Democrats. He served briefly as a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army and was stationed in Korea after hostilities had ceased. He attained the rank of Sergeant 1st Class and in 1955 was honorably discharged.  Travis County Legal Aid Society  In the mid-‚Äô60s, the Travis County Legal Aid Society sought to hire a chief investigator. Knowing Moya had connections in the community, Justice of the Peace Jerry Dellana encouraged him to apply for the non-lawyer chief investigator position. His community contacts and his Spanish speaking ability gave him the edge over several veteran law enforcement applicants. As chief investigator he became familiar with the courthouse and its staff.  Travis County Commissioner  Moya became the first Hispanic Travis County commissioner when he was elected in 1970. At the time no Hispanic had ever been elected to local public office. He credited his election victory to the support of the striking workers of the Economy Furniture Company, where 252 Hispanic workers had walked off their jobs in November 1968. The workers helped with his campaign and used the $21 a week they got on the picket line to help cover $1,200 for Moya's radio ads. He repaid the workers with one of his first acts as commissioner, securing a resolution designating the date of a labor rally as ‚ÄúCesar Chavez Day.‚Äù This paved the way for labor organizer Cesar Chavez to speak at the strike rally at the Texas Capitol on November 29, 1970. Following his election, Gus Garcia was elected to the Austin school board, Gonzalo Barrientos was elected to the Texas Legislature and John Trevi√±o to the Austin City Council. Moya was the only minority on the Commissioners Court, \\"an outsider in another world,\\" observed colleague Gonzalo Barrientos Jr. \\"He went from outsider to the driving force that ushered Travis County government into the modern era.\\" He targeted one local issue after another, always with a common focus on human dignity. He helped centralize county hiring by playing a pivotal role in establishing the county's first office of Human Resources. This promoted diversity in county hiring, since before 1970 the county employed very few minorities. ‚ÄúThey just didn‚Äôt hire them,‚Äù Moya said. ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt have a personnel office. Everybody did their own hiring. I wanted to change that.‚Äù Virgil Lim√≥n, a retiree of the county's district clerk's office, said ‚ÄúHe also opened the doors for minorities to get hired in all parts of the county.‚Äù He helped establish a rural transportation program called CARTS, and he supported the development of a program that became known as StarFlight which provided emergency services. He pushed for a child abuse unit in the district attorney's office and greatly improved the county's mental health services. He was a catalyst for cultural change in Travis County government. Although he served on a commissioners court of strong personalities such as Mike Renfro, Jimmy Snell, Bob Honts and Ann Richards, he was the driving force, because \\"he had the ability to persuade others to follow his lead\\", Barrientos remembered. Hank Davis Gonzalez, a retired Austin Police detective, took on the legendary \\"Moya Machine\\" and ousted 16-year veteran Moya from the Pct. 4 Commissioners seat in 1986. In 1998 Moya ran again for the Pct. 4 position, in a failed attempt to oust Margaret G√≥mez, his former employee.  Texas State Government service  After leaving the commissioners court Moya worked for Jim Hightower at the Texas Department of Agriculture as the Director of Field Operations. His focus was on handling personnel issues and working with field offices. After Ann Richards was elected Governor, she hired Moya as a Deputy Chief of Staff. He was a trouble shooter for problem agencies and he used his experience to help Richards bring diversity to state boards and commissions. Throughout, he continued his push for better government, just as he had done as a county commissioner.  Personal life  In 1953 Moya married Gertrude ‚ÄúGertie‚Äù Garza. Together they had a son who died at age 19 and a daughter, Lori Moya, who followed her father into politics, serving on the Austin school board from 2006 to 2014. Known as a family man, he always made time for them. A Texas Longhorn fan, he followed their football, basketball, and baseball teams.  Legacy  Moya's most visible legacy is Richard Moya Park, 100 acres of woodlands and ball fields along Onion Creek, close to the Austin airport. His political legacy lives on in the changes he brought to Travis County government, having opened the door for the hiring and election of minorities. Death Moya died after a battle with prostate cancer at age 84 in 2017.

Beattie House is the last remaining building associated with Cotner College and the original settlement of Bethany Heights. Cotner College, originally called Nebraska Christian University, was founded in 1889 by the Nebraska Christian Missionary Alliance on 300 acres of donated land. James A. Beattie, president of the Nebraska Christian Education Board, purchased three lots across the street from the college in 1889. However, Beattie did not build his house--located on the center lot, directly across from the north entrance of the main building of Cotner College--until 1892 when he was named president of the college. In 1901, Beattie sold the home to Samuel A. Miles, a Nebraska pioneer. Samuel Miles' thirteen-year-old son, Clarence G. Miles, grew up in the home and later attended Cotner College. Clarence went on to study at Harvard Law School before being elected Mayor of Lincoln in 1947. Bethany voted to be annexed by the city of Lincoln in 1922, Cotner College closed its Bethany location in 1933, and the Miles family sold the Beattie House in 1945.

History Ajus and Jo√© established themselves in Hotel Algarve in Rua da Padaria (Bakery Street), in the lower district of Lisbon, in November 1911. There, they started seeing ophthalmic patients that they treated, by all accounts, \\"by extracting maggots, like the ones found inside fruits, from their eyes\\". The putative treatment the Chinese women offered consisted of, after applying a few drops of a certain liquid, massaging the patients' foreheads with \\"two little wooden sticks\\", after which they extracted \\"worms\\" from the patients' eyes (later on, it was verified following a microscopic examination, that these \\"worms\\" were housefly larvae ‚Äì that the civil government authorities claimed were put there by the Chinese women themselves, by sleight of hand). A cartoon depicting the Chinese women extracting creatures from Z√© Povinho's eyes (A Capital, 20 November 1911) Several people attested having regained their vision after being treated by the \\"miraculous Chinese women\\", and these testimonies drag crowds to the Chinese women, in hopes they would heal their eye afflictions. Meanwhile, the authorities intervened: the civil governor of Lisbon, Eus√©bio Le√£o (himself a physician by training), forbids the healers from seeing patients, alleging unauthorized practice of medicine. When confronted with favourable patients' testimony he says, in an interview to the newspaper A Capital, that it is all a matter of gullibility and the power of suggestion, and alerts to the unsanitary nature of the healers' procedures: \\"I feel a great commiseration for all those unfortunate people who, in their eagerness for a cure or even any degree of recovery, risk everything, make the greatest sacrifices, and believe in the miracles with which creatures of no scruples try to take advantage of them; but the duty of all of us, who are aware of the ignoble exploitation, is to defend them even against themselves, avoiding not only said exploitation but the dangers it entails.\\" Mandarin Eu- S√©-bio Li-√Éo\\" (A Capital, 25 November 1911) This generated a great protest movement, with several people petitioning the President, Parliament, the Ministry of the Interior and the civil government to uphold the rights of the Chinese women. As all this was to no avail, and the healers were still forbidden to see patients, popular discontent grew and, in the morning hours of 25 November, the police stormed Hotel Algarve to escort the Chinese women out of the country: they were taken to Vila Franca de Xira, where they were put in a 2nd class carriage of the train to Badajoz, Spain, under escort by four guards. Following this move, the popular protests become more violent and take up the streets. On 26 November, a commission composed of Ant√≥nio Bell√°, Constantino Mendes, Gaspar da Silva, Manuel Augusto Ferreira, J√∫lio Cruz, Jos√© da Veiga, Armando Almeida, and Jos√© Candeias, organises a public rally against the deportation of the Chinesas dos Bichos, by the Anjos Church. Impassioned speeches were made: about it being a \\"protest against all those who just want to make money, no matter the results\\", crying for \\"justice to be made, and respect for the foreigners\\", that \\"the Constitution was flouted when the police entered the home of respected citizens\\", that ophthalmologists had colluded to get rid of the Chinese women, and attacking Eus√©bio Le√£o \\"as a physician, as civil governor, and chiefly as a Republican\\". The crowd then gathered at the Rotunda, where further speeches were made; from there, they marched down Avenida da Liberdade towards the seat of the Civil Government, in the Chiado neighbourhood. As Eus√©bio Le√£o was not there, the crowd split: one part went to the main offices of the newspaper A Lucta where they demonstrated against Brito Camacho, a member of Parliament who had dismissed the case as \\"a simple matter for the police\\"ComunicAR ‚Äì Boletim da Assembleia da Rep√∫blica (Outubro de 2017) (due to the proximity of the residence of President Arriaga ‚Äì at the time, Horta Seca Palace ‚Äì infantry and cavalry units of the National Republican Guard had to secure the building), the others filled Rossio Square, where \\"improvised speakers inflamed passersby, going from the Chinese women to current politics, and were met with applause and hurrays\\". Ant√≥nio Machado Santos, the hero of the Republican Revolution just one year prior, tried to calm down the crowd, but was forced to take refuge in a shop, under gun fire, and only managed to leave in an automobile after the National Republican Guard arrived. Crowd in front of the Anjos Church, on 26 November 1911 The exchange of fire between the Guard and the crowd produced 46 injured, 1 casualty (milliner Jos√© da Costa, aged 20, who died on the morning of 27 November in S√£o Jos√© Hospital after being shot twice on the chest), and several arrests. The following day, 27 November 1911, the incidents were discussed at length in Parliament: Machado Santos, who had been one of those assaulted, attributed the disturbances of the public order to \\"troublemakers and professional hecklers\\", as did Ant√≥nio Granjo. Others saw in the events a symptom of the people's disenchantment with the new Republican regime, as belief and support of quackery was very much at odds with the positivist and secularist values that it espoused.

Data collection during this time was not consistent or broadly recorded and there have been efforts to reconstruct plausible statistics. Mortality rates vary on geographic location, social environment, and cultural values. There were also gender differences in the mortality rates, leading to an excess mortality rate in urban areas and in the female population. A main cause of death was stillbirth, which could be attributed to, but not limited to, maternal infections, birth complications, and congenital anomalies. Another contributing factor to the mortality rate was food insecurity and shortages as well as unemployment, both of which varied per region. A final factor was violence, which occurred mainly due to structural or systemic violence; however, violence since the 12th century has been steadily falling.  Data collection  Data from the early modern age was not accurately or consistently collected. However, there have been a number of studies and reconstructed statistics from this era, particularly on children and women. There has not been any empirical research published and the only information has been theoretical as there has been insufficient data and sources. It was also common for many statistics to go unreported; this is especially true regarding unmarried women. Models and theoretic equations need to take into account \\"social, economic, cultural, geographical, and even climatological variables\\" in order to accurately reflect the statistics of the time.  Gender differences  One study, the Eurasia Project, has shown that boys, especially those under one year, had a higher mortality rate during childhood than girls, but the mortality rate for men and women were about equal. It has also been shown that there is a higher male mortality than female mortality rate during the time of famine. Male mortality has also been linked to \\"economic modernization and urbanization ... especially for cardiovascular disease\\". Women faced increased mortality during childbirth as pregnancy and childbirth compromised the mother's immune system, with the most common causes of death being puerperal fever, toxemia, and hemorrhage. These dangers suggest an association to the excess female mortality, especially considering that women had to compete more for resources as they had no property rights and had a lower ranking in the household hierarchy. The average age of childbearing differed between Asia and Europe with an average difference of five years, which would affect cross-cultural data collection. Children born to mothers 35 years or older had a higher risk of mortality than children born to younger mothers. linking a mother's health and a child's survival. Female infants and children often had a higher mortality rate, especially in times of food insecurity, compared to male infants and children. However, a maternal presence worked as a protective factor for children. regardless of age or gender.  Economics  Food insecurity and shortages were common throughout this time period and were matched with the high food prices and high unemployment rate. This is shown through the differences in mortality rates between the lower and upper class, with poor infants being up to two times more likely to die than their wealthier counterparts. In 17th century Europe, it was common that at least one in five children from the same family would die before the age of one. Because of this high rate, it was common for there to be a large amount of children in one family so that there would be a higher rate of survival. Especially among poorer families, having multiple children was common in order to ensure there would be children to contribute to the family later on. During the early modern era, house calls were common. If the patient was female, the doctor, commonly an upper class male, would typically be summoned by a male family member who wound remain throughout the examination. The physician and male family member would then discuss the diagnosis and treatment plan without the female's input. This practice reinforced and perpetuated social hierarchies and patriarchal values.  Death and diseases  Food shortages and insecurity were leading concerns in the 18th century, especially in Europe, and these were exacerbated by reduced harvests yields. Disease was another leading cause of death, with rats and fleas being the common carriers of disease, specifically plagues, during this era. The Black Death was a plague that affected much of the world, originating in Asia and spreading to Europe through diseased fleas and rats. This epidemic has been reported to have been the cause of death for approximately \\"60% of the European population\\". During the end of the 19th century, there was a plague, known as the Modern Plague, that started in China and spread to different cities through ports, reportedly causing roughly ten million deaths. This plague affected Asia, the Americas, and Africa and lasted into the 20th century. There were also epidemics that occurred locally and did not spread to national levels, notably in 18th century England. These local epidemics included fevers, dysentery, smallpox, starvation, typhoid fever, under- nutrition, cholera, malaria. By the end of the era, disease and malnutrition were no longer the main leading causes of death.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades. It's situated north of the North Cascades Highway on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Majestic Mountain, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the ridge drains into Ross Lake via tributaries of the Skagit River. Climate McKay Ridge is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. McKay Ridge (left) and Azurite Peak seen from North Cascades Highway During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The Quack Doctor is a panel painting by the Dutch artist Gerrit Dou from 1652. It depicts a crowd gathered around a quack doctor as he promotes his wares. Dou also paints himself leaning out the window with a palette in hand. By including himself in the composition, he contrasts the deceptions involved in painting with those of quack medicine. For Dou, the composition was a departure; he was known for niche pieces, which depict an interior framed by a window. The painting has been written about quite extensively and is among the best-known treatments of its subject. Scenes of quack doctors (kwakzolvers) represented folly and were a common topic in Dutch genre painting, by artists such as Jan Steen, Jan Victors, and Jan Miense Molenaer. Genre scenes of kwaksolvers might depict them performing surgery to the legs, feet, or head (removing the \\"stone of folly\\"), extracting teeth, and offering patent medicines. The painting's symbolism confirms the futility of the quack's offerings. The people are portrayed as gullible, except for those who mirror the quack's deceit: the boy at far right picks the pocket of a woman, and another boy lures a bird. The painting's details would be familiar to its audience from emblem books or proverbs. A woman wiping her child's bottom alludes to the nature of the quack's offerings. She is a seller of pancakes, which sound when cooking like the chatter of the mountebank. His oversized diploma would be seen as fake. The scene takes place during a fair, when laws and guild regulations were loosened, and outside merchants had the freedom to sell their wares. The fair is announced by the poster at right, and the man carrying a dead hare shows the loosening of hunting laws. Dou's picture is a large work for him, perhaps indicating its importance to the artist. The location can be determined by the town gate, windmill, and bridge in the background: this is Dou's studio in Galgewater, Leiden. The setting highlights Dou's intent to compare the deceptions of the painter, imitator of reality, with those of the quack. Dou may be comforting his higher-class audience by suggesting that they are above the pictured fray, or he may be expressing reservations about his own occupation's use of deception. Dou was an excellent trompe-l'≈ìil painter. The composition includes a living tree and a dead tree‚Äîa familiar motif of choice‚Äîperhaps implying that only the artistic use of deceit is morally permissible.

Faisal Hussain killed two people and wounded thirteen using a Smith & Wesson M&P; .40-calibre. He committed suicide after a shootout with Toronto Police Service (TPS) officers. Incident Around 10:00 p.m. EDT on July 22, 2018, Faisal Hussain walked along Toronto's busy Danforth Avenue in the Greektown area of the city, randomly shooting pedestrians before opening fire on crowded restaurants. The incident began around Danforth and Logan avenues near the restaurant named Christina's. Witnesses described 10 to 15 blasts similar to firecrackers, while others reported hearing gunshots and seeing a man holding a gun. Further along the Danforth at Chester Avenue, witnesses said they saw a man shooting from a sidewalk into another restaurant named Demetre's. The shooter continued to walk westbound on Danforth Avenue towards Hampton Avenue, where witnesses said the shooter crossed the street from the north side to the south side and fired into the 7Numbers restaurant near Bowden Street where one victim was shot. The shooter chose not to shoot certain people he encountered, telling one man, \\"Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you.\\" TPS officers responded to calls from witnesses and located the gunman on Bowden Street and initiated a shootout with the suspect. The gunman ran back to Danforth Avenue where he was found dead. At the corner of Danforth and Logan avenues, police cordoned off an area from bystanders and detonated an unidentified package for undisclosed reasons. Victims right 18-year-old Reese Fallon and 10-year-old Julianna Kozis were killed in the attack. Thirteen others suffered gunshot wounds, ranging in age from 17 to 59. Toronto Paramedic Services transported eight victims to trauma centres ‚Äì including four people to St. Michael's Hospital, three to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and one to The Hospital for Sick Children. St. Michael's reported it was treating five patients. Three of them underwent immediate lifesaving surgery after the shooting and the others were in serious but stable condition. Two gunshot victims were treated at the nearby Michael Garron Hospital and were in stable condition. Five other patients were treated for issues \\"in relation to the shooting\\", but were not shot. Perpetrator The Special Investigations Unit (SIU) identified the perpetrator as 29-year-old Faisal Hussain. Hussain was born to Canadian parents of Pakistani origin according to people who knew the family. In a public statement, Hussain's parents said that he was psychotic and depressed throughout his life. In 2010, Hussain told a friend that he was seeing a psychiatrist about these problems. A former teacher described him as \\"very disturbed\\" and recounted having to take him to a psychiatric facility after he started carving into his face with the blade of a pencil sharpener. Another former teacher called the police after Hussain allegedly said, without prompting, that \\"it would be really cool to kill someone.\\" His family had been struggling through the death of his sister in a car accident and his brother's ongoing coma after an overdose or a stroke. According to a neighbour, Hussain was not religious and declined to participate in Friday prayers. According to his brother, Hussain had \\"started attending a mosque with his father, but did not seem that interested in religion.\\" In 2010, Hussain was investigated by TPS under the provincial Mental Health Act. On July 24, 2018, the Ministry of Public Safety said there is currently no connection between him and national security. He was not on any federal watchlists. Some news reports suggested Hussain was inspired by Elliot Rodger and the incel ideology.https://nationalpost.com/news/toronto/toronto-danforth-mass-shooters- long-dark-obsession-with-death-violence-and-incel-ideology Investigation In the immediate aftermath of the shooting, police did not identify a motive, saying that they were investigating \\"every possible motive, including terrorism.\\" On July 23, police executed a search warrant at Hussain's residence in the Thorncliffe Park neighbourhood of the city. A day later, CBS News published that, according to a law enforcement source, Hussain visited ISIL websites which may have expressed his support for the Islamic militant group; he was also speculated to have previously lived in Afghanistan and Pakistan, but the investigation has revealed that his actions did not appear to be directed by ISIL. On July 25, Amaq News Agency, citing a \\"security source\\", stated that he was \\"from the soldiers of Islamic State\\",\\"ISIL claims responsibility for Toronto Danforth shooting, but police say there's 'no evidence' at this stage\\", Adrian Humphreys, The National Post yet Toronto Police said there was no evidence of an ISIL connection. Amarnath Amarasingam of the London-based Institute for Strategic Dialogue doubted Amaq's claim and said it may have been prompted by the CBS News article. People of Toronto left floral tributes for 10-year-old Julianna Kozis Since Hussain was found dead after a shootout, the SIU looked into whether he was shot by police or shot himself.

Spencer served as an advocate for survivors of child sexual abuse, introducing and gaining passage in 2015 of a landmark civil statute of limitations (SOL) reform legislation, known as the Georgia Hidden Predator Act (HB 17, 2015). This legislation removed or extended the civil SOL so survivors can gain justice and expose the identities of hidden pedophiles in the state of Georgia. The Hidden Predator Act was instrumental in leading to the unraveling of one of the largest sex scandals in U.S. sports history: the exposure of Dr. Larry Nassar, who was later convicted of serial child molestation committed while serving the USA Gymnastics organization. Rep. Spencer received Voice Today's \\"Voice of Gratitude Award\\" for his efforts authoring the legislation. In 2018, Spencer attempted to amend this 2015 law to strengthen it and provide more time for survivors to file cases, but the bill was weakened by lobbying efforts from the Atlanta Archdiocese of the Catholic Church, the Boy Scouts of America, and other powerful interest groups. It narrowly failed to pass on the last day of the 2018 legislative session. In 2017, Spencer introduced and passed legislation, known as the Georgia Space Flight Act (House Bill 1, 2017), to attract the commercial space industry to Georgia as part of an ongoing effort to establish the state's first commercial spaceport. =Issues during tenure= Spencer was one of the strongest opponents in the Georgia House to President Barack Obama's administration's Affordable Care Act (ACA).Greg Bluestein, My AJC: \\"State lawmaker picks a fight over Medicaid 'experiment' \\", Atlanta Journal-Constitution (May 28, 2015). He authored legislation that effectively blocked Medicaid expansion in Georgia, although the federal government would have covered most of the costs of extending health care to needy constituents. Spencer also blocked the establishment of the state's insurance marketplace, and forced the University of Georgia to terminate its \\"Obamacare\\" Navigator program under the Act.Andy Miller, \\"Legislator: Waiver plan still requires legislative OK\\", Georgia Health News (May 27, 2015). In 2014, Spencer introduced legislation to block the state from \\"using of its resources to implement any portions of the health care law.\\"Misty Williams, Medicaid expansion: House panel votes to shift power to Legislature, Atlanta Journal-Constitution (February 19, 2014). When this legislation was tabled by Senate Majority Whip Cecil Station (R-Macon) and other opponents in committee, Spencer issued a press release blaming fellow Republicans for an \\"eleventh hour betrayal\\" and likening them to \\"Benedict Arnolds, the King George the Third and his myrmidons.\\"On the Record, Atlanta Journal Constitution (March 22, 2014). In 2016, after facing bipartisan opposition, Spencer withdrew a bill that was perceived to have banned Muslim women from wearing religious garments such as burqas or niqƒÅbs in driver's license photographs or while driving cars. The legislation aimed to amend an existing 1951 Georgia law intended to prohibit members of the Ku Klux Klan from wearing masks and hoods; it had been constitutionally upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court in State v Miller, 1990] to unmask members of the group. Many, including the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations (CAIR) and American Civil Liberties Union, accused Spencer of Islamophobia. Spencer accused a constituent of treason and supporting terrorism for donating $10 to CAIR Georgia in response to his bill. Spencer supported his charge of potential treason in a letter written to his constituent stating that the Council on American‚ÄìIslamic Relations (CAIR) was designated as a terrorist organization by the United Arab Emirates due to the organization's alleged ties to Hamas, an organization which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S. Department of State. In addition, Spencer stated that CAIR was named by the U.S. Justice Department as an unindicted co-conspirator in the largest terrorism funding trials in U.S. history, known as United States v Holy Land Foundation, et. al., claims which CAIR has rejected. As a result of the backlash of submitting this legislation, Spencer said he had received death threats. In 2017, Spencer attracted controversy in the debate over the removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. In a Facebook post, he issued a warning to LaDawn Jones, an African American attorney, former Georgia House colleague and current State Director for Bernie Sanders' Presidential Campaign, that she might \\"go missing in the Okefenokee,\\" a swamp in southern Georgia (and partly in Spencer's district), if she followed through on her intentions to bring advocates to southern Georgia to remove Confederate monuments. =Primary defeat= In May 2018, Spencer was defeated in the Republican primary by a primary challenger, 24-year-old political newcomer Steven Sainz. A local party leader attributed Spencer's loss in part to his \\"antics\\" in office. Spencer said \\"if he rubbed anyone the wrong way,\\" he was doing so by standing up to powerful special interest representing the plight of \\"little guy.\\" ‚ÄúMy tactics won against them and that is one of the reasons why I stayed in office for eight years, because I effectively beat them at their own game,‚Äù said Spencer to the Brunswick News. In a radio interview with WGIG 1440 AM, Rep. Jason Spencer said that he had often been a target of individuals on the ideological left and establishment politicians for introducing legislation that challenged powerful special interests. He believed such opponents blocked a bill in 2018 to strengthen a law extending civil justice to survivors of child sexual abuse. =TV appearance= Spencer was featured on the July 22, 2018, episode of Sacha Baron Cohen's show Who Is America?. At the urging of Baron Cohen, who posed as an Israeli counter-terrorism expert, Spencer exposed his bare buttocks, imitated a Chinese tourist using racial stereotypes, used a selfie stick to take an upskirt picture under a woman's burqa, and repeatedly yelled \\"nigger.\\" Georgia House Speaker David Ralston urged Spencer to resign, saying that he had \\"disgraced himself.\\" Governor Nathan Deal tweeted that Spencer's actions were \\"appalling and offensive.\\" Spencer apologized for what he described as \\"this ridiculously ugly episode\\" but initially refused to step down, saying that the show's producers had exploited him \\"for profit and notoriety.\\" He said that Baron Cohen and his crew had falsely promised that Spencer would be able to review and have final approval over any footage used. Spencer later announced his resignation on July 24, effective as of July 31. =Election results= Personal life Spencer lives with his wife and their two daughters in Woodbine. They are members of the Harbor Worship Center, a Christian church in Kingsland, Georgia.

She joined the fledgling Long Beach police force in January 1908, making her one of the country's earliest policewomen. Family and education She was born Fanny Weston Bixby in Los Angeles, California, the youngest of nine surviving children of Jotham Bixby and Margaret Hathaway Bixby. Jotham had arrived in California in 1852 from Maine, where he and several cousins had formed Flint, Bixby & Company, which acquired major landholdings, including the 27,000-acre Rancho Los Cerritos in what is now Long Beach. Fanny grew up wealthy, and although she was an active philanthropist, when she died in 1930 her $2.5 million estate was the largest ever probated in Orange County up to that point. Fanny grew up on Rancho Los Cerritos, of which Jotham was the manager. Later, Fanny's grandfather, the prominent abolitionist and Unitarian minister George Whitefield Hathaway, came to live with the family. Fanny Bixby wrote about his abolitionist activities, including turning his house into a station on the Underground Railroad, in her pamphlet entitled How I Became a Socialist. Fanny Bixby was educated at the Marlborough School in Los Angeles and the Pomona Preparatory School. She attended Wellesley College for three years but left without a degree. At Wellesley, she studied sociology with Emily Greene Balch, who would go on to win the 1946 Nobel Peace Prize. Philanthropy and police work While still at Wellesley College, she worked for a time at the Denison Settlement House in Boston (founded by Balch) and the Nurse's Settlement House in San Francisco. On leaving college, she moved back to Long Beach, where she founded the Newsboy Club in the basement of a building her father owned so that the paper delivery boys would have somewhere to go that was off the streets. She also taught some of the newsboys to read. She donated money to various civic causes, including Long Beach's first hospital (Seaside Hospital), and the Walt Whitman School (private) and her settlement house, both in the Boyle Heights district on the east-side of Los Angeles. She and her husband often invited ghetto youth of working mothers to stay on their farm in Orange County to divert them from gangs and delinquency. In 1907 she founded what is now Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. She also help found the town of Costa Mesa, California. When Long Beach formed its police force in 1908, Captain Tom Williams brought Fanny Bixby onto the force because of her extensive philanthropic work in the city. She was sworn in as a special police matron on January 1, 1908, making her one of the first women police officers in the country. The Los Angeles Herald reported of her appointment that California was \\"now demonstrating that when necessary a woman can become a policeman, or should we say policewoman?\\" Fanny Bixby had charge of all cases involving women and children and was authorized to make arrests. She refused any pay, and thus did not become the country's first paid policewoman ‚Äî that honor would go to Alice Stebbins Wells two years later. Fanny Bixby worked with the Long Beach police force for four years. Antiwar activities An admirer of Leo Tolstoy, Fanny Bixby was a socialist and a pacifist. She published some poetry in the California Socialist Party's newspaper, the Oakland World, and she attended at least one antiwar meeting in Pasadena before the Espionage Act of 1917 made it risky to speak out against the government. After the war, she published her views in a number of antiwar pamphlets. She was strongly against militaristic symbolism, such as standing for the Pledge of Allegiance, forcing children to sing the national anthem in schools, and saluting the flag. Her 1920 play The Jazz of Patriotism was about a woman who is ostracized for refusing to salute the flag. It premiered at the Egan Theater (later the Musart Theater) in downtown Los Angeles.

Personal life Fanny Bixby met her future husband, W. Carl Spencer, at a Socialist Party meeting in 1917. They moved to Costa Mesa (then named Harper) in 1919, where they raised five adopted children and supported many others. Formerly a dockworker, Carl became a developer, and Fanny continued her philanthropy to such effect that in the decade they lived there, the town grew from 250 to 3,000 residents. The couple donated land to the city for a park and a library. Fanny Bixby Spencer died of cancer at the age of 51. A couple of years before she died, she wrote to her cousin Sarah Bixby Smith: \\"I have three lines of work, bringing up my foster children, helping my neighbors (mostly Japanese farmers) and banging my head against the stone wall of militarism and conservatism that hems me in.\\" Her papers are housed at the Rancho Los Cerritos Museum.

It originated, in 1918/1919, from a private collection of 100 braille volumes collected by Miss Comber, a British nurse. On her recall to England in 1919, Miss Comber requested that Josie Wood make accessible these materials. Josie Wood accepted the offer and housed the materials in a room in her house in Grahamstown.

Archaeological excavations revealed that the 4th-century church building was originally the baptistery of a cathedral, which no longer exists. History The Syriac Orthodox church is located in Nusaybin il√ße (district), formerly Nisibis, of Mardin Province in southeastern Tƒ±rkey. It is situated around east of the Zeynel Abidin Mosque Complex. The church is dedicated to Syriac Jacob of Nisibis, who became bishop of Nisibis by appointment of Episcopal congress, convened in Virgin Mary Church of Diyarbakƒ±r in 309, and was later venerated saint (). The church was built by Jacob of Nisibis between 313‚Äì320. It is considered as one of the oldest churches in Upper Mesopotamia. According to some inscriptions and texts, the church was built as the baptistery of a cathedral at that place. However, it was converted to a church after the cathedral and some other buildings were ruined. Architecture A view from the interior of the Church of Saint Jacob Saint Jacob of Nisibis The church building features the characteristics of the Late Roman and Early Byzantium architecture. It consists of two sections. In the southern building, there are two separate parts with two opposed buttresses. A square place of with two doorways in the northern and southern walls is situated in the eastern part. Its eastern wall has an apse. On the west side, an arch opening leads to the western part of the southern section. The eastern part features wall decorations and friezes on the arches and apse's niche. Corinthian helmets decorate all the buttresses except those facing west. It is likely that the middle and western buttresses were added later. The western part of the building has arched doors decorated with fine ornaments in the northern and southern walls. Eight of the doors in the northern and southern walls have horseshoe-like arches. The arches and the pillars are decorated with ornaments. An inscription in Ancient Greek found on the middle frieze reads: \\"This baptistery was built with the contribution of priest Akepsyma in 571 (359/360), when Volagesus was metropolitan. Let them be remembered before God\\". A dome, dated back to 1872 according to an inscription of it, covers the eastern square room. A chamber was added on the western side the same year. Beneath the eastern square room's floor, there is crypt containing a sarcophagus, which is believed to belong to Mor Yakup. The northern section of the building was constructed by using the north wall of the southern section. The construction method of the buttresses in this section, which is also observed in many church buildings in Tur Abdin in the same region, indicates that this part was built in the 8th century. It has the dimensions . A third nave is situated on a mosaic-covered platform in front of the southern section. Excavation and restoration A project for the restoration of the church building started in 2000. It was carried out by √áEK√úL, the cultural heritage foundation, in collaboration with the Municipality of Nusaybin and the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Excavation works were carried out in the area between the church and the mosque as well as in the church yard. After removal of some -deep dirt, column pedestals were unearthed, placed on a ground of fine-cut limestone. A masonry well of depth still containing water has three different superimposed well tops, most likely due to the rising of the ground level with dirt during all the years before. In the eastern section of the northern yard, a stone-covered platform is situated reachable by three stairs. A sarcophagus with acroterion was discovered under the platform. The eastern yard is covered with trees. Graves spreading the entire area were found in the western yard after removal of nearly -thick dirt. The graves were dug in east-west direction, and were built in rubble masonry or spolia. The skeletons are found laying on the back, arms crossed on the chest and heads turned facing east. In particular children graves, items were found such as glass bracelets, necklaces made of various beads and trims. Graves with late period characteristics reveal the Christian burial customs of Assyrian people. Seven residences, which were illegally built in the area between the church and the mosque, were dispossessed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and demolished when it appeared in 2007 and 2008 that annex buildings of the church were reaching out towards the mosque. Foundation of the nonexistent Nisibis Cathedral, which was one of the biggest church buildings in the Middle East, and architectural structures of the Artuqids era (1101‚Äì1409) were unearthed. Excavations continued until 2014 in the area of . Thousands of ceramic, metal, glass and stone artifacts unearthed during the 15-year-long excavations were included into the findings of 2017, and were analyzed and registered by a group of archeologists, art historians and conservator- restorers of the Mardin Museum.

It comes from the word in French for \\"wake\\" and can best be described as how a fragrance diffuses around the wearer. Sillage or diffusion in fragrances can also be called the \\"projection\\" of a fragrance. Compounds such as Hedione (methyl dihydrojasmonate) can be used to enhance the diffusivity of a fragrance. Hedione is a synthetic relative of methyl jasmonate, a naturally occurring compound in floral scents such as jasmine, tuberose and magnolia. Methyl jasmonate is also found in many other plant parts and is considered to be a signalling molecule. It is considered one of the compounds responsible for the projection of the scent in living flowers and was first fully characterised between 1957 and 1962 in jasmine absolute (0.8%) by the fragrance chemist Edouard Demole who was working at Firmenich. The first commercially successful fragrance to utilise Hedione was Eau Sauvage by perfumer Edmond Roudnitska for Christian Dior , launched in 1966. The addition of Hedione to a classically hesperidic fragrance construction created a dewy lemony magnolia-jasmine dimension without being directly floral, and gave it a new type of projection and transparency not experienced before in this type of perfume. This is considered to be the beginning of a new trend in perfumery towards transparency and projection. Compounds such as damascones, Iso-E super (Tetramethyl acetyloctahydronaphthalenes), linalool and some of the synthetic musks such as cashmeran may also be added to fragrances to enhance their diffusion and sillage. A fragrance does not need to be a heavy one to have a large sillage; fragrances such as Giorgio Beverly Hills for women and Poison (Dior) are very good examples of this. Eau Sauvage and L'eau d'Issey (Jaques Cavallier for Issey Miyake) have a large sillage but may be considered much lighter examples of this. Sillage in a perfume could also be considered to be how a fragrance is perceived by others around the wearer and is enhanced by motion, ambient temperature as well as the inherent qualities of the skin. According to an article by Mookerjee, a fragrance is perceived by the diffusion of individual fragrance molecules. The rate of diffusion of these molecules in a fragrance, however, appears to be independent of their molecular weights, boiling points, odour thresholds and odour value. Once a fragrance is applied to the skin, the skin itself becomes a substrate to the scent. The inherent scent of the individual skin, moisturisation of the skin, the behaviour of the microbiome of the skin, and the temperature of the surface of the skin that the fragrance is applied to will affect the sillage or diffusion of a perfume applied to it.

A member of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington, she served as its vice-chairwoman from 2012 to 2015 and is, a board member for Our Revolution and the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center. She is also a co-founder of Indigenous Women Rise. During the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013, Parker successfully campaigned both for the reauthorization and for the inclusion of provisions which gave tribal courts jurisdiction over violent crimes against women and families involving non‚ÄìNative Americans on tribal lands. She also served in the 2016 Democratic National Convention as one of the platform committee members representing Bernie Sanders, where she \\"helped to ensure that Native policy initiatives were ultimately rolled into the party's larger platform.\\" Biography Deborah Parker is a member of the Tulalip Tribes of Washington and is of Tulalip, Lummi, Yaqui, and Apache descent; her native name, Tsi-Cy- Altsa, extends back multiple generations on her mother's side. Her grandfather, who was of Lummi heritage, was from Cowichan Bay; her grandmother was from the Snohomish River area. Born in 1970 as the daughter of a Tulalip father and Yaqui‚ÄìApache mother, she grew up on the reservation, where she became intimately familiar with many of the problems facing the Native American community that she later sought to address. In 1999, she graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Arts in American ethnic studies and sociology. Since graduating, Parker has been involved in numerous groups and organizations. Prior to working for the Tulalip Tribes, Parker served as the director of the residential healing school of the Tsleil-Waututh First Nation and participated in the Treaty Taskforce Office of the Lummi Nation, wherein she was mentored by indigenous leaders such as Billy Frank Jr., Joe DeLaCruz, Henry Cagey, and Jewell James. Later, she developed two programs for the Tulalip Tribes: Young Mothers, a culturally relevant initiative for teen mothers; and the Tribal Tobacco Program, which promoted responsible tobacco use among tribal members while acknowledging tobacco's sacred role among indigenous peoples in the United States. From 2005 to 2012, Parker served as the Legislative Policy Analyst in the Office of Governmental Affairs for the Tulalip Tribes; and, in March 2012, she began serving as vice- chairwoman of the Tulalip Tribes, becoming its only woman board member and its youngest member. After serving three terms as vice-chair, she decided to not seek re-election in 2015 to focus more on her family and activism. While serving the Tulalip Tribes, Parker continued to involve herself in improving education and political engagement among Native Americans in Washington. In January 2005, she was elected as the treasurer for Choice & Consequence, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes healthy practices among Washington youth. She later was promoted to its board of directors as the president. In 2006, she participated in the development of Native Vote Washington, a 501(c)(4) organization that sought to encourage greater political participation among Native Americans. In 2007, Parker starred as Aunt Fran in Shadow of the Salmon, a docudrama about the significance of salmon among the Northwest Native peoples that was nominated for multiple awards. Later, in September 2010, she was appointed by the University of Washington's Friends of the Educational Opportunity Program as a member of its board of trustees, where she served her full three-year term. In the same year as her 2013 efforts in support of passing the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, Parker joined Mother Nation, then called Native Women in Need, as an honorary board member after eight months of supporting the group. She was initially drawn to the organization because of the work it did and the dedication of its founder. From 2014 to 2017, Parker served as a trustee board member for the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of the American Indian. In October 2017, Parker was selected by Marysville School District to serve as its director of Equity, Diversity, and Indian Education and continues to do so Parker lives in Tulalip, Washington, where she is a mother to three children and two stepchildren and is married to documentary filmmaker Myron Dewey (who is of Paiute and Shoshone descent). she is a board member for Our Revolution and the National Indigenous Women's Resource Center; the senior strategist for Pipestem Law, a lawfirm specializing in representing Native American interests; and the volunteer policy analyst for Mother Nation, a nonprofit organization supporting Native American women. Activism Parker describes her activism and resilience to resist despite hardships as \\"warrior status\\". She has been the recipient of numerous awards relating to her activism and tribal outreach, including the Native Action Network's 2010 Enduring Spirit Award, the National Indian Education Association's 2011 Parent of the Year Award, the Daughters of the American Revolution's 2013 Community Service Award, Potlatch Fund's 2013 Pearl Capoeman-Baller Civic Participation Award, the Snohomish County Human Rights Commission's 2016 Human Rights Award, and KSER's 2017 Voice of the Community Award for Community Impact by an Individual. In September 2015, she was honored as the first of fifty in Indian Country Todays 50 Faces of Indian Country 2015. Parker was also the keynote speaker at the second annual Faith and Action Climate Team (FACT) Conference in October 2017. =2012‚Äì13 Violence Against Women Act reauthorization= On March 7, 2013, Barack Obama signed the reauthorization act with Deborah Parker (left, with hat) by his side. During the political battle leading up to the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), Parker was \\"vital\\" in the campaigning that pushed for reauthorization and her public testimony to Congress in particular was influential. While in Washington, D.C., for an April 2012 meeting with the Environmental Protection Agency, Parker visited the staff of Washington senator Patty Murray to discuss salmon and natural resource issues. During the visit, she learned about the efforts to pass the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2012 and the struggle that Murray's team were having with keeping support for a provision on tribal jurisdiction. According to the team, the reauthorization would likely fail, especially with the tribal provision, because the legislation \\"lacked a face.\\" After being asked whether she knew any stories that could help the effort, Parker asked to speak directly with Murray. Murray was on the Senate floor at the time; she agreed to leave immediately to meet privately with Parker. Parker and Murray met later that afternoon to discuss the reauthorization bill and the inclusion of new provisions to allow tribal courts to prosecute non‚ÄìNative Americans for crimes against women and families on tribal lands. Parker, committed to ensuring that the VAWA was reauthorized with tribal provisions, decided that \\"she had to set aside her fear and become 'the face' and the voice for the issue of Native women and rape.\\" This was not something she originally planned to do. The next day after the meeting, on April 25, she detailed in a press conference to Congress experiences both she and other women she knew had with violence and sexual abuse on reservations, describing herself as \\"a Native American statistic\\". It was the first time Parker had publicly talked about the experiences she had. The Senate passed the VAWA reauthorization the following day with the protections for Native Americans included, though Republicans in the House of Representatives initially sought to remove them. Parker began to aggressively lobby in favor of the reauthorization and sought to convince members of Congress to support both it and its tribal provisions, so much so that then-president Obama got to know her by her native name and her \\"toes bled\\" from all the walking. She attended national cable news programs and provided interviews to newspapers across the country in support of the legislation. While lobbying the opponents of the bill, Parker felt she was \\"up against some of the worst discrimination I've ever seen in my entire life\\" and that Native American women were treated \\"like we were subhuman\\". The House of Representatives began proposing weaker language to the Senate in an attempt at compromise on the provision; Murray, Parker, and the rest refused. Before long, the opposition to the reauthorization and its tribal provisions eroded in the House and strong bipartisan support emerged. By the time the final bill was signed into law in March 2013, it included the tribal law provisions that Parker promoted. Four months later, in July 2013, Parker was honored by the Obama White House as one of the Open Government and Civic Hacking Champions of Change \\"working to improve their communities through technology, innovation, and civic participation.\\" For Murray, the VAWA reauthorization \\"would have never happened if Parker had not gone public with her story on Capitol Hill\\" and she \\"made the absolute difference at the absolute critical time\\" by \\"making her personal story become the face of what this was about\\". Around the same time, playwright Mary Kathryn Nagle released Sliver of a Full Moon, a play about the events surrounding the VAWA reauthorization that tells the stories of five Native American women and two Native men. Among the five women is Deborah Parker, played by Jennifer Bobiwash. Later, in October 2015, the tribal provisions were officially implemented for all tribes after a \\"very successful\\" pilot program involving the Tulalip, Pascua Yaqui, and Umatilla tribes. A year afterward, in October 2016, Parker was featured in the second campaign advertisement of Patty Murray's re-election in the 2016 United States Senate election in Washington. In the video, Parker briefly recounted her experiences with sexual assault and her work with Murray to help pass the VAWA reauthorization. =2016 US presidential election= During the 2016 Democratic National Convention, Parker served as one of the platform committee members representing Bernie Sanders after having been an early and vocal supporter of his 2016 presidential campaign. She was initially hesitant to do so, but accepted then‚ÄìDemocratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz's offer to join the platform committee, seeing it as an opportunity to advance the causes she supported, particularly \\"Native American sovereignty, climate justice, to increase [...] protections for women, [and] income inequality\\"; and to honor' Sanders and 'represent his vision' on the committee.\\" As a platform committee member, Parker \\"helped to ensure that Native policy initiatives were ultimately rolled into the party's larger platform.\\" She also authored one of the twelve \\"priority amendments\\" to the Democratic platform that the Sanders campaign supported, which sought to introduce language that explicitly promoted using global warming as a \\"test\\" for whether any policy or decision should be supported within relevant federal agencies. In June 2016, on the first day of the platform drafting hearing in St. Louis, Parker proposed a substitution amendment that replaced and strengthened the language in the section on honoring tribal nations. Elijah Cummings, the chairman presiding over the hearing, allotted Parker additional time and gave her the floor. While reading the amendment text, she was overwhelmed by the moment and began to cry. After some silence, James Zogby continued where Parker left off until she regained her composure and resumed. Barbara Lee noted afterward that in all her decades of attending Democratic National Conventions, she did not recall \\"any provision or plank in our platform that acknowledges the first people of the United States\\". Cornel West likewise commented that Parker's \\"very existence [...] on this committee is historically unprecedented\\". After further commendations from other committee members, and Cummings' recognition of Parker's \\"passion\\", the proposal was passed unanimously to a standing ovation. Specifically, the amendment text committed the Democratic Party to \\"uphold, honor, and strengthen to the highest extent possible the United States' fundamental trust and responsibility, grounded in the Constitution and treaties, to American Indian and Alaska Native tribes\\" because \\"throughout our history we have failed to live up to that trust\\". It also committed the party to restoring tribal lands to indigenous tribes; increasing funding and support for tribal communities, particularly in infrastructure, education, and health care; eliminating school and sports mascots that are derogatory, stereotyping, or racist toward Native Americans; and improving both tribal jurisdiction and indigenous voting rights. Lastly, the amendment endorsed \\"environmental justice in Indian Country\\" and acknowledged \\"the past injustices and the misguided, harmful federal and state policies and actions based on outdated and discredited values and beliefs that resulted in the destruction of the Indian nations' economies, social, and religious systems, the taking of their lands, and the creation of intergenerational trauma that exists to this day.\\" The amendment text was fully retained in the July 1 draft version and further expanded to strengthen language for Native Hawaiians by the time the official platform was released on July 21. Shortly after Our Revolution formed in August 2016, Parker joined it as a member of its board of directors. =Protests= Throughout the years, Parker has opposed and protested multiple pipeline projects out of concern for their environmental impact and effects on tribal lands. In September 2016, Parker and other Tulalip tribal members joined Standing Rock in protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. A month later, on November 15, 2016, Parker joined Eryn Wise, LaDonna Brave Bull Allard, and Judith LeBlanc for the protests' \\"National Day of Action\\", during which the four staged a sit-in at the Army Corps of Engineers headquarters and led a crowd of approximately 1,000 protestors around Washington, D.C. Parker joined other indigenous leaders and groups in January 2017 for the 2017 Women's March and marched in the Women's March on Washington. During the protest, a new group was formed called Indigenous Women Rise, of which she became a co- founder. A year later, in January 2018, she participated in the 2018 Women's March in Seattle, where she recounted the previous year's events. In an April 2018 article, Parker criticized Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and advocated for opposition to the Trans Mountain Pipeline in solidarity with First Nations peoples. Our Revolution released a statement doing likewise on the same day. Views During a 2016 interview, Parker described a national restriction on gun possession for those previously charged with domestic violence as a \\"necessity\\" for protecting women. She also censured Donald Trump's usage of \\"Pocahontas\\" as a nickname for Elizabeth Warren (who claims Cherokee and Delaware heritage), which she described as \\"very insulting\\"; and Trump's past treatment of tribal nations and their sovereignty more generally. Parker is critical of the US government's current and historic treatment of indigenous populations, comparing Native American reservations to \\"concentration camps\\". Regarding the traditional knowledge of indigenous peoples, especially traditional ecological knowledge and traditional medicine, Parker supports rules and guidelines which preserve indigenous ways of life and respect the privacy of certain traditions and practices. She also emphasizes the importance of viewing indigenous knowledge from an indigenous perspective, which may differ from \\"the Western-science approach\\" to these issues.

He was a talented amateur artist who produced still lifes, landscapes and portraits, most of which have not survived. He is mainly remembered as the patriarch of an artistic dynasty and as the father of the distinguished sculptor, Jawad Saleem. Life and career Mohammed Hajji Selim was born into a well-to-do family in Baghdad in 1883. His parents were both originally from Mosul in Northern Iraq. Like many of his contemporaries, Selim was educated at the Military Academy in Istanbul where drawing and painting were a standard part of the curriculum.Tejel, J., Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges, World Scientific, 2012, p. 476 This exposure to Western art techniques, encouraged Selim to take up painting as an amateur artist. Selim was part of a group of Iraqis which included; Salim Mohammed Saleh Zaki (1888-1974), Asim Hafidh (1886- ?) and Abdul Qadir Al Rassam (1882-1952) (who may have been Selim's relative), became the first group of modern Iraqi artists to take up easel painting and generally work in the European style.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq: The ancient sites and Iraqi Kurdistan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30 This group became known as the Ottomon artists and was largely responsible for stimulating an interest in Western art amongst the Iraqi population, which in turn, inspired the next generation of Iraqi artists.Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p.199 During the Ottoman reign, Selim became an officer in the Ottoman Army and, in the first decade of the 20th-century, he was stationed at Ankara where his youngest children were born.Shabout, N.

He became the patriarch of an dynasty of highly talented artists; the father of contemporary artists - Rashid Salim (b. 1918); Suad Salim (b. 1918 Ankara), Jawad Saleem (b. 1920 Ankara), Nazar Selim (b. 1925 Ankara) Naziha Salim (b. 1927 Istanbul).Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Ministry of Culture, Iraq, Culture and Arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17‚Äì30 Revolution, Iraq, Ministry of Culture and Arts, 1978, p. 23 Of his children, Rashid became a painter and political cartoonist; Jawad became a painter and sculptor responsible for the monumental work known as the Nasb al-Hurriyah in Baghdad's Liberation Square; Suad became an artist and designer who designed the coat of arms for the Iraqi Republic, Nizarre was an artist and Naziha became a painter, art educator and author.Ministry of Culture, Iraq, Culture and Arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17‚Äì30 Revolution, Iraq, Ministry of Culture and Arts, 1978, p. 23; Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 47; Ministry of Culture, Iraq, Culture and Arts in Iraq: Celebrating the Tenth Anniversary of the July 17‚Äì30 Revolution, Iraq, Ministry of Culture and Arts, 1978, p. 23 Selim reportedly gave painting away after recognising the genius of his son, Jawad.Metcher-Atassi, S., \\"Munif's Interest in Modern Art, Friendship, Symbolic Exchange and the Art of the Book,\\" The MIT Electronic Journal of Middle Eastern Studies, Spring, 2007, pp 99-116 Work Still Life by Mohammed Hajji Selim, 1941 Selim painted in still life, portrait and landscape, but few of his paintings survived the ravages of revolution, war and looting that afflicted Iraq throughout the 20th-century.

It was built to facilitate the loading of boats and barges with whinstone excavated from the nearby Rashielee Quarries that was brought to the quay by a horse drawn wagonway. History =The Lands of Rashielee= In 1497 Rashielee, North Barr, Craigton and Barscube were obtained by charter from the Darnley's, Earls of Lennox by the Stewarts of Barscube. This family held the lands until around 1670 when most of the estate was sold by Thomas Stewart to a wealthy Glasgow merchant, Donald Mac Gilchrist, who built the old North Barr House in 1676. They then passed to the Balfours, Lord Sempill in 1741, John Buchanan in 1798 and Lord Blantyre of Erskine House in 1812. In 1843 Mr Maxwell of Dargevel was the proprietor of the property. In 1856 John Henderson was the owner of Rashielee Plantation and Rashielee Quarry although Rashielee Farm and offices were held by a John Hamilton Esq. The word 'Rashie' is Scots for an area or field filled with rushes. Rushielee Plantation. Rashielee Quarries The two long and narrow quarries utilised stone from two linear dikes (igneous intrusions) that run through area at least as far as the site of the old quay. Due to its hard wearing characteristics whinstone is widely used for pavements, road building, jetties, etc. Construction of the training wall known as the 'Lang Dyke' below the Erskine Bridge started in 1773. All the whinstone had to be floated down to the site on barges at the slack tide and placed underwater. The dyke was added to in later years on the west end using whinstone from the Rashielee Quarries. The whinstone from the Rashielee quarries is from the same lava flows that formed the Renfrewshire Hills. Circa 1810 its whinstone was used as stated for a westward extension of the Lang Dyke and also the anti-erosion surfacing of other training walls, etc. in the River Clyde such as the one near Bodinbo Island close to the southern side of the old Erskine Ferry. The quarries had been abandoned by 1881 when a drop in the population of the parish is recorded as being due to the unemployment caused by this closure. Some of the quarry faces are still visible from the pedestrian paths that now run through the landscaped site. Rashielee Quay =Description of the quay, dock and wagonway= Park Quay may have built with Rashielee whinstone. The quay was built to provide loading facilities for ships and punts collecting stone for use along the course of the River Clyde. In 1857 track ran from both quarries towards the quay, dividing into several sidings and ending where a crane was located and a beacon together with several berths including a dock or basin. A building was located within the eastern quarry. By 1895 the quarries were abandoned, the track lifted and the quay apparently abandoned although a crane is still marked. Rashielee Cottages are shown at a location where a building had been present when the quarries were operational. In 1939 the quay is officially marked on the OS maps as disused. The quay has been infilled and landscaped however much of the dressed stone from the old quay has been used in the landscaping. Rashielee Light stands on a cast iron cylinder close to Park Quay. Once oil fueled, it was later converted to compressed gas and now powered by electricity. WWII A WWII barrage balloon site was identified in the area however nothing now remains of the structure. Many barrage balloons existed in this part of the clyde to protect people, housing and industries against German aircraft.

Plot  Chandrakanth, a morally upright blind major, gives asylum to a man who is a fugitive, having committed murder. The murdered man was Rajinikanth, the lover of the fugitive's sister; he had cheated her on promise of marriage, leading her to commit suicide since she was unable to bear the shame. Chandrakanth's elder son Srikanth, a police officer, is tasked with finding the murderer. It is later revealed that Rajinikanth was Chandrakanth's younger son, and that both Chandrakanth and the fugitive were unaware of each other's identity the whole time. Srikanth arrests the fugitive and his father for having given shelter to a criminal.  Cast  * Major Sundarrajan as Chandrakanth * Venky as Srikanth * Gokulnath as the fugitive * P. R. Govindarajan as Rajinikanth  Production  When working in the Accountant General's office in Madras (now Chennai), K. Balachander wrote and starred as a blind major in a play titled Courage of Conviction. Since the new Accountant General was a Bengali, Balachander decided the play had to be in English so that the General would understand it. This was unlike his other plays, which were written in Tamil. He later decided to expand the play into a full-length script for his friend P. R. Govindarajan's troupe Ragini Recreations, this time in Tamil and with the title Major Chandrakanth due to the limited scope for English plays in Madras. In the Tamil play, Sundarrajan portrayed Chandrakanth (he would later be known as Major Sundarrajan for this portrayal), Venky portrayed his elder son Srikanth, Gokulnath portrayed the fugitive, and Govindarajan portrayed Rajinikanth.  Reception  The play was first staged in 1963. It received critical acclaim, and was staged over a hundred times.

Originally an indoor tennis court (jeu de paume) it was converted by the Italian designer Carlo Vigarani into a theatre which was used by Jean-Baptiste Lully's Paris Opera from 15 November 1672 to 1 February 1673.Wild 1989, p. 299; Harris-Warrick 1992, p. 856. It was located in the Rue de Vaugirard, just west of the city moat (foss√©) and the Rue des Foss√©s Monsieur-le-Prince (now the Rue Monsieur-le-Prince). Today the site of the former theatre extends into the Rue de M√©dicis, just south of no. 15 (or 13 bis) Rue de Vaugirard.Nuitter & Thoinan 1886, after p. 284. History Pierre Perrin, a poet and librettist, was given a monopoly to found an Academy of Opera in Music and French Verse on 28 June 1669.Nuitter 1886, p. 100; Clarke 2007, p. 228 (Clarke gives the year as 1770, an error); Johnson 2005, pp. 98‚Äì99. Perrin had already associated himself with Alexandre de Rieux, Marquis de Sourd√©ac, and the marquis's own associate Fran√ßois Bersac de Fondant, who styled himself Sieur de Champeron. Sourd√©ac and Champeron hired singers and took a lease on the Jeu de Paume de B√©quet. The conversion to a theatre was well advanced (an amphith√©√¢tre,A raised, sloped seating area, located behind the parterre, where spectators stood. boxes, and stage machinery had already been installed), when they were evicted for their failure to obtain proper authorisation from the police. Seeking new premises, they leased the Jeu de Paume de la Bouteille, which became the first theatre of the Paris Opera. The composer Jean Baptiste Lully persuaded Perrin to sell him his monopoly to perform opera, but this was disputed, and a royal decree in March 1672 transferred the monopoly to Lully. Unable to use the Salle de la Bouteille, since Sourd√©ac and Champeron still held the lease, Lully requested permission to use the Great Hall in the Louvre Palace on 3 June 1672. However, King Louis XIV denied that request, since the Louvre, as a royal palace, was not considered appropriate for performances that would be open to the public. As a result, on 12 August 1672, Lully acquired a lease on the B√©quet. On the same day Sourd√©ac and Champeron's right to give performances at the Bouteille was revoked. This measure was particularly punitive, since their five-year lease of the Bouteille did not end for another three years.Clarke 1998, pp. 14‚Äì16. On 23 August 1672, Lully hired the Italian stage designer Carlo Vigarani to remodel the theatre and to create the scenery for the first production, Lully's Les f√™tes de l'Amour et de Bacchus, which opened on 11 November 1672.Clarke 1998, p. 17, gives the date 15 November; Clarke 2007, p. 235, gives 11 November. This was followed by his first trag√©die lyrique, Cadmus et Hermione, on 27 April 1673. The theatre was equipped with stage machinery, but Lully regarded it as temporary. After Moli√®re died on 17 February 1673, Lully convinced King Louis XIV to allow him to use Moli√®re's theatre at the Palais-Royal free of charge.Harris-Warrick 1992, p. 856.

On December 13, 1960, he joined the army and was mobilized during the Algerian war, where he was a stretcher bearer.. Upon his return, he returned to the factory and worked in Saint-Gobain. He soon began to practice boxing and judo, and said that he'd like to become a paratrooper or a gendarme, but was subjected to vertigo and failed the tests 8 times. In 1964 he married a woman named Josiane and fathered two boys - Patrice in 1966, and Laurent in 1972. His mother, Micheline, died of cancer in 1968, followed by his two brothers. At this time he began to burglarize homes, and when driving his moped on his way back from work he would steal weapons. The deaths in Marcel's family seem to be the key events for his dive into crime and violence (his mother had both breasts removed before her death, and this trauma could have led to a desire for revenge and similar sexual rites).  Murders and the investigation  On January 10, 1969, he committed his first murder by killing Fran√ßoise Lecron, wife of a Saint-Gobain engineer, and his last murder was committed in January 1976. He attacked his victims along the railway line, striking them with a shovel then stabbing them in the heart, or would kill them using his .22 Long Rifle at nightfall (between 9PM and 11PM).. All of his victims were rumoured to be brown women, killed after he had watched them for a long time (during his days off) in order to monitor their actions. He undressed the corpses but did not violate them, and stole their handbags, which is rare among serial killers.This same rumour pushed some women in Nogent-sur-Oise to dye their hair blonde. It turned out that his victims looked like his mother (same size, hair colour, etc.). Despite this, Marcel Barbeault was regarded as a wonderful husband and an exemplary father who was self-contained and \\"banal\\". It is this schizophrenic behaviour that allowed him to pass through police nets for years. Finally, after more than 7 years of stalking, he was arrested thanks to an anonymous phone call which described him: \\"aged 35, 1.80 cm tall, married to a blonde, with two children, no driving license. He served in Algeria, has practised boxing and worked at the Rivi√®re..\\". Commissioner Christian Jacob did not identify the \\"killer\\" but he pinned Barbeault as a suspect. Inspector Daniel Neveu, freshly promoted to the judicial Police of Creil, managed to make the connection between Barbeault and the murders, through a 22 LR found in a cemetery and a rifle discovered in the basement of the accused. He found that the key to the enigma was the cemetery of Nogent-sur-Oise, which was in the center of the triangle area where all the murders took place. In addition, the double homicide of a couple occurred on the parking lot of the Laigneville cemetery. But this murder, although different from the others, was also attributed to the \\"Shadow killer\\". Inspector Neveu concluded that, unlike the others, it was not premeditated, but was more of an \\"opportunistic\\" murder - the killer was on the scene before the couple's arrival and perhaps frequented the cemetery regularly. The officer's reasoning was corroborated by the discovery of a .22LR bullet near a water tap in the cemetery. The tap was located behind the church, making it hard to find for anybody besides those who visited regularly. Neveu decided to cross out the names of the letters of denunciation and the surnames engraved on the cemetery's graves. The list of 30 names was eventually traced back to Barbeault. His beloved mother had died of breast cancer in her son's arms after much agony, and she had been buried in the Nogent cemetery since 1968.. Neveu interviewed the suspects one by one. While searching Barbeault's home in Montataire on December 14, 1976, he found in his cellar a sawed rifle with a silencer, a raincoat and various caps. Ballistic analysis revealed that the weapon was used in one of the two murders. The weapons used in the other homicides could not be found but the similar modus operandi left little doubt about a single killer. Due to Barbeault having already been sentenced for burglary in the past, the police reviewed all his crimes in the region and discovered that he had also stolen a rifle. The owner had practised shooting with the weapon in his garden, and the investigators found sockets in it, showing that they had been used for some of the murders. Authorities then pointed out that the days of the murders corresponded to those in which Barbeault had days off.  Trial and sentencing  His trial began at the Beauvais Courthouse on May 25, 1981, in the cour d'assises of Oise. Barbeault was charged with the five murders, but the three other crimes charges attributed to him were dropped due to lack of evidence. He denied being \\"The Shadow Killer\\" despite the evidence and acted coldly during the trial. The general advocate wanted to give him the death penalty, but that fell through because Fran√ßois Mitterrand had just been elected President of the Republic and announced the death penalty's upcoming abolition. Despite the five hour speech of his lawyer Jean-Louis Pelletir, Marcel Barbeault was sentenced to life imprisonment on June 10, 1981. He tried to appeal his sentence at the Court of Cassation but it was rejected in November 1983, and he was resentenced to life imprisonment. Marcel Barbeault remains incarcerated in the central prison of Saint-Maur in Indre, and is employed as the prison librarian.

Preparations On June 5, 2018, Joyce Bernal who is known for her romance comedy films, was selected to direct the 2018 State of the Nation Address. She was recommended by actor Robin Padilla to President Rodrigo Duterte with the head of state approving the suggestion. Delay and House of Representatives leadership dispute Gloria Macapagal Arroyo takes oath as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was installed as Speaker of the House of Representatives with 161 members voting for her appointment. Pantaleon Alvarez disputes the appointment and his allies blocked the declaration of the position as vacant. This caused the delay to the lower house's ratification of the Bangsamoro Organic Law. The State of the Nation Address was delayed by around 30 minutes. Program The program took 48 minutes. Address content and delivery Rodrigo Duterte opened his speech vowing to continue pursuing his controversial campaign against illegal drugs saying that he is \\"for human lives\\" criticizing human rights activists opposing the campaign. He also mentioned the Philippines partnership with Malaysia and Indonesia against piracy in their shared maritime borders as well as the country's cooperation with China against illegal drugs. Duterte added that the cooperation of the country with China doesn't mean the Philippines will stop pursuing its national interest in relation to the South China Sea dispute. In relation to the issue of endo contractualization, Duterte reiterates he cannot put a stop to the issue himself having issued Executive Order 51 on May 1, 2018, prohibiting the illegal contracting and sub-contracting of workers. He called for the Congress to pass a legislation putting an end to contractualization. The President also urged the implementation of Republic Act 11032 or the Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018 calling for the deduction of red tape in government agencies. Duterte also warned the mining industry regarding destructive mining practices saying it should be \\"used for the benefit of the Filipino people, not just a select few\\" and that complying with tax requirements isn't satisfactory compensation since he \\"can get it from other sources\\". He also condemned rice cartels for creating an artificial rice shortage and urged the Congress for the passage of a legislation relating to rice importation. The Bangsamoro Organic Law, which had its ratification by the House of Representative delayed due to a leadership dispute in the lower house, will be signed within 48 hours as per Duterte's pledge during the speech. Duterte ended the speech saying he would not bore the audience with a list of projects by the administration.

Hurst initially produced pharmaceuticals in a team working under Martha Whiteley (1866‚Äì1956), who was a prominent chemist at the Imperial College, London, and partly responsible for the development of Mustard Gas used during World War I. She was educated at the King Edward VI High School for Girls in Birmingham, and was awarded a B.Sc. (London) from Bedford College. Between 1914 and 1918 she worked at the Imperial College on synthetic drugs for the Navy and received a Diploma of Imperial College or the equivalent of an M.Sc. In 1918 she joined the Anti-Gas Department of the Ministry of Munitions under Edward Harrison, who died as a result of his experiments.https://simonjoneshistorian.com/2016/07/07/edward-harrison-who- gave-his-life-developing-protection-against-poison-gas/ For the next 30 years from 1919 to 1949 she worked in the Chemistry Department of Battersea Polytechnic. During that period she married John Wright, a consultant on high- tension power lines, and raised a family of 3 daughters. In 1949 she emigrated to South Africa where her husband was working for Eskom, the State electricity supplier, on power lines between Colenso and Durban. The erection of pylons resulted in the destruction of numerous plants, and John Wright suggested that Winifred document those, but she soon found that there was very little in the way of reference literature. Consequently she embarked on a project to describe and illustrate the wild flowers, leading to the publication of a small field guide, 'The Wild Flowers of Southern Africa - Natal - A Rambler's Pocket Guide'. Her frequent visits to the Durban Herbarium to identify plants sparked such an interest that she started research at the University of Natal into the chemistry of local flora, resulting in a Ph.D in 1954.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It was remodeled into a restaurant, and is now the home of the Mason Depot Diner. History In 1865, the Jackson, Lansing, and Saginaw Railroad laid tracks through Mason, allowing access to the Michigan Central Railroad in Jackson. The line was finished into Lansing in 1866. Michigan Central began leasing the line in 1873, and provided both freight and passenger service to Mason. In 1902, Michigan Central constructed this railroad depot on the site of the previous freight depot. It served passengers until the 1930s, and by 1945 passenger service was also terminated. After passenger service was halted, the building remained vacant for 35 years. In 1979, it was remodeled into an ice cream parlor. It was turned into a pizza restaurant, and in 1992 was turned into the Mason Depot Diner. The Diner was still operating in the building as of 2017. Description The Michigan Central Railroad Mason Depot is a one-and-one-half-story rectangular building with a hipped roof. The building is constructed of light-colored brick accented by darker brick forming a water table, frieze, corner quoins, and window and door surrounds. The building has wide overhanging eaves and a recessed central entrance flanked with pairs of windows and topped with a hipped dormer with a tripartite window. The windows are of various sizes and grouped in twos and threes, with transoms above. Some have leaded glass.

The prime target of attack, Gandapur was brought to Dera Ismail Khan in critical condition where he succumbed to his wounds. Apart from Gandapur, his driver and one of his guards was also killed and three more people were injured. Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the assault describing Gandapur's killing of their colleague militants as the motive. The attack was widely condemned across Pakistan.  Background  = Pre-election violence = Electoral candidates had been targeted since start of July to derail general elections. In the beginning of the month, a bombing took place in Ramzak Tehsil of North Waziristan at the office of Malik Aurangjeb Khan, Pakistan Movement of Justice's candidate for NA-48 (Tribal Area-IX), leaving 10 people injured. A week before the current attack in Bannu, a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely exploded at an election campaign of Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal's PK‚Äì89 candidate Shein Malik in the Takhti Khel area of the city. Two days prior to the attacks, a suicide bombing at an election rally of the Awami National Party's leader Haroon Bilour in Peshawar left 20 people, including Bilour, dead and wounded 63 others. On 12 July, the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP)'s office in Khuzdar came under gunfire before a bomb detonated injuring 2 people. 9 days before the assault, two bombings took place in Mastung and Bannu. In Bannu the bomb targeted former chief minister of KPK Akram Khan Durrani. Durrani remained unhurt but 5 people were killed and 37 others were injured. In Mastung, the prime target of the attack, Siraj Rasiani, who was to contest election on PB-35, was killed when a suicide bomber blew himself up killing 149 and injuring 186 others. = Target = Ikramullah Gandapur was main target of attack. A member of Pakistan Movement of Justice, Gandapur had served as KPK provincial minister of Agriculture and was to contest elections on PK-99. His brother and former provincial Law Minister of KPK, Israr Ullah Khan Gandapur was killed in a suicide explosion at his residence.  Prior intelligence  Soon after the Peshawar ambush, National Counter Terrorism Authority (NACTA) forwarded 12 threats to federal and provincial interior ministries, following which committee chairman Rahman Malik directed authorities to enhance security of politicians named by NACTA. In its report, NACTA named six politicians that can be targeted. The list included Durrani. The other five politicians included Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)'s chairman Imran Khan, Awami National Party leaders Asfandyar Wali and Ameer Haider Khan Hoti, Qaumi Watan Party's head Aftab Sherpao and Hafiz Saeed's son Talha Saeed. It also suggested that members of PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were under threat. Following the Mastung and Bannu attacks, Nacta warned caretaker government of more attacks before polls.  Bombing and aftermath  Gandapur was going for an election meeting when a suicide bomber, carrying around 10 kg of explosive material in his vest, blew himself up near his vehicle. As the bomb exploded, the limbs of assailant's body spread across the area. As a result, Gandapur, his driver and two of his police guards were wounded. All the injures were taken to District Headquarter Hospital (DHQ) in Dera Ismail Khan but later, citing to Gandapur's medical condition, he was taken to Combined Military Hospital (CMH) where he succumbed to his injuries. A video immediately after the attack was shot showing three unconscious injures in vehicle. Later his driver also died of his wounds. Four other people were injured. The bomb also included Ball bearing and pellets to amplify to intensity of detonation. On day after the attack, one of his guards died in DHQ raising the death toll to 3. Soon after the attack, the caretaker chief minister of KPK Dost Muhammad Khan formed a committee to investigate bombing. Headed by chief of Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), the committee included Superintendent of police (SP), Superintendent of police (SSP), Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and members from Intelligence Bureau (IB), Military Intelligence (MI) and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI). Following Gandapur's death, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) postponed elections for PK-99. = Gandapur's funeral = Gandapur's funeral took place on 23 July 2018 at the Kulachi Degree College. Strict security measures were taken citing to the attendance of many government and military figures.  Responsibility  Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. Muhammad Khurasani, organisation's spokesman said that Gandapur had killed their colleagues and his assassination was a revenge.  Reactions  Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan Nasirul Mulk condemned the attack and expressed his grief. Chief Election Commissioner Sardar Muhammad Raza extended his sympathies to families of victims. He also sought a report form acting chief minister of KPK. Chairman of Pakistan Movement of Justice Imran Khan prayed for the victims. In a tweet, Director-General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Asif Ghafoor wrote that Chief of Army staff expressed his grief over the incident.

In professor Corinna Treitel's opinion, publication of this book became one of the \\"key events\\" in history of the \\"German occult movement.\\" This book was \\"one of the first works to attempt a complete psychological explanation of all occult phenomena.\\" According to Charles Massey, one of the founders of the Society for Psychical Research, publication of this book made the \\"most brutal blow\\" out of all ones that were ever directed against Spiritualism.  Contents of the book  #The general state of the question. #The physical phenomena. #The ideality of the manifestations. #Transfigurations and materialisations. #The spirit hypothesis. = Spiritism and Spiritualism = At the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that \\"the word 'Spiritism' is of French production\\" but the English, and most part of the Germans prefer the term \\"Spiritualism.\\" The author presents to use the term \\"Spiritualism\\" to denote the metaphysical point of view, which is the opposite of materialism, and the explanation of mediumistic phenomena through participation of \\"spirits\\", he offers to call by the term \\"Spiritism.\\" He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek \\"the confirmation of their belief in immortality.\\" Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the Age of Enlightenment, as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science. = Research methodology = Hartmann writes that in order to study the \\"abnormal phenomena of human nature\\" it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in \\"experiments with an electrical friction machine\\", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the \\"investigation of abnormal phenomena.\\" He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on \\"general methodological axioms\\" which can not be \\"transgressed with impunity.\\" > \\"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second > sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will > suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose > existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should > not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as > are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation > of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do > with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent > necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends.\\" = Hypothesis of hallucinations = The study of \\"masked somnambulism,\\" as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the \\"whole area\\" of mediumistic phenomena. He explains that a \\"universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful magnetiser.\\" In his opinion, on a spiritistic s√©ance medium plunges itself into a state of \\"masked or open somnambulism.\\" Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself. Hartmann believes that \\"from the scientific psychological standpoint\\" every participator of mediumistic s√©ance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful mesmerist who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations. > \\"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of > nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those > present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely > theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put > those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that > of any magnetiser acting in the awake state.\\" According to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium \\"has the hallucination\\" of no longer being itself but of being the \\"spirit of Katie King,\\" for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is \\"Katie King.\\" He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself, because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him. The hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake. For example, about a photograph taken by William Crookes, on which can seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that \\"instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed.\\" = Hypothesis of nerve force = According to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to \\"mediumistic nerve force,\\" which is nothing else than a physical force that is \\"produced\\" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, \\"like magnetism.\\" The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the \\"fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium.\\" In addition, physical phenomena that require \\"a special strain of nerve force\\" are occurring when mediums sink into \\"an open somnambulism.\\" The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to \\"the most striking phenomena\\" of mediumship‚Äîthey had been surpassed only cases of \\"matter's penetration through matter.\\" He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but \\"an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,\\" and explains this phenomenon as follows: > \\"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the > mediumistic nerve force‚Äîan arrangement corresponding to those pressures that > are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance > capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of > matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistented with > that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an > organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of > producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind.\\" Some of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines \\"the hallucination of the emerging image\\" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this displacement \\"with the help of his mediumistic nerve force,\\" while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the \\"transfer of his hallucination to the audience,\\" he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination. = Mental manifestations = Regarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only \\"the somnambulistic consciousness\\" can be the source of their content. He writes, \\"All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium.\\" As a rule, this level happens to be \\"below the spiritual level\\" of the medium and participants of the s√©ance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher. The author writes that some mediums, with their \\"mimic transfigurations\\", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases \\"in strange, incomprehensible dialects\\", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this. According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can \\"produce automatic writing or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand].\\" = Explanation of paranormal = In principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of \\"the penetration of matter\\", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer Z√∂llner about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather, the statement \\"on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three- dimensional space.\\" According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, \\"nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions.\\" After the mentioning to the \\"expansive action\\" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the \\"cohesion of material particles\\" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to \\"penetration of matter\\", classifying them as \\"an especially incredible field of phenomena.\\" He refers to the confirmed experiments of Z√∂llner and the facts of \\"a transference\\" of objects into a locked room, which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of \\"the penetration of matter\\": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with \\"sealed\\" ends, the bringing into the s√©ance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room. According to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the \\"mediumistic nerve force\\" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of clairvoyance, there is no need to go \\"beyond the bounds of the natural explanations.\\" = On hypothesis of spirits = In conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism: > \\"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, > after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena > of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the > manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. > Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any > case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from > which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world.\\"  Criticism  One of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was Alexander Aksakov. The proofs which Aksakov used to \\"disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis\\" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures \\"taken during the s√©ances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible,\\" were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is \\"an objective phenomenon\\", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal Sphinx, where \\"Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors.\\" Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were \\"completely unknown\\" to him. A materialised figure and medium in trance. Photo by A. N. Aksakov. William Crookes, Katie King, and hers medium. Professor Alfred Lehmann wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on s√©ance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the s√©ance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is \\"scientifically untenable.\\" Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force, Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to \\"the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density\\" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced \\"by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium,\\" that is, by the materialised form. Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force \\"can cause thermal and light phenomena,\\" for example, it can produce certain forms, \\"at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it.\\" Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed \\"by his own logic.\\" In connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that \\"the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts.\\" Karl Du Prel brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: \\"Since I never attended a s√©ance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher.\\" Then he commented on this passage as follows: > \\"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the > philosopher'‚Äîto remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one > could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been > silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict > lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has > certainly contributed to eristic but not in philosophy.\\"  Interesting facts  * A Russian translation of the book was performed by the famous chemist Alexander Butlerov.

Formed in mid-1919 as the 6th Consolidated Rifle Division but soon redesignated, it fought against the Ukrainian People's Army on the Southern Front, retreating north and taking heavy losses. In late 1919 it advanced southwest into western Ukraine, where it fought in the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War as part of the Southwestern Front in 1920. Postwar, the division was reduced to a brigade and merged into the 24th Rifle Division in April 1921.  History  The division was formed by orders of 20 and 25 July 1919 with the 14th Army as the 6th Consolidated Rifle Division from the 1st and 2nd Consolidated and 1st Ural Brigades. It was renumbered as the 60th Rifle Division on 10 August, and fought in defensive battles against the Ukrainian People's Army on the left-bank of the Dnieper near Kremenchug, Zolotonosha, Yagotin, Darnitsa, Brovary, and Kozelets during August. It left the 14th Army on 14 August, being reduced to a rifle brigade due to heavy losses in September. The brigade was restored to division strength on 16 September with the personnel of the 2nd Penza and Kiev Fortress Brigades, joining the 12th Army on 16 September. It fought against the Ukrainian People's Army on the Desna between September and November. From November to February 1920 it fought in the recapture of Chernigov, Bakhmach, Cherkassy, and Kremenchug. The division transferred back to the 14th Army of the Southwestern Front on 13 February, and fought in the battles near Zhmerynka and Vapniarka until April. It defended the line of the Zbruch and the Seret between May and August during the Polish‚ÄìSoviet War. On 30 November the division briefly returned to the 12th Army as the 14th Army disbanded, but on 25 December joined the Kiev Military District after the former was itself disbanded. On 28 April 1921, by an order of the Kiev Military District, it was reduced to a brigade, which was incorporated into the 24th Rifle Division.

Soon the young talented player continued his career: First in Jadran Herceg Novi where he competed in the senior squad coached by famous Montenegrin water polo player Vladimir Gojkoviƒá who is currently the coach of the Montenegro men's national water polo team. Second foreign team for the Georgian was CN Barcelona (40 Spanish Championship titles, 19 Spanish League titles), playing Divisi√≥n de Honor de Waterpolo, coached by famous Spanish water polo player and coach Toni Esteller. After clinching the 6th place with CN Barcelona in the national championship, Bitadze continued his career in Rome, becoming the youngest foreign player in Serie A1 for the 2016/2017 season, scoring 9 goals. In the end of the season Roma Vis Nova lost play-out matches and the team was relegated in Serie A2. For the 2017/2018 season Andria remained in Roma Vis Nova (coach Alessandro Calcaterra) as the only foreign player in the team scoring 18 goals and clinching the 7th place in the championship. In September 2018 he signed a new contract with a Serbian giant VK Crvena zvezda, the team coached by a legendary player and one of the best coaches in water polo history Dejan Saviƒá, where he was a runner-up of Serbian water polo national championship. LEN announced a list of clubs which got wild cards for the 2018/19 Champions League Preliminary round. One of the teams is Crvena Zvezda, this will be the debut for the current format of the championship. VK Crvena zvezda won their first and only title in 2012/2013 LEN Champions League season.

Part of the Karst Plateau, the museum is an ecologically-important area with many karst features. It was recognized as Slovenia's best thematic trail in 2017, and the region is a Natura 2000 site.  Overview  The museum covers over between Se≈æana, Lipica and the Slovene-Italian border, along the old Austro-Hungarian road from Se≈æana to Bazovizza. The area was closed to the public for almost half a century. Today it includes of cross-border walking and cycling trails. On the Slovene side, the trail starts near the Se≈æana fire station. It is located at .  Environment  Typical karst phenomena in the area are sinkholes, uvalas, limestone pavement, chasms, and caves. Natural processes created geomorphological features which became characteristic of karst: soluble corrosion of limestone as a consequence of the chemical action of water, carbon dioxide, and organic acids. Limestone shapes have specific names, such as rills (≈ælebiƒçi), karrens (≈°kraplje, ≈°kraplij≈°ƒça), kamenitzas (≈°kaune), stone tables known as mushrooms, and hums (osamelci); boulders are known as gri≈æe. Other features of karst terrain are shallow valleys (dolinice) and deeper ones, which may be round and elongated or dish- or step-shaped. Small sinkholes are known as vrtaƒçe; deeper, larger sinkholes are known as udorne doline. They were created hundreds of thousands of years ago in the Late Pleistocene, during the gradual collapse of cave ceilings. Karst formations The Golokratna jama cave is a dry sinkhole in the region, which has no surface water. Watercourses disappear below ground, forming caves. The karst caves have a number of calcareous formations, rock shapes and sediments, mainly cave clay. Some underground watercourses have not changed direction. In 2003, explorers from the Se≈æana Society for Cave Exploration reached the underground Reka River in Kanjaduce Cave and followed it for about . A year later, they reached the Reka at a depth of through a shaft in the Str≈°inkna Valley.  Biodiversity  Shepherd's hut For centuries, the native karst vegetation has resisted the bora and drought on its shallow soil. Biodiversity includes sub-Mediterranean vegetation, with xerophilic Illyrian species and Central European vegetation. Typical vegetation includes the common houseleek, wild asparagus, mountain anemone, wild peony, and hellebore; crocuses are found in the Lipica area. Cowslips and other high-altitude plants grow on the slopes of Orle≈°ka Draga. Other flowers include violets, primroses, lilies of the valley, daffodils, golden daisies, peonies, and cyclamen. The landscape of Lipica is characterized by several species of oak (downy oak, turkey oak and durmast oak). Mistletoe lives on the trees. Field maples and lindens also grow around the village. Other deciduous trees include the hop and common hornbeam, ash, hazel, and wild cherry. Shrubs include blackthorn, juniper, smoke tree, barberry, common elder and mahaleb cherry. The karst forest is also home to many animal species, including roe deer, brown hares, squirrels, dormice, badgers, wild boars and common deer. Nocturnal predators include foxes, wild cats, beech marten, weasels, jackals, wolves and brown bears. Birds include the titmouse, nuthatch, jay, black woodpecker, crow, little owl and other rare and endangered species: eagle owl, scops owl, skylark, nightjar, hoopoe, honey buzzard and short-toed snake eagle. Bats and rock doves live on the rocky slopes. In the dark, underground streams and lakes (including the shaft in the Str≈°inkna Valley), the olm (Proteus anguina) and other underground fauna have been found. Karst common land is home to the horned viper, black snake and green, and sand lizard. Grass snakes inhabit ponds; slowworms inhabit cultivated areas, and rat and Aesculapian snakes inhabit abandoned buildings. The region is also home to the green whip snake and common wall lizard.  History  For centuries the only source of water for the karst people were ponds (kali) and wells (≈°tirne), which provided potable water for households and livestock. Ponds were built in natural basins, with the slope leveled and the bottom deepened. A layer of clay was laid down and pressed into the soil to seal the bottom. The clay was protected by a stone liner (≈°krle ‚Äì flat stones or slate). Cattle pressed the stone as they drank, preserving the seal. Villagers met near ponds, and children skated on the ice in winter. The ponds were used to obtain ice, which was stored in ice houses (ledenice). In summer, the ice was brought to Trieste. A preserved ice house with steps is near the pond at Lipica Stud Farm. Rainwater was collected in cisterns. The preserved Se≈æana‚ÄìOrlek cistern, built on common land (gmajna), has a diameter of about and is deep. A two-sided staircase leads into the cistern. Nineteenth-century cisterns were built in the ≈†tirna Valley and Orlek, which has two: the 1881 cistern and one which is over 250 years old. A village community well was built in 1880. Rainwater was collected from the nearby roofs and fed through a canal and clay pipes into the well; excess water was collected in a pond. People without a well of their own used water from the village well. Wealthier people built wells on their property. The wells were dug, surrounded by small stones and sealed with clay. The region's water supply was improved with the 1982 construction of a pipeline from Brestovica to Komen. Stone shepherds' huts are a local example of folk architecture. The huts, which shelter shepherds from wind and rain, are free-standing or built against boulders or walls. Small huts have room for two or three people, and larger huts can accommodate seven. Dry stone walls, without mortar or other binders, are characteristic of karst architecture. While clearing pastures and meadows, people built walls with the stones they removed. Stone markers denoted administrative boundaries and land ownership.  Archaeology, paleontology and geology  The region is an archaeological site, with findings of fossils, animal bones and ancient artefacts. In the Ludvikova jama cave near Orlek vicinity of Orlek, fossilsed Pleistocene animal bones of a wolverine (Gulo gulo, the largest marten, which presently lives in the Arctic and subarctic. Other prehistoric sites are the Jama v Partu pri Ogradi cave, the rock of Krnavica and the Malenca rock shelter, where earthenware, coal and the remains of sheep, goats and deer have been found. In the Jama v se≈æanski gmajni cave, late-Roman earthenware fragments have been found. Cretaceous fossils have also been found. A collection of karst, from the over-100-million-year-old Brje limestone formation to the shallow-water rocks of the Povir formation and Komen limestone (with fossils of fish and reptiles) is in the Se≈æana botanical garden. There is typical rudist limestone, flat limestone with well-preserved fossils and abundant chert, an essential soil ingredient for terrano cultivation. The sedimentation environment was favourable for the creation of thin layers of bituminous coal. The museum also has several layers of flysch.Stanislav Renƒçelj (March 2017). \\"Karst Living Museum\\". Project Kras- Carso.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. It is one of the earliest structures existing in Mason. History In 1840, John and Emma Rayner moved from Auburn, New York, to Mason with their three children. Rayner was interested in farming as well as land speculation, and he purchased 320 acres of land at the site of this house, at that time east of Mason. Rayner likely began the construction of this house immediately in 1840. The Raynors lived here for many years before retiring to another home in Mason, located on the corner of Barnes and Oak. John Raynor died in 1879; at the time of his death he owned thousands of acres and was called \\"one of the most opulent men of the county.\\" The Raynor's son A. J. Rayner served in the Civil War and attended the State Normal School (now Eastern Michigan University) before continuing his father's career in land speculation. John and Emma Raynor's second son Charles J. Rayner was also involved in real estate. Their daughter Emma Rayner Wheeler Reed, along with her brothers and second husband, constructed the Rayner Opera House in 1880-81 as a memorial to their father. Description The Rayner House is a brick Upright and Wing house with a two-story upright and one-story wing, along with a frame ell at the rear containing a kitchen. The main entrance is in the front of the upright and is flanked with sidelights. The house has gently sloping gable roofs with wide frieze boards, gable returns and fanlights in the gable peaks. There are two windows on the upper story of the main wing and two on the first floor. The wing section has a large picture window that was originally a door, and a smaller window. The foundation of the upright has a front section made of small, rounded cobbles laid in courses, exemplifying early nineteenth- century cobblestone construction most commonly seen in central and western New York.

Since 1985 he has developed rule-based language technology mainly for Swahili, but also for other languages, including machine translation from English to Finnish. He has created a development environment called SALAMA (acronym for Swahili Language Manager), but it suits to any language. The major applications developed so far include the following: the spell checker for Swahili, the annotator of corpus texts, an advanced dictionary between Swahili and English and translators from Swahili to English, from English to Swahili, and from English to Finnish. He has also developed an advanced learning system for Swahili and a system for producing targeted vocabularies for language learners. Hurskainen has compiled two annotated corpora, Helsinki Corpus of Swahili 1.0 and Helsinki Corpus of Swahili 2.0.  Study and work history  He first studied theology at the University of Helsinki. Later, after having worked in Tanzania, he studied anthropology and published his PhD dissertation Cattle and Culture. The Structure of a Pastoral Parakujo Society. In 1976 he worked as a researcher in Jipemoyo Project, sponsored by the Academy of Finland in Tanzania, and in 1977‚Äì1980 in the service of the Finnish Lutheran Mission in Helsinki. Hurskainen worked at the University of Helsinki, first as a lecturer in 1981‚Äì1989 and then as a professor in 1989‚Äì2006. In between, in 1984‚Äì1985 he worked at Tumaini University in Tanzania. Before the university career, he worked in Tanzania for eight years in various teaching tasks. He was the director of the Department of Asian and African Studies in 1999‚Äì2001. He retired in 2006. In 1988‚Äì1992 he directed the fieldwork project Swahili Language and Folklore, sponsored by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Finland and the University of Dar-es-Salaam. The project produced the speech corpus DAHE (Dar-es-Salaam - Helsinki), which was later digitized.  Language technology  Hurskainen has developed language technology by making use of detailed language analysis. The basic description of language is made using the finite-state transducers, first developed by Kimmo Koskenniemi. The individual words are then disambiguated using constraint grammar technology. Also, the syntactic mapping is performed in this phase. Disambiguation and syntactic mapping are performed using Constraint Grammar 3.0, originally developed by Fred Karlsson and implemented by Pasi Tapanainen from Connexor. The rule-based approach developed by Hurskainen has similarities with other rule-based systems, such as Grammatical Framework and Nooj. Rule-based approaches to language technology, especially as they apply to machine translation, are considered suitable for low-resource languages with rich morphology, such as Bantu languages.Hurskainen, Arvi. 2018.

The cross possibly marks the site of the founder's shrine in what would have been an original Manx Keeil. In connection with St Trinian's Church there was an independent barony,Isle of Man Examiner, Saturday, 1 August 1903; Page: 3 whose tenants owed no immediate fealty to the King of Mann, though the Baron was the King's vassal. The barony lands were given by King Olaf II of Man in or about the year 1230, and successive charters or confirmations refer to the church of St Ninian and the hospitals at Ballacgniba and Balhamer.Isle of Man Times, Saturday, 21 September 1940; Page: 7 The Barony of St Trinian's therefore consisted of a religious house, the hospitals (or guest houses) and the church.Isle of Man Examiner, Friday, 25 September 1953; Page: 6 All the time the monks were at St Trinian's it may be assumed that the church was to all intents and purposes the parish church. The church belonged to the Priory of Whithorn, in modern Dumfries and Galloway. Traditionally the plan of the old Manx churches is in proportion to that of St Trinian's: the length is about three times the breadth. After the collapse of the religious house the church was moved to a site on the hill beside the Rocky Lane above Ellerslie Farm, which was established as Old St Runius. There was certainly an earlier church on this site, but the structure which stands there today undoubtedly contains a great deal of material removed from St Trinian's. By the late 19th century and into the early 20th century, St Trinian's Church had become a popular venue for Sunday School picnics. For the first time in many hundreds of years divine service was conducted at St Trinian's on 4 September 1911. Contemporary reports state that a large number of people attended: far too many to be accommodated inside the chapel. The Bishop of Sodor and Man officiated, accompanied by the Lieutenant Governor of the Isle of Man, Lord Raglan, who read the lesson, and the Reverend Clarke who read the prayers. Lady Raglan also attended; the Crosby Brass Band accompanied the singing. This led to other occasions when the church was used for worship. In September 1916 St Trinian's was used as one of the locations for the filming of The Manxman, a film based on the novel by Hall Caine.Peel City Guardian, Saturday, 23 September 1916; Page: 8 Caine lived in Greeba Castle, adjacent to St Trinian's. Despite more fanciful folk tales to the contrary, the most probable reason why the church remained unfinished is that it was being built some time in the early 14th century, while the island was under the rule of the Scots. Construction may well have halted in 1343, when William Montagu, 1st Earl of Salisbury, conquered the island and expelled its Scottish owners,Holiday News, Saturday, 2 August 1958; Page: 10 who would have included the monks of Whithorn Priory. The Buggane of St Trinian's St Trinian's Church with Greeba Mountain in the background A renowned Manx folk tale tells of the big Buggane, a supernatural being which lived on Greeba Mountain, and strongly objected to the church roof being completed. Every time a roof was put on the chapel, the Buggane would come down from the mountain and throw it off. On the last occasion of the roof being almost finished, legend says that a young tailor named Timothy ClucasIsle of Man Times, Wednesday, 29 October 1890; Page: 3 wagered he would sit in the church all night and make a pair of breeches in order to exorcise the troublesome ogre. The Buggane rose from the ground, taunting Timothy, who did not look up but carried on stitching the breeches for all he was worth. Before the Buggane's taunts were finished, Timothy completed the breeches, and jumped out of the church just as the roof crashed in, dropping his needle and scissors as he made good his escape. The fiendish laugh of the Buggane arose behind him as he bounded off in flight, to which terror lent its utmost speed. Looking behind him he saw the Buggane closing on him, extending its jaws as if to swallow him alive. To escape its fury Timothy leaped into consecrated ground; bugganes were unable to stand on consecrated ground. In a fit of anger the Buggane ripped off its head and threw it at Timothy, where it exploded like a bomb. Timothy was unscathed, but the church of St Trinian has remained to this day without a roof. The Rev. Phillip Moore born in 1705; he was for 46 years chaplain of Douglas; he preached at Bishop Wilson's funeral and was a curate of Marown. He got into Bishop Wilson's bad books when one night he masqueraded on the ruins of St Trinian's to scare the country people and to show them how wrong they were in believing in the mythical story of the Buggane.

Flaggers are one of the several neo-Confederate groups active in the Southern United States. Flaggers usually operate at the state level. Their primary purpose is to make the Confederate battle flag as visible as possible. Group members carry the flag, which is listed as a hate symbol by the Anti-Defamation League, at demonstrations and other public events, and erect it on private land. These flags are frequently visible from major highways, and have often been the subject of controversy and legal efforts to have them removed. Members, usually acting individually, also lobby or appear at meetings to speak against removal of Confederate monuments and memorials. Some are anti-Abraham Lincoln and for the right of states to secede, i.e., that the Confederacy was legitimate under U.S. law. Georgia origin of flaggers The earliest documentation of a flagger group as an organization is the Virginia Flaggers, whose Web site says they were founded in 2011. However, the flagger movement first appeared, spontaneously and unorganized, in Georgia in 2001. The flag of Georgia from 1956 to 2001 incorporated the Confederate battle flag. Responding in part to pressure from civil rights groups who threatened an economic boycott of Georgia, Governor Roy Barnes \\"ramrodded\\" a flag change bill through the Legislature. The new, hastily-designed flag, which even many of its supporters thought ugly, was in use from 2001 to 2003. It included the 1956 flag (the design of which contained the Confederate battle flag) and four others, a subset of Georgia's numerous past flags. The North American Vexillological Association called it the worst-designed state flag in the country. There was widespread opposition to the new flag, deemed the \\"Barnes flag\\". It led, according to Barnes himself, to his defeat for reelection two years later; the flag was a major issue in the election. A new flag was designed. In a non-binding 2004 referendum, 73% of the voters expressed a preference for the new flag, based on the first Confederate national flag, the Stars and Bars, over the 2001 design. (A return to the 1956 flag with the Confederate battle flag, desired by some, was not on the ballot.) Flaggers, as they were soon called, began displaying the Confederate battle flag, or the 1956 Georgia flag which contained it, in 2001. They appeared at political rallies and at public appearances of legislators who had voted for the Barnes flag. Current flagger groups As of 2018, the active flagger groups are: * Virginia Flaggers, formed in 2011, have installed Confederate flags across the state: according to their Web site, 31 as of April 2020. * Tennessee Confederate Flaggers * Alabama Flaggers * Delta (Mississippi) Flaggers, who make a point of demonstrating in front of businesses, schools, or any organization that does not fly the Mississippi flag (which contains the Confederate Battle Flag). * Georgia Flaggers * \\"The Sons of Confederate Veterans aims to raise a Confederate flag in all 100 counties in North Carolina in an initiative called 'Flags Across the Carolinas.' The initiative hopes to raise 'mega-sized,' Confederate battle flags across the state by placing them on private properties with the consent of the property owners.\\" A separate group, Alamance County Taking Back Alamance County (ACTBAC), which was identified in 2016 and again in 2017 as a \\"neo-Confederate\\" hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, sought to do the same at four locations surrounding Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

History The Westside Neighborhood Historic District is part of the Barnes and Price Addition, which was platted in 1866. Development began in the 1870s, with many of the hoses in the district being constructed in the late 1800s. Early residents were business and professional people, including two tinsmiths, an undertaker, a foundry owner, a carpenter, a physician, and a retired city attorney. Description The Westside Neighborhood Historic District is a roughly rectangular area that includes one block of West Maple and one block of West Ash, as well as the city park along both sides of Sycamore Creek. The district includes 47 structures, primarily single-family homes of frame construction, built in the late 19th century. The houses are sited on large lots along tree-lines streets, and are set back from the road. The homes are primarily Colonial Revival and Queen Anne styles, but also include vernacular Greek Revival and Italianate structures. The Mason City Park is a landscaped area that has been used since the early history of the city. The district also includes an 1888 stone arch railroad bridge constructed over Sycamore Creek, and a concrete arch bridge on Maple Street. Significant structures include: * Harlow A. Beech House (452 West Maple): This house is a two-story Queen Anne structure constructed in 1887 for Harlow A. Beech, the owner-operator of an iron foundry. It has a clipped-gable roof and clapboard and ship-lap siding with a projecting second story. * Augustus A. Howard House (451 West Ash Street): This house is a two-story, vernacular structure constructed in 1878/9 for Augustus A. Howard, who owned a local grocery. Around the turn of the century, the house was purchased by Sidney and Anna Culver, who added a two-story rear wing. * Joseph P. Smith House (414 West Maple): This house is a two-story multi -gabled Queen Anne constructed in 1889 for Joseph P. Smith, a tinsmith, and his wife Lillian. They lived in the house until 1922. It has substantial decoration and an elaborately decorated porch. * James Fred and Lizzie Lewis House (427 West Maple): This house was constructed in 1890 for James and Lizzie Lewis. In 1891, it was purchased by John c. Fingerle, who was a partner in a hardware business. It is a modest two-story cross-gabled Queen Anne structure with fishscale shingling in the gable peaks. * James A. Sherwood House (404 West Maple): This house was constructed in 1893 for contractor and lumber dealer James A. Sherwood. It is an L-shaped, two-story multi-gabled house with clapboard siding and fishscale shingles. * George W. Bristol House (439 West Ash Street): This house was constructed in 1912 for George W.

She won twenty-three Australian national championships, was an Olympian, represented at five World Championships over a twelve-year period and won a silver medal at the 1990 World Rowing Championships. Club and state rowing Westendorf started her rowing career as a schoolgirl in Dimboola, Victoria. Her senior club rowing was from the Dimboola Rowing Club and later from the Melbourne University Boat Club.Westendorf Profile at Guerin Foster Westendorf first made Victorian state representation as a 15 year old in 1974 Colts series raced against New Zealand.Whitehouse Profile at Guerin Foster In 1977 at the Australian Rowing Championships she won a women's junior four title in Dimboola colours with Leeanne Whitehouse with whom she would share later state and national honours.1977 Austn C'ships She was selected for Victoria at the senior level in 1977 in the women's heavyweight four which contested the ULVA Trophy at the Interstate Regatta within the Australian Rowing Championships. . She rowed in eight consecutive Victorian crews contesting the ULVA Trophy up till 1984. Seven of those crews were victorious including the three from 1982 to 1984 which Westendorf stroked. By 1987 Westendorf had shifted down to the lightweight division and selected in the Victorian lightweight coxless four which contested and won the Victoria Cup at the Interstate Regatta. She raced and won that event again in 1990 and 1991. In 1992 she rowed her last State appearance for Victoria ‚Äì back in the heavyweight coxless four. She rowed in Dimboola Rowing Club colours contesting and winning three Australian national titles in 1982 in the pair, the four and the eight.1982 Austn C'ships She won in the pair and the eight in 1983 and the pair, four and eight in 1984.1983 Austn C'ships By 1987 she was representing Melbourne University as a lightweight and won the coxless four national title at the Australian Rowing Championships in 1987.

Westendorf at World Rowing In 1979 at the World Championships in Bled she rowed a coxed four to a fifth place. The 1980 Summer Olympics were only the second time that women's rowing featured in the Olympic programme. The selection of the members of this crew was clear as it comprised the two fastest pairs and the fastest four in domestic racing. Their coach was the experienced Victorian, David Palfreyman. The coxless four performed as well as any other Australian crew at the Olympic regatta and was clearly the best western nation crew at that time. The coxed four including Pam Westendorf in the three seat rowed to a fifth placing. Westendorf rowed on after the Olympics and at the 1981 World Rowing Championships in Munich she raced a coxless pair with Jacqueline Marshall to overall eight place. They stayed together as a pair into 1982 still coached by Palfreyman and again raced at World Championships, this time to ninth place. After a number of years out of national crews, Westendorf was back in the Australian coxless four for her final representative appearance at the 1990 World Rowing Championships in Lake Barrington. She won her first and only World Championship medal ‚Äì a silver. Coach Post-competitive rowing Westendorf has had a long coaching career at school, club and state level. She coached the 1994 Victorian state women's coxless four and the Victorian state women's youth eight in 1995. In 1994 she coached an Australian women's U23 coxless four who contested the Trans-Tasman series. She has coached school crews at both Geelong College and at Geelong Grammar School.

Several years previous, the Houston Carnegie Library and Lyceum barred Smith and several of his African-American colleagues from entering the facility. They responded by founding the Colored Carnegie Library to serve African-Americans, run by its own trustees and management.Malone (1999), p. 95.

For much of its existence, it was the southern passenger terminus of the Londonderry, Seaham and Sunderland Railway but declined in importance after the opening of the nearby Seaham Colliery station and the extension of the line to West Hartlepool (avoiding Seaham Harbour station) by that company's successor.  History  In 1854 the Londonderry Railway opened the Londonderry, Seaham and Sunderland Railway to link its network of colliery railways to the newly constructed South Dock in Sunderland due to the lack of capacity in Seaham Harbour. Though constructed primarily for mineral traffic, passengers were also carried on this line from 1855 and stations were opened at either end of the line. At the Seaham end of the line, a station was constructed on Marlborough Street and was originally named Seaham whilst at the Sunderland end, Hendon Burn station was constructed close to the staithes in the South Dock. From 1868, LS&SR; began to use the Hendon terminus of the North Eastern Railway (NER) before that was in turn closed by the NER in 1879 to be replaced by Sunderland Central station and all LS&SR; services were once again diverted into the new station. The LS&SR; did, however, remain independent until the Londonderry Railway agreed to sell its Seaham to Sunderland route to the NER in the Act of 30 July 1900 though this sale did not include Station Hotel which was attached to the Seaham station and had direct entrance from the station platform; the hotel remained under the ownership of the Marquess of Londonderry. The NER took over operation of the route on 6 October 1900 and then, on 1 April 1905 opened an extension of it along the coast to meet the former Hartlepool Dock & Railway at . However all through trains to West Hartlepool over the extension, left the original LS&SR; passenger route just to the north of the original Seaham terminus, serving the new Seaham Colliery station instead and thus leaving the original Seaham station as the terminus of local trains to and from Sunderland. In the 1923 grouping, the NER was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER). As part of an agreement which allowed them to close the Marquess' private station at , the LNER renamed both the original Seaham station and the later Seaham Colliery station on 1 March 1925, with the original station becoming Seaham Harbour and the later station becoming Seaham. Under the LNER, Seaham Harbour station retained a fairly frequent service of 14 trains per day, despite it having been superseded as the town's main station until it was closed as a wartime economy measure on 11 September 1939 and never reopened. The station buildings remained until they were demolished in 1971.

He showed moderate ability as a two-year-old in 1883 when he won one minor race from two starts. In the following year he was well beaten on his debut but then won the Esher Stakes before finishing second when matched against top-class French opposition in the Grand Prix de Paris. At Doncaster Racecourse in September he was able to exploit his superior fitness to record his biggest success in the St Leger, beating the winner of that year's 2000 Guineas and Epsom Derby. In two subsequent races he finished second in the Doncaster Cup and came home unplaced in the Cesarewitch. As a breeding stallion he had no success as a sire of winners but did exert an enduring influence on the breed though his daughter Standon Girl. Background The Lambkin was a \\"great, leathering\\" bay horse bred in England by Mr Clare Vyner. He was owned during his racing career by Vyner's brother Robert, who inherited him on Clare's death. The colt was sent into training with Mathew Dawson at the Heath House stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was one of the best horses sired by Camballo, who was trained by Dawson to win the 2000 Guineas in 1875. The Lambkin's dam Mint Sauce went on to produce the 1000 Guineas winner Minthe (also by Camballo) and Minting. Racing career =1883: two-year-old season= The Lambkin made a successful racecourse debut when he won a Rous Plate worth ¬£397 at Doncaster Racecourse. On his only other start of the year he ran unplaced in the Chesterfield Nursery Handicap. =1884: three-year-old season= Mathew Dawson, The Lambkin's trainer The Lambkin's first appearance of 1884 came on April when he started a 25/1 outsider for the City and Suburban Handicap over ten furlongs at Epsom Racecourse carrying 84 pounds and finished ninth behind the five-year-old Quicklime. Fred Archer took the ride at Sandown Park Racecourse in May when the colt started at odds of 4/1 in an eight-runner field and showed much improved form to win from the favourite Acrostic. On 8 June The Lambkin contested the ¬£4,000 Grand Prix de Paris over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse. With Archer again in the saddle he finished second to the Prix du Jockey Club winner Little Duck with the Grand Crit√©rium winner Fra Diavolo in third place. The Lambkin was then trained for the St Leger. The hot, dry weather led to the turf at Newmarket becoming exceptionally hard and while many of the leading horses of the year were either injured or prevented from training, The Lambkin appeared to thrive and had no difficulty maintaining his fitness by galloping on the \\"adamant\\" ground. At Doncaster on 10 September The Lambkin was one of thirteen three- year-olds to contest the 109th running of the St Leger over fourteen and half furlongs. Absent from the race were the season's two best colts St. Gatien (who had never been entered for the race) and St Simon (whose entry had been invalidated by the death of his owner). The race took place in fine, sunny weather and attracted a large crowd. Before the race Captain Machell attempted to have the horse disqualified from starting on the grounds that he had been entered for the race by Robert Vyner when he was still in the ownership of the terminally ill Clare Vyner, but the objection was not sustained by the stewards. An open betting heat saw Scot Free start the 4/1 favourite ahead of Superba (second in the Oaks Stakes), Harvester and Sir Reuben (Prince of Wales's Stakes), with The Lambkin, ridden by John Watts being made the 9/1 fifth choice. After several false starts the race began with The Lambkin at the rear of the field, but Watts moved him forward to settle behind the leaders before taking second place behind Hermitage with half a mile left to run. The Lambkin took the lead soon afterwards and entered the straight with a clear advantage from Sir Reuben, Superba and the 40/1 outsider Sandiway. He was briefly headed by Superba but rallied to regain the advantage as the filly faltered and in a \\"stoutly-contested\\" race he prevailed by a length from Sandiway with Superba three quarters of a length back in third. As the Vyner family originated in Yorkshire the victory was met with \\"noisy revelry\\" by the crowd who regarded the winner a \\"one of their own\\". Another individual with cause to celebrate was the Prince of Wales who had reportedly wagered heavily on The Lambkin. Two days later at the same track, The Lambkin was stepped up in distance and matched against older horses in the two mile, five furlong Doncaster Cup. He finished second to the French six-year-old Louis d'Or with third place going to the 1883 St Leger winner Ossian. At Newmarket on 7 October The Lambkin carried a weight of 116 pounds and started at odds of 100/6 for the Cesarewitch over two and a quarter miles. He began to struggle six furlongs from the finish and was unplaced in a race won by St Gatien. The Lambkin ended the year with winnings of ¬£5,316. Stud record The Lambkin was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion but made no impact a sire of winners. He did, however sire Standon Girl, a broodmare whose female- line descendants have included Peleid, Treasure Beach, Hethersett, Neasham Belle, Doyoun, Alexandrova and Humble Duty. The Lambkin died in May 1900. Pedigree *The Lambkin was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Orlando meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

D'Ari√®s had only 1,000 men, while the Vietnamese commander Nguy·ªÖn Tri Ph∆∞∆°ng had 10,000 fresh troops in Gia ƒê·ªãnh Province. During his term of office the Vietnamese frequently attacked the Saigon garrison during the Siege of Saigon, and d'Ari√®s put most of his energy into maintaining access to the sea. D'Ari√®s had 800 men under his command, including 200 Spanish, as well as two corvettes and four smaller sailing ships. He developed a series of rural fortifications to protect Saigon and Cholon, each with 80 howitzers and 30 rifles. He held office until 6 February 1861 when Admiral L√©onard Charner took over command. After the Anglo- French forces defeated the Chinese in the Battle of Palikao in October 1860 Charner was able to bring 70 warships of the Far East fleet to help d'Aries, with 3,500 French and Spanish troops led by General √âlie de Vassoigne. Vassoigne's forces stormed Gia ƒê·ªãnh on 7 February 1861 and after two days of intense fighting in the Battle of Ky Hoa (24‚Äì25 February 1861) took Ky Hoa fortress, from Saigon. At Ky Hoa the French found large stores of rice, 2,000 French rifles from Saint-√âtienne and 500 heavy guns. Nguyen Tri Phuong retired to Bi√™n H√≤a and the French occupied M·ªπ Tho. Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c decided to negotiate a truce. D'Ari√®s became a Commander of the Legion of Honour on 22 April 1861. Under the June 1862 Treaty of Saigon D'Ari√®s ceded the Vƒ©nh Long citadel in the Mekong Delta to Phan Thanh Gi·∫£n. At the start of 1863 and 1864 he was deputy Chef de division in Cochinchina. =Later career (1869‚Äì78)= On 1 January 1869 d'Ari√®s was stationed in Toulon. He was promoted to contre- amiral (counter admiral) on 4 February 1872. In June 1872 he was a member of the Lighthouse Committee. In 1874 he was major of the 2nd maritime division in Brest. He entered the reserve on 22 January 1875. D'Ari√®s died on 6 December 1878 in Tillac, aged 65.

She was a member of the left- wing Parti ouvrier et populaire (as the Swiss \\"Labour party\\" is known in parts of the French speaking region of the country). In 1959 Marceline Mi√©ville became the first woman in Switzerland to be accepted (initially) as a candidate in a federal (national) election. Her candidature was rejected subsequently, however. Her own canton of Vaud became the first canton, in February 1959, to endorse votes for women in cantonal and national elections, but across the country the 1959 referendum had rejected female emancipation for national elections by a margin of 2:1 of those (men) who voted.  Biography  Marceline Cordone was born in Lausanne. The family was not registered to pay Church tax. Rapha√´l Cordone, her father, was a secondary school teacher. When she had grown up she married an architect called Jean Mi√©ville, and is accordingly identified as Marceline Mi√©ville in contemporary sources concerning much of her political career. After the marriage ended in divorce, however, she reverted to her former name, Marceline Cordone. She trained as a dentist, receiving her degree in 1946. She was, by the standards of the time and place, a militant feminist. She was also politically active more widely, taking a particular interest in third world issues and abortion rights. She engaged actively in the \\"Swiss women's federation for peace and progress\\" (\\"F√©d√©ration des femmes suisses pour la paix et le progr√®s\\") and was a member of the Popular Workers' Party (\\"Parti ouvrier et populaire\\" / POP). In 1969 she joined the \\"Revolutionary Marxist League\\" (\\"Ligue marxiste r√©volutionnaire\\"). Marceline Cordone also took her politics to her professional life as a dentist. In a country where dentistry was and is widely perceived as an exceptionally lucrative profession, an affectionate obituary published after she died recalled that \\"people fallen on hard times knew where to find [dental] care that they would be able to pay for, perhaps, when their fortunes improved\\". By 1959 women had been entitled to vote in most of western Europe for more than a generation. Unusually for a Swiss domestic political issue, her candidacy for membership of the national parliament and its subsequent rejection on grounds of gender became a news story across and beyond Europe. She was interviewed at her home in Lausanne by an English television crew. The story found a mention in the New York Times and in Correio do Minho, a regional newspaper in Portugal. Photographs appeared showing her in her dental surgery with her infant daughter in her arms. Despite the pioneering role she was playing in respect of Swiss politics, commentators were keen to stress her normality and refute the evidently widespread notion that \\"for a lot of people a woman who does politics is probably not like other women\\". Women gained the right to vote in national elections only in 1971 and Marceline Mi√©ville never became a member of the National Council (Swiss national parliament). She was, however, elected to the Regional parliament (\\"Grand Council\\") of Vaud in 1962. She resigned her seat when she joined the \\"Revolutionary Marxist League\\" in 1969, thereby making the point, in the words of one sympathetic commentator, that there was \\"more than one way to do politics\\".

The Seven Men of Moidart, in Jacobite folklore, were seven followers of Charles Edward Stuart who accompanied him at the start of his 1745 attempt to reclaim the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland for the House of Stuart. The group included English, Scots and Irish subjects of varying backgrounds linked mostly by their involvement in pro- Stuart intrigues. Although some had military experience, most of the men were relatively elderly by the standards of the time; some were already infirm and little suited to the rigours of campaigning. The seven accompanied Charles on the French privateer Du Teillay, initially landing on Eriskay; the group later reached the mainland at Kinlochmoidart. In the early 19th century a row of beech trees was planted at Kinlochmoidart in commemoration of the events.The Seven Men of Moidart, Historic Environment Scotland List of the Men of Moidart =The Marquess of Tullibardine= William Murray, Marquess of Tullibardine (1689-1746), eldest surviving son of the 1st Duke of Atholl and brother of Jacobite Lieutenant-General Lord George Murray, had been heavily involved in the risings of 1715 (following which he was attainted for treason) and 1719. He spent the following years in exile in France, suffering from poor health and relative poverty, despite secret financial support from his family in Scotland. During the 1745 rising, as the senior representative of the house of Atholl, he was chosen to unfurl Charles's standard at Glenfinnan on 16 August though his military activity was limited by gout. He was captured following the defeat at Culloden and imprisoned in the Tower of London: in very poor health at the time of his arrival, he died shortly afterwards. =John William O'Sullivan= Sir John William O'Sullivan (1700-c.1760) was an Irish professional soldier who, like many Irish Jacobites, had served in the French army. Service in Corsica had given him experience of irregular warfare, and he was highly regarded and trusted by Charles. O'Sullivan was appointed the Jacobite army's Adjutant-General and Quartermaster-General and was an influential figure in the Jacobite \\"Council of War\\". After the rebellion's failure, Scottish Jacobites were quick to blame O'Sullivan for \\"tactical ineptitude\\",MacInnes, A. (1996) Clanship, commerce and the House of Stuart, 1603-1788, Tuckwell, p.202 a view repeated by 19th century historians and into modern times. More recent scholarship has challenged this view, concluding that this reputation was probably undeserved and that O'Sullivan was effective in the roles given to him.Reid, S. (2012) The Scottish Jacobite Army 1745‚Äì46, Bloomsbury, p.30 He later returned to service in the French army and wrote a detailed narrative account of the rebellion. =Sir Thomas Sheridan= Sir Thomas Sheridan (c.1684-1746) was an Anglo-Irish Jacobite courtier who had previously been involved in the 1715 rising. Sheridan was the son of a former Chief Secretary for Ireland; his mother, Helen Appleby, was rumoured to be an illegitimate daughter of James II.Geoghegan, V. Sheridan, Sir Thomas, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Having been appointed Charles Stuart's governor, he had a close and trusting relationship with him and was a member of the Jacobite Council during the rebellion. Following the Jacobite defeat at Culloden in April 1746, Sheridan escaped Scotland on the French privateer Mars: he had been in poor health for some time and died later that year at Rome. James Francis Edward Stuart, the Jacobite pretender. Despite the rebellion being undertaken in his name, he intensely disliked one of Charles's companions (Strickland), seriously mistrusted at least one other (Kelly), and was angry with a third (Sheridan) for permitting Charles to become involved. =Sir John MacDonald= Sir John MacDonald, or Macdonnell, (d. aft. 1760) a French subject of Irish origin, was a cavalryman and veteran of the French R√©giment de Fitz-James cavalerie. MacDonald, said to be a relative of the 5th Earl of Antrim and a distant kinsman of the Scottish Clan Donald, served as the Jacobite Inspector-General of Cavalry during the rebellion. He commanded the cavalry at Culloden, surrendered at Inverness, and was subsequently repatriated. MacDonald clashed on several occasions with Lord George Murray, whose memoir depicted him as \\"old and [...] much subject to his bottle\\",Thomson (ed) (1846) Memoirs of the Jacobites of 1715 and 1745, R. Bentley, p.134 and which claimed that Keppoch described him as \\"drunk or mad, if not both\\". As with O'Sullivan, Murray's depiction was a strong influence on 19th century accounts, which presented Charles's Irish-born advisors in a negative light. This view has also been reassessed, concluding that MacDonald was a competent officer. The experience of the 1745 rebellion seems to have influenced him to the degree he subsequently signed his name using the Scottish spelling \\"MacDonald\\".McDonnell, H. (1996) The Wild Geese of the Antrim MacDonnells, IAP, p.102 He also left a narrative account of the rebellion, which has been described as \\"disarmingly frank about his own limitations\\".McDonnell, H. (1996) The Wild Geese of the Antrim MacDonnells, IAP, p.102 Surviving correspondence from MacDonald shows that he was still alive in 1760. =Francis Strickland= Colonel Francis Strickland (1691-1746) was an English Roman Catholic from an old Westmorland family, the Stricklands of Sizergh Castle, who were longstanding Stuart loyalists. He had been involved in the 1715 rising and had some Continental military experience; MacDonald claimed to have served with him in Spain. Strickland later came to the Jacobite court at Rome: Charles's father James regarded him as a bad influence, partly as he had suggested Charles become an Anglican to secure political backing in England.Corp, E. (2011) The Stuarts in Italy, Cambridge UP, p.334 On finding he had accompanied the expedition to Scotland, James attempted to have Strickland dismissed. Strickland was taken ill on the march through Scotland and was left at Carlisle: following its retaking by the government he appears to have claimed to be a French subject,\\"List of those stiling themselves French officers, taken at Carlisle, 1745\\", The Gentlemans' Magazine, XVI, 24 but died there on 1 January 1746.Gooch, L. (1995) The Desperate Faction: the Jacobites of North-East England, 1688-1745, University of Hull Press, pp.168-9 James later wrote a letter to Charles describing the deaths of Strickland and Sheridan as \\"a manifest call from heaven for you to [...] rescue yourself from such hands\\". =George Kelly= The Rev. George Kelly (1688-1762) was an Irish nonjuring Protestant clergyman, born in County Roscommon. He attended Trinity College Dublin. In 1722 he was involved in the pro-Stuart Atterbury Plot; he was arrested, forfeited his estates, and was imprisoned in the Tower of London at the King's pleasure, before later escaping. In 1736 a memoir of his experiences was published by Edmund Curll.Fritz, P. (1975)The English Ministers and Jacobitism between the Rebellions of 1715 and 1745, University of Toronto Press He was said to be distrusted by JamesStevenson, W. (1968) The Jacobite Rising of 1745, Longmans, p.36 and to have had little understanding of the situation in England but was brought by Charles for his management of the rebels' propaganda efforts.G. H. \\"George Kelly\\" in The European Magazine, and London Review v40 (Nov. 1801), 329 He drafted the Manifesto issued by Charles early in the rebellion. Kelly, described by Charles's biographer McLynn as \\"one of the few truly evil men among the Jacobites\\",Zimmerman, D. (2003) The Jacobite Movement in Scotland and in Exile, 1746-1759, p.200 was sent back to France to report on the Jacobite victory at the Battle of Prestonpans and did not return to Scotland. To James's dismay he continued to serve as Charles's secretary. He was said to have died at Avignon in October 1762.G. H. \\"George Kelly\\" in The European Magazine, and London Review v40 (Nov. 1801), 329 =Aeneas MacDonald= Aeneas MacDonald (d.1770) was a Scottish banker who had spent his adult life in Paris. He was the son of a Clanranald tacksman, Ranald MacDonald of Kinlochmoidart; his younger brother, Donald MacDonald of Kinlochmoidart, also played a prominent role in the rebellion as Charles's ADC. Aeneas MacDonald was responsible for arranging much of Charles's initial funding, though later presented himself as a reluctant participant in the expedition who only accompanied them in order to exert influence on his brother. Captured by the government after Culloden, he was initially sentenced to death but was instead exiled. He wrote a memoir of the rebellion which was among those reproduced by Robert Forbes. MacDonald returned to France; a commonly cited, though erroneous, tradition states that he was killed during the French Revolution. Other conspirators Contrary to some relations of the folklore, it appears that a number of other people of lower social rank accompanied the conspirators. Some accounts cite the presence of Duncan Buchanan, a clerk for Aeneas MacDonald who acted as a Jacobite agent and messenger, instead of O'Sullivan.

The attack injured two soldiers from the Parachute Regiment, and destroyed a large part of the barracks. Background 1988 was when the IRA intensified their campaign outside of Northern Ireland. In May 1988 the IRA enjoyed one of their most successful ambushes on British Military figures in mainland Europe with the attacks in the Netherlands when they killed 3 and injured 3 RAF soldiers. Four months later in August 1988, the Provisional Irish Republican Army carried out the Inglis Barracks bombing, which killed one British soldier and injured 10 others. It was the first IRA attack in England since the Brighton hotel bombing in October 1984. The Attack On Monday 20 February 1989, the Provisional IRA exploded two bombs at Clive Barracks at Ternhill. Two IRA members were spotted while they were planting one of the three bombs they had and the alarm was raise by a sentry, Lance-Corporal Alan Norris. The two IRA members escaped with a stolen car they had hijacked just down the road, thanks to the sentry raising the alarm it gave about 50 British soldiers the chance to escape almost certain death but, only two soldiers were injured, one was hit by flying glass the other had only minor injuries. The two IRA bombers planted three bombs around the barracks. British police believe IRA fugitive Patrick Sheehy was the main operator in the attack. Only two of the bombs were primed and exploded, when the IRA members, both of whom were wearing combat jackets were approached by a soldier they threw the third bomb which was inside a backpack at him and ran to the car they had stolen and drove away. Soldiers fired three rounds at the IRA members who were fleeing but no shots hit their target. The bombs exploded about ten minutes after the IRA escaped. Even though nobody was killed in the attack the explosions caused large damage to the barracks. Aftermath The IRA claimed responsibility for the bombings and in a statement said: While Britain maintains its colonial grip on the north of Ireland, the IRA will continue to strike at those who oversee and implement British Government policy in our country, Clive Barracks bombing at Ternhill happened in February 1989. Then five months later in July 1989, the IRA killed a British soldier in Hanover, West Germany when they placed a booby-trap IED under his car. On the 7 September the IRA mistakenly shot dead Heidi Hazell, the German wife of a British soldier, in a hail of bullets in Dortmund. In the climax of the England and European campaign by the IRA closing in on the end of the 1980s was the Deal barracks bombing in which the IRA killed 11 Royal Marines and seriously injured 22 others; it was the highest death toll from an operation in England in seven years since Hyde Park and Regent's Park bombings of 1982, which again killed 11 soldiers and injured over 50.

The species was first described by Moore in 1859. It is found in Sri Lanka and India. It is a serious pest on coconut. The caterpillar feeds on leaf lamina until only the midribs remain. This results development of necrotic spots in early stage. In severe conditions, gumming on the nuts can be observed. Outbreaks were observed in Andhra Pradesh, India, in 2007, 2012 and 2013. Two larval parasitoids, Euplectrus and Euplectromorpha are effective for control agents. Eurytoma monemae is a pupal parasitoid. Paecilomyces lilacinus is an effective entomopathogen of the moth.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Mason was founded in 1838 by the investment company of Charles Noble from Monroe, Michigan. He established a sawmill/gristmill complex at the site and platted the first section of the village. The 1838 platting included what is now the courthouse square and thirty surrounding blocks, encompassing much of the current historic district. Settlers soon arrived, and the square became the central focus of commercial development. A road to Lansing was started in 1839, and in 1840 Mason became the county seat, attracting more development. The first courthouse was built in 1858. Additional sections were platted in 1866, and Mason was incorporated as a city in 1875. A population boom occurred in the 1880s, with the population reaching 2200 people in 1887. The area around the courthouse square became solidly commercial. Development slowed in the early 1900s, so that older housing stock constructed near downtown was preserved from further expansion; some of these residential structures still stand in the district. The current Ingham County Courthouse was constructed in 1903-05. Description The Courthouse Square Historic District is an eleven-block area containing the commercial heart of Mason. It includes the Ingham County Courthouse and surrounding commercial, civic, and religious buildings, as well as two historic residential neighborhoods bracketing the downtown. In addition to the courthouse, important civic buildings include the library and the post office, as well as a school and three churches. There are a total of 181 structures in the district, of which 164 contribute to the historic quality of the district. The residential neighborhoods are similar in nature, both having tree-lined streets, moderate set-backs, and a mixture of architectural styles, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Gothic Revival, Queen Anne, and Craftsman. The houses have similar construction materials, such as metal roofs, simple wooden door and window surrounds, and clapboard-sheathed wood framing. Despite the differences in architectural styles, the scale of the houses make a consistent streetscape.

The 2014 book The Coal River Valley in the Civil War: West Virginia Mountains identified the Coal Valley News as the \\"region's principal local newspaper.\\" The newspaper's title has been described in national media as typical of Boone County, where the coal industry plays defining role in the local economy. It is considered a newspaper of public record by the West Virginia Secretary of State.  History  Founded in 1925 by M.L. Jones, it achieved notoriety in 1931 when a local sheriff allegedly paid to have the plant damaged in an attempt to shut down production of the paper. Amos Sullivan testified that on the morning of October 23, 1930, he had attended a deputies' meeting that had discussed recent opposition of the Guyan Valley News to Republican candidates favored by the sheriff's department. At that time the Guyan Valley News, which had been running editorials attacking the \\"Hatfield clique\\", was printed in the Coal Valley News plant. Sullivan testified that at the meeting it was said that \\"something had to be done\\" and claimed he had later been paid five hundred dollars by Logan County Sheriff Tennis Hatfield to damage the plant. He broke into the newspaper printing plant late at night, but was surprised by assistant editor Elmer Jones, who shot and seriously wounded him. Both deputy Henry Napier and Amos Sullivan pled guilty to the crime, with Sullivan receiving a year in prison. In 1935, the paper was a prominent critic of the appointment of William N. Beehler as West Virginia relief administrator for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, arguing that his nonpartisan approach to government aid programs was disqualifying. The paper was acquired by HD Media from Civitas Media in June 2017. The paper is archived by the West Virginia Division of Culture and History.

It was the 48th edition of the Fiesta Bowl, and was one of the 2018‚Äì19 bowl games concluding the 2018 FBS football season. Sponsored by Sony Interactive Entertainment via its PlayStation brand, the game was officially known as the PlayStation Fiesta Bowl. The LSU Tigers defeated the UCF Knights by the score of 40‚Äì32, snapping UCF's 25-game winning streak, the longest in the nation at the time. The Tigers dominated time of possession (44:31) and racked up 555 yards of offense. The Knights offense was held to a season-low 250 total yards, but scored a Fiesta Bowl record 93-yard interception return for a touchdown. Despite the loss, the Knights extended their NCAA Division I FBS record with their 26th consecutive game scoring 30 or more points, and the FBS-leading 32nd consecutive game forcing a turnover. It was LSU's 26th bowl victory, and first Fiesta Bowl victory. In a game that was described as \\"chippy\\", three players were ejected in the first half alone, two for LSU and one for UCF. Tigers defensive back Terrence Alexander was ejected for throwing a punch, while safety Grant Delpit was ejected for targeting. Knights defender Kyle Gibson was ejected for targeting, while linebacker Nate Evans and defensive lineman Randy Charlton each committed costly unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. With the two participating schools both from the southeast, the announced attendance for the game was 57,246, the lowest since 1979. Teams The game featured LSU of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and UCF of the American Athletic Conference (The American). This was the first meeting between the two programs. =LSU Tigers= LSU accepted a bid to the Fiesta Bowl on December 2. The Tigers entered the bowl with a 9‚Äì3 record (5‚Äì3 in conference). It would be their first appearance in the Fiesta Bowl, and mark their nineteenth consecutive season playing in a postseason bowl game. LSU entered the game depleted, however, as a number of players would sit out due to various reasons. They were also coming off an exhausting 7-OT loss against Texas A&M.; Cornerback Greedy Williams and nose tackle Ed Alexander elected to skip the game to prepare for the NFL Draft. Kristian Fulton and Breiden Fehoko both were out due to injuries, while Jacob Phillips was required to sit out the first half due a targeting penalty in their previous game. Three additional players did not make the trip, Kelvin Joseph and Dare Rosenthal, suspended for violating team rules, and Travez Moore for \\"personal issues.\\" Despite being involved in a fatal shooting days earlier, Clyde Edwards-Helaire and Jared Small were available to play, as was Kary Vincent, mourning the recent loss of a family member. =UCF Knights= UCF defeated Memphis in the AAC Championship Game on December 1, then accepted a bid to the Fiesta Bowl on December 2. The Knights entered the bowl with a 12‚Äì0 record (8‚Äì0 in conference), riding an overall 25-game winning streak dating back to the start of the 2017 season. It would be the second appearance by the Knights in the Fiesta Bowl, as they defeated Baylor 52‚Äì42 in the 2014 edition. The biggest story entering the game was the loss of starting quarterback McKenzie Milton. During the second quarter against rival South Florida, Milton suffered a devastating leg injury, sidelining him for rest of the season and the entire 2019 season. Freshman Darriel Mack Jr. took over at quarterback, and led the team to victory in that game, and to a comeback victory against Memphis in the conference championship game. The Fiesta Bowl would be only Mack's third career start. Game summary =First quarter= LSU won the coin toss and elected to receive. Clyde Edwards-Helaire took the opening kickoff back 77 yards all the way to the UCF 16 yard line. The Knights defense, however, stiffened, and kept the Tigers out of the endzone. Cole Tracy kicked a 24-yard field goal for the first points of the game. On their first drive, Darriel Mack Jr. led the Knights on a 6-play, 69-yard drive. A 25-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae put the Knights up 7‚Äì3. LSU drove to the Knights 15 yard line, but quarterback Joe Burrow was intercepted by Brandon Moore at the 7 yard line. Moore ran the ball back 93 yards for the touchdown (a Fiesta Bowl record), and a 14‚Äì3 Knights lead. During the return, defensive lineman Joey Connors made a legal blindside block on Burrow, sending him to the ground, but he was able to recover. Nate Evans drew a penalty, however, for taunting Burrow after the play, and it was assessed on the kickoff. On the next drive, LSU faced a 3rd down & 12 at the UCF 41 yard line. Kyle Gibson sacked Burrow for a 6-yard loss. Randy Charlton was able to wrestle the ball away from Burrow, but not before Burrow was whistled down. Charlton was subsequently flagged for an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty after spiking the ball. The penalty proved costly as it gave LSU new life, and was a turning point in the game. The Tigers were awarded 15 yards and a first down. Six plays later they were in the endzone for their first touchdown. Driving across midfield in the closing seconds of the first quarter, quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. was tackled on a run, and fumbled the ball, and LSU recovered. =Second quarter= LSU scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second quarter, erasing the deficit, and pulling out to a 24‚Äì14 lead. Meanwhile, the Knights went three-and-out twice, and also turned the ball over on downs in Tigers territory. With under two minutes left before halftime, LSU pinned UCF back at their own 5 yard line. Mack led the Knights on a 10-play, 95-yard drive, capped off by a much-needed score. Facing a 3rd down & 14 at the LSU 32 yard line, Mack threw a touchdown pass to Gabriel Davis at the back of the endzone with 4 seconds left. At halftime, LSU led 24‚Äì21. =Third quarter= UCF got the ball to start the second half, but went three-and-out on their first three drives. LSU scored a 32-yard touchdown from Joe Burrow to Ja'Marr Chase, and also kicked a field goal to go up 34‚Äì21. With 3:56 left in the third quarter, Mack Loudermilk's punt was muffed by Tigers return man Justin Jefferson, and UCF recovered at the 20 yard line. The Knights had to settle for a field goal, however, and kicker Matthew Wright trimmed the score to 34‚Äì24. =Fourth quarter= LSU tacked on two more field goals in the fourth quarter, and stretched their lead to 40‚Äì24. With just over four minutes remaining in regulation, the Knights went on a swift 75-yard scoring drive. A 2-yard touchdown run by Taj McGowan, followed by a two-point conversion, made the score 40‚Äì32 with 2:24 remaining. The Knights attempted an onside kick, but failed to recover. The Knights defense forced a three-and-out, and got one last possession with 35 seconds to go. With 20 seconds left, Mack's pass attempt deflected off of players, and was intercepted by JaCoby Stevens to seal the win for LSU, ending UCF's bid to go undefeated in consecutive seasons.

It is also known as Long Point. The property is owned by Department of the Environment and Shellharbour City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 January 2013.  History  =Indigenous history= Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people occupied the Illawarra region for some 20,000 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. The Elouera people are traditional custodians of the land extending from Stanwell Park in the north, Shoalhaven River in the south, west to Picton and Moss Vale, and east to the ocean. The Elouera people are a group, subdivided from the larger Dharawal group, that occupies the land from Botany Bay to Jervis Bay. In the Illawarra region, the Elouera were identified as fresh or salt water people due to their occupation of particular marine or estuarine landscapes and their use of the natural resources found in these environments. Essentially, the Elouera people lived a hunter/gatherer lifestyle, governed by the sustainable use of their surrounding environment and the available resources. Traditionally, the division of labour in such a society was determined by gender and age - men hunted by land and sea while women gathered food and resources. The Aboriginal people had developed their understanding of the region and environmental sustainability over thousands of years and there is archaeological evidence to suggest that the people travelled the land making use of seasonal resources when they were abundantly available and allowing those depleted to regenerate with time. The diet of the Elouera people was varied and flexible - consisting of (among other things) fish, shellfish and seals from the ocean; and wallabies, possums, birds and plants from the land. Evidence of this changing diet has been found through archaeological investigation of the shell middens at both Bass Point and along the NSW coastline. These shell middens are found in coastal environments throughout Australia - but particularly on the east coast. Those identified at Bass Point have been dated at 6000 years old, from the period when the sea levels stabilised and the coastal environment developed into what it is today. Analysis of the content of these middens has revealed shell and food remains that indicate the hunter/gatherer lifestyle of the traditional Aboriginal people in the Illawarra region. Excavation of shell middens at Bass Point have also revealed the changing tools and technology used by the Elouera people to exploit the available resources around them - in particular, the development and evolution of hunting practices as species of fish and animals changed with the seasons and over the years. Middens are usually found in close proximity to both fresh water supplies and have often resulted from an established occupation of a place. Evidence at Bass Point indicates the longevity of its use by the Aboriginal people as an important camping and meeting place - a value supported by the oral tradition of the local people. The coastal plain is known to have been an abundant natural environment of food and fresh water resources and, with their in-depth understanding of the marine environment, Bass Point must have been regarded by the Aboriginal people as a resourceful place that could sustain long-term occupation. =Early European history= A harmonious and balanced relationship between the Aboriginal people and the environment existed for thousands of years and it was in this form when the Aboriginal people first had contact with European explorers. Although there may have been earlier contact with Portuguese, Spanish, Polynesian or Asian explorers, the first report of Bass Point and the local Aboriginal people comes from Captain James Cook who sailed by the region on the Endeavour in April 1770. Those on board noted in their journals of their observations - \\"Sunday, 22nd April:....and were so near the shore as to distinguish several people upon the Sea Beach. They appeared to be of a very dark Colour....Thursday, 26th April: Saw several smokes along shore after dark, and 2 or 3 times a fire\\".Organ, \\"A Documentary History of the Illawarra and South Coast Aborigines\\", p. 2 The journals from the Endeavour also make note of the \\"numerous campfires, on the blackness of the natives, and of a luxuriant vegetation and varied landscape\\".Organ & Speechley, \\"Illawarra Aborigines\\", p.8 There are historical reports that Cook attempted to make a landing along the Illawarra coastline but abandoned these efforts due to uncertain and dangerous conditions. Had this landing been successful, it would have been the first on Australian soil - predating that at Botany Bay. Although the lives of the Aboriginal people continued relatively undisturbed following this visit, stories soon circulated between the groups about sightings of the \\"White Swan\\" (believed to be a reference to the sails of the Endeavour). The geographic nature of the Illawarra ensured that the region remained isolated from the early colonial settlement following the First Fleet landing in 1788. The surrounding mountains provided a barrier to the north and west and, with the absence of a natural and accessible harbour, official settlement of the region did not occur until early in the nineteenth century. Stories of the arrival of Europeans surely spread to the region through communication between Aboriginal groups quickly and, as in other parts of Australia, it was first thought by the Aboriginal people that the settlers were their reborn ancestors. Their pale skin but similar features ensured inquisitive but mostly civil early interactions between the settlers and the Elouera people. =Early Colonial exploration of the Illawarra region= The first official exploration of the Illawarra region (then known as the 'Five Islands District') was recorded by George Bass and Matthew Flinders in 1796. Following a similar exploratory expedition up the Georges River, Bass and Flinders ventured to the Illawarra region to explore and examine the country, take specimens from the environment and to report their findings back to the colony with recommendations for possible future settlements. The local Aboriginal people may have had sporadic interactions with other Europeans after the Bass/Flinders visit (including the shipwreck survivors of the Sydney Cove in 1797 who were making the arduous and largely fatal trek from Cape Howe to Sydney) but little changed as a result of the First Fleet landing until the region was officially settled in 1803 - the effect of this settlement on the local Aboriginal people being felt almost immediately. The colonial settlement in Sydney experienced a severe drought in 1803 that threatened the agricultural industries (particularly cattle grazing) that supported life in the colony. Finding fresh new pastures was essential to the survival of the industry and reports of the rich untouched land further south at Lake Illawarra soon circulated amongst the colonists. Free grazing rights were issued by the government - and a significant land parcel stretching from Lake Illawarra to the Minnamurra River (and incorporating Bass Point) was granted to free settler, James Badgery, for cattle running. At this time, Red Cedar-cutting was also an important industry in the colony and there were lucrative supplies discovered in the virgin bush of the Illawarra region. Both the cattlemen and the cedar-cutters were adventurous and were the first Europeans to traverse the unknown country - successfully doing so by following the traditional trails established by the Aboriginal people. From even this early period of settlement, European exploitation of the land and resources had begun. The easy abuse of land through clearing of vegetation and wildlife would have been an abhorrent disrespect to the Aboriginal people. The traditional lifestyle of the people had been sustained by this land and its immediate exploitation by the European settlers would no doubt have led to future conflicts. =Colonial settlement and development of industry= In 1816, in an effort to regulate land ownership in an official system, Governor Lachlan Macquarie called for the division of the region (what is now Shellharbour Municipality) into land grants - 22 in total. The free grants were given to prominent colonial citizens and cattlemen - one such grant of 1650 acres, and later an additional 2000 acres (including Bass Point), was granted to D'Arcy Wentworth, a wealthy colonial official and medical practitioner. Although Wentworth was promised the land grants in 1817, he was not issued with the land until 1821 when he established \\"Peterborough Estate\\". Following the exit of Badgery, Wentworth was able to run his own cattle while, at the same time, acquiring surrounding grants to expand his land holding. There is a strong presumption that the expansion of Peterborough Estate was organised with the other land-holders from very early on. The land was rich in pasture and possibility but remained largely unsettled and unused by its early owners. By 1827, Wentworth had acquired the largest land holding in the region totalling 13,050 acres - including Bass Point and the private Peterborough township (that is now Shellharbour village). The repossession and division of the richest lands in the region had a devastating effect on the Elouera people. The prime locations selected for land grants would have been those with easy accessibility to fresh water supplies - the areas most valued by the Aboriginal people for resources and as traditional camping places. Larger numbers of people occupying the land also reduced the capacity for the Aboriginal people to traverse the region as they had traditionally done. Colonial grazing and farming of the land also had a detrimental and lasting effect on the native food supplies used by the Aboriginal people. Traditional plants had been destroyed by grazing cattle and replaced by introduced plant species. Additionally, native animal species had been frightened away from their habitats. In no time, the scarcity of traditional resources saw a crisis arise in the lifestyle of the local Aboriginal people - their homeland was being ravaged and their very survival was at risk. The rapid degradation of the sustainable environment left the traditional Aboriginal people with one option: appropriate the introduced crops and stock to survive. While traditional Aboriginal life had no concept of ownership (but rather a shared use of land and resources), the settlers viewed their actions as theft and crimes punishable by violent retaliation. At this point in relations, the Aboriginal people were struggling to maintain their traditional ways of life while contending with the force of the colonial settlers and it was soon realised that the Elouera people had little to match the sheer number of settlers with their introduced firearms and diseases (smallpox, influenza and tuberculosis). The colonial government, under Governor Macquarie's direction, had declared unofficial war against the Aboriginal people. A detachment of the 46th Regiment was sent to Red Point (now Hill 60 at Port Kembla) to bring a show of force to the Aboriginal people. \\"During April of 1816 Macquarie instructed his soldiers to seek out the Aborigines and \\"strike them with terror .... drive them to a distance from the settlements of the White Men ... inflict terrible and exemplary punishments\\" so as the NSW Government would not be seen to show cowardice in the face of perceived Aboriginal aggression\\".Organ & Speechley, \\"Illawarra Aborigines\\", p.10 It was the colonial intention that fear be instilled in the local Aboriginal people to reduce retaliation attempts on the settlement. As a result of this action, the traditional Aboriginal population was quickly decimated. With forced removal to fringe camps, assimilation to European culture and the imposition of strict control measures - coupled with their delegation to the bottom of the social hierarchy - the Aboriginal people had no recourse against the invasion of the settlers throughout the nineteenth century. Governor Macquarie's plans to expand the colonial frontier had been a success and the rich land of the Illawarra region had been cleared of its traditional inhabitants and was free to be exploited by the settlers. By the 1840s, the colony was experiencing an economic depression and the large landholdings in the region were soon subdivided into smaller tenant farms. Provided rent-free for periods of up to six years, the land was leased to families for the purpose of clearing native vegetation and cultivating crops. Wheat and maize were popular early crops but soon proved to be susceptible to rust and ultimately financially unprofitable for the farmers. By the second half of the nineteenth century however, the dairy industry had been established and was proving to be a successful business for the small landholders in the region. During this period, of Peterborough Estate (including Bass Point) had been sold by the Wentworth family to George Laurence Fuller who named the property \\"Dunmore Estate\\". By 1880, Fuller had negotiated a mining venture and established a basalt \\"blue gold\\" quarry to the south of Bass Point including the construction of a new jetty to ship the quarried metal. Although the enterprise collapsed within two years, Fuller resumed operations as the proprietor and manager and, by 1890, business was booming. To support the industry, Fuller soon improved and extended the jetty to and commissioned the construction of the SS Dunmore to transport the crushed basalt from Bass Point to the markets of Sydney. =Shipping trade at Bass Point= Shipping was the favoured mode of transport of the product but the journey was often a hazardous one with a number of ships lost along the coast and in the waters surrounding Bass Point. The Bertha, an wooden schooner, is thought to be one of the earliest wrecks from the basalt trade. It was reported that she was transporting bluestone from Kiama to Sydney and, on 9 September 1879, ran ashore on the north side of Bass Point and broke apart. It was reported in the media at the time that the local Aboriginal people camped at Bass Point had assisted with the rescue of the three crewmen and two passengers on board by conveying a line from the stricken vessel to the shore. Over the years, other ships experienced a similar fate to that of the Bertha: in 1880, the wooden paddle steamer Our Own was wrecked off the beach at Bass Point with the loss of two lives; the Alexander Berry, a wooden steamer, went down in 1901 with four of the five crewmen perishing in the accident; the Comboyne wrecked in 1920; and the Kiltobranks, another blue metal carrier, in 1924. One of the more well-known shipwrecks of Bass Point was the loss of the Cities Service Boston on 16 May 1943. The US oil tanker was transporting fuel supplies from the Middle East before running aground during a storm at what is now known as Boston Point. Australian soldiers from the 6th Australian Machine Gun Battalion were camped nearby and assisted in the rescue of the 62 crew on board. All lives from the Boston were saved but four Australian soldiers perished in the rescue. To commemorate the loss, plaques were unveiled at Bass Point in 1968 and a remembrance service is held at the site each year. Since Dunmore Estate was sold in the 1920s, the land in and around Bass Point was used by the Australian Military Forces for defensive, training and surveillance functions. By , Bass Point was purchased by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) and mining of its extensive basalt deposits was renewed. The original jetty had deteriorated beyond the needs of the mining leases and was ultimately demolished in 1958 before being replaced by a new jetty directly east of the original. =Conservation as a nature reserve= It was as a result of the increased mining of Bass Point in the 1960s, that its future as a natural reserve was first considered. Local conservationists had formed a society to promote the natural value of Bass Point and to balance the interests of both conservation and development. A reserve was officially declared in 1968 and, furthermore, Bushrangers Bay Marine Reserve was declared in 1982. =Archaeological discoveries= Since the historic value of Bass Point has been recognised, there have been archaeological investigations of the area that have revealed significant information about its pre-contact history. Of the 12 shell midden sites identified on Bass Point, Dr Sandra Bowdler investigated six sites in 1970 as the basis for her thesis. Further analysis of the remaining six sites was undertaken by Dr PJ Hughes in 1974. Middens of the NSW South Coast, including those at Bass Point, contain indicative remains of the food sources of the Aboriginal people. Upon analysis of the middens at Bass Point, Dr Bowdler and Dr Hughes discovered shells and bones of shellfish, fish, wallabies, bandicoots, possums, birds and seals. It was also considered that the many middens along the northern shoreline may, in fact, represent a single continuous midden site. These archaeological excavations revealed the environmental change and evolution of Bass Point over time and, further analysis of the midden sites has shown the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources. As a result of these archaeological assessments, Bass Point is now considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW.  Description  Idiotropiscis lumnitzeri), approx in length at Bass Point, 2013 Located south of Wollongong, Bass Point Reserve is a 4 km-long natural promontory of rocky shorelines and sandy embayments that supports a diverse collection of natural and cultural elements. As a cultural landscape, Bass Point Reserve includes sites of Aboriginal archaeological significance and others of European historical significance. Fourteen sites associated with the sustained Aboriginal occupation of the land have been identified - 13 of which are coastal shell middens and one meeting and camping place. Sites of European occupation include potential remnants of the original jetty (to the west of the existing jetty) and, on Boston Point, a memorial to the 1943 shipwreck of the Cities Service Boston and the four lives lost during the rescue operation. In the waters surrounding Bass Point Reserve, six shipwrecks have been identified and the associated artefact scatter recorded. These wrecks include Bertha (1879), Our Own (1880), Alexander Berry (1901), Comboyne (1920), Kiltobranks (1924) and the Cities Service Boston (1943). The Bass Point Marine Area surrounding the reserve is regarded as highly significant for its biodiversity and pristine condition. This relatively undisturbed environment supports a variety of common, rare and endangered fauna and flora species. The shallow and sheltered waters have seen the development of a significant but fragile Sea Grass Habitat that provides a suitable environment for many aquatic animals to shelter, feed and breed. Bass Point Marine Area is also classified as critical habitat for the Grey Nurse Shark - an endangered species under NSW law. To the eastern point of Bass Point Reserve is Bushrangers Bay Aquatic Reserve. Made up of beaches, intertidal rock pools, seagrasses and submarine cliffs the reserve provides important habitats for a variety of animals including fish, anemones, sponges, crabs, molluscs and urchins. Bass Point Reserve also supports diverse headland vegetation and significant littoral rainforest - making it one of the most important and unique natural landscapes in southern NSW. Littoral rainforest is generally a closed forest with its structure and composition strongly influenced by its close proximity to the marine environment. Positioned on coastal headlands or beach sand dunes, littoral rainforest is considered an Endangered Ecological Community in NSW. The natural vegetation of Bass Point Reserve supports a variety of flora and fauna, both common and rare to the region. Today, the spectacular visual interplay of the bush vegetation, beaches, headlands, cliffs, ocean and sky makes Bass Point Reserve a scenic location for recreation visitors. = Condition = The natural environment of Bass Point Reserve has undergone periods of regeneration by Shellharbour Council's rangers and is in good condition. The ongoing maintenance of visitor areas has also ensured the good condition of facilities. Since the Bass Point Marine Area was identified, and specific areas classified as critical habitats and aquatic reserves, the marine environment surrounding Bass Point Reserve has remained in pristine condition. Although Bass Point Reserve has been subject to earlier archaeological investigations (in 1969/70 by Dr Sandra Bowdler and again in 1974 by Hughes & Sullivan), there is great potential for further archaeological discoveries - both terrestrial and maritime. Through Dr Bowdler's investigation, she concluded that there is potential that the individual shell midden sites on the northern shoreline could represent one single continuous midden site. It is also highly probable that there may be unrecorded Aboriginal artefact scatters and burial sites on the reserve (either individually or in association with midden sites). In regard to shipwrecks, the location of the Bertha remains undiscovered and it is also possible that there are further shipwrecks that have gone unrecorded in present documentation. Bass Point Reserve is an evolving and naturally changing landscape but its designation as a nature reserve has ensured that the site will remain a natural environment into the future while maintaining its use for recreational purposes. = Modifications and dates = Since pre- European contact, with archaeological evidence indicating sustained occupation of Bass Point by Aboriginal people (some 20,000 years), the following modifications have been made: *1803 - grazing and clearing rights secured by free settler, James Badgery, for land (including Bass Point) *1880 - George Laurence Fuller (proprietor and business manager) commences basalt mining on Bass Point *1885 - Fuller builds jetty for shipping of blue metal from Bass Point quarry to Sydney * - Fuller improves and extends jetty to *1939-53 - Bass Point used by Australian Military Forces for various defensive, training and surveillance functions * - demolition of jetty and construction of modern replacement (sited directly to the east) *1968 - construction and unveiling of memorial to Cities Service Boston shipwreck and the four lives lost during the rescue operation *1968 - Bass Point given to Shellharbour Council for future use as natural reserve *Post-1968 - minor development (building and maintaining roads; parking sites; amenities; and public facilities)  Heritage listing  As at 28 March 2012, Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for both its Aboriginal and European values; its pre- and post-contact history; and its natural and maritime heritage. Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people have occupied the Illawarra region and Bass Point Reserve for some 20,000 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. The traditional custodians of the land, the Elouera people lived in a hunter/gatherer lifestyle, governed by the sustainable use of the environment and the resources available. Bass Point was a place of established occupation for the Aboriginal people and is regarded as a traditionally important camping and meeting place. Bass Point has been the focus of attention from archaeologists since the late 1960s as an area that has potential to reveal significant information about pre-contact history in NSW. Twelve midden sites and one camping/meeting place have been identified and archaeological excavations have revealed the environmental change and evolution of the area over time and the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources. Alongside Burrill Lake rock shelter (which is of similar antiquity), Bass Point is considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW. It is considered to be a rare example of established occupation and continues to be of exceptionally high significance to the Aboriginal people of NSW. Upon the arrival of European settlers to the Illawarra region in 1803, the land of Bass Point was granted to D'Arcy Wentworth, a wealthy colonial official and the Principal Surgeon and Principal Superintendent of Police. A significant colonial figure, Wentworth developed a substantial estate (of some - including Bass Point) from 1821-1865 and was influential in the development of the Shellharbour area. Bass Point also had a significant but brief association with Captain James Cook who first made note of the region and its Aboriginal occupants as the Endeavour sailed by the coastline in April 1770. Bass Point has another brief association with the colonial explorers George Bass and Matthew Flinders who made the first recorded European visit to the region in 1796. The contemporary naming of Bass Point commemorates these early explorations. Bass Point Reserve has significant natural features and habitats that contribute to its aesthetic value. A prominent headland in the region, Bass Point contains elements of bush, beach and ocean that create a visually spectacular environment of both land and sea. This key coastal landscape is also regarded as highly significant for its biodiversity and pristine condition. The relatively undisturbed environment supports a variety of common, rare and endangered fauna and flora species - including littoral rainforest and habitats for the endangered grey nurse shark and sea grasses. The maritime landscape around Bass Point Reserve also contains a number of shipwrecks and archaeological evidence, dating from 1879. The most significant and well known, the Cities Service Boston, was wrecked in May 1943 and a memorial was erected at Boston Point to commemorate the Australian lives lost in the rescue. Bass Point Reserve was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 18 January 2013 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for both its Aboriginal and European values and its pre- and post-contact history. Archaeological evidence indicates that Aboriginal people occupied Bass Point Reserve for some 20,000 years prior to the arrival of European settlers. The traditional custodians of the land, these people lived in a hunter/gatherer lifestyle, governed by the sustainable use of the environment and the resources available. Bass Point has been the focus of attention from archaeologists since the late 1960s as an area that has potential to reveal significant information about pre-contact history in NSW. Twelve midden sites and one camping/meeting place have been identified and archaeological excavations have revealed the environmental change and evolution of the area over time and the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources. Alongside Burrill Lake rock shelter (which is of similar antiquity), Bass Point is considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW. Official European settlement in the Illawarra region and on Bass Point Reserve, started from 1817 with the division of land and the establishment of agriculture and industry. The development of basalt mining on the point saw the growth of shipping in the region but, due to the hazardous conditions of the new transport route, a number of ships were wrecked off the Bass Point coastline - the Bertha (1879); Our Own (1880); Alexander Berry (1901); Comboyne (1920); Kiltobranks (1924); and the Cities Service Boston (1943). The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Bass Point Reserve is of state heritage significance for its association with a number of significant people and groups. Traditionally, and for some 20,000 years prior to European settlement, the land has been occupied by the Elouera people of the Dharawal group. The longevity of the use of Bass Point as a camping and meeting place indicates its significance to the Aboriginal people of this region. Documentary, archaeological and oral evidence indicate that Bass Point was, and is, considered to be an extremely important place by local Aboriginal people and that \\"the general \\"feeling\\" about the place was that it was a good and happy place\\".'Bass Point Reserve: Draft Plan of Management (Volume 1: Reference Document)', 2000, p43. Although the significance of this site to the Elouera people stretches for thousands of years into the past, its importance to the contemporary Aboriginal community continues today. Bass Point also had a significant, but brief, association with Captain James Cook and the Endeavour. As the Endeavour sailed by the Illawarra coastline in April 1770, journal notes were made about their observations of the landscape and the traditional Aboriginal occupants. There is evidence to suggest that Cook attempted a landing in the region but abandoned the effort due to dangerous conditions. Had this landing attempt succeeded, it would have been the first on Australian soil - predating that at Botany Bay. The first recorded European visit to the region was by colonial explorers and naval men, George Bass and Matthew Flinders, in 1796. Exploring the unknown country to observe and report back to the colony, Bass and Flinders were most-likely the first contact the Elouera people had had with European settlers. The contemporary naming of Bass Point commemorates the initial explorations of these significant explorers. After the Illawarra region had been officially settled, the land was divided into free grants, and Bass Point was granted to D'Arcy Wentworth, a wealthy colonial official and medical practitioner. Wentworth had arrived in Australia as a free settler and Assistant Surgeon on a convict fleet in 1790. By 1811, Governor Lachlan Macquarie had appointed him Principal Surgeon and Principal Superintendent of Police. Also a founding member of the Bank of NSW, Wentworth is a significant colonial figure who developed a substantial estate (of some 13,050 acres, including Bass Point) from 1821-1865. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Bass Point Reserve has significant natural features and habitats that contribute to its aesthetic value. A prominent headland in the region, Bass Point contains important elements of bush, beach and ocean that create a visually spectacular environment of both land and sea. This key coastal landscape has significant aesthetic value and its general visitation numbers reflects the public's ongoing admiration for the natural beauty of this site. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The social significance of Bass Point Reserve remains strong in contemporary Aboriginal culture. There is a widespread understanding that the Elouera people (a subdivision of the larger Dharawal group) are the traditional occupants of the land of the Illawarra region. The coastal landscape at Bass Point supported the established camp sites of the Aboriginal people and provided a diverse and sustainable natural source of food and fresh water for some 20,000 years prior to European arrival to Australia. Following white settlement, the Aboriginal people continued to use the Bass Point area as a camp site and meeting place. The designation of Bass Point Reserve has ensured that the natural value of the site is conserved and is still available for use by the Aboriginal people of the region today. The site is also widely used by visitors as a tourist and recreational resource. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Bass Point Reserve has state heritage significance for its potential to reveal further information through archaeological research. Although it has been subject to earlier archaeological investigations (in 1969/70 by Dr Sandra Bowdler and again in 1974 by Hughes & Sullivan), there is great potential for further archaeological discoveries, both terrestrial and maritime. Through Dr Bowdler's investigation, it was concluded that there is potential that the individual shell midden sites on the northern shoreline could represent one single and continuous midden. It is also highly probable that there may be unrecorded Aboriginal artefact scatters and burial sites on the reserve (either individually or in association with midden sites). In regard to shipwrecks, the location of the Bertha remains undiscovered and it is also possible that there are further shipwrecks that have gone unrecorded in present documentation. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Bass Point has been the focus of attention from archaeologists since the late 1960s as an area that has potential to reveal significant information about pre-contact history in NSW. Twelve midden sites and one camping/meeting place have been identified at Bass Point and archaeological excavations have revealed the environmental change and evolution of the area over time and the development of techniques used by the Aboriginal people to hunt and gather available resources. Alongside Burrill Lake rock shelter (which is of similar antiquity), Bass Point is considered to be one of the most significant Aboriginal archaeological sites to be excavated in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Bass Point is representative of prominent headlands in the Illawarra region and contains the coastal vegetation found throughout the area. Bass Point is also representative of places that had established occupation by Aboriginal people due to the plentiful and sustained food resources occurring naturally in the environment.

Harvey was most notable for developing the training of neonatal medicine doctors at a time when the speciality had no official recognition. Harvey was homosexual and never afraid to disclose it, even at the beginning of his career, when homophobia was more prominent. Life Harvey was the son of Cyril Francis Harvey, a diamond merchant. His early education was completed in Dulwich College and his clinical training at the University of London and Guy's Hospital Medical School qualifying in 1960. Harvey suffered from Parkinson's disease in later life and in 1998 had to leave Hammersmith Hospital and Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospitals due to the effects of the disease. Harvey was promoted to emeritus professor of paediatrics and neonatal medicine at Imperial College London. In 2004 his long time partner Teck Ong died. After becoming increasingly debilitated and immobile, he was cared for by his cousin, Anthony Stranger-Jones. Career Harvey was then employed in several junior positions at Guy's Hospital, before becoming a registrar at Hammersmith Hospital. From 1963 to 1970 he worked at Guys Hospital as a senior registrar specialising in paediatrics. While at Guy's Hospital, Harvey underwent training with some of the most prestigious paediatricians including Pamela Davies, Peter Tizard, Otto Wolff, John Davis and Geoffrey Dawes. In 1970, Harvey was appointed to a consultant paediatrician post at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital and St Charles‚Äô Hospital a year later, a position he held until 2002. Contributions Harvey was appointed to the founding advisory committee of the premature baby medical care charity, Bliss in 1979. He was principally notable for advocating research that was then considered unimportant, compared to the core research used to treat brain and life support functions. One of these treatments which made him well known was the storage and provisioning of donor breast milk for use by premature babies, an issue that is still relevant and unsolved today. The discovery and effects of HIV led to the inevitable closure of many breast milk banks around the UK and it was only thanks to the support of Harvey that the human milk storage bank at Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea hospital survived. Royal confinements Harvey was the court appointed consultant paediatrician for the birth of Princess Anne's children, Peter Phillips in 1977 and Zara Phillips in 1981. Harvey was further appointed as consultant paediatrician for the births of Diana, Princess of Wales's children, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge in 1982 and Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex in 1984. Memberships and associations Harvey was active in establishing the Gay and Lesbian Association of Doctors and Dentists (GLADD), becoming a founder member, later became treasurer and co-chair. Harvey also had a position as director of the charity, the Terence Higgins Trust. Bibliography * Neonatal Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics., G Rylance; David R Harvey; Jacob V Aranda.

It was built during 1873. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  It is believed that Toongla was built by Maurice Scanlan some time after his purchase of the property in December 1873. It was a dairy farm at the time and he later mortgaged it to the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (1892). In 1898, William Moles bought Toongla and farm in 1898. William Moles was a founding member of Shellharbour Municipal Council in 1859 serving as an Alderman and its second Mayor. Moles was also acting Town Clerk for a time, served as the areas Senior Magistrate and one of the pioneer breeders of Australian Illawarra Short-horn cattle. The title passed to his daughters Barbara and Marion Douglas Moles after their father's death in 1911. They sold it to Mr. Leonard Anderson in February 1930. In 1987 the then owners Mr and Mrs Walsh requested that Permanent Conservation Order be placed over the property because of their concern for its long term protection. A Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 20 November 1987. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. The property is a portion of an estate, originally granted to John Paul and named \\"Tullimbar\\", after a local tribal leader. The original estate seems to have been divided mid-century into lesser portions, which were occupied by new settlers. Further research is necessary to identify the builder of \\"Toongla\\" and ascertain the year in which it was built. Maurice Scanlon and his family are the first settlers known to have resided on the property, arriving there in 1873. The Scanlon family initially referred to their residence as \\"Green Mount Villa\\". In 1886 the family changed the homestead's name to \\"Toongla\\". It is not known whether the present residence is the original homestead, or a second building erected by the Scanlon family in 1886. In 1898 the homestead was occupied by William Moles, a longstanding settler on the \\"Tullimbar\\" Estate. Moles had acquired a neighbouring portion of the estate in 1859, and had erected \\"Hillcrest\\", a slab cottage, behind the site of the Tullimbar School (see separate entry). The Moles family were important pioneers in the local dairy industry. The property had close associations with the development of the Illawarra Shorthorn breed of cattle. The house is believed to have been built by Maurice Scanlan some time after his purchase of the original property in December 1873. It was a dairy farm at the time and he later mortgaged it to the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney (1892). In 1898, William Moles, the second Mayor of Shellharbour Municipality, moved to this residence from his Tongarra property. Title passed to his daughters Barbara and Marion Douglas Moles after their father's death in 1911. They sold it to Mr Leonard Anderson in February 1930. Owners in the late 1980s early 1990s were Mr M. and Mrs J. Simon.  Description  Toongla is sited on a north facing ridge off a quiet country lane along the fertile valley leading to the Macquarie Pass National Park. The residence enjoys commanding rural, lake and escarpment views. The property is approximately mostly grassed paddock with a large garden around the house with well established trees beside. The present land area is . Curtilage includes area within a radius of the house. ;House: Toongla is a largely intact Victorian villa constructed of colonial bonded brickwork, now painted, its main roof has a hipped iron form with three large stuccoed chimneys. Possibly a smaller building originally, later extended to the east, as evidenced by the chimneys. The northern verandah has a bellcast roof bevelled posts and iron lace brackets. The facade is asymmetrical, featuring two 12-paned windows, three French windows opening onto the front verandah and a main four panelled door with sidelight. Stone steps, with masonry piers either side, lead up to a wide entrance door. Glass transom lights, timber & glass side panels. Other windows are double-hung, with six panes in the top frame. The interiors have cedar joinery, some iron ceilings, two interesting fireplaces of marbled wood with tiles and grates.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council. 27 May 1987. It has an established garden and orchard. ;Outbuildings: There is a small slab outbuilding at the rear with an iron roof, a former laundry,remains of sites of other outbuildings. A portion of the original slab kitchen may still stand at the rear. The house is tenanted. The building is completed in the Late Victorian villa architectural style. The building materials used include Colonial bonded brickwork, hipped iron roof, stuccoed chimneys, cedar joinery, and iron ceilings.National Trust of Australia (NSW). 1982. = Condition = As at 3 October 2000 the archaeological potential was high (remains of slab building at rear and outbuildings). = Modifications and dates = 1997 - addition of shower and toilet to existing laundry.  Heritage listing  As at 3 October 2000, Toongla was an example of a largely intact Victorian Villa. It is associated with William Moles, a founding member of Shellharbour Council, Acting Town Clerk, Senior Magistrate and one of the pioneers of Shorthorn cattle breeding in the Illawarra. An exceptional late 19th century homestead. One of the last remaining examples of this particular architectural style in the area. Strong links with historical and industrial development of the area and an exceptionally high degree of aesthetic beauty. A good example of a traditional Georgian type, set on a high hill and prominent on views from the main road. Distinguished by its elegant, dominant, iron roof and verandah. Important historical associations with the local dairy industry and the development of the Illawarra Shorthorn breed of cattle. Toongla was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria.

She was secretary general of the Sindicato Labrego Galego (SLG) for 18 years and, since 2014, has been a Member of the European Parliament. Biography Lidia Senra took Baccalaureate studies in Monforte de Lemos and then began to collaborate with the Committees of Axuda to Loita Labrega in the mid-1970s. In 1984, during the second congress of Comisi√≥ns Labregas, she was elected to be responsible for organization and finance. Five years later, in the third congress, she acceded to the general secretariat of the Sindicato Labrego Galego (SLG). At that time, the Sindicato Labrego Galego-Comisi√≥ns Labregas was in the orbit of the Galician People's Union (UPG), the Marxist-Leninist party that constituted the nucleus of the Galician Nationalist Bloc (in fact, it was the UPG that chose the union's secretaries general), and the SLG constituted the agrarian front of the BNG. Senra was re- elected three times. In 2007, she announced that she would not run for re- election. As secretary general of the SLG, she was a member of the executive of the Coordination Paysanne Europ√©enne (transformed in 2008 into the European Coordination of Via Campesina, the world peasant movement that brings together organizations from the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Europe). In addition, she actively participated in the European Social Forums of Florence (2002), Paris (2003), and London (2004). Despite her initial closeness to the UPG, she distanced herself from this organization. Thus, during the stage of the Galician bipartite (2005‚Äì2009), the union maintained a confrontation with the Xunta de Galicia's Ministry of Rural Affairs, in the hands of the UPG. Senra was integrated into the current Encontro Irmandi√±o in 2009, sponsored by Xos√© Manuel Beiras. Senra left the Galego Nationalist Bloc in 2012, at the same time as the supporters of Beiras, who later formed the Anova‚ÄìNationalist Brotherhood. After the internal vote in which Anova narrowly decided to stand for the 2014 European Parliament elections at the hands of the United Left (with which it formed the Galician Left Alternative in the Parliament of Galicia), Senra was proposed as its head of list in the candidacy of the Plural Left by the leader of Anova, Xos√© Manuel Beiras, and endorsed mostly by the militants. Senra was in fifth place in the candidature, being one of the six elected MEPs. After the constitution of the chamber, she joined the Confederal Group of the European United Left‚ÄìNordic Green Left (GUE-NGL), and was part of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. On 4 March 2017, Lidia Senra left the Confederal Group of the GUE-NGL.

He was parish priest of the Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa () from 1996 to 2013. Intriago was dismissed from his priestly functions by the Archdiocese of Guayaquil after there were complaints that Intriago sexually abused and tortured minors. Intriago told his victims that to help themselves and their families, they needed to suffer through a secret sacrifice, which he named the dynamic of sin (). The Catholic Church does not approve such rituals. Intriago is known for his anti-abortion stance and for founding the Christian Life Movement in Ecuador. Christian Life Movement was founded by Luis Fernando Figari in Peru; he was also accused of sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of minors. Biography =Early life and education= Intriago was born in 1956 in Guayaquil, Ecuador, and is the second of four brothers. He graduated from Unidad Educativa Javier, a Jesuit school in Guayaquil. In his youth he was extroverted and sociable, liked to talk a lot, partied with his friends, and surfed in Monta√±ita and other places on the Santa Elena Peninsula. From the age of 18, Intriago frequently visited the Schoenstatt Shrine in Guayaquil. He was part of Christian group for eight years, which brought him closer to the Catholic faith. When he was 26 years old and about to finish his studies in civil engineering and marry his girlfriend, Intriago was overwhelmed by a mixture of solitude and emptiness. Shortly after, during a few minutes of reflection at the Schoenstatt Shrine, he decided to give his life to the priesthood. =Priestly life= alt=Logo of the Christian Life Movement depicted by an anchor over waves circled by the words \\"Christian life movement\\" in four languages (English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian) Intriago worked in the neighborhood parishes of Guayaquil‚ÄîUrdesa and La Alborada. In 1996 he became the parish priest of the Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa (). There he exercised his priestly duties and organized the processions of Holy Week, with religious groups such as the Legion of Mary, , Charismatic Movement, , and Christian Life Movement. In 2002, Intriago founded the Catholic group Christian Life Movement in Guayaquil. There he counseled young people. The group had more the 1,500 members in 2005. Scandal of sexual abuse and torture of minors =Background= In 2003, he was informally and repeatedly reprimanded by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for active homosexual behavior. He was again reprimanded in 2009 when the congregation was made aware that Intriago was having nocturnal encounters with minors who were members of the Christian Life Movement. =Precedents= Intriago was accused of sexual abuse and torture of minors by means of a practice (dynamic of sin ()) not recognized by the Catholic Church. In 2013 Archbishop Antonio Arregui suspended him from his priestly activities. He befriended the founder of the Christian Life Movement, Luis Fernando Figari (also accused of sexual abuse of minors), in Lima, and brought the Christian Life Movement to Ecuador. =The dynamic of sin= Starting in 2013, Intriago was accused of sexual abuse and torture of minors. Intriago was able to manipulate the minors by telling them that a heavenly voice had told him that they were the chosen ones, the anointed, who would change the world. Intriago researched the private lives of the minors. He chose minors who had economic, emotional, or familial problems, as well as minors who had family members with incurable diseases. After he gained the trust of the minor, he proposed that the minor suffer the dynamic of sin, which consisted of a series of acts and sessions ranging from light to strong. In this rite Intriago fulfilled the function of the devil and the world, and the minor served the function of himself‚Äîas a Christian Catholic who would fight against the world and would have to feel the damage and pain of sin. The minor was stripped of clothes until half-naked or naked, blindfolded, hands and feet bound, and then hung from a tube. There the minor would suffer through a series of torture, such as blow or electric shocks. Intriago would also pass his scratchy beard over the face and body of the victim, wrestle with the minor, and crush the victim by lying on top of them. During the rite, Intriago was also half-naked and would have skin-to-skin contact with the victim. After finishing the right, Intriago told the victim that the rite was for the purpose of improving the world, improving the victim's life, improving the health of a family member in serious condition, or any other problems that may be happening. He always made it clear that they had to keep it secret‚Äîit should only be between Intriago, the abused minor, and God. Intriago justified this secret with biblical-sounding phrases like \\"do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing because it would not understand\\". =Complaint= The first to denounce Intriago for these acts was Juan Jos√© Bayas in 2013. Bayas was 23 years old at the time, but he suffered through the dynamics of sin when he was 15. =Sentence= On May 12 2018, Intriago faced 25 years of jail.https://www.connectas.org/revelan- sancion-del-vaticano-a-prestigioso-sacerdote-por-ritual-no-aceptado-de-la- dinamica-del-pecado/ See also *Luis Fernando Figari *Karadima case *Crimen sollicitationis *Catholic Church sexual abuse cases *Christian Life Movement *Sodalitium Christianae Vitae *Sodalit Family *Marcial Maciel *Julio C√©sar Grassi References Category:1956 births Category:Living people Category:Catholic priests convicted of child sexual abuse Category:Catholic Church sexual abuse scandals in Latin America Category:Child sexual abuse in Ecuador Category:Ecuadorian criminals Category:Ecuadorian Roman Catholic priests Category:Laicized Roman Catholic priests ","title":"Luis Fernando Intriago P√°ez"},{"id":"57973792","text":"The 2018 Bahamas Bowl was a college football bowl game played on December 21, 2018.

It was the largest of the four hemp factories in Greece, in production and facilities. It is also a unit of the Water Museum of Edessa, where it is placed at the site \\"Megalos Kremnos\\" next to the traditional quarter of the city and the well-known Park of Waterfalls. It operated as a factory until 1967, and then it was abandoned. Later in 1997, the factory turned into a Recreation and Education Center, where it continues to operate until 2014, when it is finally closed.  Establishment  The founding of the company was made in 1908 by the company Totskas and Co. and other smaller shareholders from Thessaloniki, who wanted to develop the textile industry in Greece. The choice of location where the factory was built was because Edessa's wider area was abundant in waterfalls where it would help to operate the engines as they were supported by waterworks. Its address was assigned to the experienced industrialist Iraklis Hatzidimoula  Acne 1928-1950  The main building where ropes been created. The full edge of the factory is placed in the period 1928 - 1940, during which it employs 150 workers (mainly from Edessa). Particularly during the interwar period, the factory covered the demand for fabrics and twine all over Greece. Coarse ropes went to Crete (the largest consumption center), to Thessaly and Epirus, while the thin ropes in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. However, there was a stagnation in the distribution of products between October and March.  Decline 1952-1966  The loss of aquaculture acquis, the amount of debts to banks, shareholders' disputes, and government led to bankruptcy and closure of the factory in May 1966. The 100 workers of the Hemp Factory founded the \\"Production Cooperative Pella\\" and undertake its management. Later in 1967, the management committee asked I.S.R.S (Industrial Safety Regulation Staff) a loan to continue the factory operation, but in vain. The factory closed and the state became the owner.

Later, the Hemp Factory became part of the \\"Mill Rehabilitation Program\\" for the complete upgrading and refurbishment of the surrounding area. The program included: *Remodeling of the Industrial complex *Reconstruction of old Machine site and Shelters *Establishment of Industrial Museum. *Construction of 2 outdoor lifts to facilitate access *Construction of sites for recreational and cultural use. Upon completion of the rehabilitation, the site is re-opened as a Culture and Event site, focusing on highlighting the history of the factory. It has also been incorporated as a new section of the Edessa Water Museum. = Shut down in 2014-today= After 17 years of continuous operation the center closes and the complex is deserted. The cost of reopening is high as debt and maintenance costs are high. Lifts have been deactivated since the end of 2013 to cut spending, which has subsequently proved to be fatal as it has reduced tourist traffic even further.

It was first published by Scribner in 2016. It follows the friendship of two American filmmakers, Meadow Mori and Carrie Wexler, who grow up together and remain friends as their careers rise. Plot In the 1980s, teenage Meadow Mori writes an experimental essay during which she watches City Lights twenty times in a row; she does this because her favourite filmmaker claimed everything he learned about film he learned from watching this film 20 times. After her project is done, she sends a copy to the filmmaker, who invites her to lunch. The two begin an affair, and Meadow defers university to live with him. He warns Meadow that he is ill and urges her to use his fame and the scandal of their relationship to acquire fame and fortune. However, when he dies Meadow only takes a few tokens and prefers to find her own path to success, never publishing the love letters he wrote her. The story is part of an online essay Meadow wrote, and comments reveal that the man in question is thought to be Orson Welles. Meadow eventually heads to Gloversville where she makes experimental films. Her first documentary feature is an interview with her younger lover, whom she records as he is increasingly drunk, based on Portrait of Jason. The film gains enough acclaim that Meadow is able to make a second film, Kent State: Recovered, about student protests over the Vietnam war. She is nominated for an Oscar for her film. Carrie makes a well-received student short and is able to use that to get enough funding to make her first feature film, which Meadow finds conventional and uninteresting. Searching for a new subject, Meadow learns of \\"Nicole\\", a woman who seduced powerful Hollywood men a few years earlier by cold calling them and talking to them over the phone. She manages to track down Nicole, who is actually a woman nicknamed \\"Jelly\\", who is partially sighted, somewhat overweight, and was middle aged at the time she made these calls, inspired by her then boyfriend who was involved in phone phreaking. Jelly is reluctant to be interviewed for Meadow's film until she learns that Jack Cusano, a composer with whom she fell in love, has agreed to be interviewed. Carrie watches the film, in which Jack finally meets \\"Nicole\\" and is disgusted with her. Jelly accuses Meadow of using her pain for her own selfish purposes. Though Meadow apologizes to Jelly, she is haunted by her words. Meadow decides to make a documentary on Sarah Mills, a woman in prison for arson who is accused of murdering her husband and child. Though Sarah says the fire was an accident, she admits that she had the opportunity to save her daughter and deliberately chose not to. Meadow destroys the footage. Later, Meadow is also involved in a car accident. She takes stock of her life and reflects on the cruel person she has become. She abandons filmmaking and decides to dissolve most of her trust fund, living a simple, pared- down life. She eventually takes up teaching. Jack Cusano discovers that he is dying and, tired of the people in his life who only want to talk about his impending death, reconnects with Jelly. He never tells her he is dying. Things continue to go well with Carrie, who becomes a popular director of commercial films and always credits Meadow with her success. She suggests that Meadow's essay on her love affair with \\"Orson Welles\\" was complete fiction. On Boxing Day, after being stood up by her son, Carrie decides to reunite with Meadow, and they watch Daisies together in the theatre. Characters *Meadow Mori, an L.A.-born wealthy filmmaker who is interested in documentaries and experimental films *Carrie Wexler, an L.A.-born woman who is haunted by her childhood plumpness. Carrie grows up middle class in an upper-class neighborhood and goes on to direct successful comedies. Reception The novel was well received. The New York Times praised it as \\"a combo-deal of a novel that mixes the silliness of a popcorn romp with the intellectual seriousness of a one-camera talking-head commentary.\\" The Irish Times called it \\"an affectionate homage to the cinematic form itself.\\" The Guardian enjoyed how Spiotta's writing \\"resists easy depiction at every turn.\\" References Category:Novels about film directors and producers Category:2016 American novels Category:Charles Scribner's Sons books ","title":"Innocents and Others"},{"id":"57973904","text":"Kilwa Thermal Power Station, is a planned 318 megawatts, liquefied natural gas-fired thermal power station in Tanzania.

After early success with private service providers, the software was spun out into its own non-profit organization, known as Case Commons. In 2012, Indiana's Department of Child Services was the first state agency to implement Casebook as a mobile and web-based solution for its child welfare caseworkers. This effort led to the organization receiving the Design for Experience Award in 2014 and a Code for America Technology Award in 2015. In 2017, the organization helped the state of California's Child Welfare Digital Services agency learn how to build and ship software. That same year, under the leadership of a new CEO, Tristan Louis, Casebook PBC entered into a national partnership with KPMG, allowing KPMG to leverage the Casebook platform as its exclusive solution for the child welfare vertical. In late 2018, Casebook PBC moved from a non-profit status to a public benefit corporation model and rebranded from Case Commons to Casebook PBC.  Products  The company offers the Casebook Platform, a set of core components that can be used for a variety of Human Services software developments. In 2019, the company launched provider management software aimed at small and medium-sized providers in human services . Because of its historical background in the Child Welfare space, the company also offers a suite of applications that, when put together, can allow states to assemble a CCWIS-ready child welfare system.  Awards and recognitions  Casebook PBC was recognized as a govtech 100 company by Government Technology Magazine in 2019 and 2020. The company was also the recipient of the 2019 Stevie Awards for Innovation and Startup of the Year, and was named as one of the \\"2019 Best for the World\\" companies by B Lab. In 2020 Casebook received a mention at the Fast Company's 2020 World Changing Ideas Awards.

She studied in the Department of Time and Space-based Art at the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki, receiving a master's degree in 1998. She has also studied at the Slade School of Fine Art in London and in the first edition of the Feature Expanded training programme. In 2004‚Äì2007 she chaired the Artists' Association of Finland, being the first woman and the first video artist to hold that position.Selkokari, Hanne (ed.). 150 vuotta kuvataiteilijoiden puolesta.

In 2000‚Äì2003 she chaired the interdisciplinary Artists‚Äô Association MUU, founded in 1987 to represent new and experimental forms of art. In 2012‚Äì2016 she served as the film commissioner for media art at the Promotion Centre for Audiovisual Culture AVEK. Starting from 2018 she is working on a three-year grant from the Kone Foundation on a project to explore the effects of climate change using different formats of moving image. N√§s√§nen lives and works in Helsinki, Finland and is married to the Finnish media artist Pekka Sassi.  Art work  Elena N√§s√§nen works with video installations and elements of narrative cinema. She works with familiar elements of narrative film, deconstructing and reconstructing scenes to tell a new kind of story where the action often takes place outside the space or time depicted and is left for the viewer to fill in.V√§kiparta, Kirsi: The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime - about films by Elena N√§s√§nen. In: Elena N√§s√§nen. Helsinki, 2007. . Sound is always an essential component in her works. Works involving narrative storytelling typically feature female characters often at a crossroads, faced with the challenge to choose, or reaching for a goal that seems far away.Langinauer, Christine: Kadonnutta el√§m√§√§ etsim√§ss√§.

For example, in \\"Before Rain\\" (1998) short sequences in ‚Äòfilm noir‚Äô style are used to create suspense that stays unresolved, in \\"Night\\" (2007) a female character follows an urge to leave the house at night to follow a path deep into a forest, and in \\"Wasteland\\" (2009) a group of women are on their way to an unknown task and destiny.Eisenlohr, Klaus: Elena N√§s√§nen in Directors Lounge, Berlin 2010.

Time is strictly connected with images and the works seem to have an autonomous time dimension. \\"The Spell\\" and \\"Round\\", premiered in the same exhibition in 2011, have been seen to reflect two different approaches to time. In \\"The Spell\\" a group of people have fallen asleep in the middle of a party while ‚Äútime ticks by slowly but surely, like the timeline of modern western society‚Äù. The two-channel video installation \\"Round\\" shows the same series of events experienced in parallel by a female and a male actor. Time seems to stand still and the recurring sequence of events ‚Äúcorresponds to the cyclic concept of time of many early and eastern religions and cultures‚Äù. Despite the scant action there is ‚Äùstrong cinematic tension‚Äù where ‚Äútime becomes condensed‚Äù.Uimonen, Anu: Juhlaseurue vaipui uneen. [The party fell asleep.] Helsingin Sanomat, 10.11.2011. Nature has more than a secondary role in her works and sometimes seems to dominate the image and the characters. In non-narrative works nature has a central role or the focus is on the relationship between humans and the nature.Uimonen, Anu: Sumu leijuu n√§yttelysalissa.

It became well known as the sneaker-wearing goose. Andy was killed in 1991 by an unknown perpetrator.  Background  The grey goose was born in 1987 without webbed feet and lived on a farm in Harvard, Nebraska. When Andy was two years old, Gene Fleming from nearby Hastings became aware of the plight of the bird. Fleming was a member of a local charity for disabled children and inventor and he thought he would be able to help. Fleming took care of Andy and his mate, Polly, and moved them to his farm in Hastings. Initial attempts at providing Andy with more mobility included a skateboard-like prosthesis which did not work. Fleming then fitted Andy with specially adapted baby-sized shoes and he successfully taught the bird to walk with them. Subsequently, Andy caught the attention of the media and a sportswear manufacturer, that offered a lifetime deal to supply shoes ‚Äì the bird wore out a pair of shoes in about one month. Andy became a role model, especially for disabled children. With his shoes, Andy was able to walk, swim and fly which was supposed to give hope to people with disabilities. On October 19, 1991, Andy disappeared, and a day later he was found dead in a local park with his head and wings removed. The local community collected US$10,000 as a reward to apprehend the murderer; however, the killer could not be identified.

It is owned by The Pocahontas Times Inc., and has a circulation of 4,629.  History  Founded in 1882 in Huntersville by Reverend William T. Price, the paper was initially meant to keep his sons busy and provide extra income to pay for their college education. The paper moved to Marlinton in 1892. The paper is most famous for the writings of its long- time editor and publisher Cal Price. Price, who bought out his brother's share of the paper in 1906, ran the paper until his death in 1957. Politically engaged, his editorials often fell towards the conservative side of the spectrum: he was, for example, an ardent supporter of Governor Ephraim Morgan's anti-Union America First Day. But in his 51 years as editor his reputation, both regionally and nationally, was built on his widely syndicated column \\"Field Notes\\" which focused on stories of local wildlife, and advanced the cause of conservation. Due to both his literary and political efforts, West Virginia named a state forest after him while he was still living, a fact of which Price said he was \\"sinfully proud.\\" After Price's death in 1957, the paper was run by his daughter Jane Price Sharp for many years. Elected president of the West Virginia Press Association, she became known nationally for her continued use of handset type, which the paper used into the 1980s. Her father, she said, had bought a linotype machine in 1901 but hadn't taken to it, and had sent it back; they had continued with hand set type since that time, although by the late 1970s they had to produce everything but the front page in offset type as that was how ads were supplied. In an ironic turn of events, the paper‚Äîthe last to use handset type‚Äîbecame the earliest in West Virginia to adopt desktop publishing, after a 1985 flood destroyed their printing plant. Jane Sharp died in 2017, at the age of 95. The paper is seen as an authoritative source of coverage for the county, and was sourced for national AP story as recently as 2017.

In her teens, she was a student of Edward A. Lefebre (1835‚Äì1911), pre-eminent saxophonist of the nineteenth century and soloist with Gilmore and Sousa's bands. During the 1890s, when female woodwind and brass players were uncommon, she performed extensively throughout the northeastern United States with her father, harpist Henry Clay Mecklem (1841‚Äì1915). The pair appeared in a wide variety of venues popular during the Gilded Age including lyceum; YMCA and temperance organizations; meetings of fraternal societies, labor organizations, and civic groups; benefit concerts; solos with professional wind bands; and amusement parks. Mecklem recorded twelve wax phonograph cylinders at the Edison Laboratories on 23 April 1892. After her marriage in 1900 to Bertram Lyon Hackenberger (1871‚Äì1932), she ceased playing professionally, but continued to perform as an active participant in the Progressive-era women's club movement. 600x600px  Professional performing career  = Lyceum = Lyceum tours comprised the mainstay of Bessie and H. C. Mecklem's performing itinerary. A lyceum ‚Äúcourse‚Äù consisted of a series of monthly programs for which audience members purchased a season‚Äôs subscription. Lyceum programs combined education and entertainment functions, offering ‚Äúlectures by humorists, as well as dramatic readings, impersonations, concerts, magic acts, and other ‚Äòlighter‚Äô fare.‚Äù The Mecklems entered \\"the lyceum field when musicians first began to appear on its programs on a regular basis.\\"Smialek & Logrande, p. 96. The Mecklems were billed as a saxophone-harp duo. Henry Clay accompanied Bessie on her featured selections in addition to performing his own harp solos. They frequently shared their programs with various dramatic readers or humorists. Other musical soloists, chamber groups, or vocal ensembles were sometimes included. The duo was managed by Alonzo Foster's Star Lyceum Bureau. The Mecklems occasionally appeared with Foster‚Äôs New York Stars during the 1891-92 season. From 1892 through 1894, the Mecklems and elocutionist Florence Russell performed as the New York Ideal Trio, sometimes billed as the New York Ideal Concert Company.Smialek & Logrande, p. 96. On 19 May 1892, the New York Ideal Trio shared the program with five other performers in a concert presented at Toronto‚Äôs Broadway Tabernacle. A review from the Toronto Empire stated,\\"The duets by Miss Bessie Mecklem and her father, introducing the saxophone and harp, were of peculiar interest to the audience, the two instruments in conjunction being a genuine novelty. The young lady showed much ability and Mr. Mecklem‚Äôs harmonious work on the harp was splendidly done.\\" The Mecklems were engaged as part of the Black Patti Concert Company on 10 May 1893, at the Strong Place Baptist Church in South Brooklyn, assisted by humorist Fred Emerson Brooks. The Mecklems‚Äô performances as part of the Black Patti Concert Company were notable in that they resulted in a racially mixed program of performers, a rare situation at the time.Smialek & Logrande, p. 113. The company‚Äôs featured performer, soprano Sissieretta Jones (1869-1933), became one of the most famous black musicians in America after the Civil War. Jones was known as the ‚ÄúBlack Patti‚Äù for comparisons of her singing to that of Adelina Patti, one of the nineteenth century‚Äôs most celebrated opera stars. The Mecklems paired with Walter Pelham, ‚Äúa distinguished English humorist, poet and mimic elocutionist,‚Äù for a tour of lecture courses in western New York during November 1894. = YMCA and temperance = As part of its programming, the YMCA sponsored lecture and entertainment courses similar to those of the lyceum. Because the audience for YMCA lecture courses comprised mostly young men, as opposed to a more heterogeneous composition in the lyceum, these events tended to have a more consistently moralistic, or motivational, emphasis. YMCA engagements made up the largest portion of the Mecklems‚Äô documented bookings.Smialek & Logrande, p. 99. H. C. Mecklem was a supporter of the Temperance movement. Five of the Mecklems‚Äô documented performances were associated with anti-alcohol institutions or organizations. One of their earliest engagements included the American Temperance Union‚Äôs Centennial Day service at Chickering Hall in New York in April 1889. They appeared twice at events sponsored by the New York Temperance Union. On 1 February 1891, ‚Äúa rare and delightful musical programme‚Äù was offered at Masonic Temple in New York City. After the musical selections, Citizen George Francis Train spoke on ‚ÄúThe Drink Customs Around the World.‚Äù A second engagement, on 21 February 1892, at the Grand Opera House Hall, Twenty-third Street and Eighth Avenue, featured the young Baptist orator Reverend E. S. Halloway. Holloway, pastor of the West Thirty-third Street Church, spoke on the Parkhurst Raid. = Fraternal societies, labor organizations, and civic groups = Membership in fraternal societies was widespread during the late 1800s, with an estimated participation of as many as one third of American adult males by 1920. Henry Clay Mecklem was among the first members of Longfellow Council, No. 675, of the Royal Arcanum, East Orange, New Jersey. Consequently, \\"the Mecklems frequently performed for fraternal orders, such as the Royal Arcanum, Order of Tonti, Fraternal Mystic Circle, Freemasons, Odd Fellows, Grand Army of the Republic, Farragut Association, Daughters of the American Revolution, and the Brooklyn Oxford Club. These engagements were nearly equal in number to their lyceum appearances. Social and fraternal organizations provided diversity to the types of performances the Mecklems presented, filled in open dates during tours, and increased their bookings overall.\\"Smialek & Logrande, p. 102. In addition to their work for fraternal organizations, the Mecklems performed during holiday observances and for labor groups. Civic groups that heard the Mecklems included the New York Press Club. The Mecklems also performed at events held by musical societies such as the Richmond, Virginia, Mozart Musicale; the St. Cecelia Society of Hudson, New York; and the Beethoven Choral Society of Newark, New Jersey.Smialek & Logrande, p. 104. = Benefit concerts = Benefit concerts for various charitable causes, large and small, were an integral part of the Mecklems‚Äô performance schedule. Some of these engagements took place in very prestigious venues. On 22 May 1890, the Mecklems participated in a joint benefit for the Babies‚Äô Ward of the Post Graduate Hospital and for the Actors‚Äô Fund, which took place concurrently at the Metropolitan Opera House and two other New York theaters. Nearly $7,000 was raised. Benefit concerts were often lengthy affairs and featured numerous contributors; before a packed house at the Met that evening, Bessie Mecklem appeared sixteenth on a program of eighteen different acts. In addition to benefits organized in support of a colleague who had fallen ill or experienced financial difficulties, performers often staged events to pay tribute to fellow artists who were completing extended engagements. The Mecklems donated their services for a number of church benefits. A month after their May 1893 performance with Sissieretta Jones at Strong Place Baptist Church in Brooklyn, they once again appeared with the Black Patti Concert Company. On June 6, they participated in a concert at the Lee Avenue Congregational Church, Brooklyn, to benefit the church‚Äôs Sunday School. The Mecklems joined the Black Patti Concert Company a third time on June 13, at the Emory M. E. Church in Jersey City, New Jersey. Both June performances featured humorist James S. Burdett. = Band concerts and tours = In early 1895, the Mecklems participated in two tours with the highly regarded Veteran Corps Band of Baltimore. A January Southern Tour took them through Virginia (to Richmond, Norfolk, with a return engagement to Richmond, then Lynchburg and Roanoke), then on to Pittsburgh and New York City. Their return to Baltimore was followed by a concert in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The reviewer of the Norfolk (Va.) Virginian found, \\"The saxaphone [sic] solos of Miss Bessie Mecklem were artistically performed, and her 'Then You‚Äôll Remember Me,' completely captured the audience. Miss Mecklem is an accomplished soloist, and her number received several encores.\\" In late February-early March 1896, the band swung through Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, with a final stop in Philadelphia. In 1895, H. C. Mecklem reported to Talent that Bessie ‚Äúplayed a saxophone solo at Central Park, N. Y., concert with Rogers‚Äô Seventh Regiment Band, July 27 and August 3. On the 27th, her solo received a double encore. Miss Mecklem is the first lady who has ever played before a Park audience.\\"  Women's club participation  At different periods of her married life, Bessie Mecklem Hackenberger participated in both the music- centered and general-purpose women's club formats. From 1902-1904, Hackeberger was a member of The East Orange, New Jersey, Tuesday Musical Club. The Tuesday Musical Club exemplified the women‚Äôs amateur arts association of the Early Progressive Era. In addition to performing for their colleagues during monthly meetings, the club‚Äôs members contributed to the community‚Äôs cultural life by presenting a series of public concerts each season. Although no longer a paid professional musician‚Äîas in the years prior to her marriage when she toured in the lyceum‚Äîthese activities enabled Hackenberger to continue to appear before a public audience on a regular basis. As one of the club‚Äôs most dynamic members, Hackenberger quickly attained status, succeeding its founder as president, until the demands of her husband‚Äôs career precluded her from taking office. The Hackenbergers moved from East Orange to Philadelphia (1904), Baltimore (1910), and Washington, DC (1911) as Bert Hackenberger's career advanced. Bessie did not join a women‚Äôs club during this time as the family‚Äôs means were modest and she was raising young children.Bertram, Jr (1901‚Äì1976), Ruth (1903‚Äì1993), and Samuel (1914‚Äì2012) She began to participate in organizations‚Äîsuch as the Red Cross and the Ladies Aid Society‚Äîthat contributed to the war effort during World War I. These activities, along with the domestic responsibilities her husband continued to expect of her, did not leave much time for performing on the saxophone. During her time in Washington, Hackenberger was able to perform just a few times each year in benefit concerts, a lyceum course, church services, fraternal society meetings, community events, and assemblies or individual classes of students at her children‚Äôs schools. In 1922, the Hackenbergers moved from Washington, DC, to Haddon Heights, a southern-New Jersey suburb with a population of approximately 3,000. Hackenberger soon joined the Haddon Heights Woman‚Äôs Club, which was divided into various departments that would suit each member‚Äôs interests and/or level of social engagement. Hackenberger was an active participant, performing regularly at club meetings and social events. Her pursuits during this period correspond with the larger post-war club movement‚Äôs shift from the goal of self-development to an emphasis on civic reform. As her participation in club activities expanded, music began to take a secondary role to her growing commitment to her community‚Äôs economic and social welfare as chair of the Legislative, Civics, and Welfare Departments. In recognition of her contributions to the Haddon Heights Woman‚Äôs Club, members unanimously elected Hackenberger a trustee on 10 April 1931.Haddon Heights Woman's Club Secretary Book (1929-1936). Haddon Heights Historical Society Archives, Haddon Heights, NJ Public Library, p. 64.  Performing repertoire  During the Gilded Age an increasing separation between cultivated and vernacular music occurred. By contrast, in the venues where the Mecklems performed there existed a greater ‚Äúfluidity and routine intersection between popular and elite culture.‚Äù Lyceum and YMCA entertainments, benefit and band concerts still employed the traditional practice of mixing musical genres and of programming an eclectic assortment of works from the cultivated and vernacular traditions.Ogasapian and Orr, p. 134. Bessie Mecklem‚Äôs performing repertoire generally reflected the range of American popular tastes: popular songs, operatic selections (with or without variations), dances (like the waltz or polka), original compositions, and sacred music. Her most frequently performed numbers were sentimental ballads, such as Henry Trot√®re (1855-1912) and lyricist Clifton Bingham‚Äôs (1859-1913) song In Old Madrid or Charles Albert White‚Äôs (1832-1892) Marguerite. ‚ÄúThen You‚Äôll Remember Me‚Äù from Michael William Balfe‚Äôs (1808-1870) opera The Bohemian Girl, follows the nineteenth-century trend of basing a popular song in English upon well- known operatic aria.Levine, p. 96. In addition to programming arrangements and transcriptions, Mecklem occasionally performed original compositions for saxophone. E. A. Lefebre‚Äôs Grand Easter Concert, given at the Academy of Music in Brooklyn on 6 April 1890, concluded with Harry Rowe Shelley‚Äôs (1858-1947) Quartet ‚ÄúThe Resurrection,‚Äù featuring Lefebre and Mecklem on alto saxophone, with piano and organ accompaniment.Noyes, pp. 79-80, 239. Another notable sacred song in Mecklem's repertoire was Chant Religieux by Jules Demersseman, which she performed on 2 July 1891 at the convention of the New York State Teachers‚Äô Musical Association, held in Utica, New York. Mecklem and many other Gilded-Age musicians frequently programmed Jean Faur√©‚Äôs (1830-1914) The Palms, also known as Palm Branches. After her marriage in 1900, the music Mrs. B. L. Hackenberger performed on the programs of the East Orange, New Jersey, Tuesday Musical Club focused more on transcriptions of serious compositions from the cultivated tradition rather than the popular and light classical numbers programmed during the lyceum and YMCA concerts of her teenage years. Her performances in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, during the 1920s returned to a reliance on light classics and sentimental songs, closest to the repertoire favored by saxophonists who worked in Chautauqua and lyceum. Although she did not embrace the evolving musical trends of the 1920s‚Äîwhich featured the saxophone‚Äôs growing prominence in syncopated dance music and jazz‚Äîher continued adherence to a cultivated, more genteel repertoire provided continuity to the music most closely associated with the instrument‚Äôs origins and early societal role.  Edison recording session  On 23 April 23, 1892, Bessie Mecklem \\"produced twelve Edison wax cylinders of saxophone solos with piano accompaniment. . . . The titles [she] rendered, probably several times each, were 'Ave Maria,' 'Sweet Lullaby Waltz,' 'Eugenia‚ÄîWaltz Song,' 'Nightingale Song,' 'Easter Song,' 'Love‚Äôs Old Sweet Song,' 'Christmas Song,' 'Grand Fantasie,' 'Dreaming,' 'Afterwards,' 'In Old Madrid,' and 'Palm Branches'‚Äîmostly slow-paced and comparatively simple numbers.\\" Although Mecklem was long thought to be the first saxophone soloist to make a phonograph record, \\"Edward A. Lefebre recorded for Edison, or one of its subsidiaries, some time in 1889, making him the first.\\"Smialek, p. 28 Mecklem still retains the distinction of being the first female saxophonist to record and likely the first female instrumental soloist as well.The other women listed in Edison engineer Theo Wangemann‚Äôs First Book of Phonograph Records were either vocalists or piano accompanists (Allen Koenigsberg (1987). Edison Cylinder Records, 1889-1912, 2nd ed. Brooklyn, NY: APM Press). \\"It is not known if Edison ever released any of Mecklem‚Äôs recordings for sale to the public.\\"Smialek, p. 5  References  Category:American saxophonists Category:American female musicians Category:1876 births Category:1942 deaths Category:Clubwomen ","title":"Bessie Mecklem Hackenberger"},{"id":"57974384","text":"Marius Hans J√∏rgensen (25 December 1889 - 22 April 1955) was a Danish rower.

The American Newspapers Representatives database lists the Bradford Era's daily paid circulation as 13,000 and its unpaid circulation as 2,500. Jim Eckstrom is the Executive Group Editor for the paper. It is owned by Community Media Group, Inc.  History  The Bradford Era was founded by Col. J.K. Haffey in 1875 as the Bradford Daily Era. By 1877 it was a four-page, 36 column paper. In 1879 the Bradford Era was consolidated with the Daily Breeze, a local paper that had been in publication for only a year. Many newspapers had preceded it in the county, but it was Bradford's 2nd newspaper, and it sought to distinguish itself as an independent alternative, under the motto, \\"We do not run the paper for glory or notoriety; that we could have obtained by becoming the president of a savings bank, pocketing the depositors' money, then going to State prison.\\" The Bradford Era's early reporting focused on the local oil industry. It initially mounted a defense of Equitable Oil against Standard Oil, and noted Equitable Oil's achievements even though Standard Oil was trying to squash all local competition. Other local papers such as the Blaze took even more extreme stand, the Blaze once printing in blood-red ink to protest Standard Oil. But by the early 1880s, the Bradford Era was owned and operated by businessmen with interests in Standard Oil and the Era became a mouthpiece for the company. In 1887, the Era Publishing Company was incorporated as a company and Patrick C. Boyle was the editor. Boyle and others used the paper to advocate against legislation, like the Billingsley Bill, which sought to regulate the oil industry. In addition, numerous editors for papers around the area were paid \\"pensions\\" for supporting Standard Oil interests in their printings. Boyle used the paper to attack people who opposed the monopoly of Standard Oil, such as Senator Lewis Emery . Emery grew so tired of the attacks that he had Boyle arrested for libel; Standard Oil paid to have him released from jail and to continue his slander campaign. Boyle was sent to Ohio in 1889 and put in charge of the Toledo Commercial. The Bradford Era was mentioned in testimony in United States v. Standard Oil, in which the government sued the company under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890; the case was argued at the 8th Circuit Court in Missouri in 1909. That decision was later taken to the Supreme Court in 1911 and upheld, in Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, and led to the break-up of Standard Oil into 34 separate and competing companies. In 1919, the Bradford Era became the first newspaper in the country to offer profit- sharing to its employees. The move was directed and announced by J.W. Milligan, who was president and general manager of the paper and its company, Era Publishing Company. J. W. Milligan served on a committee to present President Warren G. Harding (who had also been a newspaperman) with a chair purchased with funds contributed by publishers across the country. He managed the paper until his death in 1931. The paper continued under Milligan's sons until it was sold to M.R. Shale. In 1938, M.R. Shale oversaw the merger of three Pennsylvania papers, the Era, Evening Star-Record, and the Sunday Herald under the Era Publishing Company. Shale had recently purchased the Era. In the 1990s, Bradford Publishing Company, which then owned Bradford Era, was owned in part by David Radler and Conrad Black. Radler and Black were investigated by US Securities and Exchange Commission (and Canadian authorities as well) for fraud. Part of their fraud involved the purchase and sale of various newspapers in the Bradford Publishing Company. They were eventually indicted and Radler settled with the SEC and with Sun-Times Media Group. In 2017 & 2018 Bradford Publishing Company acquired many local newspapers in Pennsylvania and New York, including Olean Times Herald, The Ellicottville Times, Chautauqua Star, and Springville Times. Bradford Publishing Company is now owned by Community Media Group.  Notable reporting  In 1999, the Bradford Era joined several Pennsylvania newspapers in Project Open, a project to test the effectiveness of Pennsylvania's Sunshine Law and Right to Know Act, which required the release of requested public records. The newspapers' audits, through various requests to state and city government agencies, showed that many requests for public records were being denied, especially police records, telephone records, and salary records for school superintendents. In 2012, the Bradford Era reported on the trial of Samuel Slocum, a priest who was accused of having an inappropriate relationship with a minor. In 2016, the Bradford Era reported that Zippo Manufacturing Company, which is located in Bradford, PA, made its 550 millionth Zippo lighter.

In 1871, Claus Doescher manufactured the first handcrafted candy cane in Cincinnati, Ohio. The company is also widely known for its taffy product, the French Chew, which was introduced in 1896.  History  In 1871, immigrant brothers Claus, John and Heinrich (Henry) Doescher left their uncle's Cincinnati, Ohio, confectionery to start their own firm there, on Fifth Street between Broadway and Sycamore, forming the Doscher Brothers candy company. In that year Claus made their first candy canes. Their manufacturing process involved using real peppermint oil, cooking small batches in copper kettles, and hand-working to roll, knead, stripe, and hook the canes. Doscher Brothers also manufactured a caramel popcorn they called Popcorn Fritters. Doscher Bro's sold this popcorn to the Cincinnati Redlegs, making them one of the first concessioners in American baseball. In 1896, the Doschers capitalized on the Turkish taffy craze that was erupting in France and developed their recipe for the French Chew, their own taffy product which is still made today. Before being made into a more commercial or traditional bar form, French Chew was sold in large pieces that were broken up in candy stores and sold by the pound, leading to the French Chew's advertising slogan, \\"Freeze It, Crack It, Smack It.\\" John Doscher took over the company after Claus's death in 1883 and Claus's sons, Harry and John, became partners in the business shortly thereafter. Between 1932 and 1941, all three of the Doscher men passed away and Harry's wife, Elsie Doscher, who would have a finance degree from the University of Cincinnati, took over the company and kept the business alive through the Great Depression. She later passed the company to her son Harry II in 1953. He ran the business until the 1990s, at which time his son, Harry III, joined the business. In 2004, Greg Clark purchased Doscher's and in 2015 Chip Nielsen, along with his wife, and children, purchased the majority of the business.

Early life and family Margaret Dockrell was born Margaret Shannon on 18 March 1849, at 18 Charlotte Street, Dublin. She was the eldest child of solicitor George William Shannon and Emily Shannon (n√©e Goodman). She had two sisters and two brothers. She attended Alexandra College, and later lectures for women at Trinity College Dublin. She married Maurice Edward Dockrell in July 1875. The couple had seven children, one daughter and six sons. She went on to become a director and member of the board of her husband's family company: Messrs Thomas Dockrell & Sons & Co. Ltd. Political career Dockrell was an active member of the committee of the Dublin Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association, later known as the Irish Women's Suffrage and Local Government Association (IWSLGA), founded in 1876 to promote women's suffrage by democratic methods. She attended international women's suffrage conferences in Stockholm in 1911 and Budapest in 1913. She was also a committee member of the London Women's Suffrage Society, speaking on the role of women in local government at the International Congress of Women in London in 1899. The Irish Citizen listed her as a suitable woman candidate to run for the senate seat proposed by the Home rule bill in 1912. Dockell was a member of the National Union of Women Workers, sitting as a member of its public services committee. Like many of her contemporaries, she believed that women were best placed to address issues around health, societal moral well-being, and housing. From 1898, the Local Government (Ireland) Act, allowed women to be candidates for local government elections. Dockrell first ran as a candidate in the Urban District Council (UDC) of the Monkstown ward of Blackrock, County Dublin in the 1898 local elections, where she was returned as the 3rd of 9 elected, becoming one of only 4 women councillors elected in Ireland. Dockrell described herself as a unionist and a Protestant, sitting as a council on the Blackrock UDC until her death. She was the only woman councillor on that UDC until 1925 and the election of Ellen O'Neill. Dockrell was also the first woman chair of a UDC when she was elected to the position in 1906. Later life Despite the political and societal turmoil of the early 20th century in Ireland and the establishment of the Irish Free State, Dockrell continued in her commitment to local politics. This included being the first woman to be elected to a Dublin county council in 1920. Despite remaining a committed unionist, Dockrell worked with the Free State government. Following her husband's knighthood, she was also known as Lady Dockrell. Dockrell died on 29 June 1926, at her home \\"Camolin\\", Eaton Square, Monkstown. She is buried in Deans Grange Cemetery. Her son, Henry Morgan Dockrell was also a politician, and another son George was an Olympic swimmer.

It has inverted egg-shaped to spade-shaped mostly greyish softly hairy leaves, mostly without teeth and flattened globe-shapec flower heads of 5‚Äì7 cm (2.0‚Äì2.8 in) across, consisting of deep orange to crimson flowers, the bud and the style curving toward the center. It can be found in the Western Cape province of South Africa. The common name in English is Cederberg pincushion. It flowers between September and January, with a peak at the end of October.  Description  Leucospermum spathulatum is a creeping, mat-forming shrub of up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter, seldomly higher than 30 cm (1 ft) high. It grows from a single main stem that wedges between the rocks. The flowering stems are also trailing, 2‚Äì4 mm (0.08‚Äì0.16 in) thick, have short perpendicular side shoots and are covered in fine crisped hairs and some long straight hairs. The leaves are mostly greyish and covered in fine crisped hairs, but may eventually become hairless. They are inverted egg- to spade-shaped, 1¬Ω‚Äì3 cm (0.6‚Äì1.2 in) long and ¬æ‚Äì1¬æ cm (0.3‚Äì0.7 in) wide, mostly with an entire tip, but sometimes with two or three teeth. The flattened globe-shaped flowerheads of 5‚Äì7 cm (2.0‚Äì2.8 in) in diameter are seated or have a very short stalk of up to 1 cm (0.4 in) long, are set individually or grouped in pairs. The common base of the flowers in the same head is cone-shaped with a pointy tip, ¬æ‚Äì1 cm (0.3‚Äì0.4 in) long and ¬Ω‚Äì¬æ cm (0.2‚Äì0.3 in) across. The bracts that subtend each flower head are greyish because they are covered with densely matted woolly hairs, tightly overlapping and pressed against the flower head, oval with a pointy to pointed tip, about ¬æ cm (0.3 in) long and about 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, and cartilaginous in consistency. The bract that subtends each flower individually is oval in shape with a pointed tip (acuminate), about 7 mm (0.28 in) long and 4 mm (0.16 in) wide, at the base very densely set with woolly hairs and enclosing the perianth. The 4-merous perianth is 3¬Ω‚Äì4 cm (1.4‚Äì1.6 in) long, strongly arches towards the center of the head, and deep orange to crimson in colour. The lowest, fully merged, part of the perianth, called tube is about 8 mm (0.32 in) long, narrow near the base but strongly expanded higher up. The middle part (or claws), where the perianth is split lengthwise and coils tightly when the flower opens, is covered in silky to villous hairs. The upper part (or limbs), which enclosed the pollen presenter in the bud consists of four oval- shaped lobes with a pointy tip of about long, which are covered in silky hairs. From the perianth emerges a style of 3‚Äì4 cm (1.2‚Äì1.6 in) long that is tapering towards the end, bent to the center of the head, and almost at a right angle in the upper third. The thickened part at the tip of the style called pollen presenter is narrowly cylinder-shaped with a pointy tip and about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, with a groove acting as the stigma slightly tilted to the center of the heae. The ovary is subtended by four line-shaped scales of 3‚Äì4 mm (0.12‚Äì0.16 in) long. The fruit is approximately elliptic, 9 mm (0.36 in) long, almost hairless and shining.  Taxonomy  As far as we know, James Niven was the first to collect a specimen of the Cederberg pincushion for science, although the details of the location and time are unknown. Richard Anthony Salisbury in a book by Joseph Knight titled On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae that was published in 1809, described it and called it Leucadendrum bellidifolium. In 1810, Robert Brown described Niven‚Äôs specimen and called it Leucospermum spathulatum. These two were regarded synonymous by Edwin Percy Phillips and Otto Stapf. Because Salisbury did not indicate the type specimen, this cannot be confirmed and the description is not specific enough to rule out that L. bellidifolium is one of several other decumbent species, it cannot be used. Jean Louis Marie Poiret lumped Leucospermum with Protea in 1816, creating the new combination P. spathulata. Otto Kuntze reassigned it to the genus Leucadendron in 1891. Robert Harold Compton distinguished Leucospermum cereris. John Patrick Rourke considered all these names synonymous. The species name spathulatum is Latin and means ‚Äúspoon-shaped‚Äù.  Distribution, habitat and ecology  HabitThe Cederberg pincushion can be found from the Middelberg Plateau in the Cederberg Mountains in the north to the Kouebokkeveld Mountains in the south, and an isolated population on the Sawedge Peak near Worchester. It is most abundant in the Cederberg area, where it occurs on 1350‚Äì1700 m (4500‚Äì5500 ft) altitude. Here it grows on dry and exposed rocks of Table Mountain Sandstone, with an average annual precipitation of no more than 900 mm (35 in), mostly during the winter and some of it as snow. The plants root in crevices from which horizontal branches which spread creating a low shrub of up to 3 m (10 ft) in diameter. Mature plants may develop into mats up to 3.0 m in diameter. The flowers are pollinated by birds. After the fruits fall from the plants about two months after flowering, these are collected by native ants who transport them to their underground nests. Mature plants do not survive the wildfires that naturally occur in the fynbos the Cederberg pincushion lives, but it revives from the seeds that remained safe underground.  Conservation  The Cederberg pincushion is considered a near-threatened species.

Location The water treatment facility is under construction in the seaside town of Witsand, in Hessequa Local Municipality, in the Western Cape Province, at the mouth of the Breede River. This is approximately , by road, south-east of Cape Town, the nearest large city. Overview The town of Witsand is a tourist attraction, with a low- season population of approximately 300 people. During the tourist high-season, the population swells to over 3,000 people, leading to freshwater scarcity in the town. To address that scarcity, the government of the Western Cape and the French government, decided to jointly develop and fund he Witsand water purification project. Technology The WSDP is the first desalination plant in South Africa, that uses solar energy to power its processes. Its new technology applications, allow for the elimination of storage batteries in the design. The plant's new Osmosun technology, involves the use of a specialized \\"intelligent\\" membrane that is able to continue delivering reverse osmosis, even when the sun goes behind a cloud, thus reducing the amount of solar energy delivered. The energy delivered would increase again when the clouds moved away. That ability to \\"soften\\" the variability in the energy delivered, preserves the reverse osmosis membrane. At night, when there is no sun, the design allows the plant to switch to conventional grid-electricity and continue working all through the darkness, until the sun rises the next morning. Construction and cost The budgeted cost of the plant is ZAR:8.6 million (approx. US$650,000), to be shared equally between the governments of the Western Cape and that of France. The unit cost of the purified water at this plant is between ZAR:7 to ZAR:8 (US$0.52 to US$0.60) for every . In comparison, the temporary diesel-fueled desalination plant at Strandfontein, in Cape Town, produces potable water at ZAR:35 to ZAR:40 (US$2.62 to US$3.00) for every 1,000 liters. If this project is a success, it might be reproduced in other parts of the country, where drought is a problem. Challenges In order to generate enough solar energy for its internal processes, the plant needs to accommodate the requisite solar panels. This requirement for large areas to install solar panels, may restrict the project's reproducibility in crowded cities like Cape Town.

In 1922 he withdrew from the army to dedicate himself to writing, in December 1927 becoming a member of the National Peasants' Party, which propelled him to serve as communications minister.
