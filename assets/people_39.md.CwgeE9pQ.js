Born in Anderlecht, Schevenels' father was the secretary of the National Federation of Metal Workers, and Walter followed in his footsteps, soon becoming secretary of the union's Antwerp region. In 1929, Schevenels was selected to become deputy general secretary of the International Federation of Trade Unions (IFTU), and in 1931 he succeeded as its general secretary. He maintained a relatively low profile, opposing both fascism and communism, and focusing on ensuring the federation's survival through political and financial crises. During World War II, Schevenels ran the IFTU from London, and closely followed the policies of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC). The TUC, in response, tried to get him elected as the first general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), but he was instead made assistant general secretary, with responsibility for industry. A few years later, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) was formed as an anti-communist split from the WFTU, and Schevenels again hoped to be elected as general secretary, but was opposed by the American Federation of Labor on the grounds that he had co-operated with communists in the WFTU. Instead, he became the secretary of the Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD and soon also of the European Regional Organisation of the ICFTU, serving until his death in 1966.

Education Vendruscolo is a graduate in physics of the University of Trieste (Italy). He received a Master of Science (MSc) and a PhD in condensed matter physics at the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste, Italy. He then worked as a postdoctoral researcher, at the Weizmann Institute, Israel with Eytan Domany as a supervisor (1996‚Äì1998) and at the University of Oxford (1999‚Äì2001) under the supervision of Chris Dobson. Research and career He was appointed as an independent academic at the University of Cambridge as a Royal Society University Research Fellow (2001), as a Lecturer (2006), and then as a Reader (2008) in Theoretical Chemical Biology. He is now Professor of Biophysics at the same university. He is also Director of Chemistry of Health, and Co- Director of the Centre for Misfolding Diseases at the University of Cambridge. Vendruscolo provided contributions in the field of protein folding, misfolding and aggregation. He introduced the approach of simulating complex protein structures in transient or otherwise undetectable states (transition states, transient intermediates, transient aggregates, etc.) using exploitable experimental data as restraints. He edited computational programs able to predict essential characteristics of protein folding and protein aggregation. In a collaboration with other scholars he dissected the process of Amyloid fibril formation in its microscopic steps and computed programs to analyse experimental kinetic time courses and study effects of Small molecules and other agents.

History The palazzo was built in the 17th century, initially of only two floors. In the mid-18th century, the structure got to its present size and look. The palace was acquired in the second half of the 1800s by the nobleman Franz Edler von Hruschka. It is currently owned by the Brandolini Rota family. In the 19th century, the palace was adapted to host the hotel Allbergo dell' Universo, and for a short time it became the home of the famous soprano Toti Dal Monte and poet Robert Browning. In more recent times, the palace hosted the Union of Societies, one of the last gentlemen's clubs in Italy. The building is now a private home. Architecture Palazzo Brandolin Rota is a three-storey building, with a mezzanine level between the ground floor and the first noble floor. The fa√ßade on the Grand Canal is quite simple, with a rounded water portal in the center. Each of the two noble floors‚Äîerected in different epochs but looking substantially the same‚Äîhas nine round-headed openings, with the five central units joined to form pentaforas. The balustrades cover all the openings of the first noble floor and only the pentafora of the second one. The building has a raised fa√ßade on its top part, terminating with a tympanum of two square single-light windows and a pair of large chimneys.

In 1925, she became the world's first female military pilot when she graduated from the Military Aviation School in Yegoryevsk near Moscow. Although she wanted to become a fighter pilot, given her excellent examination results, she was encouraged stay on at the school as an instructor, training some of Russia's most successful female World War II pilots, including Nina Raspopova. She later spent 30 years as headmistress of a village school at Cholpon-Ata in Kyrgyzstan. On her retirement, she returned to Moscow. Biography Born at the turn of the 20th century, Zina√Øda Kokorina was the daughter of a gold prospector in the Ural Mountains. Brought up in Perm, she lived in a poor home but as a bright child, she was admitted to secondary school. In 1916, she moved to Petrograd to attend university, graduating as a teacher in 1921. Shortly afterwards, while in Kiev she experienced a plane flying over her for the first time. She was so impressed, she immediately decided she wanted to fly herself. She took up a job as librarian at the flying school in Kacha, Crimea. There she was trained by the Estonian Albert Poel, with whom she fell in love. They had planned to marry but Poel died when his plane crashed a couple of days before the wedding they had planned. After the disaster, those at the school agreed she could train as a military pilot at Yegoryevsk near Moscow. She was about to be dismissed by a commander but she successfully sought support from Mikhail Kalinin, the Soviet president. She first flew solo on 3 May 1924 and soon afterwards received her military licence. Although she was keen to become a fighter pilot, in view of her exceptional skills she was persuaded to stay at the school and become an instructor. During World War II, she trained many pilots, several of them women. She later spent 30 years as a schoolteacher and headmistress at Cholpon-Ata in Kyrgyzstan. On retirement, she returned to Moscow.

Life Elise Rosa (\\"Alice\\") Coblenz was born in Bingen, along the left (here south) bank of the Rhine, into a prosperous well established Jewish family. There were five children. Emilie, their, mother died while they were still small. Simon Zacharias Coblenz (1835 ‚Äì 1910), their father, was a wine grower/trader and leading member of the local business community who inflicted a strict rule based upbringing on his motherless children. Jewish religious holidays and precepts were to be unquestioningly respected. Details of her education are not known, but it is likely that she would have received the type of privately provided semi-education considered appropriate for girls of that time. In 1885 she married the Mannheim publisher Julius Bensheimer (1850 ‚Äì 1917) who was fourteen years her senior. It appears that just as soon as her two children were old enough to be left unattended for more than a couple of hours she turned her attention to social and public work with a particular focus on feminist politics and on poverty relief. Initially she was principally active in Mannheim, but after the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth century she was increasingly involved in the BDF at a national level. She became a member of the Progressive People's Party(\\"Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\\" / DVP) and, following the political realignments of 1918, of the German Democratic Party (\\"Deutsche Demokratische Partei\\" / DDP). Following the National Socialist take-over at the start of 1933, little more is heard of Alice Bensheimer. (She and her family were Jewish.) Her late husband's publishing business was \\"aryanized\\" and then, a couple of years later, subsumed into the Weidmannsche Buchhandlung books business. Bensheimer herself died in 1935 and was therefore spared the race-based persecution meted out to members of Mannheim's Jewish mercantile community who had previously been particularly well integrated into the city's middle-class. Family Julius Bensheimer, Alice's husband, was a well-known local politician in Mannheim and a publisher who produced, among other publications, the left-liberal Neue Badische Landeszeitung (regional newspaper). Ernst Bensheimer, the couple's son, qualified as a lawyer but died young in 1923.Paulina Brunner: Julius (1850‚Äì1917) und Alice Bensheimer (1864‚Äì1935) ‚Äì F√∂rderer der Emazipation von Juden und Frauen. In: Wilhelm Kreutz / Volker von Offenburg (Hgg.): J√ºdische Sch√ºler des Vereinigten Gro√üherzoglichen Lyzeums ‚Äì Karl-Friedrich Gymnasiums Mannheim, Mannheim: Wellh√∂fer 2014 (Schriftenreihe des Karl-Friedrich- Gymnasiums Mannheim in Kooperation mit dem Stadtarchiv Mannheim ‚Äì Institut f√ºr Stadtgeschichte; 2), , pp. 51‚Äì62. One of her younger sisters was the poet Ida Dehmel. Works In 1896 Bensheimer set up the \\"Caritas\\" women's organisation which undertook social work in the local Jewish communities, providing support for widows and orphans and creating otherwise unavailable education opportunities to the latter. \\"Caritas\\" was administered and organised as a partner organisation of the \\"August-Lamey-Loge\\", a charitable institution set up by her husband at around the same time. It is likely that in 1897 Bensheimer was a founder member of the Mannheim \\"Vereinsabteilung des Vereins Frauenbildung ‚Äì Frauenstudium\\", concerned with education for girls and established that year by her friend and fellow feminist activist Julie Bassermann. The national umbrella association was particularly active across southern Germany at this time, supporting the opening of new secondary schools and university level institutions for girls. Bensheimer's social and political interests had broadened by 1899 when she became a member of the municipal office of the Poverty and Youth Commission, working for poverty relief. In 1904 or 1905 she moved from the municipal to the national scene when she was appointed to the office of secretary with the executive of the BDF. She remained in the post till 1931, while at the same time working as editor for the BDF newsletter. Despite her national role in the BDF, she continued to be active in poverty relief in Mannheim, retaining membership of various welfare related local organisations and initiatives, and as a member of the Baden Women's Association (\\"Badischer Frauenverein\\"). During the First World War, which erupted at the end of July 1914, she took over leadership of the previously prosperous city's \\"Centre for War Welfare\\" (\\"Zentrale f√ºr Kriegsf√ºrsorge\\"). After the war and the ensuing revolutionary events that followed, in 1922 she founded and thereafter, through the so-called \\"Weimar years\\" till 1933, headed up, the \\"Mannheimer Notgesellschaft\\" which was a drawing together of associations committed to public welfare and poverty relief in a city where, thanks to the disastrous war, unsupported widows and orphans were now commonplace. She also sustained her support for various other local projects: she was involved in 1916 with the foundation by the Mannheim \\"Verein Frauenbildung ‚Äì Frauenstudium\\" in 1916 of the \\"Social Women's School for the Training of Care givers and Related Female Professions\\" (\\"Soziale Frauenschule....\\" also known sometimes simply as the \\"Welfare School / \\"Wohlfahrtsschule\\"), one of the first institutions of its kind in Germany. Elisabeth Altmann-Gottheiner, herself a teacher, who taught at the city's Commercial Academy, was installed as executive-chair of the administrative board at the new school, while Marie Bernays was appointed to the headship. Within and on behalf of the women's movement Alice Bensheimer became an intensive networker, happy to work together with government agencies through the Baden Women's Association (\\"Badischer Frauenverein\\") or indeed with the social-democratic women's movement at a time when, for a wife and daughter of the Mannheim middle-class establishment, Clara Zetkin and the other Social- democratic feminists would conventionally have been considered far outside the political mainstream. Bensheimer was convinced that the shared interests of women were far above and outside the world of mere party politics, and she called for greater female involvement in social issues and in schools policy. That was the context in which she was also an early advocate of women's suffrage.

Ruknuddin's name is associated with the propagation of Islam in Rajnagar. In 1315, he joined Shah Kamal Quhafa who was travelling to the Sylhet region to meet Shah Jalal and reunite with his father, Khwaja Burhanuddin Ketan. Life Ruknuddin was born in Baghdad in the 13th century. He joined his father, Alauddin, and his brothers, Bahauddin and Shah Tajuddin in accompanying Shah Kamal Quhafa in his quest to meet Shah Jalal and reunite with his father, Burhanuddin Ketan. In 1315, they reached Sylhet and spent some time as a murid of Shah Jalal in Dargah Mahalla. In June 1315, Jalal then ordered Shah Kamal Quhafa and his 12 dervishes to travel to north-western Taraf and propagate the religion there. The 13 men, as well as Kamal's wife, then set off from Sheikh Ghat along the Surma River in three small bajras known as pangshi (or panshi). The area which they resided in was originally a cluster of islands in body of water called Ratnang. It came to be known as Shaharpara (the neighbourhood of Shahs), on the banks of the Ratna river.Dr G Saklayen, Bangladesh Sufi Sadhak Ruknuddin later moved to Kadamhata where he spent the rest of his life preaching. Kadamhata was originally known as Kadamatka, meaning where the footsteps stopped. It is named after Ruknuddin (where his journeying ends). Ruknuddin then established an eidgah in Kadamhata and it would attract many people due to Ruknuddin himself being the imam. Death and legacy It is unclear how and what year he died, but he is buried in a mazar in Kadamhata, on Kulaura Road (N208) in Rajnagar Upazila. The mazar is close to the Kadamhata Bazar Jame Masjid and Ruknuddin's own eidgah. His urs take place on 13 February, which is considered his death date.

She was eventually declared a total loss, and is scheduled to be removed as scrap. Design Golden Ray was built by Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in Ulsan, South Korea. Her keel was laid on 23 December 2015, and she was launched on 26 August 2016. She was delivered from the builder on 12 May 2017, and at the time of her capsizing was owned and operated by Hyundai Glovis. Golden Ray measured 71,118 gross tons and 20,995 deadweight tons, and was long, with a beam of . She was powered by a single diesel engine that gave her a service speed of via a single propeller, and had a capacity of up to 7,400 cars. Capsizing On Saturday, September 8, 2019, Golden Ray capsized within Port of Brunswick harbour, shortly after unberthing and proceeding towards Port of Baltimore. The ship departed the dock in Brunswick shortly after midnight and had traveled only 23 minutes when it started to list. The serious listing caused the immediate port closure. All 23 crewmen on board as well as an American maritime pilot survived, including three engineers who were in the ship's engine room at the time of the incident. There was a rescue mission by United States Coast Guard to find 4 of the 23 crew members that went missing. All were eventually rescued and appeared to be in good medical condition. The vessel was carrying brand new Kia and Hyundai cars manufactured in Mexico, and vehicles made by other companies for delivery to the Middle East. The incident was mentioned as related to a sudden loss of stability possibly due to cargo stowage and incorrect water ballasting. A Hyundai Glovis executive told the news media that \\"there was some kind of an internal fire that could not be controlled and then it capsized\\". A fire had delayed the rescue of the last crew member. The National Transportation Safety Board agreed to assist in the investigation of the cause of the incident with two investigators assigned to the case.

The discharge could have been limited to a small amount, but the oil and chemicals could have also washed into marshland and seeped into the sediment. Concern was also expressed about a new wave of contaminants from the capsized ship when the ship is cut up for salvage. Oil coated grass and floating tarballs were observed around St. Simon's Sound and St. Simon's Island. Salvage The ship has 24 fuel tanks, and all were almost full when she capsized. By 27 September, two of them had been pumped out and vents on the others were plugged. had been pumped out, of a total of believed to be on board. The port continued to operate through the salvage process, with some delays. The salvage operation is expected to take several months, and a team was sent to Chile to examine her sister ship, to better understand the internal layout. There are twelve tanks near the engine room and twelve elsewhere on the ship. The salvage crews are monitoring for any pollution caused by leaks. In October 2019, due to the fire, saltwater corrosion, and salvage costs, the Golden Ray was declared a total loss, and it was announced that the ship would be cut up in place and scrapped. Insurance losses on the ship are estimated at $70 - 80 million, and $80 million in its contents. The salvage work will be done by T&T; Salvage utilizing the Versabar VB-10,000 (ship) Heavy Lift Vessel.

The 1st and 2nd Armies invaded the southern part, while the Romanian North Army invaded the northeastern part. Unlike the 1st and 2nd Armies - which had to contend with a German-led counter-offensive (First Battle of Petrozs√©ny, Battle of Brass√≥) - the North Army faced primarily Austro-Hungarian forces, and as such its campaign hardly had any major battles. After conquering three Hungarian urban districts (including two county capitals), the undefeated North Army was ordered to withdraw due to events outside its control, after inflicting heavier losses than those it had incurred. Background The North Army had to cross the greatest distance to accomplish its mission, and as such it had a greater number of soldiers than either of the two other Romanian armies invading Transylvania. Commanding the North Army was Constantin Prezan, a general who had studied in France.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 26-27 Prezan was, however, widely regarded as more of a courtier than a serious military officer. Fortunately for the Romanians, his operations officer was Captain Ion Antonescu, a \\"talented if prickly\\" individual.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 320 Such was the influence of Captain Antonescu that, in his memoirs, General Alexandru Averescu used the formula \\"Prezan (Antonescu)\\" to denote Prezan's plans and actions.Larry Watts, Eastern European Monographs, 1993, Romanian Cassandra, p. 43 Initially, the Romanian North Army was opposed by a single Austro-Hungarian infantry division, the 61st. Part of General Arthur Arz von Straussenburg's 1st Army, it was weak and battered during battles against the Russians, the division amounting to only 3,555 men.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 27 Romanian offensive Romanian map showing the maximum advance of the Romanian North Army into Transylvania, using a blue line which passes, from South to North, to the west of Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r (on the map, Cristurul secui), Parajd (on the map, Paraid) and Lib√°nfalva (on the map, IbƒÉne»ôti)The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 230 The fragile Austro-Hungarian defenses faltered at the first push of the Romanian covering forces. Two regiments from the 15th Brigade of the 8th Division seized K√©zdiv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Secuiesc) on 29 August, the Romanians arriving in time to destroy the last train leaving the town. The Austro-Hungarians did manage to blow up a critical railroad viaduct near the border. Although the Romanians had prepared a special commando unit under Lieutenant Ilie »òteflea to cross the border three hours before the start of the invasion and secure the viaduct, the 14th Romanian Infantry Regiment jumped the gun and crossed the border along with the commandos. Having lost the element of surprise, the Romanians alerted the Austro-Hungarians, who blew up the railroad viaduct. In early September, the Romanians reached Cs√≠kszereda (Miercurea Ciuc), capital of Csik County. There, they temporarily halted their offensive and dug in on the east side of the Olt River. Further to the north, the Austro-Hungarians gave up B√©lbor (Bilbor) after running out of ammunition. One brigade kept the Romanians largely east of Borsz√©k (Borsec) while gendarmes held their own in the Kelemen (CƒÉlimani) Mountains. For the most part, however, Austro-Hungarian soldiers along the border limped towards the Transylvanian interior, accompanied by hordes of German and Hungarian refugees.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 28-29 For instance, over two thirds of the population of Cs√≠kszereda left the town.David Cooper, Yale University Press, Apr 28, 2015, B√©la Bart√≥k, p. 151 However, as events would unfold, such behavior would prove exaggerated. In many places, the ethnic-Hungarian civilian population attacked small scattered groups of Romanian soldiers. A fact not merely admitted, but praised in the Hungarian press of the time, such as the newspaper Pesti Napl√≥. In response, the Romanians nowhere took to reprisals, beyond fighting and disarming the civilians who put up active resistance. Wherever the Romanian Army advanced, proclamations were published promising safety and protection to all inhabitants, regardless of nationality. No damage was done by the Romanian armies to the property of civilians, regardless if said property belonged to ethnic-Hungarians (Sz√©kelys) or ethnic-Germans (Transylvanian Saxons).The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 234 On 8 September, the Romanians announced themselves in possession of Marosh√©v√≠z (Topli»õa), Cs√≠kp√°lfalva (Delni»õa) and Gyergy√≥szentmikl√≥s (Gheorgheni).Leonard Wood, Austin Melvin Knight, Frederick Palmer, Frank Herbert Simonds, Arthur Brown Ruhl, P.

The 7th Division, after pushing aside the 19th Honv√©d Brigade, continued its advance through the mountains towards Sz√©kelyudvarhely (Odorheiu Secuiesc). Having shouldered aside the 16th Honv√©d Brigade at Gyergy√≥szentmikl√≥s, the 14th Division reached the eastern edges of the salt-mining town of Parajd (Praid) on 11 September. On 13 September, the Romanians had driven the 1st Landsturm Cavalry Brigade from the heights near Praid. By late September, the I Reserve Corps under the command of the German General Curt von Morgen, had joined the Austro-Hungarians in their fight against the Romanian North Army. The Corps succeeded in slowing the Romanians down.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 53, 56 and 99 Von Morgen's I Reserve Corps comprised two infantry divisions: the 89th German and the 71st Austro-Hungarian.Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916‚Äì17, p. 353 On 28 September, the Romanian North Army renewed its offensive. Despite stubborn Austro-Hungarian resistance, it continued to inch forward throughout the following week, advancing to within six miles of Sz√°szr√©gen (Reghin) and securing the heights above Parajd by early October. In early October, the Romanian General Staff issued orders for the retreat of the North Army, due to the events unfolding in the region of Dobruja. General Arz ordered his tired forces to pursue the Romanians, but the exhausted Austro- Hungarians moved slowly, giving the Romanians an uncontested run to the border, where they settled into defensive positions prepared before the war.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 115 and 125 The pace of the pursuit is exemplified by the situation of Sz√©kelyudvarhely. This town, capital of Udvarhely County, was taken by the Romanians on 21 September. It was retaken by the Austro-Hungarians on 8 October, however the Romanians were already gone.Funk & Wagnalls, 1916, The Literary Digest, Volume 53, Part 2, p. 924 Having begun its retreat on 5 October, the Romanian North Army had already evacuated the town on the 7th, one day before the Austro-Hungarians arrived. By 14 October, the North Army had almost everywhere fallen back to the Romanian border.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 233 Cs√≠kszereda was evacuated by the Romanians on 11 October.Leonard Wood, Austin Melvin Knight, Frederick Palmer, Frank Herbert Simonds, Arthur Brown Ruhl, P. F.

Thus, the line of the North Army's furthest advance was drawn through Lib√°nfalva (IbƒÉne»ôti), west of Parajd (Praid) and west of Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r (Cristuru Secuiesc).The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 230 The town of K√©zdiv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Secuiesc) was the Transylvanian urban settlement that was held by the Romanians during the Battle of Transylvania for the longest. The Romanian 15th Brigade of the 8th Division of the Romanian North Army took K√©zdiv√°s√°rhely (T√¢rgu Secuiesc) on 29 August.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, Oct 23, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 28 Austrian military maps reveal that the town remained in Romanian hands well into October. On 8 and 9 October, as the Battle of Brass√≥ was drawing to a close, two Romanian units retreated from the north and northwest and formed a defensive perimeter around K√©zdiv√°s√°rhely. As of 14 October, most of the Romanian North Army's positions had fallen back towards the Romanian border, with the exception of K√©zdiv√°s√°rhely. As late as that day, the town was still firmly in Romanian hands, with Romanian positions to both the north and the south of it.Edmund Glaise-Horstenau, √ñsterreich-Ungarns letzter Krieg 1914 ‚Äì 1918. Vol. 5: Das Kriegsjahr 1916 ; 2 ; Beil, Verl. der Milit√§rwiss. Mitteilungen, Wien, 1932 (map of the area of operations) It is not known when exactly was the town retaken by the Central Powers, but the date could only be 15 or 16 October, because on the latter date, the Battle of Transylvania ended: by 16 October, the Romanians had been driven back all along the line and Transylvania had been cleared.United publishers of Canada, limited, 1920, Canada in the Great World War: The turn of the tide, p. 395Frank Moore Colby, Allen Leon Churchill, Herbert Treadwell Wade, Frank H.

During late September - early October, the North Army captured a further 511 prisoners and 4 machine guns in the mountains, along with 1,242 further prisoners during an offensive beyond Sz√©kelykereszt√∫r (Cristuru Secuiesc). The North Army carried out its retreat in the best order and suffered only negligible losses.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, pp. 210, 230 and 233 The last days of the operation were marked by fighting at the mountain passes along the border. Transylvania was cleared of Romanian forces by 16 October.United publishers of Canada, limited, 1920, Canada in the Great World War: The turn of the tide, p. 395Frank Moore Colby, Allen Leon Churchill, Herbert Treadwell Wade, Frank H. Vizetelly, Dodd, Mead and Company, 1917, The New International Year Book, p. 806 Violent fighting began in the Uz and Oituz Passes on 14 October. Between 13 and 15 October, the Austro-Hungarians conquered Palanca.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 445 =Battle of the Kelemen Mountains= A local setback for the Romanians, this low-scale engagement is the only battle during the Romanian North Army's offensive into Transylvania for which the exact casualties on both sides are known. It is questionable why the area of the Kelemen Mountains was given so much attention by the Austro-Hungarian command. The area had no roads of note, and the Romanians were not going to cross the mountains with any units other than the smallest ones. General Arz sent the VII Battalion of the 72nd Division, along with 4 machine guns to the area. The battalion was temporarily made part of the 73rd Honv√©d Brigade of the I Army Corps of the 7th Army. The 6/9 Mountain artillery battery was subsequently attached to the VII Battalion, and the reinforced unit was sent to engage the Romanians alongside local gendarmes. The Romanians had already driven the gendarmes from Pietrosz (Pietrosu). The Austro-Hungarians attacked on 17 September, and initially made good progress, until the 27th Company ran into a trap and lost 44 of its men as prisoners. Several days of intense fighting followed, the Romanians being driven back to the east. The Romanians lost 136 killed and 55 prisoners, while the Austro- Hungarians lost 10 killed, 63 wounded and 82 missing. On 9 October, the VII Battalion was relieved by a Honv√©d regiment from the XI Corps, the battalion rejoining its parent division, the 72nd.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, pp. 54-55 Aftermath After 14 October, when the fighting in the Uz and Oituz Passes commenced, the Romanians overall held their ground, inflicting reverses and serious losses. After conquering Palanca between 13 and 15 October, the Austro-Hungarians were intercepted at AgƒÉ»ô on 18 October, where they were forced to hastily retreat. The Romanians captured almost 1,000 prisoners, 12 guns and numerous machine guns. By 26 October, the Austro- Hungarians had gained very little territory across the Romanian border while sustaining very heavy losses.The Times, 1917, The Times History and Encyclopaedia of the War, Volume 11, p. 445  References  Category:Battles of the Eastern Front (World War I) Category:Battles of World War I involving Romania Category:Battles of World War I involving Austria-Hungary Category:Battles of World War I involving Germany Category:Conflicts in 1916 Category:1916 in Romania ","title":"Northern front of the Battle of Transylvania"},{"id":"61923051","text":"Gambi is a surname.

History The fort is believed to date from the 1st millennium AD, some placing it around the 9th century. Its rectilinear shape and unusual structure has led to the belief that it is later than the other Aran Islands forts like D√∫n Conor, and perhaps contemporary with D√∫n Formna on Inisheer. The name D√∫n Mur is believed to have the same derivation as the Cliffs of Moher, which are named after an old promontory fort called Moher, which once stood on Hag's Head. The name D√∫n Fearbha√≠ takes its name from the surrounding area An Fhearbach, \\"abounding in cattle.\\" Description A stone ringfort (cashel) shaped like a square with rounded corners; it contains two walls and one terrace built on a steep incline, and also four sets of internal stairs. The walls are up to high and up to thick, and measure about by internally. There is a single entrance in the east, wide. O‚ÄôDriscoll wrote, \\"A thick wall would have been necessary for larger, higher walls, resulting in excessive labour and resource costs. This was partly alleviated by terracing the walls, reducing the amount of material used. Terracing of the inner face and incorporation of steps allowed access to the top of the wall, permitting occupants expansive visibility of the immediate environs as well as a strategic advantage over approaching attackers. The vertical walls that met attackers or visitors would have been an impressive barrier that provided practical defence for the occupants, as well status.\\"https://www.ria.ie/sites/default/files/dwhs_report_2016_odriscoll_preliminary_report_for_web_3_0.pdf References Category:Aran Islands Category:National Monuments in County Galway Category:Archaeological sites in County Galway ","title":"D√∫n Fearbha√≠"},{"id":"61923147","text":"An outron is a nucleotide sequence at the 5' end of the primary transcript of a gene that is removed by a special form of RNA splicing during maturation of the final RNA product. Whereas intron sequences are located inside the gene, outron sequences lie outside the gene.  Characteristics  The outron is an intron-like sequence possessing similar characteristics such as the G+C content and a splice acceptor site that is the signal for trans-splicing. Such a trans-splice site is essentially defined as an acceptor (3') splice site without an upstream donor (5') splice site. In eukaryotes such as euglenozoans, dinoflagellates, sponges, nematodes, cnidarians, ctenophores, flatworms, crustaceans, chaetognaths, rotifers, and tunicates, the length of spliced leader (SL) outrons range from 30 to 102 nucleotides (nt), with the SL exon length ranging from 16 to 51 nt, and the full SL RNA length ranging from 46 to 141 nt.  Processing  In standard cis-splicing, the donor splice site in upstream position is required together with an acceptor site located on downstream position on the same pre-RNA molecule. By contrast, the SL trans- splicing relies on a 3' acceptor splice site on the outron, and a 5' donor splice site (GU dinucleotide) located on a separate RNA molecule, the SL RNA. Moreover, the outron of the premature mRNA contains a branchpoint adenosine ‚Äî followed by a downstream polypyrimidine tract ‚Äî which interacts with the intron-like portion of the SL RNA to form a 'Y' branched byproduct, reminiscent of the lasso structure formed during intron splicing. Nuclear machinery then resolves this 'Y' branching structure by trans-splicing the SL RNA sequence to the 3‚Ä≤ trans-splice acceptor site (AG dinucleotide) of the pre-mRNA. When outrons are processed, the SL exon is trans-spliced to distinct, unpaired, downstream acceptor sites adjacent to each open reading frame of the polycistronic pre-mRNA, leading to distinct mature capped transcripts.

The 299th episode overall of the series, it premiered on Comedy Central in the United States on October 2, 2019. The episode parodies media censorship in China, and the manner in which the American entertainment industry purposefully compromises its productions to avoid it. As a result of the episode's criticism of its practices, the Chinese government banned the series entirely in the country, a move which in turn drew criticism from the creators of the show. Plot As fourth grader Stan Marsh composes a song for his new death metal band, Crimson Dawn, his father Randy announces to the family that he plans to travel to China to expand the family's Tegridy Farms marijuana business. Upon boarding a plane to China, Randy sees many other people, including NBA players and characters belonging to Disney, are also going there to expand their businesses. He is arrested in China when marijuana is discovered in his luggage. Randy is imprisoned where he witnesses the practice of summary execution, and is subjected to re-education through labor, torture, and Communist Party re- education. During a Crimson Dawn rehearsal, the band is visited by a music producer who wants to make a biographical film of the band, as traditional music resources such as albums and tours are no longer profitable. Stan, who desperately wants to leave his farm home, is thrilled. When the film's structure is discussed, the bandmates learn that certain aspects of their lives will have to be edited out in order to make the film marketable in China due to their censorship of the media. In prison, Randy meets fellow prisoners Winnie the Pooh and Piglet, who are there because they were banned in China after Internet memes comparing Xi Jinping to Disney's version of Pooh became popular. When Randy is brought before a court, he criticizes the Chinese government for the way it treats its prisoners, accusing them of lacking \\"tegridy\\" (his term for integrity). When Mickey Mouse learns of Randy's criticism, he angrily confronts Randy over the Chinese business he is losing because of it, but Randy holds firm on his beliefs that business should not be conducted on the basis of intimidation, and expresses his marijuana import idea to him. When Mickey and Randy make their case to the Chinese officials, their offer is rejected, which Mickey attributes to the Winnie the Pooh matter. Randy responds by using honey to lure Pooh to a secluded alley and strangling him to death as Piglet watches in horror. During filming on the Crimson Dawn movie, the censorship continues to the point that Chinese officials are on set to approve its content. The producer asks Stan to rewrite the script \\"from his heart\\", but Stan is frustrated by a Chinese censor standing over his shoulder as he writes in his bedroom, erasing passages he disapproves of. Later with his bandmates, Stan realizes that the only film that will even be accepted in China is something \\"vanilla and cheesy\\". Stan's best friend, Kyle Broflovski, disembarks from a bus with Eric Cartman following their stay in an ICE detention center in the previous episode. The friends' reunion inspires Stan to reform his previous band Fingerbang for a new biopic, but he changes his mind during filming, saying that no matter how badly he wishes to leave the farm, he cannot bring himself to compromise for China, and commenting that anyone who does is worthless. Meanwhile, Tegridy Weed has become legal in China. As a dump truck unloads a load of cash at the farm during a family meal, Stan asks Randy why he is covered in honey and blood. When Randy admits that he murdered Pooh, Stan calmly leaves the table to write another song about his father. Reception and controversy =Reception= John Hugar with The A.V. Club gave the episode a grade of \\"B\\", calling it \\"strong.\\" He compared Parker and Stone's decision to critique the role that the Chinese government plays in the American entertainment industry to past instances in which they displayed similar boldness in their choice of target, as when they commented on media depictions of the prophet Muhammad in past episodes. Hugar thought the arrest Randy suffers as a result of his failure to research marijuana laws in China was among the series' funniest moments. He also lauded the reveal of Crimson Dawn's music and the use of Mickey Mouse, both to defuse tense scenes and as a key part of the story's resolution. Forbes contributor Dani Di Placido said the episode was \\"hilarious, and depressingly insightful,\\" and pointed to the contrast between Stan's decision and Randy's choice to put profit above principle as the best example of that. Joe Matar, writing in Den of Geek, was less favorable, giving the episode a rating of 2 out of 5 stars; he thought that Trey Parker's tying Stan and Randy's relationship issues to the episode's greater ethical questions was intelligent writing, but thought the episode overall was marred by \\"lazy plotting and tired shock humor.\\" Matthew Rozsa of Salon felt the episode expressed valid criticism about the manner in which the American entertainment industry compromises itself to suit China's government, and enjoyed the way in which it illustrated this point. Jahara Matisek, a professor at the US Air Force Academy, praised the episode in an article for the Modern War Institute, describing the importance of South Park demarcating an American shift in information and political warfare against China. Matisek contended that the now banned-in-China episode \\"not only lays bare the conflict of values, but also itself serves as a way of advancing American interests and soft power in an era of China increasingly trying to impose an authoritarian vision on its region and world.\\" =Chinese ban= In response to the episode's criticism of the Chinese government, South Park has been entirely banned in China, including on its streaming services and social media platforms. In October 2019, insiders told Bloomberg that Apple, which has a significant portion of its users and manufacturers in China, was reportedly unlikely to bid for the streaming rights of the series due to the China ban. In response to the criticisms and the subsequent ban of their show in China, South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker sent out a fake apology stating, \\"Like the NBA, we welcome Chinese censors into our homes and into our hearts. We too love money more than freedom and democracy. Xi doesn‚Äôt look just like Winnie the Pooh at all. Tune into our 300th episode this Wednesday at 10! Long live the Great Communist Party of China! May this autumn‚Äôs sorghum harvest be bountiful! We good now China?\\" This was a reference to a then- ongoing controversy surrounding the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Daryl Morey's comments regarding the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. On the night of October 8, 2019, the episode was screened on a busy street in Hong Kong's Sham Shui Po District as a form of protest.

Revolt against Spain =Founding of the province= In 1782, Governor-General Jos√© Basco y Vargas sent an expedition in Batanes island and formally subjects the Ivatan people under the Spanish King. Spanish rule was then established in Batanes island on June 26, 1783, and Joseph Huelva y Melgarejo as the first governor of the islandand the new province was named Provincia de la Concepcion. Aman Dangat continues to govern his people as a chieftain as per indigenous custom laws. =Resistance to policies= For easier administration of the people, the villagers of Sabtang and Vuhus were then transferred in San Vicente and San Felix in the town of Ivana in 1785 and it was at this year Aman Dangat first got into trouble with the Spanish authorities as he asked why he should follow Spanish policies. He defied the Spanish policies and initially it was a show of force as he probed the weaknesses and strength of the Spanish authorities. In 1789, the third governor of Batanes Joaquin del Castillo decreed that the Ivatans should live in the newly laid towns, change their costumes and customs and adopt the Spanish government system and obey the law by means of obedience to the governor as king's representative.Gonz√°lez Alonzo, Fr. Julio, O.P. (1966). \\"The Batanes Islands\\", in Acta Manilana, Manila: University of Santo Tomas Research Center He felt that the decree has offended him as he was the chieftain of Malakdang. He and about 150 men surrounded the mission house of Dominican priest Fr. Bartolome Artiguez demanding to know if the governor has a plan to arrest him and the priest assured that there was no such plan. He also asked Governor del Castillo and the governor assured him that there was no such plan and told him that he should not hesitate to appeal to the governor if he felt unfairly treated in any way . =Uprising and death= In 1791, non-Ivatan Filipinos working under Spanish government took from Aman Dangat's people supplies and timber without just compensation, he protested to the governor but instead, his men were chained. Under his leadership, he organized an uprising. Over a hundred men from Sabtang joined him in a revolt and seven government agents were killed.The Spanish authorities have overpowered Aman Dangat's force and were outnumbered by the stronger Spanish forces. Most of his men were killed and convicted. Aman Dangat, a powerful chieftain and a leader fighting for the rights and freedom of the natives, was hanged in public in September 1791 in the town of Basco, Batanes. Before his execution, he was baptized and was named Buenaventura. The people of Sabtang was then immediately ordered to settle in San Vicente and San Felix in the town of Ivana in Batan Island.

Biography Son of Giovanni Compagnoni and Domenica Ettorri, he was born on 3 March 1754 into one of the best families of the local patriciate in Lugo. The parents lived in Casa Cavadini, on the street De 'Brozzi (San Vitale) not far from the Sanctuary of the Madonna del Mulino.Walter Berti, Lugo nel 900. Una storia di Lugo nel XX secolo, Walberti, Lugo 2005, p. 107. Giuseppe was sent to study as a child, distinguishing himself in philosophy and theology and graduating cum laude in 1778 at the college of Dominicans in the territory. He was urged by the family to take the vows.Marcello Savini, Un abate \\"libertino\\". Le Memorie autobiografiche e altri scritti di Giuseppe Compagnoni, Lugo, Banca di Romagna, 1988. After ordination to the priesthood, Compagnoni was a candidate for the canonical chapter of the Collegiate Lughese, but was rejected. After a few years of priesthood, he left the cassock.Don Mino Martelli, Storia di Lugo di Romagna in chiave francescana, Walberti, Lugo, 1984, p. 237. In 1781 Compagnoni published a Ragionamento parentetico addressed to the people of the various towns of Romagna affected by the earthquake of that year. It is probably his first printed work in Italian. In 1782 one of his poems, La Fiera di Sinigaglia o sia saggio sul commercio, signed with the pseudonym Ligofilo (a term he himself coined on the Greek assonance, \\"lover of reading\\") was reviewed by the Bologna magazine \\"Memorie Enciclopediche\\", a bibliographic information journal created the previous year. Compagnoni came into contact with the director, the lawyer Giovanni Ristori, and in a short time he started an external collaboration with the newspaper. The magazine contained (seven pages out of eight) reviews of works in Italian just published. Ristori appreciated the encyclopedic culture of the Lughese; just as he immediately liked Compagnoni's reviews, written with an ironic and sharp style at the same time. From 1784 Compagnoni appeared in the list of the fixed collaborators of \\"Memorie\\", with the responsibility of the reviews in the field of \\"metaphysics\\". In 1785 he found the opportunity to leave his native Lugo, where he could no longer find strong stimuli. In May, Ristori asked him to replace it temporarily as head of the newspaper. The proposal was accepted. In Bologna Compagnoni came into contact with important personalities and men of letters of the city. He continued to work hard at the newspaper, which in that same year had changed its name to \\"Giornale Enciclopedico\\". His period of supply to the direction ended at the end of June 1786, when he returned the task to Ristori. Later he sought a new job suited to his social status. He moved to Ferrara, where he entered service as secretary of the Bentivoglio d'Aragona family (October 1786). In 1787 Ristori, tired of the continuous disputes with the pontifical censorship, closed the newspaper and moved to the Republic of Venice. Shortly afterwards also Compagnoni arrived in the capital of the Serenissima, always in the wake of the Bentivoglio family. He collaborated with Il Giornalista veneto, then went on to direct Notizie del mondo (1789‚Äì1794), published by the publisher Antonio Graziosi. It was his first owner. In cassock Compagnoni taught as a repeater in the after-school to the College of the Villa dei Bentivoglio, called \\"Viola\\". Here he met the patriots Giovanni Battista De Rolandis and Luigi Zamboni who then organized a revolt starring the Italian tricolor cockade. During the decade of his stay in the lagoon city ‚Äì fundamental for his intellectual growth ‚Äì he knew several prominent personalities, such as Vincenzo Dandolo (with whom he started a partnership that lasted until the death of the Venetian intellectual, in the 1920s) , Antonio Fortunato Stella and Count Alessandro Pepoli, at whose printing house Mercury was printed. In 1794 Compagnoni abjured the priestly vows in protest against the torture inflicted by the Inquisition Court on the detainees. In Venice he founded his own newspaper, the monthly Mercurio d'Italia (January 1796). The magazine had both a historical-political aspect and a scientific- literary guise. In fact, two versions came out (both about seventy pages), the Mercurio d'Italia storico-politico and the Mercurio d'Italia storico- letterario.B. Rosada, La giovinezza di Niccol√≤ Ugo Foscolo, Padova, Antenore, 1992, p. 66; M. Berengo (a cura di), Giornali veneziani del Settecento, Milano, Feltrinelli, 1962, p. LXI. In October 1796, on the wave of the upheavals that the peninsula were crossing after the French invasion, he left Venice for Ferrara. Embraced Enlightenment ideas, he was general secretary of the Cispadane Republic. Elected to the Congress of Reggio Emilia, he presented numerous theses, including some concerning taxes and education. On 7 January 1797 he proposed for the first time the adoption of a green, white and red national flag in the 14th session of the Cispadan congress which took place in a hall of the city's town hall, called the \\"centumvirate congress hall\\" and later renamed Sala del Tricolore. The adoption decree states: The eighteenth- century Sala del Tricolore, which later became the council hall of the municipality of Reggio Emilia, where the Italian flag was born The congress's decision to adopt a green, white and red tricolor flag was then also greeted by a jubilant atmosphere, so much was the enthusiasm of the delegates, and by bursts of applause. For the first time, the city of ducal states for centuries enemies, they identify themselves as one people and a common identity symbol: the tricolor flag. For the first time the Italian flag officially became the national flag of a sovereign state, disengaging itself from the local military and civic meaning: with this adoption the Italian flag therefore assumed an important political value. Compagnoni also gave an important speech on the need to separate civil and ecclesiastical power on the following 25 January. In the same year, the Cispadan administration entrusted him, at the University of Ferrara, with the first chair in constitutional law in Europe. Following the merger between the Cispadana and the Cisalpina into a single entity, Compagnoni moved to Milan, where he held various institutional offices ‚Äì first deputy and then member of the Cassation ‚Äì until the Austrians returned in 1799. In the Lombard capital he founded a new newspaper, the Monitore Cisalpino (May 1798). Compagnoni obtained a public grant of 2,000 lire.Renzo De Felice, Il triennio giacobino in Italia (1796‚Äì1799), Bonacci, Roma, 1990, p. 136. His newspaper was intended to spread the thought of the Directory in Italy. Within the first year of life Compagnoni sold the head to Count Luigi Bossi and entered service as an official of the Cisalpine administration. Sheltered in Paris due to the Austro-Russian invasion led by General Alexander Suvorov (1799), he returned to the Lombard capital immediately after the French victory at Battle of Marengo (1800). He became a career official in the Cisalpine, then became the Italian Republic and later the Kingdom of Italy, he held ‚Äì among others ‚Äì the position of secretary of the Council of State. On the initiative of Bonaparte, he was awarded the Iron Crown, the highest civil honor. At the fall of Napoleon (1814), Compagnoni had to leave the state offices assumed during the Kingdom of Italy. He devoted himself to the activity of scholar and polygraph, with which he supplemented the pension check (the Habsburg administration, however, did not recognize him the pensions he was entitled to for the positions he held in the previous fifteen years). He collaborated mainly with the printers Antonio Fortunato Stella and Giambattista Sonzogno. Despite some frictions with the new regime, he also collaborated with pro-Austrian magazines, such as the \\"Biblioteca Italiana\\", while never denying his political belief. He lived the rest of his life in Milan, which became his adopted homeland, where he died on 29 December 1833.

It is a species usually found on mountain slopes.  Diagnostic characters  Key diagnostic characters of S. pictus are its relatively firm and thick bracts that surrounding the flower clusters (spikes). These bracts are often yellow-brown in colour in young plants and they envelop the spikes. In addition, the leaf sheaths and part of the flowering stems are usually sticky. The prominent bracts surrounding the spikes combined with the sticky (viscous) leaf bases distinguish S. pictus from other Southern African Schoenus species. Similar to other sedges, plants in this group are very difficult to identify. It appears that part of this problem is caused by the tendency of the southern African Schoenus to form hybrids with each other. However, hybridization is yet to be observed in S. pictus. Schoenus_pictus- inflorescence.jpgFlowering head Spictus-spikelet.pdfSpikelet Spictus- nutlet.pdfNutlet  Taxonomy  Schoenus pictus is a species in family Cyperaceae, tribe Schoeneae. Other notable genera in tribe Schoeneae include Lepidosperma, Oreobolus, Costularia, Tetraria and Gahnia. The most closely related species to S. pictus are other southern African Schoenus species, specifically, species in the Schoenus compar - Schoenus pictus group. Southern African Schoenus were once classified as Tetraria; however, based on molecular and morphological differences, we now know that the two groups are evolutionary distinct. To ensure that this group of sedges is monophyletic (i.e. the genus only has closely related species), the southern African Tetraria were transferred into Schoenus. In the field, the southern African Schoenus can be distinguished from Tetraria species by their lack of stem leaves and the absence of reticulate sheaths at the bases of the flowering stems.  Distribution and ecology  Schoenus pictus grows throughout the western mountains of the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Most reports of this species are from high mountain slopes surrounded by fynbos vegetation, often from damp sites.

He joined the Operative Bleachers, Dyers and Finishers Association (the \\"Bolton Amalgamation\\"), soon becoming secretary of its local branch, then serving on its national executive. Oakes continued his education, with the Workers' Educational Association, and the National Council of Labour Colleges, and this inspired him to join the Independent Labour Party, and the co- operative movement. He won a seat on Lancaster City Council, representing the Labour Party, and also stood unsuccessfully in Royton in the 1935 UK general election, sponsored by his union. In 1936, the Bolton Amalgamation became part of the new National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers, with Oakes continuing to serve on the executive, then as president of the union in 1939/40. He resigned in 1941 to begin working for the Labour Department of the Co-operative Union, relocating to Manchester.

University Park (), is a public park in central Uppsala in Sweden, situated in the historical Fj√§rdingen district close to Uppsala Cathedral. The park was created in its present form following the completion of the centrally situated University Main Building on the site during the 1880s, and retains much of its original character today. Many historical sights surround the park, including the 19th century University building, S√∂dermanlands-Nerikes nation, Gustavianum, Ekerman House and the 18th-century Archbishop's Residence. Also situated next to the park is the modern Church of Sweden main administrative office building and the Fyrisbiografen cinema. Before the University Main Building stands the monument to Erik Gustaf Geijer (1783‚Äì1847), poet and historian, which was sculpted by John B√∂rjesson and erected in 1888. The six runestones displayed in the park were originally found in the city and its surrounding countryside.  History  The site of University Park was the site of the medieval Archbishops' Castle, demolished in the 16th century following the protestant reformation and the construction of the royal castle of Uppsala in the southern part of the city. Before the creation of the park, the ruins including the lower levels of a round tower were still visible, which is the origin of the nearby street name Rundelsgr√§nd. From the 17th to the 19th centuries the University's excercitia hall was situated here, where the upper-class students were able to practice riding, fencing, dancing and modern languages. The hall was situated approximately where the University Main Building is today, with a terraced garden surrounded by a fence.

He was canonized by Pope John Paul II on 21 May 2000Canonization (May 21, 2000) as one of 25 Martyrs of the Cristero War. David Galv√°n was born in GuadalajaraDavid Galv√°n Berm√∫dez, Jalisco, son of Jos√© Trinidad Galv√°n and Mariana Berm√∫dez. The latter would die when his son was three years old. Later, his father remarried and David was taken care of by his father, sisters, and stepmother Victoriana Medina. From a young age he had to help his father in the shoe shop. When he was fourteen, he entered the Saint Joseph of Guadalajara Seminary to attend high school, but he would leave in 1900 to return to work in the shoe shop. He would then ask for readmission two years later. Due to his low fidelity, the General Prefect Miguel de la Mora subjected him to rigorous tests for a year. But it was clear that David's personality had pacified and surprised his examiners by his dedication to mental prayer and his perseverance in enduring adversity. Finally, he was ordained on May 20, 1909 when he was 28 years old and, shortly thereafter, he was confirmed as superior of the same seminary. From his beginnings as a priest, he was characterized by helping the poor. Among the many positions he held within the seminary, he was a teacher of the diocesan seminary, being the chair for Latin, natural law, and sociology. He was also the founder and director of the seminary magazine \\"Voice of Breath\\", from December 1910 to 1912. In those same years, from 1909 to 1914, he was the chaplain of the Hospital of San Jos√© and the Orphanage of La Luz in Guadalajara. However, his work within the seminary was interrupted when the Archbishop of Guadalajara, Francisco Orozco y Jim√©nez, dissolved it following the arrest of 120 clerics. In 1914, while he was vicar of Am√°tit√°n, he helped a young girl who was persecuted by the militant Enrique Vera for denying him marriage because she was already married. This brought Father Galv√°n the enmity of the lieutenant, who became his executioner. He was apprehended by orders of the aforementioned captain. The arrest lacked substance, which led to Father Galv√°n regaining his freedom. On the Saturday of 30 January 1915, violent clashes between host Villistas and Carrancistas were recorded in Guadalajara. The priests David Galv√°n and Jos√© Mar√≠a Araiza prepared to help the dying and wounded. When they crossed the botanical garden, in front of the old San Miguel Hospital, they were intercepted by Enrique Vera, who ordered his immediate arrest and without prior trial, sentenced him to the death penalty. A timely pardon saved Father Araiza's life but Galv√°n would not suffer the same fate, as he was sent to Coronel Calder√≥n Street, next to the Bel√©n Cemetery. In front of the firing squad and without losing the fortitude, Father Galv√°n distributed the valuables he carried. He did not want to be blindfolded and in front of those responsible for executing it, he pointed calmly at his chest to receive the bullets.

After finishing his studies in 1885, he worked at the Novaja Alexandrija station (now Pu≈Çawy) and in 1887 began teaching at his alma mater in St. Petersburg. =Physicist and engineer= In 1890 Merczyng started lecturing on electrical engineering and telegraphy, and organized an electrotechnical laboratory. Since 1892 he was employed as an adjunct professor. He became an associate professor in 1896 and was granted full professorship in electrical engineering in 1904. He also taught for some time at the St. Petersburg Electrotechnical Institute. During his career as a professor, he supervised some of the first diploma theses on the subjects of electric power systems (tramway, railway, and hydropower) and electrification of rolling stock repair plants. Merczyng was the main initiator of Russian railways electrification plans and developed pioneering projects in this area: the St. Petersburg junction, the Transcaucasus railways (1911), and the Moscow junction (1912). He was a member of the engineering council of the Russian Ministry of Communication and a State Councillor. Some of his research dealt with hydraulics, in particular, the theory of fluid flow through pipelines, and was done in connection with the long-distance Baku-Batumi oil pipeline that was being built at the time. He also conducted comprehensive studies and experiments in the field of optics and light waves. Merczyng was an active member of the Polish colony in St. Petersburg and in 1883 founded (together with W≈Çadys≈Çaw Natanson) a semi-legal organization for Polish students, which after 1905 evolved into the legal Association of Polish Physicians and Naturalist (). He also belonged to the Management Board of Polish Higher Courses in St. Petersburg. =Historian and demographer= Merczyng's (Edward Czy≈Ñski's) map from the 1909 paper, 1912 reproduction. Merczyng took particular interest in the history of reformation in Poland, issues of demography and historical geography. He devoted himself to these disciplines mainly on holidays while frequenting libraries and archives both in the Russian Empire and Austrian Galicia. In 1887 he authored his \\"Ethnographical- Statistical Outline of the Numerical Strength and Distribution of the Polish Population\\" (), which was republished with changes in 1909. The new edition included significantly different data for the Russian Empire's territory ‚Äì the first version relied on church statistics, while the second repeated results of the 1897 Russian census. Merczyng was one of the pioneers of research on the history of Polish nontrinitarianism. His works on the Polish Reformation movement are valued mainly due to the large number of primary sources employed, many of which are now lost or no longer available. Among his most important publications are: \\"Zbory i senatorowie protestanccy w dawnej Polsce\\" (1904) (Protestant churches and senators in old Poland) and \\"Zbi√≥r pomnik√≥w reformacji ko≈õcio≈Ça polskiego i litewskiego\\" (Monumenta Reformationis Polonicae et Lithuanicae) (1911). Merczyng and Jan Jakubowski mathematically analyzed and described prince Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç's 17th-century map of Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

This was due to the use of poorly seasoned timber which was thus heavier than calculated. As much of Danish naval strategy was planned around the relatively shallower waters of the Kattegat and Great Belt, compared with the deeper North Sea and Baltic, this could be a problem. The controversy grew as blame was cast on Benstrup, and other senior officers played out their animosities and conspired to court martial the designerSee Knud Nielsen Benstrup for the commission of inquiry and court martial. As an expensive capital ship Christian Sextus appears never to have actually left harbour, and was fully commissioned only once in her 35 years of life.

Formula Two had become too expensive, and was dominated by works-run cars with factory engines; the hope was that Formula 3000 would offer quicker, cheaper, more open racing. The series began as an open specification, then tyres were standardized from 1986 onwards, followed by engines and chassis in 1996.

History The church started life in 1823 as a chapel-of-ease to the parish church at Tormoham. The current building was designed by George Edmund Street and built between 1861 and 1873. The chancel was built first by Wall and Hook of Brunscomb, Gloucester at a cost of ¬£4,000. It chancel was consecrated by the Lord Bishop of Jamaica, Rt. Revd. Aubrey Spencer acting for the diocesan bishop, on 8 November 1864. It contained carving by Thomas Earp and mosaic work by Antonio Salviati. The north aisle was completed next and opened in 1866. Construction on the nave and south aisle was begun in 1870 and it opened on 2 April 1871. The west tower was completed in 1884-85 at a cost of ¬£2,000 to the designs of Arthur Edmund Street and the contractor being Mr. Chubb of Torquay. Special services were held on Thursday 30 April 1885 to mark the completion of the tower. A new bell was dedicated on 7 October 1885 which was cast in E flat by Warner and Son of London with a weight of nearly 19 cwt. The lady chapel was decorated between 1888 and 1890 by John Dando Sedding. The chapel was divided from the chancel and aisle by iron grills, and approached by a polished Torquay marble step was the ornate altar and reredos. New seating of oak was placed on oak platforms and the floor. The fronts and back were carved and traceried, and the ends of the seats had fleur de lis termination, and the sides had shields with sunken carved panels with scenes from The Passion. The work was carried out by Harry Hems of Longbrook Street, Exeter. Incumbents Organ A temporary organ was acquired from Dicker of Exeter when the church opened, but when the nave was completed a new organ was built in 1872 by William Hill & Sons. The pipe organ has three manuals and pedals, with 47 speaking stops. A specification of the organ can be found in the National Pipe Organ Register. =Organists= References Torquay Torquay Category:Torquay ","title":"St John's Church, Torquay"},{"id":"61924438","text":"Preso No. 1 is an American political thriller drama television series produced by Keshet International and Telemundo Global Studios based on an original idea of idea by Shira Hadad and Dror Mishani who are also executive producers.

The commandery was established in the Qin dynasty, possibly as Linzi Commandery (Ëá®ËèëÈÉ°). In early Western Han dynasty, it became part of the Qi Kingdom under Liu Fei, son of Liu Bang, and his descendants. In 165 BC, Liu Ze (ÂäâÂâá), the grandson of Fei and reigning King of Qi, died without issue and the Han court divided the kingdom among the sons of Fei. Linzi Commandery became the fief of Liu Jiangl√º (ÂäâÂ∞áÈñ≠) and retained the name \\"Qi\\", although it was only a fraction of Fei's Qi Kingdom. In 127 BC, Liu Cichang (ÂäâÊ¨°Êòå) died without issue, and the territory became directly administered by the Han central government as the Qi Commandery.Book of Han, Chapter 14. In late Western Han dynasty, the commandery consisted of 12 counties and marquessates: Linzi (Ëá®Ê∑Ñ), Changguo (ÊòåÂúã), Li (Âà©), Xi'an (Ë•øÂÆâ), Juding (ÈâÖÂÆö), Guang (Âª£), Guangrao (Âª£È•í), Zhaonan (Êò≠Âçó), Linqu (Ëá®Êúê), Beixiang (ÂåóÈÑâ), Pingguang (Âπ≥Âª£) and Taixiang (Ëá∫ÈÑâ). The total population in 2 AD was 554,444, in 154,826 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. The seat was Linzi, capital of the Warring States era Qi state. In Eastern Han dynasty, Qi was the fief of Liu Zhang (ÂäâÁ´†), nephew of Emperor Guangwu, and his descendants until 206 AD.Book of Later Han, Chapter 14. In 140 AD, there were 6 counties, namely Linzi, Xi'an, Changguo, Linqu, Guang and Banyang (Ëà¨ÈôΩ), with a total population of 491,765 (64,415 households).Book of Later Han, Chapter 112. In Cao Wei dynasty, Qi was granted to Cao Fang, adopted son of Emperor Ming of Wei. After the foundation of Western Jin, Qi was granted to Sima You, brother of Emperor Wu, and passed to his descendants until the Yongjia era.Book of Jin, Chapter 59. In Northern Wei, Qi administered 9 counties, including Linzi, Changguo, Yidu (ÁõäÈÉΩ), Panyang (Áõ§ÈôΩ), Pingchang (Âπ≥Êòå), Guangrao, Xi'an, Anping (ÂÆâÂπ≥) and Guangchuan (Âª£Â∑ù). According to the Book of Wei, the population was 82,100, in 30,848 households.Book of Wei, Chapter 106. The commandery was abolished in early Sui dynasty.

He is particularly well known for his portraits of figures such as Queen Victoria and the British prime minister Sir Robert Peel, and the bequests of his personal library and art collection to Swansea Library and the British Museum.  Early life in Swansea  Francis was born in Swansea in south Wales. He was the son of a Swansea coach builder, John Francis and his wife Mary. According to the Welsh historian T. Mardy Rees, Francis demonstrated an early aptitude for painting and 'attracted notice by his designs and paintings in his father's workshop'. As he grew older, Francis concentrated his energy on portraiture and executed several portraits of notable figures in Camarthen and Glamorgan, while he lived in Swansea. Later, he became a member of the Dolly Hunting Club and received commission for portraits from fellow members.  Career in London  In the 1840s Francis traveled to London to develop his career as a portrait painter. While in London he befriended the artist and caricaturist Joseph Kenny Meadows and the writer Charles Dickens whom he accompanied on expeditions to the slums, to help discover material for Dickens' books. While in London, Francis also met John Ruskin and William Thackery. In 1857, he became a founding member of the Savage Club, a literary gentleman's society, attending the society's first meeting in Drury Lane with William Brough, Leicester Silk Buckingham and William Bernhardt Tegetmeier among others. It is also possible that Francis was responsible for the name of the Society since 'it was he who presented the Club with the tomahawks, assegais and other savage weapons that decorated the walls of the Club.'  Portrait painting and engraving  alt=Francis was most successful as a figure and portrait painter. During his artistic career he completed a number of portraits of well known societal and political figures including Queen Victoria and Sir Robert Peel. Deffett's watercolour portrait of Queen Victoria (pictured on the right), displays the monarch with her dog, Dash, bounding by her side. The young monarch stands in a garden, elegantly attired in a bonnet and shawl. The painting was executed in 1837, the year that Queen Victoria assumed the throne, which may account for her youthful appearance. The painting was engraved and printed by Frederick Christian Lewis in 1838, a year after its original completion, and is still held in the Royal Collection. Prints made after John Deffett Francis' figurative portrait paintings include: Madlle. Cerito: A Dancer (1858); Emma Romer, lithograph (n.d.); Fanny Cerito (1846); W.C. Macready (n.d.); Major General Sir William Nott, (1845); Captain Bowen Davies (1844) and Robert Peel (1841), and form part of the bequest made to the British Museum.  Other works  Aside from some notable portrait commissions, Francis' work did not attract significant patronage or commercial success. However, between 1837-1860 Francis exhibited one picture at the Royal Academy, one at the British Institution and six at the Suffolk Street Exhibition including the painting Autumn-Scotland-Evening, which received a favorable review in the Illustrated London News Supplement.  The Deffett Francis Collection  North Wales, an oil painting by John Deffett Francis at the National Library of Wales Throughout his adult life, Francis was a devoted collector of rare books, prints and curiosities. This was also a family trait since his brother, George Grant Francis, was a successful antiquarian. In 1876, Francis made a generous bequest of his personal library, including art books, to the Swansea Public Library, while he was still alive. The Preface to a catalogue of the collection printed in 1887 introduces the donation in the following manner: ‚ÄòIn the year 1876, Mr. John Deffett Francis, desirous of promoting to the utmost of his power the study of Literature and Art in his native Town, determined to make a gift of his Library, consisting chiefly of Books on Art and subjects connected therewith, to his fellow townsmen.‚Äô In a subsequent catalogue statement dated 25 May 1887, the author of the Preface notes that: Artists Impression of Swansea, c. 1800. Portrait of Robert Peel by John Deffett Francis, 1841 ‚ÄòThe Library thus presented to the Burgesses consisted of between 600 and 700 volumes; but Mr. Francis was not satisfied to stop here. His object was the education of his fellow burgesses in Literature and Art, and in furtherance of that object he shortly afterwards gave a considerable collection of Drawings and Engravings, many of them of great rarity and beauty; and he determined to make the Library and collection of Pictures mutually illustrative.‚Äô Overall, the collection of artefacts that Francis collected and donated to Swansea Public Library between 1876 and his death in 1901 totalled 7,000 books and 2,000 pictures and engravings. Subsequently, Francis became a committee member of Swansea Library and curator of the fine arts. This substantial holding also led to the establishment of a 'D.F.' Art Gallery and Library, opened by William Gladstone in 1887. As a whole the library contains books on a huge variety of science and arts subjects including anatomy, free masonry, antique art and botany. It acts as a monument to the eclecticism of his tastes as well as his broad learning and erudition. The John Deffett Francis collection was later transferred to the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery. Francis also bequeathed a collection of 20,000 prints, drawings and books to the British Museum.  In verse  Surprisingly little is known about Francis' personal life. However, some insights are suggested by a satirical poem written by Wyndham Lawrence in 1876, which cites Francis and some of his contemporaries then living in Swansea.MS 2868E, National Library of Wales, Satirical Poem, Wyndham Lawrence, 1876. The satirical poem entitled 'Will of J.D. Francis Esq.' was printed in an edition of 110 copies and is dated 30th June 1876. As this is the same year that Francis made his generous donation of books to the Swansea Library, this may well be a playful response to this philanthropic incident, a reading that is supported by the poem itself, as the first-person narrator makes a series of joking 'bequests': 'I J. Deffett Francis, of Swansea Town, Archaeologist, A-thiest and Artist, Astronomer, Actor of some renown, Curiosity, Critic and Chartist, In the Name of Goodness Gracious! hereby Make this my last Will and Testament.''Satirical Poem' by Wyndham Lawrence, 1877. National Library Wales, MS 2868E, recto, ll. 1-6. As a whole the poem supports a view of Francis as a dilettante with eclectic tastes. The poem also suggests that Francis suffered from poor health, was fond of women, ostentatious clothes, smoking pipes and often out of pocket. There is little information available about the author, Wyndham Lawrence, save what is included in the poem itself: 'he's a good, sanctimonious youth,/ And gazes on Gin with abhorrence‚Äô.'Satirical Poem' by Wyndham Lawrence, 1876. NLW MS 2868E, recto, ll. 27-8. Francis died on 21 February 1901 at Bellevue Street, Swansea.

Baxter, Llandudno, c. 1920s John Silas Evans, Rev. (1864-1953) was a Welsh astronomer and priest. He became a senior figure within the Welsh Anglican Church and is well known for his astronomical writing published in Welsh and English.  Early life and education  John Silas Evans was born in the village of Pencarreg in Carmarthenshire, south-west Wales. He attended Alcwyn's School in Carmarthen and a grammar school in Lampeter before studying at St David's College, Lampeter. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in Theology in 1885 and won prizes for science and the Welsh language.[1] Evans lectured at a college in Coventry for a year before his religious ordination in 1887.  Clerical career  John Silas Evans had a varied and successful clerical career within the Anglican Church. He was first ordained as a deacon at St. Asaph Cathedral, Denbighshire, in 1887 and priested in 1888. Evans remained based in Welsh parishes, serving as a curate of Dyserth, Denbighshire, between 1887‚Äì90 and of Rhos-ddu between 1890-1895. He served as a vicar of St. Asaph (1895-1901) and of the parish of Gyffylliod (1901-9), before settling in his role as vicar of the village church in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant. Evans remained in this remote parish community in the Berwyn Mountains for nearly three decades, until 1938.[2]  Parish historian  St Dogfan's Church in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant Canon Silas Evans had a profound interest in the history of the parish of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, where he served as vicar for most of his life. He lived in the church vicarage, one of the largest vicarages in the St. Asaph bishopric, set in a two-acre garden. This was also the residence of another illustrious historical personage associated with the area, Dr William Morgan, who served as vicar of St Dogfans between 1578-88 and translated the Bible into the Welsh language. Evans expressed his interest in the social, archeological and religious history of his parish in a Welsh language publication entitled Hanes Plwyf Llanrhaeadr ym Mochnant ('The History of the parish of Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant') first published in 1940 and translated into English by Ceinwen Edwards in 1998. This parish history includes facts and anecdotes about salient local landmarks such as the nearby Pistyll Rhaedr waterfall, and a number of nearby standing stones (menhirs) and barrows. As well as discussing the area's ancient, druidic history, Evans touches on aspects of village's religious life, folklore and engagement with ancient healing magic, such as the use of elder bark to heal cancerous skin growths. Evans wrote at length about the interior of the Church of St Dogfans, describing it as 'beautiful' and noting 'that the building is very old, though, naturally, it has been restored many times.\\" One of the adaptations of the church interior that Evans was personally responsible for included the painting of stars and planets on the ceiling of the Church.  Astronomical writing  On 31 January 1923 Evans was elected to the membership of the British Astronomical Association. He was proposed by Arthur Mee. On 9 November 1923 Evans was elected to the fellowship of the Royal Astronomical Society. These elections followed a life-time's interest in science and astronomy in evidence since his student days. One of Evans' most popular books, The Marvels of the Sky: An Introduction to Popular Astronomy (1921), was written while he lived in the vicarage in Llanrhaeadr. In the author's preface, Evans dedicates his book ‚Äòto my constant and faithful companion, my old Refractor telescope‚Äô. Evans' telescope was a four-inch telescope manufactured by the London optician Charles Tulley. Other astronomical writings by Evans include the Welsh language texts: Seryddiaeth a seryddwyr ('Astronomy and Astronomers'), 1923 and Myfyrion min yr hwyr, ('Evening Reflections'),1949.  Published sermons  Another format that Evans used to express his faith and interest in astronomy, were his sermons. He published Ad Astra, a collection of eight astronomical sermons concerned with the relationship between science and religion, in 1930. In his introduction to the book Evans defines these rhetorical pieces as 'a short series of sermons, or addresses, of an astronomical character, on the religious aspect of the science.‚Äô The first sermon, 'In the Beginning, God', explores the conflict between science and religion. Evans discusses several controversial points, such as the implications that scientific estimates for age of the planet hold for the story of creation in Genesis and the implications that Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution hold for Christian faith. Subsequent sermons explore astronomical themes both within the context of Christianity and in a broader, secular context. For example, his sixth sermon, 'Are the Planets Inhabited?‚Äô discusses the possibility of alien life forms and his seventh sermon, ‚ÄòWhich was the Star of Bethlehem?' discusses the scientific basis, as well as the broader spiritual and metaphorical meaning of this well-known Star. Evans' work participates in a tradition of famous scientific churchmen such as John Donne, the metaphysical poet and Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, whose well-known interest in astronomy and the Scientific Revolution found expression in his religious sermons as well as his lyric poetry. Evans enjoyed a high reputation for his sermons within his lifetime and preached at St. Paul's Cathedral in London in 1939. According to the author Mary Gwendoline Ellis, Evans 'had an exceptional memory and he could conduct church services almost completely from memory'.Church of Pencarreg, c. 1887  Later years  In 1938 Evans retired and moved to Aberystwyth, reputedly to be in close proximity to the National Library of Wales. He named his house in Aberystwyth 'Ad Astra', after the name of his book. Subsequently, Evans returned to his native village of Pencarreg where he died on the 19th April 1953. He is buried in the graveyard of Pencarreg church.

However, The North would attack Shamrock before he even got in the ring. The following week, The North came to address their assault, only for Shamrock to come out looking for a fight. He was eventually joined by Sami Callihan, fighting off The North alongside his rival before disappearing into the night. EVP Scott D'Amore, looking to appease to an irate Ethan Page, scheduled a tag team title match between The North and the team of Shamrock and Callihan for Slammiversary. At the event, Alexander and Page were able to defend the titles against Callihan and Shamrock.

His maternal grandparents were Ferenc S√ºmeghy de Lov√°sz et Szentmargitha (1819‚Äì1869), jurist, landowner, politician, member of the Hungarian Parliament (who was a very good friend of Ferenc De√°k), and Magdolna S√©llyey de S√©llye (1822‚Äì1901). D√©nes' had two older brothers: Tibor Farkas de Boldogfa (1883‚Äì1940), landowner, politician, also member of the Hungarian Parliament, and K√°lm√°n Farkas de Boldogfa (1880‚Äì1944), landowner, supreme chief magistrate of the district of Zalaszentgr√≥t (f≈ëszolgab√≠r√≥) in the county of Zala. After high school, he graduated from the Hungarian Academy of Agriculture and soon he administrated his lands in S√∂jt√∂r and leased the property of the Szombathely priesthood farm in Mez≈ë√∂rs. On 1912 he married the noble lady M√°ria Stef√°nia Sz≈±cs de Szentj√°nos (1891‚Äì1956), who gave birth a girl and a boy to D√©nes. During his farming years in S√∂jt√∂r he dealt with horses with great passion. In 1916, he bought Grignan, winner of the St. Stephen's Prize of 1905. After his mother's death, D√©nes inherited an estate from the S√ºmeghy family in S√∂jt√∂r. D√©nes was a politician mainly through his father J√≥zsef Farkas de Boldogfa, who was also a member of the Parliament in the colors of the Catholic People's Party, and was first involved in agricultural interest organizations. D√©nes joined the Independent Smallholders Party in the 1930s, where he played an active role. His writings and articles were mainly published in several newspapers.Vad√°sz- √©s Versenylap 60. √©vfolyam, 1916. 23 January 1916 / 3.sz√°m Following the Arrow Cross coup (19 October 1944), he retired to his estate in S√∂jt√∂r. After the war, in 1946 he was the executive chairman of the Smallholders' Party in Zala County, and a year later in 1947, he was co-chairman. In the meantime, until 10 August 1947, he was the responsible publisher of the Independent Zala newspaper. At the 1945 National Parliamentary election, the party started on the Zala county list but did not win a mandate. In 1947 he withdrew from the FKGP and joined the Democratic People's Party in protest of the left-wing movement, which was later included in the parliamentary election on 31 August 1947. In the meantime, after a land reform, he owned 60 hectares of land, which he was forced to offer to the Als√≥fakos State Farm in 1949. After his term of office expired (1949) he completely retired from public life. Despite this, the new system deprived it of all his possessions and deployed it on the edge of S√∂jt√∂r. From there he moved to Budapest with his daughter. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 he also took part of it as well. As the oldest member of the former representatives of the Democratic People's Party, on 1 November 1956, he issued a call to Kossuth Radio to reorganize the DNP. D√©nes encouraged the former DNP organizations in the countryside and the capital to organize peacefully and calmly. Prior to this, the Prime Minister, Imre Nagy, was informed by letter on 30 October (S√°ndor Keresztes, Vid Mihelics, K√°lm√°n Imre Sz√©kely and his signature) about the party's transformation. After the fall of the revolution, he was prosecuted by the newly formed Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, where he was sentenced to two years in prison. During the retaliation, he was interned in 1957 and had to serve three months of his sentence in the Marianostrian Prison.Zsumbera √Årp√°d. OLD BOY Boldogfai Farkas D√©nes √©lete. 2019.

She won the in 2010 for her second poetry collection, Ibyeorui jaeguseong.  Biography  An was born in Taebaek, South Korea. Due to poverty, she attended vocational high school rather than regular high school. During high school days, she was an active member of the school's literature club, but upon graduation, she had to work as an office clerk for a major company. Then in her late 20s, she attended college by taking evening classes, majoring in creative writing at Seoul National University of Science and Technology. Working by day and writing poems by night, she debuted in 2001 as poet by publishing ‚ÄúGomgom‚Äù (Í≥∞Í≥∞ Bear Bear), ‚ÄúHasisi‚Äù (ÌïòÏãúÏãú Hashish) and other poems. An‚Äôs first poetry collection, Í≥∞Í≥∞ (Bear Bear; 2006), is mainly about her own experiences and daily life. Poems ‚ÄúOktapbang‚Äù (Ïò•ÌÉëÎ∞© The Rooftop Room) and ‚ÄúTelegraph Lies‚Äù (Í±∞ÏßìÎßêÏùÑ ÌÉÄÏ†ÑÌïòÎã§) reflect upon her own experience of living in a shabby rooftop room in Ahyeon- dong, Seoul, after she moved into the city by herself. Perhaps for this reason, her early works often feature specific geographical names related to Seoul, such as ‚Äúahyeon-dong sandongne‚Äù (hilly village in Ahyeong-dong) and ‚Äúcheongnyangni guldari‚Äù (the underpass in Cheongnyangni), suggesting that the root of her poetic sensibility was formed from her memories of wandering without roots. In addition, the vignettes of the 1970s, illustrated by poetic phrases ‚Äúbikini otjang‚Äù (portable wardrobe), ‚Äúsundaegukbap‚Äù (blood sausage and rice soup), ‚Äúbeongaetan‚Äù (starter briquette), ‚Äúyeontangaseu jungdok‚Äù (briquette gas poisoning), and ‚Äúheonchaekbang‚Äù (used bookstore) are considered the reflections of her young adulthood dominated by poverty and extreme loneliness. Such poetic themes, when met with her unique wordplay, create a buoyant vibe. She creates new meanings by replacing the originally associated Chinese characters of Korean words with new characters, for example, using yukgyo (ËÇâ‰∫§) instead of yukgyo (Èô∏Ê©ã) and siksa (È£üÊ≠ª) instead of siksa (È£ü‰∫ã),Lee, Sang-ju. ‚ÄúAn Heon-mi Publishes First Poetry Collection Gomgom.‚Äù Kyunghyang Shinmun, January 30, 2006. http://news.khan.co.kr/kh_news/khan_art_view.html?art_id=200601301655401. while also slightly modifying the sounds and meanings of words, for instance, using jjagatustra instead of jjaratustra (Zarathustra). In contrast to her first poetry collection, An's second book, Ïù¥Î≥ÑÏùò Ïû¨Íµ¨ÏÑ± (Reconstructing Separation; 2009), expresses a much broader perspective, even though both collections handle similar subject matters and content. Her wordplay is also featured in the second collection. For instance, she creates poetic tension by placing confusion into meaning when she separates the word ‚Äúibyeol‚Äù (Ïù¥Î≥Ñ separation) into two words ‚Äúi byeol‚Äù (Ïù¥ Î≥Ñ this star) by inserting a space in the middle. Her second collection also includes meta-poems that constantly throw doubts and question the very moment, the very space, and the very act of writing her own poems.An Heon-mi and Nam-hun Son. ‚ÄúPossibilities of What‚Äôs Poetic: Its Ambiguous Appeal.‚Äù In Impossible Conversations. Busan: Sanjini, 2011. Similarly, in An's third poetry collection, ÏÇ¨ÎûëÏùÄ Ïñ¥ÎäêÎÇ† ÏàòÎ¶¨ÎêúÎã§ (Love Will Be Repaired Someday; 2014), wordplay is still a dominant feature while its poems revolve around her own experiences based on her love of life and people.

Jinan was established in early Western Han dynasty under the Qi Kingdom of Liu Fei, son of Emperor Gaozu. In 165 BC, Liu Ze (ÂäâÂâá), the grandson of Fei and reigning King of Qi, died without issue and the Han court divided the kingdom among the sons of Fei, and Jinan became a short-lived principality ruled by Liu Piguang. During the Rebellion of the Seven States, Piguang was killed, and Jinan was converted to a commandery.Book of Han, Chapter 14. In late Western Han dynasty, the commandery consisted of 14 counties and marquessates: Dongpingling (Êù±Âπ≥Èôµ), Zouping (ÈÑíÂπ≥), Tai (Ëá∫), Liangzou (Ê¢ÅÈÑí), Tugu (ÂúüÈºì), Yuling (ÊñºÈôµ), Yangqiu (ÈôΩ‰∏ò), Banyang (Ëà¨ÈôΩ), Jian (ËèÖ), Zhaoyang (ÊúùÈôΩ), Licheng (Ê≠∑Âüé), Xiao (Áåá), Zhu (Ëëó) and Yicheng (ÂÆúÊàê). The population in 2 AD was 642,884, in 140,761 households.Book of Han, Chapter 28. For much of Eastern Han, Jinan was a nominal kingdom/principality and served as the fief of various members of the imperial clan, with the first being Liu Kang, son of Emperor Guangwu, in 39 AD. In Cao Wei dynasty, the Prince of Jinan was Cao Kai (ÊõπÊ•∑), a grandson of Cao Cao ad a son of Cao Zhang, Prince of Rencheng. Jinan reverted to a commandery after the foundation of Western Jin. In 140 AD, the territory consisted of 10 counties, including Dongpingling, Zhu, Yuling, Tai, Jian, Tugu, Liangzou, Zouping, Dongzhaoyang (Êù±ÊúùÈôΩ) and Licheng. The population in 140 AD was 453,308, in 78,544 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 112. The commandery was conquered by Northern Wei in early Northern and Southern Dynasties period, during Emperor Ming of Song's reign. The commandery then consisted of 6 counties, namely Licheng, Zhaoyang, Zhu, Tugu, Fengling (ÈÄ¢Èôµ) and Pingling (Âπ≥Èôµ).

Background At the outbreak of World War II the Marine nationale (French Navy) needed ships for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and, following the Royal Navy's example, placed orders from Smith‚Äôs Dock in South Bank, Middlesbrough, for four ASW corvettes. Following this the Marine nationale ordered a further 18 ships, to be built at a number of British and French shipyards; 6 were built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast. The Fall of France in June 1940 brought a drastic change to these building programmes. Of the second order, the 12 ships under construction in Britain were taken over by the RN and re-armed with British ordnance; all of these French corvettes were renamed and given 'Flower' names in keeping with the class.From Harland and Wolff: , HMS Alisma (K185), , HMS Armeria (K187), HMS Aster (K188) & HMS Alisma (and HMS Burdock) wore a yellow and blue pattern of ship camouflage in the Atlantic. The colour faded quickly in service, becoming a yellow-tinged, off-white colour. Officers and crew During her service with the Royal Navy she was commanded by Acting Lieutenant Commander Maurice George Rose, RANVR from 2 May 1941 to 1 May 1943. He was succeeded by Lieutenant George Lanning, RANVR until 11 June 1945. The RANVR was a volunteer reserve force of the Royal Australian Navy. Rose, as a Lieutenant, joined HMS Erica building at Harland and Wolff in Belfast. The ship was commissioned in August 1940. Promotion to Acting Lieutenant Commander with seniority from 4 October 1940 aroused in the 38 year old thoughts of his own command. Rose wrote to the Admiralty informing them that he would like promotion, not to a trawler, but a new corvette from Harland and Wolff with all his officers to be Australian Reservists; he also requested that his anti-submarine ratings be Australians. The specific request for a Harland and Wolff ship had come after a study of vessels from various yards convinced him of the superiority of that company‚Äôs craft. My Lords of the Admiralty, surprisingly, had granted his request when Rose commissioned HMS Alisma on 14 February 1941. Service history =Battle of the Atlantic= In 1941 Western Approached Command had formed 8 escort groups. The 1st Escort Group consisted of six destroyers and four Flower-class corvettes.HMS Alisma (K185), HMS Dianella (K07), HMS Kingcup (K33) & HMS Sunflower (K41) They were soon in action with other groups between 19 July ‚Äì 1 August 1941 with Convoy ON 69 defending 26 merchant ships from 8 U-boats and 2 Italian submarines. Corvettes of B7 Group moored in Londonderry. Alisma, Dianella, Sunflower & Kingcup. The white areas are where the official censor has painted out security sensitive material In February and March 1942 the original eight escort groups were reorganized into the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF). Alisma was part of Escort Group B7, one of seven such British naval groups which served with the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF). It provided convoy protection in the most dangerous midsection of the North Atlantic route. B7's first convoys, in the spring of 1942, were uneventful, and as the pace of the Battle of the Atlantic hotted up in the summer and autumn, the group's charges were escorted without loss. But in December, while escorting ON 153, the convoy came under attack, and three ships were sunk. During this action, on 11 December, Firedrake was torpedoed by the U-boat and sank with the loss of 168 of her crew, including her current commander, and the group's Senior Officer ‚Äì Escort (SOE), Commander Eric Tilden. Initially 35 survived the torpedoing, but only 27 managed to get on board Sunflower, which was under the command of Lieut- Commander John Treasure Jones.Tramp to Queen pp. 69‚Äì79 B7 was involved in the battles for convoys ONS 20 and ON 206, ON 207 and ON 208, during which period nine U-boats were destroyed. =Battle of the Mediterranean= From autumn 1943 until April 1945 Alisma was deployed in the Mediterranean escorting KMS and MKS convoys. The KMS series of mercantile convoy sailed from the UK to Gibraltar and onward into the Mediterranean from October 1942. The MKS series of convoy replaced the earlier HG series and ran from the Mediterranean to the UK via Gibraltar. The new series was introduced after Operation Torch in October 1942 and operated until May 1945. She then returned to the North Atlantic until the end of the war, escorting convoys between Liverpool and New York. Fate Alisma was decommissioned on 11 June 1945. She was sold in 1947 and became the merchant ship SS Laconia in 1949. operated by Cia Maritima Mensabe SA, Panama City. Purchased by K. Samartzopoulos of Piraeus in 1950 and renamed SS Constantinos S and then by D. Efthimiou of Piraeus in 1952 and renamed SS Parnon. She sunk as a result of water leakage (flooding) on 16 July 1954.

Early life Peabody was born on April 11, 1849 in New York City. He was one of four children of Judge Charles Augustus Peabody (1814‚Äì1901) and, his first wife, Julia Caroline (n√©e Livingston) Peabody (1816‚Äì1878) who married at Trinity Church in 1846. Among his siblings was brother Dr. George Livingston Peabody (who married Jane de Peyster Huggins), Philip Glendower Peabody and Julia Livingston Peabody (the wife of Charles J. Nourse).

The toponym \\"Rivi√®re Saint-Jean\\" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Place Names Bank of the Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec.Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec - rivi√®re Saint- Jean/ref> Fishing In May 2015 the Ministry of Forests, Wildlife and Parks of Quebec announced a sport fishing catch-and-release program for large salmon on sixteen of Quebec's 118 salmon rivers. These were the Mitis, Laval, Pigou, Bouleau, aux Rochers, Jupitagon, Magpie, Saint-Jean, Corneille, Piashti, Watshishou, Little Watshishou, Nabisipi, Aguanish and Natashquan rivers. The Quebec Atlantic Salmon Federation said that the measures did not go nearly far enough in protecting salmon for future generations. In view of the rapidly declining Atlantic salmon population catch-and-release should have been implemented on all rivers apart from northern Quebec. The Pourvoirie de la Haute Saint-Jean has exclusive rights to three fishing areas with 55 pools along of the Saint-Jean and of the Salmon River (Rivi√®re aux Saumons). Between 2012 and 2016 the annual average reported catch of salmon was 123 juveniles and 28 large fish, with 412 returned to the water.

It is the eleventh novel in his series featuring crime solver and sports agent Myron Bolitar. The story in Home takes place approximately one year after the events of Live Wire (2011), during which time the Win character has been in hiding. Some of the character histories referenced are actually revealed in the spinoff Mickey Bolitar books, a series of three young adult novels featuring Myron Bolitar's nephew. The stories in those three novels precede the events of Home. The Real Book Spy notes that: \\"Dedicated fans are treated to a number of juicy tidbits and inside jokes. And, for the first time ever, several chapters are told in the first-person narrative through Win's perspective, allowing readers an inside look at the thinking and personality of Myron's sidekick like never before.\\" Jackie K. Cooper at Huffington Post writes: \\"The word 'home' refers to many things in this book ‚Ä¶ Coben takes all of these definitions and blends them together to make this an exciting but reflective story. There is an element of brutality in some parts, but elsewhere there are warm and fuzzy moments. Neither is used in the extreme.\\" Plot summary After a year in hiding, Win contacts Myron to say he has located Patrick Moore, now 16, one of two boys kidnapped ten years ago from the home of Brooke Baldwin, Win's cousin. The other six-year old kidnapped was Brooke's son, Rhys. After initial ransom demands, the kidnappers mysteriously went silent. Patrick is apparently working in the sex trade under duress in London. Working with Win, Myron is able to rescue Patrick from his captor, but is unable to secure another teenager thought to be Rhys Baldwin. As the hunt for Rhys continues, Myron and Win, with help from Mickey Bolitar and his school friends, try to get to the bottom of the complicated Moore and Baldwin family dynamics, as well as determine if Patrick is really who he claims to be. When the mystery of what happened that fateful day ten years ago is finally revealed, Myron must race the clock to keep another tragedy from occurring. Main characters *Myron Bolitar: former partner at MB Reps talent agency and part-time crime solver. *Windsor Horne \\"Win\\" Lockwood III: wealthy owner of Locke-Horne Securities & Investments; Myron's best friend and sidekick. *Patrick Moore: one of two young boys abducted from wealthy families ten years ago, the other being Win's nephew Rhys Baldwin. *Fat Gandhi (Real name: Christopher Allan Weeks): a human trafficker living in London who initially holds Patrick and (possibly) Rhys hostage. *Nancy Moore: Patrick's mother. *Hunter Moore: Nancy's husband and Patrick's father. *Brooke Baldwin: Rhys's mother and Win's cousin. *Chick Baldwin: Brooke's ex-husband and Rhys's father. *Mickey Bolitar: a high school student, son of Brad and Kitty Bolitar, and nephew of Myron Bolitar. *Ema Wyatt: Mickey's goth girlfriend.

Like other countries in West Africa, the impacts of climate change are expected to be varied and complex, and climate change adaptation is going to be important to Sustainable development in the country.  Effects  The Sahel climate makes the ecoregion particulary vulnerable to changes in water. Climate change is expected to increase or make more severe windstorms, floods, droughts, and coastal erosion and saltwater intrusion. = Economic effects = Agriculture is 26% of the GDP and employs 68% of the labor force. Much of the agriculture is rain fed, so changes in precipitation will have significant impacts. In 2012, drought plus increased food prices led to a food crisis in the region. Rice farmers near the coast are also experiencing Saltwater intrusion. Fisheries are also vulnerable, with changes to breeding grounds for coastal fishery species putting additional pressure on already unsustainable fishery practices. Infrastructure is already seeing major losses from flooding and windstorms. For example, urban floods in 2020 severely damaged at least 2371 houses, and destroyed crops.  Political action  The Gambia has published a Climate Change Priority Action Plan that focuses on 24 cross-sectoral activities.

Like many other countries in Africa, Liberia both faces existing environmental issues, as well as sustainable development challenges. Because of its location in Africa, it is vulnerable to extreme weather, coastal effects of sea level rise, and changing water systems and water availability. Climate change is expected to severely impact the Liberian economy, especially agriculture, fisheries, and forestry. Liberia has been an active participant in international and local policy changes related to climate change.  Impacts  = Water scarcity = High evaporation, changes in seasonal rainfall patterns, and runoff decreases, are expected to lead to decreased water and worse water quality. Additionally, by the 2020s the Mount Coffee Hydropower Project is expected to have challenges maintain water supply. Moreover, sea level rise is expected to cause increase salinization in important coastal communities. In particular, increased runoff is expected to create increased water quality problems, exacerbating existing water quality challenges. = Sea level rise = Population density and low elevation coastal zones. Monrovia is especially vulnerable to sea level rise. 60% of the population of Liberia lives along the coast. As sea level rises, its expected to put pressure on a number of populations, including communities in slums such as the West Point Slum. Additionally, this sea level rise is expected to incured loses of $250 million. = Agriculture = 61% of the GDP and 75% of employment is in the agriculture sector. Climate change is expected to have a number of impacts on extreme weather, plus decreasing crop yields to create food insecurity.  Policy  Liberia was one of the first recipients of the Green Climate Fund, and received significant funding in 2014 from Norway in order to address forestry practices, fossil fuels subsidies, and renewable energy in the country.

The term \\"whiteshift\\" was coined predominantly by Birkbeck College professor Eric Kaufmann, considered a specialist both in political demography and demography, and his 2018 book Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration and the Future of White Majorities. The phenomenon had also been described as white decline or racial shift previously and has since been variously discussed, analyzed, and academically researched as a political and demographic phenomenon. Definition White decline or white racial shift, abbreviated frequently to whiteshift (sometimes white shift or white-shift) is the demographic decline of populations of white people, usually in the Western world, as defined by various national census bureaus, governmental organizations, or as mentioned in scholarly or journalistic works. The concept can be referred to pan-regionally, continentally (e.g. North America), or within a district or other local level. Background In 2014, Thomas B. Edsall, discussing a Public Religion Research Institute survey designed \\"to assess anxieties concerning the changing racial makeup of the country\\", analyzed research which had concluded that \\"making this racial shift salient could bring more moderate White Americans into the Republican Party, as well as increase turnout among White Americans who already consider themselves Republicans. Historian Michael Burleigh has drawn attention to an aspect of whiteshift, which outlines how mixed-race people and public figures, such as politicians Iain Duncan Smith in the UK, Dutch politician Geert Wilders and US Senator Ted Cruz, will increasingly become integrated into white majorities. In 2018, demographer Dowell Myers wrote that, under an exclusive definition of whiteness, such as being solely of European descent, \\"whites are indeed in numerical decline\\" in the US. Also referencing congressman Ted Cruz, in relation to shifting classification of white, as well as Meghan Markle, Myers analyzed the trend toward recognizing an inclusive, multiracial definition for white majorities when factoring in the demographic phenomenon. In 2019, academic Ghassan Hage proposed how the fear-based distortion and political capitalization of the demographic phenomenon, provided the ongoing danger of fueling extremism and propaganda, such as that involved in the Christchurch mosque shootings. A Gothenburg-Post-analysis of the decline, referencing journalist Ivar Arpi's commentary of what the publication described as a demographic threat in Sweden, identified Arpi's description and modelling as making use of whiteshift theory. Political analyst Michael Barone has written of his \\"cautious optimism\\" for the concept to occur in a societally stable and positive model. The concept denotes as much importance to the converging of racial identities into the dominant culture, as the data-led component of the future numerical minority-status of white people. The author of 2018's Whiteshift has been reported to have stressed the importance, in his view, of exploring the concept in general discourse, to facilitate both conservatives and cosmopolitans experiencing the social phenomenon of whiteshift as a positive development. Simon Fraser University professor, Paul Delany, wrote in 2019 that more extreme societal polarization could provide a challenge to the political acceptance of gradual whiteshift. In 2020, Spiked magazine referenced increasing use of whiteshift, as a concept and explanatory driving force, to describe political upheavals and electoral upsets in the West. Academic study =Racial shift condition= In 2014, professors Jennifer Richeson and Maureen Craig published research, which among various conclusions, outlined white racial shift condition. Their study showed how white people in the US, who were informed of the gradual reduction of the country's white majority, were more likely to demonstrate higher racial intergroup hostility due to the perception of a demographic threat. The study, which was described by Pacific Standard as demonstrating how \\"the coming racial shift evokes higher levels of both explicit and implicit racism on the part of white Americans\\", has been analyzed by sociologist Mary C. Waters, who concurred that demographic projections, and their portrayal in media, are proportionately linked to concern among some white Americans and subsequent increase in racial tensions. =Other studies= In a 2016 study, psychologist Brenda Major conducted research which showed that white Americans, who strongly identified with their racial group, and were exposed to demographic change of reduced number of whites, or provided \\"the racial shift reminder\\", were more likely to vote for Donald Trump during the Republican Party presidential primaries than any other candidate. Published in Social Forces in 2018, two studies conducted by sociologists Rachel Wetts and Robb Willer, showed how telling white Americans that the United States was becoming demographically majority non-white, increased their criticism of welfare. In 2019, separating the concept from Kaufmann's book, the Centre for European Policy Studies analyzed the prediction of future mixed-race majorities in the West, describing it as rooted in evidence for the occurrence of whiteshift, rather than a \\"futuristic end of identity\\" or pan-racial society. In 2020, a Population and Development Review journal piece explored the conflict in the conception of whiteshift as both a demographic phenomenon and cultural identity transition. Citing US Census Bureau statistics, the use of precision in demography was demonstrated to be somewhat compromised by the \\"blurring of ethnic boundaries\\", a factor acknowledged in the theory of whiteshift.

The Great Northern Railway in Yorkshire was a major part of that, although the GNR did not succeed in reaching York as it originally intended. By acquiring running powers it reached Leeds, Bradford and Halifax over other companies' lines, as well as Barnsley Sheffield and Grimsby, and then York too. After acquiring local companies it developed a network, chiefly in West Yorkshire. Later it built lines north and west of Bradford into hilly terrain, and these were very expensive to build, and never repaid the initial cost. Carrying coal to the southern counties was its primary business: huge volumes were conveyed; however fast passenger express trains memorably caught the public imagination. Passenger express operation within West Yorkshire was important too, especially as residential travel developed. The St Leger race meetings at Doncaster attracted huge volumes of excursions, 1,149 excursion trains over four days in 1888.Philipp L Scowcroft, Lines to Doncaster: A Concise History, published by Central Library, Doncaster, 1986, Towards the end of the nineteenth century the earlier raw competition softened, and some co-operation with other major companies became possible, especially with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The Great Northern Railway was a constituent of the London and North Eastern Railway from the Grouping of the railways in 1923, and the LNER itself formed part of the nationally owned British Railways from 1948. As mineral extraction declined in the areas originally served, the fortunes of many branch lines declined too, and in the 1960s many lines closed. Many of the former GNR lines were closed, and the remaining GNR Yorkshire routes are Doncaster to Shaftholme Junction (towards York), Doncaster to Leeds, and Leeds to Bradford via New Pudsey. Authorisation of the Great Northern Railway The Great Northern Railway got its authorising Act of Parliament on 26 June 1846. It was a huge project: its authorised share capital was ¬£5.6 million.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishers, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , pages 236 and 237 At first it had named itself the London and York Railway, and York was to be its northern destination. There were to be branch lines to Sheffield and Leeds. However Parliament reduced the scope of the project, and the Sheffield and Wakefield branches were removed from the scheme; the name was changed to the Great Northern Railway. The authorised network was therefore to be a main line to York: 186 miles, and a loop line from Peterborough to Bawtry via Boston and Lincoln: 86 miles; in addition there were some short branches in the south.Charles H Grinling, History of the Great Northern Railway, 1845 ‚Äì 1895, Methuen and Co, London, 1898, pages 21, 56 and 57John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume I: Origins and Development, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , page 14 The directors were elated to have received authorisation for their line after a considerable Parliamentary struggle, but were dismayed to have lost the Yorkshire branches, which they considered commercially important. They set about securing alternative means of serving the lost areas. Wrottesley elaborates: > The GN itself failed to gain independent access to Leeds only because of an > error in the levels, as the [Parliamentary] Committee felt the GN should > have its line, and rejected competing schemes of the Midland and the Leeds & > Dewsbury. This disappointment was somewhat offset by the assured success of > the Leeds Central station Bill, which [became] an Act until 22 July 1848, to > which was scheduled the running power agreement between the GN and M&L; > [Manchester and Leeds Railway]. The capital was ¬£320,000, equally provided > by the four companies [that were to build the station jointly]... The M&L; > had just changed its name to the Lancashire & Yorkshire.Wrottesley, volume > I, page 27 The Board decided to concentrate actual construction at first on the East Lincolnshire section of its future network, so that the early beginnings in Yorkshire were, for some time, remote from the rest of the emerging GNR system.Wrottesley volume I, page 21 Doncaster to Leeds Wakefield, and from there Leeds, had been lost, but there were ways that GNR Trains could reach them. Those centres were so important that urgent efforts were made to get access to them. In October 1846 the Great Northern Railway joined with the Leeds and Thirsk Railway, the Leeds and Dewsbury Railway, and the Manchester and Leeds Railway, to deposit a Parliamentary Bill for a joint Leeds Central station, to be built on the north side of the River Aire. The Bill was passed after a delay, in 22 July 1848, with capital of ¬£320,000. By this means the GNR secured a share in a Leeds terminal.Wrottesley volume I, pages 24 and 27 To reach Leeds from Doncaster, the GNR negotiated with the Manchester and Leeds Railway, (which was soon to be joined with others to form the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway), for running powers for GNR trains over part of its proposed line. An agreement was made on 1 May 1847 giving the GNR running powers from Askern (north of Doncaster) to Wakefield via Knottingley, and to Methley, where the M&LR; line would make a junction with the Midland Railway. In return, the agreement gave the M&LR; powers from Askern to Doncaster. The arrangement was ratified in the Leeds Central Act of 22 July 1848.David Joy, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume VIII: South and West Yorkshire, David & Charles Publishers, Newton Abbot, 1984, , page 208 Shaftholme Junction is where the present-day Knottingley line diverges from the East Coast Main Line. Edmund Denison is supposed to have stated in 1850 that the GNR ended \\"in a ploughed field\\" thereGrinling, page 96Grinling, page 141 However Shaftholme Junction did not exist until a later time, and the location of the end-on junction was Askern Junction, 264 yards further on, towards Knottingley.W J Scott, The Northern Termini of the Great Northern Railway, in the Railway Magazine January 1906 The GNR now negotiated with the Midland Railway for running powers over their line from Methley Junction to Leeds. The Midland Railway was controlled by George Hudson, the so-called Railway King. Hudson was a skilled financier, who used extremely underhand methods to get his way, and was later exposed and cast out of his positions of power. At this stage, however, Hudson was still reigning, and when Hudson signed an undertaking granting the GNR the running powers they sought, the GNR took him at his word. In exchange for the running powers, the GNR agreed not to lodge its intended Parliamentary Bill for a Leeds line.Wrottesley volume I, page 28Joy, page 41 Early in June 1848 the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway opened its Wakefield-Knottingley-Goole line, and it was ready to open the Knottingley-Askern junction section. The GNR line between Askern junction and Stockbridge (a short distance north of Doncaster) was ready, so the formal opening from Knottingley to Stockbridge was on 5 June 1848; public traffic commenced on the next day between Knottingley and Askern, and on the following day, over the GNR between Askern and Stockbridge, a distance of 2 miles 45 chains. The remainder, 2 miles 4 chains, from the Bentley road to a temporary station east of the Great North Road at Doncaster was opened on the following 5 August in time for the St Leger race meeting.Grinling, page 79Wrottesley, volume I, page 36 The L&YR; provided a service of five trains each way on weekdays and two each way on Sundays. The carrier Pickfords dealt with some goods traffic for the time being. This was a remote and disconnected section of the GNR, but the GNR started to operate some of the trains on the Doncaster to Knottingley line from August 1849. The Doncaster station had been makeshift, and a proper station, about a half mile north, was in use from mid-1851.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 43 and 44 Doncaster to Leeds operation started The GNR system in Yorkshire in 1849As construction proceeded further south, the GNR thought it was now in a position to start running trains between Peterborough and Leeds. The route as far north as Doncaster was very roundabout, via Boston and Lincoln. From Doncaster it was to be over the L&YR; between Askern junction and Methley junction, then over the Midland Railway to Gelderd RoadThe location is sometimes spelt Geldard Road. junction just outside Leeds; trains reversed there over a short section of the Leeds and Thirsk Railway to reach the Leeds Central station. The date set for the commencement of through running was 4 September 1849, once again because of the St Leger racing meeting at Doncaster. However, there was a setback; notwithstanding George Hudson's October 1847 agreement, the Midland Railway authorities now demanded that the GNR undertake to abandon forever any rights to apply for an independent line to Leeds. The GNR refused this extraordinary demand, and the Midland Railway authorities severed the junction at Methley on 3 September 1849 to prevent the running of the GNR trains. As a contemporary newspaper recorded, > The Superintendent at Doncaster, having heard it whispered that something > was going on at the junction of the Doncaster line with the Midland Railway > at Methley, sent over a special engine before the [planned excursion] trains > and found the servants of the Midland Company had removed the points at the > junction, so that had the train proceeded thither it would have inevitably > run off the road.Atrocious Conduct in a Railway Company, article in the > Doncaster Chronicle newspaper, recorded in Joy, page 113 Grinling's account of the event is much more prosaic: > some over-zealous officers of the former [Midland Railway] Company took the > high-handed action of pulling up the junction rails at Methley to prevent > these trains from running, and it was only by producing their agreement with > King Hudson and threatening legal proceedings that the Great Northern > authorities got them replaced in time. This done, however, the Company was > able to profit considerably by the race-going excursionists.Grinling, page > 86 It was not until 1 October that the Midland Railway relented, and GNR trains ran to Leeds by their route. In 1849 the GNR decided to use a separate station at Leeds to save money, and it told the three other companies in the joint Central Station scheme that it would withdraw. In March 1850 a contract for building the separate station and an engine shed was let. The transfer to the new \\"Low Level\\" station took place on 14 May 1850. Barnsley over the South Yorkshire Railway The South Yorkshire Railway (formally known as the South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway) was authorised on 22 July 1847 to build from Doncaster to Barnsley. The GNR were given running powers over it.Wrottesley volume I, page 27 It opened its line from Swinton to a triangular junction south of Doncaster station on 10 November 1849, and later extended its line to Barnsley on 1 January 1851. Taking advantage of the running powers, the GNR ran a passenger service between Doncaster and Barnsley; there were four trains each way on weekdays only.Wrottesley, volume I, page 45 Reaching York In June 1850 the GNR reviewed its plans for reaching York. It was reaching Knottingley over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. The York and North Midland Railway was on the point of completing a short line from Knottingley to Burton Salmon, which gave access there to the Y&NMR;'s own line on to York. The GNR was already over-extended in capital account, and its own line to York had not been started. A debate centred around the alternative of building the line, or of making alliances with the Y&NMR.; The latter option prevailed, and on 6 June 1850 agreement was reached with the Y&NMR; that the GNR would have the running powers to York that it needed, on condition that the GNR abandoned its intended railway to York.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 48 and 49Grinling, page 95 On 8 August 1850, GNR trains first began to run through to York from London Kings Cross (Maiden Lane), a distance of 210 miles.Wrottesley, volume I, page 54 Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway The GNR was running trains to and from Leeds, but it was an uncomfortable arrangement with awkward routing, and relying on a hostile competing company. The independent Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway was authorised by Parliament on 30 June 1852; it built a line between Leeds and Bradford, and gave onward access towards Halifax from near Bradford by running powers over the L&YR.; The Company was enthusiastically encouraged by the GNR, and the LB&HJR; opened its line, from Bradford to just outside Leeds station, on 1 August 1854. The GNR had running powers over the LB&HJR; line, and so was able to run through carriages from the south to Leeds, Bradford and Halifax. These services meant a considerable volume of additional traffic at Leeds, such that the Low Level station at Leeds would be far too cramped, and the decision was taken to move the terminus back in to the Central station.Wrottesley, volume I, pages 73, 92, 96 and 97 The station was built to last: Lawrence, writing in 1909, said \\"it was opened on August 4th, 1854, and is substantially the same now as it was then\\".H S Lawrence, The Great Northern Railway in the West Riding, in the Railway Magazine, October 1909 Gildersome and Batley branches When the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway was authorised, a branch from Laisterdyke, near Bradford, to Gildersome was included in the powers. In 1856 the Gildersome branch was opened, in fact as a through line connecting Laisterdyke and Ardsley. The continuation had been authorised by Act of 10 July 1854, to form a junction with the Bradford, Wakefield & Leeds, which had been authorised on the same day. The line formed a more direct route from Bradford to Wakefield and the south, albeit with difficult gradients.Wrottesley, volume I, page 97 In November 1864 the LB&HJR; network, supported heavily by the GNR, was further enhanced to connect to Batley, by a branch line from Adwalton Junction on the Gildersome line.Wrottesley, volume I, page 101  Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway The GNR sysytem in Yorkshire in 1857The GNR's access to West Yorkshire was further enhanced by the opening to the public on 5 October 1857 of the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Railway. Its line ran from Wakefield Kirkgate station to Holbeck junction, immediately south of Leeds. The new line enabled direct running into Leeds Central, avoiding the former reversal off the Leeds and Thirsk Railway; furthermore the route by-passed the Midland Railway. There was a triangular junction at Wortley, outside Leeds, enabling through running from Wakefield to Bradford. The GNR worked the line, and made use of running powers over the Halifax Junction company's line.Wrottesley, volume I, page 98Bairstow, page 6 Branch line to Ossett, and Batley The BW&LR; obtained an Act on 23 July 1860Ernest F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Wrottesley, volume I, pages 100 and 101 for a branch to Ossett. It was a single line, and left the main line at Wrenthorpe junction, just north of Wakefield. It reached an \\"Ossett\\" station at Flushdyke on 7 April 1862 and was extended to Ossett itself on 2 April 1864.Martin Bairstow, The Great Northern Railway in West Yorkshire, Wyvern Publications, Skipton, 1982, , page 63 The line was further extended to Batley, making a junction with the LB&HJR; there. The extension opened on 15 December 1864. In the 1863 session of Parliament the BW&LR; sought powers to change its name to the West Yorkshire Railway, and this was sanctioned by an Act of 21 July 1863. Methley joint line The BW&LR; obtained powers for a connecting branch line to Methley by an Act of 21 July 1863, giving running powers over the North Eastern Railway from Methley to Castleford. The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the North Eastern Railway were brought into joint ownership of the line, which became known as the Methley joint line, or the Methley Joint Railway.H C Casserley, Britain's Joint Lines, Ian Allan, Shepperton, 1968, , page 156 In 1865 the Methley Joint Railway was opened for goods traffic. It provided a useful west-east link between the GNR in the Leeds area, and the L&YR; and the North Eastern Railway in the Castleford area. A passenger service was run several years later. A south curve at Lofthouse was brought into use on 1 May 1876.John Wrottesley, The Great Northern Railway: volume II: Expansion and Competition, B T Batsford Limited, London, 1979, , pages 21 and 22 GNR takes over The Great Northern Railway had running powers over the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway, and operated the majority of the trains; and it worked the entire traffic of the Bradford, Wakefield and Leeds Junction Railway (now renamed the West Yorkshire Railway). In 1865 it acquired both of those companies; the one third share of the Methley Joint Railway also transferred to the GNR.Joy, pages 248 and 249Wrottesley, volume I, page 102 Coal The carriage of coal to London was a prime business for the Great Northern Railway, and the principal source was the South Yorkshire Coalfield. To some extent the coal owners there worked in concert, and were able to bring pressure to bear on the railways. Much of the output was loaded to the South Yorkshire Railway, but that line was also connected to the London and North Western Railway. In December 1861 the LNWR carried 74,953 tons against the combined GNR and Midland total (chiefly via Nottingham) of 42,843 tons. On 23 January 1863 the GNR signed the Coal Traffic Agreement, reducing tolls over the Midland Railway through Nottingham for the GNR but also for the Midland Railway south of Hitchin. In 1863 the GN carried 560,000 tons of coal to London, 770,000 tons in 1864, and 975,000s ton in 1865. It was considered that the increase would have been 25% greater in 1864 if the company had had sufficient engine power and siding accommodation.Wrottesley, volume I, page 159 West Riding and Grimsby Railway The GNR system in Yorkshire in 1866On 7 August 1862 the West Riding and Grimsby Railway was authorised. It was to connect Doncaster and Wakefield, with a short line from Adwick towards Stainforth, giving access to Grimsby. It was agreed that the line would be owned jointly by the GNR and the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The line from Doncaster to Wakefield opened on 1 February 1866 and the transfer to joint ownership took place on the same day.Joy, page 219 The Great Northern Railway network in West Yorkshire from 1866 The Great Northern Railway now, in 1866, had a direct route under its own (partly joint) control between Doncaster and Leeds and Bradford, and by running powers to Halifax. Shaftholme Junction to York The Great Northern Railway had resigned itself to reaching York via Knottingley over the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the York and North Midland Railway; the Y&NMR; had merged with others in 1854 to form the North Eastern Railway. The NER obtained powers on 23 June 1864 to construct a direct line from York through Selby to a junction with the GNR at Shaftholme junction, a quarter mile south of the end-on Askern junction. This spot became very well known later as the northern extremity of the GNR on the line to York.Of course the GNR lines in the Leeds and Bradford area, and some branches, are considerably further north. An agreement had been signed with the GNR on the previous 15 March, which arranged for the NER to have running powers from Askern to Doncaster. The GNR received running powers over the new route, and it was agreed that there should be no competition. Four GNR engines were to be out-stationed at York, and two NER engines at Doncaster.Wrottesley, volume I, page 162 The NER opened the line on 2 January 1871, and the GNR transferred its expresses and some slower trains to the new route, with a significant saving in journey time.Wrottesley, volume II, page 5 Dewsbury The Ossett and Batley line passed Dewsbury by, and the GNR decided to make a new line connecting Dewsbury into the system. A new line was opened to a temporary Dewsbury terminus station on 1 May 1874 (goods) and 9 September (passengers). A passenger service of 14 trains each way on weekdays and five each way on Sundays ran between Wakefield and Dewsbury. The intention had been to continue construction from Dewsbury to Batley, but the money market became very difficult, and the work was delayed. The line opened on 12 April 1880; there was a new through station at Dewsbury, and the temporary terminus became a goods station.Bairstow, page 10 Halifax and Ovenden Joint Line In the 1870s a scheme was put forward independently for a line from Halifax to Keighley. The terrain was exceptionally difficult, and because of concerns about practicality, the project was drastically cut back in Parliament to a short line from Halifax to Ovenden. This was made jointly with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and opened to goods traffic in 1874, and to passengers in 1879. In 1884 another very ambitious scheme was put forward for a line from Huddersfield to join a planned Hull and Barnsley Railway station in Halifax, and to run to the St Paul's district of the town. The Huddersfield connection was considered to be unaffordable, but the Halifax High Level Railway opened in 1890 connecting a new St Paul's station with Holmfield. In 1894 the company was absorbed by the GNR and L&YR; jointly, and the line was managed in common with the Halifax and Ovenden Joint Line.Alan Whitaker and Bob Cryer, The Queensbury Lines, Dalesman Books, year=1984, Shipley branch Bradford was a rapidly growing commercial conurbation, and residential travel facilities were in demand. In addition there were extensive mineral extraction activities between Bradford and Shipley, as well as offshoots of the textile industry. In 1866 the Bradford, Eccleshill and Idle Railway was authorised, and perhaps as an afterthought, the Idle and Shipley Railway was authorised in 1867, together forming a through line from Laisterdyke, forming a triangular junction there, immediately east of Bradford, to a connection with the Midland Railway at Shipley. In 1871 the Great Northern Railway took over the powers as financial difficulties had frustrated the two smaller companies' attempts to construct. The GNR itself delayed, but the line opened in stages from 1873 to 1875. The line was steeply graded, but nevertheless handled good volumes of goods and mineral traffic as well as a frequent passenger service.Wrottesley, volume II, page 18 Queensbury lines The GNR system in Yorkshire in 1888The Great Northern Railway built a group of railways in the area west of Bradford, north of Halifax and south of Keighley. The terrain was hilly and exceptionally difficult for railways, but there was industry in the districts, originally attracted by the availability of coal deposits that were now nearing exhaustion. The Great Northern Railway felt impelled to build in this region, largely for fear that the Midland Railway might do so, gaining access to GNR territory. Two railways were proposed independently, but both became sponsored by the GNR. The first was the Bradford and Thornton Railway, which made a triangular junction with the GNR Bowling line at Bradford, and ran via Queensbury to Thornton. It opened progressively from 1876. The Halifax, Thornton and Keighley Railway was next, connecting Holmfield, the northern extremity of the Halifax and Ovenden line, with Queensbury, where it made a triangular junction with the Bradford and Thornton Railway. In addition, it built on from Thornton to Keighley. These lines opened in stages between 1876 and 1884. The construction cost had been huge, and although business was encouraging, the line never paid for the first cost.Wrottesley, volume II, pages 61 and 63 Pudsey loop line When the Leeds, Bradford and Halifax Junction Railway had built its main line, it ran north of Pudsey, to avoid the difficult topography there. Pudsey was a large and growing industrial town, and eventually the GNR were pressured to connect it to the network. A line from Stanningley was opened in 1878 with a frequent shuttle train service. This was still unsatisfactory to local people, and in 1882 there was a rapprochement with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, which encouraged thoughts of establishing a new connection to Low Moor. In 1885 an Act was granted for an extension of the Pudsey loop line to the west to enhance the junctions near Laisterdyke, and connect the line towards Low Moor. At the east end the connection near Stanningley was to be reversed to allow direct running from Bramley through Pudsey to Bradford or Low Moor. This arrangement was inaugurated in December 1893, and enabled a long circular service from Leeds back to Leeds by way of this line and the L&YR; Spen Valley line.Wrottesley, volume II, page 61 East and West Yorkshire Union Railway The East and West Yorkshire Union Railway was sponsored by the Hull and Barnsley Railway, which hoped to get access over it to Leeds for passenger traffic. In fact the company never raised enough money, and its network was confined to colliery and quarry connections in the area around Rothwell, south-east of Leeds. It opened in 1890 and in 1904 attempted a passenger service from Rothwell over the Midland Railway to Leeds. The service was commercially unsuccessful and was soon discontinued. The line brought considerable volumes of coal to the GNR at Lofthouse Junction, but it remained independent until the Grouping of 1923.Joy, page 266 Hunslet Railway In the 1880s the Hunslet district of Leeds was experiencing considerable industrial growth. Proposed independently, the Hunslet Railway was authorised to build a line from Beeston to Hunslet, and the GNR adopted the authorisation. After some delay it was opened in 1899, by which time the North Eastern Railway had built its own branch to Hunslet. There were exchange sidings but no through running; passengers were never carried.Joy, pages 58 and 59 South Yorkshire Joint Railway The relatively shallow coal measures of the Yorkshire coalfield were becoming worked out, and in the first years of the twentieth century newer, much deeper, coal resources were being sought. When these became available, they needed rail access to transport the mineral to market, and after an initial period of disagreement, it emerged that a single jointly owned and operated railway was appropriate to serve the district. The result was the South Yorkshire Joint Railway, jointly owned by the Great Central Railway, the Midland Railway, the North Eastern Railway, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway and the Great Northern Railway. The main line started from Kirk Sandall Junction, not far short of Stainforth where the West Riding and Grimsby Joint Line met the Doncaster to Goole line. It ran through Dinnington to Brancliffe Junctions, near Shireoaks on the Sheffield to Retford line. It was about 17 miles long, having been authorised in 1902, and opened in 1909. Naturally the dominant traffic was coal, but passengers were carried from 1910.B J Elliott, The South Yorkshire Joint Railway, The Oakwood Press, Usk, 1972, , pages 12 to 15, 20, 28 and 29 The Grouping, and after The GNR system in Yorkshire in 1922The Railways Act 1921 determined that most of the railways of Great Britain would be reorganised into one or other of four new large companies, in a process known as the \\"grouping\\". The Great Northern Railway was to be a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway, the LNER. Some of the GNR's partners went with it, into the same group: the North Eastern Railway and the North British Railway, together forming the East Coast Main Line; and the Great Central Railway and the Hull and Barnsley Railway. The Great Eastern Railway also joined the LNER. Many of the secondary lines in Yorkshire were paralleled by companies that joined a rival company, the London Midland and Scottish Railway, LMS. Thus the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, and the Midland Railway were constituents of the LMS. Joint lines that were joint between companies in different groups remained joint, now between the LNER and the LMS. The competition for London to Scotland traffic, for haulage of coal from the Yorkshire coalfields to the south, and locally on many lines within Yorkshire, therefore continued. Electric tram competition in urban areas had already hit railway carryings hard; motor bus services were generally still in the future, but in time would seriously wound many rural passenger services. As roads were improved, partly funded by local authority rates levied on the railways, motor lorries would also abstract business from goods trains. The bright spots of the best long distance trains would be further improved under the LNER, and may be considered to be continuing to improve in the present day.David Wragg, LNER Handbook: The London and North Eastern Railway 1923 to 1947, Haynes Publishing, Sparkford, 2011, The present day Most of the former GNR branch lines in Yorkshire have been closed. The East Coast Main Line is a busy passenger and freight railway using the GNR route from London to Shaftholme Junction, and to Leeds.Leeds Central station has been closed. The old GNR route from Leeds to Mill Street Junction, just outside the current Bradford Interchange station, is in use as an important secondary passenger route.

(in French) Ultimately, the word originates from the Latin 'caecus' (blind) and the Greek 'gr√°mma' (Œ≥œÅŒ¨ŒºŒºŒ±; letter, thing written). In English, other designations exist.

Retrieved 2 October 2019.), Royal Mail uses 'articles for the blind', and the United States Postal Service uses 'free matter for the blind'.  Origin  Latin characters printed in ink. In the 1800s, the advent of tactile writing systems, like braille and moon type, saw the visually impaired gain greater access to literature. In these writing systems, characters are represented by embossed symbols, known as tactile characters, that are read by passing the fingertips over the paper. Printing tactile characters requires paper formats larger and heavier than those used in ink printing. Posting books that use tactile characters is therefore more expensive. To offset the burden of this cost from visually impaired persons, many national postal services have established measures to allow books for the visually impaired to be posted free of charge. In 1898, Canada became one of the first nations to implement such measures through legislation.Canada (Dominion of). An Act further to amend the Post Office Act, SC 1898 (61 Vict 1), c 20, s 4. Archived from the original on 3 October 2019. Retrieved 2 October 2019. In 1952, the Universal Postal Union moved to exempt post containing documents printed in tactile characters for the visually impaired from postage. Henceforth, all member states of the United Nations have been bound to honour this exemption. The term 'c√©cogramme' (cecogram) has been used by the UPU to designate such post officially since 1964.  Regulation  The internationally recognised cecogram label should be adhered to all cecograms. The Universal Postal Union officially defines what constitutes a cecogram on behalf of the international community. Modern cecograms may contain documents in paper and digital formats. These include texts printed with tactile characters, tactile graphics, audio CDs, flash drives and hard drives. Other items designed to assist persons dealing with challenges inherent to visual impairment, such as white canes and braille watches, may also be included in cecograms. Unlike ordinary letters and parcels, cecograms should be easy to open and close. The contents of cecograms are routinely inspected by postal workers in order to ensure that senders are not abusing the cecogram's exemption from postage. Including items in cecograms other than those expressly created for the visually impaired is prohibited. Cecograms may weigh up to .International Bureau of the Universal Postal Union.

At the time of introduction, the 250 cc class was considered a large capacity motorcycle. Overview When the 250 cc Raid was introduced at the 1956 Milan EICMA Motorcycle Show, it received considerable interest as a machine that \\"could cross a continent\\". The name, which in Italian means a long, fast and adventurous trip, was chosen following a survey of MV dealers. Production started in 1957, but sales of the 250 were not as good as expected. In an attempt to increase sales, a 300 cc version was introduced in 1959. MV attempted to sell a police version to the Guardia di Finanza with little success, and the Italian Armed Forces, who purchased the military version in limited numbers. Priced initially at 286,000 lira for the 250 cc and 290,000 lire for the 300 cc, the success hoped for was not realised with only 544 250 cc machines and about 500 300 cc machines being produced. Models =250 Raid= The initial 250 model was propelled by a 247 cc air-cooled, single- cylinder OHV engine. Bore and stroke was 69 x 66 mm and compression ratio was 7.2:1. Breathing through a 24 mm Dell'Orto carburettor, the engine produced 14 bhp (10.4 kW) at 5,600 rpm. A geared primary drive fed the power to a 4 speed gearbox. The frame was MV's usual arrangement of a double cradle made of tubular and pressed steel. Telescopic front forks were fitted and a swinging arm with hydraulic shock absorbers at the rear. 200 mm drum brakes were fitted front and rear. The machine was finished in black with red detailing. Top speed was 115 km/h (72 mph). =250 Raid Extra= The Raid Extra version was equipped with the same mechanical components as the Raid but had a higher specification finish. It was finished in red with white highlighting. =300 Raid= In 1959, in an attempt to recover the poor sales of the 250, a 300 cc version was introduced. The bore was increased to 74 mm and the stroke to 70 mm, which gave a 301 cc displacement and an output of 16 bhp (12 kW) at 5,000 rpm. To give a similar fuel consumption to the 250, the carburettor was reduced to 22 mm. A new petrol tank, mudguards and exhaust were fitted, otherwise the cycle parts were the same as the 250. =300 Raid Militaire= A special version, the 300 Raid Militaire, was produced in limited quantities for Italian Armed Forces in 1961. The model was fitted with two individual saddles and finished in a drab green. =300 Raid Polizia= Modified for police use, the 300 Raid Polizia was introduced, but this variant was not taken up by the police. Spanish production The 300 Raid was made under licence in Spain by MV Avello in the city of Gij√≥n in the autonomous community of Asturias. The model was marketed in Spain as the 300 Nal√≥n, the name of a local river. The Spanish model was the largest MV produced in Spain and used a different frame and differed in appearance from the Italian model. Production was from 1961 - 1966 (the 1966 models being supplied from old stock).

With the 1986 published and by Grant staged documentation on homelessness in the US under President Ronald Reagan, Down and Out in America, for which Feury and with his co-producer Milton Justice received an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature the following year. Going on to produce a number of documentary films as well as TV Movies based on the documentaries. The socially engaged documentary film project: his production Baghdad ER took a look at the activities of US military surgeons in the Iraq war zone. Baghdad ER, produced in conjunction with DCTV, HBO, and his longtime collaborators Roberta Morris Purdee and wife Lee Grant. The film went on to win four Emmys, a Peabody, and the Dupont-Columbia. In 2012, Joseph Feury began to professionally paint and also worked as draftsman. His works have been exhibited in galleries in Manhattan and across the United States. Grant colleagues such as Alan Alda, Joy Behar and Michael Douglas, a close friend of Feury's for decades, own works by Feury. His complete oeuvre was published in a book entitled \\"Artworks of Joseph Fioretti\\". In October 2019 Feury received a retrospective of his artwork at the National Arts Club in New York City.https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Photo-Flash-Stars-Align-For- Oscar-Winner-Joseph-Feurys-New-Exhibit-At-The-National-Arts- Club-20191016https://hollywoodlife.com/pics/hottest-celebrity-pics-this-week- oct-21-27/michael-douglas-taylor-a-purdee-catherine-zeta-jones-rachel-jones-2/  Filmography  Producer of Television and Movies unless otherwise stated * 1969: Peyton Place (TV series, actor only) * 1970: The Pleasure Game * 1971: The Jesus Trip * 1976: The Stranger (short film) * 1983, 1989, 1992: America Undercover (Documentary Series) * 1984: A Matter of Sex (also screenplay participation) * 1986: Nobody's Child * 1986: Down and Out in America (documentary) * 1989: Staying Together * 1989: No Place Like Home * 1994: Decision of the Heart (Seasons of the Hart) * 1995: Last Summer in the Hamptons (as an actor) * 1997: Say It, Fight It, Cure It * 1993‚Äì2004: Intimate Portrait (TV documentary series) * 2005: Going Shopping (as an actor) * 2005: ...

He is affiliated with the Republican Party, and was elected a member of the Georgia House of Representatives in 2018. Erwin represents the 28th district, which covers the entirety of Banks County and Stephens County, as well as the eastern region of Habersham County in northeast Georgia. Pre-political career Before becoming a representative, Erwin was a business director for Carroll Daniel Construction Company, and a school administrator in Carroll and Henry counties. He was the superintendent of the Banks County School System for eleven years. Erwin was named Banks County Citizen of the Year in 2006, and was voted Georgia School Superintendent of the Year in 2013.  Political career  Erwin initially defeated incumbent Dan Gasaway in a close election in the May 22, 2018 Republican primary. Gasaway challenged the results, claiming that there were votes cast outside of the district for the election. Stacey Abrams cited the election as an example of election fraud under Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp, her opponent in the 2018 Georgia gubernatorial election. A judge for Banks County ruled in favor of Gasaway's challenge and a special election was held on December 4, 2018. Erwin won the race by a closer margin of two votes. After being sworn in as the new representative, Erwin was temporarily removed from the House, due to a court order allowing Gasaway to challenge the results again. A final election was held April 9, 2019, in which Erwin won with 75% of the vote.

BCSS are built upon persuasive systems design techniques.  Underlying theories and models  The design of these systems and their contents are based on behavioral change theories and models for behavioral change over time. The theory of planned behavior describes the relationship between attitudes, intentions, and the desired behavior. It is considered to be one of the most influential determinant models. A supporting model is the Fogg Behaviour Model (FBM), which states that a user must be motivated first before having the ability to perform the change in their behavior, which is triggered by either intrinsic or extrinsic factors (The term \\"trigger\\" was changed by the author in late 2017 and the term \\"prompt\\" is now being used). BCSS makes use of extrinsic (perceptual) prompts like alarms, messages with offers or calls to action, ads, requests, and more. Other theories that aid in the design and mechanisms behind a BCSS include the social learning theory (SLT), which studies the interactions between a user and the environment, and the theory of planned behavior (initiated as the theory of reasoned action).  Techniques and elements  Applications of BCSS may include game and training elements in several market domains which can range from Health and Education and Quality of Life (QoL), to professional development and workability. Virtually any concept designed to cause a shift in a person's behavior can be considered a BCSS, even if this change is not directly observed by the users. When users are aware of this intention and choose to work within the system, the chances of favorable results from this system increase. This effect is attributed to metacognition, as most BCSS systems implement metacognitive strategies for goal attainment. These strategies help users understand the cause of their resistance to adopting the desired behavior. It requires that they monitor themselves whenever the targeted behavior can be observed to understand their progress towards the desired behavior, and record evidence (usually objective but also subjective measurements) of their behavioral changes. There can be a positive impact on people who have difficulties in changing their behavior by considering behaviors and the distance to the desired behavior. This can be achieved by helping them develop a personalized plan for reaching the targeted behavior and learning the ways to achieve their personal goals. In most cases, the general objective can be split into more than one objective or step, before the desired behavior is adopted by the users and becomes a routine. The positive feedback introduces self-management in BCSS applications since it is particularly helpful for people to take responsibility for their own actions and do things to the best of their ability. BCSS is very often equipped with additional features like game elements to foster user engagement leading to serious game applications. Moreover, they implement machine learning techniques to predict the future behavior of users based on their past performance. The evidence of the achieved change in behavior, as well as important notifications during self-evaluation, are communicated with visual analytics tools such as performance graphs. Additional tools frequently found in BCSS include checklists and questionnaires to collect users' feedback, hardware sensing components like the Internet of things (IoT) devices (e.g., cameras), and social collaboration to help the members of a user community to support each other. Occasionally, some BCSS allow professionals (trainers, educators, medical personnel and social professionals) to participate in the BCSS activities. This can be done by giving advice and support and also by making decisions and alterations to the treatment plan according to the observed performance and the personal needs of the targeted users.  Taxonomies  Most BCSSes work on a single profile (targeted user), while some can monitor and report progress made by a group of people. There are BCSS applications purely made using software, while others include hardware components like sensors and IoT devices to introduce physical computing in a hybrid physical-digital approach. The devices used to access a BCSS are usually internet-connected mobile devices like smartphones, tablets, or smartwatches. The success in this category of BCSS applications lies in monitoring and notifying the users constantly in regards to daily activities. On the other hand, there are BCSSes which are less intrusive and rely on less frequent access to the system. Another way to distinguish BCSSes is by the knowledge domain they refer to. Theoretically, a BCSS can be built in any knowledge domain.  Knowledge domains  = eHealth/mHealth = Examples of BCSS applied in eHealth domains include CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD, which is a community-based intervention to support people living with dementia and their caregivers using game elements to engage users in non-pharmacological interventions; iLift, which trains nurses in lifting and transfer techniques to prevent lower-back injuries, and We4Fit which is more like a game environment. A more extensive review of health BCSS can be found on the work of Alah√§iv√§l√§ & Oinas-Kukkonen (2016) and Bridle et al. (2005). = Education = As Arlinghaus and Johnston implied, ‚ÄúAlthough not sufficient, education is a necessary component for behaviour change‚Äù (2018). BCSSes are used in education less for imparting knowledge and testing knowledge gained, and more for teaching a difficult subject like \\"responsible sexual behaviour\\" in middle-school students, or for changing attitudes and beliefs about a topic of interest. Adopting new behavioral patterns is difficult and people are not motivated to change their behavior if they do not recognize the blocking issue. Gamification is used to help recognition by providing rewards, competition, and motivational cues of a BCSS. Prochaska et al. (2007) proposed a six-stage behavioral change model (pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance, and termination) which can be applied in educational uses of a BCSS, as it appears in an ideal environment for making the first step (contemplation) after a long period of resistance (pre- contemplation). BCSSes affect the physical world and help people experiment with an alternative behavioral pattern without thinking of possible coincidences (such as social exposure). The virtual activities performed in a BCSS help in the next step (preparation) where the user makes a transition from a passive to an active state in a safe environment. The user-monitoring and reward system of a BCSS helps users complete the rest of the stages of the behavior change (action, maintenance, and termination) and avoid regression to the previous unwanted behavior. Schmied (2017) proposes a similar seven-step process: the Designing for Behaviour Change (DBC) framework. Overall, a positive behavioral change in education settings is facilitated by technology through digital intervention strategies, where a teacher or educator makes adjustments to personalize the interventions to the student's profiles and performance. Although ICT tools may not be necessary to change behavior in schools, when used in the form of serious game-assisted learning, they can provide a more in-depth perception of important concepts in a field of study despite some disadvantages. = Other Domains = BCSS has been applied in other knowledge and study areas, including workers' behaviour, consumers' brand-loyalty, and CO2 footprints and energy consumption. Examples include applications designed to raise water-saving awareness, apps used by drivers to reduce fuel consumption by adopting an eco-friendly driving style, and educational games for simulating energy consumption in domestic environments like in Casals et al. (2017). A systematic review of the application of game elements to behavioural change in domestic energy consumption can be found in Johnson et al. (2017) An example from the Industry 4.0 domain is SATISFACTORY, which proposes a gamified social collaboration platform that is integrated into the shop-floor of industries to improve productivity, safety and workers' engagement. In the marketing context, behavioural change techniques do not aim to change the way people think, but how they consume products and services. In politics, behavioural change interventions are delivered in the form of mass- media campaigns on existing social media platforms rather than standalone applications. Overall, there is a continually growing number of domains in which ICT tools are introduced as tools to implement and deliver behavioral change campaigns in a systematic way. Some researchers refer to persuasive technology to identify the computer-mediated communication between humans or human-computer interaction technologies used to deliver persuasive evidence. A BCSS should be treated as a more complex ICT-based construct which may use persuasive technologies, but also supports the full life-cycle of behavioral change interventions (from authoring to publishing), implements various campaigns to achieve its goals, and is adaptive to specific user profiles.  Criticism  Behavior Change Support Systems have been criticized for a lack of grounding in independent behavioral theory, as well as the lack of industry standards to measure performance or effect. Another source of criticism refers to the dominant behavioral change models as products of the theory of planned behavior. According to some researchers (Kollmus & Agyeman, 2002), there is a gap between attitude and intention, and target behavior. Thus, it is difficult to find a widely accepted model that can take all relevant behavioral parameters into account. Additionally, even if BCSSes help to effect a change in a targeted user's behavior, the user usually fails to maintain the target behavior. This could be the result of underestimating the long-term influence that environmental factors have on behavior. There is currently an open discussion on how intrusive a BCSS should be, but this appears to be dependent upon the physical and social context of the environment in which the BCSS is being used. As BCSS makes use of personal data coming from users' profiles and the user-monitoring system, the use of BCSSes in everyday life may be legally restricted.

Early life Richard James Barrington was the son of Maj. Gen. Hon. John Barrington and the former Elizabeth Vassal. His father, the Governor of Berwick, died in Paris in 1764. His paternal grandparents were John Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington and Anne Daines (a daughter and co-heiress of Sir William Daines MP, Mayor of Bristol). His uncle was William served as the Chancellor of the Exchequer and became the 2nd Viscount Barrington. Other uncles were Daines Barrington, a lawyer, antiquarian and naturalist; Rear-Admiral Samuel Barrington of the Royal Navy; and Shute Barrington who became Bishop of Salisbury and Bishop of Durham. His maternal grandparents were Florentius Vassall, a wealthy planter and slave-owner, and Mary Foster (a daughter of Col. John Foster of Jamaica). Career Upon the death of his uncle, the 2nd Viscount Barrington, who had no surviving children, his elder brother William became the 3rd Viscount in 1793. William had married Anne Murrell, a daughter of John Murrell of Thetford Abbey, but had no children. Therefore, after his brother's death in 1801, Richard became the 4th Viscount Barrington and inherited Beckett House at Shrivenham in the English county of Oxfordshire (formerly in Berkshire). Personal life In 1783, Barrington was married to an American, Susan Budden (d. 1830), a daughter of Capt. William Budden and Louisa Cuzzins Budden, of Philadelphia. They had no children. In 1785, American portrait painter Gilbert Stuart painted a portrait of Barrington's uncle, Admiral Samuel Barrington, in London. Stuart later painted a portrait of the 4th Viscount ‚Äì1794. Lord Barrington died, without issue, on 8 December 1813 in at Valenciennes, France. He was succeeded in the Viscountcy by his younger brother, George.

Until 1992, the status of the Caspian was regulated by the Soviet-Iranian treaties. After the collapse of the USSR, emerging independent states, such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, raised the issue of dividing the Caspian Sea. Although meetings with representatives of the coastal states on how to settle the status of the Caspian Sea aimed to make a final decision, this was not possible, and there was a need to discuss the issue at the Summit. During these talks, the meeting held in Ashgabat on April 22‚Äì23, 2002 was of historical importance. The summit drew attention to 2 main aspects: 1) For the first time, the Caspian littoral states discussed the issues related to the Caspian Sea as a whole, and 2) For the first time, the Ashgabat summit included a search for a compromise between the heads of all coastal states on the status of the Caspian.  I Caspian Summit  On April 23‚Äì24, 2002, the first summit of the Caspian states was held in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. The Summit of the heads of Caspian littoral states with the participation of Presidents Heydar Aliyev (Azerbaijan), Saparmurat Niyazov (Turkmenistan), Mohammad Khatami (Iran), Nursultan Nazarbayev (Kazakhstan) and Vladimir Putin (Russia) was the first summit. At the closed meeting Russia, Azerbaijan, and Kazakhstan defended the sharing of offshore fields along the middle line and the shared use of the sea surface. On the other hand, Turkmenistan has created differences of opinion by supporting the argument of the division of the Caspian Sea. At the same time, the President of Turkmenistan reiterated that no one should use force in the Caspian Sea, incite conflicts or disputes, and all disputes should be resolved through negotiations. At this Summit, the heads of Caspian littoral states expressed their views on the legal status of the Caspian Sea for the first time.  II Caspian Summit  The second summit of the Caspian littoral states was held in Tehran on October 16, 2007. At the end o the summit a Declaration was signed by the heads of the Caspian littoral states. The Declaration consisted of 25 items. The Declaration recorded that geopolitical and national developments and processes in the Caspian region\\" should be taken into account by Caspian littoral states. At the same time, the existing agreements between the five states and, therefore, the need to improve the legal regime of the Caspian Sea and to adopt the \\"Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea.\\" was recorded.  III Caspian Summit  The 3rd Caspian Summit was held on November 18, 2010 in Baku. The heads of Caspian littoral states signed an agreement on the cooperation on the security in the Caspian Sea. The document included the norms and principles of international law, independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity, inviolability of borders, non-use of force. Article 1 of the agreement states that the security of the Caspian Sea is the exclusive right of the littoral states.  IV Caspian Summit  On September 29, 2014, the forth Caspian Summit was held in Astrakhan. the Caspian littoral states discussed the legal status, security, biological resources and environmental problems of the Caspian Sea. At the end of the summit, presidents signed agreements covering the cooperation in the field of hydro-meteorology of the Caspian Sea, and on prevention and elimination of consequences of the Caspian Sea, protection and rational use of the Caspian Sea water resources.  V Caspian Summit  The 5th Caspian Summit was held in Aktau in 2018. At this summit the parties signed a Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea. The document states that the waters of the Caspian littoral countries are 15 miles. The surface water is universal. However, most of the bio-resources of the Caspian Sea remain in common use. The presidents signed 8 documents including the Convention on the Legal Status of the Caspian Sea, the Protocol on Cooperation in Combating Terrorism in the Caspian Sea and other documents. These documents include cooperation on the fight against organized crime, economics and trade, transport, resolution of the conflicts, and border agencies.

He founded the Trans People of Color Coalition in 2010. In 2012, he became the first trans person to testify in front of the United States Senate when he spoke in support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. He was a long-time professor of business law and workplace discrimination at Lincoln University, a historically black college.  Early life and education  Broadus was born August 28, 1963 in Fayette, Missouri to Fannie and William. His parents were the children of slaves and suffered under the Jim Crow laws in Missouri. He spent most of his life near Columbia, Missouri. Kylar Broadus graduated from Fayette High School and earned a Bachelor of Science in business administration at Central Methodist University.  Career  Broadus worked for a large financial institution in the early 1990s. In 1995, he announced he was going to undergo gender transition. This resulted in Broadus facing a constructive discharge notice in 1997 after facing workplace harassment and discrimination. He was unemployed for a year after and suffered posttraumatic stress disorder from the harassment. For 18 years, Broadus worked in a private law practice in Columbia, Missouri where he represented LGBT clients in family and criminal law. He taught business law and workplace discrimination at Lincoln University for nearly 20 years where he served as chair of the business department. Broadus served on the National LGBTQ Task Force as senior public policy counsel. He was the director of the force's Transgender Civil Rights Project. Broadus was the state legislative manager and counsel for the Human Rights Campaign. From 2007 to 2010, he was board chair of the National Black Justice Coalition. In 2010, Broadus founded the Trans People of Color Coalition. In 2012, Broadus was one of thirteen transgender delegates at the Democratic National Convention. That year, he became the first openly transgender person testify to the United States Senate when he spoke of his support of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. He was interviewed in The Book of Pride. He was present next to President Obama during the signing of a 2014 executive order regarding further amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity, to protect LGBT employees from workplace discrimination.

Furthermore, Matar has been a part of 50 plus conferences around the world. Linda first starting fighting towards Lebanese gender equality, when she began working in a silk factory at the 12 years old.  Biography  Linda first realized the injustices towards Lebanese workers in society at age 12, when she stopped going to school to work in a silk factory. On top of work, Matar had to attend classes at night to provide financially for her parents. Linda then, at age seventeen, got married. It is also suggested that Linda had kids as well. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization held a tribute to honor Linda Matar's achievements, where she thanked her kids for their support. She also apologized for not being an attentive mother, as she was more invested in her work, rather than her kids. Later, at 90 years old, Matar had 8 great- grandchildren, 8 grandchildren, and 3 children.  Work  Along with the fact that Linda worked in a silk factory, where she witnessed first-hand inequality among women, an event that took place when she was 28 also triggered her urge to end Lebanese inequality. In 1952, Matar also witnessed her epileptic neighbor get picked up to go vote at a nearby polling station. The neighbor was a man, who had both mental and physical disabilities. However, because she is a women, she was not allowed to vote, despite having no disabilities. This is when Linda Matar decided to start being an activist for Lebanese women's rights. She also wanted to demolish laws that went against those rights. Linda first became a regular member of the League of Lebanese Women's Rights. Later, she moved up to Secretary General. Then finally president of the League of Lebanese Women's Rights in 1978. Then in 1980, Linda introduced a list of laws in which Lebanese women and men would be fully equal. She proposed that women and men would be equal in all laws concerning family status, inheritance, and criminal laws. Furthermore, Linda was the co-founder of multiple, private Lebanese women's organizations. She also represented Lebanese women's rights in over 50 conferences around the world. One conference Linda Matar attended, in 1995, was the World Conference on Women in Beijing. Another, in 1975, was the UN conference on women in Mexico. In 1996, Linda became the president of the Lebanese Council of Women, resigning in 2000. Linda was also received acknowledgement of her achievements, by Maire Claire, a French Magazine, when she was voted as one out of one hundred Women Who are Moving the World.

The hypothesis starts with the observation that some regions of the genome are more likely to preserve mutations into the next generation than others. This difference in the observed rate of mutation means some regions of the genome appear to mutate faster than others, and is theorized to relate to balancing the preservation of vital information relating to a species' function against its ability to mutate and adapt to new environmental niches. According to the hypothesis, these regions of the genome eventually drift into two rough categories: faster-mutating sections tuned to respond quickly to environmental pressures and allow adaptive radiation, as well as slower- mutating sections involved in an organism's most fundamental instructions. The maximum genetic diversity hypothesis asserts that only slow-mutating genes accurately reflect shared evolutionary history, relationships between species can alternatively be calculated by their \\"maximum genetic diversity,\\" which is determined by measuring the frequency of mutations in specific corresponding regions of orthologous genes instead of using raw overall genetic similarity. Using calculations based on mutations in these slow-mutating genes provides a chart of genetic ancestry that lines up with the fossil record ‚Äì measurements based on raw genetic similarity yield results that clash with the fossil record. Also due to this grouping into fast and slow, it is proposed that over time complex organisms become genetically fragile and less tolerant to mutation as their genetic diversity decreases, since an increasing proportion of their genome will have become slow-mutating over time. The hypothesis asserts that this is because increased organismal and social complexity means more of the genome is needed to preserve the expanding instructional manual necessary for complex behavior and function, and so more of an organism's genome must become slow-mutating as the organism increases in complexity, since being slow-mutating preserves and protects those vital instructions. Furthermore, beyond the fact that the hypothesis is still relatively unknown, it also contradicts the current paradigm in molecular evolution, since the neutral theory's fundamental premises are still nearly ubiquitously utilized in genetic analysis and admixture studies. Additionally, some of the phenomena explained by the hypothesis could theoretically be accounted for by other processes such as gene conversion or concerted evolution. Lastly, even if the neutral theory is disproved, it does not necessarily validate the hypothesis, as alternative theories have been proposed that also incorporate the effects of selection on the genome. Overview According to the maximum genetic diversity hypothesis, modern evolutionary theory becomes an interplay between short-term microevolution which follows the neutral theory's expectation of random but predictable rate of linear change, and longer-term macroevolution that cannot be timed with the same clock as microevolution since diversification can flow in punctuated fits and starts over long periods of time when a complex species disperses into an array of diverse environmental niches. As this occurs, the hypothesis predicts that each population will preserve the slow-mutating section of its genome which holds its most fundamental instructions from mutations, but quickly preserve mutations at sites that provide greater environmental fitness depending on the pressures of each unique niche. Support for this supposition is provided by a genetic model that seeks to solve the inconsistencies between the way regions of proteins seem to mutate in unison and the speed at which that happens, which observed that mutations seem to occur in \\"avalanches\\" that drastically alter not only specific regions of the genome as commonly assumed, but also only for short periods of time, using modeling to create a model of evolutionary change. The fact that some genomic regions preserve mutations at different rates than others can be demonstrated when any three species separated by significant evolutionary time are compared two at a time: each pair can have aligned overlapping genomic positions in orthologous proteins where mutations get preserved at a far higher rate than the neutral theory's random drift statistically allows. Additionally, these overlapping regions not only have higher mutation rates, they are also less likely to be involved with an organism's fundamental instructions within the maximum genetic diversity framework. This is supported by the observation that the higher percentage of active-coding exons a species has, the lower percentage of overlapping sites it will have ‚Äì species with more of their genome designated for active-coding exons ‚Äì stretches of nucleotides that are used by RNA to create proteins ‚Äì have a lower proportion of high-mutation overlapping sites, and vice versa. Since an organism's fundamental genomic structure can be traced by the maximum possible diversity of observed mutations in orthologous genes shared with a given sister species, measuring evolutionary and genomic distance is not done universally under this theory: instead the unit of measurement for each pairing is set by the maximum genetic diversity of an orthologous gene shared by the species. The simpler of any two organisms then sets this quantity, which will always be independent of both mutation rates and time. Calculations derived from the neutral theory result in the false conclusion that fish are equidistant to every single evolutionarily ascending species: the same distance from homo sapiens as to snake, and from ox to rabbit, rat, pig and tiger and boar. Calculations using the hypothesis yield results that capture the branching and punctuated nature of speciation, preserve its gradual increasing fractal complexity over time, and are consistent with patterns of speciation deduced from the fossil record. History Since the 1960s, when the term was popularized by Richard Lewontin, the amount of genetic diversity in populations was accepted to tick steadily at a rate timed by a molecular clock set by the mutation of a hemoglobin protein in most vertebrates, which was first calculated by Emanuel Margoliash. This conclusion, that genetic diversity would accumulate within a population indefinitely over time, was reached because it was assumed that every population's genome would continually accumulate mutations as time passed ‚Äì and so the more mutations that were observed the more basal and older a population was assumed to be since there was thought to be no upper limit as to how many mutations could accumulate. Timing this presumably stable and universal rate of mutation and hence diversity using the molecular clock was first theorized by Motoo Kimura, but popularized by √âmile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling. It was assumed to regulate all genetic variation both within and between species. Subsequently, the neutral theory and molecular clock were used in a variety of settings, most notably in phylogenetics, or the study of how different species change and pass on traits over time. Many measurements that are nearly ubiquitous in population genetics, such as the fixation index, are also based on the molecular clock. However, since its inception there have been points against the neutral theory and its molecular clock's fundamental assumptions, such evidence that they may be affected by natural selection. Despite this, the molecular clock was assumed to regulate all orthologous genes inherited from a common ancestor, and used to set the historic rate of speciation across the animal kingdom, as well as answer questions around the evolutionary and genetic relationships between species. Despite its widespread use, the molecular clock can encounter a ten-fold rate of error depending on whether dates are being assessed within or before the past two million years, and a twenty-fold rate of error within the same time-frame depending on exactly which way the molecular clock is applied. Additionally, it has been argued that there is no independent evidence to support the molecular clock's premise that all species have similar mutation rates, and the neutral theory fails to note and explain the common occurrence of overlapping mutations: where mutations in independently evolving species occur at orthologous overlapping protein positions at a rate too high to be neutral. the hypothesis provides a framework for the genetic equidistance phenomenon, and it appears to align findings derived from predictable genomic patterns that have been observed in simple organisms like yeast all the way up to the most complex, homo sapiens. Contrary to Emanuel Margoliash's original assumption that genetic distance could be universally determined by the rate of mutation in a blood protein, and then calculated for all life on earth by time alone \\\\- meaning that all mutations on earth were set by that protein and had a biologically universal rate that is constant and steady - the genetic equidistance phenomenon could also be explained by the assumption that mutation-rates are specific to each gene and might vary across species and within populations. In 2008, a cancer researcher, Shi Huang, then a faculty member at the Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Research Institute in La Jolla California and since 2009 at South Central University China, independently discovered the genetic equidistance phenomenon and first published a preprint describing the Maximum Genetic Diversity theory in 2008, which was published as a peer-reviewed book chapter later that year. Fast and slow Because simpler organisms are less likely to be affected at all by any one single-base mutation in their exons, or functionally active coding stretches of their genome, the hypothesis considers them to be more genetically robust than more complex organisms whose genomes are less tolerant to mutation and so are thought to be more fragile. It is theorized that in complex organisms that depend on myriad interconnected networks of proteins and regulation, there is far less margin for error since the odds that a substitution will create an erroneous and detrimental base- change in a crucial stretches of the genome increase as more DNA sequences and their subsequent proteins are needed in additional fine-tuned cell-types and epigenetic functions. Like interspersed series of genetic capstones, these stretches of code become relatively less tolerant to mutation and will appear to be mutating more slowly when compared to faster-mutating less-fundamental regions of the genome according to the hypothesis. One example of this is the observation that mtDNA is not selectively neutral ‚Äì meaning that certain versions of its alleles are much more beneficial than others ‚Äì since its average diversity holds across all animal phyla, capturing mtDNA's comparatively slower rate of mutation and intrinsic functional importance. The hypothesis asserts that as organismal and social complexity grows, the need to preserve the fundamental structure of an organism ‚Äì the most basal directions involved in the most basic development and functions which mutate more slowly ‚Äì becomes balanced against the need to be able to adapt to increasing numbers of environmental pressures and challenges ‚Äì done by faster-mutating regions that respond adaptively to environmental pressures. The hypothesis states that the variability in the rate of change causes evolutionary selective pressures to sort alleles into two rough groups: slow-mutating ones involved with an organism's most basic structure and function, and fast-mutating ones that respond quickly in order to increase the odds a beneficial mutation occurs and is preserved. As time passes and a species increases in complexity, it is theorized that a greater proportion of its genome becomes slow-mutating as a greater amount of information becomes needed to preserve a more complex organism's fundamental development and behavior. And with a larger proportion of its genome dedicated to intrinsic instructions, the species is considered to be more genetically fragile. Intertwined evolutionary effects Under the hypothesis, as organisms increase in complexity population-wide genetic diversity is regulated by the need to maintain a harmonious balance between those two broad categories: fast-mutating alleles that adapt quickly to the pressure of a given environment, and slow-mutating ones that preserve the most fundamental and basal instructions for the organism. Maintaining this balance means that simpler organisms will have a higher percentage of their genome able to tolerate mutational change, since simple means less-complex biological and epigenetic processes that are more tolerable to change than those of more and genomically delicate complex organisms according to the hypothesis. As organismal complexity increases, the margin for genomic error narrows and toleration for new mutations shrinks since within the framework higher-order life means more complex cellular mechanisms and more fragile biological processes. The hypothesis suggests that maximum population-wide genetic diversity can increase up to a point that is set by the physiological and epigenetic complexity of the organism and its environmental interactions, but past that maximal fitness is decreased because the level of mutation becomes maladaptive by deleteriously altering an organism's fundamental instructions. Having less than the maximum and ideal level of genetic diversity means poor adaptive capacity to respond to changing environmental pressures under the hypothesis, and higher than the ideal maximum means damage to the basic physiology of the organism because its most basal instructions become damaged. The hypothesis proposes that a population will have the most evolutionary success when its diversity level is properly tuned to its environment, and when the levels of its slow- and fast-mutating alleles are optimally balanced. The slow clock The hypothesis calculates the time and amount of genetic divergence between species by first randomly picking a statistically- significant set of orthologous genes shared between any three macroevolutionary-distant species. Genes are sorted as either fast or slow after the alignment of two more closely related species' orthologous genes alongside the third less-related species. If no amino-acid positions overlap, meaning they share a mutation at a given position, the gene is assigned a score of 0. For genes with any overlapping amino-acid positions at all, the higher that count of overlapping positions the faster mutating the gene is considered to be. Since there is no hard ratio necessary to measure maximum genetic diversity, the genes would then be sorted into roughly half slow- mutating and half fast-mutating. In any group of species A, B, and C ‚Äì with A the most complex and C the least ‚Äì just because A and B might appear closer to each other as far as their entire genomes are considered, that does not necessarily mean they can be grouped together, and C considered an outgroup. To chart their genetic relationships, only the distances between slow-evolving genes can be used under maximum genetic diversity. Only when both A and B are the same distance away from C measured by their slow-evolving genes can they be considered a separate clade. The \\"slow clock\\" is based on reports that using the molecular clock derived from the neutral theory to time species divergence can be off by up to a factor of twenty, depending on whether a single unchanging species is being used or an inter-species comparison is being made. The hypothesis holds that the molecular clock can still be used to accurately measure genetic diversity in relatively short time scales among similar species, while its accuracy fades when it is applied to windows over hundreds of thousands of years, and when applied to species with diverse phenotypic expression. Overlapping origin stories Starting from the fact that some regions of the genome preserve mutations faster than others, the approach builds an explanatory framework for the fact that population-wide genetic diversity does not always increase from small to large without an upper limit, something that must always happen under the neutral theory and its infinite site models which posit that over time a population will continue to accumulate mutations at a steady rate as time passes upwards to infinity and beyond. The hypothesis posits that when two populations have different genetic diversity levels, it does not necessarily mean that the population with lower genetic diversity is descended from the one with higher genetic diversity as implied by the neutral theory. Under the neutral theory's molecular clock, the most basal or older populations will always have the highest rate of diversity because existing first means more mutations would have had time to accumulate in their genome. However, higher overall genomic diversity may simply be due to having more fast-mutating alleles needed to deal with a wider array of environmental challenges, but since genetic distance can only be measured by slow-mutating genes, raw overall diversity rates alone should not to used to derive genetic relationships since slow- mutating genes may make up a minority of the genome. The fact that most broad phenotypic traits are regulated by multiple loci is also incompatible with the neutral theory, since it would be statistically unlikely for enough linkage disequilibrium to form across the genome if mutations were occurring randomly. The hypothesis accounts for this, since phenotypically linked fast-mutating SNPs are recognized to respond to selective pressures more rapidly than the slow-mutating more basal SNPs. The hypothesis also explains why raw genetic diversity does not flow temporally from basal to more modern as a concrete rule. The hypothesis contradicts the fixation index, which assumes the neutral theory applies across the entire genome and only considers fast-mutating autosomal DNA in population genetics analyses.

He was also the father of prominent industrialist William Armstrong, 1st Baron Armstrong. Armstrong was born in a small Cumbria village, where he came in contact with the wealthy Losh family. This contact helped him gain a commercial foothold when, in the 1750s, he moved to Newcastle-upon-Tyne, joining a Losh-owned corn firm. Upon the proprietors' bankruptcy, Armstrong collected together the funds to establish his own corn firm: Armstrong, & Co. Financially established, Armstrong was able to pursue his own interests. Armstrong took part local reformist politics, where he and his friends, James Losh and Armorer Donkin, campaigned for parliamentary acts in Newcastle, and Armstrong attempted to reform the administration of the River Tyne, to limited success. He entertained the local high society at the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, warmly supporting its growth. Armstrong also pursued a recreational mathematical interest, contributing to some minor journals, and leaving a large collection of mathematical volumes to the Society. Early life and education James Losh (1763‚Äì1833), friend of Armstrong, member of the powerful Losh family, and fellow reformer of Newcastle. Very little is known of Armstrong's early life. He was born in 1778, in the small village of Wreay, Cumbria, the son of a local shoemaker, and descended from a long line of yeomen. Armstrong attended the local village school, developing an early interest in mathematics, and attending alongside the children of John Losh, from the local Losh family: James (1763‚Äì1833), George (1766‚Äì1846), and William. The Losh family were powerful in this area, descended from the Arloshes, who had occupied the area for over two centuries, and residing in the large local mansion, known as Woodside. Though the family were never honoured with titles, John Losh was known locally as \\"the big black squire\\" of Woodside. At this school, Armstrong was tutored by the local priest, William Gaskin, an eccentric man who James Losh recalled as \\"uncouth in his manners and abrupt and confused in his manner of speaking\\", if also \\"a man of considerable powers of mind\\". Armstrong was also likely introduced to the celebrated mathematics teacher, John Dawson, by John and James Losh, who both later studied under him at Sedbergh School. Career as a corn merchant In the mid-1790s, Armstrong arrived in Newcastle upon Tyne, promptly joining Losh, Lubbren & Co, a Quayside firm of corn merchants, as a clerk in the firm's counting house. George Losh was here, a senior partner in the firm, alongside the naturalised German merchant, John Diedrich Lubbren. The Losh family had grown powerful in Newcastle, with George also owning the local Newcastle Fire Office and Water Company, and his brothers - William and James - later becoming influential members of Tyneside's high society. In Summer 1803, the firm went bankrupt, when the abrupt collapse of the Newcastle banking house, Surtrees and Burdon, left George Losh and his partners financially embarrassed, the first of a series of failures that led Losh to migrate to France. Armstrong - then married and with one daughter - was forced to rely on financial support from his wife's family, Diedrich Lubbren, and possibly William Losh, using the funds to start his own enterprise in the corn industry: \\"Armstrong & Co., merchants, Cowgate\\". Career as a local politician Armorer Donkin (1779‚Äì1851), close friend of Armstrong and fellow reformer of Newcastle. In August 1824, Armstrong and Armorer Donkin, a close friend of Armstrong's, both with a passion for reform in their city, were appointed by the Moot Hall to a committee to recommend the construction of either a horse-drawn railway or canal between Newcastle and Carlisle. Armstrong clearly saw the importance of his duty, noting: \\"We can bring corn from the Cape of Good Hope to Newcastle cheaper than we can convey it between Newcastle and Carlisle\\". Armstrong was cautious of a railway system, as a relatively new form of transport, referring to the plan as \\"spiritless\\". This argument did not meet with agreement on the committee, and the following year, it recommended the construction of the Newcastle & Carlisle Railway, headed by the more radical reformer, James Losh. This preference has variously been suggested as evidence of his innate fear of new technology, or his rational preference as a cautious corn merchant, wanting his stock to be carried in more safe and established modes of transport. In 1831, Armstrong, James Losh, and Donkin attended Northumberland reform meeting in support of the Great Reform Act - a wide-ranging democratic act of parliament, which had met with much opposition - and supporting a resolution against the House of Lords, who had most vigorously opposed the act. After the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, which reformed the governance of local boroughs, Armstrong was elected as a reformist candidate in the Newcastle town council, an office he attained with a substantial majority against the reactionary, Matthew Anderson. At the council, Armstrong voted in favour of the removal of the furniture and fittings of the Mayor's residence, and the end of the tradition of the Mayor's feasts, held at the public expense. His success didn't sustain in the following, 1839 election, where he was defeated by a landslide by the \\"more formidable opponent\\", George Palmer, losing his seat 38 votes to 8. With Palmer's retirement, Armstrong returned to the office in 1842, unopposed. In January 1849, upon the vacancy of a seat, he was unanimously elected an alderman of Newcastle. The aldermen were not so harmonious when, a few months later, he was proposed to be made the mayor of Newcastle, as the queen was expected to visit the town soon. The better known watercolourist, Joseph Crawhall II was selected in his stead to preside over the royal visit. By November the following year, Armstrong was elected mayor; he lead a mayoralty described by local historian Richard Welford as \\"quiet and uneventful\\", in which Armstrong led the \\"usual festivities\\" and \\"presided over the usual number of public meetings\\". Armstrong was generally a progressive, but began as a more independent, and sometimes reactionary, politician, remaining a \\"timid reformer\\" even afterwards, according to Welford. In the 1832 general election he voted for both Tory and Whig Newcastle MP candidates. By the 1835 election, he was decidedly in favour of the Whigs. By 1837, he was divided between two candidates - Charles John Bigge and William Ord - after which he expressly favoured Whig (or, later, Liberal) candidates. One political concern he held, despite his reformist reputation, was against the abolition of the Corn Laws - a set of taxes on imported food, which kept domestic grain prices high - a reform he spoke out vigorously against in 1845, perhaps out of self interest as a corn merchant. While a local politician, Armstrong primarily concerned himself with the management of the River Tyne. Before the 1835 Act, the council had been derided for its neglect of the river, and many hoped the new council would attend to its problems. In his first term as councillor, Armstrong issued a polemical pamphlet of his observations on the river's improvement, and in 1843, promptly took over the local River Committee, upon the previous chairman's death. Despite the many heated debates Armstrong held on it, \\"neither he nor the council's appointed engineer had the skills needed to enable a programme of improvement to be pursued with any degree of confidence\\", according to Stafford M. Linsley, writing for the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Armstrong's incompetence, as well as the widespread belief that the Committee's funds were being inappropriately used, led to agitation against the Committee, especially from those heavily economically invested in the river, as in North and South Shields. Armstrong held this position, continuing his demands for reformation, which invariably met with the formidable opposition of the council, until the Tyne Improvement Act of 1850 was passed. This act dismantled the council's authority over the river, instead putting it under the control of a group of commissioners. The bill was put forth to the House of Commons in June 1850, naming Armstrong as one of the life commissioners, but, after complaints from the council, Armstrong's name was substituted for that of William Rutherford Hunter before the bill was presented to the House of Lords. Personal life and death William George Armstrong, Armstrong's son and later 1st Baron Armstrong, aged 21 Around 1801, Armstrong married Ann Potter, the eldest daughter of William Potter of Walbottle House, and a \\"highly cultured woman\\" according to Henry Palin Gurney, writing for the Dictionary of National Biography. They had two children, a daughter and a son. The daughter, Ann, the eldest of the two, married William Henry Watson, a minor politician and judge. The son, William, later to become first Baron Armstrong, was a prominent industrialist, scientist, and inventor. The Armstrong household allowed William to nurture an early mechanical interest, often visiting the joiner employed by William Potter for lessons in mechanics. The family initially lived in a three-storey terraced house on 9 Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, where his son, William was born, and spent his early childhood, developing a passion for water and fishing. The house no longer exists, but the remaining lintel refers to the establishment as the 'Armstrong House', and a stone adjacent to Christ Church, Shieldfield, commemorates it. By the 1820s, with Armstrong's trade flourishing, the family moved to a larger, 12 acre establishment in Ouseburn Valley, where Armstrong built a house, known as South Jesmond House. His financial success in the corn industry allowed Armstrong to pursue several personal interests, including a passion for mathematics. He contributed to the recreational mathematics journals, The Ladies' Diary and Gentleman's Diary, and collected a large mathematical library. Armstrong joined the recently founded Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society in 1798, \\"a warm supporter of the institution and man of scholarly acquirements\\" according to a contemporary, and helped found the local Natural History Society. He also provided funds for the establishment of a local chamber of commerce, where he served on the committee. At the Literary and Philosophical Society, Armstrong became close friends with the local solicitor, Armorer Donkin. \\"Their tastes were similar; their political views harmonized; their aims were practically identical, and they became as brothers\\" according to local historian, Alfred Cochrane. Donkin remained a family friend and, later in his life, took the younger William as an apprentice. Armstrong died on 2 June 1857, having given up many of his offices weeks earlier. Armstrong requested that his son, William, leave his large library of mathematical and local tracts to the Literary and Philosophical Society, a wish William fulfilled the following year, with 1284 works added to the society's libraries. This allowed the society \\"a more complete mathematical department than any other provincial institution in the kingdom\\" according to Dr. Robert Spence Watson, Secretary of the Society, 1862‚Äì93. Armstrong was buried in the local Jesmond Old Cemetery, in the same grave as his wife, who had predeceased him on 8 June 1848, and next to the grave of Armorer Donkin, who had died in 1851. Armstrong and Donkin's graves are, aside from their inscriptions, identical, with the twin low, cruciform, granite structures likely designed by the younger Armstrong.

It can occur when bacteria found in a free-living state enter a restrictive state (either as endosymbionts or parasites) or are completely absorbed by another organism becoming intracellular (symbiogenesis). The bacteria will adapt to survive and thrive in the restrictive state by altering and reducing its genome to get rid of the newly redundant pathways that are provided by the host. In an endosymbiont or symbiogenesis relationship where both the guest and host benefit, the host can also undergo reductive evolution to eliminate pathways that are more efficiently provided for by the guest.  Examples  Endosymbiont or parasitic microorganisms such as Rickettsia prowazekii, Chlorella in Paramecium, Buchnera aphidicola in aphids, and Wolbachia bacteria in Wuchereria bancrofti have all been studied and fully sequenced which is why they are used as examples of reductive evolution. Sometimes bacteria will eliminate genes from their genome, this is called reductive evolution. Reductive genes can be nonessential to the organism and makes it so the bacteria can reproduce more efficiently. Another example of this would be the black queen hypothesis, where bacteria rely on extracellular metabolites, produced by symbiotic bacteria in their environment. The bacteria become dependent on one another by reducing, getting rid of the genes responsible for producing their own metabolites. It can also be a from obligate intracellular organisms that reduce their genomes and become dependent on the host to produce metabolites for the organism to use.  Endosymbiotic theory  Reductive evolution is the basis behind the Endosymbiotic Theory, which states that Eukaryotes absorbed other microorganisms (Eukaryotes and archaea) for their metabolites produced. The absorbed organisms undergo reductive evolution, deleting genes that were deemed nonessential or non-beneficial to the cell in its specific niche in the host. When comparing fossil evidence reductive evolution can be demonstrated. DNA found in ancient prokaryotic and mitochondria fossils have been found to have higher levels of cytosine and guanine compared to the DNA found in the same organism today. Different segments of the genome found to be unfavorable have possibly been removed over time due to deletions of DNA causing the genome to be reduced. The amount of cytosine and guanine in an organisms genome is a direct correlation to the overall size of that genome. The genome can become more complex or simplified due to random mutations. Chlorella is a secondary endosymbiont that lives within Paramecium species and is an example of obligate intracellular reductive evolution. Moranella is a double membrane gram-negative-like bacteria that lives in another endosymbiont, \\"Candidatus Tremblaya\\", which itself lives in the mealy bug. Genome Sizes of Various Organisms, displaying the reduction of genomes over time to remove inessential genes. History Following reductive evolution, it is suggested that between 180 and 425 million years ago the Rickettsia parasite incident occurred. It has been hypothesized that this event had to have happened later on as the Rickettsia and mitochondria evolved from a common ancestor. With this information, scientists understand that Rickettsia and mitochondria had to have happened at different points in their evolution. Fossils have been used to identify and confirm these endosymbiotic events, but not nearly enough have been found for a good statistical sample size. Lyn Margulis remarked, \\"bacterium established a stable residence within the cytoplasm of a primitive eukaryote and supplied the cell with energy in exchange for a protected environment with a ready supply of nutrients.\\" This became the leading theory of endosymbiosis. This was further proved with the finding that mitochondria and chloroplasts had a separate genome from the host genome, but had lost the ability to live outside of the host.  Identification  There are many methods to help identify if genes have been deleted, two of which are maximum parsimony (MP) or maximum likelihood (ML) patterns are used to recreate the evolutionary tree of these species and their gene compositions of the ancient forms as well as the gene losses and gained along the tree branches which are then compared to each other. There are limitations, however, mostly due to using different models or adding new information which can skew results. Such as using Dollo Parsimony or Weighted Parsimony. Maximum parsimony (MP) Maximum likelihood (ML) Rickettsia prowazekii is an unrestricted microorganism which has been used to demonstrate genome degradation DNA and genome size is not linked to the complexity of an organism. There are some bacteria that have a lot more DNA than a human. This is not yet understood and is referred to as the C-value Enigma or C-value Paradox. In other words, the vast amount of DNA in a haploid genome doesn't compare to the complexity of an organism and can be very different. Through the process of reductive evolution large sections of the DNA could have been removed, turned off, or phased out by the organism if found to be no longer useful in its desire to survive and grow.

Northern Mali conflict Ansar Dine and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) held military control over Timbuktu during April 2012 to January 2013. Ansar Dine and AQMI created what they called a religious police force, a morals brigade and an Islamic tribunal, which severely punished locals disobeying the Ansar Dine/AQMI rules, with imprisonment, unfair trials, flogging, torture and the destruction of religious objects. Al- Hassan allegedly joined Ansar Dine in early 2012 and by May 2012 had become a member of the religious police. Al-Hassan also allegedly cooperated with the Islamic tribunal, knowing, according to the Prosecution at the ICC, that the tribunal operated unfairly, and participated in carrying out the tribunal's punishments and in the destruction of Muslim mausoleums in Timbuctoo. Al- Hassan allegedly participated in a program of forced marriages that effectively rendered Timbuktu women and girls as sexual slaves. ICC case The Prosecutor of the ICC ICC investigation in Mali argues that al-Hassan's actions during 2012 and 2013 constitute part of the systematic policy of an organisation against the civilian population of Timbuktu, and that he individually, together with others, via others, and by giving orders or encouragements, is penally responsible for crimes against humanity and war crimes. =Mandate and arrest= The ICC issued a mandate for al-Hassan's arrest on 27 March 2018. He was surrendered by Mali to the court several days later, arriving in the Netherlands on 31 March 2018. The case against al- Hassan was described as \\"groundbreaking\\" in The Guardian as it included sexual enslavement as a major component of the war crimes and crimes against humanity charges. Melinda Reed of Women's Initiatives for Gender Justice described the case as \\"another step in a positive evolution. Every decision matters. We are writing the jurisprudence of the future now, so every case and every step is extremely important with regards to gender-based and sexual crimes.\\" =Trial= On 30 September 2019, ICC judges confirmed the charges against al- Hassan and stated that the trial would proceed.

It is home to the Ipswich BMX Club. National Cycle Route 51 passes through the park. It is designated a County Wildlife Site. History 1902 Ordnance Survey showing the site of Landseer park The area used to be wooded valley with a brook running down from east to west and into the River Orwell. The 1902 Ordnance Survey map shows an area known as Clapgate, which means a \\"gate on to a waste or common‚Äîwhich the animals going to the common can push open but which shuts automatically so that they cannot get out.\\" There is also a wooded area marked as Alder Carr, a kind of land form also featured on the same map in the nearby Holywells Estate. This name is retained on the Ipswich Wildlife Audit 2013 map. The audit describes how up until the 1960s the site consisted of various mature trees set in woodland, alongside shrubland, and wetland features such as wet meadows, fen, streams and ponds. However, during the 1950s and 1960s, except for the playground area at the eastern end of the park, the site was used as a landfill site to dispose of domestic waste. Thousands of tonnes of household waste and possibly some industrial waste and even a dead horse were dumped there. Nevertheless, the area was used by local children from the Gainsborough Estate as a play area, and the existence of the now buried rubbish is still indicated by the presence of tall cast iron methane vents Geology Red Crag in Landseer Park Part of the area has a 2 metre layer of Red Crag, i.e. fossilised seashells coloured red by iron, sitting on top of London Clay. Ipswich BMX Club The Ipswich BMX Club built the first BMX track in the UK here in 1980.The club continues to provide coaching and races in the park on a regular basis. In 2013 they applied to Ipswich Borough Council for funds to upgrade the track surface so that they could continue to hold practice sessions and meet the necessary standards for national and international BMX meets.

This toolset was developed in association with software engineers Dr. Bill Collis, Simon Robinson, Ben Kent from The Foundry and consists of an integrated suite of software tools that provides temporal coherence for enhancing visual effects in motion picture sequences with high quality robustness, modularity and flexibility. Before this technology, such tasks were very difficult and only possible with manual editing. The Furnace technology enabled some archive films to be restored such as John F Kennedy's visit to Ireland in 1963. In 2018, Peter Jackson used a lot of these video and audio restoration technologies in his documentary film They Shall Not Grow Old which transformed 100-year-old footage of the First World War into rich colour and sharp relief. = Other awards = In 2001, Anil Kokaram was made Fellow of Trinity College Dublin, which rewards a Scholarship or research achievement. In 2007 he received an Honorary Fellowship from Engineers Ireland. In 2012, he was selected as one of America's 50 most influential Irish executives in Hollywood (also known as ITLG Hollywood 50) by the Irish Technology Leadership Group. He received the title of National Icon awarded by The Government of Trinidad and Tobago in 2013.  Green Parrot Pictures, Google and Youtube  = Beginning in the Film Industry = In 1995, Anil Kokaram worked on the post-production of the film The Matrix in the field of DSP for special effects.

With Green Parrot Pictures Pr. Kokaram was the first to create a library of motion-based algorithms for a wide range of post- production tasks including Dirt and Sparkle, Noise and missing frames using motion estimation technology that combined both spatial and temporal information. The enhancement technology consists of picture detail increase, addition of effects not originally present, modification of the movement of a scene and amplification or altering of the colour content. Using statistical signal processing the start-up company provided a tool able to make self diagnostic of the good quality output. It is also able to adapt the quality of a picture depending on performance characteristics of personal, home or broadcast devices. Green Parrot Pictures also developed applications for the early iPhone (such as Color Claw) and plug-ins for Adobe Afx, Premiere and Final Cut. Their first product \\"FilmFix\\" was marketed with Red Giant Software. In 2009 the company also worked with Movidius on their first video processing research. = Collaboration with Google = In 2011, Google bought Green Parrot Pictures in order to improve the look of videos posted on its website by using bandwidth more efficiently. This included Google-owned company YouTube which planned to perform background processing on user videos while being uploaded to the site with sharpness improvement, visual noise and camera shake reduction. The sum paid by Google has not been disclosed. This acquisition disturbed the users from other software editors which were in partnership with Green Parrot before, but were not able to keep using the technologies following Google's acquisition. Red Giant is one of them with their Denoiser product. From 2011 to 2017, Anil Kokaram became Technology Lead in the Transcoding Group as well as the Chrome Media Algorithms Group of Google and YouTube at their office in Mountain View, California.

He spent much of his two-decade long reign consolidating and expanding the territories of his relatively new kingdom. Background Lunkaran was born on 12 January 1470, a younger son of Rao Bika, the eponymous founder of the kingdom of Bikaner. His mother, Bhatiyani Rani Rang Kanwar, was the daughter of Rao Shekha, the Bhati ruler of Pugal. Reign In January 1505, Lunkaran ascended the throne at the age of 35 following the premature death of his elder brother Nara. His first military engagement was the suppression of nobles who, after having lost lands under Bika, had revolted during the reign of Nara. Later, in 1509, he marched against Man Singh Chauhan of Dardrewa, defeating him after a siege of seven months and absorbing his lands. In 1512, he invaded Fatehpur, which was being ruled by the Kayam Khani king Daulat Khan. Taking advantage of a feud between Khan and another ruler, Lunkaran swept into the region and annexed 120 villages. The following year, he defeated the Khanzada ruler of Nagaur in battle and also conquered extensive territory from Chayal Rajputs near Hisar and Sirsa. In early 1526, he became involved in a dispute with Rawal Jait Singh of Jaisalmer. Allegedly, the contention arose when Jait Singh insulted Lunkaran's clan, the Rathores, publicly in court. When chided by a noble visiting from Bikaner, the Rawal mocked them further by stating that he would bestow to the Brahmins of his kingdom as much land as the Rathors could ride over. When the noble reported the exchanged to Lunkaran, he took up the challenge and, with his riders, invaded the Rawal's territory. His forces penetrated as far as the city of Jaisalmer itself and laid siege to it, capturing Jait Singh in the process. He only lifted the assault and released the captive king after the latter pledged to give his daughter in marriage to one of Lunkaran's sons. Death In March that same year, Lunkaran and three of his sons rode into battle against the Nawab of Narnaul. However, while fighting in the village of Dhosi, several of his supporters withdrew from the battle. As a result of this, the Bikaner forces were overwhelmed, with Lunkaran and his sons being killed.

The rainbow roll is considered as the next step of sushi introduction into the United States culinary culture after the California roll, the first roll with nori seaweed leaf hidden inside rice. While the California roll uses no raw fish at all, the rainbow roll takes it one step further by adding raw tuna, salmon, and white fish.

McKillip, a sequel to her earlier novel The Sorceress and the Cygnet. Despite a mixed reception, it was nominated for the 1994 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. It was first published in hardcover by Ace Books in September 1993, with a paperback following from the same publisher in September 1995. The first British edition was published in paperback by Pan Books in July 1994. It was subsequently combined with The Sorceress and the Cygnet into the omnibus collection Cygnet, issued in trade paperback by Ace Books in March 2007. It has also been translated into French. Summary Two strangers disrupt the settled life of the inhabitants of Ro Holding, the Hold of the Cygnet, and particularly cousins, Meguet Vervaine, warrior-maid, and Nyx, sorceress and daughter of the Holder Lauro Ro. Meguet stands guard outside a council meeting when the wily, powerful mage Rad Ilex invades the chamber, seeking an ancient object of power hidden in the castle. Meguet and Nyx are able to resist his spell, and Nyx, ignorant of what the mage is looking for, bars Rad from his search. Afterwards a magical firebird arrives, whose anguished cries and fiery breath transform people and things into jeweled trees. Moonlight restores them to their original forms, and the firebird to his--that of a tormented, partly amnesiac young man named Brand, son and heir of Draken, half-dragon king of the land of Saphier. Unraveling the mystery of Brand's enchantment and breaking the curse on him become prime goals of the protagonists. The thwarted Rad, returning, fights Brand and is wounded. He flees, abducting Meguet. Nyx follows, having found what Rad seeks, a magical key containing the spells of the long-dead wizard Chrysom. To save her cousin, free Brand, and learn the cause of Rad and Draken's enmity, Nyx travels to distant Saphier across the eerie, dragon-haunted desert of Luxour, whose slumbering denizens Draken seems intent on awakening. Reception Cathy Chauvette in School Library Journal notes that, \\"[a]s she did in The Riddlemaster of Hed ... and The Forgotten Beasts of Eld ..., McKillip weaves a magic spell of words almost as intoxicating as a drug. The result will depend on readers; some will find its effect addictive, while others will be confused and long for a breath of fresh air. ... The language, though, is either the glory or the curse of the novel. For those who enjoy smoky misdirection and brilliant word pictures, this book will be a feast. All others, be wary.\\"Chauvette, Cathy. Review in School Library Journal v. 40, iss. 5, May 1994, page 143. Sybil S. Steinberg in Publishers Weekly finds the book an \\"adequate but lackluster follow-up to The Sorceress and the Cygnet, [with an] often tedious plot [that] has too much pursuit and discussion, and not enough direct conflict and dramatic tension.

She specialises in coherence spectroscopies and coherent control in isolated molecules, as well as nanoplasmonics and mathematical models.  Early life and education  Seideman was born in Israel. She studied chemistry at the Tel Aviv University and graduated suma cum laude with a bachelor's degree in 1982. She joined the Weizmann Institute of Science for her doctoral studies and earned her PhD under the supervision of Moshe Shapiro in 1990. Her doctoral work considered the quantum theory of laser catalysis. Seideman was made a Fulbright Program fellow at University of California, Berkeley. Here she worked with William H. Miller on theoretical chemistry. In 1992 she joined the Ames Research Center as a research fellow before being appointed a research associate at the National Research Council of Canada.  Research and career  Seideman was made an associate research officer at the National Research Council of Canada in 1996. She was cross-appointed as a professor of chemistry at Queen's University. Here she developed photoelectron angular distributions (PADs) to study short pulse pump-probe scenarios. Seideman was made a professor of chemistry at Northwestern University in 2003. She was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Foundation fellowship in 2004. Seideman applies quantum mechanical methods and computational chemistry to understand current-induced dynamics in molecular electronic devices. She investigates both electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom, and understands electron transport using scattering spectroscopies. Seideman has explored coherent control, which can be used in semiconductor device technologies, gas-phase molecular dynamics and biology. She also shown that you can guide light using nanoparticle arrays to create custom nanoplasmonics. This has included laser alignment, which can impart long-range orientational order to molecular layers. In dense molecular assemblies, alignment can become a collective phenomenon with long range translational and orientational order. In polyatomic molecules alignment can be used to control torsional motions, which can impact charge transfer in solution and the solid-state. She proposed that this coherent control could be used to drive a molecular machine. Additionally she has demonstrated it is possible to use a scanning tunnelling microscope to control surface reactions. Her recent work has developed theoretical and computational models to control the nanoscale properties of electronic devices. This has included an investigation in charge transport through molecular and nanoscale electronic materials in an effort to improve the efficiency of solar cells. In an effort to understand charge transport mechanisms, she has studied optically induced tunnelling through thesec materials. In 2011 she completed a visiting professor position at the Weizmann Institute of Science. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 1989 Daniel Brener Award * 1989 Knesset of Israel Award * 1996 Wegner Award * 2001 Fellow of the American Physical Society * 2004 John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation * 2011 Sackler Award * 2011 Member of the German Academy of Sciences * 2013 University of Hamburg Mildred Dresselhaus Award * 2015 Weizmann Institute of Science Weston Professorship * 2017 Journal of Physical Chemistry Celebration of Women Chemists = Selected publication = Her publications include;   References  Category:Israeli women chemists Category:1959 births Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:Weizmann Institute of Science alumni Category:Tel Aviv University alumni Category:Northwestern University faculty Category:Queen's University at Kingston faculty Category:Living people ","title":"Tamar Seideman"},{"id":"61927174","text":"350px Madonna and Child with St Anthony of Padua and St Roch is a c.1511 oil on canvas painting by Titian, originally given to Philip IV of Spain by his viceroy of Naples Ramiro N√∫√±ez de Guzm√°n and now in the Prado Museum in Madrid.

Like many other progressive couples of the time they combined their surname to Sadd Brown. They moved to London where they had four children including: Myra Sadd Brown (1899‚Äì1992); Emily Price Brown (1906‚Äì1988) and Jean Frances Brown (1908‚Äì1988).

A lover of the arts, she enjoyed the plays of George Bernard Shaw and numbered artists among her friends, including Henry Holiday and Jessie Mothersole. The Women's Suffrage Movement Drawing of Myra Sadd Brown at a Suffragette meeting by Jessie Mothersole (1912) Following her marriage in 1896 Myra Sadd Brown maintained her interest in the women's suffrage movement. She became a subscriber to the Central Society for Women's Suffrage in 1902 and joined the Women's Social and Political Union in 1907, also maintaining her membership of other such suffrage groups as the Women's Freedom League and the Free Church League for Woman Suffrage. Her letters publicising the cause regularly appeared in such publications as the Christian Commonwealth and she also involved her children in the fight including persuading her teenage daughter Myra to stand in the street selling copies of The Woman's Dreadnought. Later she would be involved in Sylvia Pankhurst's East London Federation of Suffragettes in which cause she would invite bus-loads of women from London's East End to her house near Maldon in Essex.

Later life and legacy The Hunger Strike Medal awarded to Myra Sadd Brown in 1912 During World War I the Women's Social and Political Union and other groups dedicated to the campaign for women's suffrage suspended their militant actions to focus on the war effort. During this time women worked in jobs traditionally done by men, proving they could do them just as well and silencing one of the last arguments against women's suffrage. After the war the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed awarding the vote to women householders, or the wives of householders, aged 30 and over. On the cessation of hostilities Myra Sadd Brown became an active member of the International Suffrage Alliance and was at the forefront of setting up of the British Commonwealth League (later the Commonwealth Countries League) in 1925, a feminist group dedicated to upholding the rights of women in Commonwealth countries. She became the League's Treasurer. Her husband Ernest Sadd Brown, who had supported her throughout her years of campaigning and activism, died of rheumatic heart disease in 1930. In 1937 Myra Sadd Brown travelled to south-east Asia in order to be present at the birth of her second grandchild. She then travelled to Angkor Wat and Malaya before moving on to Hong Kong, planning to return home on the Trans-Siberian Railway.

Biography Bagnall was born in Turua in 1882,Bagnall Island Register and moved to Tonga whilst working as a purser on the Ysabel schooner.Mr. W. G. Bagnall Pacific Islands Monthly, August 1957, 149 He initially worked for the Vines Utting and Purston trading firm, before joining the Postal Department. He also owned a plantation on Tongatapu.Personal items Pacific Islands Monthly, April 1931, p9 He married Lilly Riechelmann from Nuku ªalofa. The couple had an adopted son. Bagnall rose within the civil service to become Treasurer, before being appointed Minister of Finance in January 1919, also becoming a member of the Legislative Assembly.Phyllis Herda, Jennifer Terrell & Niel Gunson (1996) Tongan Culture and History The Journal of Pacific History, pp174‚Äì184 The presence of four Europeans in key positions (Herbert Cecil Stronge as Chief Justice, James Darrell Wall as Auditor-General and Alexander Brooke Wallace as Minister for Public Works) led to a rebellion by opposition MPs, who held a majority in the Assembly. However, despite going on strike in 1920, their demand that Bagnall be removed from office was refused by Queen SƒÅlote. During his time as Minister of Finance, Bagnall became the second-highest ranking person in European social circles after the British consul, and his wife occasionally acted as SƒÅlote's social secretary. However, when a new Chief Justice William Hemming Stuart arrived in 1938, Bagnall fell foul of his new ministerial colleague. After refusing to pay for Stuart's excess fares and baggage fees upon his arrival, Bagnall's presence in the house previously reserved for chief justices, and his speeches to the Privy Council in Tongan (which Stuart could not understand) led to a feud between the two. Stuart claimed that Tonga was ruled by a camarilla, which included Bagnall. As a result of Stuart's repeated attacks on Bagnall, meetings of the cabinet and Privy Council had to be suspended by SƒÅlote. When a treasury clerk named Uliti was convicted of embezzlement in May 1939, Stuart used his judgement to attack Bagnall and Prime Minister Viliami Tungƒ´ Mailefihi, claiming that Bagnall had committed perjury and had been involved in the theft. The judgement stated that Bagnall had been having an affair with a cousin of Uliti, who had acted as a go-between. As a result, when Bagnall investigated Uliti over the missing funds, Uliti had held influence over him.Sensational judgement in Tongan embezzlement case Pacific Islands Monthly, August 1939, pp24‚Äì25 On the same day that the judgement was released, SƒÅlote asked the British High Commissioner Harry Luke to recall Stuart. However, a 1,100-signature petition was subsequently brought to SƒÅlote requesting all ministers except Stuart and Sioape Kaho were sacked, and the British Colonial Office opined that Stuart's removal would give weight to the reports of malpractice. As a result, SƒÅlote asked Bagnall for his resignation, which he gave on 21 July.Tongan Minister Resigns: Development in Impeachment Crisis Pacific Islands Monthly, September 1939, p50 Two days earlier a bill had been presented in the Legislative Assembly to impeach him. After retiring Bagnall moved to Auckland. He died in hospital at the age of 74 in 1957.

History  Ottmar H√∂rl designed the Euro-Skulptur towards the end of the 1990s, creating two copies. While one of these was set up at Frankfurt Airport, he gave away the other version to the private corporation Frankfurter Kultur Komitee which decided to put it on display at Willy-Brandt-Platz in front of the then seat of the European Central Bank, or ECB which was then at the Eurotower. The sculpture replaced the Euro clock that had been installed there before. Its lights were switched on for the first time at New Year 2001/2002 when the Euro was introduced. The Euro-Skulptur is among the objects most often photographed in Frankfurt's inner city. It is frequently used to illustrate reports on the Euro. When the ECB moved from its office at Willy- Brandt-Platz to its new building in Frankfurt's east end in 2014, discussions took place whether to also relocate the sculpture to the new site, or move it to a museum. The Frankfurter Kultur Komitee was also asked to perhaps move the sculpture to a central location in Paris. So far, it remained at its first location.

The sub sector basically covers Yaldor, a small village in the Indus river basin in the Leh district of Ladakh in India, and Yaldor nullah. The village located in the upper reaches of the mountains near the Line of Control that divides the Indian- and Pakistan-administered Kashmir, the village abuts the Yaldor nullah. The area was a focal point during the Kargil War because of its strategic location between Kargil, Leh and Baltistan. Only a few shepherd families live in Yaldor village, they spend their summers here and then spend their winters in Garkhun, taking their livestock with them. One of the shepherds from Garkhun, Tashi Namgyal, who was looking for his missing yak was the first to report about infiltrators from Pakistan on 3 May 1999 to Indian Army. The village has an army patrol base, which was set up in 1997 even before the Kargil infiltration of 1999. As of 2019, the village is out of bounds for tourists. Terrain and weather The Yaldor nullah is integral part of the area's terrain. It is made up of 2 streams Yaldor West or Gragrio and Yaldor East or Junk Lungpa and they merge at the namesake village before joining Indus river at Dah. Due to mountainous terrain the roads in the area near village are serpentine. Known for its difficult terrain, during the Kargil war, Yaldor was used as the focal point to launch attack on the 4,821-m Kukerthang and the 5,103-m Tharu despite many nullahs and non-tactical terrain. The terrain is so difficult that Indian Army and Pakistan Army, under mutual understanding left their posts in this area of LoC unattended during harsh winter. Located in the eastern part of the Batalik‚ÄìChorbat La sector with one of the most rugged terrain after Siachen Glacier, average mountain heights here range from . Temperatures in winter season range from minus 10-15 degrees Celsius during the day to minus 35-40 degree at night. Even during the summer, the night temperatures generally hover around minus 5-10 degrees. Wildlife 125px Though known for its bitter cold weather, a lot of birds and mammal sighting can be done in and around Yaldor area. These include Pallas Dippers, Blue whistling thrush, Brown Dipper and Greenish Leaf Warblers. Also can be seen are Common Swift, Eurasian Crag Martin, Large-billed Crow, and Mountain Chiffchaff. Among other bird species that can be found in the area include Grey Wagtail, Hume's leaf warbler, Red-mantled Rosefinch and Red-fronted Serin. Occasionally Himalayan Ibex can also be seen in the area. Kargil war 1999 Yaldor Sub Sector was the scene of some of the major infiltration by Pakistani Northern Light Infantry battalions and some of the major battles of Kargil War were fought here including battle to retake Jubar, Point 4812, Point 5203, Munthodalo, and Khalubar. During the war a helipad was built in the area for safe transport of troops and material. Between 3‚Äì5 May 1999 two Indian army patrols in Yaldor area encountered a group of armed men, from Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Indian Army's first contact with infiltrators from Pakistan was in Banju area, who aimed to seize mountain peaks inside India to escalate Kashmir conflict, this encounter culminated in Kargil War. The scene of some of the major battles of Kargil War, in May 1999 the 12 JKLI went through the Junk Lungpa (Lungpa means stream in ladakhi) at night to drive a wedge between enemy's defenses on Point 5203 and Khalubar Ridge, and captured Point 5390. During Operation Vijay the 70 Infantry Brigade was responsible for recovery of maximum quantity of arms and ammunition and killing over 300 enemy personnel in this sector. It also captured 6 PoWs alive providing much needed proof of Pakistani involvement. The Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) which played a key role in providing porters for Indian Army during the conflict also sent LBA youth volunteers to Yaldor on June 23, 1999 to act as porter. 300px Brigadier Devinder Singh, the Commander of an Infantry Brigade, who was given the responsibility for conducting operations in Batalik-Yaldor Sector during Operation Vijay, was conferred VSM for his actions. Captain Amol Kalia VrC (posthumous) of 12 Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, was martyred on June 8, 1999, along with 13 other soldiers while trying to recapture Point 5203, a high feature in the Kargil-Yaldor Sector. Captain BM Cariappa of 5 PARA, that took part in the battle to recapture Point 5203 was awarded Vir Chakra for his gallantry in several battles in sector. By July 8, 1999 almost the entire Yaldor sector was liberated. The Ladakh Scouts who were one of the first units to be deployed in the region for Operation Vijay were awarded Unit citation for bravery shown by them during the battles in the Batalik-Yaldor-Chorbatla Sector especially for capture of Point 5203. Major M. Sarvanan of 1 Bihar battalion lost his life on May 29, 1999 while trying to capture Point 4268, he was awarded VrC (posthumous) for his actions, his body was recovered by Indian troops only on July 7, 1999. Major Sonam Wangchuk of Ladakh Scouts was awarded the Mahavir Chakra for actions in same area on June 2, 1999. Post Kargil war 1999 H. S. Panag after taking over as Brigade Commander in January 2000 oversaw a military operation in the Yaldor Sub Sector that destroyed 35 Pakistani bunkers and killed several Pakistani soldiers across the LoC there by giving India complete control over Batalik Sector. Another operation in May 2000 allowed Indian Army led by 3 Punjab and 1 Bihar to take control of of Karubar Bowl on the Pakistani side. This also gave Indian Army an option to threaten the Pakistani posts opposite Turtuk sector. He also ensured that Pakistan could not set up a post on Dolmi Barak, a high peak on the eastern side of Karubar Bowl.

She was born in Calcutta, India and earned her bachelor‚Äôs degree at Lady Shri Ram College for women, Delhi University. She furthered her education by moving to the United States for her master‚Äôs degree in psychology, from the College of William and Mary, and later received her PhD in social psychology from Harvard. While completing her research at Harvard, she met her husband Raj Marphatia, who was studying at Harvard Law school. After completing her PhD in 1991, she quickly entered the ranks of academia by accepting a position as an assistant professor at the college of the Holy Cross; she become an associate professor at the Tufts University. Ambady later joined the Stanford faculty in 2011, becoming the first individual of Indian origin to teach Stanford‚Äôs department of Psychology. Most notably in her academic career she introduced and conducted extensive research around the concept of thin slice judgments. While teaching at Stanford she founded the SPARQ center and worked to build it until her death in 2013 from leukemia. Her death sparked campaigns to increase the number of South-Asian bone marrow registries globally. Early life and education A native of the state of Kerala, India, Ambady did her schooling at the Lawrence School, Lovedale, and joined college at the Lady Shri Ram College for Women, Delhi. Subsequently, she moved to the United States for higher education, completing her M.A. in Psychology from the College of William & Mary, Virginia. She earned her Ph.D. in social psychology from Harvard University in 1991 under the guidance of Robert Rosenthal, with whom she researched thin slice judgments. Academic career She held academic positions at Harvard University, Cambridge and the College of the Holy Cross, Massachusetts before being appointed as Professor in the Department of Psychology at Tufts University in 2004. She subsequently moved to Stanford University, California in 2011. She was the first Indian-American woman to teach psychology at Harvard, Tufts, and Stanford. Ambady specialized in the study of intuition. Her research found that humans perceive nonverbal cues in response to novel people or situations and that the information gleaned from an instant impression is often as powerful as information gleaned by getting to know a situation or person over a longer period of time. She and Robert Rosenthal coined the term \\"thin slices\\" to refer to such instantaneous non-verbal cues. Later, author Malcolm Gladwell referred extensively to Ambady's work in his popular book, Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. One of Ambady's more well-known experiments asked students to watch silent 10-second videos of unfamiliar professors as they taught, and to rate the professors for likability, honesty, competence, and other qualities. The students' responses correlated remarkably well with similar ratings by students who had spent a full semester getting to know the professors' personalities and teaching qualities. = Founding of SPARQ = During Ambady's appointment at Stanford, she founded SPARQ, the Center for Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions. The center was initially called \\"The Lewin Center\\", after social psychology pioneer Kurt Lewin. SPARQ officially opened its doors in 2014 after the passing of Ambady, however, she remained active in its formation even during her struggle with leukemia, and until her death. The main goal of SPARQ is to improve society by taking knowledge from the field of social psychology directly to policymakers, teachers and other impactful societal figures. SPARQ is an attempt to address the gap between psychology and the real world and aims to build a bridge between the hands-on experiences of practitioners in the field, and the scientific findings of the lab. SPARQ attempts to accomplish this goal through the fostering of meaningful collaborations between practitioners and social psychologies to the benefit of both. Illness and death Ambady was diagnosed with leukemia in May 2004 but recovered after treatment. In 2011, the cancer recurred in a more aggressive form. Her friends and family led an intensive worldwide campaign to find a compatible bone-marrow donor since they were unable to successfully locate any in existing bone-marrow registries. This was partly due to the low numbers of Indians on such registries worldwide and a limited base of donors numbering around 25,000 in the few Indian registries that exist. Her plight sparked a global effort to increase participation in bone marrow registries among South Asian ethnic groups. Though as many as thirteen potential donors were located over a period of time, many of them refused to go through with the transplant process after identification. Ambady died on October 28, 2013 at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  Research  = Culture and neural activation = Nalini Ambady and Jamshed Bharucha produced a study published in the journal Current Directions in Psychological Science in 2009 that focused on articles regarding how culture can affect neural activation. They suggest a framework for cultural neuroscience in which both features are objective: culture mapping and source analysis. Moreover, Ambady discusses source analysis as the process of defining the source or causes of culture mappings. She explains three sources of cultural universals and differences: * Genetic commonality or difference. Behavioural genetics studies examining the functional role of 5-HTT have recognized individuals carrying the short allele seem prone to higher levels of anxiety and depression compared to long allele carriers. In addition, individuals with the short allele showed greater amygdala activation, during an emotion-matching task relative to individuals with the long allele. * Cultural learning and exposure meditated by brain plasticity. The evidence shows how cultural learning originates from inspecting neural processing in bilinguals and learners of a second language. A study included in the article compared Korean adults who were adopted by French families before the age of 8. The results demonstrate how Korean-born subjects did not remember their native languages and were fluent in French. However, both groups demonstrated parallel patterns of activation to sentences spoken in French, Korean or other foreign languages, implying that proficiency in the language of the new culture was connected with neural changes. * Similarity or difference explains the difference in stimuli and pattern structures across cultures. In a meta-analysis comparison, the neuroimaging results for word reading across different languages and cultures found one common area of dispensation across language and cultures. They proposed the existence of a visual word form area in the left mid fusiform gyrus, which seems to be central to word recognition. They also found culture and language- specific patterns of activation. This was through the example of the Chinese writing system which, for example, requires more activation in the visual areas in both hemispheres than do western alphabets. = Racial bias and stereotyping = Race salience and essentialist thinking in racial stereotype development Nalini Ambady conducted a vast number of research to understand how and why individuals develop racial biases and why they stereotype others. Published in the journal Child Development in 2010, Nalini Ambady, Kristin Pauker, and Evan P. Apfelbaum, collaborated on a research study that investigated the arrival and the background of racial stereotyping by studying 89 children between the ages of 3 and 10. For the study, the children had to complete a variety of tasks related to matching and sorting. These tasks were used as a measure to assess the children‚Äôs knowledge and how they apply positive and negative stereotypes when encountered with in-groups and out-groups. The results from those tasks implied that children start to use stereotypes on out-groups when they are around 6 years old. This could occur based on a number of factors, but this study showed that there were 2 predictors that played an important contribution to the use of these stereotypes. The first predictor was race salience, which is where one sees and then organizes those people by race. The second predictor is essentialist thinking, which is where one believes that a certain race cannot change. These two predictors showed when and how these racial stereotypes may be taking place in real-life situations. Stereotype susceptibility in children: Effects of identity activation on quantitative performance Nalini Ambady, Margaret Shih, Amy Kim, and Todd L. Pittinsky worked together on a research study that examined the impact of positive and negative stereotypes had on cognitive performance and shared their findings in the journal Psychological Science in 2001. They accomplished this using two studies which consisted of three separate age groups of children. The first group was between the grade of kindergarten to grade 2 (lower elementary grades). The second group was between the grade of grade 3 and grade 5 (upper elementary grades). The third group was between the grades of grade 6 and grade 8 (middle school). The study showed results of children in lower elementary grades and middle school grades having shifts in their performance based on the positive and negative stereotypes. These findings were also consistent with the adult findings. The stereotypes were subtle and resulted in negative stereotypes impeding one‚Äôs performance and positive stereotypes facilitating one‚Äôs performance. Stereotype susceptibility development is a critical area and is a necessity to be able to understand the connections between an individual‚Äôs behavior and stereotypes. In a different study conducted by Ambady and her colleagues, she looked at the effects of stereotype saliency on the performance of minorities, specifically in this case Asian Women. Because of the different stereotypes associated with the identities of Asian women; Ambady hypothesized that by making one identity salient, in this case, either gender or race, it would impact the women's performance because it would make different stereotypes salient. What Ambady found was, the women who had their gender made salient, performed poorly on mathematical tasks when compared to control. This was in- line with the stereotype that women are less proficient in math. When the women had their Asian identities made salient, their performance improved relative to control, reflecting the stereotype of Asians being \\"good at math\\". These findings were significant as they showed a causal link between stereotype saliency and one's performance, which has real-world impacts. = Nonverbal behavior = Nonverbal communication and psychology: Past and future Ambady and Marvin A. Hecht investigated the relationship between the study of nonverbal communication and psychology in their 1999 article published in the New Jersey Journal of Communication. The study of nonverbal communication was invented in the 1950s primarily as a cross-disciplinary effort on the part of the psychiatrists, linguists and anthropologists. This was surveyed in the 1960s and 1970s by an explosion of empirical research, books, and popular media attention. However, in the 1908s psychologists began to frequently integrate nonverbal communication variables into new research. Attention to nonverbal cues waned as the cognitive revolution gained momentum. In this generation, there is a renaissance of awareness in nonverbal communication, particularly among those who study emotion, psychophysiology and person perception. Consequently, the future of nonverbal communication may lie where it started; as an interdisciplinary venture.  \\"Unspoken cultural influence: Exposure to and influence of nonverbal bias\\"  In a research study published in 2009, Nalini Ambady and Max Weisbuch explored the importance of nonverbal behavior in shaping culture. They used television as a communication medium to investigate the impacts of nonverbal bias on individuals. They discovered that nonverbal bias influenced individuals‚Äô beliefs, attitudes, and behavior. In research constituting 4 studies, they found out that there was a favorable nonverbal attitude towards especially slim female characters in popular TV programs, and exposure to nonverbal bias against heavier women in TV programs influenced the participants‚Äô attitudes about ideal weight. In the last study, they found out that the regional difference in exposure to nonverbal bias accounted for regional variance in unhealthy dieting behavior among female teenagers. \\"Misery loves company: When sadness increases the desire for social connectedness\\" In an attempt to specify the potential functions of sadness, Heather M. Gray, Keiko Ishii, and Nalini Ambady examined the effects of induced sadness on attention and motivation. Functional theories hold that different emotions elicit different adaptive responses in the mind and body to prepare us for specific events or surrounding environment. Within this study, Nalini Ambady and colleagues draw upon the previous research by Pickett and colleagues based on the existence of social monitoring systems (SMS). Nalini and colleagues conducted three experiments to investigate the effects of sadness on attention motivation: In the 1st experiment, they built upon the previous research showing that individuals concerned with social connectedness, were specifically attuned to the vocal tone of speech as an important nonverbal social cue. Nalini and colleagues discovered that sadness associated with social loss resulted in attentional bias towards vocal tone. In their second study, they found a significant effect of induced sadness on increased and urgent motivations for affiliation with others. In the third and last part of their study, they provided evidence to distinguish the effects of social loss sadness versus status loss sadness. In contrary to hedonic contingency hypothesis, their result showed that sad individuals were selective in their choice of behavior; the results established in the 1st and 2nd parts of the study concerning attentional bias toward vocal tone and increased desire for social affiliation were restricted to sadness precipitated by social loss, whereas sadness as a result of status loss did not have the same effects.  \\"Thin slices\\" of behavior  In collaboration with Kathleen R. Bogart and Michael L. Slepian, Nalini advanced the study of ‚Äúthin slices‚Äù of behavior when researching the ability to precisely recognize characteristic traits people possess along with their individuality. This method establishes a way to predict an individual‚Äôs behavior with something as simple as a swift observation of their nonverbal behavior. With a glimpse of someone‚Äôs ‚Äúthin slices‚Äù of behavior, Nalini and her colleagues believed that just by observing nonverbal behavior, one can determine with accuracy to a certain extent, behavioral outcomes influenced by personality disorders (e.g. anxiety, depression etc.); mental states (e.g. suicide); and how an individual adapts to life events. One could even go as far as specific types of life events such as traumatic experience (e.g. divorce, sexual abuse etc.). There is only one limitation to this method, a clinician‚Äôs analysis can falter when presented with a patient suffering from particular clinical disabilities (e.g. movement disorders such as Parkinson‚Äôs disease), since healthy nonverbal behavior is impaired or masked by the exhibited symptoms of these disorders. Conventional methods already entail clinicians to observe their patients and make diagnoses through intuition based on the patient‚Äôs personality traits and nonverbal behavior. With the added method of ‚Äúthin-slice‚Äù judgment, specialists would have another valuable resource to provide more qualitative assessments of their patients. Accuracy of prediction Previously, through a meta-analysis published in 1992, Nalini and co-author Rober Rosenthal coined the term ‚Äúthin slices‚Äù of expressive behavior as a valid method of predicting human behavior. The results of their findings presents that thin slices provide a 70% accuracy prediction as opposed to the 30% when using other assessment methods. They provided three explanations as to why this method is so accurate: * Derivative of ecological approach and social perception. Emotions such as anger, fear or dominance are easily recognized due to how well they are recognized universally and the important role they play in survival and adaptability. In contrast, non-crucial survival emotions such as humor, are more challenging to detect due to the necessity to identify through inferential processes. * Truths to stereotypes and their effects on self-fulfilling prophecies. It is believed that individuals react to stereotype cues, whether they are biological or behavioral. These stereotypes create expectations in others that influence an individual‚Äôs behavior toward the target person and/or group. Research has demonstrated how such expectations will affect people‚Äôs positive or negative behavior toward targeted individuals. By exhibiting these behaviors toward target individuals, they, in turn, modify their behavior and confirm the previous expectations. This creates an endless loop of self- fulfilling prophecies. * Evidence based on the disruptive effect of thinking and reasoning. A reason why evidence drawn from ‚Äúthin slices‚Äù is accurate is due to the fact that the individuals were not exposed to distracting stimuli. Research found that subjects were less accurate in judgement toward other target individuals during face-to-face scenarios in contrast to impressions evaluated from videotaped targeted individuals. This draws upon two types of stimuli, external and internal. External stimuli refer to verbal components that can be distracting within actual interactions and require cognitive resources to process internally. These internal processes can also be distracting because it requires the function of thinking and reasoning which can overpower and cloud judgment. Thin slices of behavior are \\"snap\\" judgments, therefore, bypass all the distracting stimuli, creating a more accurate impression of the targeted individual(s). Awards and honours Ambady was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Psychological Association, and the Association for Psychological Science. She won the AAAS Prize for Behavioral Science Research in 1993. She was presented the Carol and Ed Diener Award in Social Psychology in 1999 by the Society for Personality and Social Psychology for substantial contribution to the field.

As a two- year-old in 2019 she was the best filly of her age in Europe, winning three races including the Curragh Stakes and the Cheveley Park Stakes as well as finishing second in the Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes and ending the season with a rating of 115. Background Millisle is a chestnut filly with a white blaze and two white socks bred and owned by the Newtownards-based Stonethorn Stud Farms. The filly was sent into training with Jessica Harrington at Moone, County Kildare. The filly is named after Millisle, a village in County Down. She was sired by Starpangledbanner who was a champion sprinter in Australia before relocating to Europe where he won the Golden Jubilee Stakes and July Cup in 2010 and took the Cartier Champion Sprinter award. As a breeding stallion he had serious fertility problems, but sired a few other good horses including The Wow Signal, Home of the Brave (John of Gaunt Stakes) and Anthem Alexander (Queen Mary Stakes). Millisle's dam Green Castle showed little racing ability, failing to win in two starts as a four-year-old in 2003. Her dam Green Lucia, who finished second in the Yorkshire Oaks, was a half-sister to Old Vic and closely related to High Top. Racing career =2019: two- year-old season= On her racecourse debut Millisle started the 5/2 second favourite for a five furlong maiden race at Bellewstown on 4 July. Ridden by the apprentice jockey Tom Madden she raced in second place before going to the front and drew away in the final furlong to win \\"comfortably\\" by four and three quarter lengths. The filly was ridden in her races for the rest of the year by Shane Foley. On 26 July she started odds-on favourite for a minor event at Down Royal but after briefly taking the lead in the last quarter mile she was overtaken and beaten into second place by Think Big. At the Curragh Racecourse on 16 August Millisle was stepped up to Listed class and went of the 11/2 fourth choice in a six-runner field for the Curragh Stakes. Racing on soft ground she tracked the leaders for most of the way before staying on strongly in the closing stages to win by half a length from Isabeau. For her next race Millisle was sent to England and moved up in class and distance to contest the Group 3 Dick Poole Fillies' Stakes over six furlongs at Salisbury Racecourse on 5 September. She led for most of the way but despite running \\"very gamely\\" she was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a short head by Dark Lady. Thirty-five minutes before the start of the race a British Horseracing Authority vet had taken a blood sample from the filly and Harrington felt that this may have affected her performance. She commented \\"I do not want this to come across as sour grapes but she was beaten a short-head and small margins make the difference\\". Thirteen days after her defeat at Salisbury, Millisle made a second trip to England and started a 16/1 outsider for the Group 1 Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Raffle Prize, who had won the Queen Mary Stakes and the Duchess of Cambridge Stakes before finishing second to Earthlight in the Prix Morny started odds-on favourite, while the other nine runners included Dark Lady, Tropbeau (Prix du Calvados), Etoile (Fillies' Sprint Stakes) and Living In The Past (Lowther Stakes). Millisle started quickly but then dropped back in the field as Tango set the pace before giving way to Raffle Prize at half way. Millisle began to make progress approaching the final furlong, and sustained her run to overtake Raffle Prize in the closing stages and win by one and three quarter lengths. Foley, who was winning his first Group 1 race in England commented \\"She's an amazing little filly. I've loved her from day one. She was outpaced throughout but I knew when she hit the rising ground she'd stay home, and she enjoyed that nice ground.\\" =2020: three-year-old season= The flat racing season in Britain and Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and the 1000 Guineas was run a month later than usual on 7 June over the Rowley mile at Newmarket. Millisle started the 4/1 joint second favourite but after being in contention in the early stages she dropped away and came home seventh of the fifteen runners, ten lengths behind the winner Love. At Royal Ascot in June she was brought back to sprint distances for the Commonwealth Cup over six furlongs and finished fifth behind Golden Horde. At Naas Racecourse on 4 July she was dropped to Group 3 class and ran second to the British-trained colt Art Power in the Lacken Stakes over six furlongs.

The best known Batwomen are Kate Kane and Kathy Kane. History * The first Batwoman, Kathy Kane, debuted during the Silver Age of Comics within the \\"pre-crisis\\" mainstream DC Universe. * The 1996 limited series Kingdom Come by Mark Waid and Alex Ross presents a Batwoman portrayed as a Batman admirer from Jack Kirby's Fourth World. Her costume mixed Kirby-esque elements with those of the original costume. The character rode a giant bat-winged dog named Ace. * Batman: Dark Knight Dynasty (1997) features Vice-President Brenna Wayne who becomes Batwoman in order to stop Vandal Savage. Wayne discovers a conspiracy against her family after investigating the last thirteen generations of the Wayne family. * JLA: The Nail (1998) by Alan Davis features Selina Kyle adopting a Batwoman costume based on the costume worn by Kathy Kane. The 2004 sequel, JLA: Another Nail, features her fashioning her own Batwoman persona. * Superman/Batman #24 (November 2005) presents a world where the genders of the characters are reversed with Helena Wayne as Batwoman. DC later placed this alternate reality as \\"Earth 11\\" in the post-Infinite Crisis multiverse. Flamebird assumes the mantle of Batwoman in \\"Titans Tomorrow\\". Art by Mike McKone. * Kate Kane as Batwoman debuted in 2005 in the series 52. * In the Teen Titans storyline \\"Titans Tomorrow\\" (2005), Bette Kane is Batwoman, and wears a costume similar to Kathy's pre-Crisis one. In the follow up storyline, \\"Titans of Tomorrow... Today!\\" (2007), Bette Kane remains Flamebird and former Batgirl Cassandra Cain becomes Batwoman. * In DC Comics Bombshells, which take place in an alternate history version of World War II, there are three versions of the character outside of Kate Kane: ** Katherine Webb, a member of the Kane family and the aunt to both Kate and Bette, is the Headmistress of Pinkney Orphanage. She was left in charge of the orphanage by Kate before she left Gotham. Headmistress Webb is a xenophobic woman, who uses the orphans to make robots in order to protect the country from foreigners, whom she characterizes as evil. She is later defeated by a team of Batgirls, including Bette, who come to the orphanage to save the orphans.DC Comics Bombshells #20 ** Kathleen \\"Kathy\\" Duquesne, an auto mechanic and the leader of a team of Batgirls, who protect the city during Batwoman's absence. Along with Kathy, the team includes Nell Little, Harper Row and later on Alysia Yeoh and Bette Kane.DC Comics Bombshells #8DC Comics Bombshells #19 Upon meeting Bette, Kathy immediately recognizes her as a baseball player and later figures out her real identity as well as her connection to Batwoman but promises to keep it a secret. The Batgirls save the orphans of Pinkney Orphanage from the devious Headmistress and later expand their team, welcoming Tim Drake, Cullen Row and Felicity Smoak, and creating a Bat family.DC Comics Bombshells #21 ** Sonia Alcana appears as an officer of Gotham City Police Department, partnered with Crispus Allen and working with Maggie Sawyer to aid Batwoman into her fight against crime in the city. * In 2019 Young Justice, Stephanie Brown is the Batwoman of Earth-3. In other media * The Batwoman alias is occasionally seen in The Batman animated series. In the two-parter \\"Batgirl Begins\\", Barbara Gordon wanted to be known as Batwoman before settling with the Batgirl name. In the episode \\"Artifact\\", Martha Wayne is mistakenly identified as Batwoman in the future along with Thomas Wayne as Batman and their son as Red Robin. * A loose adaptation of Batwoman appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Vanessa Marshall. Though visually based on the Kathy Kane version, the character is instead called The Bat Lady and is also an original character: Katrina Moldoff, the heiress to the Moldoff Circus fortune. Batman: Brave and the Bold director Ben Jones confirmed that the decision to rename the character was brought about after DC Comics voiced concerns about this depiction of the character having a negative impact on the new Batwoman comic book series, the first issue of which launched less than a month after the episode's initial air date. Seen in the episode \\"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\\", she is portrayed as a thrill-seeker and a trained circus acrobat whom Batman dislikes due to her crime-fighting occasionally endangering innocent bystanders. When she is unmasked in public by the Riddler, she is forced to give up her crime-fighting life. She attempts to get revenge by encouraging Felix Faust to use a spell to switch her and Batman's bodies, allowing her to get closer to the Riddler without the police coming after her. When she fails, Batman rescues her and gets Faust to switch them back. She goes along quietly with the police while they are arresting the Riddler and henchmen. * A version of Batwoman appears in Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman, voiced by Kyra Sedgwick. In this storyline (which conforms to the continuity of the DC animated universe), Batwoman is a new vigilante operating in Gotham City who is willing to use lethal force to achieve her goals. She targets the illegal operations of the Penguin and crime bosses Rupert Thorne and Carlton Duquesne. Viewed as a threat, Batman investigates Batwoman in an attempt to uncover her identity and bring her (as well as her targets) to justice. In the investigation, Batman suspects three different women to be Batwoman: Gotham Police Detective Sonia Alcana (voiced by Elisa Gabrielli), Dr. Roxanne \\"Rocky\\" Ballantine (voiced by Kelly Ripa), and Kathleen \\"Kathy\\" Duquesne (voiced by Kimberly Brooks, and a thinly-veiled reference to Kathy Webb-Kane) who Bruce Wayne forms a romantic relationship with. It is eventually revealed that all three women have been posing as Batwoman with grudges against the crime bosses, each acting at a different point to draw suspicion from all three of them. In the DVD and Blu-ray special features, the producers explain that DC did not want the filmmakers to use Kate Kane in a family-friendly movie due to the violence associated with her character.

Adkins (October 25, 1932 - July 16, 2015) was a professor emeritus of psychology and education at Teachers College, Columbia University. Early life and education Adkins was born in Beirut, Syria (now Lebanon) to Turkish and Syrian missionaries Leslie John Adkins and Edith Sanderson. Adkins was a graduate of Phillips Academy and in 1955 became an alumni at Princeton University along with a classmate Ralph Nader. For 12 years, Adkins served in the US Navy starting from Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps and climbing up the ranks to a naval officer on the USS Salem and even serving on a flagship of the US Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean waters. While there, he also received training in Naval Justice School, served on various vessels as court marshal, and later became attendee of the Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. Following his service, Adkins returned to Columbia, where in 1958 he got his master's degree in psychology. Career In 1963, after obtained his doctorate in counseling psychology from Teachers College, Columbia University, Adkins immediately joined its faculty in order to work on his Career Pattern Study. For one year, he moved to Harvard University where he spent at its Center for Personality, studying achievement motivation with David McClelland. After his short lived Harvard appointment, Atkins indulged into War on Poverty and worked with YMCA of the City of Greater New York. In 1966, Adkins became a founding faculty member of the York College, City University of New York, where he supervised the Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge project. The project later turned into a program whose goal is to provide support for low income students. The program is still used today by the City University System. During the next 30 years, Adkins worked at Teachers College, Columbia University and at the Institute for Life Coping Skills, where he developed new methods for helping people to deal with complex attitudes and behaviors they might encounter in their everyday life. His major focus was the development of multi-media counseling systems. Adkins then worked with Paul Sharar and Sidney Rosenberg to develop Training Resources for Youth, a program that was implemented by 2,000 agencies in 40 states ever since its founding in late 1970s. During his career, Adkins trained many graduate students on how to develop psychological and behavioral interventions, using his methods and theory. He served on many non-profit boards of directors, including the HOPE Program for the homeless, the NYS Advisory Group on Adult Education, the Greenwich Adult and Continuing Program and the Center for Insurance Research, and was a founding member of the Princeton Project '55 Center for Civic Leadership. =ASLP= Adkins is better known as a pioneer behind the Adkins Life Skills Career Development Program (ASLP), which was originally published by Psychological Corporation, a division of Harcourt Assessment. The program, which besides English comes in Spanish and Italian languages, helped over 1 million people to obtain degrees (and later jobs). The program was used by over 2,000 agencies in 45 states, which includes such facilities as prisons, homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers, welfare-to-work programs, economic opportunity centers and community colleges. Based on the program, the Institute for Life Coping Skills had trained over 5000 staff as Life Skills Educators who promoted the program in their own agencies. Later on, as many as 200 community colleges in India had adopted the Life Coping Skills curriculum which was used in their country to help students from rural provinces learn how to understand urban life. Death and personal life Adkins died following lung surgery at the age of 82. He was married to professor emerita, Caroline Manuele Adkins, who is also a psychologist. Together they raised a son, Jason and daughter, Jennifer.

It is described as his \\"most famous sculpture\\".  Background  The Venezuelan architect and designer Carlos Ra√∫l Villanueva began designing the University City of Caracas campus in the 1940s, beginning construction in the 1950s during a time of prevailing Modernism in Latin America. Villanueva hired many artists from around the world to contribute works to the campus, including Laurens. Laurens had not had formal art training, and began his career as a stonemason, exploring Cubism from around 1912.  Design and construction  Villanueva reportedly asked, in 1952, for Laurens to build him something \\"tremendous\\" for his campus project; later that year, he began creating L'Amphion. The sculpture is over 4 metres tall and rendered in bronze, sitting on top of a stone block. Laurens died in 1954, shortly after completing L'Amphion. A copy of the sculpture exists at the Dallas Museum of Art.  Appearance  L'Amphion is seen as a product of Laurens' development of style, an evolution between Cubist and Curvilinear art forms. It is also indicative of the female form that many of Laurens' more curving sculptures represent. Though made of bronze, the sculpture is a \\"grayish-black\\" shade. The consistency of the material is solid, except for an area on the front where there are decorative stripes on the 'belly'. The shape is based on the Greek mythological Amphion. Annette Labedzki refers to the sculpture as a feminine form, but with smooth curves that give \\"a mermaid like appearance\\", and describes it as having \\"its two hands raised and joined to form a circular shape, resembling a dancing gesture\\".

The mill was built in 1873 as a classic Dutch-type mill, with a four- blade wind wheel and a revolving roof. After a windstorm damage, the original owner and builder Cyril Wagner decided to modernize the mill. He installed the so-called Halladay turbine instead of the classic wind wheel. The turbine was named after its inventor and designer, the American farmer Daniel Halladay. The runner consists of a chain of operable vanes controlled by rods, enabling them to be tilted as required automatically according to the wind. Double tail vane maintained the wheel at the right course. The turbine is now rotating at a height of 16 m above the ground, its diameter is 10 m and it weighs about 2 tons. The mill still has the original mill machines. Even though grinding stopped in the 1960s the roof turbine is still in operation. The mill was completely restored in 1998 and is open to the public.  Recognition  It was declared a Czech cultural monument in 1958. In autumn 2009, a postage stamp depicting the mill was issued . The stamp with a face value of CZK 10 was designed by Petr Melan, engraved by V√°clav Fajt.

She played a key role in Manhattan's drag bar scene in the middle of the 20th century. Genovese is the subject of the 12-episode podcast Mob Queens (2019), hosted by writers Jessica Bendinger and Michael Seligman, who had researched her life from 2014 to 2018 after discovering a stash of old letters in 2014. Early life Genovese was born Giovaninna \\"Anna\\" Petillo, the eldest child of Italian-Catholic immigrants, Aniello Vincenzo Petillo from Risigliano, Naples, and Concetta y Cassini Genovese, a cousin of Vito's. His brother Carmine lived with the Petillos after immigrating in 1910. Her siblings were Nicolas, Peitra, Ferdinand, and Mario Petillo. She has been erroneously listed as a sibling to mobster David Petillo; they were cousins. In the spring of 1924, at age 19, Genovese married her first husband, Gerard \\"Gerry\\" Vernotico. According to Kate Harmon, Genovese's great niece, to whom the Mob Queens researchers spoke and have on record at 10:55 in Chapter 1 of their podcast, Anna's marriage \\"was not looked upon kindly\\" by her family as Vernotico was considered a man of little means; a census record notes that he was a carpenter, though in reality he was a baker in New York City's Little Italy. In 1927, Genovese and Vernotico had a daughter, Marie, and moved a few blocks north of Anna's West Houston Street home to a tenement apartment next to an elevated train on Sixth Avenue in Greenwich Village. In a 1930 census, she is listed as a housewife, and Gerard as a carpenter, though grand-niece Harmon states that Gerard was in fact a baker at a bakery in Little Italy and \\"had nothing.\\" Court records show that at the same time, Anna had been working evenings in one of the clubs in the Washington Square Park neighborhood, near or in Greenwich Village. Marriage to Vito Genovese It is thought that Vito Genovese, a fourth cousin of Anna's, was responsible for or involved with the murder of Gerard Vernotico in March 1932. Two weeks later, Anna and Vito, whose first wife had also just died, were married. Anna was six months pregnant. The couple's first luxury apartment was located at 43 Fifth Avenue, a decadent Beaux Arts building, completed in 1905, with limestone pillars, a marble lobby, and wrought-iron balconies. The building would later be a place of residence for Marlon Brando. Two years into their marriage, Vito killed gangster Ferdinand \\"The Shadow\\" Boccia. A year later, in 1935, Vito bought Deep Cut, a 1928 mansion on a property in Middletown Township, New Jersey. Around the same time, New York Special Prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey started cracking down on organized crime, which bode poorly for Vito once Boccia's body was pulled from the Hudson River in 1937, as one of the hit men he hired for the job admitted to police that the commission had come from Vito. Standing accused of the Boccia murder and other crimes, such as racketeering, Vito decided to flee the U.S., leaving the bulk of his business up to Anna. She was left to help formulate a source of revenue for the crime family at a time when most in the nation were struggling severely, as it was mid-Great Depression. At this vital time, Anna's path intersected with an unexpected set of social phenomena: the repeal of Prohibition, but the institutionalization of \\"Gay Prohibition,\\" during which it became common practice for law enforcement officers to stalk, harass, entrap, and arrest people in‚Äîor suspected to be in‚Äîthe LGBTQ+ community. It was not uncommon for queer people or those suspected as such to be removed from bars, and, moreover, for bars to be raided when suspected homosexual activity was being condoned. Bars could even lose their liquor licenses for serving gay patrons. It was all the more risky and rebellious for Anna to create havens for queer people, but she took on the effort, ultimately effectively blocking police efforts to persecute the LGBTQ+ community, her means being the power and influence of the mob. Business ventures While raising three children (her biological daughter with Gerard, Marie; Nancy, Vito's daughter with the late Donata Ragone; and Phillip, her son with Vito), Anna also ran nightclubs and gay and drag bars in Lower Manhattan, whose profits she siphoned to the crime syndicate and Vito, exiled in Italy, who invested in Benito Mussolinin's fascist party and cocaine for Mussolini's son. =Club Caravan= Anna's first club, Club Caravan, opened in 1939 at 578 West Broadway. Singers and other kinds of performers provided the entertainment, individuals like drag king Malvina Schwartz, also known as Buddy \\"Bubbles\\" Kent, whose 1983 Lesbian Herstory Archives oral history chronicles her time spent there. Anna later testified against her own club when she appeared in Freehold, New Jersey's Superior Court in 1953. She also named Club Savannah and Moroccan Village, run by other mobsters, but the latter as one of her husband's hang-outs. =Club 82= While Vito was in hiding abroad, Anna became hostess of Club 82, a gay bar located at 82 E. 4th St., between Second Avenue and the Bowery in Manhattan, which started in October 1950. There, Anna cultivated a vibrant gay scene. The club's tagline was \\"Who's No Lady,\\" and its drag revues featured both male and female impersonators. Kitt Russell, dubbed ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äôs top femme mimic‚Äù by Walter Winchell, hosted many of the shows, and countless acts performed in them, such as female impersonators Sonne Teal, Kim Christy, and Mel Michaels. Revues were long and elaborate, replete with sets and costumes, and with titles like Sincapades of 1954, A Vacation in Color, Fun-Fair for '57, and Time Out for Fun. According to Anna's eldest grandson, Frank, at 4:38 in Chapter 12 of Mob Queens, Anna supported show biz acts in their nascence, such as Barbra Streisand. The venue would later come under investigation with a potential loss of its liquor license, allegedly orchestrated by vindictive Vito to spite Anna. In testifying against her own clubs, Anna stated that the Club 82 was gang-owned. Her testimony ostensibly served to shift the blame from solely herself to her husband Vito's associates who had presided over, and allegedly monitored her activities running the club, while Vito was in exile in Italy. The State Liquor Authority had previously revoked Club 82's liquor license on account of \\"disorderly conduct,\\" which was code at the time for infractions involving things like serving alcohol to gay people, or people suspected of being gay. Anna left the club in the late 1960s in order to focus more on her family, but the venue lasted into the 1970s. =The 181 Club= Anna was a co- owner and proprietor, with gangster Steven Franse, of the 181 Club, known as \\"The East Side's Gayest Spot\\" and \\"the homosexual Copacabana\\". According to Franse's Supreme Court appellate testimony, his niece, Emily, was a part-time bookkeeper there. It was a gay cabaret venue and drag queens such as Buddy \\"Bubbles\\" Kent, who had worked at Anna's Caravan Club, also worked at the 181. It would eventually lose its liquor license and be labeled \\"a hangout for perverts of both sexes\\" in reference to its gay performers and clientele. Separation from Vito Genovese By 1940, Vito had been in exile from the United States for seven years. Finally, he was extradited back to the States and was placed in custody, standing accused of the 1934 murder of Ferdinand \\"The Shadow\\" Boccia. However, after two key witnesses were found dead, the authorities had no choice but to free Vito, under which circumstances he was reunited with Anna. He then instigated a move from Manhattan to Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, where they lived luxuriously, but summarily ending Anna's club career.Blackwell, Jon. Notorious New Jersey: 100 True Tales of Murders and Mobsters, Scandals and Scoundrels, p. Rutgers University Press, 2007. . Accessed January 29, 2020. \\"The mob leader resumed control of his rackets and settled himself again in New Jersey, this time from a plush homestead in the Shore town of Atlantic Highlands. There, Vito and Anna Genovese dined on gold and platinum plates and enjoyed what was hardly a conventional Mafia marriage.\\" Anna had walked out on Vito in 1950. She then asked, in court, for $200 per week in maintenance, which meant alimony without the divorce. However, she dropped the divorce suit in 1951. Testimony in open court In order to escape the domestic violence she said she was experiencing at the hands of Vito, Anna resumed her efforts to rid herself of him. On March 2, 1953, at the Freehold County Courthouse, Anna testified against Vito in court‚Äîopen court, an unheard-of move for any mob wife. She asked the judge for $350/week (approximately $160,000 per year, adjusted for inflation in 2019's money). Vito filed a counter-suit for divorce on the grounds of desertion. Both claims were ultimately dismissed in the New Jersey Superior Court appellate division. Anna had testified that the family had been involved in narcotics trafficking, casinos, labor rackets, dog and horse- racing, and other criminal activities. She claimed that she managed gambling ventures which generated an income of $30,000 per week. She also stated that she was the only one with the combination to the family safe in New Jersey. She described her many trips to Italy, delivering large sums of money to Vito while he remained in exile. Additionally, Anna implicated other major mob figures like Frank Costello and Albert Anastasia; as Anna's life would have been endangered due to her betrayal of so many dangerous people (she stated in her testimony that she had \\"been afraid to tell about Genovese's crime career in the past because he threatened her with death\\"), it is surmised that she might have been promised law enforcement protections in exchange for her testimony. It is also theorized that due to her sexuality‚Äîbisexual or gay, socially and legally verboten at the time‚Äîshe was being blackmailed into revealing so much information of such weight; Vito possibly being aware of her predicament, he would have possibly, ironically, forgiven her. According to Anna Genovese, Vito Genovese ruled the Italian lottery in New York and New Jersey, bringing in over $1 million per year, owned four Greenwich Village night clubs, a dog track in Virginia, and other legitimate businesses. Amidst the revelations, it is believed that Anna also had the intention of publicly shaming Vito by insinuating that Frank Costello, his rival, had more power than he did, part of the proof being that she had faith Costello's branch would offer her protection once she left Vito. It is again surmised that Anna had immunity in testifying, as law enforcement and the courts would not have allowed her to walk free after admitting her role in the copious crimes committed. In counter-testimony, Vito's witnesses attempted to discredit Anna's character. She was characterized as an \\"untrustworthy, hot-tempered\\" woman who slept with other women. As it was the height of the Red Scare and Lavender Scare in the United States, the characterization of Anna's behavior would serve to undermine her claims. Dorothy Kilgallen reportage Dorothy Kilgallen, the most syndicated newspaper columnist at the time of the trial, began reporting on the case, recording live with \\"If I were Mrs. Vito Genovese, I'd be awful careful crossing streets.\\" It turned out that Kilgallen was close with gangster Frank Costello, a rival of Vito Genovese. According to Kilgallen's biographer, Mark Shaw, the friendship was marked by Costello gifting Kilgallen with a diamond cross, which Kilgallen's hairdresser corroborated.

That, or switch allegiances from the Genovese crime family to the Costello syndicate. Sexuality According to drag king Malvina Schwartz, also known as Buddy \\"Bubbles\\" Kent, who worked in Anna's clubs, has stated in her Lesbian Herstory Archives interview that Anna was \\"definitely into the girls.\\" Additional insight had been given by Henry \\"Adrian\\" Oranco, a drag queen who worked under Anna's supervision at Club 82. He has stated that Anna was romantically involved with a drag king named Duke, whose given name was Jackie. As a token of love, Jackie, Anna's \\"girlfriend,\\" as Oranco calls her in Chapter 9 of Mob Queens, received a Cadillac. In Chapter 6 of the Mob Queens podcast, Anna's granddaughter, Mia, confirms that the two were romantically involved, Mia having met Jackie the day that Anna died. Also confirmed by Mia was Anna's romantic involvement with a woman named Gwen Saunders, a cashier at one of Anna's clubs. Death At the end of her life, Anna worked at the upper-crust Warwick Hotel in guest relations. According to Anna's granddaughter, Mia, Cary Grant was living at the hotel at the time and he and Anna became good friends. Mia speaks to this point at 5:23 in Chapter 12 of Mob Queens. Thirteen years later, in January 1982, Anna had, in the words of Mia in Mob Queens Chapter 12, \\"a very significant stroke.\\" She was hospitalized at St. Vincent's, where she died surrounded by her lover, Jackie, daughter Marie, and granddaughter, Miarecounted by Mia at 26:36, also in Chapter 12.

Early life Woodward was born Mabel DeLong in 1897 near Wallula, Washington to a shoeshop owner and his wife. Since being introduced to horses at age 3 by her father, she trained on them consistently thereafter. She had a natural ability with horses. A nearby trick rider named Bill Donovan trained her. In 1913, she entered the Walla Walla Stampede and won the trick riding three years in a row, from 1913 to 1915. She then joined Drumhellers Wild West Productions. When rodeo champion Hugh Strickland met her, he found her to be a petite and attractive woman. In 1918, they were married. They had one daughter. Career Starting in 1916, Woodard competed in professional rodeo, with men, for 25 years. She competed in every event except bulldogging, or steer wrestling as it is known today. One year at Cheyenne Frontier Days in Cheyenne, Wyoming, she won the all-around title. The next year after that, she came back to Cheyenne and won every event she entered. She also performed trick riding, winning many events, and even making several appearances at Madison Square Garden. Death and legacy Woodard died in Phoenix, Arizona, near her home of Buckeye, Arizona, where she had lived for the last 27 years. She died on Saturday, January 3, 1976. She had moved here with her second husband, Samuel Woodward. She had currently been the director of the Appaloosa Horse Club. She was inducted into the Pendleton Round-Up and Happy Canyon Hall of Fame in 1971. She was inducted into the Rodeo Hall of Fame of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum in 1981.

Many of the higher-dimensional algebraic structures are noncommutative and, therefore, their study is a very significant part of nonabelian category theory, and also of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT), which generalises to higher dimensions ideas coming from the fundamental group.https://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407275 Nonabelian Algebraic Topology by Ronald Brown. 15 Jul 2004 Such algebraic structures in dimensions greater than 1 develop the nonabelian character of the fundamental group, and they are in a precise sense ‚Äòmore nonabelian than the groups'.http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2009/06/nonabelian_algebraic_topology.html Nonabelian Algebraic Topology posted by John Baez These noncommutative, or more specifically, nonabelian structures reflect more accurately the geometrical complications of higher dimensions than the known homology and homotopy groups commonly encountered in classical algebraic topology. An important part of nonabelian algebraic topology is concerned with the properties and applications of homotopy groupoids and filtered spaces. Noncommutative double groupoids and double algebroids are only the first examples of such higher-dimensional structures that are nonabelian. The new methods of Nonabelian Algebraic Topology (NAAT) \\"can be applied to determine homotopy invariants of spaces, and homotopy classification of maps, in cases which include some classical results, and allow results not available by classical methods\\". Cubical omega-groupoids, higher homotopy groupoids, crossed modules, crossed complexes and Galois groupoids are key concepts in developing applications related to homotopy of filtered spaces, higher- dimensional space structures, the construction of the fundamental groupoid of a topos E in the general theory of topoi, and also in their physical applications in nonabelian quantum theories, and recent developments in quantum gravity, as well as categorical and topological dynamics. Further examples of such applications include the generalisations of noncommutative geometry formalizations of the noncommutative standard models via fundamental double groupoids and spacetime structures even more general than topoi or the lower-dimensional noncommutative spacetimes encountered in several topological quantum field theories and noncommutative geometry theories of quantum gravity. A fundamental result in NAAT is the generalised, higher homotopy van Kampen theorem proven by R. Brown, which states that \\"the homotopy type of a topological space can be computed by a suitable colimit or homotopy colimit over homotopy types of its pieces'. A related example is that of van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories.Ronald Brown and George Janelidze, van Kampen theorems for categories of covering morphisms in lextensive categories, J. Pure Appl. Algebra. 119:255‚Äì263, (1997) Other reports of generalisations of the van Kampen theorem include statements for 2-categorieshttps://web.archive.org/web/20050720094804/http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/stevel/papers/vkt.ps.gz Marta Bunge and Stephen Lack. Van Kampen theorems for 2-categories and toposes and a topos of topoi . Important results in higher-dimensional algebra are also the extensions of the Galois theory in categories and variable categories, or indexed/'parametrized' categories. The Joyal‚ÄìTierney representation theorem for topoi is also a generalisation of the Galois theory. Thus, indexing by bicategories in the sense of Benabou one also includes here the Joyal‚ÄìTierney theory.MSC(1991): 18D30,11R32,18D35,18D05  References    Notes  Category:Algebraic topology ","title":"Nonabelian algebraic topology"},{"id":"61928228","text":"Canzo-Asso is a railway station in Italy.

The travel lifts typically have two rectangular sides joined by a single spanning beam at the top of one end. The crane is mobile with four groups of steerable wheels, one on each corner. Boats are typically lifted using straps, slung between the two sides which can be passed under boats when either in the water or on the hard stand. Steel wires on pulleys are used to lift the boat. To remove a boat from the water, the boat is positioned in a narrow dock, or lifting well with two paths along each side, which are at the same level as the hard stand. The travel lift can then be driven onto the paths so that it is positioned over the boat. The boat can then be lifted above the level of the hard stand and driven around to the place where it is to be lowered.

They typically lift loads at around 1 m per minute and can be driven at speeds of up to 40m per minute. Boats need to be removed from the water for a variety of reasons including anti-fouling and removal of marine growth, maintenance and inspection and long term storage.

This class of graphs was introduced in 1982 by Martin Charles Golumbic and Clyde Monma, who used them to model scheduling problems in which the tasks to be modeled can share resources for limited amounts of time. Every interval graph is a tolerance graph. The complement graph of every tolerance graph is a perfectly orderable graph, from which it follows that the tolerance graphs themselves are perfect graphs. It is NP-complete to determine whether a given graph is a tolerance graph. However, because tolerance graphs are perfect graphs, many algorithmic problems that are hard on other classes of graphs, including graph coloring and the clique problem, can be solved in polynomial time on tolerance graphs.

The young male passenger was seen wearing a particular silicone mask in order to impersonate a white elderly person. The incident caused the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to issue a Terror Alert. Because of privacy concerns the CBSA and the Immigration Ministry would not reveal the man's name, or nationality. He was given the name Mr. X.  Investigation  After the flight arrived in Vancouver, the Canadian Border Services Agency investigated further into the incident where they noticed the difference between the passenger's appearance before and after using the airlines' facilities. The passenger was seen exiting the bathroom with no silicone mask, which ultimately exposed his original identity. His deception was discovered when he was observed transforming from an \\"old man\\" (albeit with uncharacteristically young hands) to a young man after a visit to a lavatory. It was suggested that there had been a boarding pass swap. The passenger's identity was not disclosed to the public. Despite this, Vancouver Officials announced that he was charged with \\"an unbelievable case of concealment.\\" The incident caused the governments in Hong Kong and Canada to review security procedures. Arrests Chau Pak-kin, 26, and Chan Wing-chung, 27 were accused of helping stowaways board flights to Canada. It was alleged that the two allowed seven passengers without the proper credentials to board flights from Hong Kong to Canada. In the Air Canada Flight 018 Stowaway Incident the 20 year old stowaway was referred to as Mr. X in the District Court. It was alleged that Mr. X used the identity of a US Citizen (whose date of birth is 1955) by obtaining the boarding pass through a \\"boarding pass swap\\". In a Hong Kong court, Chau Pak-kin was found guilty in the conspiracy to smuggle passengers. Eight other people were also arrested in connection with the incident. Chau Pak-kin was sentenced to three years in prison for his part in smuggling Mr. X.  Asylum for the stowaway  Because of the liberal refugee laws in Canada, Mr. X claimed asylum and therefore he could not be prosecuted for being a stowaway or for illegally immigrating into Canada. Mr. X was released on bail to a Chinese-Canadian person with ties to his family.

She was originally part of the cast of The Fundamental George as a maid, but she could not perform because she was ill. Helen Bonfils took over the role, but in blackface.

The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Early history= Palle Rosenkrantz K√¶rstrup is one of the oldest manors on Lolland and was originally located in a village by the same name which disappeared in the beginning of the Middle Ages. The first known owner was Anders Siundesen Mule in 1368. It was later owned by the G√∏ye family for many generations. The last member of the family to own the estate was Henning G√∏ye. He had studied eight yeatrs abroad, for instance in Wittenberg. He married Anne Skram, a daughter of Peder Skram, but they had no children. On G√∏ye's death in 1617, J√¶rstrup therefore passed to his sister-in-law, Karen Skram, the widow of Laurids Brockenhuus of Bramstrup and Egeskov. The next owners included Palle Rosenkrantz and Christen Skeel. In 1720, K√¶rstrup was acquired by Frederick IV (1671-1730) and included in Lolland Cavalry Fistrict. =Raben family= Christian Frederik Raben In 1725, the cavalry district was dissolved and the land divided into estates and sold in public auction. K√¶rstrup, Aalholm and Bremersvold were acquired by Emerentia Taben, n√©e von Levetzau, the widow of Johan Otto Raben, She immediately ceded K√¶rstrup and Bremersvold to her son-in-law Niels Rosenkrantz Schack but under the reservation that the estates would revert to the Raben family if his marriage with Sophie Hedewig Raben remained without children. Emerentia von Levetzau bought both estates back in 1732 after Niels Rosenkrantz Schack had passed away without children the previous year. On her death in 1746, K√¶rstrup and Bremersvold passed to her son, Christian Frederik Raben. He constructed a new main building on the foundations from the G√∏ye family'es buildings. Sophus Frederik Raben-Levetzau inherited K√¶rstrup and Bremersvold in 1820 but died just eight years later. His widow, Charlotte Emerentia Rosenkrantz-Huitfeldt, managed the estates after her husband's death with assistance from her nephew, baron Gottlob Rosenkrantz. She wanted to endow the estates to the nephew but this resulted in a legal dispute with the Taben family which had still not been settled at the time of her death in 1843. Two Supreme Court judgements in 1844 and 1850 ended up ceding both estates to the Raben family. =Later history= In 1852, K√¶rstrup was sold in public auction. The buyer was a consortium who the following year sold it to David Peter Friderichsen after first having sold the copyholds to the copyholders. Friderichsen managed the estate with great skill. His son, Mathias Wilhjelm Friderichsen, in 1851 sold the estate to Lennart Wilhelm Sponneck. In 1972, he sold it to Esper Boel. Architecture The rwo-storey main building was built with timber framing in 1765 but clad with brick in 1836. The vaulted cellars date from circa 1540. The centrally located tower on the facade was built in 1868 under supervision of the architect Ove Petersen. The building is surrounded by moats from the first half of the 16th century. The building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. The home farm and the bridge across the eastern moat was built in circa 1910.

Starting in 1945, he served for decades in the army under General Xu Shiyou, and became a decorated veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Civil War, and the Korean War. He later transferred to the Navy and served as Political Commissar of the PLAN from 1990 to 1993. He was awarded the Medal of Honour by President Xi Jinping and the Order of the National Flag by North Korea.  Republic of China  Wei was born in April 1927 in Wei Family Village (È≠èÂÆ∂Êùë) in Penglai, Shandong, Republic of China. During the Second Sino- Japanese War, he attended secondary school in the Jiaodong Communist Base from 1943 to 1944. In February 1945, he enlisted in the Eighth Route Army and served under General Xu Shiyou, the commander of the Jiaodong Military Area. After the Empire of Japan announced its surrender on 15 August 1945, the Communist forces in Shandong attacked Jimo, which was held by Japan and the puppet Wang Jingwei regime, in order to gain advantage over the Kuomintang forces. Wei participated in the battle on 26 August, when the Communists took over the city after a three-hour battle and annihilated the 34th Brigade of the Wang Jingwei regime. Soon after the Battle of Jimo, Wei was promoted to a company-level officer. Under the command of Xu Shiyou, he distinguished himself in major battles during the Chinese Civil War, including the Battle of Laiwu, the Menglianggu campaign, the Battle of Jinan, the Huaihai campaign, and the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. At Menglianggu, the 9th Column Wei belonged to was a main attacking force. It subsequently became the main unit of the East China Field Army (later renamed the Third Field Army). By the end of the civil war in 1949, Wei had been promoted to Chief of Staff of the Combat Department of the 79th Division, under the 27th Army of the Third Field Army.  People's Republic of China  A year after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wei joined the People's Volunteer Army to fight in the Korean War in November 1950. He continued to serve in the 79th Division of the 27th Army, and participated in the Second Phase Offensive and the Fifth Phase Offensive. After the Korean War, Wei served in the East China Military Region, which was reorganized into the Nanjing Military Region in 1955. Wei headed the training department of the Nanjing MR, before being appointed the secretary of Xu Shiyou, the commander of the military region. Having earned the trust of Xu, Wei was successively promoted to regiment commander, Political Commissar of the 179th Division, Political Commissar of the 60th Army, Political Commissar of the 12th Army (1978), Director of the Political Department of the Nanjing MR (1982), and Director of the Political Department of the PLA General Staff Department (1985). = PLA Navy = After decades of service in the army, Wei transferred to the PLA Navy in July 1985 to serve as the sole Deputy Political Commissar under Li Yaowen. He was awarded the rank of vice admiral in September 1988. In April 1990, he succeeded Li as Political Commissar of the Navy, serving alongside Commander Zhang Lianzhong. He retired in December 1993. Wei became an alternate member of the 12th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1982, and was elected a full member of the 13th and 14th Central Committees, serving from 1987 to 1997. He was also a delegate to the 5th National People's Congress.  Honours  Wei is a recipient of the Order of Liberation (Third Class). For his service in the Korean War, he was awarded the Order of the National Flag (Third Class) by the North Korean government. Before his retirement, he was awarded the Order of Friendship (Second Class) by North Korea in October 1992. In July 1998, he was awarded the Order of Independence (Áã¨Á´ãÂäüÂããËç£Ë™âÁ´†) by the Central Military Commission. In September 2015, the 70th anniversary of the surrender of Japan, Chinese President Xi Jinping awarded the Medal of Honour to 30 people who made major contributions to the victory over Japan.

The game was held at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, on March 26, 1973. The UCLA Bruins of the Pacific-8 Conference, who were seeking their seventh consecutive championship, were matched against the Memphis State Tigers (now known as the Memphis Tigers), who were playing in the national title game for the first time. The Bruins won 87‚Äì66 behind a 44-point effort by Bill Walton, who scored on 21 of his 22 field goal attempts. Background =UCLA= John Wooden was UCLA's head coach. The Bruins were coached by John Wooden, who was in his 25th season with the team. UCLA entered the 1972‚Äì73 season as the six-time defending national champions, and the Bruins were coming off of an undefeated 30‚Äì0 season in 1971‚Äì72. Five players on UCLA's roster later played in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Center Bill Walton was the Bruins' top scorer and rebounder, averaging 20.4 points and 16.9 rebounds. Forward Jamaal Wilkes added 14.8 points and 7.3 rebounds per game, while forward Larry Farmer and guard Larry Hollyfield also averaged more than 10 points per game. Other players included centers Ralph Drollinger and Swen Nater, forwards Dave Meyers and Vince Carson, and guards Tommy Curtis, Greg Lee, and Pete Trgovich. The preseason Associated Press (AP) Poll ranked the Bruins as the number one team in the country. UCLA's first game was on November 25, 1972, against Wisconsin; the Bruins won by a 41-point margin. In each of their first six non-conference games, all of which were held at Pauley Pavilion, they won by double digits; during this stretch, Pittsburgh was the only team to lose against UCLA by less than 20 points. An 85‚Äì72 victory over Drake improved the Bruins to 7‚Äì0, before Illinois became the first team to keep the final score within 10 points, as UCLA claimed a 71‚Äì64 win in their game on December 30. The Bruins' first game in 1973 was their Pacific-8 Conference opener at home against Oregon, which they won 64‚Äì38 to move to 9‚Äì0 on the season. Three conference victories followed, before UCLA prevailed in four consecutive non-conference matchups to run their record to 16‚Äì0. The first two non-conference wins were over teams ranked in the top 10 at the time of the games; 10th-ranked San Francisco fell 92‚Äì64 on January 19, while number nine Providence was defeated by 24 points. On January 27, UCLA posted an 82‚Äì63 victory over Notre Dame. It was the school's 61st straight win in men's basketball, breaking an NCAA record that had been held by San Francisco.Davis, pp. 389‚Äì391. The Bruins returned to conference play with a 79‚Äì56 win at 20th-ranked USC, and the team continued its winning streak into March; a triumph over California improved its record to 24‚Äì0. On March 3, Stanford played the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion and held them to a season-low 51 points. In their closest game of the season, UCLA managed a 51‚Äì45 win. The Bruins then won their regular season finale against USC to finish at a perfect 26‚Äì0; with a 14‚Äì0 mark in Pacific-8 games; they won the conference championship. UCLA maintained its number one ranking in the AP Poll for the entire season. UCLA received an invitation to the 1973 NCAA Tournament and was placed in the West region. In their first game of the tournament, the Bruins faced Arizona State, winning 98‚Äì81 to advance to the regional final against San Francisco. There, they won by a 15-point margin to earn a berth in the Final Four. Indiana was UCLA's opponent in that round, and the Bruins jumped out to a 40‚Äì22 lead at halftime. Although the Hoosiers went on a 17‚Äì0 scoring run in the second half and pulled within two points of the Bruins multiple times, UCLA won 70‚Äì59 to reach the title game.Davis, pp. 394‚Äì396. The team shot 58.5% from the field, as Walton had 14 points and Wilkes added 13. =Memphis State= Gene Bartow was the coach of Memphis State, having been hired by the university for the 1970‚Äì71 season. The Tigers' leading scorer was guard Larry Finch, who averaged 24.0 points per game on 44.5% shooting. Future NBA player Larry Kenon, a forward, also averaged more than 20 points per game, on 52.5% shooting, and led Memphis State in rebounding with 16.7 per game. Center Ronnie Robinson had 13.5 points and 11.2 rebounds per game. Other regulars included center Wes Westfall, forwards Ken Andrews and Billy Buford, and guards Bill Cook, Bill Laurie and Doug McKinnie. Memphis State began the season ranked 11th in the country, but the team lost three of its first five games. Following a season-opening win over Missouri Western, LSU defeated the Tigers 94‚Äì81 on December 5, 1972. A visit to fifth- ranked Marquette resulted in a three-point defeat, and an 80‚Äì79 loss to Texas left the Tigers with a 2‚Äì3 record. They evened their record at 3‚Äì3 on December 16, with an 80‚Äì51 victory over Navy. That was the start of an extended winning steak; after wins against Arkansas, Cornell, and UC Santa Barbara, the Tigers traveled to Vanderbilt for a meeting with a top-10 opponent. With a 74‚Äì71 road victory, Memphis State extended its streak to five games before the start of Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) play. Drake was Memphis State's first opponent in MVC competition. The Tigers were taken to double overtime by Drake, but earned a 97‚Äì92 victory. Subsequent wins against Bradley, Saint Louis, Louisville, and New Mexico State improved the Tigers to 5‚Äì0 in the conference. They were followed by the team's second contests of the season against Drake and Bradley, both of which they won; at this point the club's winning streak had reached 14 games. By late January, the Tigers had returned to being ranked in the AP Poll; in the February 6 ranking, Memphis State was listed at number 15. In the Tigers' next game, on February 8, Louisville ended their winning streak by an 83‚Äì69 margin. Afterwards, the Tigers won their next five games, all against MVC opponents, before losing to Saint Louis, 70‚Äì56, in their regular season finale. The Tigers finished in first place in the MVC with a 12‚Äì2 mark in conference play, and were 21‚Äì5 overall. Their final national ranking was 12th. Like UCLA, the Tigers received a bye in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. They defeated South Carolina in the Midwest regional semifinals by 14 points. Memphis State then posted a 20-point win over Kansas State to gain their Final Four spot. In the national semifinals, Providence opposed the Tigers and took a double-digit advantage before one of their leading players, Marvin Barnes, was forced to leave the game due to a knee injury. After trailing at halftime by nine points, the Tigers rallied to win, 98‚Äì85, and secure their place in the national championship game. Kenon led Memphis State with 28 points, while Robinson had 24 and Finch added 21. It was the school's first trip to an NCAA Tournament final, having never made it past the first round in three previous appearances. Game summary The St. Louis Arena was the site of the 1973 national championship game. Bill Walton (pictured in 1974) made 21 of his 22 shots in the game. The game was held on March 26 at the St. Louis Arena in St. Louis, Missouri, before a crowd of 19,301 fans. It was preceded by a contest between Indiana and Providence for third place. Behind a pair of 21-point efforts by Steve Downing and John Ritter, Indiana prevailed by 18 points, 97‚Äì79. The championship game was televised by NBC, which purchased the broadcasting rights to the 1973 NCAA Tournament for less than $1.2 million. Curt Gowdy provided play-by-play commentary for NBC, and Tom Hawkins worked alongside him as an analyst. Having been held on Saturdays in previous years, the 1973 title game was moved to Monday. It was the first basketball national championship game to appear in prime time, and received a 20.5 Nielsen rating; an estimated 39 million people watched the broadcast, the most ever for an NCAA Tournament game at the time. The telecast garnered a 36.0 rating in the Los Angeles market.Smith, p. 219. Memphis State began the game in a man-to-man defense, in which Kenon was the primary defender covering Walton, playing behind him.Davis, p. 396. The team's plan was to force Walton to play away from the basket, but his ability to use his strength to gain positioning rendered the strategy largely ineffective. Walton played a key role early on for the Bruins; of the team's first 10 points, he had six of them. Kenon led the Tigers in the first six minutes of the game, converting each of his first four field goal attempts. However, the Tigers' taller players were in the process of accumulating personal fouls. Kenon committed three fouls in the first 6:43 and was forced to the bench for an extended period. At this point, he had been responsible for 8 of Memphis State's 12 points. The Bruins built a lead as the first half progressed, taking a nine-point advantage at one time. Finch then helped the Tigers get back into the game with a stretch of eight consecutive points. Memphis State began utilizing a zone defense, and Kenon returned to the game; he was still positioned behind Walton defensively. The Tigers were helped by an accumulation of fouls by Walton, who picked up his third and came out of the game with 4:14 remaining in the first half as the Bruins retained a six-point lead. After his departure, the Tigers' offensive players found greater success, scoring eight of the next 10 points.Smith, p. 223. After the first half, the teams were tied, 39‚Äì39. Finch opened the second half scoring for Memphis State with two free throws, which gave the Tigers the lead. Walton responded for the Bruins with three field goals in a row. UCLA frequently sought to take advantage of a size advantage Walton held over shorter Memphis State defenders by having Lee throw lob passes to him. Much of Walton's offense came from these lobs, which often led to tip-ins. His scoring, which primarily came from near the basket, also resulted from layups and short jumpers, including bank and hook shots. The Tigers further varied their defense against him, at times putting a defender in front of Walton or covering him with two players, but were unable to keep him in check. Walton continued to be the focal point of the Bruins' attack, scoring all but 4 of their first 18 points in the half. Although the teams were tied 45‚Äì45 at one time, UCLA gradually gained control of the game as the second half progressed. The Bruins were up by four points with under 13 minutes left in the game when Walton drove to the basket for a shot attempt. Westfall fouled Walton, but was unable to prevent his shot from falling. His foul was ruled intentional, giving Walton two free throws that he made to extend UCLA's advantage to eight points with 12:24 remaining. Eight minutes into the second half, the lead had increased to 57‚Äì47. With 9:27 left, and the Bruins up 61‚Äì55, Walton committed his fourth foul. Instead of pulling him from the game, Wooden elected to leave him on the court and the Bruins subsequently extended their lead to 10. With under eight minutes on the clock, and the Tigers' deficit at 65‚Äì57, Walton recorded three quick baskets to push the gap to 12 points. For the rest of the game, Memphis State never trailed by less than nine points. Having been up by 11 points 14 minutes into the second half, UCLA pulled away in the final minutes of the contest, scoring 14 of the last 18 points. Walton was forced to come out of the game with 2:50 remaining due to an ankle injury, but by this time the Bruins had a 15-point advantage. The Tigers' Finch helped him off the court, and Walton received a standing ovation from the crowd. The Bruins won by an 87‚Äì66 margin to clinch the school's seventh NCAA title in a row and its ninth in a 10-year span. Statistical summary The Bruins scored on 40 of their 62 field goal attempts, for a percentage of 64.5%. Walton contributed 44 points on 21-of-22 shooting from the field. His effort broke the record for the most points in an NCAA Tournament championship game, topping the 42 points that had been scored by Gail Goodrich in 1965. Four further shots by Walton that went into the hoop were ruled out by officials because of an NCAA regulation that banned dunking; these were not included in his official statistics, and were recorded as offensive goaltending violations. In addition, he added a game-high 13 rebounds and two assists, along with seven blocks. Wilkes tallied 16 points; he joined Walton as the only Bruins players to finish with at least 10 points. Hollyfield had eight points and nine assists, and Lee topped both teams with a 14-assist performance. The Bruins' victory extended multiple winning streaks for the team. It was their 75th consecutive win overall; in the NCAA Tournament, they had a 36-game streak after their defeat of the Tigers. Memphis State made 42.1% of its field goal attempts, shooting 24-of-57. Finch converted on nine of his 21 shots and 11 of his 13 free throw attempts, scoring 29 points to lead the Tigers. Kenon added 20 points, and had eight rebounds and three assists, both team-high totals. The Tigers committed nine fewer turnovers than the Bruins, but were outrebounded 40‚Äì21, and their 11 assists were 15 fewer than UCLA compiled. Aftermath and legacy Walton scored a record 44 points in the 1973 NCAA title game. With Walton still on their roster as a senior for the 1973‚Äì74 season, the Bruins extended their winning streak to a record 88 games before a 71‚Äì70 loss to Notre Dame. Despite that defeat and a two-game losing streak later in the season, UCLA qualified for the NCAA Tournament and made it to the Final Four. There, North Carolina State defeated the Bruins in a game that ended in double overtime, leaving UCLA without an NCAA title for the first time since 1965‚Äì66. The following season, which was Wooden's last as UCLA's coach, the Bruins again reached the NCAA Tournament and won the championship game over Kentucky. Memphis State finished 19‚Äì11 in 1973‚Äì74 and did not receive an NCAA Tournament invitation. That was Bartow's last season with the Tigers. After one year at Illinois, he succeeded Wooden at UCLA and his 1975‚Äì76 team reached the Final Four. That season, Memphis State returned to the NCAA Tournament; it took another nine years for the Tigers to make another trip to the national semifinals. Having played against UCLA in the Final Four, the 2007‚Äì08 Tigers participated in the 2008 NCAA Division I championship game, losing to Kansas in overtime. Walton's 44 points remains the most ever scored in an NCAA men's national championship game. In 2016, Bryce Miller of The San Diego Union-Tribune said that he had given \\"arguably the single greatest performance in NCAA history.\\" Sports Illustrated writer Kelli Anderson listed his 1973 title game effort as one of the 10 greatest accomplishments in college sports. The magazine named it one of the \\"100 Greatest Moments in Sports History\\". Bartow remarked after the game, \\"We couldn't contain Walton.\\" He added that he had \\"never seen a player so dominating\\". Walton later said that he recalled his missed field goal attempt, which he rebounded and scored from. Wooden reportedly told him, \\"Walton, I used to think you were a good player ... until you missed that one shot.\\" Footnotes References Bibliography  NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game Category:Basketball in St. Louis Category:College sports in Missouri Category:March 1973 sports events Category:Memphis Tigers men's basketball Category:NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship Games Category:Sports competitions in St. Louis Category:UCLA Bruins men's basketball ","title":"1973 NCAA University Division Basketball Championship Game"},{"id":"61928744","text":"Pervomayskoye () is a rural locality (a selo) in Kyakhtinsky District, Republic of Buryatia, Russia.

Actions In 2015, Adalah Center helped free Abdel Khalek, a student detained for eight months after he arrived at a metro station at the end of a political demonstration that he knew nothing about, from imprisonment. Khalek's accidental arrival at the metro station led him into charges of belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood, demonstrating illegally, killing two students and attempting to kill a third. In February 2019, the Adalah Center, together with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), objected to the 20 February 2019 sudden executions of nine defendants without their families being informed and allowed to visit them, in violation of Article 472 of the Egyptian penal code. None of the nine defendants had had their personal lawyers present during questioning by the prosecution or during the trial, and eight of the nine had been tortured. The Adalah Center and EIPR described the 15 known executions in February 2019 up to 21 February as \\"part of the increasing use of the death penalty in trials that do not meet due process and fair trial standards, and a turn to increasingly vindictive application of the death penalty.\\" Repression On 29 September 2019 during the 2019 Egyptian protests, Adalah Center leader Mohamed el-Baqer was arrested at the prosecutor's office where he was present as the lawyer defending Alaa Abd El-Fattah, who had just been arrested earlier that day.

It started at Airbnb in October 2014 as a solution to manage the company's increasingly complex workflows. Creating Airflow allowed Airbnb to programmatically author and schedule their workflows and monitor them via the built-in Airflow user interface. From the beginning, the project was made open source, becoming an Apache Incubator project in March 2016 and a Top-Level Apache Software Foundation project in January 2019. Airflow is written in Python, and workflows are created via Python scripts. Airflow is designed under the principle of \\"configuration as code\\". While other \\"configuration as code\\" workflow platforms exist using markup languages like XML, using Python allows developers to import libraries and classes to help them create their workflows.  Overview  Airflow uses directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to manage workflow orchestration. Tasks and dependencies are defined in Python and then Airflow manages the scheduling and execution. DAGs can be run either on a defined schedule (e.g. hourly or daily) or based on external event triggers (e.g. a file appearing in Hive). Previous DAG-based schedulers like Oozie and Azkaban tended to rely on multiple configuration files and file system trees to create a DAG, whereas in Airflow, DAGs can often be written in one Python file.  Managed Providers  Two notable providers offer ancillary services around the core open source project. Astronomer has built a SaaS tool and Kubernetes-deployable Airflow stack that assists with monitoring, alerting, devops, and cluster management. Cloud Composer is a managed version of Airflow that runs on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and integrates well with other GCP services.
