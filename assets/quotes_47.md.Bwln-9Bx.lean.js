The film describes the takeover of a cell block in Prison Six by two inmates, both new immigrants from Russia, soldiers from the Golani Brigade, who were sent to prison for selling weapons to Hamas, and who were demanding a retrial. Background The original screenplay was inspired by true events. In 1997, there was a Rebellion in Prison Six, during which a number of inmates took over the dining room and captured several jail instructors and sergeants. Plot Bluchin, a fighter of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Golani Brigade, receives a notice that he is accepted for officers' training. He goes out to celebrate with his friend Glory. The two soldiers are new immigrants of Russian origin, with no relatives in Israel. Some time later, two men are arrested, charged and convicted of selling weapons to Hamas, which were used to carry out an attack in Hadera, which killed five civilians. The two fighters, who are perceived as traitors, do not want to lose their honor as fighters in the IDF, and request a retrial. But the military system is not interested and decides to release them from the army and transfer them to a civil prison to continue serving their sentences. This causes them to take over a cell block, take as hostages three of the prison's personnel and request a retrial. During these events, they confide in one of the prison staff, a woman soldier named Ilanit, that Bluchin did not sell any weapons, but had forgotten his personal weapon at a whore that he visited when they celebrated. To help him, Glory stole a weapon from the unit's arsenal and handed it to Bluchin, so the fact that he has lost his own weapon woulds not be known.

It is a semi-pelagic schooling fish widely distributed in the North Pacific, with largest concentrations found in the eastern Bering Sea. Name and differentiation In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revealed that the official scientific name for the fish was changed from Theragra chalcogramma back to its original taxon Gadus chalcogrammus, highlighting its close genetic relationship to the other species of the cod genus Gadus. Alaska pollock was long put in its own genus, Theragra, and classified as Theragra chalcogramma, but more recent research has shown it is rather closely related to the Atlantic cod and should therefore be moved back to Gadus, where it was originally placed. The change of the official scientific name was followed by a discussion to change the common name as well, to highlight the fish as a member of the cod genus. The common names \\"Alaska pollock\\" and \\"walleye pollock\\", both used as trade names internationally, are considered misleading by scientific and trade experts, as the names do not reflect the scientific classification. While belonging to the same family as the Atlantic pollock, the Alaska pollock is not a member of the genus Pollachius, but of the cod genus Gadus. Nevertheless, alternative trade names highlighting its placement in the cod genus, such as \\"snow cod\\", \\"bigeye cod\\", or direct deductions from the scientific names such as \\"copperline cod\\" (gadus meaning 'cod', from meaning 'copper', and meaning 'line') or \\"lesser cod\\" (from the synonymous taxon Gadus minor) have yet to find widespread acceptance. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration even states that \\"[the common name] might never change, as common names are separate from scientific names\\". In addition, Norwegian pollock (Theragra finnmarchica), a rare fish of Norwegian waters, is likely the same species as the Alaska pollock. Ecology The speckled coloring of Alaska pollock makes it more difficult for predators to see them when they are near sandy ocean floors. They are a relatively fast- growing and short-lived species, currently representing a major biological component of the Bering Sea ecosystem. It has been found that catches of Alaska pollock go up three years after stormy summers. The storms stir up nutrients, and this results in phytoplankton being plentiful for longer, which in turn allows more pollock hatchlings to survive. The Alaska pollock has well-developed drumming muscles that the fish use to produce sounds during courtship, like many other gadids. = Foraging behavior = The primary factor in determining the foraging behavior of the Alaskan pollock is age. Young pollocks can be divided into two sub-groups, fish with lengths below and fish greater than 60mm. Both groups mainly feed on copepods. However, the latter group will also forage for krill. Therefore, food depletion has a larger effect on smaller pollocks. The variation in size of each subgroup also affects seasonal foraging behavior. During the winter, when food is scarce, foraging can be costly due to the fact that longer hunting time increases the risk of meeting a predator. The larger young pollocks have no need to hunt during the winter because they have a higher capacity for energy storage, while smaller fish do not, and have to continue foraging, putting them at greater risk. To maximize their chances of survival, large pollock increase their calorie intake in autumn to gain weight, while smaller ones focus solely on growing in size. Alaskan pollock exhibit diel vertical migration, following the seasonal movement of their food. Although pollocks exhibit vertical movement during the day, their average depth changes with the seasons. Originally, the change in depth was attributed to the amount of light or water temperature, but in fact, it follows the movement of food species. In August, when food is abundantly available near the surface, pollocks will be found at shallower depths. In November, they are found deeper along with their planktonic food source.  Distribution  = Alaska pollock in the Pacific Ocean = The Alaska pollock's main habitats are the coastal areas of the Northern Pacific, especially the waters off Alaska (Eastern Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Aleutian Islands) as well as off Russia, Japan and Korea (Western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk). The largest concentrations of Alaska pollock are found in the eastern Bering Sea. = Small populations in the Arctic Ocean (Barents Sea) = Fish from the Barents Sea that was initially described as own species Theragra finnmarchica (Norway pollock), but is now known to be genetically identical to Gadus chalcogrammus (Alaska pollock). Very small populations of fish genetically identical to Gadus chalcogrammus are found in the Barents Sea waters of northern Norway and Russia. This fish was initially described as its own species under the taxon Theragra finnmarchica by Norwegian zoologist Einar Koefoed in 1956. The common name used for the fish was \\"Norway pollock\\". Genetic analyses have shown that the fish is genetically identical to the Alaska pollock. It is therefore considered to be conspecific with the Pacific species and is attributed to Gadus chalcogrammus. The history of the species in the Barents Sea is unknown. The initial specification as an own species by Koefoed was based on two specimens landed in Berlev√•g, northern Norway, in 1932 (hence the Norwegian name, ). Based on morphological differences, Koefoed considered Theragra finnmarchica a new species, related to but separate from the Alaska pollock. Just seven specimens of the fish are known to have been caught between 1957 and early 2002 in the Arctic Ocean. In 2003 and 2004, 31 new specimens were caught. All specimens were large ( in total length) and caught in the coastal waters between Vester√•len in the west and Varangerfjord in the east. By 2006, 54 individuals had been recorded. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA of two specimens of Theragra finnmarchica and 10 Theragra chalcogramma (today: Gadus chalcogrammus) revealed no significant genetic differences, leading Ursvik et al. to suggest that T. finnmarchica and T. chalcogramma are the same species. An analysis of a much larger sample size (44 T. finnmarchica and 20 T. chalcogramma) using both genetic and morphological methods led to similar conclusions. While the putative species could not be separated genetically, they showed some consistent differences in morphology. Only one characteristic showed no overlap. Byrkjedal et al. conclude that T. finnmarchica should be considered a junior synonym of T. chalcogramma. These analyses also suggest that T. finnmarchica is a near relative of the Atlantic cod, and that both Alaska and Norway pollock should be moved to genus Gadus. Norway pollock (Theragra finnmarchica) was listed as Near Threatened in the 2010 Norwegian Red List for Species based on criteria D1: \\"Very small or geographically very restricted population: Number of mature individuals\\". It is currently not listed in the IUCN Red List.  Fisheries  Global capture of Alaska pollock in tonnes reported by the FAO, 1950‚Äì2015 The Alaska pollock has been said to be \\"the largest remaining source of palatable fish in the world\\". Around 3 million tons of Alaska pollock are caught each year in the North Pacific, from Alaska to northern Japan. Alaska pollock is the world's second most important fish species in terms of total catch. Alaska pollock landings are the largest of any single fish species in the U.S, with the average annual Eastern Bering Sea catch between 1977 and 2014 being 1.174 million tons. Alaska pollock catches from U.S. fisheries have been quite consistent at about 1.5 million tons a year, almost all of it from the Bering Sea. Each year's quota is adjusted based on stock assessments conducted by the Alaska Fisheries Science Center. For instance, stock declines in 2008 meant decreased allowable harvests for 2009 and 2010. This decline led some scientists to worry that Alaska pollock could be about to repeat the collapse of the Atlantic cod, which could have negative consequences for the world food supply and the Bering Sea ecosystem. Halibut, salmon, endangered Steller sea lions, fur seals, and humpback whales all eat pollock and rely on healthy populations to sustain themselves. Alaska pollock stocks (and catch levels) subsequently returned to above average in 2011 and remained above average through 2014. However, Greenpeace has long been critical of Alaska pollock management, placing the fish on its \\"red list\\" of species due to damage of the seabed from trawling. Other groups have hailed the fishery as an example of good management, and the Marine Stewardship Council declared it \\"sustainable\\". The Marine Conservation Society rates Alaska pollock trawled from the Gulf of Alaska, Bering Sea, and Aleutian Islands as sustainable, but not those from the Western Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk. File:Pollock larva.jpg File:Juvenile pollock.jpg File:Alaska pollock 2.jpg File:Alaska pollock catch.jpg As food Compared to other cod species and pollock, Alaska pollock has a milder taste, whiter color and lower oil content. = Fillets = High-quality, single-frozen whole Alaska pollock fillets may be layered into a block mold and deep-frozen to produce fish blocks that are used throughout Europe and North America as the raw material for high-quality breaded and battered fish products. Lower-quality, double-frozen fillets or minced trim pieces may also be frozen in block forms and used as raw material for lower-quality, low-cost breaded and battered fish sticks and portions. Alaska pollock is commonly used in the fast food industry in products such as McDonald's Filet-O-Fish sandwich and (now-discontinued) Fish McBites, Arby's Classic Fish sandwich, Long John Silver's Baja Fish Taco, Birds Eye's Fish Fingers in Crispy Batter and Captain D's Seafood Kitchen. = Surimi = Single-frozen Alaska pollock is considered to be the premier raw material for surimi. The most common use of surimi in the United States is imitation crabmeat (also known as crab stick). = Pollock roe = Canned Alaska pollock roe, served on rye cracker (Russia) Pollock roe is a popular culinary ingredient in Korea, Japan, and Russia. In Korea, the roe is called (, literally 'Alaska pollock's roe'), and the salted roe is called (, literally 'pollock roe jeotgal). The food was introduced to Japan after World War II, and since has been called () in Japanese. A milder, less spicy version is usually called (, literally 'cod's roe'), which is also the Japanese name for pollock roe itself. In Russia, pollock roe is consumed as a sandwich spread. The product, resembling liquid paste due to the small size of eggs and oil added, is sold canned. = Use as food in Korea = Drying in winter Alaska pollock is considered the \\"national fish\\" of Korea. The Korean name of the fish, (), has also spread to some neighbouring countries: it is called () in Russia and in Poland, and its roe is called () in Japan, although the Japanese name for the fish itself is (). In Korea, is called thirty-odd additional names, including (, fresh), (, frozen), (, dried), (, dried in winter with repeated freezing and thawing), (, dried young), and (, half-dried young). Koreans have been enjoying Alaska pollock since the Joseon era. One of the earliest mentions is from Seungjeongwon ilgi (Journal of the Royal Secretariat), where a 1652 entry stated: \\"The management administration should be strictly interrogated for bringing in pollock roe instead of cod roe.\\" Alaska pollocks were the most commonly caught fish in Korea in 1940, when more than 270,000 tonnes were caught from the Sea of Japan (East Sea). It outnumbers the current annual consumption of Alaska pollock in South Korea, estimated at about 260,000 tonnes in 2016. Nowadays, however, Alaska pollock consumption in South Korea rely heavily on import from Russia, due to rises in sea water temperatures.

The name was changed in the 1940s to St Albans Grammar School for Boys and in 1975 to Verulam School. The school caters for boys between the ages of 11 and 19. Boys can stay on into the Sixth Form, which also welcomes male and female students from other schools. The school works in partnership with two neighbouring schools, Sandringham School and Beaumont School, to enhance post-16 educational provision. School performance An Ofsted inspection in October 2017 judged the school to be Inadequate. However, a Herts for Learning review in January 2018 rated the school Good and highlighted improvements in the areas criticised by Ofsted. A further inspection by Ofsted in July 2018 reached the conclusion that Safeguarding is effective and noted that the school had responded to the October inspection \\"with great urgency\\". In September 2018 the school joined the Alban Academy Trust. An Ofsted inspection in October 2018 judged the school to be Good. In a Kirkland Rowell independent survey of Parents in February 2020 89% of parents said they would recommend the school. Houses Prior to the school's turning comprehensive in 1975, there were four houses, named after the four streets forming a rectangle around the school site. These were Brampton, Hamilton, Jennings and Park. From 1975 onwards, with the increase in the yearly intake, two further houses were added, York and Churchill, also named after nearby roads. Extra-curricular The school participates in the Duke of Edinburgh award scheme, taking students through all of the phases from bronze to gold, with expeditions in places such as The Chilterns and The New Forest on Bronze, the South Downs and Dorset Coast on Silver, and Scotland, New Zealand and Morocco on the expeditions for the Gold award. The school runs a student Jazz-Swing band, the Verulam Big Band. The latter have gone on a European tour.

Diet The California whipsnake is known to eat a variety of live animals including insects, lizards, snakes, birds, and small mammals.Swaim KE (1994). Aspects of the Ecology of the Alameda Whipsnake (Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus). Upublished Master's Thesis, California State University, Hayward. 140 pp. It shows a strong preference for lizards, which are captured by a grasp of the mouth, and swallowed alive. Behavior Masticophis lateralis is fast-moving, diurnal, and an active forager. It commonly moves over and through brush and trees to avoid predation and to capture prey. The California whipsnake has been observed moving into the top of scrub plants after emerging from nightly retreats to gain access to direct sunlight before the sunlight reaches ground level. It is not venomous, but likely to strike if captured. Taxonomy As with many species and subspecies, taxonomic reclassification is an ongoing process, and differing sources often disagree. The genus Masticophis may soon be absorbed by the closely related genus Coluber, which contains the racer (Coluber constrictor). =Subspecies= Masticophis lateralis has two subspecies:Stebbins RC (2003).

The subspecies is often associated with broken (variable) habitat types that range from northwestern to extreme southern California and further south into Northwestern Mexico. *M. l. euryxanthus ‚Äî Alameda whipsnake :The Alameda whipsnake subspecies is endemic to California. The subspecies is considered threatened there. Its range is relatively small, and much of the subspecies' habitat is threatened by development. It was first collected by Archie Mossman and later described by Riemer in 1954. The Alameda Whipsnake is a threatened species of colubrid snake distinguishable by its broad head, large eyes, black and orange coloring with a yellow stripe down each side, and a slender neck. The Alameda Whipsnake is a wary creature known for its speed and climbing abilities utilized when escaping predators or hunting prey.

Born in Bradenton, Florida, United States. He lived in Sarasota, Florida, Washington, DC and near Atlanta, Georgia while growing up. Bewley attended the University of Georgia art school where he met Michael Lachowski, a fellow art student. They became roommates and decided to form a band. He and Lachowski, along with fellow art students Vanessa Briscoe Hay and Curtis Crowe, formed Pylon, having their first performance in 1979. On their first trip to New York City, they were reviewed in Interview Magazine. Bewley was a very influential guitarist and used the guitar to create not just notes, but interesting sounds as well. Pylon recorded three albums, three singles and one EP. The band has opened for U2, R.E.M., the B-52s, the Talking Heads and Gang of Four. Pylon broke up twice, but reunited and had been playing occasional shows. Pylon's first album Gyrate was reissued in October 2007 by DFA records. Chomp was reissued in 2009. Bewley was an art teacher for a while, but towards the end of his life devoted more time to his music and his own art. He also played with two other Athens projects: Sound Houses (formerly The New Sound of Numbers) and Supercluster. On February 23, 2009, Bewley was driving on Barber Street in Athens when he suffered a heart attack. According to the band's statement, his van drifted off the road and overturned. He was admitted to Athens Regional Medical Center and lapsed into a coma; he died two days later on February 25 when he was removed from life support. He was 53.

He showed unusual musical abilities at very young age and was soon hailed as a child prodigy. He studied piano at the Paris Conservatoire from 1829 to 1832 with Pierre Zimmerman and won first prize in piano performance at age 12 in 1831. He began touring Western Europe after leaving the Conservatoire, and in 1834 studied composition in Vienna with Carl Czerny as well as theory with Ignaz von Seyfried and Simon Sechter. At the end of the decade, he settled in Paris and married his first wife; his second wife, Andrea Lacombe (n√©e Favel), whom he married in 1869, was a singer. In Paris, Lacombe initially established himself as a virtuoso pianist, increasingly dedicating himself to composition and music criticism (his essays were partly reprinted in a posthumous collection, Philosophie et musique, 1896). Lacombe's first published works include a piano quintet, a trio, and some piano pieces. He wrote a number of dramatic symphonies with soloist and choir, and his cantata, Sapho, was performed at the Paris Exposition Universelle (1878). He wrote several operas, but only two were performed in his lifetime. La Madone was a modern composition with musical continuity through each act, elaborate orchestration, and only a small amount of spoken dialogue. However, the opening night response was described as lukewarm. Madame Boniface, a two-act comic piece, was performed in 1883, late in his life. Perhaps his finest work is Winkelried (1892), a four-act grand opera that premiered posthumously. Steven Huebner, writing in Grove, states \\"musically the score is worth more recognition than it has received. It betrays none of the influence of Gounod seen in so many French operas of the period. Though it is conservative in form, the orchestration and harmonic style are rich (...) Stirring homorhythmic choruses make Winkelried a fine vehicle for Swiss patriotic sentiment\\".

The topic is also of high importance to students, who invest their time and resources in support of the hope of earning a degree. Transfer rates are very high in the United States with 60% of all bachelor's degrees being awarded to students that began their college at another institution. Some transfer is planned; many community colleges have articulation agreements with four-year colleges. Other university systems have so-called feeder schools offering the first two years of the degree at a local campus with transfer into the flagship university in the junior year. Universities are now creating a number of new programs for students that help keep them engaged in their classes and involved on campus. This includes campus funded tutoring, freshman seminar courses, and intramural sports among many other things. These programs are important when it comes to campus life because it has been shown that student involvement is directly related to student success.Astin, Alexander W.. Achieving educational excellence. San Francisco: Jossey-Bass,1985. Print. When a student participates, he or she forms both social and emotional ties to the university that both encourage the student to do well academically and reduce the chance that the student will drop out of school entirely or leave for another university. Grades earned in a student's first semester are a very strong predictor of student persistence. For example, Budny, et al. in a longitudinal study of Purdue engineering students, show that first semester gpa is a better predictor of retention than SAT score. Also, first semester engineering students who earn a grade of A in Precalculus have the same persistence after 6 semesters as students whose first semester mathematics course was Calculus I and who earned a B, and these levels of persistence are also equivalent to students whose first semester course was Calculus II, and who earned a grade of C.Budny, D., LeBold, W., Bjedov, G. (1998). Assessment of the Impact of Freshmen Engineering Courses. Journal of Engineering Education, 87(4):405-411. A second study on the role of grades in first semester coursework supports the importance of first semester GPA, showing that the grade earned in English and mathematics courses are a strong predictor of persistence after one year, with the strongest predictor of returning corresponding to earning a grade of \\"A\\" in English, and the next strongest predictors corresponding to earning a \\"B\\" in English, or an \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" in mathematics. The level of course taken (for example, whether Calculus I or Precalculus) is less of a predictor of persistence at university than the grade earned in the mathematics class taken.Callahan, J.; Belcheir, M (2017), \\"Testing Our Assumptions\\", Journal of College Student Retention: Research, Theory \\\\& Practice, 19: 161‚Äì175, doi:10.1177/1521025115611620 This consideration is important for students who might, for example, have earned a passing AP Calculus AB score of \\"3\\" (as opposed to a higher score). For STEM majors that rely on Calculus I as a prerequisite, (e.g. engineering, physics and chemistry majors), these students with an AP AB score of \\"3\\" might consider retaking Calculus I their first semester at university and earning a high grade while also solidifying their calculus knowledge, and then taking Calculus II in their second semester. The economy also has a noticeable effect on retention rates. In general, tuition has been steadily climbing at universities since the mid-1980s. The cost of public and private institutions in the 1999‚Äì2000 school year, which includes tuition and on campus housing, averaged $7,302 and $20,277, respectively. After adjusting for inflation, this represented a 22% cost increase at public institutions and a 27% increase at private institutions for the 10-year period between the 1989‚Äì1990 and 1999‚Äì2000 academic years.Snyder, T., & Hoffman, C. (2001). Digest of education statistics, 2000 (National Center for Education Statistics, U.S. Department of Education, Office of EducationalResearch and Improvement Publication No. NCES 2001034). Washington DC: U.S.Government Printing Office. This rise in cost has made it difficult for many students and their families to pay for college. According to the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, tuition at a 4-year college represented 12% of the total income for families that fell into the lowest income bracket in 1980, and rose drastically to encompass 25% of their income by 2000.National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. (2002). Losing ground: A national status report on the affordability of American higher education. San Jose, CA. Print. This has created an influx of part-time students and working students. In the undergraduate population, 50% of students describe themselves as working primarily to pay for their education at an average of 25 hours per week.Riggert, Steven C., Mike Boyle, Joseph M. Petrosko, Daniel Ash, and Carolyn Rude- Parkins. Student Employment and Higher Education: Empiricism and Contradiction. Vol. 76, No. 1. American Educational Research Association, 2006. Print. This leaves working students little time to become involved on campus and actively participate in university life. Indeed, working-class students, who spend more time in paid employment, are significantly less integrated into university life than middle-class students. In spite of all of the programs and services to help retain students, according to the U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Educational Statistics, only 50% of those who enter higher education actually earn a bachelor's degree.Seidman, Alan. College student retention: formula for student success. Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 2005. Print. Though research is still needed in this area, it is becoming clear that there may be a link between the increased amount of working students and declining retention rates. Additional counseling is often available for financial issues. Private counseling and private tutoring are other options for students. Private corporations are looking into the business of student retention as a potential new field of revenue. This has led to problematic outsourcing strategies, such as the case of the University of Texas' system $10 million investment into the private company Myedu. Data on the amount of corporate lobbying addressed to the Board of Regents of State Universities is not available. At the same time, there is a great deal that administrators at the school and college level as well as faculty at the course level can do to improve student retention. For instance, in online courses where attrition has been reported even higher than in traditional face-to-face courses, faculty can strive to make connections and meet the needs of individual students.Dunlap, J.

After his playing days, he became a prominent cricket administrator, acting as secretary at Surrey County Cricket Club and being joint manager, with Pelham Warner, of the English cricket team in Australia in 1932-33 which became embroiled in the Bodyline controversy. As a cricket player, Palairet was overshadowed by his brother, Lionel, who played for the same two first- class sides and was regarded as one of the stylish batsmen of the 1890s and the early 1900s. Their father, Henry Palairet, played first-class cricket twice for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1868 and 1869. Richard Palairet's first-class record indicates that he was a useful right-handed batsman, but probably no more than useful: as a schoolboy at Repton he had been more successful than Lionel, but a soccer injury at Oxford restricted his movement and his fluency. He often opened the innings, though less frequently for Somerset, where his brother was ensconced at No 1, than for Oxford. In 112 first-class matches, he made exactly 4,000 runs at an average of 21 runs per innings; he scored only two centuries in a career that lasted 12 years. His highest was 156 against Sussex at the County Ground, Taunton in 1896 when he put on 249 for the second wicket with his brother, who made 154. In the winter of 1896‚Äì97 he was a member of a touring team to the West Indies led by Arthur Priestley; a second touring side to the West Indies that winter was led by Lord Hawke. After that tour, his appearances in first-class cricket became less frequent. Palairet played his last first-class match in 1902, but came back into the game as secretary of Surrey from 1920 to 1932. He stood down from that post to become joint manager on the Bodyline tour. He was president of Somerset County Cricket Club from 1937 to 1946. Education and military service Palairet was educated at Repton School before attending Oriel College, Oxford. He served in India including Waziristan (1917) between 1914 and 1919 with the 2nd Battalion Devonshire Regiment during the First World War. Palairet was promoted to captain in 1917.

Wilson (August 31, 1913 ‚Äì August 12, 2006 in Winchester, Virginia) was an American industrial psychologist who introduced the concept of 360 feedback surveys for management training and development applications. From 1970-1973 he developed his first 360-degree feedback survey, the \\"Survey of Management Practices\\". It was based on a learning sequence he called the Task- Cycle-Theory. Today, 360 feedback surveys of many types are standard tools for management training and development worldwide. Background Wilson studied under psychologist J.P. Guilford as a University of Southern California graduate student after World War II. Guilford had expanded on the work by Louis Leon Thurstone, pioneer in the field of psychometrics, by using factor analysis to assess management skills. Guilford‚Äôs work led Wilson to experiment with identifying important management and leadership skills through psychometrics. He eventually developed his Task Cycle assessment tools as an application of Guilford‚Äôs statistical approach. Wilson borrowed the concept of multi-rater feedback from the field of psychological assessment, particularly as it was being applied by the US Army during World War II. Managers and leaders, he believed, could learn and improve if they knew how others perceived their skills and behaviors. He also believed that management skills can be learned, like any other skill, through a learning sequence. While Wilson started out calling this system multi-level feedback, others eventually dubbed it 360-degree feedback‚Äîthe name by which it is now best known. It is also sometimes called multi-rater feedback. =Early Developments= He developed the Survey of Management Practices as a teaching tool for his management classes at the University of Bridgeport (Connecticut) Graduate School of Business, where he was the Warner G. Bradford Professor of Management. He had students use the survey in their workplaces. The feedback consisted of survey statements which were rated on a seven-point agree/disagree scale. The statements were strictly limited to observations about behaviors such as planning or communications, avoiding aspects of personality such as sociability or excitability. Each individual would rate him or herself on the same survey as the supervisor, direct reports, and peers who were also providing ratings. By the mid-1970s more companies, including Dow Chemical, Pitney Bowes and several utilities were using the instrument and contributing data to the norm database. With wider use and accumulated data, Wilson was able to study the reliability and validity of the instrument. He also studied performance data on feedback recipients and was able to verify a mathematical basis for the Task Cycle learning sequence. He found that when a manager or executive practiced the Task Cycle skills with balance and in sequence, a measurable increase in effectiveness could be documented.Performance Programs =Business= The Clark Wilson Group, formed in 1973, merged with TruScore (formerly The Booth Company) in 2017. The Task Cycle¬Æ line of assessments now consists of ten off-the-shelf offerings, with dozens of customized versions in circulation. =Research Conclusions= Up to the time of his death, Wilson continued to develop and publish a full range of assessment tools. He published his last book in 2003 at the age of 89. How and Why Effective Managers Balance Their Skills offers conclusions based on 30 years of research. Wilson summarizes: \\"After over 30 years of analysis, the problem of most managers is very clear. Too many managers try to exercise control without providing the technical and teambuilding skills needed to achieve their goals\\". This imbalance derails individuals and undermines organizational performance, he asserted, while the presence of these skills‚Äîwhich can be learned‚Äîmeasurably improves business outcomes. =Academic and Professional= Clark Wilson received his A.B. from Stanford University in 1935.

He was married in his first marriage to the famed French courtesan Esther Lachmann, known as La Pa√Øva, of Russian Jewish origin. Career Born in Breslau, Silesia, he was the son of Karl Lazarus, Count Henckel von Donnersmarck (1772‚Äì1864) and his wife Julie, n√©e Countess von Bohlen (1800‚Äì1866). When his older brother Karl Lazarus Graf Henckel von Donnersmarck died in 1848, his father transferred his numerous mining properties and ironworks in Silesia to Guido. Henckel also had a sister, Wanda (1826‚Äì1907), who married in 1843 Ludwig, Prince von Sch√∂naich-Carolath. Friedrich von Holstein claimed that the father of one of her sons was either a waiter or a coachman; \\"One must choose between the two,\\" Holstein wrote.Cited in Werner Richter, Bismarck, p. 259n. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1964. Henckel lived in Paris in the 1860s with his mistress (later wife), Pauline Th√©r√®se Lachmann, Marquise de Pa√Øva, known as La Pa√Øva, the most successful of 19th century French courtesans. He engaged in stock market speculations, and Otto von Bismarck sometimes found his shady contacts politically useful.Richter, p. 258. Henckel purchased for his mistress the Ch√¢teau de Pontchartrain in Seine-et-Oise.Pierre Levellois and Gaston d'Angelis (ed. dirs.), Les ch√¢teaux de l'Ile de France, pp. 170-172. Paris: Hachette, 1965. English translation of French edition of 1963. Like many other Prussian business and political figures, Henckel was a reserve officer, and during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 he was military governor in Metz and for competent for the to-be-annexed D√©partement de la Lorraine (1871‚Äì1872). During the negotiations for the French war indemnity in 1871 he advised Bismarck that France could easily pay itJames W. Gerard, My Four Years in Germany, p. 33. New York: George H. Doran Company, 1917. \\\\- and indeed, the indemnity payments were completed ahead of schedule in 1873. After Henckel's return to Germany with his wife in 1877, Bismarck occasionally entrusted him with discreet political or financial transactions. In 1884, for instance, Henckel arranged a loan for Bismarck's old friend, Prince Orlov, at that time the Russian ambassador in Berlin.Richter, p. 259. Henckel maintained a well-stocked game preserve on his estate at Neudeck in Silesia. When Kaiser Wilhelm II visited Neudeck for a shoot in January 1890, he was able to kill 550 pheasants in a single day.Giles MacDonogh, The Kaiser. The Life of Wilhelm II, p. 158. New York: St. Martin's Griffin, 2000. As an investor in the publishing company, in 1894 Henckel was unwillingly drawn into the dispute between the editor of Kladderadatsch and Geheimrat Friedrich von Holstein of the Foreign Office. In a series of anonymous articles the journal had held up to ridicule Holstein, Alfred von Kiderlen-W√§chter and Philipp zu Eulenburg. Kiderlen challenged the editor of Kladderadatsch to a duel and wounded him, but Holstein was not satisfied. He issued a similar challenge to Henckel, who maintained his innocence and declined to fight. Wilhelm II wisely refused to force Henckel to fight Holstein, for, years later, two junior officials of the Foreign Office asserted that they had been the authors of the Kladderadatsch articles.Virginia Cowles, The Kaiser, p. 121. New York: Harper & Row, 1963. Wilhelm II granted Henckel the title of F√ºrst in 1901. The same year he declined appointment as Prussian Minister of Finance upon the death of Johannes Miquel.Christopher M. Clark, Kaiser Wilhelm II, p. 98. Harlow, UK: Longman, 2000. In the years preceding World War I Henckel was estimated to be the second-wealthiest German subject, his fortune exceeded only by that of Bertha Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach. In 1916 he founded the F√ºrst Donnersmarck Foundation in Berlin with the donation of about of land and four million Goldmarks, an institution instituted to make scientific use of the experiences gained in World War I and to apply these insights in a therapeutic way, and now supporting the rehabilitation, care, and support of the physically and multiply disabled as well as research supporting that care. Marriages His first wife was Pauline Th√©r√®se Lachmann (b. Moscow, 7 May 1819 ‚Äì d. Neudeck, 21 January 1884), a courtesan better known as La Pa√Øva. They married in Paris on 28 October 1871. Besides the ch√¢teau of Pontchartrain, Henckel gave her the famous yellow Donnersmarck Diamonds - one pear-shaped and weighing , the other cushion-shaped and . Horace de Viel-Castel wrote that she regularly wore some two million francs' worth of diamonds, pearls and other gems. It was widely believed, but never proved, that La Pa√Øva and her husband were asked to leave France in 1877 on suspicion of espionage.Levellois and d'Angeli, p. 172. In any case, Henckel brought his wife to live in his castle at Neudeck in Upper Silesia. He had a second estate at Hochdorf in Lower Silesia. His second wife was Katharina Slepzow (b. St. Petersburg, Russia, 16 February 1862 ‚Äì d. Koslowagora, 10 February 1929). They were married at Wiesbaden on 11 May 1887. They had two children, Guido Otto (1888‚Äì1959) and Kraft Raul Paul Alfred Ludwig Guido (1890‚Äì1977) The prince commissioned a superb tiara for Princess Katharina, composed of 11 exceptionally rare Colombian emerald pear-shaped drops, which weigh over 500 carats and which are believed to have been in the Empress Eug√©nie's personal collection. The most valuable emerald and diamond tiara to have appeared at auction in the past 30 years, was auctioned by Sotheby's for CHF 11,282,500, CHF 2 million more than the highest estimate, on May 17, 2011 in Geneva.Sotheby's catalog No. 443 The Donnersmarcks' jewellery collection was known to be on a par with, or even to have exceeded, those of many of the crowned heads of Europe. Later life Henckel remained interested in political affairs even in the last years of his long life. Beginning in the winter of 1913-14 he had numerous conversations with US Ambassador James W. Gerard, to whom he described his role in the French indemnity negotiations of 1871. He expressed his long-standing support for a protective tariff on agricultural products as well as government encouragement of German manufacturing interests. Henckel proposed that Gerard should take his second son, then nearly 24, to America to see the great iron and coal districts of Pennsylvania.Gerard, p. 33. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Henckel advocated levying a war indemnity even larger than that of 1871.Gerard, pp. 33-34. In 1915 he joined F√ºrst Hermann von Hatzfeldt (head of the German Red Cross), Bernhard Dernburg, Hans Delbr√ºck, Adolf von Harnack and others in signing a petition opposing the annexation of Belgium.Gerard, p. 246. Seeing through the military's glib propaganda and increasingly anxious about Germany's growing war debt,Gerard, p. 34. Henckel von Donnersmarck died in Berlin in December 1916 at the age of 86. Legacy Following World War I, Neudeck passed to Polish sovereignty as ≈öwierklaniec; Hochdorf remained in German territory until 1945. Katharina F√ºrstin Henckel von Donnersmarck died at Koslowagora, today Koz≈Çowa G√≥ra, neighbourhood of Piekary ≈ölƒÖskie, in February 1929. A decade later, during the preparations for the German invasion of Poland, Guido's son, Guido Otto F√ºrst Henckel von Donnersmarck met with Oberstleutnant Erwin Lahousen of Abwehr (military intelligence) at Hochdorf on 11 June 1939 to offer the assistance of the entire forestry staff of his Polish estate. The offer was accepted.Heinz H√∂hne, Canaris. Hitler's Master Spy, p. 337. New York: Cooper Square Press, 1999. Originally published in 1979.

He has had a long and varied career, particularly notable for being the last manager of the East German national team. Playing career Geyer was born in Bielsko (Bielitz), during the German occupation of Poland. His family fled to Dresden after the end of World War II, and he began his football career with SC Einheit Dresden. In his youth was a goalkeeper, but he began his career playing as an attacker, later moving into defence. He joined Dynamo Dresden in 1968, where he played until his career ended in 1975 for health reasons. In total, he had played 112 games for the club, scoring twelve times, and was twice East German champion and won one cup. Coaching career Geyer moved into coaching, working with Dynamo's youth team, and assisting first-team manager Klaus Sammer, whom he succeeded in 1986. He won the DDR- Oberliga in 1989, ending Dynamo Berlin's ten-year dominance. He also reached the UEFA Cup semi-finals that year, before going onto manage the East German national team. His time in charge was to be short-lived, however, as the side disappeared with the reunification of East and West Germany. After a brief spell scouting at Schalke 04, he moved to Hungary, managing BFC Si√≥fok for a year before returning to Sachsen Leipzig. Under Geyer the team captured the NOFV-Oberliga (IV) title in 1993, but the club was denied promotion due when denied a licence to play in the Regionalliga (III) for financial reasons. He moved on a year later, joining Energie Cottbus where he enjoyed great success, advancing the previously unheralded club through two promotions into the first division Bundesliga. Under his direction the team was able to stay up for three years despite having a very small budget. He also took his side to the DFB-Pokal (German Cup) final in 1997. After relegation to the 2. Bundesliga in 2003, the team was unable to bounce back, finishing 14th in 2004‚Äì05, which spelled the end of Geyer tenure at Cottbus. He spent six months in the United Arab Emirates with Al Nasr, before returning to Sachsen Leipzig, initially as sporting director, but later as manager. He left Sachsen at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, due to financial problems, and returned to Dynamo Dresden three months later, hoping to spearhead their qualification for the 3. Liga or higher. They did qualify for the third division, but results were generally poor, and Geyer was sacked in June 2008. Lack of political correctness Geyer is well known in Germany for his outspoken manners. While coaches usually wrap critical statements in media friendly euphemisms, he's known to speak his mind in a very forthright manner. Examples include: \\"Manche junge Spieler haben eine Einstellung zum Leistungssport wie die Nutten auf St. Pauli. Die rauchen, saufen und huren rum, gehen morgens um 6 Uhr ins Bett.\\" (Some young players tackle the sport like the whores at St. Pauli. They smoke, they drink, fuck around and go to bed at 6 in the morning) \\"Die Fans wollen keine Spiele, bei denen man erkennt, dass manche Spieler nachher kein Deo brauchen.\\" (The fans don't want to see games where you can tell that the players don't need an antiperspirant afterward.) \\"Wer so doof ist, geh√∂rt nicht in die Bundesliga.\\" (Someone, who's so stupid doesn't belong in the Bundesliga.)

Church history St Clement's Church The parish church, dedicated to St Clement, is in the village of Withiel and dates back to the 13th century. The original church was apparently a nave and chancel only but it was rebuilt in the 15th and 16th centuries in granite. At this time a tower and spacious south aisle were added, and later a smaller north aisle, used as a chapel by the Bevilles of Brynn. The dedication to St Clement is not recorded before 1478; St Clement is portrayed on the font which is of this date. The church and manor of Withiel belonged before the Norman Conquest to the monastery of Bodmin; the monastery retained possession until 1538. The benefice was never appropriated and has always been a rectory. Thomas Vivian, Prior of Bodmin, was also rector 1523-1533; his arms are in the east window of the south aisle.The Cornish Church Guide (1925) Truro: Blackford; pp. 221-22 There are two Cornish crosses and a cross base in the parish. One of the crosses is at a road junction about a mile south of the churchtown and the other in the rectory garden.

It is found in central and eastern North America in productive waters. It is fairly tolerant of low oxygen concentrations and, as a result, it is sometimes the only, or one of a very few, fish species present in waters susceptible to winter or summer kill. Description The central mudminnow lives in slow-moving water around ponds, lakes, and streams in central North America, and ranges in length from 51‚Äì102 mm. It burrows tail- first in mud and can tolerate low oxygen levels, allowing it to live in waterways unavailable to other fishes. Its coloration matches this habitat, being brownish above with mottled sides and a pale belly.Philips, G. L., Schmid, W. D., Underhill, J. C. 1982. Fishes of the Minnesota Region. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis. It is eaten by many species of fish such as grass pickerel, sunfishes, northern pike, and catfishes; it is also preyed upon by birds, foxes, and snakes when caught out of water.Jenkins, J. R. and Miller, B. A. 2006. Shoaling Behavior in the Central Mudminnow (Umbra limi). The American Midland Naturalist 158:226-232. According to Paszkowski and Tonn, mudminnows perform better in environments with other fish species than in environments with just mudminnows, because the \\"interspecific interactions override a similar contribution for the mudminnow, which is regarded as a fugitive species\\".Paszkowski, C. A. and Tonn, W. M. 1991. An experimental study of factors affecting the distribution of yellow perch and central mudminnows along a species richness gradient. Environmental Biology of Fishes 33:399-404. Central mudminnows are known to eat a large variety of zooplankton and benthic and epiphytic macroinvertebrates. Adults are also known to feed energetically in the winter months on littoral fish.Robinson, J. M., Jirka, K. J. and Chiotti, J. A. 2009. Age and growth analysis of the central mudminnow, Umbra limi. Applied Ichthyology 26:89-94. One experiment conducted by Colgan and Silburt resulted in mudminnows typically feeding more on benthic than planktonic resources, with zooplankton making up only 0.7 of 511 items found in the stomach.Colgan, P. and Silburt, B. 1984. Feeding behavior of the central mudminnow, Umbra limi, in the field and laboratory. Environmental Biology of Fishes 10:209-214. This mudminnow uses a modified gas bladder to breathe air pockets trapped between the ice and water during the winter to feed and stay active.Currie, S., B. Bagatto, M. DeMille, A. Learner, D. LeBlanc, C. Marks, K. Ong, J. Parker, N. Templeman, B.L. Tufts, and P.A. Wright. 2010. Metabolism, nitrogen excretion, and heat shock proteins in the central mudminnow (Umbra limi), a facultative air-breathing fish living in a variable environment. NRC Research 88: 43-58. Distribution Umbra limi is a widely distributed species that inhabits many freshwater systems such as lakes, streams, and wetlands near the littoral zone, or near the shore, and around dense cover in central North America west of the Appalachian Mountains, including the St. Lawrence River, Great Lakes, Hudson Bay (Red River, and the Mississippi River basins from Quebec to Manitoba and south to central Ohio, western Tennessee, and northeastern Arkansas.Schilling, E.G., Halliwell, D.B., Gullo, A.M., Markowsky, J.K. 2006. First Records of Umbra limi (Central Mudminnow) in Maine. Northeastern Naturalist 13(2): 287-290. The central mudminnow has also been introduced into many of the tributaries in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Their habitats being marshy lands and rivers are under attack by human development and contact constantly and is likely causing a decline in their populations. Ecology The central mudminnow is carnivorous and typically feeds in the benthic area of freshwater habitats. According to Colgan and Silburt, it prefers amphipods, coleopterans, and anisopterans while avoiding zooplankton and other planktonic species. In a study by Colgan and Silburt, they found that an average of only 0.9% of the contents of dissected stomachs of U. limi contained zooplankton. Chironoids and gastropods, when taken from the dissection, had a combined volume of about 60%, which proves that the mudminnow feeds mainly in benthic areas. This fish seems to prefer water with low dissolved oxygen levels, warmer temperatures, and low flow. It is able to live in hypoxic conditions because of its ability to breathe air.Chilton, G., Martin, K.A., Gee, J.H. 1984. Winter feeding : an adaptive strategy broadening the niche of the central mudminnow, Umbra limi. Environmental Biology of Fishes. 10:215-219. This species is also known to feed in the winter in temperatures as low as 1.1 ¬∞C. According to Jenkins and Miller, some animals that feed on the mudminnow are the grass pickerel, sunfishes, northern pike, and catfishes; it is also preyed upon by birds, foxes, and snakes when caught out of water. This mudminnow is known to bury itself in the mud or sand to avoid capture in some situations. Also, Jenkins and Miller found that the mudminnow is a shoaling fish; they prefer to be with other mudminnows rather than by themselves. This shoaling mechanism seems reduce their predation risk. Life history The central mudminnow tends to spawn in mid-April in temperatures of 13 ¬∞C with the higher temperature stimulating the spawning. Spawning can take place in shallow waters and produce up to 2,500 eggs in one season. The average age of the central mudminnow is three, while they can reach ages of five or six. Females are typically larger than males when compared around age two. The egg stage is generally six days and then they enter the larval stage of development.

Although it was originally made in Sweden it is now built in Taiwan by Optimus. History C. R. Nybergs L√∂dlampfabrik Svea stoves were first made by C.R. Nybergs L√∂dlampfabrik, which also manufactured blowtorches as well as other machinery and equipment. Founded by Carl Nyberg, the firm later became one of the largest industries in Sundbyberg, Sweden. In 1922, the business was taken over by Max Sievert, an early associate of Nyberg's, and renamed Sieverts L√∂dlampfabrik (later known as Sievert AB).

Mueser, Long Distance Hiking: Lessons learned from the Appalachian Trail, p.58 (Ragged Mountain Press 1997) even under extreme conditions,F. Bouwman, The Practical Camp Book, p.84 (Horizon 1998) the Svea 123 enjoys a devoted following. The popularity of portable camping stoves such as the Svea coincided with the increase during the 1950s and 1960s in the awareness of the environmental impact of backpacking,C. Jensen & S. Guthrie, Outdoor Recreation in America, p.31 (Human Kinetics 6th Ed. 2006) particularly in heavily-traveled areas,S. Cox & K. Fulsaas, Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills, pp.123-24 (Mountaineers Books 7th Ed. 2003) and the rise of the leave no trace ethic in the 1970s and 1980s.A. McGibney, \\"Leave No Trace: A Guide to the New Wilderness Etiquette,\\" pp. 29, 31 (Mountaineers Books 2d Ed. 2003) At the same time, scarcity of fuel in over-used camping areas as well as regulatory requirements (open-fire bans) also contributed to the need for a substitute for open campfires for \\"wilderness\\" area cooking.M. Mouland, The Complete Idiot's Guide to Camping and Hiking, p.74 (Alpha Books 2nd Ed. 2000) Eventually stoves that were lighter in weight than the Svea, as well as those of other designs that were capable of burning a wider variety of fuels (useful when camping in other parts of the world where white gas is difficult to find) knocked it from its perch as one of the most popular backpacking stoves after nearly 50 years of production.C. Townsend, \\"The Backpacker's Handbook,\\" p.216, 221 (International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press 2d Ed. 1996) However, the rugged and durable Svea 123‚Äîoften described by long-time users as \\"bomb- proof\\"C. Latimer, Wilderness Cuisine, p.65 (Wilderness Press 1991)‚Äîstill remains popular and continues in wide use.A. Getchell & R. Getchell, \\"The Essential Outdoor Gear Manual,\\" p.96 (International Marine/Ragged Mountain Press 2d Ed. 2000)  Construction  Made of solid brass, the Svea 123 weighs about , measures and will burn for over an hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel. Later models (designated the Svea 123R and also sold as the Optimus Climber\\"Portable Fire,\\" Backpacker Magazine, p. 199 (March 1995)) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the burner jet from clogging by pushing soot or other impurities outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the burner jet manually by pushing the soot inwards. These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached. The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self- cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem. Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger joint configuration at the base. The pressure-relief valve in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened.R. Smutek (ed.), \\"Stoves for Mountaineering,\\" in Off Belay Magazine, p. 16 (Off Belay Reprint Series 1975). The pentagonal hole in the pressure relief valve is designed as a vent, not a key socket. The valve disassembles easily with a pliers. A brass windscreen attaches directly to the stove, and has built-in pot supports that fold inward for storage. The aluminum lid comes with a detachable handle and can also be used as a small cook-pot.Optimus Svea 123 Instruction Guide (undated), circa 1983.  How it works  =Stove lighting and operation= Svea 123 stove components To light the stove, the fuel tank must first be pre- heated and pressurized by lighting a small amount of fuel poured into the primer pan or spirit cup (a small well) on top of the tank at the base of the vaporizer (the vertical stem connecting the fuel tank to the burner). Alternatively, the primer pan can be filled directly from the fuel tank by opening the control valve and warming the fuel tank by holding it in one‚Äôs hands. This will increase the pressure in the fuel tank and force a small amount of fuel to trickle out of the burner jet and into the primer pan.Sievert Svea 123 Instruction Guide (undated), circa 1960. The control valve must then be closed before lighting the priming fuel so as to allow pressure to build up in the tank when the exterior fuel begins to heat the tank and the fuel within. The tank can also be pressurized by an optional pump that may be attached to the filler cap, but this is generally not necessary except in extreme cold. Fuel from the tank is fed by a cotton wick inside the tank to the base of the vaporizer. The heat and pressure created by the priming flame vaporizes the fuel inside the vaporizer. When the priming flame is nearly burnt out, the control valve is opened by turning the adjusting key. This allows the vaporized fuel to flow under pressure through the burner jet (a small opening at the base of the burner), where it mixes with oxygen and burns with a blue flame. Adjusting the flow of the vaporized fuel that is forced through the burner jet controls the flame size and heat output. The control valve (a spindle) is threaded in the vaporizer's housing, and as it is opened (by turning the adjusting key) it opens like a faucet (counter- clockwise to open and clockwise to close) and the vaporized fuel flows through the burner jet. Closing the spindle closes the fuel supply. A small plate on the top of the burner (a flame spreader) spreads the flame outwards. The heat generated in the burner and vaporizer maintains the internal pressure in the fuel tank.\\"Backpacking Stoves,\\" Backpacker Magazine, p. 47 (August 1976)Optimus Product Guide, p. 6 (undated; circa 1980) =Burner design and flame efficiency= Svea 123 burner design Like most gasoline stoves, the Svea 123 uses an inverted bell-shaped burner topped with a flame spreader (sometimes called a target burnerF. Saxon (ed.), \\"Tolley‚Äôs Basic Science and Practice of Gas Service,\\" p. 106 (Newnes 4th Ed. 2006) or plate burnerF. Saxon (ed.), M. Mouland, \\"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hiking and Camping,\\" p. 75 (Penguin Books 2nd Ed. 2000) design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes the bottom of the flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high fuel output levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the fuel output is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low fuel output levels, the fuel will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.R. Smutek (ed.), \\"Stoves for Mountaineering,\\" in Off Belay Magazine, pp. 16-17 (Off Belay Reprint Series 1975) =Internal cleaning needle= The cleaning needle on the Svea 123R model has two small toothed cogs that face each other, which cleans the burner jet from both the inside and outside when using the stove. The cleaning needle moves upward and downward when the spindle is turned; when the spindle is fully opened, the needle clears the burner jet's opening. As the spindle is closed, the needle retracts into the burner housing. In this way, any soot that may clog the burner jet is expelled.  Reliability  Because the Svea 123 is made of brass and has only one moving part ‚Äì the control valve (the later Svea 123R model has an additional moving part, the internal self-cleaning needle) ‚Äì the Svea has a well-established record of reliability and can withstand years of heavy use with only minimal maintenance.C. Townsend, \\"The Advanced Backpacker: A Handbook of Year Round, Long-Distance Hiking ,\\" pp. 161-62 (Ragged Mountain Press 2001) Some users have reported operational problems with the self- cleaning needle on the 123R, such as that the stove may not simmer as well as the earlier Sievert models,R. Wood, The 2 oz. Backpacker: A Problem Solving Manual for Use in the Wilds, p.94 (Ten Speed Press 1982) but reports from years of field use of the Svea on the Appalachian Trail indicate that it has the lowest record of clogging among stoves used on the trail. Some common but nonrecommended practices can adversely affect the Svea's performance and reliability. For example, when using a wind screen or shield other than the built-in wind screen (such as the flexible aluminum foil windscreens used with stoves made by Mountain Safety Research), care should be taken not to wrap the windscreen too tightly around the stove because this may cause the stove to overheat and the fuel tank to over-pressurize.\\"Stoves: Brand-Specific Hints,\\" Backpacker Magazine, p. 57 (March 1994) This in turn will cause the pressure- relief valve in the filler cap to open and the over-pressurized gas vapor to escape, which may catch fire and result in a dangerous \\"flareup\\" or large fireball.\\"Outfitting,\\" Backpacker Magazine, p. 101 (June 1997) In addition, while the Svea is capable of burning unleaded automobile gasoline, only naphtha or Coleman fuel is recommended: Coleman fuel contains rust inhibitors and is specially refined for use in camping stoves, while automotive fuel contains additives that vaporize when burned and leave gumlike deposits behind that causes clogging.\\"White Gas vs. Coleman Fuel,\\" Backpacker Magazine, p. 10 (December 1976) The stove should also not be allowed to run dry because doing so will burn or char the cotton wick inside the fuel tank, which will inhibit the wick's ability to draw fuel to the vaporizing tube.J. Fleming, The Well- Fed Backpacker, p. 53 (Vintage Books 3d Ed. 1985)  Similar designs and copies  The Svea 123 shares a number of design features with several other small portable stoves. Primus 71L stove In the 1930s, Sieverts L√∂dlampfabrik (maker of the original Svea 123) produced the Campus No. 3 stove. Much like the later-produced Svea, it was a self-pressurizing stove with an integrated windscreen and an aluminum lid that doubled as a cook-pot, but was slightly narrower and taller (80 mm x 150 mm) than the Svea. Because of its small size, the Campus No. 3 was advertised as a \\"boon to Hikers, Cyclists, and Travellers generally.\\"Svea Product Catalog, p. 10 (undated, circa 1935) Also in the 1930s, Optimus introduced the No. 6 stove, which was nearly identical to the Svea 123 in size, weight, capacity, operation and design.Optimus Product Catalog No. 1500 E, p. 52 (undated; circa 1939) Optimus dropped the No. 6 in the 1940s and did not produce a similar model until its acquisition of the Svea line in 1969. The Juwel 33 and 34 (made by Gustav Barthel of Dresden which, like Sieverts, was a maker of blowtorches and stoves) is a World War II-era German military field stove of similar size, design and operation to the Svea.G. Rottman, \\"German Field Fortifications 1939-1945,\\" p. 37 (Osprey 2004) The Arara 37, another German-made stove, is similar,A. Sainz, Deutsche Soldaten: The Uniforms, Equipment and Personal Effects of the German Soldier 1939-1945, p. 268 (Casemate 2008) as is the Czech-made Meva Type 2140. More recently manufactured stoves with the same design features as the Svea include the Moldavan-made –ü—Ä–∏–º—É—Å –¢—É—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—Å–∫–∏–π –ü–¢-2 \\"–û–≥–æ–Ω—ë–∫\\" (Primus Tourist PT-2 \\"Little Flame\\"), the German-made Enders \\"Biwak\\" (\\"Bivouac\\") No. 2650, and the Juwel 84, which is essentially a larger and more recent version of the World War II- era Juwel 34. The Lion G102 stove, manufactured by the Jaeil Metal Co., Ltd. of South Korea during the 1990s, is nearly identical to the Svea, but with curved brass pot supports attached to the top of the windscreen instead of the straight metal supports used on the Svea. Pak-Cook stove The Swedish-made Primus 71 and the similar Optimus 80 have a larger fuel tank and are slightly taller and heavier than the Svea. (After Optimus acquired the rights to the Primus name for liquid-fueled stoves in 1962, the Primus 71 and Optimus 80 were identical,C. Fletcher, The New Complete Walker: The Joys and Techniques of Hiking and Backpacking, p. 157 (Knopf 1974) except for the name and markings.E. Drew, The Complete Light-pack Camping and Trail-foods Cookbook, p. 164 (McGraw-Hill 1977)) However, instead of the integrated windscreen on the Svea, the Primus 71 and Optimus 80 stoves fit inside a sheet-metal case for transport that when opened serves as the stove's windscreen and pot support. The type of fuel used and the method of operation of the Primus 71 is the same as the Svea.Primus Product Catalog, p. 32 (undated, circa 1955) The Primus 70 is similar, but with a cylindrical aluminum container instead of a sheet-metal box. The Radius 42, another Swedish-made stove, dates from the 1920s and is slightly smaller than the Primus 71, but is otherwise the same general design.Katalog No. 30, Aktiebolaget Radius (Radius Product Catalog), p. 37 (Feb. 1932) Taiwanese-made knock-offs of the Svea 123 include the Fire-Lite and Trav-ler 77, and the Pak-Cook 235 marketed in the United States under the Stansport and Texsport names.

The bus can be a stock commercial bus with retro-fitted vehicle armour as well as bulletproof glass, or a specially built military armoured vehicle. Lighter armoured buses are also used for prisoner transport. History During World War I, civilian buses were pressed into service, especially by Great Britain and France, fulfilling several roles: to transport troops, supplies, and livestock, and as ambulances and mobile surgeries.C. Ellis & D. Bishop, Military Transport of World War I, Blandford Press, 1970. . pp 132, 133, 134, 138. Britain used several hundred Daimler and LGOC B-type buses as troop transports, but they were not armoured. It was found that the windows were frequently broken by troops' equipment, and the glass was eventually removed. Wooden planks were fixed over the apertures, offering protection from the weather but not from hostile fire.G.J. Robbins & J.B.

The bus was displayed at the 9th International Defence Industry Fair (IDEF'09). The bus was tested in Germany with bombs and multiple calibres of ammunition. Armoured buses weigh considerably more than ordinary buses. As a result, they use more fuel, are prone to mechanical breakdowns, have very high maintenance costs and wear out faster.Interim solution worked out for armored bus shortage Use of armoured buses Israel's Egged bus company says that all its bus lines in the West Bank use bulletproof buses.Interim solution worked out for armored bus shortage Armored buses were considered the safest form of civilian transport on routes to and from the Israeli settlements, although questions have been raised about how effective such buses are.

It aired on October 22, 2007. This episode marks the first appearance of Elle, played by Kristen Bell, credited as a series regular. David Anders (Takezo Kensei) is also credited as a series regular from this episode. Plot As Peter Petrelli settles into his new life with Caitlin, a young woman named Elle ‚Äì soon revealed to possess the ability to conjure electricity ‚Äì searches for him at the Cork docks. Will directs her to the Wandering Rocks Pub. Ricky gets wind of Elle's search and sends Peter to stay at Caitlin's flat, rejecting his offer to deal with Elle on his own. While at Caitlin's, Peter decides to open the box, and finds (among other items) his passport, a plane ticket from New York City to Montreal, and a photo of himself and Nathan (whom he doesn't recognize). While frustrated about the lack of useful information in the box, Peter accidentally taps into his precognitive ability and paints a picture, befuddling Caitlin in the process. The final picture shows Peter and Caitlin outside what looks like to be the Notre-Dame Basilica in Montreal. At the same time, Elle visits the Wandering Rocks Pub and meets Ricky, who lies about seeing Peter. Elle uses her ability to weld the doors closed and electrocutes Ricky, leaving his horrifically charred corpse behind. Later, she receives a phone call from a man she identifies as ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù; for killing Ricky, she is ordered to halt her assignment of finding Peter and return to the Company headquarters. Peter and Caitlin are summoned to the Pub. Caitlin is distraught by her brother's death and is not comforted when Peter confesses that Ricky's killer was there looking for him. The episode ends on his ominous statement, \\"I can't hide anymore. I can't hide.\\" Monica Dawson is questioned by the police concerning the attempted robbery (from \\"The Kindness of Strangers\\"). She refuses to identify the assailant, a local gangbanger, for fear of retribution. Later, she is speaking to Micah Sanders at the Dawson home and unconsciously mimics his piano skills. Micah figures out that she has an ability and confesses his own to her. Using a 9th Wonders! comic book as an example, he theorizes that Monica possesses muscle mimicry, which is the ability to mimic any physical action she sees. Together, the two test her ability's limits; she copies a complicated jump rope routine and martial arts moves from Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story but is interrupted by Dr. Mohinder Suresh. Matt Parkman recruits Nathan Petrelli on his mission to find Maury Parkman, his father, and help Molly. The two find Maury in his apartment in Philadelphia, and discover that he possesses a powerful form of telepathy. Maury has also received the same death threat as Kaito Nakamura and Angela Petrelli. Under the pretense of getting something for Matt, Maury traps him, and Nathan who follows them, in mental illusions while he escapes. In Matt's illusion, he is trapped in a prison cell where a vision of his ex-wife, Janice, appears holding a baby and claiming that Matt walked out on her and her son, threatening he'll eventually do the same to Molly. He is assaulted by a prison guard when he tries to leave the cell after Janice. Nathan's illusion places him on the roof of the Deveaux Building in a post-bomb New York, where he meets and fights a horribly burned vision of himself. As it turns out, Nathan and Matt, are actually fighting each other. Matt is able to project his own thoughts into Nathan's mind and they are able to snap out of the vision before serious injury. In a quick search of Maury's apartment, Matt finds another of the death threats, this one for Bob. While Matt is gone, Mohinder considers taking Molly to the Company for their help. He calls Noah Bennet (who is with the Haitian in Red Square, Moscow, Russia), who advises him to leave the Company out of their affairs, but Mohinder is more concerned with Molly's safety and takes her to Bob and the Company doctors. As Bob assigns Mohinder to retrieve a girl with abilities, Niki Sanders manages to break through the Company's internal security and attack Bob, but Mohinder disables her with an air taser. Once Niki is restrained, Mohinder tries to help her escape the Company hospital, but Niki insists that she is sick and must stay. At the end of the episode, Mohinder goes on his assignment; he meets Monica Dawson at her house and offers her answers to her questions. Ando Masahashi continues to read through Hiro Nakamura's messages from feudal Japan, with the aid of experts in the period working for Yamagato Industries. The scrolls describe how Hiro has been assisting Takezo Kensei and Yaeko to track down maps leading to Whitebeard's camp. According to Hiro, history is falling back into place, including the romance between Kensei and Yaeko. At the end of their story, Hiro, Kensei and Yaeko climb a ridge outside the camp and find Whitebeard's army. The story told by Hiro's scrolls ends when the final written characters can't be deciphered. Ando is left wondering how Hiro's journey concluded.

Claire tries out for the cheerleading team, where she is off-handedly dismissed by Debbie, despite being the best candidate. West convinces Claire to humiliate Debbie so that she can use cheerleading as a cover for their relationship. Debbie is drinking with the other cheerleaders as Claire comes and asks to speak with her in private. After Debbie's second refusal to let Claire join the squad, West appears in a ski mask and picks up Claire, dropping her and ostensibly killing her. Debbie runs as West gives chase. The police come to Costa Verde High School, where a frantic Debbie tells them that a masked flying man chased her and killed Claire. Claire appears, having regenerated, and tells them that she doesn't know what Debbie is talking about. The police find Debbie's alcohol and arrest her. Claire and West sneak away to talk, and another cheerleader tells Claire that she is now in the squad since Debbie has been suspended from school for drinking on campus. Mohinder is testing Monica's ability by way of gymnast tapes. Bob appears and tells Mohinder to give her an experimental variation of the virus, one which should disable her powers. Mohinder refuses, since the virus can mutate and become resistant or infect the general population. Mohinder then calls Bennet, who advises him to do it in the interest of their plan to take down the Company and citing the fact that they have Molly. Mohinder speaks with Monica again, but when confronted with the actual deed, Mohinder instead destroys the syringe. Bob tells him that someone else will do it if he will not, so Mohinder destroys the cabinet filled with their samples of the virus. Bob later thanks Mohinder, telling them that they need him for his morality as well as his blood and knowledge, \\"to keep [them] in line.\\" Bob tells Mohinder that he will be getting a partner to make sure \\"there are no further misunderstandings.\\" Mohinder is checking up on Molly as Niki reveals that she is now his new partner, and that she owes the Company a great deal. Bob also speaks with Monica, encouraging her to use her powers in a positive manner while she remains in New Orleans. He gives her an iPod with videos of various skills for her to learn. Maya and Alejandro are traveling with Sylar to the border. Alejandro wants to leave Sylar and use a coyote to help them cross, believing him to be untrustworthy. Maya argues that they need Sylar and that he has been sent by God. They cross the border where they are stopped by citizen border control. Sylar encourages Maya to use her power to get past, stopping Alejandro from negating her power. The three drive away as the assailants fall. Alejandro later gives Maya an ultimatum: either Sylar goes or he does. She convinces Alejandro to allow Sylar to stay, but he tells her that the next time her power activates, he will let Sylar die. When Maya isn't watching, Sylar tells Alejandro that he intends to kill them and steal their powers, or at least to use Maya, citing his original power as a means to control her. Alejandro, who doesn't speak English, can't understand his threats. Bennet and the Haitian are in Odessa, Ukraine where they find Ivan, an old mentor of Noah and Claude. They threaten to take away memories of his family unless he tells them where to find the other paintings from the series of eight. Ivan refuses, and they begin by taking away his memories of the day he met his wife. Ivan finally crumbles when threatened with the memories of his dead daughter. Ivan mentions that the paintings are \\"where we tagged the liquid man\\". Noah then shoots him, to cover up the interrogation as a simple robbery. They find the paintings. Four of them depict Claire unconscious on the stairs, a hand holding a vial (similar to the injection), Niki beating on a door, and a shocked Peter standing in front of a window, a frowning man behind him in the lower-right corner, and a biohazard symbol overlaid on the lower-left corner.

They rescue Yaeko's father, who tells them that Whitebeard has guns, which he plans to use to overthrow the emperor. They are making their escape when Hiro teleports himself and Yaeko away to escape gunfire. She realizes that he was the one who saved her from the brigands and they kiss.

As president of the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Sellers proposed the adoption of a system of screw threads which was easier for ordinary mechanics and machinists to cut than a similar design by Joseph Whitworth. For many years, he led the machine tool firm of William Sellers & Co., which was a very influential machine tool builder during the latter half of the 19th century. Family Sellers was born in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania to John and Elizabeth (Poole) Sellers, into a Quaker family full of industrial and manufacturing innovators. His cousins include George Escol Sellers (1808‚Äì1899), an inventor holding patents for a hill-climbing locomotive, a pulp-paper process, converting steamboats to coal, and removing brine from salt water, and Coleman Sellers II (1827‚Äì1907), a five-term president of the Franklin Institute, who was instrumental in harnessing Niagara Falls for electricity. Sellers was married in 1849 to Mary Ferris (1820‚Äì1870), with whom he had three children, Katherine (1852‚Äì1917), William (1856‚Äì1933), and Frances (1858‚Äì1859). He married again in 1873 to Am√©lie Haaszm (1842‚Äì1929), with whom he had another three children, Alexander (1875‚Äì1957), Richard (1881‚Äì1942), and Christine (1882‚Äì-1884). He died in his hometown on January 24, 1905 at the age of 81. Career William Sellers & Co. Pennsylvania Avenue, Hamilton, 16th and 17th Streets After receiving a private education in a family-run school, he began apprenticing at age fourteen with his uncle, J. Morton Poole, in a machine shop near Wilmington, Delaware. After seven years, he moved to Providence, Rhode Island to run the shops of what eventually became the Corliss Steam Engine Company. Returning to West Philadelphia to start his own machine company, he eventually formed a partnership with his brother-in-law Edward Bancroft (1811‚Äì1855) in 1848. After Bancroft's death in 1855, Sellers incorporated as William Sellers & Co., which continued to operate until 1947 when it was sold to the Consolidated Machine Tool Corporation and relocated to Rochester, New York. In 1847 Sellers was elected a member of the Franklin Institute, where he served as a member of the Board of Managers from 1857 to 1861 and again from 1864 to 1892, and as president from 1864 to 1867. At a meeting on September 15, 1864, he presented a uniform system of screw threads which with its angle and its flat top and bottom differed from Whitworth's British standard. Within a few years, the system had been adopted by the government workshops, leading railroad companies, prominent machine tool builders and others, under the various names of the United States, Sellers, or Franklin Institute Systems.

Firer's Examination Scheme In 2003 the British Pyrotechnists Association introduced a Firer‚Äôs training scheme for its members, to help set a common standard of safety and knowledge throughout the professional display industry. The scheme requires candidates to undertake a course of training in accordance with a detailed syllabus, after which they sit an exam. Successful candidates are then issued with a BPA Firer‚Äôs identification card to show that they have undertaken the training course and passed the exam. The Association maintains a register of firers on its website that can be checked by anyone wanting to verify the authenticity of BPA Firer‚Äôs identification. Although there is no statutory requirement in the United Kingdom for professional display operators to be licensed or to have received any training, many local authorities and organisations will only allow companies and individuals to work for them who have achieved the BPA qualification. There are two levels of achievement in the scheme. Level 1 is for all personnel involved in setting up and firing professional firework displays, and the higher Level 2 is for professional firework displays managers and supervisors. The scheme is based on a sound knowledge of the hazards associated with: * Firework types * Firework effects * Fireworks in transport * Rigging techniques * Site design * Firing methods * Fallout considerations * Disposal In addition to the training and examination, each candidate is required to maintain a log book of their firework display experience. The log book can be used to verify that display personnel have the necessary practical experience, in a variety of display environments, to complement their formal training.

He played hurling with his local club De La Salle and with the Waterford senior inter-county team from 1954 until 1964. Playing career =Club= Barron played his club hurling with his local De La Salle club. He never won a senior county title. =Inter- county= Barron first came to prominence on the inter-county scene in the late 1950s as a member of the Waterford senior hurling team. At this time, however, Tipperary and Cork were the kingpins of Munster hurling, with all the other counties only providing a supporting role. All this changed in 1957 when Barron won his first Munster title following a victory over reigning champions Cork. Waterford later played Kilkenny in the All-Ireland final, however, victory went to the men from Leinster on that occasion. Waterford were leading by six points with fifteen minutes left, however, the game ended 4‚Äì10 to 3‚Äì12. Two years later in 1959 Barron won a second provincial title. Once again Waterford lined out in the championship decider and once again Kilkenny provided the opposition. The game ended in a draw, however, when the two sides met for the replay the men from Waterford made no mistake in defeating their near rivals and Barron collected an All-Ireland medal. In 1963 he added a National Hurling League medal to his collection before winning a third Munster title. For the third successive time Kilkenny were Waterford's opponents in the All-Ireland final, however, the men from the D√©ise came back from an 11-point deficit but were still beaten by 'the Cats'. Barron retired from inter-county hurling in 1964. =Inter-provincial= Barron also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition. He captured four successive Railway Cup medals in 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1961. Post-playing career John Barron died on 28 April 2008 aged 74.

Later on, a reworked version of the test introduced on October 14, 2010 brought the national failure rate down to around 20%, but the rate was still significantly higher than that of the old test. After passing When the applicant meets the standard of 15 correct answers and the citizenship judge deems that the applicant meets all requirements for citizenship, the applicant is either invited to attend a citizenship ceremony within six months, or receives a residency questionnaire requesting further evidence of living in Canada. If the English or French language requirement is in doubt for the applicant then a hearing with a Citizenship judge is scheduled.

After failing An applicant who fails to meet the standard is scheduled to retake the multiple- choice written test. If they fail again, they must have a 15 to 20 minute interview with a citizenship judge. The judge asks the applicant 20 questions that may be multiple choice, true or false, or question and answer. The judge assesses whether the applicant has correctly answered 15 questions and demonstrated the necessary knowledge to be granted citizenship.

Licensed to Tarboro, North Carolina, United States, it serves the Tarboro and Rocky Mount area. The station is currently licensed to Trey and Associates, LLC. WCPS broadcasts only during the daytime, to avoid conflicting with WJR from Detroit, an AM clear channel station that broadcasts on the same frequency. History In 1946, Tarboro Broadcasting Company applied for station WTNC in Tarboro on 760 kHz. However, the FCC pulled back the application due to transmitter issues and WCPS was finally licensed on October 30, 1947 to Coastal Plains Broadcasting Company, Inc. In 1951, WCSP signed an affiliation agreement with the World Broadcasting System, which distributed music to radio stations on phonograph records. In 1968, WJR in Detroit complained that WCSP was interfering with its clear channel signal. Making this politically sensitive was that a sitting Congressman L.H. Fountain was a co-owner of the station. At the time, concerns were being raised if the FCC could properly regulate the media properties of then-President Lyndon Johnson. In July 1971 the FCC was informed of a change of control of the Corporation removing R. M. \\"Runt\\" Fountain, Sr. In 1974, ownership of 50% of the corporation transferred to Robert L. Harper, the station's general manager. On July 4, 1975, the station (along with the FM station) burned to the ground. In 1985, then President and CEO Robert Harper received the Earl Gluck distinguished service award from the North Carolina association of broadcasters. In addition to his work at the radio station, he served as president of the local chamber of commerce, president of the local Little league, president of the United fund, president of the local People's Bank branch, and president of the local country club. FCC records in 1987-1988 were on paper. They show a transfer to Great American East, Inc in 1987 and another transfer to Coastal Plains Media, Inc. in 1988. The transfer in 1987 coincided with the retirement of Mr Harper. In 1988, transfer was made to a similarly named Coastal Plains Media, Inc. By 1999, when ownership reporting was computerized at the FCC, Coastal Plains Media was owned by Donald and Barbara Curtis. Mr. Curtis continues to very active in radio ownership is Eastern North Carolina through Curtis Media Group. From April 2000 until 2019, the station was owned by Jimmy \\"JJ\\" Johnson as Johnson Broadcast Ventures, LTD. In June 2019, the FCC consented to the sale of the station for $250,000 to Reverend Thomas L.

Based in Wilmington and operated by Friends of Public Radio, Inc. (a community group). It airs NPR, American Public Media, Public Radio International, and BBC programming as well as classical, jazz and adult album alternative music. WHQR hosts concerts and events in their gallery space as well as live-on-the air music with the original Soup to Nuts Live program. The station operates two FM repeater stations, W255BZ from Myrtle Beach on 98.9, W231AB from Lumberton on 94.1. WHQR also operates a sister classical music station called Classical HQR, broadcasting on the HD-2 stream as well as on translator W224CX from Wilmington on 92.7, and on W272CV from Myrtle Beach on 102.3. HD programming WHQR broadcasts in the HD radio format. Since April 2009, WHQR has broadcast Classical HQR on their HD2 sidechannel. Classical HQR specializes in classical music programming with local and national hosts. Translators The network consists of one class C radio station, 91.3 and 5 FM translators. All stations are referred to as either WHQR or Classical HQR. The call letters of the other stations are identified only during required station IDs at the start of each hour. WHQR's 100,000-watt signal not only covers Wilmington but much of southeastern North Carolina including Jacksonville, Surf City, Oak Island, Whiteville, Elizabethtown, Wallace, Warsaw and Lumberton. The translators expand that signal to cover northeastern South Carolina, including Myrtle Beach, Conway, Dillion, and Marion Counties. WHQR still owns the 96.7 translator in Brunswick county, which was used for the Classical HQR format from September 2014 to March 2016. The signal changed to 92.7 MHz, which increased the power from 98 to 250 watts. The current station manager, Michelle Rhinesmith, hopes that WHQR will be able to use the 96.7 translator to increase the range of the classical station to more of Brunswick county and Kure Beach. Programming In addition to syndicated national programming, WHQR has local programs that are both talk and music shows. WHQR hosts local news on the 91.3 station with the call-in show Coastline hosted by Rachel Lewis Hilburn, which features problems affecting southeastern North Carolina. There is also a short interview segment called Communique that airs several times a day about local movers and shakers. WHQR also features several folk, jazz and adult album alternative local programming. The MC Erny Art Gallery space at the WHQR studios in the historic Warwick building in downtown Wilmington also hosts community events. There are six art shows per year and the gallery participates in Wilmington's Fourth Friday late night gallery event. There are eight Soup to Nuts Live concerts per year, which are then aired on the radio on the Saturday program. In collaboration with StarNews Media, the MC Erny Gallery also holds the monthly book club, Prologue, which in February 2018 moved from 7p.m. to noon. A Little Lunch Music is an informal concert hosted in the gallery on the first Friday of every month at noon. History WHQR began with a dark day for classical music lovers in Wilmington. On a Saturday in March 1979, avid listeners were disappointed when the local commercial radio station dropped the Opera broadcast without warning. Several listeners gathered together to figure out a way to bring opera broadcasts back, and held their first meeting on April 19 in the Kenan Hall Band Room on the UNC-Wilmington campus. They organized into a group called Friends of the Opera. They looked into the possibility of improving and collaborating with the UNCW student radio station, WLOZ, but there were many financial and administrative hurdles that made that a difficult possibility. Friends of the Opera slowly realized that Public Radio was the best way to bring classical music to Wilmington and changed their name to Friends of Public Radio in early 1980. With some financial and fundraising help from Friends of Public Radio, WLOZ hosted the Metropolitan Opera broadcasts while they were on air during the school year from December 12, 1979 until they went off the air in February 1981 due to a possible drug scandal. In early 1982, Friends of Public Radio applied to the FCC to secure the license for 91.3 MHz. They were turned down and told to apply next year. Friends of Public Radio continued to fundraise with concerts and newsletters and received local city and county grants. They were able to hire a technical director and a station manager. In July 1983, just as the station was about to start construction of their tower, WECT filed a complaint with the FCC that the radio station at the low end of the FM frequency station would conflict with their Channel 6 TV broadcast. In order to go on the air on their projected date of April 1984, the station was forced to drop the signal strength from a planned 30,000 watts to 1,500 watts with a plan with the FCC to slowly increase the power as long as there was no interference. The station was up to 10,000 watts by 1985. Friends of Public Radio signed a 10-year lease for studio space in 1984 and volunteers helped with construction and fundraising. The station hired 3 more staff members as required by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Membership for the radio station passed 1,000 in March 1984, and they choose the WHQR call sign. Renamed WHQR, the first NPR affiliate for southeastern North Carolina, the station went on-air at 7a.m. on Sunday, April 22, 1984. The first sound on the new radio station was of a baby crying, then Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D minor, followed by then station manager Michael Titterton announcing; > Good morning and welcome to the very first broadcast day of WHQR-FM, > Wilmington North Carolina. WHQR FM transmits on a frequency of 91.3 MHz at > an Effective radiated power of 1500 watts from 1270 feet above sea level. > WHQR FM is licensed to and operated by the Friends of Public Radio, Inc with > studios and offices at 1026 Greenfield Street. Transmitter and antenna are > located at Winnabow, North Carolina. The offices at Greenfield Street were in a converted bar in a strip mall. The first classical programming was a needle-drop style hosted by Michael Titterton, Prelude and Concert in the Morning, and the station provided local news at the top of the hour in the mornings. NPR talk shows played in the afternoons and in the evenings local volunteer DJs hosted the show Jazz till Midnight. In keeping with the founding of the station, Metropolitan and other Opera companies played on Saturday afternoons. The station was on air for 18 hours a day for the first several years. After less than 5 months of being on the air, on September 13, 1984 Hurricane Diana hit the Carolina coast. Most communication in the area was down, but WHQR was only off air for 90 minutes and was, for a while, the only FM station on-air. In May 1985, Sharon Mahoney won two Associated Press awards for journalism - one of them was for her reporting during Diana. Over the first five years, the station slowly increased and hit all of their semi-annual pledge-drive goals save for one where there was a problem with signal strength. The Radio Research Corporation's (RRC) effectiveness rating in July 1985 showed that WHQR was 31st of 312 public radio stations nationally and in 1988 \\"Titterton announced in the program guide that the station had been in the top 20 of RRC-rated stations for the past 3 years.\\" In 1992, the popular weekly program Flamenco Cafe with William \\"Paco\\" Strickland started. Station manager Titterton heard him at a bar and recruited him to play Flamenco guitar on air. Flamenco cafe was syndicated to public radio stations nationwide. In April 1994 the WHQR studios moved to a new downtown location on the third floor of the historic Warwick building at 254 N. Front Street, Wilmington. WHQR suffered serious financial problems during the recession, and \\"ran a deficit of nearly $400,000 in 2007-2008.\\" In January 2007, the station cancelled several local jazz and folk programs. This included Flamenco Cafe, which moved to The Penguin, a local commercial station. Programming manager Bob Workman and station manager John Milligan stated that they were trying to appeal to a younger audience and create smoother \\"talk blocks\\". The next year, listeners complained in an editorial in the Wilmington Star News that there was too much talk on the station and not enough classical music. In December 2008, Friends of Public Radio decided to remove the position of station manager as a cost-cutting measure. WHQR purchased an HD transmitter in April 2009 after a successful pledge drive, which fixed the older, unreliable transmitter. The station's financial problems improved slowly, from 2008 to 2009 WHQR ran a $170,000 deficit and almost broke even in 2010. In September 2010 WHQR hired Cleve Callison as station manager, who pushed for most of the financial changes at the station. On June 1, 2009, WHQR added the HD2 station, Classical HQR, which simulcast the morning local classical music and added NPR classical stream. Listenership was low as people had to buy new HD radio receivers to tune in. The station also had an extra pledge drive in the summer of 2009 to help pay off their debts. Local actress Mary Carole Erny died in 2010. She spent 15 years volunteering for WHQR. In her will she bequeathed the station $50,000, which WHQR learned about in 2011. The station spent some of the money for an assessment team to see if WHQR would get a positive response from a capital campaign. The station renamed the art gallery space in the Warwick building to be the MC Erny Gallery in her honor. In early 2013 the emPowering Our Future campaign started with a plan to raise $1.5 million to expand service, improve technology and create a welcoming space. In 2014 WHQR divided into two stations. Even though the classical station already existed on the HD2 channel, Friends of Public Radio purchased a transmitter on the analog FM frequency of 96.7 MHz and Classical HQR was on the airwaves with classical music and opera. The morning classical music was removed from 91.3, which became a news, talk and jazz station. In August 2014, with money raised from the capital campaign, Friends of Public Radio bought the studios in the Warwick building outright. Classic HQR moved to the FM frequency 92.7 MHz in March 2016 with a higher broadcast power of 250 watts. The campaign slogan \\"92 is the new 96\\" played for a month during the transition. On April 23, 2016, the birthday of Shakespeare and the day after the station's 32nd anniversary, WHQR added W272CV 102.3 FM in Myrtle Beach for the classical format. In December 2016 the emPowering Our Future Capital Campaign reached its $1.5 million goal after a public drive. Most of the campaign operated in a quiet phase, receiving $1.15 million in grants and support from underwriting businesses. The money from the capital campaign is going towards one-time improvements to the station. In January 2017 the goal was exceeded with a final amount of $1.9 million raised. Michelle Rhinesmith replaced station manager Cleve Callison in August 2017.

Salcedo spent thirteen seasons in the American Soccer League, leading the league in scoring three of those seasons, one season in the St. Louis Soccer League and part of one season in the National Soccer League of Chicago. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Early career Salcedo was born in Spain and played with several youth teams before moving to the United States in May 1929. He played with a string of amateur clubs playing in city leagues, including Segura F.C. (Metropolitan League of New York City), Madrid F.C. and Portuguese Victoria F.C. (Westchester County League). When Portuguese Victoria won the 1934 league title, Salcedo came to the attention of Duncan Othen, coach of the American Soccer League club Brooklyn Hispano. Brooklyn Hispano In 1934, Salcedo signed with Hispano and would play most of his career with the Brooklyn team, beginning as a center forward before moving to right forward. While with Hispano, Salcedo would play with Walter Bahr, another great American player. In his first season, Salcedo scored eleven goals, putting him sixth on the league‚Äôs scoring list. This led to his selection to the U.S. national team for an unofficial game with Scotland on May 19, 1935. In 1937, Hispano went to the ASL title game, only to fall to the Kearny Scots. Chicago On September 9, 1938, Chicago Manhattan Beer purchased Salcedo‚Äôs contract for $500. In Chicago, he joined Billy Gonsalves, a future Hall of Famer. In the 1938-1939 season, Manhattan Beer played in the St. Louis Soccer League which had invited several Chicago teams to join the league. Manhattan finished second in the league standings. The team also went to the National Challenge Cup final before falling to Brooklyn St. Mary's Celtic. In September 1939, Salcedo signed with the Kearny Scots (ASL). He played one game, against Hispano. However, Hispano disputed Salcedo‚Äôs signing with the Scots, claiming they still owned his rights in the ASL. The US Football Association agreed with Hispano and nullified Salcedo‚Äôs contract with the Scots. Salcedo returned to Manhattan Beer for the start of the 1939-1940 St. Louis Soccer League season. However, he then jumped to the Danish- Americans of the National Soccer League of Chicago. He played only briefly with the Danish-Americans before moving back east to sign with Hispano. Brooklyn Hispano Beginning in 1939, Salcedo would play the next eight seasons with Hispano. While Salcedo is best known for his goal scoring exploits, he did play part of one game in the fall of 1941 in goal. That season, he dropped to ninth in the end of year goals list after missing part of the season with a leg injury. Hispano won its only league title in 1942-1943. It also took the National Challenge Cup giving Salcedo and his team mates a ‚Äúdouble‚Äù. Hispano repeated as National Cup champions the next year. At the start of the 1947-1948 season, Hispano released Salcedo and he signed with the Philadelphia Americans. That season, Salcedo won his last championship as the Americans took the ASL title. Non-soccer career The low salaries paid by soccer teams during this era was not enough to live on. Consequently, Salcedo and his team mates had non-playing jobs in addition to their soccer careers. Salcedo worked a variety of manual labor jobs. When he moved to Chicago Manhattan Beer in 1938, he worked in the Manhattan Beer brewery. After returning to Brooklyn in 1939, he was hired by Federal Shipyard and Drydock where he became a machinist in 1940. In 1946, he left Federal to join the Engineering & Research Division of the ITT Continental Baking Company. He retired in 1979. He was married with two children, a daughter, Diane, and a son, Hank who married Eileen Mandeville of Oradell NJ.

Moore Academy) was a magnet high school in the Waco ISD district in Waco, TX. A.J. Moore was designed to prepare students for success in post secondary education and in the workplace. Students were prepared to excel academically, physically and socially. Special emphasis was placed on business, engineering, entrepreneurship, technology, and post-secondary education. In February 2012, the Waco Independent School District decided in part, avoiding a $3.4 million budget shortfall, to close and consolidate A. J. Moore Academy with University High School. On June 2, 2012, A.J. Moore Academy gave diplomas to its last graduating class. A. J. Moore Academy existed as a stand-alone school for 14 years. Curriculum A.J. Moore Academy was chosen by the National Academy Foundation (NAF) to be one of the twelve pilot sites in the US for the Academy of Information Technology and one of thirteen pilot sites for the Academy of Engineering. The school was the first school in the nation to include all four NAF academies including an Academy of Hospitality and Tourism and an Academy of Finance. The Academy of Engineering is affiliated with Project Lead the Way (PLTW) since 2001. It was the sixth school in the State of Texas to become certified to offer PLTW courses for college credit. In 2007 the school became a pilot school for a new partnership between PLTW, NAF, and the National Action Council for Minorities in Engineering. The school focused heavily on career choices and college preparation with guidance from school counselors, GEAR-UP professionals, and Princeton Review instructors. Students must obtain permission from the counselor or school principal to participate at local colleges and universities. Students took challenging course work, appropriate co-curricular activities and received guidance and counseling to help them enter the college of their choice. Many Advanced Placement (AP) courses were offered at A.J. Moore Academy while an unusual amount of Dual Credit Courses (high school/college credit classes) are offered for a public high school. The Dual Credit Courses offered credit from the University of Texas at Arlington, McLennan Community College, Rochester Institute of Technology and Texas State Technical College. History The school was named after Professor A.J. Moore, the first principal and first African-American principal of an all (later segregated) black school that existed in Waco in the years following the American Civil War. A.J. Moore Academy was on a campus built for the school that was known as Jefferson-Moore High School (500 North University Parks Drive, Waco, Texas 76702). The school was almost completely remodeled during the 2009-2010 school year. In 1986, three Waco High Schools (Jefferson Moore High School, Waco High School, and Richfield High School) were consolidated. The building that housed the defunct Jefferson-Moore High School was renamed the Waco 9th Grade Center in 1988. A.J. Moore Academy was chartered in 1997 and it became the only magnet high school in the Waco Independent School District. In 1997 the school began with only a ninth grade. Each year after that, the school added the next grade level to curriculum. In 2001, A.J. Moore Academy gave diplomas to its first graduating class. Under the leadership of Dr. Debra Bishop, the school led the district into new education ideas such as job-specific academies, a business advisory board, and extensive college preparation. In 2010, Dr. Debra Bishop retired and Mrs. Angela Reiher became principal. Mrs. Reiher continued advancing the school culture and innovations that she helped create as Director of Academies and Assistant Principal during Dr. Bishop's era. Enrollment Because it was a magnet school, any Waco Independent School District student could attend A.J. Moore Academy regardless of city limits or school boundary lines. An application was required but selection was made on a first-come basis. If more students applied than the school had space, a lottery was held to fill remaining slots.

Background Bacon was born at St Bees near Whitehaven in Cumberland, the youngest son of William Bacon, a ship's captain trading in coal from that port to Ireland. His eldest full brother was Thomas and his father also had a son William from his first marriage. The family claimed descent from Sir Nicholas Bacon (1540‚Äì1624); however, since very little is known about his ancestry and upbringing, the connection may be spurious or illegitimate. Early life Following the death of both his parents, William Bacon and Elizabeth Richardson, Anthony moved to Talbot County Maryland to live with his maternal uncles, tobacco merchants Thomas and Anthony Richardson. He became a merchant and mariner, expanding the business to include Virginia and the import of Spanish wine. During the Seven Years' War Bacon became a government contractor for shipping and victualling in partnership with London merchant William Biggin, also from Whitehaven. Career In 1738, Bacon became master of the ship York, a tobacco trade vessel owned by John Hanbury. In 1740, under contract from Andrew Reid esq. and in accordance with the Transportation Act 1717, Bacon used this ship to transport 115 convicted felons (women, men and children) from Newgate Prison in London to the Province of Maryland where they were sold for a 7 to 14-year penal transportation sentence. Between 1760 and 1766, Anthony Bacon was full or partial owner of five ships that completed a total of six Atlantic slave trade voyages: the ship Sarah in 1760 to Virginia; the ship Kepple in 1760 to South Carolina; the ship Charming Molly 1762 to Maryland; the ship Two Sisters in 1763 to Maryland; and the ship King of Bonny in 1765 to Barbados & in 1766 to St. Kitts. In 1763, the ship Two Sisters was co-owned by Anthony Bacon and his nephew, Anthony Richardson Jr. The following year, 1764, Bacon withdrew from the tobacco trade, and concentrated on trade to and contracting in new British colonies (the ceded islands‚ÄîSt Vincent, Tobago, Dominica, and Grenada) in the West Indies and west Africa. At the same time to aid his business in government contracts, he was elected as Member of Parliament for the venal borough of Aylesbury, which he represented until 1784, by which time the participation of MPs in government contracting had been prohibited.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1765 Bacon went into partnership with William Brownrigg of Whitehaven, taking out a lease on of land in the Merthyr valley.L. Ince, The South Wales Iron Industry, 1750‚Äì1885 (1993), 60. After obtaining the mineral-rich land very cheaply, they employed Charles Wood to build Cyfarthfa forge using his patented potting and stamping process to make pig iron into bar iron.J. Gross (ed.), The Diary of Charles Wood of Cyfarthfa Ironworks, Merthy Tydfil, 1766‚Äì1767 (Merton Priory Press, Cardiff, 2001). This was followed by a blast furnace at Cyfarthfa, 50 feet high and opened in 1767. In 1766, Bacon took over the Plymouth Ironworks to supply pig iron to his forge. Brownrigg partnership was dissolved in 1777.Ince, 60. Bacon leased the Hirwaun ironworks in 1780.Ince, 33. Bacon's government contracts included supplying ordnance. In 1773, after the Carron Company's guns had been withdrawn from service as dangerous, Bacon offered to provide three cannon for a trial, made respectively with charcoal, coke, and mixed fuel. He also delivered a fourth with then 'cast solid and bored'. This gun was reported to be 'infinitely better than [those cast] in the ordinary way, because it makes the ordnance more compact and consequently more durable', despite the greater expense. This led to a contract in 1774.D. Braid, 'John Wilkinson's first patent' Wilkinson Studies I (1991), 45‚Äì47; D. Braid, 'John Wilkinson's patent, 1063' Wilkinson Studies II (1992), 33‚Äì4; The National Archives, WO 47/83, 240 (original pagination). These guns were apparently cast by John Wilkinson until Bacon's contract with him ended in 1776. The next year, Bacon asked for Richard Crawshay's name to be included in his warrants, and from this time the cannon were cast at Cyfarthfa. This continued until Bacon as a member of parliament was disabled from undertaking government contracts in 1782, when the forge and some of the gunfoundry business were leased to Francis Homfray.The National Archives, WO 47/80-100, passim. Family Bacon married Elizabeth Richardson,Welsh Biography Online but their only son died in 1770, aged 12. His brother Thomas also died in Maryland, and one of Thomas' daughters (Elizabeth) had sailed to England to assist Anthony's family. Bacon therefore made Elizabeth and his illegitimate sons his heirs. When he died, the sons received princely amounts for the time. Bacon's eldest son, Anthony Bushby Bacon (1772‚Äì1827) was to receive the Cyfarthfa estate when he came of age. The second son Thomas Bacon was to receive the Plymouth furnace, etc. In addition, \\"The Hirwaun furnace and collieries became the joint property of Anthony II and Thomas, while Robert, it seems, had the mines, etc., at Workington. Elizabeth was to receive a clear annuity of ¬£300 when she became 21. William, then a baby, was to receive the remainder of the trust funds, provided the sum did not amount to more than ¬£10,000, when he came of age.\\"Dictionary of Welsh Biography: Anthony Bacon\\". Retrieved 24 February 2008. However, the sons showed little or no interest in their father's businesses and rapidly sold or leased them, Anthony II to Richard Crawshay, who was one of the witnesses to the father's will, and Thomas to his uncle Richard Hill.

He was accused of heresy but was defended by Pope Innocent I and received from Innocent the important decretal of the Liber Regularum.

He mentions that he had been away from Rouen (396), as he had been requested to travel to Britain to help resolve some doctrinal issues. Victricius describes Britain as a wild and hostile place dealing with paganism and heresy in contrast with Italy with its abundance of holy sites and relics of martyrs.

Through a surprise attack, the Roman commander Scipio Africanus managed to destroy a numerous force of Carthaginians and their Numidian allies not far from the outflow of the Medjerda River in modern Tunisia. Thus he gained a decisive strategic advantage, switched the focus of the war from Italy and Iberia to Carthaginian north Africa, and contributed largely to the final Roman victory. Background The invasion of Africa was a part of the initial Roman plans for the conduct of the Second Punic War. The Carthaginian leader Hannibal thwarted them when he set out from his base in Iberia, went through western southern Gaul and crossed the Alps in 218 BC. The consul to whom the expedition to Carthage was entrusted, decided to transfer his army from Sicily to Cisalpine Gaul to defend the north of Italy. This resulted in the battle of Trebia and a series of other heavy defeats of the Romans by Hannibal, which put the idea of an assault on the Carthaginian homeland out of question. During the following years, the war raged primarily in Italy, Iberia and Sicily, but north Africa was largely spared. The situation changed with the growing fortunes of Rome. By 205 BC, the Romans had effectively dealt with two invasions of Italy ‚Äì that of Hannibal, who was gradually worn out and stripped of allies,Mommsen, Theodor, The History of Rome, Book III, Chapter VIDelbr√ºck, Hans, Geschichte der Kriegskunst im Rahmen der politischen Geschichte, I Teil: Das Altertum, Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin 1964, S. 358-361, 386 and that of Hasdrubal, son of Hamilcar Barca, who was defeated outright in the battle of the Metaurus river.Creasy, Edward, The Fifteen Decisive Battles of The World From Marathon to Waterloo, The Project Gutenberg Etext The various Carthaginian forces had been driven off Sicily and Iberia or hemmed in the far south and northwestern corners of the Apennine peninsula. By the fall of Syracuse and the reconquest of the parts of Sicily that had been temporarily lost after the battle of Cannae, the Romans secured a base for a naval assault on Carthage. They made use of that by carrying out a number of raids on African soil in 208, 207Livy, History of Rome, XXVII.9; XVIII.4 and 205 BC.Livy, XXIX.3 Since 206 BC, when Scipio Africanus finally expelled the Carthaginians from Iberia (see the battle of Ilipa), he was preoccupied with the idea that Africa should be the next target. To this end, he concluded an alliance with Syphax ‚Äì one of the most powerful Numidian rulers at the time and an old foe of Carthage ‚Äì even before he got authority from Rome to lead the future invasion.Livy, XXVIII, 17-18; Appian, Roman History, The Punic Wars, Section 2.10; Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. 3, pp. 964-965 Even though Scipio was elected consul for 205 BC, he had to endure hard political wrangling before the Senate approved his intentions. His main opponent was Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the Delayer), who argued that the expedition to Africa was too risky and that the primary objective was to fight Hannibal in Bruttium. Scipio managed to persuade the senators that his plan was the perfect way to force the Carthaginians out of Italy.Livy, XXVIII.40-45Plutarch, The Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans: Fabius Nevertheless, he was not given enough resourcesCassius Dio, Roman History, Book XVII and had to spend a whole year in preparations. The Carthaginians were warned of what was coming when Scipio sent his legate C. Laelius with a naval force to plunder the area of Hippo Regius on the African coast west of Carthage (205 BC). They took various measures to prevent a major Roman invasion. However, the attempt to persuade the Macedonian king Philip to invade Sicily was unsuccessful, and the reinforcements sent to their own commanders in Bruttium and Liguria were not sufficient to revive the war in Italy (see the articles about the battle of Croton and the Po valley raid). Nor was Scipio dissuaded by Syphax's defection, who took the side of Carthage thanks to the diplomatic skills of Hasdrubal Gisgo and the charms of his daughter, Sophonisba.Livy, XXIX, 23-24 Prelude =Invasion of Africa= The invasion of Africa began in 204 BC. Several hundred transport ships carried the Roman army of no more than 35,000 soldiersLivy, XXIX.25Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 115 to Cape Farina (Rusucmona), about 35 km northwest of Carthage.Map.–ö–æ–Ω–Ω–æ–ª–ª–∏, –ü., –ì—Ä–µ—Ü–∏—è –∏ –†–∏–º. –≠–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –≤–æ–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏, ¬´–≠–∫—Å–º–æ-–ü—Ä–µ—Å—Å¬ª, –ú–æ—Å–∫–≤–∞, 2000 Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 120 By his very arrival, Scipio caused much anxiety and fear, and he used the resulting confusion to capture several towns and plunder the countryside.Livy, XXIX, 28-29; Cassius Dio, XVII, 63-64 The main Carthaginian commander who opposed him was Hasdrubal, son of Gisgo. He despatched a significant cavalry force in order to stop the depredation and restrict Scipio‚Äôs manoeuvres, but the Romans destroyed it near the town of Salaeca.Livy, XXIX.34; Cassius Dio XVII, 65-66 Thus the Roman commander received a temporary advantage, which was strengthened when Scipio was joined by Massinissa, a leader of the Massylians.Livy, XXIX.29; Appian, The Punic Wars, 3.14 Hasdrubal was impeded by the wavering of Syphax, who \\"failed... to render them (the Carthaginians) whole-hearted assistance\\" and thus allowed the Romans to ravage the country with impunity.Cassius Dio, XVII, 64, 67-68 =Siege of Utica= Having collected abundant booty and numerous slaves, in the autumn Scipio moved to Utica. His intention was to capture the ancient Phoenician city and make it a base for his further operations.Livy, XXIX.35Cassius Dio, XVII, 68 The direct assault on the walls was repulsed even though it was supported by siege engines and the Roman fleet, so that the Romans had to undertake a regular siege of the city.Appian, The Punic Wars, 3.16; Caven, The Punic Wars, pp. 238-239 The emergence of two large enemy armies effectively ended the siege very soon.Cassius Dio, XVII, 69 These were the forces of Hasdrubal Gisgo and his son-in-law Syphax, who apparently did not hesitate anymore. According to the tradition passed by ancient authors such as Polybius and Livy, the army of Hasdrubal amounted to more than 30,000 and that of Syphax was twice the size,Polybius, The Histories, XIV, 1.14 but these numbers are considered as exaggerated by modern researchers, who estimate a combined Carthaginian-Numidian strength of 33,000‚Äì47,500.According to Scullard (Scipio Africanus, p. 124) Hasdrubal and Syphax could not muster more than 35,000 soldiers. Fournie (TheHistoryNetAncient and Medieval WarsSecond Punic War: Battle of Zama, p. 1 ) is on the same opinion. Caven (Punic Wars, p. 240) suggests that Livy's figure of 93,000 is undoubtedly inflated, but nevertheless the Carthaginians and their Numidian allies had a significant numerical advantage that forced Scipio to retreat. The two armies forced Scipio to retreat to a promontory not far from Utica, which was later called Castra Cornelia. He fortified the narrow neck of land and set his winter quarters, relying on supplies of corn and clothing that were being sent to him from Sicily, Sardinia and Iberia. Hasdrubal and Syphax built their separate camps some distance from Castra Cornelia.Cassius Dio, XVII, 69Scullard, Scipio Africanus, pp. 124-125 =Peace negotiations= Throughout the winter, the Carthaginians continued to build up their forces. They prepared a fleet in order to cut the supply routes and fully blockade the Roman armyPolybius, XIV, 1.1-2, 6.7; Livy, XXX.3 and were waiting for mercenaries from Iberia and Liguria.Appian, The Punic Wars, 3.17 The actual hostilities ceased for a time due to the efforts of Syphax to arbitrate for a reconciliation. Hasdrubal accepted the proposed terms, which stipulated that both Rome and Carthage should recall their armies respectively from Africa and Italy,Cassius Dio, XVII, 72; Polybius, XIV, 2.10 but did not stop the aforementioned military preparations. Peace under such conditions was definitely not the purpose with which Scipio negotiated with Syphax. At first, he used the negotiations as a cover for trying to win over the Numidian to Rome. As these attempts proved to be of no avail, the Roman leader nevertheless continued to send envoys to the Numidian camp. Scipio aimed, firstly, to mislead the enemy that he was insecure and therefore anxious to conclude peace and, secondly, to reconnoitre the position and organization of the enemy. His envoys, who were carefully selected for the latter purpose, informed him that both camps consisted primarily of huts built from wood, reed, and other flammable material.Livy, XXX.3-4; Polybius, XIV, 2.5-14; Frontinus, Stratagems, I, 2.1Scullard, Scipio Africanus, pp. 125-126 Battle =The burning of the camps= On the basis of this information, Scipio elaborated his plan for the battle. He knew that the Carthaginian preparations to attack Castra Cornelia were continuing, and with the first signs of the spring he launched a preemptive strike. The ancient authors provide two versions of what happened. According to Livy and Polybius, Scipio placed a detachment (2,000 strong) on a hill overlooking Utica so as to deceive the enemy‚Äôs scouts that he was preparing to attack the city. Another small detachment was left to guard the Roman camp against possible attack from the city‚Äôs defenders. The main forces marched at night, more than 10 kilometers, and reached the camps of Hasdrubal and Syphax before dawn. Scipio separated the army in two halves and ordered Laelius and Massinissa‚Äôs Numidians to set fire to and destroy Syphax's camp. Laelius and Massinissa left Syphax's warriors almost no chance to escape, as they were caught sleeping and utterly unprepared. The flames that started from the huts outside the palisades spread easily and engulfed the whole camp. All the exits were blockaded by the Romans, and numbers of unarmed soldiers were slaughtered; others were caught by the flames, as well as many pack animals, or were trampled to death at the gates. The same happened with the army of Hasdrubal. Its soldiers were awakened by the news that the neighbouring camp was ignited, and some of them rushed to help the Numidians without arms, thinking that the flames were the result of an accident. Scipio waited for this moment of confusion to attack with his part of the Roman army. The Carthaginians could not offer any organized resistance and were crushed. Only their general (as well as Syphax), with a small body of troops, managed to escape.Livy, XXX.5-6; Polybius, XIV, 4.1-10; XIV, 5.1-3Caven, Punic Wars, p. 241; Scullard, Scipio Africanus, pp. 126-127 =Appian‚Äôs story= The version of Livy and Polybius is supported by other ancient historians, such as FlorusFlorus, Epitome of Roman History, Book I, Section 22 and Frontinus.Frontinus, Stratagems, II, 5.29 In ‚ÄúThe Punic Wars‚Äù, a part of his ‚ÄúRoman History‚Äù, Appian relates another story of the events. According to Appian, Scipio detached only Massinissa and his horsemen to prevent Syphax from rendering help to Hasdrubal.Appian, History of Rome, The Punic Wars, 4.20 With the bulk of his legionaries, the Roman commander suddenly attacked Hasdrubal's camp and slaughtered almost all of his soldiers, because those who initially made their escape were rounded up by the Roman cavalry. When Syphax knew what was happening, he sent a cavalry detachment to assist Hasdrubal, but these horsemen were met and routed by Massinissa. Fearing that Scipio would turn on him after dealing with Hasdrubal‚Äôs army, Syphax abandoned his camp and retreated to safety with his army.Appian, History of Rome, The Punic Wars, 4.21-22 Aftermath =Casualties= The Carthaginians suffered heavy casualties and their field forces were virtually eliminated for some time.Caven, Punic Wars, pp. 241-242 According to Polybius, the combined Carthaginian and Numidian forces lost 91,500 killed or captured, with 2,500 survivors.Polybius, XIV, 6.3 Livy claims 40,000 killed, 5,000 captured and 2,500 survivors, contradicting his claim of 93,000 soldiers, while Appian gives 30,000 dead and 2,400 captured.Appian, The Punic Wars, 4.23Livy, XXX.6Appian, The Punic Wars, 4.23 Almost all sources (except Cassius Dio) agree that the losses of the Romans were minimal. =Analysis= Polybius wrote: \\"...it is not possible to find any other disaster which even if exaggerated could be compared with this, so much did it exceed in horror all previous events. Therefore of all the brilliant exploits performed by Scipio this seems to me the most splendid and most adventurous.\\"Polybius, XIV, 5.14-15 With one single strike Scipio was able to get rid of the Carthaginian blockade and to renew the offensive operations of the previous summer.Barcel√≥, Hannibal, S. 84-85; Scullard, Scipio Africanus, p. 127 What followed shortly afterwards was the battle of the Great Plains, which ended with another crushing defeat of Hasdrubal Gisgo and Syphax.Caven, Punic Wars, pp. 242-243; Scullard, Scipio Africanus, pp. 128-131 Carthage had to recall its armies from Italy for a last decisive encounter that took place in 202 BC, and resulted in a final defeat and a peace treaty, ending the Second Punic War in 201 BC.

He was most famous for being the founder of the West-side O'Donnell Mob aka the Westside O'Donnells or West-side gang (no relation to the South Side O'Donnells, a rival gang). Early years Myles O‚ÄôDonnell was born into a large, struggling Irish Catholic family in the Chicago Western suburb of Cicero, Illinois. Like any other poor child off the streets in the town of Cicero, Myles started his criminal career committing petty crime. William \\"Klondike\\" O‚ÄôDonnell was only a few years younger than his brother. They, along with their youngest brother, Bernard, entered the bootlegging business together. Alliance with Torrio The O‚ÄôDonnell brothers made an alliance with Johnny Torrio, the leader of the Chicago Outfit. When Torrio got into a war with Dean O'Banion and the North Side Gang and when the South Side O‚ÄôDonnells got into a war with Frank McErlane things went better for the O‚ÄôDonnells not having to worry about enemies. Getting away with murder One day after drinking himself to the point where he was staggering, Myles and a childhood friend and Westside O'Donnell member Jim Doherty staggered into a saloon early Sunday morning. The saloon belonged to Eddie Tancl, a man O'Donnell and Capone hated because of his way of buying beer from whomever he wished. Myles and Jim ordered some breakfast from the only waiter still working on the job that day. Sitting across from the two Westsiders were Eddie Tancl and his wife. Sitting across from the couple were Mayme McClain, Tancl's star entertainer, and Leo Klimas, Tancl's head bartender. After Myles and Jim were done eating they complained to the waiter that they had been overcharged on the bill. Tancl made his way to the O'Donnells' table and blocked his way in between the waiter and O'Donnell just before he threw a punch at the waiter. O'Donnell gave Tancl a shove and then both men drew their guns. They shot each other in the chest. Doherty got up from the table and began firing. Klimas and the waiter tried to disarm Doherty. O'Donnell fired a shot at Klimas pushing him back against the bar, where he died. O'Donnell was hit by four shots in the chest while he proceeded to the street with Doherty. Tancl was also hit in the chest in numerous places, and Doherty was hit several times in the leg by Tancl during the gun battle. Tancl and O'Donnell had no bullets left in their guns, but Doherty did. As the two Westsiders made their way to the street, Eddie Tancl grabbed a different gun from behind the bar. Sources say that Myles and Doherty split up and went different directions through the streets. The way Myles ran it was hard for him to get away, because he was in the middle of the street running through Sunday churchgoers while bleeding heavily. Tancl chased after O'Donnell through the streets, shooting at him until his gun was empty. Out of breath, Tancl threw his empty handgun at the back of O'Donnell's head. O'Donnell fell and passed out due to exhaustion; Tancl fell as well but didn't pass out. As Tancl and O'Donnell lay just a few feet from each other in the middle of the street, the waiter O'Donnell had tried to hit ran towards O'Donnell and Tancl. Tancl shouted to the waiter, \\"He got me, get him.\\" Those were his last words. The waiter jumped on O'Donnell's body a few times, kicked him in the face, and fled the crime scene. Doherty managed to limp his way to a nearby hospital to treat the gunshot wounds to his leg. Myles was later picked up by cops in the place where he had passed out. Other sources state different events in which Myles fled the saloon first and Klimas was never hit because he hid during the gun battle. Tancl shot Doherty, and Doherty fell and never returned fire or got up after that. Myles ran outside the saloon and through the streets. Tancl chased after him and essentially followed the same series of events in the first story. Klimas ran after his boss to aid him. Tancl said to Klimas, \\"Leo, kill the rat, he got me,\\" and Klimas did what the waiter is reported to have done in the first story. Doherty got up and stumbled into the streets, where he saw Klimas beating O'Donnell up. Doherty stumbled behind Klimas and shot him in the head at point blank range, killing him instantly. Doherty picked up O'Donnell, put him in his car and they both drove away. O'Donnell and Doherty were both arrested when injured from gunfire. Both of the Irish gangsters were put on trial after they had recovered. The prosecutor handling the case of the double homicide failed to convince the judge to convict both gangsters. It is said both gangsters left the courtroom after being released with a group of family and friends happy to see them released. Sources say the gangsters left with a group of good-looking women. Myles and Doherty were never arrested for the murders, although there were many witnesses. It was rumored that the man prosecuting them was a childhood friend who purposely failed to prosecute Myles and Doherty for the murders of Klimas and Tancl. His name was William McSwiggin. He was one of Illinois' best prosecutors and prosecuted many criminals. McSwiggin got the nickname \\"Hanging Prosecutor\\" due to his ruthless tactics in taking down hard criminals, and he fully supported the death penalty as a final punishment. McSwiggin William McSwiggin was born and raised in the Chicago suburb of Cicero. McSwiggin, who usually went by the name Bill or Will, befriended the O'Donnell brothers and Doherty at a young age. He was known for his powerful, athletic build. His father was a police officer for many years. Unlike his hoodlum friends, his occupation was Illinois state prosecutor. On the night of April 27, 1926, McSwiggin was out bar-crawling in Cicero with James J. Doherty, and Thomas \\"Red\\" Duffy. An assailant with a machine gun attacked the group outside the Pony Inn saloon at 5613 W 12th St (now Roosevelt Rd). All three were killed. Death of Myles O'Donnell Sometime in early 1933, Myles O'Donnell was shot by a bartender during a drunken argument. Myles killed the bartender but was shot in the lung. He contracted pneumonia soon after and died on March 10, 1933. Myles was buried the same day as Mayor Anton Cermak, on March 10. Klondike took over the West Side rackets, but failed in his attempts to make them as profitable as they had been in the past. With the booze racket gone, Klondike tried to make ends meet with his fleet of trucks, supplying them to local Chicago gangster Jack \\"Three Fingered\\" White, who ran a labor union racket called TNT. This forced members to cough up payments and dues. After it got too messy the feds found out and shut the racket down again, leaving Klondike penniless. =O'Donnell mob members= *Myles O'Donnell - Leader and founder of the Westside/O'Donnell mob. *William \\"Klondike\\" O'Donnell - underboss. *Bernard O'Donnell - Brewery owner. *Jim Doherty - O'Donnell soldier, enforcer, gunman, best friend and right-hand man to Myles. *Thomas \\"Red\\" Duffy - Soldier. *Fur Sammons - Klondike's hit man, was considered by some to be a crazed rapist. *William McCue - O'Donnell beer deliverer, found killed in a ditch.

This one, the third, was established in 1901 on , several miles south of downtown Des Moines, and at the time outside the city boundary. Initially founded as a base for cavalry, the fort was built out beginning in 1903 with barracks, stables, officers' quarters, and other facilities for this use.

After the war, the fort housed veteran soldiers for a time, and was turned over to the city in the early 1950s. In 1949, a portion of the old post grounds became a U.S. Army Reserve training center, which it continues to the present.Fort Des Moines Museum, http://www.fortdesmoines.org/chronology.shtml Later history Much of the original 640-acre base was sold off for development as the city grew. The main surviving portion of the base, organized around the parade ground, is located at the northwestern corner of that land. Portions of the former base are now used as the Blank Park Zoo, and part of the parade ground has had an apartment complex built on it. Despite this, a number of the fort's buildings still stand, mainly on the southern and eastern edges of the parade ground. These buildings, including barracks, quarters, and stables, are now used for a variety of civic and commercial purposes. These surviving elements of the fort were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1974, in recognition of their role in the advancement of African Americans and women in the United States military forces. The Fort Des Moines Museum and Education Center honors the U.S. Army's first officer candidate class for African American men in 1917, and the establishment of the first Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC's) in 1942.

The piece was first performed at the Royal Gallery of Illustration on 3 July 1873, with Fanny Holland and Arthur Cecil starring in the two roles. It was performed again with the same cast on 5 May 1876 at the Princess's Theatre in London for Pauline Rita's benefit. The opera was revived on 17 November 1877 at the Opera Comique as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, which opened on the same night. It then ran until 7 or 8 February 1878, starring Giulia Warwick and Richard Temple. The curtain raiser debuted to a warm review from The Times, which wrote, \\"This pleasant and sparkling bagatelle at once put the house in good humour.\\"\\"Op√©ra Comique\\", The Times, 19 November 1877, p. 6, col. B No printed libretto or vocal score is found in the British Library, but the license copy of the libretto resides in the Lord Chamberlain's collection, Add. MS. 53194, play no. A, NovDec 1877. Only dialogue is given, not the lyrics of the songs, and in Cecil's original draft, it was apparently not intended to be performed with music. Background The fashion in the late Victorian era was to present long evenings in the theatre, and so producer Richard D'Oyly Carte preceded his Savoy operas with curtain raisers such as Dora's Dream.Lee Bernard. \\"Swash-buckling Savoy curtain-raiser\\", Sheffield Telegraph, 1 August 2008 W. J. MacQueen-Pope commented, concerning these curtain raisers: :This was a one- act play, seen only by the early comers. It would play to empty boxes, half- empty upper circle, to a gradually filling stalls and dress circle, but to an attentive, grateful and appreciative pit and gallery. Often these plays were little gems. They deserved much better treatment than they got, but those who saw them delighted in them. ... [They] served to give young actors and actresses a chance to win their spurs ... the stalls and the boxes lost much by missing the curtain-raiser, but to them dinner was more important.MacQueen- Pope, Walter James. Carriages at Eleven (1947), London: Robert Hale and Co., p. 23 A memorable line in the play is Fred's opinion of the perfect woman: \\"Order is a first rate quality in a wife. I maintain that if a girl cannot be born with a silver spoon in her mouth, she ought to be born with a bunch of keys at her waist.\\" Synopsis Setting: A drawing room in a villa in Putney. Fred Fancourt, a stockbroker, courts his cousin, Dora. He seeks a comfy, capable, dumpy little wife. Dora, on the other hand, has begun reading great literature and declares that she will only marry a poet. They play charades, and Fred takes the opportunity to show that poets are impossible to live with, while Dora shows how insufferable stockbrokers can be to their wives. Both dreams shattered, and the couple agrees to part. Eventually, however, they make up and (presumably) get married and live happily ever after.

He became general manager of the Adelsverein, or Verein zum Schutze Deutscher Einwanderer in Texas (\\"Society for the Protection of German Immigrants in Texas\\"). Verein zum Schutze Deutscher Einwanderer in Texas The Verein zum Schutze Deutscher Einwanderer in Texas was an emigration enterprise first organized by a group of German noblemen in 1842 that resulted in the founding of New Braunfels, Fredericksburg, and other German communities in Texas. August, as the director of the business affairs of Hermann, Prince of Wied, was privy from its inception to the development of the Verein. Hermann, Prince of Wied purchased a share in the society as he was engaged to the sister of Wilhelm, Duke of Nassau, the protector of the society. He took no active part in the society until 1847, when it became apparent because of debts and dissension, that a new more business like approach must be taken in order to save the reputations and investments of the noblemen. From 1847 on Bibra was actively involved in the affairs of the Verein; and, when the prince was elected president in 1851, Bibra took over complete management of the enterprise. Bibra struggled to repay the Verein debts and to revitalize the emigration program for more than ten years. He died in Germany in 1894. Family August was from the older line of the Irmelshausen branch of the von Bibra family. Born in Romrod, he was the child of Christian Ernst Heinrich von Bibra (1772‚Äì1844) and Luise Charlotte Amalia Riedesel zu Eisenbach (1781‚Äì1855). August was married to Agnes Freiin von Stoltzenberg (1823‚Äì1866). They had five children: Berthold, Marie, Maximilian, Luise Therese and Anna Carolina. At least some of the children were close friends of the future queen of Romania, Elisabeth of Wied.

Primacy of the General Assembly The chapter on the UN General Assembly appears in the Charter before the chapters on the other five principal organs (UN Security Council, UN Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship Council, International Court of Justice, and UN Secretariat). This reflects the UN's founders' view of the General Assembly as the \\"first\\" branch of the UN, in much the same way that the placement of the provisions related to the United States Congress in Article One of the United States Constitution before those dealing with the US President and US Supreme Court reflects the Philadelphia Convention's view of Congress as the \\"first branch\\" of the US government.Structure and Powers of Congress, D. R. Tarr, & A. O'Connor, Congress A to Z, CQ Encyclopedia of American Government, 2003. Both the US Congress and the UN General Assembly hold the \\"power of the purse\\" in regard to their respective organizations. No doubt, the General Assembly also appears first because most decisions (except those dealing with security matters) mentioned later in the Charter require General Assembly assent, and the General Assembly appoints: *10 of the 15 members of the Security Council; *All of the members of ECOSOC; *As many as half the members of the Trusteeship Council; *All of the judges of the International Court of Justice (with Security Council assent); and *The Secretary-General (upon the Security Council's nomination). Article 9 guarantees each member country a seat in the General Assembly, making it the only UN body with universal membership. Articles 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 Article 10 gives the General Assembly (UNGA) power to \\"discuss any questions or any matters within the scope of the present Charter or relating to the powers and functions of any organs provided for in the present Charter\\" and to make recommendations on those subjects. This, along with the Article 15 provision requiring the Security Council (UNSC) and other organs to issue reports of their activities to the General Assembly, essentially puts the General Assembly in the role of overseer over the other UN bodies (there is no reciprocal provision by which the Security Council or other bodies make recommendations as to the powers and functions of the General Assembly). Article 11 tasks the UNGA with considering \\"principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments\\" and making recommendations on the same to the UNSC, which under Chapter V has the responsibility of making more detailed plans in reference to disarmament. The UNGA is prohibited by Article 12 from making recommendations on matters currently being dealt with by the UNSC, unless requested to do so by the Council. However, this has not always prevented the General Assembly from attempting to deal with threats to international peace and security, in cases where the UNSC was deadlocked, by using the framework of the Uniting for Peace resolution (A/RES/377 A). Article 13 tasks the General Assembly with initiating studies and making recommendations for \\"promoting international co- operation in the political field and encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification.\\" This provides a clue as to the founders' hopes that the UN as formulated by the original Charter would be a first step toward a much more comprehensive framework of international law, whose development would be coordinated by the General Assembly. Article 16 grants the UNGA limited power over the trusteeship system. Article 17 Article 17 provides that \\"The General Assembly shall consider and approve the budget of the Organization.\\" The interpretation of section 2 is controversial. It reads: :2. The expenses of the Organization shall be borne by the Members as apportioned by the General Assembly. When the United States fell behind in paying its dues to the UN, some members held that the US was breaking its treaty obligations to bear the expenses of the Organization. In 1995, Malaysia said that any unilateral decision to reduce UN assessments is \\"illegal and totally unacceptable\\" and Australia said it \\"would not accept\\" a situation whereby \\"the largest contributor, by it failure to comply with the Charter, would destabilize the operation of the UN\\".Chronology of the UN Financial Situation: 1995, Global Policy Forum Another interpretation, advanced by the Cato Institute, is that \\"the intent is to make certain that the world body is financed by countries, not special interests outside the organization\\".The United Nations Debt: Who Owes Whom?, Cliff Kincaid, Cato Policy Analysis No. 304, Cato Institute, 23 April 1998. Article 18 Article 18 gives each state one vote in the UN General Assembly. The interpretation of Sections 2 and 3 are controversial. They read: :2. Decisions of the General Assembly on important questions shall be made by a two-thirds majority of the members present and voting. These questions shall include: recommendations with respect to the maintenance of international peace and security, the election of the non-permanent members of the Security Council, the election of the members of the Economic and Social Council, the election of members of the Trusteeship Council in accordance with paragraph 1 (c) of Article 86, the admission of new Members to the United Nations, the suspension of the rights and privileges of membership, the expulsion of Members, questions relating to the operation of the trusteeship system, and budgetary questions. :3. Decisions on other questions, including the determination of additional categories of questions to be decided by a two-thirds majority, shall be made by a majority of the members present and voting. The question of what constitutes an \\"important question\\" arose during the discussion of General Assembly Resolution 2758, which expelled the Taiwanese delegation from the UN and replaced it with the People's Republic of China. The General Assembly had declared, by a vote of 59 to 55 with 15 abstentions, this to be an unimportant question that did not require the consent of two-thirds of the members. The delegates of the Republic of China protested that this decision was illegal, and subsequently left the assembly hall. Article 18 was designed to provide a more workable system than that established by Article 5 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which provided for a consensus-based system in which \\"decisions at any meeting of the Assembly or of the Council shall require the agreement of all the Members of the League represented at the meeting.\\" Article 19 Article 19 provides that any country that falls two years behind in its dues will lose its vote in the General Assembly. The United States, when it was withholding dues in protest over the slow pace of UN reform, has historically paid just enough at the end of each year to avoid losing its vote under this provision. Rule 161 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly states that the Committee on Contributions shall \\"advise the General Assembly ... on the action to be taken with regard to the application of Article 19 of the Charter\\". According to the New York Times, \\"The fact that a member is in arrears and thus not entitled to vote is, by established practice, determined by the Secretary General through computation and reported to the Assembly by him or by the Committee on Contributions. Comparable situations in specialized agencies of the United Nations have shown that a member's loss of voting rights is mandatory and automatic and that the fact of his debt is a 'ministerial, mathematical calculation' rather than a political decision.\\" After a World Court ruling in the Certain Expenses case made it clear that Soviet and Soviet bloc countries, France, and Latin American countries had defaulted on peacekeeping debts, during the 19th session (1964-1965), no votes at all were taken in the General Assembly. It was ultimately decided to ignore that default rather than take away those countries' vote in the General Assembly. U.S. Ambassador Arthur Goldberg declared that \\"it is not in the world interest to have the work of the General Assembly immobilized in these troubled days.\\"5 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 68 (1966) United Nations Financing and the Law of the Charter In 1963, an announcement of Haiti's arrears by the president of the General Assembly at the opening plenary meeting was considered unnecessary because a formal vote count in the presence of a representative of Haiti did not take place.VOTING RIGHTS IN UNITED NATIONS OF STATES IN FINANCIAL ARREARS: EXCHANGE OF LETTERS OF SECRETARY-GENERAL AND PRESIDENT OF GENERAL ASSEMBLY International Legal Materials, 1 July 1963, Vol.2(4), pp.797-811 Circa 1969, the government of Haiti claimed it was unable to pay its dues due to cyclones Betty, Flora, and Ines, which over a period of seven years destroyed half its agriculture, its livestock, and its light industry.

It is normally served with salt and black pepper, and sometimes with garlic, caraway or chopped onion, and eaten raw, usually on a bread roll. At a buffet it is sometimes served as a Mettigel (mett hedgehog). It is also sold in the form of mettwurst, a spicy, raw sausage, often smoked. In Germany, laws require that no more than 35% of the mett is constituted by fat. Description The name is derived from Low German mett for \\"chopped pork meat without bacon\\", or Old Saxon meti for \\"food\\". It is also known as Hackepeter (Northern Germany, Eastern Germany and Berlin). It consists of minced pork meat, normally sold or served seasoned with salt and black pepper, regionally also with garlic or caraway, and eaten raw. It is also permitted to add chopped onion, in which case it is known as Zwiebelmett (onion Mett). Legally, German Mett is not allowed to contain more than 35% fat.Deutsches Lebensmittelbuch f√ºr Fleisch und Fleischerzeugnisse Unless pre-packaged, the German Lebensmittelhygiene-Verordnung (\\"food hygiene/health directive\\") permits mett to be sold only on the day of production. Varieties Schinkenmett (\\"ham Mett\\"), prepared from the upper thigh (ham), is considered especially fine. In contrast to the normally available locally minced Mett, coarse pork Mett (Grobes Schweinemett) is produced in an industrial meat grinder. To preserve its structure, the pork meat is normally processed in a semi-frozen state. Food and health Regulations do not permit temperatures over ; ice may not be used for cooling. Serving styles Raw Mett is normally eaten on bread roll (Mettbr√∂tchen) or sliced bread, frequently with a garnish of raw onion rings or diced raw onion. At buffets, Mett is occasionally served as a Mettigel (Mett hedgehog, also Hackepeterigel or Hackepeterschwein). This form of serving Mett was especially popular in the 1970s. To produce it, a large amount of Mett is shaped as a hedgehog, quartered onion rings or pretzel sticks are used as spikes, olives as eyes and nose. In parts of Southern Germany Mett (Mettstange) is served on a Lye bun instead of a regular bun. In southern Brazil, influenced by German immigrants, it is known as Hackepeter or Carne de On√ßa in Curitiba where this dish is very common and served covered with chives.

It can be considered a form of call and response. First referred to as \\"the old way of singing\\" in eighteenth-century Britain, it has influenced twentieth century popular music singing styles. In 1644, the Westminster Assembly outlined its usage in English churches \\"for the present, where many in the congregation cannot read\\". Lining out spread rapidly to the Scottish churches where it has persisted longest in Britain. It has survived to the present day among some communities and contexts, including the Gaelic psalmody on Lewis in Scotland, the Old Regular Baptists of the southern Appalachians in the United States, and for informal worship in many African American congregations. History Lining out first appears in 17th century Britain when literacy rates were low and books were expensive. Precenting the line was characterised by a slow, drawn-out heterophonic and often profusely ornamented melody, while a clerk or precentor (song leader) chanted the text line by line before it was sung by the congregation. It was outlined for use by the Westminster Assembly for English churches in 1644, and it has persisted longest in Britain in the Scottish Hebrides. Lining out was taken to American colonies by English and Scottish emigrants. Psalm-singing and gospel music are a mainstay of African American churchgoers. The great influx of Presbyterians from the Scottish Highlands into the Carolinas might have introduced some African slaves to this form of worship, though this extent to which this influenced African-American church singing has been disputed, due to the fact that English, lowland Scottish, and Ulster-Scots colonists, all of whom would have lined hymns, were far more numerous than the Highlanders in the region and could more easily have influenced the African Americans. The tide turned against lining out in England and New England in the first quarter of the 18th century, with greater literacy, improved availability of texts such as New Version of the Psalms of David (1696) by Nahum Tate and Nicholas Brady, and more widely available and better-printed tune collections. Influential clerics in England and America disliked the ragged nature of the singing that resulted as the congregation struggled to remember both the tune and the words from the lining out. However, it continued to be practiced in most rural churches and still survives today in a form which likely would have been familiar to the original English and Ulster-Scots colonists in isolated communities in the Appalachian mountains. Lining out was in most places replaced by \\"regular singing,\\" in which either the congregation knew a small number of tunes like Old 100th that could be fitted to many different texts in standard meters such as Long Meter, or a tunebook was used along with a word book. There began to be \\"singing societies\\" of young men who met one evening a week to rehearse. As time went on, a section of the church was allocated for these trained voices to sit together as a choir, and churches voted to end the lining out system (although there was often a transitional phase that had the entire congregation singing from tunebooks like the still-popular Sacred Harp and others, before this was taken over by using trained choirs; this gave birth to the still vibrant tradition of \\"Sacred harp singing\\"). We have a vivid picture of the transition in Worcester, Massachusetts: Current usage Some Christian churches in the U.S. still practice lining out. While some churches calling themselves Primitive Baptist or Regular Baptist use it, this form of singing predominates among the Old Regular Baptist churches. The practice is becoming attenuated in some of them‚Äîthe leader will begin lining out, but after the first verse or two will say \\"Sing on!\\", or a part of the service is lined out but other parts are not‚Äîso it is unclear how long it will survive. Some Presbyterian churches in Scotland also still do lining out, though often now in a restricted context, with other hymns being accompanied and not lined out. The practice is now more common in Gaelic psalm singing than in English, and indeed is often considered a characteristic of Gaelic culture, especially on the Isle of Lewis. Unlike other denominations that carry on the tradition of lining out, Gaelic churches practice Exclusive Psalmody. Lining of hymns is still widely practiced by the three traditional branches of the Hutterites (Lehrerleut, Dariusleut, Schmiedeleut II). It may also be heard among some conservative Anabaptist churches, such as German Baptist Brethren, Old Order Mennonites, and the Old Order River Brethren. In popular culture In the film Coal Miner's Daughter, lining out is depicted at the funeral of Loretta Lynn's father, Ted Webb. Bibliography * Dargan, William T. (2006).

Young Research Library The Charles E. Young Research Library is one of the largest libraries on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles in Westwood, Los Angeles, California. It initially opened in 1964, and a second phase of construction was completed in 1970. Interior renovations took place in 2009 and 2011. Located at the northern edge of the campus, the building was designed by A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Earl Emmons in the Mid- Century Modern style. Jones was the dean of USC's School of Architecture from 1951 to 1967. The building features a concrete skeleton, dark glass windows and deep floorplate. The upper floors of the library are meant primarily for faculty and graduate students who wish to conduct research. The library holds resources in the humanities, social sciences, education, public affairs, government information, journals, newspapers, and maps. History The eastern half of the building opened in 1964, and the western half in 1970; it was designed by architects A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Earl Emmons. Originally called the \\"University Research Library\\", in 1997 is was named for Charles E. Young, the university's second-longest serving chancellor (29 years). The building underwent major interior renovations in 2009 (A level) and 2011 (first floor), designed by Perkins and Will.\\"Research Library (Charles E. Young)\\" UCLA Library According to Metropolis Magazine, \\"In 1950, the late Ray Bradbury - a dedicated autodidact who spent three days a week at libraries in lieu of enrolling in college‚Äîentered the typewriter-rental room in the basement of UCLA‚Äôs Powell Library. With a roll of dimes and the kernel of a story, he holed up in front of a Royal typewriter and pounded out Fahrenheit 451, the cri de coeur for the importance of books that launched his long career. All it took was nine days and 98 dimes.\\" As part of renovations of the building's common areas, the library's cafe was named \\"Cafe 451\\" after, and a Bradbury quote was painted in a frequently-used stairwell: \\"Without libraries, what have we? We have no past, and no future.\\" Inside the Charles E. Young Research Library Renovations When Perkins and Will Architects undertook the renovation of the library's common areas - the traditional book stacks on the upper floors were not touched - they began meeting with different constituent groups to get a sense of what they would like to see in the new space, but the main impetus for a wholesale transformation came from UCLA University Librarian Gary Strong and Deputy University Librarian Susan Parker, both of whom understood the importance of introducing technology and collaborative thinking to the world of academic research. Because this is an A. Quincy Jones building, preservation was considered to be important. While the team retained the signature open staircase that runs through three floors of the building, they also added a scrolling ticker whose continuously scrolling text reminds users that there are floors above and below to explore. The original load-bearing concrete columns, which are spaced every 20 feet, were stripped of paint in order to expose the imprint of wood forms. The library's new research commons feature 22 technology-enabled \\"pods\\" capable of accommodating up to 10 users each. The area has been built specifically to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and discovery through serendipity. Each pod allows students and faculty to share content on laptops and other devices on large LCD monitors.

Adams was also briefly a member of the First Presidency in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). In preparation for colonizing Palestine, he changed his name to George Washington Joshua Adams, to tie himself to two well-known country builders: George Washington of the United States and Joshua of ancient Israel. Conversion and early church service Adams was born in Oxford, New Jersey of Welsh descent. By the 1830s, he had been trained as a Methodist preacher and was a merchant tailor. He was also an aspiring Shakespearean actor, but had little success in being cast in roles. While travelling from Boston to New York City in February 1840, Adams heard the preaching of Latter Day Saint apostle Heber C. Kimball, and was baptized into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the same week. Within a month he had become an elder in the church. In 1841, Adams traveled to England as a missionary for the church; he was successful in winning numerous converts and stayed in England for eighteen months. In October 1843, church president Joseph Smith asked Adams to travel with apostle Orson Hyde as a missionary to Russia. In 1844, Smith invited Adams to join the exclusive Council of Fifty. On June 7, 1844, Smith set apart Adams \\"to be an apostle and special witness ... to the empire of Russia\\", in preparation for the Mormon political kingdom.D. Michael Quinn (1994). The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power (Salt Lake City, Utah: Signature Books) p. 534. However, just prior to Adams' planned departure later that month, all church political efforts were suspended after Smith was killed and the church was thrown into turmoil. Adams returned to New England as a regular missionary, and, along with William Smith, Joseph Smith's surviving brother, created much turmoil among the branches there, claiming to be the \\"Thirteenth Apostle\\" and \\"greater than Paul,\\" and therefore having more authority than any of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. On April 10, 1845, Adams was excommunicated by the Quorum of Twelve Apostles for proposing that the church be led by Joseph Smith III (Joseph Smith's eldest son) under the guardianship of William Smith. Back in Boston in 1847, Adams was the main witness in the trial of Cobb v. Cobb, in which Henry Cobb sued his wife, Augusta Adams Cobb, for divorce, for having committed adultery with Joseph Smith's successor, Brigham Young; she had married Young in November 1843 without first divorcing Henry. The court case went to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, presided over by Chief Justice Lemuel Shaw, and was widely reported in newspapers nationwide. Strangite leader After his excommunication, Adams came to accept the spiritual leadership of James J. Strang, and in December 1846 became editor of Star in the East, a Strangite publication printed in Boston. He then was ordained Strang's counselor in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). In 1850, Adams crowned Strang with a metal crown as a spiritual \\"king of Israel\\", and Adams was appointed to be Strang's \\"prime minister\\" and \\"viceroy\\". However, by 1851, Adams had been excommunicated from the Strangite church on recurring charges of embezzlement, adultery, apostasy, and drunkenness. Church of the Messiah By the late 1850s, Adams had established a church in New England called the Church of the Messiah. Adams claimed to be a prophet of Jesus Christ to the world and began publication of a periodical called The Sword of Truth and Harbinger of Peace. In 1864, Adams established the headquarters of his church in Washington County, Maine, near the Canada‚ÄìUS border. Later that year, Adams announced a great mission whereby he and his followers would travel to and settle in Palestine. Adams taught that their colony could prepare the land for the return of the Jews, which in turn would hasten the Second Coming of Jesus. The members of the church donated much of their money to the church in an effort to realize Adam's proposal. Settlement in Palestine Adams' friendship with Orson Hyde heavily influenced his decision to move to Palestine. Hyde was the first Mormon envoy to Jerusalem, and Adams \\"dreamed of replicating Hyde's pilgrimage to the Holy Land.\\"Michael Oren (2007). Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present (New York: W.W. Norton & Company) p. 220. After migrating around the Northeast for some years, Adams settled in Indian River, Maine, and prophesied that the prerequisite the Second Coming was \\"the Jews' restoration to Palestine.\\" In 1865, Adams and Indian River's postmaster, Abraham McKenszie, traveled to Palestine and arranged for the purchase of a tract of land near Jaffa. Upon returning to the United States, Adams organized the Palestine Emigration Association to coordinate his church's move. In February 1866, Adams was received by U.S. President Andrew Johnson and Secretary of State William H. Seward at the White House. Seward agreed to expedite a petition from Adams and his church members to the government of the Ottoman Empire to ensure that the American settlers' title to the land Adams arranged to purchase was respected. One hundred and fifty-six members of the Church of the Messiah sailed from Boston to Jaffa on the Nellie Chapin, arriving on September 22, 1866. The colony began by camping on the beach, relying on local Arabs for food and water. Within a month, six children and three adults had died. By November, the colony had erected a number of simple frame houses. The pilgrims secured a plot of land outside of Jaffa, where they founded the American Colony, named Amelican in Arabic, or Adams City in English, between today's Rechov Eilat and Rechov haRabbi mi-Bacherach in Tel Aviv-Yafo. However, the settlers quickly encountered problems. Scavengers ravaged their crops and the community faced famine heading into the winter of 1866-67.Michael Oren (2007). Power, Faith, and Fantasy: America in the Middle East 1776 to the Present (New York: W.W. Norton & Company) p. 224. This and the climate, the insecure and arbitrary treatment by the Ottoman authorities, made many colonists willing to return to Maine. But their leader Adams withheld their money, which the colonists had earlier conveyed to him. So the missionary Peter Metzler of the Protestant mission in Jaffa bought the land of five colonists, providing them the funds to leave.Cf.

In April, a group of colonists appealed to the American consul to the Ottoman Empire for assistance in returning to America. By the end of the month, the U.S. government had arranged for 26 settlers to return. By the end of summer, after the colony's crop harvest was a disastrous failure, only Adams and 40 other settlers remained. By October 1867, the U.S. State Department had appropriated $3000 for the return of any of the remaining colonists who wished to leave Palestine, while by December 1867, the colony had run out of money and resources. Some of the colonists traveled back to America on the ship Quaker City; Mark Twain was a passenger on the same journey and he wrote about the failed settlers in his chapter 57 of his 1869 book The Innocents Abroad.But I am forgetting the Jaffa Colonists. At Jaffa we had taken on board some forty members of a very celebrated community. They were male and female; babies, young boys and young girls; young married people, and some who had passed a shade beyond the prime of life. I refer to the \\"Adams Jaffa Colony.\\" Others had deserted before. We left in Jaffa Mr. Adams, his wife, and fifteen unfortunates who not only had no money but did not know where to turn or whither to go. Such was the statement made to us. Our forty were miserable enough in the first place, and they lay about the decks seasick all the voyage, which about completed their misery, I take it. However, one or two young men remained upright, and by constant persecution we wormed out of them some little information. They gave it reluctantly and in a very fragmentary condition, for, having been shamefully humbugged by their prophet, they felt humiliated and unhappy. In such circumstances people do not like to talk.. Upon returning to the United States, many of Adams' former followers joined the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. In June 1868, Adams and his wife left Palestine and sailed to England. Twenty of the original colonists remained in Palestine, some of them permanently. The colonists who left would sell much of their real estate in the colony to newly arriving settlers, called Templers, coming from W√ºrttemberg in 1869. On 5 March 1869 also Metzler sold most of his real estate to the new colonists, thus Adams City became later known as the German Colony of Jaffa.Cf.

Return to America and death Although Adams preached briefly in Liverpool and tried to raise followers for a second attempt at settling Palestine, he had returned to America by 1870. He preached in Philadelphia and in 1873 opened a \\"Church of the Messiah\\" building for Sunday sermons. When confronted by his past exploits by former followers or others, Adams would deny his identity and past. He died in Philadelphia of \\"typhoid pneumonia\\".Philadelphia Public Ledger, 1880-05-13, p. 8. His only child, Clarence A.

Originally built with a beam of , she was eventually widened to . She has a scow-form bow and a keelless flat bottom. Its internal structure involves a then-experimental truss system to support the weight of heavy components, including the boilers and engines. Verity was built in 1927 at Dubuque, Iowa for the Inland Waterways Corporation, an arm of the United States Government, as SS Thorpe, as one of four towboats that inaugurated barge service on the upper Mississippi River. She was the first to move barges from St. Louis north to St. Paul. She remained in service there until 1940, when she was sold to Armco Steel Corp. and put in service on the Ohio River. Armco renamed her after their founder, George M. Verity. In 1960, George M. Verity was retired after 33 years of service on the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers, and in 1961, the boat was given to the City of Keokuk for use as a river museum.

He maintained that the Security Council's resolution of 1 September 1951 possessed, within the meaning of Article 25, a compelling force beyond that pertaining to any resolution of any other organ of the United Nations, in his view the importance of the resolution had to be envisaged in the light of Article 25, under which the decisions of the Council on matters affecting international peace and security assumed an obligatory character for all Member States.

The Court also said that an interpretation of the charter that limits the domain of binding decision only to those taken under Chapter VII would render Article 25 \\"superfluous, since this [binding] effect is secured by Articles 48 and 49 of the Charter\\", and that the \\"language of a resolution of the Security Council should be carefully analyzed before a conclusion can be made as to its binding effect\\".Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970) , Advisory Opinion of 21 June 1971 at paragraphs 87‚Äì116, especially 113.

De Wet argues that Chapter VI resolutions cannot be binding. Her reasoning, in part states: > Allowing the Security Council to adopt binding measures under Chapter VI > would undermine the structural division of competencies foreseen by Chapters > VI and VII, respectively. The whole aim of separating these chapters is to > distinguish between voluntary and binding measures. Whereas the pacific > settlement of disputes provided by the former is underpinned by the consent > of the parties, binding measures in terms of Chapter VII are characterized > by the absence of such consent. A further indication of the non-binding > nature of measures taken in terms of Chapter VI is the obligation on members > of the Security Council who are parties to a dispute, to refrain from voting > when resolutions under Chapter VI are adopted. No similar obligation exists > with respect to binding resolutions adopted under Chapter VII... If one > applies this reasoning to the Namibia opinion, the decisive point is that > none of the Articles under Chapter VI facilitate the adoption of the type of > binding measures that were adopted by the Security Council in Resolution > 276(1970)...

Professor Stephen Zunes asserts that \\"[t]his does not mean that resolutions under Chapter VI are merely advisory, however.

Life and career After high school, she was given a scholarship to the Cooper Union School of Engineering in Manhattan, where she obtained a bachelor's and master's degree. She went to obtain her Ph.D. in computer science from Columbia University in 1992, studying under professor Calton Pu. In October 1992, Massalin joined MicroUnity as a research scientist, where she became responsible for signal- processing modules and software architecture. =Synthesis= Massalin's first breakthrough product came while studying at Columbia. Massalin developed Synthesis, an operating system kernel that allocated resources, ran security and low-level hardware interfaces, and created executable code to improve performance. Synthesis optimized critical operating system code using run-time information, which was a new insight previous thought impractical. To support Synthesis, Massalin invented object-like data structures called Quajects, which contain both data and code information. Massalin is still working on broadband microprocessors.  Personal life  Her parents were Croatian refugees from Trieste. In the 1940s, they moved Astoria, Queens, New York, where her father became a construction worker.

It was first published as a series of four books between 2003 and 2005, and then released as one volume in 2007, by Jonathan Cape. The book is a mixture between cartoon and graphic novel that tells the story of Fluffy, a young rabbit (who doesn't think he is a rabbit) and his owner Michael Pulcino. The book is drawn with few colours, but has a high amount of detail. Fluffy thinks that Michael is his daddy and even though Michael makes it clear that this isn't so, Fluffy refuses to accept this. The story has themes of loneliness, however the characters come together in the end with a new sense of meaning to their lives. Fluffy is the character that keeps everyone together, and gives a childlike perspective of what is going on in the world.  Plot  = Part 1 = The story begins with Fluffy asleep in the living room in a cardboard box at night. He awakes when he hears a noise to find Miss Owers in the house, leaving Michael's room. Miss Owers is Fluffy's nursery school teacher who has an infatuation with Michael. The next day Michael and Fluffy go to the library where Fluffy gets a book on tractors. Michael is oblivious to Fluffy telling him how he is going to cut the pictures out of the book when they get home. When they get back to Michael's flat, he confesses to Fluffy that he isn't his father. Fluffy gets angry at this, and refuses to believe Michael. We then see Michael opening a letter from Miss Owers, which she has written as Michael hasn't been returning her calls. We also see many emails from Miss Owers in his inbox. This shows how needy she is being towards Michael, when he clearly doesn't want anything to do with her. The story then cuts to 'a few days later' and the general chaos of the house is shown as the phone is constantly ringing and Fluffy is making a general nuisance of himself. Michael then thinks about how he wants to get away from everything and decides to go and see his family in Sicily over land because he has a fear of flying. = Part 2 = Michael and Fluffy travel to Waterloo to get the train. Fluffy is anxious as he is worried that they won't know what time it is as there won't be a clock with 'English numbers'. At this point in the story, a dust particle is brought in to narrate parts of the story that needs explaining. In the train fluffy wondered off. Michael was very worried. There was a little girl that had been playing with fluffy the other day. Fluffy did not like the girl. Michael had a dream that the girl was eating fluffy so when he woke up and saw that fluffy wasn't next to him he got scared. Michael went to find the girl. When he entered her room she was eating a burrito with bunny ears coming out. When Michael saw that he snatched the burrito out of her hands. Then a man approached him and ask if he was looking for a bunny. When he turned around there he was in the guy's hands. The guy told Michael that he shouldn't let fluffy wonder off like that while he's getting breakfast. When the pair arrives in France and Fluffy decides he wants McDonald's. Michael suggests eating frogs legs which upset Fluffy and he decides he hates France. They finally get on the train to go to Rome where they meet some eccentric characters on the train. One of the people they meet on the train is a young girl called Sylvia who tells Fluffy 'I love you rabbit!' and he gets upset because he doesn't think that he is a rabbit. Michael has some strange dreams on the train, one of which involves Sylvia eating Fluffy. He awakes to a start and finds that Fluffy is not in bed anymore. He frantically searches around and goes to Sylvia's cabin where he finds her holding what looks like Fluffy but turns out to be a kipferl. He is reunited with Fluffy when a man who looks like the farmer in Fluffy's tractor book comes and finds Michael and returns Fluffy to him. Some snapshots show Fluffy and Michael on the journey to Sicily and it ends with Michael on the phone to his sister, Rosetta. She tells him that their mother has become a new-found Catholic and that his 'girlfriend' (Miss Owers) has been ringing their house. = Part 3 = This starts with the Pulcino family eating dinner together. Michael's mother - Alice, father - Joe, sister - Rosetta, and brother-in-law - Fabrizio are all eating steak together. Michael also has a brother - David, who the family doesn't mention much. AT dinner, Michael receives a phone call from Miss Owers gushing that she misses him a lot. The next day Fluffy's grandparents take him to Santa Maria La Scala for a picnic. Fluffy likes his ice cream because of the jam sauce on it, which he mistakes for ketchup. Michael was making the most of being alone, although sometimes being irritated by Miss Owers' persistent calls. Alice takes Fluffy to see Jesus at the cathedral, however Fluffy seems more interested in talking about tractors. Later on Fluffy draws a picture of Jesus and Spider-Man together which causes Alice and Rosetta to have an argument, as Rosetta is getting aggravated by her mother's new-found religion. When the family are at dinner Alice noticed that Fluffy wasn't eating his, and Fluffy says that he's not meant to eat steak because he is a bunny which shocks Michael, as he never thought that Fluffy would admit to being a rabbit. He then comforts Fluffy and tells him that it's okay because 'you're my fluffy bunny'. Michael then goes out to meet Fabrizio for drinks, but he does not turn up, and when Michael returns to the flat Rosetta calls him, saying that Fabrizio isn't answering his phone. They decide that she is just worrying about nothing as she had a recent argument with him and leave it at that. A few minutes later Miss Owers calls saying that she is in Sicily. Michael is shocked and looks stunned that Miss Owers would go that far. = Part 4 = Part 4 opens with Fluffy playing underneath the table whilst Alice is shouting that she is convinced that the Mafia has got Fabrizio. Michael receives a call from Miss Owers who says that she is outside the flat. He goes to see her and is quite distant towards her. After walking around for a while they sit on a bench and we see inside Michael's mind. He first imagines being completely honest with her and telling her that she is annoying and clingy, at which she literally melts away. He then realises that she's the only one that likes him so he decides to give it a go. It is at this point that Miss Owers realises that she feels horrible when she is with Michael and decides that it is best that she just left anyway. Later on Michael is left with Fluffy, and they go for a walk, where they see a horse which Fluffy dislikes. On the way Fluffy finds a tractor that was left on the floor, and as this is happening Michael is on the phone to his mother who is telling him that Fabrizio was mugged by some youths on mopeds. Michael feels empty and lonely, until he realises that Fluffy was always there for him and he should have been a lot more like Fluffy and just enjoy the simple things. The dust particle then goes on to narrate how perfect everything was in that one moment. The story ends with Michael and Fluffy walking away with the tractor. = Epilogue = After the story ends, there is a short sketch between the dust particle and a flake of dandruff. They explain what happens between the other characters after the story is over. Rosetta and Fabrizio become much closer after the accident. Miss Owers discovers a new independence through traveling. Joe and Alice spend quality time together, and they receive a letter from David, telling them that they have a grandson. Finally, Sylvia has found happiness as she broke her leg and the nurse who looked after her was kind to her and looked after her.

Article 23 https://www.un.org/en/documents/charter/chapter5.shtml establishes the composition of the Security Council, with five permanent members (the Republic of China, (currently People's Republic of China), France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States) and 10 non-permanent members elected by the General Assembly. The non-permanent members serve two year terms and cannot be immediately re-elected. In the selection process for these non-permanent members, the treaty calls for \\"due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of Members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to the other purposes of the Organization, and also to equitable geographical distribution.\\" Article 24 gives the Security Council \\"primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\\" and requires the Security Council to act in accordance with the UN's purposes and principles. Article 25 requires members to \\"accept and carry out the decisions of the Security Council,\\" a mandate that does not apply with respect to the decisions of any other UN body, with the exception of the World Court's decisions once a country has accepted its jurisdiction. Article 26 reflects a pro-disarmament sentiment: :In order to promote the establishment and maintenance of international peace and security with the least diversion for armaments of the world's human and economic resources, the Security Council shall be responsible for formulating, with the assistance of the Military Staff Committee referred to in Article 47, plans to be submitted to the Members of the United Nations for the establishment of a system for the regulation of armaments. Nonetheless, the language employed here is considerably softer than that of Article 8 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which stated: :The Members of the League agree that the manufacture by private enterprise of munitions and implements of war is open to grave objections. The Council shall advise how the evil effects attendant upon such manufacture can be prevented, due regard being had to the necessities of those Members of the League which are not able to manufacture the munitions and implements of war necessary for their safety. The Security Council made its first real effort on disarmament in June 1968 when it adopted Resolution 255, which contained assurances for non-nuclear weapon states.The Security Council and Nuclear Weapons, Dr. Nabil Elaraby, 28 May 1996. Some observers believe that today, the UNSC is not fulfilling its mandate under Article 26.Article 26, Dr. David Krieger, Nuclear Age Peace Foundation, 20 May 1996. Article 27 Article specifies the UNSC's voting procedures. Nine of fifteen members, including all five permanent members, must concur in order for the UNSC to act on a non-procedural measure. The requirement of the P-5's unanimous assent establishes the famous \\"great power veto,\\" which deadlocked the UNSC throughout most of the Cold War and has prevented the UNSC from authorizing military action on many occasions, including the Iraq War. It was also used by the U.S. to block re-appointment of UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. There has been much debate on the veto. Some have interpreted its purpose as being primarily to prevent military action being taken against any member of the P-5; these observers therefore favor limiting the veto to that purpose and not using it for questions such as nomination of a UN Secretary-General. Procedural measures are not subject to veto, which allows the Security Council to discuss topics over the objection of a veto holding member. 1965 amendment Originally, there were 11 members of the UN Security Council, with the assent of 7 (including the Permanent Five) being required for a decision. In 1965, in recognition of the growing membership of the organization, the Charter was amended to expand the UNSC to 15 members, with the assent of 9 (again including the Permanent Five) being needed to make a decision.

He was born in Queen Street, Mayfair. His father was a German-speaking musician and composer, Nicolaus Joseph H√ºllmandel (1751‚Äì1823), a native of Strasbourg who became a pupil of C. P. E. Bach and from 1780 spent ten years as a fashionable music teacher in Paris. In 1787 he married a Mademoiselle du Cazan, who was of a noble French family, and in 1789 sent his wife to England, following her in 1790, as the French Revolution unfolded.'H√ºllmandel, Nicolaus Joseph (1751‚Äì1823)' in Philip H.

He learned printmaking and printed many of his own works.The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review, vol. 189 (1851), p. 209 In 1818, he set up a printing press in London after a visit to Munich with Rudolph Ackermann,Antiquarian Book Monthly Review, vol. 3 (1976), p. 291 and went on to study chemistry under Michael Faraday for the purpose of improving his printing. During the first half of the 19th century Hullmandel became one of the most important figures in the development of British lithography, and his name appears on the imprints of thousands of lithographic prints. He developed a method for reproducing gradations in tones and for creating the effect of soft colour washes which enabled the printed reproduction of Romantic landscape paintings of the type made popular in England by J. M. W. Turner. Hullmandel's essay The Art of Drawing on Stone (1824) was an important handbook of lithography. In 1843 he went into partnership with Joseph Fowell Walton (born 1812, living 1863), a cousin of the landscape artist and lithographer W. L. Walton, the firm then becoming known as Hullmandel & Walton.Michael Twyman, \\"Hullmandel, Charles Joseph (1789‚Äì1850)\\", in Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 9 October 2007 The Aventino, from Twenty-four views of Italy (1818) The Monte Pincio, from Twenty-four views of Italy (1818) He died at Westminster in 1850.The Annual Register for 1850, p. 280 Further reading * References External links * Pictures of C.

It is a speciality of the Roman Ghetto, where it is served by Jewish restaurants in the springtime. In English the dish is usually referred to with the standard Italian spelling Carciofi alla giudea;David, pp. 164‚Äì5Gray and Rogers, p. 146Davidson, p. 36: carciofini alla giudea this spelling may be found in Italian sources as well,Cervellati p. 95 but the Roman dialect name is much more commonly used. Preparation Artichokes of the Romanesco variety, which are harvested between February and April in the coastal region northwest of Rome between Ladispoli and Civitavecchia, are the best for this dish. The artichokes are cleaned with a sharp knife, eliminating all the hard leaves with a spiral movement. They are then beaten together to open them. They are left for some minutes in water with lemon juice, then seasoned with salt and pepper and deep fried in olive oil. The last touch consists in sprinkling a little cold water on them to make them crisp. At the end they look like little golden sunflowers and their leaves have a nutty crunchiness. They are eaten warm.Malizia (1995), pg. 55 Kashrut In 2018, the Chief Rabbinate of Israel declared that the artichokes are not kosher, since the dense leaves could conceal non-kosher insects. This sowed consternation among Roman Jews, who resisted the declaration, argued that the artichokes used for this signature dish have leaves so tight that insects cannot enter, and emphasized the importance and deep cultural roots of the dish for the Italian Jewish community.

This range forms a major divide between drainage basins draining into the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. The tallest peak, Mount Bendeleben is at the summit, and is located on the west end. Bits of the range go into the Bering Land Bridge National Preserve, but most of the peaks remain unclaimed. The Tubutulik River flows in the area. Mount Bendeleben is the highest point on the Seward Peninsula east of the Kigluaik Mountains. According to the geologists who studied contiguous areas in 1900, the metamorphic schists of the Bendeleben Mountains were considered distinct from the other schists of the region and were therefore given a name and assigned to a more or less definite stratigraphic position. In 1908, the senior writer of this report made a cross section of the range along the western margin of the area, and in 1909 the party had the opportunity of studying the section north and west. of Death Valley, where rocks previously considered as belonging to the Kigluaik group are exposed. About the head of the Fish River, the mountains are chiefly granitic, but along their flanks and sometimes extending through them in belts of varying breadth which mark the passes are areas of schistose sediments. Similar to the Kigluaik Mountains, the Bendeleban Mountains are rugged, with sharply cut valleys, and many glacial cirques. Flora On the southern side of the Bendeleben Mountains, scattered spruce trees are reported in the valley of the Niukluk River as far west as Libby River, which rises on the west side of Mount Bendeleben. Eastward, spruce grows along all the streams. On the northern side of the Bendeleben Mountains, spruce is found in the valley of the Koyuk River, west to the vicinity of Timber Creek on the south, and to the tributaries heading toward Kiwalik Mountain on the north. Spruce extends considerably farther west on the south side of the Bendeleben Mountains than it does on the north.

Plot When intergalactic rock star Sky Rocker plays a concert at the Cosmic Coliseum, Judy Jetson and her friends go into orbit. Starry-eyed Judy gets to meet her idol and gives him a song which she has written just for him, \\"Rockin' Round the Galaxy\\". But also at the concert are henchmen of the evil, music-hating Felonia. They are carrying a secret code that will unlock the powers of the Mental Flosser and enable Felonia to control the universe and banish music forever! The secret code accidentally gets switched with Judy's song, and Sky unwittingly turns it into a new rock hit. A depressed Judy takes refuge at the Crater Club, where her dad George Jetson, disguised as a punk-rocker, tries to save her from Sky. But Sky has already been kidnapped by Felonia, and then Judy disappears. Her captors, however, are the Zoomies, an outer-space race of party animals who love music and desires of vanquishing Felonia. Felonia finds Judy and prepares to do away with her and Sky. They escape, but it may be too late. Felonia has already activated the Mental Flosser. Then Judy and Sky hit on the solution that will stop Felonia ‚Äì music! They jam on Judy's song and send the beat vibrating around the galaxy. The sound overpowers the Mental Flosser and vanquishes Felonia. With the galaxy now safe, Sky resumes his tour, but as his alter ego Billy Booster, with Judy as his new opening act.

Life and work Allen was born in Lambeth, London, the son of a schoolmaster, and attended St Paul's School. Later, he worked for a time as an usher at a school in Taunton in Somerset. Discovering a talent for art, he returned to London, determined to become a painter. He initially found employment as an assistant to an art dealer, under whom he acquired a considerable knowledge of the old masters, and the monetary value of their works. He then became a (theatre) scene painter, in association with Charles Tomkins and Clarkson Stanfield, and painted most of the scenery during Lucia Vestris's first tenure of the Olympic Theatre in Drury Lane. His natural talent, however, was for painting pastoral landscapes, and his work soon attracted admirers and purchasers. The Vale of Clwyd, exhibited in 1847, created a considerable sensation, and was purchased by an Art Union prizeholder for three hundred guineas - Allen repeated it twice in smaller dimensions, for other purchasers. His Leith Hill (1848), was almost equally successful. His subjects consisted chiefly of views in North Wales, Cheshire, Yorkshire, and the midland counties. His first paintings were watercolour but later he switched to oils. Eleven of his pictures were exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts. Allen was active in the establishment of the Society of British Artists and became its secretary, his loyalty to the newly formed organisation shown by the fact that he refused to exhibit anywhere else in London apart from its Gallery in Suffolk Street. There is little doubt that his presence heightened the reputation of the society for landscape painting. He was also professor of drawing at the City of London School, from its opening in 1834. Allen died in 1852. His pupils included Edward John Cobbett. Three of his paintings were bought for the Royal Collection by Prince Albert, and on his death, his wife and children being left in poverty, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert contributed ¬£25 towards their support. One of his paintings, of Bath from Lyncombe Hill, hangs in the Building of Bath Collection. Two of his watercolours are in the Faringdon Collection (London), part of the Buscot Park collection. Others of his works are held by the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Tate, Eton, and the British Museum.

The film was directed by Franco Zeffirelli and starred Pl√°cido Domingo in the title role, Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona and Justino D√≠az as Iago. For the movie's soundtrack, Lorin Maazel conducted the Orchestra and Chorus of the Teatro alla Scala. The film premiered in West Germany on 28 August 1986 and received a U.S. theatrical release on 12 September 1986. It was nominated for a Bafta Award and a Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.  Plot  With only a few exceptions, the film follows the same plot as the opera. Iago plots and brings about Otello's downfall by convincing him that his wife Desdemona is engaged in an affair with the young lieutenant Cassio, provoking Otello to murder her in a blind rage. However, in a major change from the opera, Otello kills Iago at the end by throwing a spear at him, while in the stage version he only wounds him with his sword. Cast * Pl√°cido Domingo as Otello * Katia Ricciarelli as Desdemona * Justino D√≠az as Iago * Petra Malakova as Emilia * Urbano Barberini as Cassio * Massimo Foschi as Lodovico * Edwin Francis as Montano * Sergio Nicolai as Roderigo * Remo Remotti as Brabantio * Antonio Pierfederici as Doge Production Menachem Golan and Yoram Globus of Cannon Films worked out a deal with popular operatic tenor Pl√°cido Domingo to finance him in a film version of an opera. They wanted the singer to appear in an adaptation of Verdi's Il trovatore. Domingo, however, suggested instead that they film Otello, his signature role. While working with Italian director Franco Zeffirelli on a stage production of Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera, Domingo discussed the possibility of collaborating again on another opera movie. They had previously made television versions of Cavalleria rusticana and Pagliacci together, as well as a theatrically released movie of Verdi's La Traviata. Zeffirelli agreed to direct Domingo in Otello. Shooting was scheduled to begin in 1985 at Heraklion, Crete. Soon before the filming was to start, Mexico City was devastated by a massive earthquake. Domingo cancelled all his engagements in order to help with rescue efforts. Once the project came close to being scrapped, Domingo agreed to appear in Crete for the filming. Zeffirelli later recalled that the tenor used his hard work on Otello to help forget the traumatic sights in Mexico of the injured and dead (which included some of his family members). Music For the most part, the film follows the original score of the opera with several noticeable exceptions. The entire \\"Willow Song\\" (\\"Salce, salce\\"), Desdemona's solo aria, which is largely considered one of the most beautiful moments in the work, is omitted. However, her \\"Ave Maria\\", which follows immediately, is retained in the film. There are, at various points, smaller additional cuts in the music, such as the moment at the end of the storm scene when the chorus is cut short and the film skips to the recitativo between Iago and Roderigo. This contrasts with stage productions of Otello, where the opera is rarely cut. There are also two additions: the extra music from the rarely performed third act ballet (written for the opera's Paris premiere) is inserted into the festivities of the first and third acts in the film. In some scenes, Zeffirelli was able to use the medium of film to show aspects of his interpretation that could not be done onstage. In the movie, when Iago is informing Otello about Cassio's supposed dream in which he apparently said to Desdemona, \\"Let us hide our loves\\", we see Cassio singing the words, not Iago, as in the original stage version. Here Zeffirelli is showing the audience the image of Iago's fabricated dream as Otello is imagining it. Another of Zeffirelli's interpretive decisions was to show, complete with screams and sound effects, a flashback of marauding soldiers attacking an African village and snatching Otello (as a baby) from his mother, while the adult Otello and Desdemona sing their Act I love duet. On the soundtrack album of the opera, released by EMI, the music is presented with no cuts or additions, as it is when Otello is performed on the stage. The soundtrack album, however, has not proved to be as popular as Pl√°cido Domingo's first recording of the opera, conducted by James Levine and released in 1978 by RCA Victor. Reception Otello was named Best Foreign Film of 1986 by the U.S. National Board of Review of Motion Pictures. It was nominated for a Bafta Award for the Best Foreign Language Film in 1987, but the award was won by Akira Kurosawa's Ran. In the same category, it was also nominated for a Golden Globe. The film was also entered into the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. Leonard Maltin, in his Movie and Video Guide, called the film \\"nearly flawless\\". Vincent Canby in the New York Times, however, criticized Zeffirelli for some of his alterations to the opera's music. In an interview in Opera News, the film's star, Pl√°cido Domingo, expressed similar displeasure in the movie's musical cuts. He also complained that the synchronization of the soundtrack with the film was improperly done, rendering the music half a step lower than it was recorded. In regard to his interpretation of Otello, he felt that some camera cutaways undermined what he was trying to express in his characterization. Overall, he deemed it a \\"good film\\" that \\"could have been better\\".

Synopsis  The essays cover a broad range of topics, including evolution, the workings of the human mind, and science itself. A common focus of responders are the issue of extra-terrestrial life and the question of whether humanity has a supranatural element beyond flesh and blood. Among the more esoteric topics is the question of cockroach consciousness. A pervasive theme, according to Publishers Weekly, is the discomfort responders felt in professing unproven beliefs, which Publishers Weekly declared \\"an interesting reflection of the state of science\\". The question inspired implicit or explicit reflection in a number of responders about the scientific method's reliance on observable, empirical and measurable evidence, with a good many of what The Observer points out as largely American responders defending against \\"a return to an age of uncertainty in which creationism and intelligent design hold sway in the public mind\\".Adams, Tim.

He was the third but second surviving son of Christian I, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg and Christiana of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. Life In order to provide his three younger sons with an income befitting their status, Duke Christian I, assigned to each of them before his death a small territory as appanage; however, these territories remained dependent on the senior Saxe- Merseburg line, and their sovereign powers were severely limited. August received the town of Z√∂rbig in 1691 and founded the line of Saxe-Merseburg- Z√∂rbig. In consequence, August relocated his household from Alt-Stargard, which he had received from his father-in-law as a dowry, to Z√∂rbig. His rule there caused the town to flourish in an exceptional manner. In particular, he continued the reconstruction measures started by his father in the region damaged by the Thirty Years' War. In 1694 he ordered Castle Z√∂rbig to be rebuilt into a new and comfortable residence; however, August died before the works were finished. After his death, the castle was assigned to his widow Hedwig and their only surviving daughter Caroline as their residence. Duke August died on 27 March 1715 at the age of 60. His body was conveyed to Merseburg and entombed in an ostentatious coffin made from tin in the princely crypt of Merseburg Cathedral. Since he had no surviving male heir, the territory of Saxe-Merseburg-Z√∂rbig was reunited with the duchy of Saxe- Merseburg, and his appanage returned to the Saxe-Merseburg line represented by his nephew Maurice Wilhelm who, however, passed it to August's widow as a life estate. Marriage and issue On 1 December 1686 August married Hedwig of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow in G√ºstrow. They had eight children: #Christiane Magdalene (b. Z√∂rbig, 11 March 1687 - d.

Campbell Field, is an American college football stadium located in Golden, Colorado. The stadium serves as the home field of the Colorado Mines Orediggers football team representing the Colorado School of Mines. Campbell Field is one of the oldest football fields in existence, the oldest west of the Mississippi River and the oldest in NCAA Division II. Originally it was a dirt surface all-purpose athletic field in exactly its current configuration, built within a clay pit, a fitting mined-out home for the Orediggers. Its first athletic contest, held on May 20, 1893, was the first annual Colorado Inter-Collegiate Athletic Association Field Day, featuring many athletic contests between the University of Colorado, Colorado A&M;, Colorado School of Mines, and the University of Denver, in which Mines claimed the most medals. Its first football game took place on October 7, 1893, a 6-0 Mines victory over the University of Denver. It has been home to the football Orediggers through all but the first five seasons of their existence (their previous home were the now-destroyed grounds at the southeast corner of 19th and Illinois streets in Golden), and has been renovated several times throughout its existence. The field was originally called Athletic Park, renamed Brooks Field after Mines trustee and benefactor Ralph D. Brooks in 1922, and renamed Campbell Field after 1939 undefeated team member and benefactor Harry D. Campbell in 2010. Harry D. Campbell also was a football teammate of the legendary Jackie Robinson at Pasadena Junior College. Campbell Field is the oldest football field in the west, the oldest in NCAA Division II football and the 5th oldest college football field in the nation. Renovations Historic photographs show Brooks Field as a dirt surface, without grandstands and surrounded by a board fence. Despite such conditions it is known to have hosted crowds of spectators, who could have used nearby slopes to view games from. Later early wooden grandstands were added to the park. In 1922 and 1924 the current grandstands were built by noted local builder William \\"Cement Bill\\" Williams. This featured wooden bench seats upon a steel superstructure, with home and visiting locker rooms, public restrooms and refreshment stand beneath. In 1922 the dirt surface was converted to natural grass, part of which was scraped back to dirt surface for a baseball diamond during season each year. Originally home also to the CSM baseball team, it became a primarily football facility in 1937 after baseball was moved to Darden Field just to the west. During the 1930s a Federal Emergency Relief Administration project scooped out the slopes at the west side of Brooks Field to make room to construct a track around the surface, and it has hosted track and field events since. Around the 1980s the grandstands were renovated to cover most wooden benches with metal surfaces and create a central concourse, along with steps down to the field level. In 2010, the field was converted to its third surface, synthetic turf. Plans are underway to replace the 90-year- old grandstands and update the historic field to a state-of-the-art Division II athletic facility, expanding its capacity to 5,000, to be rechristened Marv Kay Stadium at Campbell Field. Notable Events Campbell Field has hosted many notable athletes and teams over its many years of play. Although missing out on the legendary 103-0 victory of the Orediggers over the University of Colorado in 1890 as well as their first Colorado Football Association championship in 1891, it has hosted 14 championship football teams and more: * Campbell Field hosted the latter part of the Orediggers' 18-game football winning streak against collegiate teams that spanned from 1888‚Äì1894. * The 3rd perfect and 4th unbeaten season of the football Orediggers took place here in its inaugural season in 1893 (5-0-0, CFA Champions). * Campbell Field hosted the latter half of the football Orediggers' streak of 6 winning seasons from 1888‚Äì1894. * CSM's earliest known football loss at Campbell Field took place in 1894 to the University of Colorado (a 20-0 shutout). * The first live televised football game in the Rocky Mountain region took place here on November 1, 1952, a game between the Orediggers and Idaho State University. * The first live nationally televised football game in the Rocky Mountain region took place here on November 15, 1952, a game between the Orediggers and Colorado College. * The only football playoff game at Campbell Field took place on November 13, 2004 as the Orediggers beat Midwestern State University.

It is based on the 1853 opera La traviata with music by Giuseppe Verdi and libretto by Francesco Maria Piave. Soprano Teresa Stratas, tenor Pl√°cido Domingo, and baritone Cornell MacNeil starred in the movie, in addition to singing their roles. The film premiered in Italy in 1982 and went into general release there the following year. It opened in theatres in the U.S. on April 22, 1983. The movie's soundtrack with James Levine conducting the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus won a Grammy Award for Best Opera Recording. Plot The film opens in the Paris home of courtesan Violetta Val√©ry, where sheets cover the furniture in dimly lit rooms. Creditors, appraisers, and movers are removing much of the artwork and ornate furnishings. One of them curiously wanders through the rooms, until he comes upon Violetta, bedridden and looking pallid and weak, and he stares at her with undisguised awe. She is startled to see him and follows him to see what he is doing. As she gazes down the long hallway, her delirious mind drifts back to a happier time, and via flashback we are transported to a lavish party she is hosting to celebrate her recovery from an illness. One of her guests, Count Gastone, has brought with him his friend, the young nobleman Alfredo Germont, who has long adored Violetta from afar. She becomes dizzy and retires to her bedroom to recover; he follows her and declares his love. At first Violetta rejects him, telling him love means nothing to her, but she is touched by his concern and offers him a camellia, telling him to return it when it has wilted. He promises to see her the next day. Three months pass, and Violetta and Alfredo are living together in a peaceful country house outside Paris. She has fallen deeply in love with him and has abandoned her former life. When Alfredo learns from the maid Annina her mistress has ordered her to sell the horses, carriages, and everything owned by Violetta in order to finance their lavish lifestyle, Alfredo leaves for Paris immediately to handle matters himself. During his absence, his father Giorgio arrives and requests that, for the sake of his family, Violetta end her relationship with his son. Violetta's unsavory reputation has threatened his daughter's engagement. After declaring her love for Alfredo, she reluctantly agrees to Giorgio's demand. He kisses her forehead in a gesture of gratitude for her sacrifice and leaves. Violetta is in the midst of writing a letter of farewell to Alfredo when he enters. She tells him repeatedly of her unconditional love before rushing out and handing the letter to her servant to give to Alfredo. Giorgio returns and attempts to comfort his son, who suspects Barone Douphol is the real reason Violetta left. When he finds an invitation from Flora Bervoix on the desk, he decides to confront Violetta at the party. Violetta arrives with Baron Douphol, who challenges Alfredo at the gambling table. Alfredo wins large sums of money, and when everyone goes into the dining room for supper, Violetta - fearful the Baron's anger at losing will lead him to challenge Alfredo to a duel - asks Alfredo to leave. He misunderstands her apprehension and demands she admit she loves Douphol. When she does, an infuriated Alfredo humiliates and denounces her in front of the other guests, then throws his winnings at her for the \\"services\\" she performed for him while they lived together. Giorgio, having arrived in search of his son, witnesses the scene and castigates Alfredo for his boorish behavior. Flora and the ladies try to escort Violetta from the room but, before departing, she turns to him and tells him he cannot fathom the love she has for him within her heart. Back in Violetta's home, Dr. Grenvil advises Annina her mistress' tuberculosis has worsened and she doesn't have long to live. Giorgio sends Violetta a letter telling her he has informed Alfredo of the sacrifice she made for him and his sister, and that he is sending his son to see her. Alfredo arrives and suggests they leave Paris, but Violetta knows the end is near. Giorgio rushes in and begs her forgiveness. Violetta presents Alfredo with a locket with her picture and asks him to remember her, while at the same time urging him to marry if he falls in love again. \\"How strange,\\" she murmurs, \\"the spasms have stopped.\\" With a peaceful smile on her face, she lifts herself from the bed and reaches to the daylight. \\"I am returning to life!,\\" she cries, then falls to the floor. Production notes Zeffirelli tried to adapt to cinema, but he failed it. One of then was La traviata performed by Maria Callas. Zeffirelli sent her a letter but she refused the film twice. For the movie, the opera's score was performed by the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra under the leadership of James Levine. Secondary characters and extras were also sung by members of the Metropolitan. Among the voices of these secondary characters (portrayed by actors in the film) are Ariel Bybee, Geraldine Decker, Charles Anthony, Ferruccio Furlanetto, and Russell Christopher.

Verdi's genius will out, especially when presented with the talent, intelligence and style that have gone into this production . . . Miss Stratas not only sings magnificently but she also looks the role . . . [she] is a screen presence as riveting to watch as to listen to. It's an acting performance of breathtaking intensity . . . La Traviata benefits from Mr. Zeffirelli's talents as a designer as much as from his gifts as a director. The physical production is lush without being fussy. Nor is it ever overwhelming. This possibly is because at key moments we are always aware of details that, however realistic, remind us that what we are witnessing is not life but a grand theatrical experience. It's not to be missed.\\" New York Times review Awards and nominations *Academy Award for Best Art Direction (Franco Zeffirelli, Gianni Quaranta - nominees) *Academy Award for Best Costume Design (nominee) *Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film (nominee) *BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Language Film (nominee) *BAFTA Award for Best Costume Design (winner) *BAFTA Award for Best Production Design (winner) *Nastro d'Argento for Best Costume Design (winner) *Nastro d'Argento for Best Production Design (winner) *Nastro d'Argento for Best Cinematography (winner) References External links  Category:1983 films Category:1980s musical films Category:Italian musical films Category:Italian films Category:Films directed by Franco Zeffirelli Category:Films based on operas by Giuseppe Verdi Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in the 19th century Category:Universal Pictures films Category:Giuseppe Verdi Category:Opera films ","title":"La Traviata (1983 film)"},{"id":"13638478","text":"Anna Rice Cooke (September 5, 1853 ‚Äì August 8, 1934) was a patron of the arts and the founder of the Honolulu Museum of Art. Biography Anna Charlotte Rice was born on September 5, 1853, into a prominent missionary family on Oahu, Hawaii. Her father was teacher William Harrison Rice (1813‚Äì1863), and her mother was Mary Sophia Hyde. Anna grew up on the island of Kauai. She attended Punahou School (then called Oahu College) 1867‚Äì1868, and Mills College 1871‚Äì1872. In 1874, she married Charles Montague Cooke, a successful businessman, and the two eventually settled in Honolulu. Ones of her sons was Charles Montague Cooke, Jr. (1874‚Äì1948), an American zoologist. Other children were Clarence H. Cooke, George P. Cooke, Richard A. Cooke, Alice T. Cooke and Theodore A. Cooke. In 1882, the Cookes built a home on Beretania Street, across from Thomas Square Park. In the time, they had unobstructed views of Diamond Head and Punahou School from their second-story windows. As Cooke's career prospered, they began to gather their own private fine art collection. Anna's first additions were \\"parlor pieces\\" that graced their Beretania Street home. She frequented the shop of furniture maker Yeun Kwock Fong Inn who often had ceramics and textile pieces sent from his brother in China. Fong Inn eventually became one of Honolulu's leading art importers. Anna was an advocate for local artists, especially Charles W. Bartlett. She hosted exhibitions in her home and introduced artists to her wealthy friends. Honolulu Academy of Arts The Cookes‚Äô art collection outgrew their own home and the homes of their children. In 1920, she and her daughter Alice (Mrs. Phillip Spalding), her daughter-in-law Dagmar (Mrs. Richard Cooke), and Catharine E. B. Cox (Mrs. Isaac Cox), an art and drama teacher, began to catalogue and research the collection with the intent to display the items in a museum for the children of Hawaii. With little formal training, these women obtained a charter for the museum from the Territory of Hawaii in 1922, while continuing to catalogue each art treasure in the collection. In 1924, Cooke hired the painter Frank Montague Moore as the first director of the Honolulu Museum of Art. From the beginning, she wanted a museum that reflected the unique attributes of Hawaii's multi-cultural make-up. The Cookes donated their Beretania Street home for the museum, along with an endowment of $25,000 and several thousand works of art. Their family home was torn down to make way for the new museum. New York architect Bertram Goodhue designed the plans for a classic Hawaiian-style building with the mountains as a backdrop and colorful blossoming trees, flowers, and shrubs complementing the simple off-white exteriors and tiled roofs. Goodhue died before the project was completed. Stepping in to finish the job was Hardie Phillip. Over the years, this unique style has been imitated in many buildings throughout the state. On April 8, 1927, the Honolulu Museum of Art opened. On August 8, 1934, Cooke died quietly in her home.

Origin of the name Miyagishima During Japan's Bunji era (1185 to 1190 CE), a samurai named Minamoto Yoshikage ventured to the Miho area of Japan. At the Miho Shrine, Yoshikage became a Shinto priest and changed his name to Miyagishima Shichirodayu. For several hundred years thereafter, his descendants worked at the Miho Shrine.

Tournaments and championships Born in Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, as a youth he frequently succeeded in tournaments and climbed rapidly through the junior rankings to participate at the very highest level. At Skien in 1979, he entered the World Junior Championship and finished runner-up to Yasser Seirawan. A short while later (January 1980), he played in the European Junior Championship at Groningen and won the event (ahead of Zurab Azmaiparashvili). These prestigious successes soon led him to an International Master title and more importantly, laid the foundation stones for his continued development over the next few years. There were many tournament victories, either outright or shared, including Irkutsk 1980, Copenhagen 1984 (and 1986 with Vasily Smyslov), Stary Smokovec 1984, Polanica Zdroj (Rubinstein Memorial) 1988 (with Alexander Goldin), Prague 1989 and Marseilles 1990 (with Evgeny Bareev). Also of note were the shared second places achieved at Cienfuegos (Capablanca Memorial) 1981 and Reggio Emilia 1986/7. The pinnacle of his playing career undoubtedly occurred in 1985, when he became a Grandmaster, won the Soviet Championship (jointly with Viktor Gavrikov and Mikhail Gurevich) and scored well in the Gammarth (Tunisia) Interzonal for a place in the Montpellier Candidates Tournament. Unfortunately, his World Championship Candidacy went no further, as he could only manage a mid-table finish. He was however a double gold medal winner in the same year, taking team and individual honours at the inaugural World Team Championship, held in Luzern, where he represented the USSR. At another first time event, the World Blitz Championship held in Saint John 1988, he finished joint third (with Kiril Georgiev, after Mikhail Tal and Rafael Vaganian). Into the 1990s, Chernin was still performing well in international competition; clear first at Dortmund 1990 (ahead of Boris Gelfand), and shared first/second at Dortmund 1991 (Igor Stohl won on tie- break) with further successes to follow at Buenos Aires (Najdorf Memorial) 1992, Gothenburg 1996 and Aubervilliers 1996 (the latter, a rapid event). Chernin relocated to Budapest in 1992 and became a Hungarian national a year later. He has represented his adopted country many times; for instance at the Olympiads of 1994 and 1996, but also at three European Team Chess Championships, the latest being in 1999, when he won a team silver medal. Present activities Into the new millennium, he has played less often, but was joint winner of the 2001 Corsica Masters, losing out to Viswanathan Anand in the final play-off game for the champion's title. He is also involved in coaching, his best known student being the young Italian-American master Fabiano Caruana. In 2004 he was awarded the title of FIDE Senior Trainer. Alexander Chernin is a theorist and has written analytical articles for New In Chess amongst other publications. In the chess openings arena, he is a noted expert on the Pirc Defence and in 2001, co-authored a repertoire book with Lev Alburt, named Pirc Alert!.

The process is essentially modeled after the amendment process for the United States Constitution in that: *A two-thirds supermajority is required for adoption; *Ratification by a supermajority of the respective states is required; *There are two methods of proposing amendments; *The more common of those methods is for the \\"first branch\\" (in the case of the UN, the General Assembly) to submit an amendment to the states; *Another method, not actually used in practice, is to call a convention to propose amendments. *The amendment procedure itself contains a provision that does not allow states (in the case of the UN, the permanent five members of the UN Security Council) to be deprived of their suffrage (in this case, their veto and/or permanent UNSC membership) without their consent. (This is analogous to the entrenched clause contained in Article Five of the United States Constitution). There have been several amendments to the United Nations Charter since 1945, mostly to reflect increases in the size of the organization. However, the fundamental structure has remained the same. Nonetheless, the UN amendment process arguably favors the flexibility and continued existence of the organization more than the League of Nations amendment process specified by Article 26 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which stated, \\"Amendments to this Covenant will take effect when ratified by the Members of the League whose representatives compose the Council and by a majority of the Members of the League whose Representatives compose the Assembly. No such amendment shall bind any Member of the League which signifies its dissent therefrom, but in that case it shall cease to be a Member of the League.\\" References Category:Divisions and sections of the Charter of the United Nations ","title":"Chapter XVIII of the United Nations Charter"},{"id":"13638757","text":"thumb Philipp, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg-Lauchst√§dt (26 October 1657 - 1 July 1690) was a German prince. He was a member of the House of Wettin. He was born in Merseburg, the fifth but third surviving son of Christian I, Duke of Saxe- Merseburg and Christiana of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. Life In order to give his three younger sons a proper land to live, Duke Christian I, before his death assigned to them in each case his own small territories as appanages; however, the allowances of them remained in the Saxe-Merseburg main line and with this, their powers over that lands were strongly limited. Philipp received in 1684 the town of Lauchst√§dt and founded the line of Saxe- Merseburg-Lauchst√§dt. He was allowed to develop and rebuild the castle (which was strongly damaged during the Thirty Years' War) for himself and his family, and later used the castle church as a City parish church (German: Stadtpfarrkirche). In November 1685 the first christening could already take place in the new church in the semifinished nave. Philipp was completely devoted to his military career as an officer in the Imperial army against King Louis XIV of France and was killed in the Battle of Fleurus (1690). He died without surviving male issue, his second and only surviving son having died just one month before him, and predeceased his father. Thereafter, Lauchst√§dt was merged back into the duchy of Saxe-Merseburg. Marriage and issue In Weimar on 9 July 1684 Philipp married firstly with Eleonore Sophie of Saxe- Weimar. They had two children, neither of whom survived to adulthood: #Christiana Ernestina (b. Merseburg, 16 September 1685 - d.

He is famous for his research on snake venom. He was a recipient of the prestigious Redi Award from the International Society on Toxinology (IST), and was also a former president of the society. He was a former dean of the National Taiwan University College of Medicine. After his retirement from researching, he focused on participating in the Taiwan independence movement and many democratic movement. Lee had founded many political organizations such as the \\"100 Action Union\\" (100Ë°åÂãïËÅØÁõü), Foundation of Medical Professionals Alliance in Taiwan. He was also the first chairperson of the Taiwan Independence Party.  Early years  Lee was born in Takao Prefecture (present-day Kaohsiung), Taiwan in 1915. Both of his parents were from Tainan. Lee chose to become a medical doctor after his father and three of his siblings died of malaria and infectious diseases. Lee grew up in Tainan, where he had outstanding grades. After graduating from the Tainan Prefecture Second High School (now the National Tainan First Senior High School), he attended the Taihoku School of Higher Education (Ëá∫ÂåóÈ´òÁ≠âÂ≠∏Ê†°). He entered the medical department of Taihoku Imperial University in 1936, and became one of the first graduates from the department. Lee enjoyed basic medical studies after entering the medical department. He finished his first research paper in his freshman year, which was published in the Taiwanese Medical Magazine (Âè∞ÁÅ£ÈÜ´Â≠∏ÈõúË™å). After graduating in 1940, Lee decided to quit clinical medicine and keep on studying. He became the assistant of Tsungming Tu, who was researching on basic medical studies and, at the time, the only Taiwanese professors in the medical department. He once said, To gain honor for Taiwan, dignity for the Taiwanese, I chose to follow Professor Tu instead of several other Japanese professors. Because I thought Professor Tu was our people, and we should help him.Ê•äÁéâÈΩ°„ÄÅÁæÖÊôÇÊàê 1996  Career and achievements  The first research Lee did after becoming Tsungming Tu's assistant was the \\"Using Kushenji (Ëã¶ËîòÂ≠ê) to cure dysentery.\\" He discovered that the glycosides contained in the Kushenji can be used to kill an amoeba, and solved a Chinese herbological myth on how the Kushenji cures dysentery. In 1945, Lee published a research paper with a title of \\"The Toxicological Research on the Venom of Daboia\\" (ÈéñÈèàËõáËõáÊØíÁöÑÊØíÁâ©Â≠∏Á†îÁ©∂), the paper was world's first paper to explain the cause of death by the venom of Daboia. Because of this outstanding achievement, Lee was recognized by getting his medical doctor degree. This recognition began his career as researching snake venom.ÊùéÁìäÊúà 1995/8 In 1952, Lee was financially supported by the Economic Cooperation Administration (ÁæéÊè¥ÊúÉ) and was sent to the University of Pennsylvania Medical School for further education. This was his first time studying abroad. Lee originally wanted to do research on the circulatory system, but because of the limitation of time, his instructor Carl F. Schmidt suggested that he change his topic to pulmonary circulation. After researching at the University of Pennsylvania, he transferred to Wayne State University in Detroit, where he visited Walter Segeers's lab for two months and published a small-sized research paper. After Lee's return to Taiwan, he started his job as a leader at the pharmacology lab of National Taiwan University due to the dimission of Tsungming Tu. In 1963, Lee worked with Chang Chuan-chung (ÂºµÂÇ≥ÁÇØ), a chemist, and separated the deadly Œ±-type and Œ≤-type bungarotoxins of the venom of Bungarus multicinctus. This was a big step in neuroscience, medical science, and pharmacology.ÊùéÁìäÊúà 1995/9;Á¨¶ÊñáÁæé nd, a Over the years, Lee had published over a hundred research papers. He not only became a leader of pharmacology in Taiwan, but also an international authority in the field of venom snake research. In 1970, he was elected a member of Academia Sinica, the national academy of Taiwan. He became the dean of the National Taiwan University College of Medicine in 1972. Four years later, he was awarded the \\"Redi Prize\\" by the International Society on Toxinology. In 1979, he received an invitation from Springer Science+Business Media to serve as the chief editor for the books Chemistry of Protein Toxins in Snake Venoms and The Action of Snake Venoms on Nerve and Muscle, which established his high position in researching snake venom. In 1985, he chosen to serve as the president of the International Society on Toxinology, and became one of the few Taiwanese scholars to lead an international research organization. Cover of The Story of Snake Venom Research in Taiwan Nobel Prize laureate Yuan T. Lee wrote in the foreword of the book The Story of Snake Venom Research in Taiwan (Âè∞ÁÅ£ËõáÊØíÂÇ≥Â•á) that he once had ask another Nobel Prize laureate Joseph L. Goldstein, \\"In the Taiwanese life science field, whose research is recognized internationally?\\" Without the least hesitation, Goldstein answered, \\"Chen-Yuan Lee is internationally recognized.\\"Â§ßÁ¥ÄÂÖÉ 2001 Lee retired in 1986 from National Taiwan University College of Medicine, and was immediately named a professor emeritus by the university.  Entry into politics  In March 1990, over 300,000 students participated in the Wild Lily student movement for democratic reform. Lee, who was almost eighty years old, accompanied the protesting students. This was his first time participating in a political movement. In 1991, along with several colleagues, Chen-Yuan Lee visited Ying-Yuan Lee and Kuo Pei-hung (ÈÉ≠ÂÄçÂÆè), two Taiwan independence supporters and alumni of the National Taiwan University who were arrested for \\"planning to revolt\\" (È†êÂÇôÂèõ‰∫ÇÁΩ™) and were detained in the Tucheng Detention Center (ÂúüÂüéÁúãÂÆàÊâÄ). Later, he felt that the \\"Regulation for Rebellions\\" (Êá≤Ê≤ªÂèõ‰∫ÇÊ¢ù‰æã) and \\"Criminal Law Article 100\\" (ÂàëÊ≥ïÁ¨¨100Ê¢ù) were impeded the democratic development of Taiwan because they were simply tools to help Kuomintang dominate Taiwan. As a result, he organized the \\"100 Action Union,\\" which stands for the abolishment of \\"Criminal Law Article 100.\\" He, as a member of Academia Sinica, joined a sit-down demonstration, leading the \\"100 Action Union\\" and successfully expressed the Taiwanese people's desire for human rights.

She became patron to Sydney's Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children in 1977. Early life Rhona Olive Harris was the daughter of George Frederick Harris, chairman of the Royal Art Society Cardiff, Wales, and Rosetta Elizabeth Harris (n√©e Lucas). She was the fifth of nine children. Rhona was the aunt of Rolf Harris. Her brother was Cromwell Harris, who immigrated from Cardiff, Wales to Perth, Western Australia. Cromwell was the father of Rolf Harris. She was educated at Sully village school and Allensbank Girls School in Cardiff. At age 14 she was a member of the South West Art Society. The Harris family migrated to Australia in 1920 and settled in Perth before moving to Sydney in 1921. Disliking her given name Rhona, and having been dubbed \\"the Welsh pixie\\" on the boat over to Australia, she became known as \\"Pixie\\". She originally produced her professional work under the name \\"Pixie O. Harris\\"; however, following a printer's error at the Sydney Morning Herald, which printed her name as \\"Pixie O'Harris\\", she permanently used that pseudonym. During the 1950s she completed a series of murals and paintings for the children's wards of several hospitals with her brother Olaf. Some of these were later rediscovered, restored and put on display in 2020. Family On 16 July 1928 she married Bruce Pratt, the son of eminent scholar and important Congregational minister, Frederick Vicary Pratt (1870‚Äì1932) and Agnes Elizabeth Pratt (born 1872), n√©e Waddell. He was also the editor of the Australian Encyclopaedia, and a younger brother of the artist Douglas Pratt. The couple had three daughters. Honours In 1953 Pixie O'Harris was awarded the Queen's Coronation Medal. In 1976 she was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The following year she was awarded the Queen's Silver Jubilee Medal. Works =Written by Pixie O'Harris= * 1983, Was It Yesterday?

It is more often called simply a book club, a term that is also used to describe a book discussion club, which can cause confusion. How book sales clubs work Each member of a book sales club agrees to receive books by mail and pay for them as they are received. This may be done by means of negative option billing, in which the customer receives an announcement of the book, or books, along with a form to notify the seller if the customer does not want the book: if the customer fails to return the form by a specified date, the seller will ship the book and expect the customer to pay for it. Alternatively, the business may operate via a \\"positive option\\", in which the customer is periodically sent a list of books offered, but none is sent until the customer specifically orders them. The offer of a free book, often a large one, is a frequent enticement to membership. The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary for years served this purpose. Some clubs offer new members other (non-book) free gifts, such as book notes or reading lights. Some book sales clubs are \\"continuity\\" clubs, which send members a certain number of books (selected by the club or the member) every month until the membership expires or is cancelled. Harlequin Book Clubs are typical of such clubs. Other book sales clubs are \\"commitment\\" clubs, which require members to order a certain number of books in order to fulfill the membership obligation and cancel the membership. Most Book-of-the-Month Clubs are commitment clubs. Book sales clubs typically sell books at a sizable discount from their list prices. Often, the books sold are editions created specifically for sale by the clubs, and are manufactured more cheaply and less durably than the regular editions. The Book-of-the-Month Club (founded 1926) is an early and well known example of this kind of business. Others include the Science Fiction Book Club, the Mystery Book Club, and the Quality Paperback Book Club, all of which are run by Booksonline / Doubleday Entertainment (a subsidiary of Bookspan). The largest book of the month clubs have millions of members. Time-Life book produced a large number of book series in the book sales club format, including the Time Reading Program. Text publication societies In 19th- century Britain, the term book club was sometimes applied to text publication societies. Like the modern clubs, these were membership organizations whose members would receive publications automatically in return for their subscriptions. The books were usually scholarly editions of old works of historical or literary interest, or of archival records, which had been edited and published specifically (and often exclusively) for distribution to society members. The oldest of these societies was the highly exclusive Roxburghe Club, founded in London in 1812. Although many of the 19th-century societies have ceased to exist, others (including the Roxburghe Club) continue to survive and flourish, and new societies continue to be founded. The modern societies mostly focus on publishing editions of archival records, and are now more usually known as record or records societies.

Arif, was a four-star rank army general in the Pakistan Army, serving as the vice-chief of army staff under President Zia-ul-Haq, who retained the command of the army since 1976. His career in the army was mostly spent in the military intelligence, and served in the government of East Pakistan as its military adviser to its army, briefly fighting in the civil war aided by neighboring India. Upon repatriation to Pakistan in 1973, he continued with his military service in the army and eventually ascended as director-general of military intelligence before assuming the staff appointment at the Army GHQ. Appointed as vice-chief of army staff in 1984, he played crucial role in stabilizing the administration of President Zia-ul-Haq, and was succeeded by General Mirza Aslam Beg as army chief in March 1987. Upon his retirement in 1987, he authored several books on the political and military history of Pakistan, of which Working With Zia: Pakistan's Power Politics is the best known. Biography Khalid Mahmud Arif was born on 29 December 1930 in a Kakazai family in East Punjab, India and immigrated to Pakistan following the partition. He attended Edwardes College in Peshawar and graduated in 1947. After passing the ISSB's examinations, he joined the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul as a cadet and graduated in 1947, where he was selected to do advance training on Infantry tactics in Kohat, North-West Frontier Province. His family permanently moved in Kohat as he gained commissioned into the Armoured Corps. In 1952, he was selected for further military training in the United States and was sent to attend the United States Army Armor School at Fort Knox, where he graduated in specializing in the armoured tactics. He was further educated in Military College of Signals in Rawalpindi where he excelled in intelligence management, and graduated in the staff course degree from the Command and Staff College in Quetta, Balochistan, Pakistan. =War appointments and military adviser in East Pakistan= In 1965, Captain Arif served in the armoured corps along with then-Major Zia-ul-Haq and participated in the second war with India over the disputed Kashmir. Captain Arif commanded an American M48 tank against the Indian Army. After the war, he was sent back to the military intelligence and stationed back in East Pakistan as a military adviser to the East Pakistan Army. In 1967, he greatly aided towards troop redeployment of the Eastern Command in formulating a battle plan, codename: \\"Operation X-Sunderbans-1.\\" The deployment, however, was non combative and it was only designed to form the basis for the operational combat plan. In 1969, he was later posted in GHQ Dhaka as a martial law officer under the government led by Governor Vice- Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan in 1969. During this stint, Major Arif reportedly relied a secretive message in his complied report in regards to the situation in East that ultimately warned off the consequences of the civil war. In March 1971, he witnessed the meeting with President Yahya Khan who decided the launch of the military operations against the rebels in the East should take place. Major Arif took over the situation himself to control the law and order. About this meeting, Major Arif described the meeting as: President Yahya took matters in his hands, thus good bye to civil bureaucracy. In East, he fought and led companies to fight the approaching Indian Army, and was captured by the Indian Army units who held him as war prisoner after the instrument of surrender was signed between Lieutenant-General A.A.K. Niazi and Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora, GOC-in-C of Eastern Command of Indian military in 1971. =Command and staff appointments= His efforts and actions in the liberation war in East that accounted his bravery had earned admiration in Pakistan which led to Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto accepting recommendations to decorate Major Arif with service award, Sitara-e-Basalat. In 1975, he was repatriated to Pakistan from the Wagha and was allowed to resume his military service, being promoted as Lieutenant-Colonel. He testified in the War Enquiry Commission led by Chief Justice Hamoodur Rahman, giving accounts of military intelligence failures took place in East. In 1976, he was promoted as Colonel and Brigadier in 1977, of which, he assumed the command of the 111th Brigade stationed in Islamabad; this command appointment lasted only eight months. The general elections held in 1977 saw the victory of Pakistan Peoples Party led by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, caused the public agitation led by the conservative alliance whose politicians refused to accept the results amid alleged vote rigging. Brig. K. M. Arif ultimately leaked and informed Prime Minister Bhutto of covert coup d'√©tat took place under his appointed-army chief General Zia-ul-Haq, but the latter refused to believe him. Acting upon warnings by Brig. Arif, Bhutto did accept all demands by the conservative alliance but the coup d'√©tat had already took place. After receiving orders from Lieutenant-General F.A. Chishti, GoC-in-C of X Corps, Brigadier Arif rotated the 111th Brigade to take control of the civilian government in support of Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq and Chairman joint chiefs Mohammad Shariff. After the coup d'√©tat was completed, General Zia's promoted Brigadier Arif as Major-General and appointed him as Director- General of Military Intelligence (DGMI). In a views of Lieutenant-General Chishti who noted: \\"General Zia was lucky to have Major-General Arif as his life long confidante. He had experience as a Martial Law Officer during General's Yahya's regime and handled matters efficiently.\\"Shahid Javed Burki. \\"Pakistan: Fifty Years of Nationhood (Westview Publishers, 1999)\\" In 1979, he helped and aided in preparing a national security strategy against the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, after a meeting with President Zia-ul-Haq upon the latter's request. =Vice Chief of Army Staff (1984‚Äì87)= A quintessential staff officer, Major-General Arif's career accelerated and gained reputation as an effective commander in the military intelligence. Major-General Arif served in the military intelligence until 1983 when he promoted as Lieutenant- General and posted in a staff assignment in the Army GHQ. At the Army GHQ, he brought most qualified officers who had worked with him in the past assignments, and built up his reputation in army as an effective leader. On 11 March 1983, Lieutenant-General Arif, alongside with Chairman Senate Ghulam Ishaq Khan, was invited by Munir Ahmad Khan, then-Chairman of PAEC, to witnessed the subcritical testing of an atomic device that took place in a hidden weapons-testing sites. Despite never effectively commanding the field assignments, he was named and appointed as Vice Chief of Army Staff under President Zia in 1984. Upon being promoted to four-star rank army general, he assumed the command of Pakistan Army as its Vice-Chief of Army Staff under President Zia. To many observers, this promotion, in fact, made General Arif the chief of army staff of the Pakistan Army with the entire commanding staff reporting to him. As an army chief, General Arif played a crucial role towards the successful implementation of the secretive atomic bomb programme after removing the civilian administrator, Dr. Mubashir Hassan. Towards diplomacy with the United States, General Arif made frequent trips with United States, successfully convincing the Reagan administration to allow the secretive atomic bomb development by making it very clear to the United States that \\"[Pakistan] won't compromise on its nuclear weapons programme, but won't conduct a test to harm to relationship between two nations.\\" In 1983, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) placed a mole near the Kahuta Research Laboratories but was thwarted by the ISI, which according to General Arif, the ISI took the mole to its secret museum to train its own spies in espionage operations. He was described as a very uptight and strict army officer by civilian scientists, specifically dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan in his memoirs, did not compromise on his morals and disciplines throughout his career. In 1984, General Arif's tenure also saw the commissioning of the Bell AH-1 Cobra Attack helicopters in the aviation corps. In 1986‚Äì87, he deployed and rotated the V Corps, with support from the Southern Air Command to deter the Indian Army's major military exercise that took place near Pakistan's border under supervision of General Sundarji, then-army chief of Indian Army. During this time, he refuted the claims made by dr. A.Q. Khan and immediately issued directives towards the policy of deliberate ambiguity over the clandestine atomic bomb programme. Post retirement In 1987, General Arif sought retirement from his military service and did not seek extension and handed over the army command to Lieutenant-General Mirza Aslam Beg who was promoted to the four-star rank and as an army chief. Upon retiring, he focused towards poetry and became a military historian when he authored the notable eyewitnessed and famed text on the military interference led General Zia-ul- Haq, Working with Zia, published in 1995. In 2001, he published Khaki Shadows: Pakistan 1947‚Äì1997, about the politics, government, and armed forces of Pakistan during and shortly after the Cold War. In 2010, he authored another book, Estranged Neighbours: India, Pakistan (1947-2010) on the foreign relations of India and Pakistan. In 2015, his wife died and he is currently residing in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan. Gen (Retd) K M Arif died on 6th March 2020 in ICU CMH Lahore due to Kidney disease which had taken over since long.

It can loosely be grouped with the stimulant or antidepressant drug families, but its mechanism of action is quite different. BPAP (along with another similar compound PPAP) is classified as a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the impulse propagation mediated transmitter release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. However, unlike stimulant drugs like amphetamine, which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, BPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamine and BPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamine causes neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the synapse regardless of external input, while with BPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released. Other drugs which produce this effect are the endogenous trace amines phenethylamine and tryptamine, and the neuroprotective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline. However, while selegiline is a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor, BPAP is only a weak MAO-A inhibitor at high doses, and at low doses produces only the activity enhancer effect. BPAP has been shown to have neuroprotective effects similar to those of selegiline, and has been researched for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and clinical depression.

He was the sixth (but fourth surviving) son of Christian I, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg and Christiana of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gl√ºcksburg. Life In order to give his three younger sons lands to generate income for their support, Duke Christian I assigned to each of them small territories as appanages before he died. Their administration remained under the control of the Saxe-Merseburg main line, however, and they were only able to exercise limited powers over their territories. In 1694 Heinrich received the town of Spremberg and founded the line of Saxe-Merseburg-Spremberg. Heinrich's rule in Spremberg led to an exceptional period of artistic patronage when he had Schloss Spremberg expanded to serve as his summer residence. Two magnificent three-story wings were built in the east and west connected by a wooden gallery on the courtside whose tower was provided with a tent roof. He also established a pleasure park where he could indulge his love for the hunt. His notorious preference for hunting was later immortalized in a part of Spremberg that is named after him: \\"Heinrichsfeld.\\" The city was rebuilt with Heinrich's support after the big fire of 30 July 1705. For the craftsmen, he bestowed privileges which led to the blossoming of their trade. Heinrich is also regarded as a major patron of the arts. He appointed Johann Theodor Roemhildt in 1726 as his \\"Hofkapellmeister\\" (head of the court musical establishment) a post he also held later in Merseburg. From the sculptor Johann Michael Hoppenhaupt he ordered a Medaillenkabinett on his own design which represents today the single piece of original furniture in the museum in the Schloss Merseburg. The death of his young nephew Frederick Erdmann in 1714 left Heinrich as the next in line to succeed to the duchy of Saxe-Merseburg. After Heinrich's nephew Maurice Wilhelm died without male issue on 21 April 1731, the sixty-nine-year- old Heinrich inherited the duchy. He continued to foster economic and artistic activities on the model of his late nephew. In 1735 he initiated the building of a duke's pavilion in Lauchst√§dt and in 1738 he had built the so-called High Water Art (German: Oberen Wasserkunst), a well-house and commercial house in Merseburg-Oberaltenburg. His sculptor and architect Johann Michael Hoppenhaupt was responsible for the designs. Marriage and issue In G√ºstrow on 29 March 1692 Heinrich married Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow, sister of Hedwig, the wife of Heinrich's brother August, Duke of Saxe-Merseburg-Z√∂rbig. They had three children: #Maurice, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Spremberg (b. Spremberg, 29 October 1694 - d. Spremberg, 11 April 1695). #Christiana Fredericka (b. Spremberg, 17 May 1697 - d. Spremberg, 21 August 1722). #Gustava Magdalena (b. Spremberg, 2 October 1699 - d. Spremberg, 3 October 1699). Without surviving male issue, the line of Saxe-Merseburg became extinct upon his death.

The 16mm short combines traditional animation, pixilation, and stop-motion animation to present a cartoon rabbit careening through a variety of rapidly changing film genres as his animator struggles to come up with a good idea. The short is Hertzfeldt's least favorite of his work, but it nevertheless was an animation festival hit that went on to receive 17 awards. In 1997, it was shown on an episode of MTV's Cartoon Sushi. On DVD In 2005, the original 16mm negative was digitally restored and remastered for the first time, for release on the extensive \\"Bitter Films Volume 1\\" DVD compilation of Hertzfeldt's 1995-2005 films. Special features included for Genre are Hertzfeldt's original production sketches, notes, and deleted ideas from the film; as well as a very rare 1993 video short called \\"Escape is Still Impossible\\": a precursor to Genre that Don created while still in high school. The DVD is available exclusively at the Bitter Films website, http://www.bitterfilms.com Plot The plot centers around a hand drawn rabbit, being told what to do by the animator. (similar to Duck Amuck.) The rabbit's activities depend on what genre appears on the screen. (Example, for \\"horror movie\\", the rabbit is stabbed repeatedly by a similarly-drawn bear.) Occasionally, the animator's hand will appear on the screen (Example, at the start, the rabbit is trying to run away from the movie, only to be pulled back by the animator's hand). List of genres in the short * The Romantic Film - The animator draws up a female rabbit and the male rabbit dresses himself up and presents some flowers to her * The Science Fiction Film - The female rabbit tears off her face to reveal to be an alien-like creature and drags itself offscreen, causing the rabbit's flowers to wilt * The Comedy - The animator holds a carrot and the rabbit tries to get it from the animator's grasp, only for the animator to tease him a few times by shifting its hand away. The rabbit then flips the animator off * The Black Comedy - The animator draws up a carrot for the rabbit, and he eats it, only to find out it is a \\"radioactive ebola carrot\\" and his skin melts off and his eyeballs pop out from their sockets, and the rabbit runs around screaming, then gets hit by three lightning bolts, and hit by a 10-ton weight * The Buddy Picture - The animator draws up a bear and he becomes the rabbit's buddy * The Porno Film - The bear then imagines the rabbit as a girl (The animator draws makeup on the rabbit) and tries to kiss the rabbit, causing him/her to scream * The Horror Film - The rabbit ends up being fine, but is stabbed repetitively and quickly by the bear before stabbing himself * The Children's Film - The animator puts a party hat on the rabbit's head, only for it to do nothing, poking him with his finger only sticks the rabbit's tongue out. The animator pulls out a gun, threatening if he doesn't dance, he will shoot him. The rabbit dances as retro cartoon music plays rapidly changing in pitch * The Religious Film - The camera pans from left to right by The Last Supper by Leonardo Da Vinci, only Jesus's head is replaced by the rabbit * The Abstract Foreign Western - The rabbit is dressed as a cowboy, and text is typed below him that reads \\"I am Cow Boy.

Neighborhoods in Nachlaot (plural of nachala, lit. \\"homestead\\") include Nahalat Shiv'a (built in the 1860s it is the oldest of the group,) Batei Broide, Batei Munkacs, Batei Rand, Knesset Yisrael, Mazkeret Moshe, Mishkenot Yisrael, Nahalat Ahim, Neve Betzalel, Neve Shalom), Ohel Moshe, Shevet Ahim, Sukkat Shalom, Zikhron Tuvya, and Zikhron Yosef. Name Nahala, plural nahlaot (with different ways of transliterating/spelling it), is a Hebrew word for either heritage or estate. History View of Nachlaot from Sacher Park, February 2015 Street of the Stairs, Nahalat Ahim The neighborhoods that make up the Nachlaot district were established beginning in the late 1870s outside the walls of the Old City, which was becoming increasingly overcrowded and unsanitary. The first was Mishkenot Yisrael, built in 1875. The name comes from a biblical verse (): \\"How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob/Thy dwellings, O Israel.\\" Mazkeret Moshe was founded by Sir Moses Montefiore in 1882 as an Ashkenazi neighborhood. Ohel Moshe is a Sephardi neighborhood established alongside it. Former Israeli president Yitzhak Navon grew up in Ohel Moshe, and the neighborhood served as the inspiration for his play Bustan Sephardi (Sephardi Orchard). The Banai family, a famous family of actors and singers, lived in Nachlaot. A Syrian Jewish community settled in Nachlaot in 1900 and built the Ades Synagogue, which was completed in 1901. Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda outdoor market is located next to Nachlaot. Rabbi Aryeh Levin, known as the \\"prisoners' rabbi\\" for his visits to members of the Jewish underground imprisoned in the Russian Compound, lived in Mishkenot Yisrael. Nahalat Ahim, south of Rehov Bezalel, was founded in 1925 for the Yemenite community.Jerusalem Post article Gentrification In the wake of gentrification projects in the area, housing prices have risen steeply. Synagogues Or Zaruaa Synagogue At one time Nachlaot had a higher concentration of synagogues than anywhere else in the world, around 300 within a radius of just a few blocks. Many of these were not much more than a tiny room with space for only about a dozen worshippers. Over the decades, many have closed, and now there are about 100 left, such as Kol Rina, an Orthodox synagogue which offers prayer services modeled after the tunes and spirit of the late Rabbi Carlebach, and the N'vei Shalom (Raz) Synagogue, offering an inspiring Friday night Kabbalat Shabbat service intended to not just fulfill one's responsibility to pray, but to stir the heart and spirit. Rabbi Aaron Leibowitz runs a weekly Friday night service outdoors, at Reshimu. The neighborhood includes the world-famous Ades Synagogue, Ades Congregation, the flagship of the Syrian Halebi community, as well as the synagogues located in the Knesset Aleph (Beis Rachel), Batei Broide, and Batei Rand neighborhoods, following the tradition of Old Jerusalem, including followers of the Vilna Gaon as well as Hasidic tradition. Or Zaruaa Synagogue, founded in 1926 by Rabbi Amram Aburbeh for the Ma'araviim Jewish congregation, also served as a yeshiva for religious students. The building located on 3 Shmuel Refaeli street in Nahalat Ahim neighborhood was declared a historic preservation site in 1989, under cultural heritage protection. Rabbi Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel, the chief rabbi of Erez Israel, appointed Aburbeh as chief rabbi of the Nachlaot neighbourhood from 1924 to 1951. He was succeeded by Rabbi Rahamim Levy, who served as Rav of Nachlaot until 2013. The Romaniote community of Jerusalem holds its religious services in the synagogue Beit Avraham Ve'ohel Sarah liKehilat Ioanina, which is also in Nachlaot.Ioanina's Jews: Remnants of a vibrant Romanioti community, 09/11/15. Retrieved on 22.07.2018 Cultural landmarks The Friends of Zion Museum is located in Nachalat Shiv'a; it is built into a series of the neighborhood's historic stone houses. The Museum entrance is at #20 Yosef Rivlin Street, the house that was the home of neighborhood founder Yosef Rivlin, great-grandfather of Israeli President Reuven Rivlin. The Gerard Behar Center, formerly known as Beit Ha'Am, opened in 1961. It was the venue for the 1961 trial of Adolf Eichmann and was renovated in 1983 as an arts centre.

Archibald Alexander. Early life Alexander was born in 1804 in Louisa County, Virginia, the eldest son of Rev. Archibald Alexander and his wife Janetta Waddel. He was born on the Hopewell estate near present-day Gordonsville at the residence of his maternal grandfather after whom he was named, the blind Presbyterian preacher James Waddel. His younger brothers included William Cowper Alexander (1806-1874), president of the New Jersey State Senate and first president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, and Joseph Addison Alexander (1809-1860), a biblical scholar. At the time of Alexander's birth, his father was president of Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia. He attended his first schools in Philadelphia after his father was called to serve as minister of the Third Presbyterian Church in 1807. The family then moved to Princeton, New Jersey when Archibald Alexander was named the first professor of the Princeton Theological Seminary in 1812. Alexander entered the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1817 and graduated in 1820. In 1824, he helped to create the Chi Phi Society, a semi- religious, semi-literary organization, which ceased activity the following year when it merged with the Philadelphian Society. Career After graduation, Alexander studied theology at the Princeton Seminary. In 1824 he was appointed a tutor, and during the same year he was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of New Brunswick, New Jersey. He was pastor of a Presbyterian church in Charlotte County, Virginia from 1826 to 1828, and of the First Presbyterian Church of Trenton, New Jersey from 1829 to 1832. In 1833, he was appointed Professor of Rhetoric and Belles-Letters in the College of New Jersey. He served in this position until 1844, when he became pastor of New York City's Duane Street Presbyterian Church. He served as professor of ecclesiastical history and church government at Princeton Theological Seminary from 1849 to 1851. He then returned to the New York church, which in its new location was known as the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church. He served as minister there until his death. Alexander became a patron of Henry Baldwin Hyde, who founded the Equitable Life Assurance Society in 1859. Many of the company's original directors were members of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church recruited by Alexander. Alexander's brother, William Cowper Alexander, was named the first president of the company. His son, James Waddell Alexander, would also later serve as president of the company, while another son, William C. Alexander, served as company secretary. Personal life On June 18, 1830, Alexander married Elizabeth Clarentine Cabell (1809-1885), daughter of George Cabell and Susannah Wyatt. Her paternal great-grandfather, William Cabell (1699-1774), was the patriarch of the prestigious Cabell family of Virginia. They had seven children: * George Cabell Alexander (1831-1839) * Archibald Alexander (1832-1834) * Henry Carrington Alexander (1835-1894), author of The Life of Joseph Addison Alexander (1870) * James Waddell Alexander (1839-1915), president of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, 1899-1905; father-in-law of portrait painter John White Alexander and grandfather of mathematician James Waddell Alexander II * John Alexander (1845-1847) * William C. Alexander (1848-1937), cofounder of Pi Kappa Alpha and secretary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society * Janetta Alexander (1850-1851) Alexander died of dysentery at the Red Sweet Springs in Alleghany County, Virginia in 1859 at the age of 55. He had visited the springs due to his feeble health. He was buried in the family plot at Princeton Cemetery. Published works His published works include his sermons and a book on the life of his father. Alexander's English translation of the hymn \\"O Sacred Head, Now Wounded,\\" became the most widely used version in 19th and 20th century hymnals. His books, and many juvenile books for Sunday-school libraries, include: * A Gift to the Afflicted (1835) * The American Mechanic and Workingman (2 vols., 1847, a collection of papers to mechanics first printed under the pseudonym of \\"Charles Quill\\") * Thoughts on Family Worship (1847) * Sacramental Addresses (1854) * The Revival and its Lessons (1859) * Thoughts on Preaching (1861) * Faith (1862) His correspondence is collected in Forty Years' Familiar Letters of James W.

He initially trained and qualified on helicopters, before transferring to Fighter aircraft in 16 Squadron with the Panavia Tornado. His service included Northern Ireland and Hong Kong. Mason was among the 24 RAF Tornado crews detached to Saudi Arabia during the build-up to Operation Desert Storm, with the specific brief of knocking out Iraqi Air Force bases by bombing the runways. On Mason's first mission, an ultra-low-level daylight mission on Ar Rumaylah Southwest Air Base leading a flight of four Tornados, his number two crew of John Peters and navigator John Nichol were shot down and became POWs. Mason led a total of 24 bombing sorties in Desert Storm, from ultra-low-level daylight, medium-level night bombing and, on 2 February 1991, the first-ever combined Buccaneer and Tornado attack using laser-guided bombs. During the Gulf War he was often seen on television representing the RAF. Following his return from the Gulf, Mason's life was saved on 10 May 1991 when his navigator ejected the crew from his Tornado GR1, which crashed near Lubberstedt, Germany, on a training mission. The RAF investigation of the incident attributed the cause of the crash to pilot mishandling of the aircraft. After the Gulf War, he remained in the public eye, particularly during the 1998/9 bombing of Iraq, which he publicly criticised;.The People, 20 December 1998, Operation Desert Fox: My Heart Is With Brave Top Gun Heroes.(News)Birmingham Post, 1 February 1999, Gulf hero slams Blair over raids After the RAF After retirement from the RAF, Mason returned to his home in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire where he wrote his book Pablo's War. He and his wife run the Adams Hotel. While Mason flew as a senior pilot for MyTravel Airways, the charter airline division of the holiday company MyTravel Group plc, he flew both holiday makers and private charters. Mason was well- known within the airline for his humorous, matter-of-fact style, telling a \\"rather miserable\\" bunch of holiday makers who made up the last flight of the 1997 season from Manchester Airport to the Greek island of Kefalonia, \\"Come on you miserable lot.

MyTravel considered that Mason had broken these rules and endangered the safety of the flight.

A letter of Pope Martin V in 1429 claimed that he was \\"of a great noble race by both parents\\".Dowden, Bishops, p. 219. Robert Keith believed that he had the surname \\"Urquhart\\", but that is not supported by the contemporary evidence and is probably spurious.Dowden, Bishops, p. 219; Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 189. Pre-episcopal career In November 1429, he was given the parish church of Longforgan, in Gowrie, in the diocese of St Andrews, to be held in \\"perpetual vicarage\\"; he was to hold this along with the Caithness archdeaconry and the prebend of Croy in the diocese of Moray. He had exchanged with Thomas de Greenlaw to become Archdeacon of Caithness a year before, and received papal provision on 12 March 1428, though it is not clear that he ever took possession; he resigned the position in exchange for parochial benefices on 15 July 1437, namely the parish of Tannadice, diocese of St Andrews.Dowden, Bishops, p. 219; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 71. In the same year (1437), Tulloch won his litigation against John de Innes for the position of Dean of Ross; after the death of William Fayrhar, probably in earlier in 1436, Tulloch received provision while Innes was collated to the position locally.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 272. However, Laurence Piot had also received provision for the position, and Tulloch likewise was involved against Piot in litigation; Tulloch retained possession of the deanery until resigning his right to James de Innes on 23 September 1440, three days before he was provided to the bishopric of Ross.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 268, 272. On that same day, i.e. on 23 September, he was provided as Subdean of Dunkeld, but resigned later in the day.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 116. Bishop of Ross Tulloch received provision to the Ross bishopric on 26 September from Pope Eugenius IV at the papal court, and on 14 October, he paid the papacy 600 gold florins; by the time of this payment, he had already received consecration.Dowden, Bishops, p. 218; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 268. On 10 February 1441 a safe-conduct was issued to Thomas Tulloch, at that time in Flanders, on his way back to Scotland from the papal court. The postulation to the bishopric of Andrew Munro, Archdeacon of Ross, by the cathedral chapter of Fortrose was rejected by Pope Eugenius IV. He was in Scotland in May 1443.Dowden, Bishops, p. 218. He was witness to a royal charter on 24 January 1450. He attended the Edinburgh parliament of 24 September 1451. On 17 June 1455, Bishop Thomas, along with the other bishops of Scotland, sealed the forfeiture of James Douglas, 9th Earl of Douglas. In the 18th century, Bishop Tulloch's name was apparently on an inscription, dated to 1460.Keith, Historical Catalogue, p. 569.

The picture is an unofficial sequel to Sam Peckinpah's Cross of Iron, and includes several characters from that film. The film starred several big names including Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum and Rod Steiger. Burton (Sergeant Steiner) and Helmut Griem (Major Stransky) assume the roles played by James Coburn and Maximilian Schell respectively in the original film. The supporting cast features Michael Parks and Curd J√ºrgens. Klaus L√∂witsch is the only actor from Cross of Iron to reprise his role. Plot Starting in late May 1944, during the German retreat on the Eastern Front, Captain Stransky (Helmut Griem) orders Sergeant Steiner (Richard Burton) to blow up a railway tunnel to prevent Russian forces from using it. Steiner's platoon fails in its mission by coming up against a Russian tank. Steiner then takes a furlough to Paris just as the Allies launch their invasion of Normandy. Steiner's unit is transferred to France, occupying the village of St. Bologne. General Hoffman (Curd J√ºrgens) orders Steiner to cross into enemy territory and confer with American Colonel Rogers (Robert Mitchum) and General Webster (Rod Steiger) that the High Command of the German Army (Wehrmacht) is plotting to assassinate Hitler and would like to surrender. The plan fails and American forces launch an attack on German forces in St. Bologne where Stransky has planned an explosion to destroy both the Americans and the civilian inhabitants. Cast *Richard Burton as Sergeant Rolf Steiner *Robert Mitchum as Colonel Rogers *Rod Steiger as General Webster *Michael Parks as Sergeant Anderson *Curd J√ºrgens as General Hoffmann *Helmut Griem as Major von Stransky *Klaus L√∂witsch as Corporal Kr√ºger *Christoph Waltz as Paramedic Unofficial sequel reception and criticism The film Breakthrough which was mostly financed by West German producers when it was released in 1979, after several changes were made to the sequel for instance the action was moved from Russia to the Western Front and Richard Burton replaced Coburn as Sgt Steiner. Breakthrough was panned by critics, who criticised it for a confusing plot, poor dialogue, aged cast and undistinguished acting. Critics state that this movie is not 100% percent canon to Cross of Iron because it does not follow the correct timelines nor makes any sense since Stransky was already wounded and left for dead and Steiner goes missing in action in the previous film. Also, the film depicts the duties of officers being performed by enlisted men and the duties of enlisted men being performed by officers.

Herrera is the son of writer and two-term U.S. Poet Laureate Juan Felipe Herrera. Life and career From 2006 to 2016, Herrera maintained and published The Unapologetic Mexican blog, under the pseudonym Nezua.FAIR.org, Latinos in New Media/ The blog focused on Latino, ethnicity/race, and immigration issues through a Mexican American lens. During its run, The Unapologetic Mexican gained widespread notoriety and many accolades, such as Jos√© Merino of Mexico's El Centro newspaper calling Herrera \\"a brilliant and incisive writer,\\" and journalist Glenn Greenwald declaring that Herrera's site \\"provides some of the most passionate, insightful, and provocative commentary on race, ethnicity, immigration and politics that can be found online.\\" Due to the exposure gained by writing at The Unapologetic Mexican, Herrera was chosen to participate in events like Politicshome.com's \\"first-ever survey of the top 100 online voices and bloggers tracking trends and attitudes heading toward the 2008 Election Day\\" in guessing the outcome of the presidential election polls in all 20 battleground states. (Herrera successfully called 19 of 20 states, beating out Rob Schlesinger of U.S. News & World Report, James Forsyth of The Spectator, and Chuck Todd of First Read, NBC.) Many other opportunities arose from Herrera's public writing, including being chosen as a panelist for The French-American Foundation‚Äôs international symposium on immigration in media: Ethnic Media in North America and Europe: A Comparative Approach, in Miami (November, 2009), and a speaker at Kirwan Institute‚Äòs March 2010 event Transforming Race: Crisis and Opportunity in the age of Obama. Herrera was often sponsored to fly to such events to either speak on his style of blogging or to cover Latino or immigration-related topics. One high profile event was in 2008, when Herrera was sponsored by Kenneth Cole Productions and CultureKitchen.net to attend the Democratic and Republican National Conventions as an officially credentialed blogger. Joaqu√≠n Ram√≥n Herrera was also the writer, anchor, producer, and sole creative force behind News With Nezua (2008 - 2016), a webisode eventually sponsored by different organizations throughout its tenure, including La Frontera Times, Reform Immigration for America, and Center for a New Community. News With Nezua was a valued voice in the online immigration, race, and Chicano dialogues, and many immigration-centric and Latino sites and blogs republished the episodes regularly.  Honors  * As one of the founding editors of the immigration group blog The Sanctuary, Herrera accepted the 2009 New America Media award for Best Blogger on Ethnic Perspectives on behalf of the group, in Atlanta.

Fringe theories include the models and proposals of fringe science, as well as similar ideas in other areas of scholarship, such as the humanities. The term fringe theory is commonly used in a narrower sense as a pejorative, roughly synonymous with pseudo-scholarship. Precise definitions that distinguish between widely held viewpoints, fringe theories, and pseudo-scholarship are difficult to construct because of the demarcation problem. Issues of false balance or false equivalence can occur when fringe theories are presented as being equal to widely accepted theories. Definitions Part of the periodic table, according to Jim Carter's fringe theory Fringe theories are ideas which depart significantly from a prevailing or mainstream theory. A fringe theory is neither a majority opinion nor that of a respected minority. In general, the term fringe theory is closer to the popular understanding of the word theory‚Äîa hypothesis or a guess or an uncertain idea‚Äîthan to the concept of an established scientific theory. Although often used in the context of fringe science, fringe theories have been discussed in fields of scholarship, such as Biblical criticism, history, finance, law, medicine, and politics. They even exist in fields of study which are themselves outside the mainstream, such as cryptozoology and parapsychology. Fringe theories meet with varying levels of academic acceptance. Financial journalist Alexander Davidson characterized fringe theories as \\"peddled by a small band of staunch supporters,\\" but not necessarily without merit. Daniel N. Robinson described them as occupying \\"a limbo between the decisive dead end and the ultimately credible productive theory.\\" However, the term is also used pejoratively; advocates of fringe theories are dismissed as cranks or crackpots who are out of touch with reality. In this sense, there is some overlap with other dismissive labels, such as pseudoarchaeology, pseudohistory, and pseudoscience. Describing ideas as fringe theories may be less pejorative than describing them as pseudoscholarship; while it is unlikely that anyone would identify their own work as pseudoscience, astrologer David Cochrane is \\"proud to be a fringe theorist.\\" The term is also used to describe conspiracy theories. Such theories \\"explain\\" historical or political events as the work of a powerful secret organization ‚Äî \\"a vast, insidious, preternaturally effective international conspiratorial network,\\" according to Richard Hofstadter. The conspirators are possessed of \\"almost superhuman power and cunning,\\" as described by historian Esther Webman. Margaret Wertheim suggested that fringe theories should be treated in a manner similar to outsider art. In 2003 she curated an exhibit at the Santa Monica Museum of Art which was dedicated to the work of fringe physicist Jim Carter. =Demarcation problem= Wertheim wrote that a \\"credentialed physicist ... can generally recognize a fringe theory by sight\\" when it comes in the form of an eccentrically formatted manuscript. However, it is difficult to distinguish between fringe theories and respected minority theories. A workable definition of what constitutes a fringe theory may not actually be possible. This is an aspect of the demarcation problem that occurs within both science and the humanities. Geologist Steven Dutch approached the demarcation problem by dividing scientific ideas into three categories: fringe, frontier, and center, based upon their adherence to scientific methodology and their level of acceptance. Later authors, including Richard Duschl, expanded these categories. Under Duschl's system, a fringe theory is a mix of legitimate new ideas and pseudoscience; it awaits analysis to determine whether it will pass into the \\"frontier\\" or be rejected entirely. Mainstream impact Alfred Wegener advanced the theory of continental drift, a fringe theory which was later adopted by mainstream science Most fringe theories never become part of established scholarship. Rejected ideas may help to refine mainstream thought, but most outside theories are simply incorrect and have no wider impact. Nevertheless, some ideas gradually receive wider acceptance until they are no longer viewed as fringe theories, and occasionally, such theories even become the mainstream view. A widely known example is Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, which eventually served as the basis for the accepted model of plate tectonics. Other ideas that have made the transition include the germ theory of disease, Birkeland's explanation of the aurora, prions, and complexity theory in project management. Behavioral finance was described in a 2002 journal article as \\"at the fringe of ... modern financial theory\\", but it has since been widely applied in many fields of business. Sometimes, the change is not gradual but represents a paradigm shift. Writing for the New York Law Journal, Andrew Bluestone described how a single court case in New York changed the use of an obscure common law statute regarding attorney misconduct from a \\"fringe theory of law\\" to an accepted, mainstream cause for legal action in the state. Similarly, former mainstream theories such as phlogiston and luminiferous aether may be superseded and relegated to the fringe. Such shifts between fringe theory and accepted theories are not always clear-cut. In 1963, Reuben Fine wrote that mainstream psychology had adopted aspects of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis but that many students of the discipline believed psychoanalysis to be a \\"lunatic fringe theory which has little to do with scientific psychology,\\" and psychoanalysis is now generally considered discredited, according to author Frederick Crews who stated, \\"if you consult psychology faculties in top American universities, you will find almost no one now who believes in the Freudian system of thought. As a research paradigm it‚Äôs pretty much dead.\\" False balance The news media may play a role in the dissemination and popularization of fringe theories. The media sometimes reduce complex topics to two sides and frame issues in terms of an underdog challenger fighting the mainstream theory. Biblical scholar Matthew Collins wrote that this simplification can be \\"both misrepresentative and misleading, especially when a far-fetched fringe theory is, in the name of neutrality and fairness, elevated to the role of equally legitimate contender.\\" This false equivalence can become the expected media behavior. When The New York Times published an article strongly supporting the mainstream scientific stance on thiomersal and vaccines, others in the media condemned the Times for portraying the alleged vaccine-autism connection as a fringe theory, calling the article a \\"hit piece\\". Issues of false balance also arise in education, especially in the context of the creation‚Äìevolution controversy. Creationism has been discredited as a fringe theory akin to Lamarckism or the cosmology of Immanuel Velikovsky's Worlds in Collision. Because advocates of creationism want schools to present only their preferred alternative, not the entire variety of minority views, they have attempted to portray scholarship on the issue as being equally divided between only two models.

Early life  Yousif Kuwa was born in 1945 at Jebel Miri, a locality in the Nuba Mountains of Central Sudan. A member of the Miri sub-tribe, he was named Kuwa after his father and Mekki after his grandfather. As with most rural Sudanese, his exact birthday is not recorded. Kuwa‚Äôs father was a soldier, and the family moved around the country, resulting in Kuwa growing up with little knowledge of his ethnic Nuba heritage.  Early Political Activism  Kuwa was raised a Muslim, and actually grew up believing he was an Arab. Although a brilliant student, Kuwa's Arab secondary school headmaster made a comment that changed the course of his life, saying, while justifying the unnecessity of education for Nuba children: \\"What is the use of teaching Nuba, who are going to work as servants in houses?\\" This racist comment made Kuwa aware of his identity as a marginalized Nuba,John Ryle, John Ryle Et Al, \\"The Sudan Handbook,\\" Boydell & Brewer Ltd. (2011), p.38 and inspired revolutionary ideas in him when he later studied political science at Khartoum University. At the University, Kuwa was strongly influenced by the ideas of Tanzania's first president Julius Nyerere, the African history of Sudan and about the Nuba cultures. Together with other Nuba students he formed ‚ÄúKomolo‚Äù, a Youth movement to strengthen cultural and political awareness among the Nuba, in 1975. He then found work as a teacher after graduation, teaching in Darfur and in the Nuba Mountains, before being elected to the Southern Kordofan regional assembly in 1981. Working amongst his people, Kuwa began to understand the real nature of the conflict in Sudan. Although a country with a multi-racial, multi-religious and multi-language society, he judged that the politics of Sudan upheld a dichotomy between marginalized and the privileged. Branded a firebrand by the Khartoum government and unable to agitate for the rights of the suppressed Nuba people as a democratically elected representative, Kuwa joined the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLM/A) insurgency led by Dr. John Garang after reading the SPLA manifesto in 1984, as Sudan slipped into civil war.  SPLA Commander and Nuba Leader  Between 1985 and 1986, Kuwa was sent for military training in Ethiopia. He was then appointed to join the SPLM/SPLA Political- Military High Command, and was sent to Cuba for advanced political and military training. Upon return, he became a commander in the SPLA, 10th in rank after John Garang, Kerubino Kuanyin Bol, William Nyuon Bany, Salva Kiir, Arok Thon Arok, Nyaciluk Nyachigak, John Kulang, Riek Machar and Lam Akol. Others in the SPLA High Command included James Wani Igga, Daniel Awet Akot, and Kuol Manyang Juuk. When the SPLA-Nasir split from the SPLA in 1991, Kuwa rose in rank because he was one of those who stood with Garang's dominant faction. Kuwa returned to Sudan in 1987, and was assigned, with a battalion of about 1,000 SPLA guerilla fighters, to penetrate the Nuba Mountains. Under Kuwa‚Äôs command, the SPLA forces overran most of the Nuba Mountains in 1989. The locals received him enthusiastically as he traversed the region, explaining the SPLA‚Äôs cause and asking for their co-operation. Soldiers abusing civilians risked the firing squad, and in 1990, Kuwa, now the SPLA- appointed governor of the Nuba Mountains, introduced self-government, where the Nuba elected their village leaders, district representatives and county administrators. Kuwa became very popular among the Nuba, who did not fear him, but revered him for his charisma and wisdom. Unable to defeat the SPLA in direct confrontations, the Khartoum military directed its violence against the civilian population and sealed off the Nuba Mountains. For 16 years, the Nuba suffered relentless attacks from government forces. Warplanes bombed the area sporadically, hundreds of villages were shelled or burned, thousands were killed and tens of thousands subjected to famine. Faced with the despair of the Nuba people, Kuwa in 1992 convened an Advisory Council forum, asking the representatives to choose whether to continue with the liberation war or surrender to the government. After two days of heated debates the Council voted to carry on with the armed struggle. In 1994, Kuwa's political star within the SPLM/A rose when he organized and chaired a National Liberation Council of the rebel movement, which voted to establish civil administrations, similar to the one he had introduced in the Nuba Mountains, throughout the areas under the SPLA‚Äôs control. The isolation of the Nuba continued to be one of Kuwa‚Äôs main concerns, and he struggled to bring United Nations humanitarian aid to the Nuba people. In 1994 the first plane landed clandestinely in the SPLA controlled part of to the Nuba Mountains. Journalists and human rights activists started to reveal the atrocities committed against the Nuba population. Meanwhile, Kuwa helped form the Nuba Relief, Rehabilitation and Development Organization (NRRDO), a Nuba humanitarian organization. Several international NGOs agreed to support it, but the amount of relief the NRRDO managed to mobilize never matched the enormous needs of the Nuba.  Death  Yousif Kuwa was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1998 and died on 31 March 2001 while undergoing treatment in Norwich, England. He died before witnessing the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement that finally ended the South Sudan conflict. Although the SPLM/A was predominantly Christian, Kuwa remained a Muslim all his life. The Yousif Kuwa Teachers Training Institute (YKTTI), which was established in the Nuba Mountains with the support of the Koinonia Community, is named after him. Yousif Kuwa was survived by his wives Fatuma, Hannan and Ummasar.  The famous poem he wrote while studying at the University of Khartoum  My Africaness, Brothers, With Thousands of my apologies forgive me! Forgive me for frankness and my courage! Let me tell you, Despite all the talk about my Arabism, my religion, and my culture. I am Nuba. I am black. I am an African. Africaness is my identity, It is entrenched in my appearance, It is engraved in my lips and manifested in my skin. My africaness is in the sound of my footsteps, it is my bewildered past and in the depths of my laughter. Brothers, with Thousands of my apologies forgive me! forgive me for my frankness and courage! Despite my grandfather's humiliation, Despite my grandmother's sale into slavery. Despite my ignorance, my backwardness and my naivety. My tomorrow will come. I will crown your dignity with knowledge. I shall light my candle. In its light I Shall build my civilization. At that time I shall extend my hand. I shall forgive Those Who tried to destroy my identity, because love and peace is my aspirations.

Mas√≥ was born in Girona into a refined, conservative, Catholic family of Catalanist ideology. The personality and professional career of the future architect were marked by the cultured atmosphere of his home, created by his father‚Äôs literary and artistic interests, as well as his own love of Girona city and its traditions. Mas√≥ was an admirer of Antoni Gaud√≠ but, as a student in Barcelona, he joined the group of artists and writers who were to forge Noucentisme, the movement that developed as an alternative to Modernisme. The civic spirit, the Catalanist outlook, and the forward-looking, pro-European ideas prevailing within the new movement inspired the young Mas√≥, who was also to become a distinguished poet, urban planner, politician, and promoter of art and literature.ARAG√ì, Narc√≠s- jordi, FALG√ÄS, Jordi i GIL, Rosa Maria. Casa Mas√≥: Noucentista Life and Architecture. Girona-Sant Llu√≠s, Foundation Rafael Mas√≥ - Triangle Postals. 2012 Biography and works Rafael Mas√≥ lived in the Mas√≥ House until 1912, the year of his marriage to Esperan√ßa Bru.ARAG√ì, Narc√≠s-Jordi Rafael Mas√≥, ciutad√† de Girona, Girona, 2006 The bulk of his work was carried out in Girona, and his buildings are mainly in the city and the surrounding area. He designed houses, villas and apartment blocks, as well as many other types of buildings, ranging from schools and hospitals to shops and factories. He was also involved in renovating farmhouses and restoring medieval architecture. His most outstanding works include the Teixidor Flour Mill (1910), the Mas√≥ House (1911), and the Athenea cultural centre (1912), all in Girona; the Masramon House (1913) in Olot, the Casas House (1914) in Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, and S‚ÄôAgar√≥ garden city (1923). Unfortunately, some of Mas√≥‚Äôs plans never left the drawing board, as the clients did not always agree with his proposals. Moreover, after his death, certain buildings were either demolished or irreparably altered. Rafael Mas√≥‚Äôs work is characterized by his identification with the noucentista postulates of a modernity that did not forsake the austerity of classicism, and included forms, colors, and materials taken from the local culture, with much reliance on artisan techniques. Strongly influenced by the English Arts & Crafts movement and by the new German regionalist architecture, Mas√≥ wished to unite the tradition of vernacular architecture with new ideas on structure, ornamentation, interior decoration, and furniture design. His contribution was decisive for the introduction into Catalonia of modern concepts in housing, the updating of traditional craftsmanship, the conservation of the Catalan historic heritage, and the promotion of cultural activity.

Chicago Born in Scotland, McLean immigrated to the United States when he was nineteen. He settled in Chicago where he joined Pullman F.C. which had dominated the Chicago Leagues and Peel Cup. At some point, he moved to the Canadians and finally to Bricklayers and Masons F.C.. In 1928, the Bricklayers lost the National Challenge Cup to the New York Nationals. McLean and the Bricklayers lost a second Challenge Cup in 1931 when Fall River Marksmen took them two games to one in the championship series. St. Louis In 1932, McLean moved to St. Louis where he signed with Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. of the St. Louis Soccer League. The team went to the 1932 Challenge Cup final, but lost to the New Bedford Whalers. In 1933 and 1934, McLean would finally achieve success in the Challenge Cup when Stix, Baer and Fuller won two consecutive Challenge Cup titles, to go with two St. Louis Soccer League titles. Following their 1934 Challenge Cup victory, the team came under the sponsorship of Central Breweries. St. Louis Central Breweries F.C. continued the success they had experienced under the old name by winning a third Challenge Cup and league title in 1935, giving McLean three \\"doubles\\" in three years. The team went through another name change in 1935, this time to St. Louis Shamrocks. In 1936, McLean collapsed during a league game. In 1937, after spending nine months in a sanitarium, he moved back to Chicago. National team In 1930, McLean attended two of the three trial games used to select the roster for the 1930 FIFA World Cup team. He was not selected. In 1934, McLean made the U.S. national team for the 1934 FIFA World Cup. McLean gained his first cap when the U.S. defeated Mexico, 4‚Äì2, in a World Cup qualifier. The U.S. then lost to Italy in the first round of the World Cup. While recovering from his 1936 collapse, McLean was called up to the national team for a three-game series with Mexico in 1937, but did not play. Mysterious disappearance After returning to Chicago in 1937, McLean seemed to have kept a low profile. In the summer of 1938, he disappeared, never to be seen again. His family continued to receive infrequent Mother's Day cards from various towns along the Mississippi River for several years after his disappearance. Finally, in November 1944 Aetna Life Insurance placed an advertisement in the Midwest Soccer News asking for information regarding his whereabouts. Despite these efforts, he was never seen again.

In 1971, in an effort to loosen the hegemony the Big Three television networks had on television in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission implemented two rules, the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules (fin-syn), which prohibited the networks from owning interests in syndicators; and the Prime Time Access Rule, which prohibited networks from programming a one-hour slot in the evening hour, the slot now known as fringe time. The intent of the new rules was to encourage individual station licensees to produce more local programming. In practice, this failed, and the slot was (and largely remains) dominated by syndicated programming. Game shows already airing in daytime on the Big Three networks quickly filled many of the new slots, ostensibly funneled through syndicators but produced on the same sets with most of the same personnel (except sometimes a different host) as their network counterparts, defeating much of the purpose of the new rule. One such program, Wheel of Fortune, has survived in syndication since that era, outlasting the show's network run. Sister program Jeopardy!, after a failed attempt at syndication in 1974 near the end of its network run, returned as an independent show a decade later, with both it and Wheel being fringe time fixtures in the decades since. Although during the early days of these new rules, local stations typically carried a hodge-podge of weekly shows, by the 1980s almost all fringe time programming was strip programming at least five and sometimes six days a week, a pattern that remains to the present day. Other formats that filled fringe time over the years include newsmagazine (mostly syndicated entertainment-based programs), music-based shows (such as Hee Haw, Solid Gold, America's Top 10, and Dance Fever), and off-network rerun, usually sitcom. Local news, occasionally seen in the time slot in the early years of television, has seen a renaissance in the time slot in the 21st century. Occasionally other formats more commonly seen in daytime television such as talk show or court show are used to program the slot, but because it leads into the network prime time lineups, these shows are expected to be highly rated and retain a large audience, and thus only the highest- rated shows in these general (such as Judge Judy) are ever used in this manner. Both fin-syn and the Prime Time Access Rule have since been repealed; the networks, although they have reacquired most of the syndicators they were forced to spin off, have never resumed directly programming the fringe time slots they were forced to abandon. Independent station and non-Big Three network affiliates, because they lack access to network late-night shows, have had to program both the early fringe and the late fringe with similar approaches.

He also plays bass guitar in the rock band Quayleaf . Biography Damian McDonald was born in Canberra and raised by his single mother until she married his stepfather when McDonald was five. His one sibling, a sister, was born in 1974. McDonald's stepfather was an alcoholic and abusive, and McDonald and his sister endured years of poverty and violence. This experience would be a theme portrayed in McDonald's writing. In late primary school and early high school McDonald discovered rock music such as Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Iron Maiden, and Sex Pistols. McDonald bought a guitar and began jamming with like-minded friends and found an outlet for the frustration he was experiencing in his unhappy home life. However, because of his passion for music, McDonald didn't fit in with the mainstream students, and subsequently took out his frustrations on other pupils, mirroring his father's behaviour as he became a school bully, recruiting friends to beat up weaker kids. No doubt he would feel deep shame and remorse in later life, thinking about the violence he dished out to others. In 1986, at age 16, McDonald left school and home, and moved to Sydney, where a musician friend had moved several months earlier. His plan was to become a professional rock musician. Years of toiling in factories and warehouses while rehearsing and playing gigs with Sydney hard rock bands such as Warspite, Detriment and Money Tree Seeds began to take a toll on McDonald, who was seeing his dream of becoming a successful musician eaten away by a lack of support, overindulgence in drugs and alcohol and destructive relationships. In 1996 he made the decision to give music a break for a while. But despairing at the thought of becoming a full-time permanent factory worker led him back to school. McDonald began a Bachelor of Arts in Communication at the University of Canberra after quitting work and returning to the ACT. Without a job, McDonald found accommodation in Canberra's notorious (now demolished) Burnie Court ACT Housing Trust estate. There McDonald met many of the characters that would feature in his work. Growing frustrated with Canberra, McDonald moved back to Sydney and completed a Bachelor of Arts with a double major in English Literature at the University of Western Sydney. Having discovered a passion for reading and writing literature. McDonald then completed a Master of Arts in Creative Writing at the University of Western Sydney, topping his year. McDonald now lives in Sydney, works as a curator at the Powerhouse Museum, writes for and plays bass in his band Quayleaf , and writes literature. He has one daughter. Fiction McDonald's first novel Luck in the Greater West was published in October 2007 after winning the 2007 ABC Fiction Award . Luck in the Greater West is a dissection of the lives of a diverse range of people living in twenty-first-century Western Sydney. Through well developed characterisation and strongly evoked setting, the manuscript is a realism piece that explores the themes of multiculturalism, unemployment, employment, drug use and abuse, racism, rape, relationships, sexuality, love, and the diverse socioeconomic milieu of the western suburbs of Sydney. Most fiction novels about Western Sydney don't get much past the inner-west, dealing with a more fashionable grunge/bohemian existence. Luck in the Greater West, however, deals with that vast accumulation of lives that go virtually voiceless as far as literature is concerned. For the audiobook version of Luck in the Greater West, read by actor Damon Herriman, McDonald composed and performed all the musical cuts. The novel received good critical review; however, controversy has surrounded aspects of the novel that are quite obviously inspired by the infamous Mohammed Skaf gang rape case in Sydney in which male youths of Middle Eastern backgrounds assaulted and gang raped several young Anglo women in Sydney's south-west in 2000. The central character of the novel is Patrick White; he is in his early twenties, unemployed, he sells drugs to friends, and lets life tow him along with little questioning. He is intelligent, although a little perplexed by what life offers him. Life soon tows Patrick into trouble with the Western Plateau Local Patrol and the subsequent processes of the law. Patrick is sentenced to do some jail time for possession of drugs, but he deals with it the only way he knows how to: as just another ‚Äì albeit dark ‚Äì chapter in his life. Patrick's frank and grounded take on life makes him, despite his uninformed life choices, a character who is thoroughly easy to empathise with. Senior Sergeant Testafiglia runs the Western Plateau Local Patrol. His strong European values ‚Äì that have always been his ally ‚Äì must sustain an equally strong battering when his life, and more poignantly, the lives of his family become complicated by a rape issue he is dealing with at work. Testafiglia's teenage daughter is becoming a woman; and fears that he hadn't fully considered begin to flood into his reality. However, they become the catalyst that sees the humanisation of his character, and a regrowth of the Testafiglia family dynamic. Sonja Marmeladova migrated to Australia with her family from Russia five years ago. She is in year nine at the local high school, but is quite bored by the students and the curriculum. She is beyond her years in intelligence, and feels she is yet to find a place in her adopted community. The Marmeladovas live in a Housing Commission flat where, by a random incident, Sonja meets a young man who has recently moved into the same block of flats: Patrick White‚Äìback out from his completed jail sentence. The two are immediately attracted to each other and become lovers‚Äìcomplicating their already confused lives, and further complicating the cultural shock her family is suffering in Western Sydney. Sonja and Patrick's relationship is deep and devouring but, like a narcotic, has side-effects, and for Sonja, after so much indulgence, a moment of clarity. Abdullah Najib and his mates love driving through the suburbs in the Subaru WRX, looking for chicks they can all have a lash at. Abdullah is proud to be Lebanese, although he has an increasing dislike for his immediate family who seem to have sunk into the Aussie way of life. He is outwardly very sure of himself, and finds it easy to make people see things his way. But his attitude ‚Äì like his hormones ‚Äì is getting out of control. Abdullah's character is a particularly clear example of the way none of the characters in Luck in the Greater West are simply good or bad, but are all complex combinations of qualities. The lives of all the characters and their situations interweave through the text, and all become involved ‚Äì with differing perspectives ‚Äì in the central issues of the manuscript. Each of the narratives of the piece have a conclusion. However, as it is a work of realism, not everything concludes as the narrative trajectory would suggest. Testafiglia, despite his growing hate and disappointment, becomes a better father to his now pregnant teenage daughter. Abdullah, who receives a long jail term for the rapes he and his mates inflicted on numerous young women, becomes enlightened after becoming the victim of a serious assault, and then receiving a visit from the young mother of his soon-to-be- born child‚ÄìTestafiglia's daughter. Patrick, who has had to deal with the break-up of his relationship with Sonja, begins to put his life back together‚Äìin his own way‚Äìand moves in with his previous girlfriend, and the reader is witness to the bitter-sweet way this slice of Patrick's life has turned out. The piece comments not only on contemporary life in Western Sydney, but life in the greater Western world. It deals with dark issues, but is also peppered with humour and intertextuality. The target readership for this piece is young, relatively well-read adults, and those with an interest in contemporary Australian literature; and, of course, anyone who enjoys reading. The book would also be appropriate for study by tertiary literature students as an example of topical, contemporary Australian literature and intertextuality, and also to latter secondary school students as an example of literature that deals with contemporary Western issues. McDonald has two subsequent works yet to be published: one is a semi auto-biographic novel about life as a struggling rock musician in Sydney's underground; the other is a literature novel concerning a young Middle Eastern woman trying to make a career in the entertainment industry despite the conflicts it causes in her family. McDonald also has poetry and short stories published in the University of Sydney's Hermes journal, and several independent literary journals published by UWS Press.

Underwriter was outfitted as a gunboat, whose primary task was to prevent ships from penetrating the Union blockade of Southern ports. Built in Brooklyn, New York, in 1852 The Underwriter‚Äîa side-wheel steamer built in 1852 at Brooklyn, New York‚Äîwas purchased by the Navy at New York City on 23 August 1861, and commissioned there on 22 August, Lt. James M. Prichett in command. Civil War operations =Assigned to the Potomac River Flotilla= Assigned to the Potomac Flotilla, the USS Underwriter arrived in the Potomac River off Aquia Creek, Virginia, ill-prepared for active duty, and was sent to the Washington Navy Yard on 28 August for extensive repairs and alterations. While laid up, she was transferred to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. The vessel sailed for Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 3 October and joined the blockade off Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, on 9 October. =Transferred to the North Atlantic Blockade= The Underwriter, , and left Hatteras Inlet on 14 November 1861, and proceeded southwest to Ocracoke Inlet. There, they scuttled three stone-filled hulks, effectively closing the inlet to Confederate shipping. The three vessels also participated in the capture of Confederate works on Roanoke Island, North Carolina, on 7‚Äì8 February 1862, and saw action during the capture of Elizabeth City, North Carolina, on 10 February 1862. On 13 February 1862, the Underwriter, , , and proceeded up the North River, North Carolina, and placed obstructions at the mouth of the Albemarle and Chesapeake Canal. The Underwriter assisted in the capture of New Bern, North Carolina, on 13‚Äì14 March 1862, knocking out a Confederate battery along the Neuse River during the attack. After additional support duties in both Albemarle and Albemarle Sounds, the vessel returned to Baltimore, Maryland, on 1 June 1862 for repairs. = North Carolina operations = The Underwriter left Baltimore in late July 1862 and returned to New Bern. She remained in the Neuse River off New Bern performing various reconnaissance and dispatch assignments‚Äîoccasionally moving to different points in the North Carolina sounds. The Underwriter sailed to Plymouth, North Carolina, in August and towed the prize schooner Young Rover to New Bern on 13 August 1862. She was ordered to report to Plymouth for reconnaissance duty on 4 December and sailed from there to Hatteras Inlet on 17 December. On 4 January 1863, she sailed up the Chowan River 15 miles beyond Winfield, North Carolina, and destroyed Confederate supplies. The Underwriter evacuated Union forces from Winfield during the siege and threatened capture of Plymouth in April 1863. She was stationed in Albemarle Sound later that month and returned to Plymouth in May. The Underwriter stood down the Neuse River in June and was ordered to report to the blockade off Hatteras Inlet on 16 December 1863. She returned to New Bern on 10 January 1864. =Captured by Southern forces= While lying at anchor off New Bern early on 2 February 1864, the Underwriter was captured by a Confederate boat crew led by Commander John Taylor Wood, grandson of President Zachary Taylor and a nephew of President Jefferson Davis. They caught the Underwriter crew by surprise and took her in hand-to-hand combat, killing Acting Master Jacob Westervelt and capturing most of the vessel's complement. The gunboat did not have steam up, so the Confederates burned her, as they were under heavy fire from surrounding Union batteries. The ship burned to the waterline, but her machinery was relatively unscathed. Her boilers and engines were later salvaged.

The structure, 20 m (65.6 ft) high, is made up of bronze sculptures resting on an obelisk-shaped stone pedestal, which in turn stands atop four trapezoidal prisms linked to each other by arcs. Beneath this entire complex is a circular stone base. Attached to the top of the obelisk, which reaches 15 m, is a 5-meter, 5-ton statue depicting a flying man, his wings outstretched. The folds of a shawl fall from his waist onto the obelisk. Three aviators, each in a different stage of flight attempt, are depicted around the base of the obelisk. On the pedestal are the aviators' insignia, helmet and equipment, as well as engraved plaques with the names of Romanian airmen who had crashed to their deaths by the time the monument was built. These men died pursuing various goals: skill development, performance, adventure and fighting in World War I. The first name is that of Gheorghe Caranda, killed on 20 April 1912 on an airfield during a training flight; the last is that of Sava Rotaru, killed on 29 May 1934 in thick fog in the hills around CernavodƒÉ. After the official dedication, 99 additional names have been posted on the North bottom side of the pedestal. History In 1927 a committee was formed for the construction of the Aviators' Monument. This body was made up of Prof. I. Cantacuzino; General Vasile Rudeanu; Victor Atanasiu, a colonel in the Romanian Air Force's medical corps; and the pilots Cornel OlƒÉnescu and Mihai Oromolu. The committee initiated a contest for designing the monument, and invited interested artists, painters and sculptors to participate. Twenty designs were submitted and exposed at the Romanian Athenaeum in order to allow the public to choose the winner by secret ballot. The winning design, that of architect Lidia Kotzebuie, used as a model for the aviator's body that of Joe Louis, who visited Bucharest around that time, while the head was based on an image found in a catalogue of famous aviators.RƒÉdoi. In July 1927, the committee asked Kotzebuie to execute a model one quarter the size of the planned monument by that October 1; on October 27, it officially approved her project. In 1930, with the help of the Air Ministry, material from the Arge≈ü River was brought to the Malaxa Factory, where the statue was to be produced. There, in May 1930, in the architect‚Äôs presence, the statue was cast in bronze, after a plaster model. On July 21, 1935, the monument was inscribed ‚ÄúEroilor Aerului‚Äù (‚ÄúTo the Airmen Heroes‚Äù); the original lettering has been preserved. At its unveiling the following day, leading state authorities were present, as well as ministers and representatives of the Air Ministry; speeches were delivered and congratulations offered to the architect and all those who participated in the project. The event closed with a military parade made up of honour guards and aviators, and military honours were awarded to the pilots mentioned on the lists at the base of the monument. In 1981, a miniature copy accompanied cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu into outer space. After the fall of the Communist regime in 1989, the ornamental design above the dedication, representing the cross of the Order of Aeronautical Virtue (a cross with its side bar shaped like wings, a pair of crossed swords and the Coat of arms of Romania) was restored. Each Aviators‚Äô Day (July 20), wreaths and bouquets of flowers are laid before the monument in honour of those commemorated that day.

Warren Air Force Base in 1953 Women in the Air Force (WAF) was a program which served to bring women into limited roles in the United States Air Force. WAF was formed in 1948 when President Truman signed the Women's Armed Services Integration Act, allowing women to serve directly in the military.Witt, 2005, pp. 5‚Äì6. The WAF program ended in 1976 when women were accepted into the USAF on an equal basis with men. WAF was distinct from the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS), a small group of female civilian transport pilots that was formed in 1942 with Nancy H. Love as commander. WAFS was folded into the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs) in 1943; WASP was disbanded in December 1944. Life in the WAF Lackland AFB in 1948 When the USAF was officially formed in 1947, a number of former Women's Army Corps members (WACs) continued serving in the Army but performed Air Force duties, as the Air Force did not admit women in its first year. Some WACs chose to transfer to the WAFs when it became possible. At its inception in 1948, WAF was limited to 4,000 enlisted women and 300 female officers. Women were encouraged to fill many different roles but were not to be trained as pilots, even though the United States Army Air Corps had graduated their first class of female pilots in April 1943 under wartime conditions. The WAF directorship was to be filled by a non-pilot. All WAFs were assigned ground duties, most ending up in clerical and medical positions. Women who were already pilots and who would have been good candidates for WAF leadership were instead diverted to the Air Force Reserves. For example, Nancy Harkness Love, founder and commander of the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Squadron (WAFS) and executive of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASPs), was awarded the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Reserves in 1948 after it was directed to admit women. Jacqueline Cochran, who had volunteered in the RAF and had demonstrated solid leadership in greatly expanding the WASP program, was similarly directed to join the Reserves in 1948 within which she rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1969. Female pilots in the Reserves were classified as federal civilian employees, not active military personnel. =Directors= A 1952 WAF officer candidate salutes in front of the American flag The first director of WAF was Colonel Geraldine Pratt May, who received her first commission in August 1942. She had been among the first women officers assigned to the Army Air Forces, where she served as WAC staff director within Air Transport Command. May's wartime command at \\"Air WAC\\" included 6,000 enlisted women and officers. On becoming director of WAF, May was promoted to full colonel, the first woman in the Air Force to attain that rank. May served until 1951 at which time she accepted a non-military government post.Arlington National Cemetery website Geraldine Pratt May, Colonel, United States Air Force. Mary Jo Shelly picked up the WAF directorship in 1951. Shelly was among the first women officers in the Navy and had been instrumental in setting up WAVES training in 1942; after the war she had returned to civilian life as assistant to the president of Bennington College. In WAF, Shelly worked to expand women's assignments within the USAF, as most women were still being placed in traditional \\"women's jobs\\" such as stenographer or nurse. A push to employ women in more technical fields was undertaken. Some male USAF commanders were interested in the good results obtained by using women in air defense control centers, passenger air transport operations and in data processing and analysis. Others wanted to see women restricted to a few tightly defined roles. Against the ingrained male-dominated military habits, Shelly achieved only limited success; her outgoing report in 1954 stated that the WAF was fated to remain small and exclusive as long as Selective Service applied only to men.Witt, 2005, p. 67. General Janet C. Wolfenbarger is the highest-ranking woman in the USAF. Colonel Phyllis D. S. Gray, another ex-WAVE, was director of WAF starting in 1954. She passed the baton to Colonel Emma J. Riley in 1957. Riley linked forces with Army Colonel Mary Louise Milligan (WAC) to work with the Defense Department Advisory Committee on Women in the Services (DACOWITS) in a successful attempt to retroactively grant active military service status (and its benefits) to former WAACs (Women's Auxiliary Air Corps) who had served in World War II and had also been in WAC, WAF or one of the other women's services. Riley pointed out to a Congressional subcommittee that SPARS, WAVES and female Marines had been given active duty status but Army and Air Force women had not. The bill passed in 1959 and approximately 1,400 women gained additional active duty credit. WAACs who had chosen not to continue service would wait until 1980 to be granted this status.

Lackland Air Force Base, near San Antonio, Texas, was where the first cadre of WAFs reported. Recruits were expected to appear attractive and were schooled in posture and cosmetics along with their physical training and military indoctrination. African-American recruits joined the WAFs in greater numbers in 1949 when basic training for women was desegregated in the USAF. Integration of quarters and mess was slower in coming.Dr. Judith Bellafaire, (2006). Women's Memorial History Archive: Volunteering For Vietnam: African- American Servicewomen Captain Barbara A. Wilson, first enlisted WAF to complete Officer Training School Barbara A. Wilson started as a Private at Lackland then steadily moved up the ranks. She was the first WAF to complete her Bachelor of Arts degree through a military program at Long Island University. She was the first enlisted WAF NCO (Technical Sergeant) to become an officer via Officer Training School (OTS). She retired at the rank of Major, and earned a master's degree in an Air Force Program at Southern Illinois University. She produced and hosted a TV program about antiques and wrote as a syndicated newspaper columnist in the '80s. Wilson, writing as \\"Captain Barb\\", maintains a website with information about women in all branches of the military: Women Military Veterans: Yesterday‚ÄîToday‚ÄîTomorrow. The first African-American female brigadier general of the USAF was Marcelite J. Harris who attained the rank in 1990. Harris took OTS at Lackland in 1966, after traveling with a USO tour to military bases in Germany and France. Harris said in a 1992 interview with Ebony: \\"Originally, I wanted to be an actress.\\" After graduating from Spelman College with a BA in speech and drama she joined the WAFs. Specializing in aircraft maintenance, she served as a supervisor at Korat Air Base in Thailand, servicing Vietnam war aircraft. Harris later became Air Officer Commanding at the United States Air Force Academy in Colorado. She even picked up a degree in Business Management along the way. Circa 1992 Harris held a command at HQ USAF, Washington, DC, where she was responsible for 125,000 airmen and an annual budget of $20 billion.Ebony magazine interview: Brig. Gen. Marcelite J. Harris: the Air Force's first black female general. December 1992 She retired in 1997. =Uniforms= The first WAFs wore men's uniforms with neckties.Witt, 2005, p. 53. Geraldine Pratt May quickly ordered women's uniforms, selecting herself the particular shade of blue. The cut of the winter uniform was modeled after those of airline flight attendants, using the same material as the men's winter uniforms. Instead of a necktie, tabs were worn on the collar. The effect was considered \\"smart and contemporary\\", The two-piece summer uniform, however, made of cotton-cord seersucker, fit poorly and required frequent ironing. The WAF Band poses at USAF Band School at Bolling AFB in Washington, DC =WAF Band= The 543rd Air Force Band (WAF) was organized in January 1951 by Colonel George S. Howard, Chief of Bands and Music for the Air Force. Eighteen women musicians were directed by Private First Class Mary Divens. In December 1951, MaryBelle Johns Nissly was recruited by Howard to return to military life at the rank of captain to be given the tasks of conductor and commander of the WAF Band.Witt, 2005, p. 167. Nissly had left Army service in 1946 as a warrant officer and had previously gained attention as a sergeant by starting the first Women's Army Band at Fort Des Moines in 1942 while she was with the Women's Auxiliary Air Corps (WAAC). In its ten-year lifespan, the WAF Band was served by some 235 women musicians with approximately 50 members at any one time. Attrition from the organization was often caused by marriage, as band members were required to be single. They also had to be white; the Air Force knew the WAF Band would be touring the segregated Deep South and they did not want to cross the race barrier. Concerts were played all over the nation, including Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico. At least one concert took them to Mexico.https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/135909/waf- band-still-making-music/ Colonel George S. Howard, USAF Chief of Bands and Music The band marched in Eisenhower's two inaugurations, played in the freezing cold for JFK's inauguration and appeared occasionally on live television broadcasts. Home base for the WAF Band was first Lackland, moving in 1953 to Bolling AFB in Washington, DC, where, by Air Force Regulation 190-21, published June 13, 1955, they were officially designated \\"United States WAF Band\\", acknowledging their de facto status as USAF representatives rather than their former status as a simple base band. Their official mission became to \\"assist, within their capabilities, in promoting Air Force objectives and enhancing the prestige of the Air Force and the United States.\\" This meant there were now two bands serving as ambassadors of the USAF: the all-male Air Force Band and the WAF Band. In 1957, while flying aboard a C-124 Globemaster II, the WAF Band was invited by General James L. Jackson, Deputy Commander of the San Bernardino Air Materiel Area, Air Materiel Command,Air Force biography: Brigadier General James L. Jackson to move to his headquarters at Norton AFB in San Bernardino, California. The move took place in January 1958. The band retained its training and chain-of-command connection with the USAF band school at Bolling. At Norton, the band found it easier to schedule C-124 planes and pilots to keep up their touring schedule. The first five enlisted WAFs in Vietnam arrive along with the fourth WAF officer. From bottom: Lt Col June H. Hilton, A1C Carol J. Hornick, A1C Rita M. Pitcock, SSgt Barbara J. Snavely, A1C Shirley J. Brown, and A1C Eva M. Nordstrom. Tan Son Nhut Air Base, June 1967 The WAF Band was inactivated in 1961, most likely victims of their success. Colonel Howard, as leader of the all-male band, had apparently grown less eager to share the spotlight. In 1960, he had diverted a special request for the WAFs to perform in Europe, substituting his band instead. That same year Howard issued a directive forbidding the WAF Band to appear at any civilian functions such as county fairs and schools where they had become popular. Nissly continued to accept these civilian invitations in contravention of the directive, allowing anti- women elements in the USAF an excuse to charge the WAF Band with insubordination. The band was dissolved. Band members were given the option of transferring to a different WAF unit but some left the service entirely. Colonel Howard retired on September 1, 1963. Nissly retired at the rank of Major in 1968. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music holds the Martha Awkerman WAF and Long Beach Band Papers, 1940-2002 which consists of scrapbooks, photographs, and recordings of cornet soloist Martha Awkerman and the WAF Band. =ROTC program= Maj. Gen. Wendy M. Masiello obtained her commission via ROTC at Texas Tech University. In 1956, a WAF section was introduced into the Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program. Miss Janet Marshall of George Washington University was the first woman to enroll in the WAF Cadet ROTC Program. The program was ordered to be phased out by 1960 by order of the Secretary of the Air Force. By 1959 only 3 WAF ROTC units remained. The downturn was not permanent and by 1970, the Air Force ROTC women cadet program had expanded to a more national scope. Major General Wendy M. Masiello, a 1980 graduate of Texas Tech University, is an example of high- ranking woman officer who was commissioned via Air Force ROTC. Closing chapter In 1967, President Johnson signed Public Law 90-130, lifting grade restrictions and strength limitations on women in the military.Witt, 2005, p. 199. 1973 saw the end of Selective Service (the \\"draft\\"), meaning military recruiting practices were beginning to experience radical changes. In 1976, women were accepted into the military on much the same basis as men; the separate status of WAF was abolished. That same year, the United States Air Force Academy began accepting females.

Murphy is a former North Carolina farmer, Democratic politician, and namesake of the Wendell H. Murphy Football Center. Early life Wendell H. Murphy was born in Rose Hill, North Carolina. In 1960, Murphy received a B.S. in agriculture from North Carolina State University. After graduating from college, Murphy became an agriculture teacher, but soon Wendell and his dad, Holmes Murphy, opened a feeding manufacturing operation. The operation started in 1964 with area farmers in open lots. By 1979, Wendell and Holmes Murphy had started sow and farrowing operations as well. The business is now known as Murphy Family Ventures and is a contract grower for Smithfield Foods. Political career In 1983, Murphy was elected to the North Carolina House of Representatives as a Democrat. He represented North Carolina's tenth district until 1988. He was then elected to the North Carolina Senate where he served until 1992. During this time, Murphy received a lot of attention for his work in politics including the Tar Heel of the Week Award by The News & Observer in May 1987 and the Order of the Long Leaf Pine in 1988. Murphy was later profiled by the News and Observer in their Pulitzer prize-winning \\"Boss Hog\\" series. In these investigative pieces, the N&O; illustrated the rise of the hog industry in North Carolina with the help of politicians, such as Murphy. Critics of Murphy claim that the laws he passed helped to enable unsustainable growth in the hog industry, which later caused massive water pollution resulting in fish kills throughout eastern North Carolina. Proponents on the other hand claim that his legislation helped to expand the industry at a time when it was needed to offset the job losses caused by the decline of tobacco farming. =North Carolina State University stadium= While in politics, Murphy also helped with North Carolina State University athletics. He was a member of the Centennial Authority, which helped develop the RBC Center, the home for NC State Wolfpack men's basketball along with the Carolina Hurricanes and Carolina Cobras. In 1987, while serving as senator, Murphy sponsored legislation that gave $1.5 million for the initial planning of the RBC Center. Murphy then kept working to get funding to the stadium until he eventually got $22 million donated to the project. For his work with North Carolina State University athletics, the Wendell H. Murphy Football Center was named after Murphy in 2003. Personal Wendell Murphy now lives in his birthplace of Rose Hill, North Carolina with his wife Linda. He has four children and seven grandchildren.

John Waterhouse, a Yorkshire Methodist, and was born in London. He attended Kingswood School in Bath from 1832 until 1835 when he was apprenticed to a printer. The Waterhouse family migrated to Australia in 1839 when John Waterhouse became general superintendent of the Wesleyan Methodist Mission in Australia. When the family settled in Hobart a printing company was bought and Jabez managed it. The following year Jabez became a local preacher ministering to convicts. He became a probationer in 1842 and, after studying at Richmond Theological College, he was ordained in the Methodist chapel, Spitalfields. On August 13, 1847, Waterhouse married Maria Augusta, n√©e Bode, at Windsor, Berkshire. Australian ministry In 1847, Waterhouse returned to Van Diemen's Land and during the following eight years was appointed to the Hobart, Westbury, Campbell Town and Longford circuits. He was appointed to South Australia in 1855 serving in Kapunda, Willunga and Adelaide. In 1862, he was secretary of the Australasian Conference of the Wesleyan Church held in Adelaide. After transferring to New South Wales in 1864, Waterhouse served in Maitland, Goulburn, Orange, Waverley, Parramatta, Newcastle and Glebe. He was elected secretary of the New South Wales and Queensland Annual Conference in 1874 and 1875, president in 1876 and secretary of the first three general conferences of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church (Melbourne 1875, Sydney 1878 and Adelaide 1881). Legacy Waterhouse's ministry was supported by his sound financial expertise and he was noted as a gifted preacher within his church.

The IOTV is compatible with the Deltoid and Auxiliary Protector System (DAPS) components, ESAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert), Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts (ESBI), as well as the OTV's groin protector. It has a flame-resistant stand- alone shirt known as the Army Combat Shirt designed specifically for use with the IOTV. The OTV design was considered insufficient and lacking in certain areas, which led to the IOTV's development and fielding. The IOTV is currently produced by Point Blank Body Armor, BAE Systems, KDH Defense Systems, Protective Products Enterprises,Protective Products Enterprises IOTV UNICOR and Creative Apparel Associates. The IOTV first saw action in combat with U.S. Army ground combat units in from mid-2007https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083401/http://www.mnf- iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&task;=view&id;=12519&Itemid;=1 onward and currently remains the standard body armor type used by regular U.S. Army ground combat units overseas.  Background  While the Interceptor Body Armor and the Outer Tactical Vest were considered fairly effective, questions were raised over whether or not they were the best possible armor solution for soldiers of the United States Military. This debate was heightened by controversy over Dragon Skin, produced by the now defunct Pinnacle Armor. Various claims surfaced that Dragon Skin was more effective at protecting soldiers than the then standard issue Interceptor body armor system, with independent studies and reports seeming to back these claims, eventually leading to multiple congressional members asking for further evaluation. In response, the military made public testing that showed widespread failures in the testing of the Dragon Skin armor. Ultimately, Dragon Skin never saw widespread adoption, and many of the perceived shortfalls of the Outer Tactical Vest such as standard of protection or modularity were addressed in the new Improved Outer Tactical Vest and E-SAPI plates. Technical details A size Medium IOTV weighs , less than a Medium OTV vest, while providing more coverage. However, a fully equipped IOTV, complete with all its components (soft armor panel inserts, four ballistic plate inserts (front and back plates and two side plates), collar, and groin protectors) still weighs , with a Large IOTV weighing about . The functionality of the enhanced side ballistic inserts, which provide coverage under the arms and down the sides of the torso, is built into the IOTV. The IOTV provides the ability to don the vest in two ways. The first is to simply place the vest over the head and pull down, and the second is to remove fasteners on the wearer's left shoulder, sliding into the vest to the right. To complete the procedure for both methods the wearer then lifts up the front panel of the vest and fastens the waistband, which takes the weight of the vest off the shoulders somewhat, and then fastens the side protection modules. A key design feature for the IOTV is that the entire armor system is able to be released with the pull of a hidden lanyard. The armor then falls apart into its component pieces, providing a means for escape in case the wearer falls into water or becomes trapped in a hazardous environment.Army to Field Improved Body Armor The hidden release lanyard also allows medical personnel easier access to a casualty, which was one concern that was not addressed with the old Interceptor armor. It also features a grid of PALS webbing on the front, back, and sides for the attachment of modular pouches and accessories such as neck and throat protection, groin protection, or deltoid protection. =Female model= In response to the large numbers of female soldiers in the army, a female- specific version of the IOTV (F-IOTV) was developed. Previously, standard tactical vests were issued to women in combat. Army soldiers found that women's movement was restricted, in ways such as bending over, getting in and out of tight spaces, or positioning their rifles against their shoulders. The long armor plates inside the vests would also rub against their hips and cut into their thighs when they sat down. Development of a model for women began in 2009. After much testing and measurements, the Army came up with a vest that is shorter to accommodate smaller torsos and has tailoring to fit closer to women's chests. The new vest eliminates gaps between the material and the body and can be fitted with smaller side ballistic inserts for small waist sizes. The vest has a lighter feel because it doesn‚Äôt rest on the female soldier's shoulders like the male vest. The first female soldier vests were given to soldiers deploying for Afghanistan in September 2012. Features Nearly all modern military body armor is designed to prevent penetration from bullets to vital areas of the body, in addition to protection against knives and fragmentation from explosives. Typically this is accomplished through both highly durable woven synthetic fibers such as Kevlar or Dyneema, and either metal or ceramic trauma plates. The IOTV is the standard issue torso protection component to the United States Army. The IOTV is designed to take the weight of the vest off the shoulders and move it to the lower torso. The vest is also equipped with a mesh inner cover that is designed to improve airflow inside of the armor. There is also a back pad in the lower back area of the vest, which is designed to defeat fragmentation impacts to the lower back/kidney areas. However, the back pad does not provide significant ballistic protection. The vest can withstand a direct impact from a 7.62 millimeter (both NATO and ex-Soviet types) on the front or rear if using the older SAPI plates (NIJ standard III). Use of the new E-SAPI plates increase protection to armor-piercing versions of the aforementioned rounds in addition to .30-06 Springfield M2 armor-piercing rounds (NIJ standard IV). The IOTV provides, without the ballistic ceramic plates inserted, protection from small caliber rounds (i.e. 9mm) and fragmentation. The soft kevlar panels have been tested to stop 9 mm 124 grain full metal jacket bullets at 1,400 ft/s (426 m/s) with minimal deformation and has a V-50 of roughly 1,525 ft/s (465 m/s). This means that the bullet has to be traveling faster than 1,525 ft/s for it to have more than a 50% chance of breaking through the soft armor panel. These specifications are similar to the NIJ standard level III-A certification, however, military standards do not require their vests to be NIJ certified as this is primarily a law enforcement standard. The modular design of the vest allows greater tactical flexibility in regards to different situations faced by ground troops. A US Army medical research report concluded that greater modular design leads to the ability to find a more effective balance between projectile protection and the physical endurance of the soldier, preventing losses in agility and mobility, and therefore reducing potential injuries or casualties. = E-SAPI Plates = E-SAPI (Enhanced Small Arms Protective Insert) plates and their smaller counterparts E-SBI (Enhanced Side Ballistic Inserts) plates, are ceramic trauma plates that provide the bulk of the protection against projectiles when carried in an Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and are also used as part of many other body armors such as the Modular Tactical Vest. E-SAPI plates are designed to cover the vital front and back torso areas of the torso, while E-SBI plates are designed to protect the sides of the torso. The plate component itself is made of boron carbide, a widely used and extremely hard boron-carbon ceramic. Backing the plate is a layer of Spectra, a woven polymer material with extremely high tensile strength meant to stop any projectile that manages to pass through the ceramic strikeface. When a bullet strikes the E-SAPI plate, the kinetic energy is dispersed throughout the ceramic layer, and the majority of military rounds in common use are stopped or broken up. If the bullet continues through the boron carbide layer, the Spectra backing either stops the bullet, or, if the bullet was powerful enough, allows the bullet to pass through into the IOTV itself, and likely the wearer. Even in the event of the E-SAPI plate failing to prevent penetration, the velocity and energy of the penetrating round is oftentimes reduced to the point where the resulting wound is non lethal. E-SAPI plates are manufactured by Armorworks Enterprises, Ceradyne, Simula, and BAE Systems. Durability standards are high for E-SAPI plates, with Army requirements on environmental condition testing involving the plates being kept 6 hours at both a high temperature and a low temperature in addition to being dropped twice among a variety of other requirements. USSOCOM requirements are even more stringent, involving 24 hours at high and low temperatures. While E-SAPI plates do hold significant defensive advantages over the preceding SAPI plates, the increased protection comes at the cost of increased weight and significantly increased cost. Comparing medium-sized plates, a SAPI plate weighs 1.82 kilograms while an E-SAPI plate weighs 2.5 kilograms, over a 35 percent increase in weight. In regards to cost, E-SAPI plates cost 50 percent more, coming in at approximately $600 per plate. SAPI plates were largely phased out in favor of E-SAPI plates beginning in 2005. = XSAPI Plates = XSAPI (X Threat Small Arms Protective Insert) plates are ceramic trauma plates that have begun replacement of the ESAPI. They are mostly issued to personnel in higher threat environments like Iraq or Afghanistan. The plates are tan colored and the first batch was shipped in the second quarter of 2009, Ceradyne receiving a $77 million contract for delivery. Its threat level is presumably against the M993 7.62 NATO penetrator, as denoted by the back's marking. Note the AP/WC, which stands for Wolfram Carbide, Wolfram meaning tungsten in German, or Tungsten Carbide. The AP stands for Armor Piercing, and as such, the threat is 7.62 Armor Piercing Wolfram Carbide.A USMC corporal showing the E-SAPI plate which successfully stopped a bullet in combat when he was hit.  Effectiveness  The Improved Outer Tactical Vest as a whole is a huge improvement over previous armor systems, with the fragmentation vest from the Vietnam War being limited to fragmentation protection, the PASGT vest being limited to pistol rounds, and the previous Outer Tactical Vest being unable to stop armor piercing rounds. In response to the feedback of soldiers on the effectiveness of the armor system, the Army has continually upgraded the IOTV with new features, with Generation III involving a more intuitive quick release system and the new Operational Camouflage Pattern (OCP). Rather than producing entirely new IOTV armor sets, body armor conversion kits have been delivered at a lower cost in order to bring older Generation armor sets up to newer standards. = Alternatives = One criticism carried over from the older OTV to the newer IOTV is what is regarded as the excessive weight of the armor, especially by dismounted infantrymen who regard the armor almost as a liability. In response to this, the U.S. Army is looking into supplementing the heavy IOTV with the newer Modular Body Armor Vest (MBAV) and Soldier Plate Carrier System (SPCS) already in service in Ranger and Airborne units. The MBAV and SPCS do provide less soft body armor coverage, but are lighter than the IOTV, thus more suitable for patrol in Afghanistan. The Army plans to introduce the torso and extremity protection (TEP) system beginning in 2018, which includes a modular scalable vest, ballistic combat shirt, blast pelvic protection system, and battle belt to reduce overall weight from while maintaining coverage by reducing excess bulk.Deploying soldiers could see lighter body armor by 2018 - Armytimes.com, 16 April 2017  Users  * : U.S. Armyhttp://www.tactical- life.com/news/iotv-body-armor-improved-outer-tactical- vest/https://2002-2009-fpc.state.gov/88477.htm * : Nearly a thousand vests purchased by Ukraine from private owners between 2014 and 2016, and utilized by Ukrainian soldiers involved in combating the Russian invasion of eastern Ukraine.

Connecticut in uniform with medals. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress USS Connecticut (1861) was a large steamer acquired by the Union Navy during the American Civil War. Her primary task was to prevent ships from penetrating the Union blockade of Southern ports. Connecticut, a side wheel steamer, was built in 1861 by William Webb, New York City; purchased by the Navy 18 July 1861; and commissioned 23 August 1861, Commander M. Woodhull in command.  Supplying the Union blockade vessels  Connecticut sailed on her first voyage 25 August 1861, delivered men and supplies to ships on the blockade along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts as far as Galveston, Texas, and returned to New York 29 September. Following two patrols, from 16 to 24 October and from 10 November to 17 December in search of CS cruiser CSS Nashville, Connecticut returned to cargo duty, making five voyages similar to her first between 7 January and 15 November 1862. She also captured four schooners with valuable cargo during this period.  Panama operations  Out of commission for repairs at New York from 24 November to 15 December 1862, Connecticut left in tow of 24 December for duty as convoy and tow ship off Aspinwall, Panama, until returning to New York 6 June 1863.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  During Connecticut's next cruise, from 10 August 1863 to 25 July 1864, she operated most successfully with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Virginia and North Carolina. She captured five vessels and drove a sixth ashore, abandoned and burned by its crew. Included were the English steamer Minnie, captured 9 May 1864 with a cargo of cotton, tobacco, turpentine, and gold, one of the most valuable prizes taken during the war; and the British steamer Greyhound, taken on 10 May, which carried in addition to her cargo of cotton, tobacco, and turpentine, the famous Confederate spy Belle Boyd. Following another cruise carrying men to the fleet between 30 July and 5 October 1864, Connecticut was placed out of commission at Boston, Massachusetts, from 7 October 1864 to 17 February 1865. Her last cruise from 21 February to 3 August 1865 was in the West Indies and on the U.S. East Coast, searching for Confederate privateers and towing monitors from Port Royal, South Carolina, to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Connecticut was decommissioned 11 August 1865 at Philadelphia Navy Yard and sold 21 September 1865.

His managers included Jimmy Dixon and Cy Crespi. His trainer was Dan Florio. Early life and career DeMarco was born in Brooklyn, New York, on February 10, 1928. He was raised there and considered it his hometown. DeMarco won his first five professional fights in 1945, losing for the first time against Butch Charles in October of the same year. It was on the 10th of that month that DeMarco fought the legendary Willie Pep, whose record was an unbelievable 131-1-1 at the time. DeMarco lost the unanimous ten round decision, one of very few early setbacks. On March 4, 1949, he defeated 1989 Boxing Hall of Famer Billy Graham in a somewhat close, rather uneventful ten round unanimous decision before 8,493 at New York's Madison Square Garden. DeMarco piled up a big lead in points in the early rounds in a match that the Associated Press scored six to four for DeMarco.\\"DeMarco Upsets Graham\\", The Troy Record, Troy, New York, p. 14, 5 March 1949. Three bouts with Featherweight Champ Sandy Saddler, 1949‚Äì1951 Many consider his bouts with Sandy Saddler his best. They met three times, with DeMarco impressively winning two of the three bouts. On August 27, 1951, DeMarco beat Saddler, the reigning World Featherweight Champion, in a ten round split decision at the Arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Though he left the ring with his nose bleeding, DeMarco was the clear winner, firing with both hands, and pushing his opponent into the ropes. The bout saw no knockdowns.\\"Paddy DeMarco Sets Blazing Pace, Upsets Sandy Saddler\\", The La Crosse Tribune, La Crosse, Wisconsin, p. 14, 28 August 1951. DeMarco also beat Saddler on December 7, 1951 before 5,635, in another ten round split decision, this time at Madison Square Garden, boxing's New York cathedral. The United Press, believing he dominated gave DeMarco seven rounds with only three for Saddler. In the fifth, DeMarco clearly showed his superiority over his opponent, who was making a return to the ring after a two-month suspension. The bout saw a great deal of clinching and had both participants warned more than once for using tactics more common to wrestling than boxing matches. Saddler complained bitterly after the bout, believing he was the clear winner.Cuddy, Jack, \\"DeMarco Garners Split Decision Over Saddler\\", Courier Post, Camden, New Jersey, p. 12, 8 December 1951. In his first meeting with Saddler before 13,071 on October 28, 1949, DeMarco lost at Madison Square Garden on a ninth round TKO. Saddler lost the first three rounds on points, and then bored in and demolished his opponent. In the fourth round, Saddler made a mess of DeMarco's face, and continued to gain on points throughout the end of the eighth, when DeMarco's handlers signaled to the referee to end the bout.\\"Saddler Kayoes DeMarco in Ninth Round at Garden\\", The Times Record, Troy, New York, p. 11, 29 October 1949. =Important early career bouts= On December 22, 1949, DeMarco defeated Teddy Davis before 2,500 at the Broadway Arena in Brooklyn in an eight round unanimous decision.\\"DeMarco Defeats Davis\\", The Courier-News, Bridgewater, New Jersey, p. 19, 23 December 1949.

On February 1, 1950 DeMarco defeated Cuban lightweight contender Orlando Zulueta for the only time in a ten round unanimous decision at St. Nicholas Arena in New York. He lost to Zulueta on two other occasions in close ten round decisions at Eastern Parkway Arena in Brooklyn, first on October 27, 1952, and again on September 21, 1953. On September 24, 1951, DeMarco defeated Enrique Bolanos at the Coliseum in Chicago in a ten round unanimous decision. In a decisive victory, one judge gave DeMarco every round, and one round was the most any of the decision makers gave Bolanos in a bout where DeMarco took the offensive from the opening round. There were no knockdowns in the bout.\\"Paddy DeMarco Easily Beats Enrique Bolanos\\", Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles California, p. 55, 25 September 1951. DeMarco first defeated Henry Davis comfortably in a ten round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden on November 21, 1952. The AP gave seven rounds to DeMarco with only three to Davis. The crowd of 3,418 was not thrilled with the match as the only knockdown came in the third from Davis, and it may have been an accidental slip. Hand, Jack, \\"DeMarco Mauls Henry Davis, Seeks Title Go\\", The Daily Messenger, Canandaigua, New York, p. 6, 22 November 1952. DeMarco beat Davis again on March 14, 1953 at Boston Garden in another ten round unanimous decision. In a decisive win, both of Davis's eyes were nearly closed from swelling by the end of the bout.\\"Paddy DeMarco Defeats Davis\\", The Pantagraph, Bloomington, Illinois, p. 10, 15 March 1953. Taking the World Lightweight Championship, March 1954 In 1954, DeMarco twice challenged Black boxer and reigning World Lightweight Champion Jimmy Carter for the Lightweight Championship of the World. He won the first meeting on March 5, 1954, in a fifteen round unanimous decision at Madison Square Garden. In a major upset, that saw him as a 4-1 underdog in the early betting, DeMarco won the bout decisively on points and took the world title.\\"Paddy Wakes Up as Champ After Ten Year Dream\\", The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, Brooklyn, New York, p. 8, 6 March 1954. In the first two rounds, DeMarco gained a lead on points with close range jabs, hooks, and body punching. Though losing the fourteenth round, DeMarco dominated on points particularly from the sixth and subsequent rounds where he clearly looked the winner.\\"DeMarco Wins Lightweight Crown, Scores Upset\\", Newport Daily News, Newport, Rhode Island, p. 8, 6 March 1954. Losing the World Lightweight Championship, November 1954 In his first defense of the World Lightweight Championship, DeMarco lost the title November 17, 1954 to Jimmy Carter in a fifteen round TKO in Daley, California before 11,000 frantic fans. In the brutal and savage bout, the referee stopped the fighting in the final round, with DeMarco virtually out on his feet, his left eye nearly swollen shut, and his cheek rapidly turning a dark blue.\\"Jimmy Carter Regains Lightweight Boxing Crown by Scoring TKO\\", The Times Record, Troy, New York, p. 48, 18 November 1954. Carter had DeMarco down on the mat twice, once for a four count from a left hook to the chin in the ninth and once in the fourteenth. On October 3, 1955, though an underdog in the early betting, DeMarco defeated lightweight contender Kenny Lane in a ten round split decision at the St. Nicholas Arena in New York. DeMarco hit and held repeatedly in the bout, where clutching was common, and even threw in a few headbutts for good measure. There was little in decisive punching as Lane's southpaw stance and DeMarco's constant clutching threw off the timing of both boxers.\\"DeMarco Gets Split Verdict Over Lane\\", The Times Record, Troy, New York, p. 20, 4 October 1955. DeMarco's last fight was in November 1959. He retired with a career record of 75 wins (8 by knockout, 26 losses, and 3 draws). DeMarco died in Salt Lake City, Utah on December 13, 1997.

The series was produced by NHNZ with creator Judith Curran also acting as the series producer. Animal Planet's Martha Ripp is the executive producer of the series, and Lone Dr√∏scher Nielsen of the Borneo Orangutan Survival Foundation, the founder, and manager of the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Reintroduction Project, regularly appears with the orangutans in the show. The series premiered on Animal Planet on November 2, 2007, with new episodes airing Friday nights. A second season began airing in November 2008. The show focuses on a group of orphaned orangutans at the Nyaru Menteng Orangutan Rescue and Rehabilitation Center that are raised to go against their normally independent nature and instead cooperate and live together in a society so they can be left to live wild on their protected island.Orangutan Outreach: About the Islands A follow-up series titled Orangutan Jungle School began airing on More 4 in 2018. The Orangutans *Alibaba is a resourceful orangutan who manages to find food in the water. After studying the Teknisi and learning that they use water bottles as fish traps, Alibaba has become adept at raiding the traps to take the fish for himself. *The Bandit Boys are a group of five- and six-year-old males that formed in baby school. Known for being mischief makers, the group likes to engage in food fights and wrestling matches. ** Donald, \\"the Apprentice,\\" is a six-year-old male who came to Nyaru Menteng with Daisy. Though they were close in forest school, Donald becomes the sidekick of the larger Chen Chen, enabling him to live a mostly worry-free life. During the series, he falls victim to an unknown illness but is able to recover. In the season premiere of Season 2, Donald died of blood poisoning. Orangutan Outreach, an affiliate of the rescue group Borneo Orangutan Survival (BOS) Foundation, also reported that Donald had died. ** Mercury is one of the victims of the mysterious illness. The 'Mysterious Illness' has been defined as Ebola. ** Milo is the one who caused Bonita's retreat to the comforting Papau. ** Rocky fights with Milo for dominance when Hamlet leaves. ** Saturnus is the island's smallest male and is constantly seeking attention and discovering ways to turn anything into a toy. His love of toys earns him the nickname of \\"Pervert.\\" ** Togar is one of the original bandit boys, but after falling victim to the strange illness that struck the island, his role in the society is shaken. When he returns to the island, he is hesitant and fearful but eventually finds his place again. * Barata is Oren's best friend. * Bertha is the island's largest female. She catches the eye of Saturnus, the island's smallest male. * Bonita is a five-and-a-half-year-old female who tends to be independent and something of a loner. When the Bandit Boys bully her, she quickly loses her confidence and runs away crying. Bonita's mother was killed by poachers wanting to sell Bonita as a pet, but she was rescued and taken to the Nyaru Menteng Rescue Center, where she entered baby school. * Bule is a Palas Island Male who even impressed Daisy when she first saw him. Hamlet has tried to psych him out. He is bigger than Hamlet but a real gentle orangutan. * Cha Cha is a six-year-old female who first came to the Nyaru Menteng Rescue Center when she was 18 months old. She viewed Lone Droscher Nielsen as her surrogate mother and was initially devastated at being separated from her. Her refusal to adapt to the island causes Nielsen to question whether Cha Cha can be an independent orangutan; however, Cha Cha soon bonds with the more boisterous Daisy and comes to accept her new home. * Chakra is the male invader from Palas Island who attempt to steal a bunch of bananas but is defeated by Mogok. * Chen Chen is an eight-year-old male who is missing both eyes due to an accident on the high seas.

Compost, who is named after famed wildlife photographer Alain Compost, is nicknamed \\"The Photographer.\\" * Daisy is a feisty and determined six-year-old female who takes no prisoners. Daisy came to forest school with Donald. When Donald starts bonding with Chen Chen, Daisy becomes something of a tomboy and shows that she can hold her own in an altercation. Her willingness to stand up to bullies earned her the nickname \\"Sheriff Daisy.\\" Brave, determined, and sometimes rebellious, Daisy is one of the island's best foragers. Showing she can also be gentle, Daisy befriends the less confident Cha Cha. * Guy is a Palas Island male who mostly pleasures himself to the thought of Manisa. * Hamlet, called the \\"Intruder,\\" is a 10-year-old male who escapes from the nearby Palas Island to make his home on Orangutan Island. In his first appearance on the show, he kidnaps Jasmine. However, despite this rude introduction, his five years of experience in the wild enables him to help the less experienced newcomers survive their first rainy season. Towards the end of season 1, Hamlet is deposed by Reno and then builds a relationship with Papau. Eventually Hamlet regains his position. * Hardi is a newborn 20 year old baby who appears with his mother, Kiki, in season 2. * Hercules is a 20-year-old male. He is more aggressive than other adult orangutans on Orangutan Island. This Orangutan is not on Orangutan Island * Jasmine is a darker-colored, six-year-old female who is popular with the young males on the island, earning her the nickname of \\"Femme Fatale.\\" Confident and self-sufficient, she rarely gets time away from her admirers. * Jordan is a six-year-old who came to Nyaru Menteng after being rescued from an illegal stage show, where he was trained to wrestle with other orangutans. Having been stolen from his mother while still a baby, he has little experience interacting with other orangutans and enters the island at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Jordan once attacked alpha male Hamlet with a bottle, but Hamlet seemed to be understanding and didn't punish him severely. Owing to a deviated septum, Jordan has a constantly running nose. In episode 4, he attempted to drink the engine oil out of a bottle he has found, which would have killed him had the Teknisi not spotted him in time. * Jupiter is a female who takes a liking to water. She discovers a new food source, fish. * Kacio is a six-year-old female who shows that Chen Chen has a soft side by playing with him on the platform in episode 3. She is also a friend of Yeyen and Nadi. * Kiki is a 15-year-old female. Kiki was kept as a pet in a cage under a house, and she could not walk or climb when she was rescued--she rolled everywhere. She was released to Palas Island and now has become a regular on Orangutan Island. * Komo, a Palas Island male, could possibly take Chen Chen's position in the hierarchy. * Mac is a Palas Island male who visited Orangutan Island with Hamlet in Season 1. Something of a bully, he has tried to challenge Hamlet for dominance; he also makes Hamlet jealous. * Mangis was rescued when she was a toddler. Her nickname is \\"Spoiled Princess\\" because she is always lazy. * Manisa is a Palas Island female with looks similar to those of Sayla and Nor. Despite her large size, she is really a quiet and sweet orangutan. * Marly was introduced to Tati when Tati first came to Orangutan Island. * Mego is a Palas Island male. He came to Orangutan Island in season 2. * Mentos is a Palas Island female, part of the Palas Island Girl Gang, who is known for beating up Mangis and acting tough. She likes to assert her dominance whenever she can. * Mogok is a brave young male who challenges the much larger invader Chakra by stealing back the group's bananas. Earlier on in the season Mogok went missing, prompting Lone and the Teknisi to form a search party. Mogok is eventually found on the opposite side of the island six days later, looking perfectly healthy. His six-day survival was a good sign for his fellow orangutans. * Mustafa is also one of the adults on Orangutan Island. He was released into Nyaru Menteng's new forest. * Nadi was found in a small cage outside of a house suffering from severe malnourishment. Nadi hates boat rides after having been transported to Nyaru Menteng in a boat and has to be sedated during the boat trip to Palas 2. Hypervigilant, she is quick to sound the alarm at the first sign of potential danger. After a scuffle with Daisy, Nadi is bitten by a pit viper but recovers with the help of Nielsen. * Nor is a Palas Island female who wants to attack Mangis. She spies the Teknisi and the other Orangutan Island orangutans searching for Mangis. * Oren is Barata's best friend. * Oyoy was an independent male. After he went missing in episode 3, he was found dead, facedown in the river. Lone believes he fell out of a tree. * Papau at nine years of age is the oldest female on the island and is known for her maternal manner. She often cares for the shyer Bonita. Towards the end of season 1, she forms a bond with Hamlet. * Peanut is a two-year-old male orphan who appeared on episode 1 in season 2. * Pickle is Lone's roommate on episode 1 in season 2. * Randang is a female orangutan two to two and a half years old. When Bonita is sent to forest school to recover from an illness, Randang keeps climbing on Bonita's back as if she were her mother. * Reno is a six-year-old male who uses Hamlet's absence to challenge Chen Chen's dominance. He is strong, clever and a totally mean bully. He, along with Hamlet and Chen Chen, is one of the strongest on the island, and was the main antagonist of the Season 1 finale. * Ruby is a three-year-old female whose mother was killed by poachers. She is saved and sent to the Nyaru Menteng Rescue Center. On the first episode in season 2, she is bitten by a macaque. * Sayla is a Palas Island female, part of the Palas Island Girl Gang.

In the spring I finally received green light to return home to my wonderful red friends at Nyaru Menteng. Though at first only for a trial period to see if my health could keep up. Luckily my health kept up fine with my Borneo visit and my three weeks in the forest passed without problems.\\" Releasing rehabilitated orangutans to their natural habitat is the ultimate goal of orangutan sanctuaries. On February 15, 2013, Mogok became the first of the orangutans depicted in the series to be released to the wild as part of a group of five semi-wild and 15 rehabilitated orangutans who were transported from the Central Kalimantan Orangutan Reintroduction Program at Nyaru Menteng to release points in Bukit Batikap Conservation Forest over a period of three days.http://goingback2dforest.wordpress.com/2013/02/20/news-from-bukit- batikap-part-2/ The following day, Alibaba became the second orangutan from the series to be released.http://goingback2dforest.wordpress.com/2013/02/21/news-from-batikap- part-3-final/ After spending a few months in the wild, Mogok contracted a massive threadworm infection, and trackers found him very weak. He was evacuated back to Nyaru Menteng in late August 2013. Despite 24-hour veterinary treatment, he died on September 12, 2013. Ms. Nielsen said, \\"It is extremely sad to lose an orangutan that we worked so hard to rehabilitate and return to the wild, but we were always realistic from the start that not all of our orangutans would make it ‚Äì even wild orangutans die in the forest to illness or injuries.\\"http://orangutan.or.id/circle-of-life-in-batikap/?lang=EN To coincide with the 68th anniversary of Indonesia's independence, a group of 18 orangutans were released into Bukit Batikap Conservation Forest on August 16 and 17, 2013. Among that group was Bule, who became the third animal from Orangutan Island to be released back to the wild.http://goingback2dforest.wordpress.com/2013/08/16/press-release-happy- independence-day-orangutans/ At the end of November 2013, two more of Orangutan Island's inhabitants were released.http://orangutan.or.id/day-2-the- journey-of-8-orangutans-reintroduced-into-bukit-batikap/ The following day, Bertha went to her new home in the forest.http://orangutan.or.id/day-3-the- return-of-9-orangutans-to-bukit-batikap-and-3-cross-province-orangutan- release-candidates/ Some orangutans shown on the program have died since the series concluded, before they could be released to the wild. According to Lone Dr√∏scher Nielsen's Facebook page, these orangutans have died:https://www.facebook.com/lonedroscher/ * Cha Cha - died of blood poisoning in 2010. * Chen Chen - possibly injured in a fight with another orangutan and found dead in the water in 2010. * Jordan - died of unspecified causes in 2011. * Nadi - died of an unspecified illness in 2010. * Saturnus - died of blood poisoning in 2010.

J., Costanzo Giuseppe (Author), Beschi S. J., Fr Costanzo Giuseppe (Author), Veeramamunivar (Author), Dominic Raj M (Translator), Marudanayagam P (Introduction) in Tamil)http://jamessundarchithambaram.blogspot.sg/2009/07/research-on-beschis- tembavani.html (A Garland of Unfading Honey-Sweet Verses), one of the Tamil classics, a poetical work of Veeramamunivar (Costanzo Beschi), on the life of St.Joseph, the earthly father of Jesus Christ. This Tamil Divine Comedy is divided into thirty-six cantos, containing 3,615 stanzas. \\"It is,\\" says Baumgartner, \\"the noblest epic poem in honour of St. Joseph written in any literature, East or West\\". It begins with the birth of Joseph and ends with his \\"coronation\\" by the Triune God in heavenly glory.  The Story  A staunch ascetic called Valan (Joseph) marries a resolute virgin called Mary. To them ‚Äòa child is born‚Äô, to them ‚Äòa son is given‚Äô, through Divine intervention. How that holy family plays its role in the Divine Drama ‚Äì or if we may call it Tiruvi·∏∑aiyƒÅ·π≠al (Divine Play) as Tamils would call it, or La Divina Commedia as Dante would have it or Divine Providence as the Catholic Church would like to proclaim it ‚Äí is the burden of the epic. Thembavani has more than 100 references to events and teachings in the Bible. Thoroughly immersed in Tamil literature and culture, Beschi integrates several literary devices successfully employed by classics such as Kamba Ramayanam and Manimekalai. This is particularly evident in his description of a landscape, mountain, sea, desert and fertile land, and other epic features of major Tamil epics.  Constanzo Beschi  Beschi occupies a special place in Tamil literature. In fact, the fifth world Tamil Congress held at Madurai in January 1981 acknowledged it by erecting his statue in the city of Madras along with others who have made similar contributions. Beschi composed three Tamil grammars and three dictionaries, Tamil-Latin, Tamil-Portuguese and Tamil- Tamil. His magnum opus, the Thembavani is considered by experts to this day as one of the best Tamil works ever written. Costanzo Giuseppe Beschi was born in the town of Castiglione Delle Stiviere in the district of Mantua, in Italy, on 8 November 1680. He finished his secondary education at the Jesuit School in Montero where the three subjects of rhetoric, humanities and grammar were taught. Desiring to become a priest, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1698 and studied philosophy for three years from 1701‚Äì1703 in Bologna, and theology for four years from 1706‚Äì1710. He was ordained priest in 1709. His studies included not only philosophy and religion but also the learning of languages like Latin, French, Portuguese, Greek, and Hebrew. On hearing about the work done in India by the Jesuits returning to Italy from India, Beschi was eager to come to India. He was sent by his superiors to India in 1710 and landed in Goa and then came to join the Madurai Province of the Jesuits. Though he was given priestly duties in plenty which involved a lot of travelling, he passionately followed his desire to master the local language, literature and culture. He studied Sanskrit, Tamil as well as Telugu from pundits. He gained mastery in Tamil and because of his boldness in defending the correctness of his convictions, he was fondly called by people as Dhairiyanathar (The Fearless Guru). His magnum opus Thembavani was presented for ratification as a classic in the Academy of Poets and received their approval and the poet was given the title Veeramanunivar (The Courageous Ascetic)  The Dante of the Tamil Language  A tablet was installed in his native place Castiglione delle Stiviere in 1980 to mark the 300th birth anniversary of Beschi. In it, it is mentioned that Beschi is called the Dante of the Tamil language.  Thembavani  Beschi composed the epic keeping Joseph (Valan) as the hero and Mary as the heroine and wove into it several characters and episodes appropriate to the unravelling on the story of Joseph, Mary and their God-son. The epic consists of 3,615 rhymed quatrains in Tamil with 90 variations, and it has been translated by M. Dominic Raj into English in unrhymed quatrains of free verse following the ‚ÄòSprung Rhythm‚Äô style of Hopkins. It consists of 3 Parts with 12 sections in each. There are 356 episodes that relate to births, deaths, journeys, wars, celebrations, happenings in the Netherworld, Hell, Heaven, etc. It contains philosophical and theological discussions on the nature of God, idolatry, rebirth, Fate, virtue, asceticism, etc. It has an abundance of historical, biblical and fictional characters like Moses, Joshua, Gideon, Joseph of Old Testament, Samson, David and Goliath, Nebuchadnezzar, Tobit and Tobias, John the Baptist, Herod, Kunnan, Navakan, Surami, etc. Its actions take place in several places like Bethlehem, Judea, Nazareth, Egypt, Heliopolis, Gaza, Jericho, Sinai, Beersheba, etc. Kings from the Holy Roman Empire (England, Ireland, Spain, Gaul, Prussia, Norway, Lusitania, Genoa, Etruria, Parthia, Cyprus, Paeonia) come to Vienna at the invitation of Leopold I to install the statue of the hero of the epic (Joseph). Thus ends the epic. Thembavani is regarded by Prof. Alexander Beecroft of the University of South Carolina as one of the seven World Classics that are yet to be translated into English from their native languages. He places Thembavani as the third in the list.  The Structure of Thembavani  The Thembavani was divided into three parts and twelve sub sections.www.thembavani.webs.com = PART ONE (‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ§‡Æ≤‡Ææ‡ÆÆ‡Øç ‡Æï‡Ææ‡Æ£‡Øç‡Æü‡ÆÆ‡Øç) =  One: the country

Dominic Raj  M. Dominic Raj was born on 6 January 1942, at Tiruchirapalli in Tamil Nadu. He completed his schooling at Campion High School in 1958 and his PUC in 1960 at St. Joseph's College, Tiruchirapalli (both run by Jesuits). He completed a three-year course in philosophy in Latin medium at Salesian College, Yercaud when he was with the Salesians of Don Bosco for a few years. After working for five years as a school teacher, he resigned his job and joined M.A (English) course at St. Joseph's College, Tiruchi, and passed it securing the 3rd rank in the undivided University of Madras in 1972. He learnt his English from Fr. Hession S.J. while in school and from Fr. T. N. Sequeira, Fr. Lawrence Sundaram, (Jesuits) and professors P. Marudanayagam, A. Joseph, M.S. Nagarajan and others. He learnt the audacity to criticize even the canons of Philip Sidney, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Arnold and others from Prof. S. Ramasamy, who was engaged by the college to take classes after his retirement from service as Head, Dept. of English, Presidency College. In 1975, he left St. Joseph's College and joined VHNSN College, Virudhunagar as Asst. Prof. of English. In 1981, he completed the Post Graduate Diploma in the Teaching of English course conducted by the Central Institute of English and Foreign Languages, Hyderabad. He obtained his PhD degree in1989 from Madurai Kamaraj University after research on the topic ‚ÄòIndian Contribution to English Literary Criticism‚Äô under the able guidance of Prof. P. Marudanayagam. He retired as Reader and Head of the Department of English, VHNSN College, in 2000. His interest in Tamil Classical Literature came about when he worked as Chief Resource Person, Department of Translation, Central Institute of Classical Tamil, Chennai (from 2009 to 2013). He had to edit the English translations of Classical Tamil Texts (some in verse and some in prose) carried out by some of the highly reputed translators at that time A.K. Ramanujan, Prema Nandakumar, Alain Danielou, J.V. Chellaiah, Nalladi R. Balakrishna Mudaliar, P.N. Appusamy, K.G. Seshadri and several more. After leaving the Institute, thinking of contributing something to Tamil literature, he thought of translating Thembavani which was much talked about but about which no worthwhile scholarly work had been done. In fact, the text itself was not easily available, much less the facts about Beschi's life and his works. It is hoped that through this translation Thembavani will no longer be discarded by the very people for whom it was written and that it will spur the younger generation to engage itself in serious academic work, and that all who read it will enjoy the extraordinary poetic genius of Veeramamunivar and the sweetness of his poetic diction. Now that we have an English translation of Thembavani, and that too in verse, it will be interesting to compare this with the earlier translations in English of select verses by scholars and others. Francis Whyte Ellis (1777-1819), a British Civil Servant, who was Senior member of the Madras College Board, contributed immensely to the spreading of Tamil writings. Luckily, Prof. P. Marudanayagam, in his Introduction, has given us Ellis‚Äô translation of some verses of Thembavani. Elijah Hoole (1798‚Äì1872) was an English orientalist and Wesleyan Methodist missionary. Elijah Hoole, a who himself translated parts of the Bible into Tamil, offers a glimpse into Thembavani, with some selections from the description of Jerusalem in the second canto: \\"There were swarms of contending crocodiles, showing teeth sharp as a sword, and curved like the fair new moon, opening their fleshy mouths, and flashing fire from their eyes, as though the moat had formerly been deepened to hell, and the demons lying there had assumed and wandered about in a terrifying form.\\" = A comparison of his translation with that of M.

It is set in Shanghai and Hong Kong, Republic of China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Reportedly, the short story \\"took Chang more than two decades to complete\\". The 2007 film of the same name by renowned Taiwanese director Ang Lee was an adaptation of this novel. The story focuses on the plight of Wang Chia-chih and her involvement in a plot to assassinate Mr. Yee, who is a co-collaborator of a Chinese collaborator with the invading Japanese force. The novella was allegedly based on a true story of the wartime spy Zheng Pingru. According to David Der-wei Wang, a Professor of Chinese Literature at Harvard University, Lust, Caution ‚Äúdrew controversy thanks to a biographical subtext: it seems to project Chang‚Äôs own wartime experience as a collaborator‚Äôs lover‚Äù.  Original manuscript  In 2008, Hong Kong magazine Muse released an unpublished English manuscript by Eileen Chang, entitled The Spyring or Ch'ing K√™! Ch'ing K√™!, an earlier draft of Lust, Caution.The manuscript was dated as early as the 1950s. According to an article in Southern Metropolis Daily, Chang willed all her possessions to Stephen Soong and his wife Mae Fong Soong in Hong Kong, but they later died. Their daughter Elaine and son Chinese-American translator Roland Soong inherited Chang's literary estate. An online newspaper article in The New York Times reveals that Roland Soong \\"was approached about making a film\\" from Chang's Lust, Caution upon returning to Hong Kong in 2003. Soong decided to release the manuscript when the 2007 film adaptation hit the cinemas. The title of the work eventually adopted, Lust, Caution, is a pun. The character for \\"lust\\" (Ëâ≤, s√®) can be read as \\"colour\\", while \\"caution\\" (Êàí, ji√®) can be read as \\"ring\\", therefore the title can also read as \\"colourful ring\\", an object that plays a pivotal role in the story.  Plot summary  Executed Chinese spy Zheng Pingru, generally believed to be the prototype for Wang Chia-chih During the Japanese occupation of China, Wang Chia-chih (Wang Jiazhi), a young former actress and drama student, along with other radical Cantonese students take on a dangerous mission to disrupt the Wang Jingwei regime. He is the man who will negotiate and collaborate with the invading Japanese forces to form a government in China. The radical group plans to assassinate Mr. Yee (Yi), a co-collaborator of Wang Jingwei. Chia-chih is assigned a role to disguise as the wife of Mr. Mai, a Hong Kong businessman who is made bankrupt with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the fall of Hong Kong. Her task is to seduce Mr. Yee and facilitate the ambush. Initially, the student conspirators plan to assassinate Mr. Yee during his stay in Hong Kong. However, the Yees unexpectedly have to leave for Mainland China. The group is disbanded due to a lack of funds and the low chance of Mr. Yee to be close in proximity. During this period, the female student conspirators denounce Chia-chih as a whore because of her sexual relations with Liang Jun-sheng, who is tasked to train Chia-chih as a seductress. The mission resumes after Wu, a member of the anti- Japanese underground resistance in Shanghai, offers to sponsor its continuation in Shanghai. In Shanghai, Chia-chih becomes a part of Mrs. Yee's regular mahjong group. She seduces Mr. Yee and has a secret affair with him. Throughout their liaison, Chia-chih struggles internally between her personal attachment to Mr. Yee and her task to lure him into an assassination trap. On the day of the impending assassination, Mr. Yee offers to buy Chia-chih a rare diamond ring when they visit a jeweler to replace a gem from one of her earrings. As they wait for the jeweler to prepare a receipt, Chia-chih presumes that Mr. Yee's feelings for her are genuine and agonizes over the thought of the impending assassination. At the last minute, she simply tells him to run, a discreet way of warning him of the impending assassination. He successfully flees. Chia-chih and her fellow conspirators are captured in a blockade and executed on the information given by Mr. Yee. After the execution, Mr. Yee realizes his love for Chia-chih. Nevertheless, he deludes himself that the executions avert rumors of his affair from spreading. The novella ends with him leaving the room filled with the socializing Tai tais.  Characters  = Student radical group and supporters = * Wang Chia-chih / Wang Jia-zhi (a.k.a. Mai Tai-tai): A student actress turned assassin's spy, posing as the Tai-tai (wife) of Mr. Mai, a fictional Hong Kong businessman. Her (Mai Tai-tai) tasks are to befriend Yee Tai Tai and seduce Mr. Yee in order to make his assassination possible. * Au-yeung Ling-man / Ou-yang Ling- wen (a.k.a Mr. Mai): A fictional Hong Kong businessman who is made bankrupt with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and the fall of Hong Kong. His identity as a spy is Mr. Mai. * Kwong Yu-man / K‚Äôuang Yu-Min: The leader of the student conspirators casts as a cousin of the Mai family. From the same region as one of Wang Ching-wei's aides from whom he extracts valuable information about Wang's inner circle. * Wong Leui / Huang Lei:The wealthiest member of the student radical group. Since he is the only member who can drive, he serves as the chauffeur. He initially funds the mission until his father financially cuts him off. * Leung Yeun-sang / Liang Run-Sheng:The only member of the group who has been inside a brothel. He is tasked with training Chia-chih to become a seductress. It is implied that due to his experience, he has sex with Chia- chih to train her to seduce Mr. Yee. * Ng / Wu: An underground revolutionary. A member of the anti-Japanese underground resistance movement -who is based in Shanghai. After knowing of the assassination plot, he offers financial support for its continuation. = The collaborators = * Mr. Yee / Mr. Yi: The husband of Yee Tai Tai and advisor to Wang Ching-wei. Mr. Yee is the object of the political assassination plot. He is seduced by Chia-chih/Mai Tai-tai. * Wang Ching-wei / Wang Jing-wei: Based on the historical figure Wang Jingwei. Wang formed a Chinese collaborationist government in Japanese-occupied Nanking between 1940 and 1944. * Yee Tai Tai / Yi Tai-tai: The wife of Mr. Yee who has a good social position and material wealth. She has a group of female companions and is enamored with Chia-chih's youth. * Ma Tai-tai and Liao Tai- tai: Members of Yee Tai Tai's entourage who are more interested with social status and material things  Themes  Author Eileen Chang = Conformity vs individualism = To conform to the group meant that Chia-Chih has to do what is expected of her. The central figure in the assassination plot, her task is to befriend the Yees and seduce Mr. Yee. She follows her assigned script religiously, without question even when she was ostracized by her female co- conspirator for her alleged sexual encounters. However, Chia-Chih's preference for love over politics serves as defiance of patriotism and nationalism. At the end of the assassination journey, she finds herself in a conflict. She chooses not to betray Mr. Yee. In Julia Lovell's afterword, \\"Chang created for the first time a heroine directly swept up in the radical, patriotic politics of the 1940s, charting her exploitation in the name of nationalism and her impulsive abandonment of the cause for an illusory love.\\" In the story, Chang asserts that individualism should be prioritized over nationalism. According to scholar Yao Sijia, this is a radical notion in comparison to the conventional belief that individuals are subordinate to the nation. = Femme fatale = Lust Caution describes the storyline of Wang Chia-Chih seducing Mr. Yee. Chia-Chih uses her youth and beauty to ensnare Mr. Yee and helps plan for his assassination. The wealthy troupe member, Huang Lei funds the expensive plot where Chia-Chih acts as Mrs. Mak, the spouse of a wealthy businessperson. She initially befriends Yee Tai-Tai, Mr. Yee's wife, to get close to her husband. The two protagonists eventually begin an affair that sets in motion the planned assassination at a jewelry store. Chia-Chih uses her charm to enchant Mr. Yee, a honey-trap technique used in politics. = Love = The sensual attraction between the two protagonists develops into a more profound and dangerous connection. In the jewelry scene, Chia-Chih ponders on whether she had fallen in love with Mr. Yee. She informs him of the imminent ambush, and Mr. Yee dodges the attack. It is conceivable that his demise would trouble Chia-Chih. Mr.Yee contends that she loved him but signs her execution to avoid inquiries into his life and protect his reputation. In the novella, lust plays a vital role in depicting love as a commodity that is easily exchangeable and disposable. = Materialism = Chang uses both dialogue and detailed narrations of extravagance to explore materialism. For example, the affluent characters use golden chains to tie their cloaks. The author chooses precious chains to portray the desire to flaunt wealth. Mr. Yee decides to buy a diamond ring for Chia-Chih instead of a gem for her earrings. The appeal of the ring is vanity and mirrors Chia-Chih's perception of love that leaves her crushed. In addition, the description of feminine dresses, jewels, and a luxurious curtain in Mr. Yee's residence are all symbols of wealth and power in a war-stricken nation.  Writing style  Lust, Caution can be categorized as a roman √† clef in which elements of Chang's life and emotions are integrated into the novel. Wang Chia-Chih's romantic fallacy parallels Chang's relationship with her first husband Hu Lan-cheng who was denounced as a traitor for serving a propaganda official in the Wang Jingwei regime. Eileen Chang uses an unconventional narrative technique in Lust, Caution. It is written in the third person interspersed with dialogues. The characters‚Äô inner thoughts are voiced by the narrator. Although those thoughts are introduced abruptly, the readers are able to decipher to whom they belong. According to scholar Nicole Huang, Chang's writing style borrows from the ‚Äúillusory realm between memory and reality, brief moments between past and present, intersections between life and work, fiction and poetry, stage movements and everyday life‚Äù.Nicole Huang, \\"Introduction,\\" in Eileen Chang, Written on Water, translated by Andrew F. Jones (New York: Columbia University Press, 2005), xvi.  English translation  Lust, Caution was first translated into English by Julia Lovell and published in 2007. # Lust, Caution (Ëâ≤ÔºåÊàí). Translated by Julia Lovell. New York: Anchor Books, 2007. .  Adaptations  The adaptation by Ang Lee aroused controversial topic related to sex and nationalism. Peng and Dilly concluded as: ‚ÄúYet even more controversial was the film‚Äôs 'erotic politics': the torrid sex between the female spy and the collaborator, only vaguely implied in Chang‚Äôs story, was turned into three explicit sex scenes with accompanying visual and visceral effects; the female protagonist‚Äôs full frontal nudity touched off a raging inferno of internet criticism in China.‚Äù  References  Category:1979 American novels Category:Chinese historical novels Category:Chinese novellas Category:Chinese novels adapted into films Category:Novels by Eileen Chang Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Novels set in Shanghai Category:American novels adapted into films ","title":"Lust, Caution (novella)"},{"id":"13640658","text":"is a train station of West Japan Railway Company (JR-West) in Iga, Mie, Japan.

It is a very common Jewish surname, and the following information discusses only that origin. The Suleiman ben Pinhas Cohen family of Sana'a, circa 1944 Bearing the surname often (although not always) indicates that one's patrilineal ancestors were priests in the Temple of Jerusalem. A single such priest was known as a Kohen, and the hereditary caste descending from these priests is collectively known as the Kohanim. As multiple languages were acquired through the Jewish diaspora, the surname acquired dozens of variants. Not all persons with related surnames are kohanim, and not all kohanim have related surnames. Some Kohanim have added a secondary appellation to their surname, so as to distinguish themselves from other Kohanim‚Äîsuch as Cohen- Scali of Morocco, who trace their lineage to Zadok,Shlomo bar Yosef ha-Cohen Atzvan, Ma'alot Shlomo, Jerusalem 1985, p. 56 in PDF (Hebrew) and Cohen- Maghari (Meguri) of Yemen, who trace their lineage to the first ward, Jehoiariv, in the division of twenty-four priestly wards. Being a Kohen imposes some limitations: by Jewish law a Kohen may not marry a divorced woman, and may not marry a proselyte (someone who converted to Judaism).Donin p.291 Nor should an observant Kohen come into contact with the deadDonin p.304 or enter a cemetery. An effort to trace whether people named 'Cohen' actually have a common genetic origin has been undertaken, using a genealogical DNA test associated with the Cohen Modal Haplotype.Sources for the genetic studies are given in the article Y-chromosomal Aaron. Katz The Katz surname is a possible indicator of being a Kohen/Cohen: it may stem from \\"Kohen Tzedek\\". The latter word means \\"righteous or authentic priest.\\" Other last names with similar indication are Kohentov and Kohenteb; the suffix literally means good, meaning that one could rely on them as being a Kohen when needing one for redeeming a firstborn male child.

Kocs was the Hungarian post town in the 15th century onwards, which gave its name to a fast light vehicle, which later spread across Europe. Therefore, the English word coach, the Spanish and Portuguese coche, the German Kutsche, and the Slovak koƒç and Czech koƒç√°r all probably derive from the Hungarian word \\"kocsi\\", literally meaning \\"of Kocs\\".Definition \\"coach\\" in Merriam-Webster Dictionary. It was not until 1580, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, that coaches were introduced to England. These were designed to be pulled by a pair of horses. In 1619 George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham introduced the coach and six horses.The Book of Days by robert Chambers Coaches were reputedly introduced into England from France by Henry FitzAlan, 19th Earl of Arundel. A coach with four horses is a coach-and-four.Definition of coach-and-four by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. Free access. A coach together with the horses, harness and attendants is a turnout.Turn out ‚Äì Definition from the Merriam- Webster Online Dictionary. The bodies of early coaches were hung on leather straps. In the eighteenth century steel springs were also used in suspension systems. An advertisement in the Edinburgh Courant for 1754 reads: > The Edinburgh stage-coach, for the better accommodation of passengers, will > be altered to a new genteel two-end glass coach-machine, hung on steel > springs, exceedingly light and easy... Strap suspensions persisted, however; the 19th century American Concord coaches used leather straps exactly as the first Berline from 1660 did. A coach might have a built-in compartment called a boot, used originally as a seat for the coachman and later for storage. A luggage case for the top of a coach was called an imperial; the top, roof or second-story compartment of a coach was also known as an imperial.Definition of imperial by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. Free access. The front and rear axles were connected by a main shaft called the perch or reach. A crossbar known as a splinter bar supported the springs. Coaches were often decorated by painters using a sable brush called a liner. In the 19th century the name coach was used for U.S. railway carriages,Oxford English Dictionary and in the 20th century to motor coaches. See John Taylor (poet) for a very adverse opinion of the arrival of horsedrawn coaches in England.

He was also called a jarvey or jarvie, especially in Ireland. If he drove dangerously fast or recklessly he was a jehu (from Jehu, king of Israel, who was noted for his furious attacks in a chariot (2 Kings 9:20), or a Phaeton (from Greek Phaethon, son of Helios, who attempted to drive the chariot of the sun but managed to set the earth on fire). A postilion or postillion sometimes rode as a guide on the near horse of a pair or of one of the pairs attached to a coach, especially when there was no coachman. A guard on a horse-drawn coach was called a shooter. Traveling by coach, or pleasure driving in a coach, as in a tally-ho, was called coaching. In driving a coach, the coachman used a coachwhip, usually provided with a long lash. Experienced coachmen never used the lash on their horses. They used the whip to flick the ear of the leader to give them the office to move on, or cracked it next to their heads to request increased speed. *box coat: a heavy overcoat with or without shoulder capes used by coachmen (riding on the box seat) exposed to all kinds of weather.Box Coat. Probert Encyclopaedia. *hammercloth: ornamented and often fringed was hung over the coachman's seat, especially on a ceremonial coach.Hammercloth in Merriam-Webster Unabridged Dictionary (2000). * cockhorse: An extra horse led behind a coach to be hitched when passing over steep or difficult terrain. * stable was a building to shelter horses usually close to the owner's house. Staff accommodation would be close often within the same building. * coach house was a special building for sheltering a coach or coaches but coaches were more often kept within the stable building. * coaching inn or coaching house provided accommodation for travellers and usually provided a change of horses and offered stabling. *coach dog or carriage dog was trained to run in attendance on a coach particularly Dalmatians. Coach horses A coach horse or coacher bred for drawing a coach is typically heavier and of more compact build than a road horse and exhibits good style and action.Detailed information about specific breeds of horses: Carriage Horses in Britain.

The internal anal sphincter is one of two muscles that comprise the anal sphincter which controls the passage of feces. The procedure helps by lowering the resting pressure of the internal anal sphincter, which improves blood supply to the fissure and allows faster healing. The procedure has been shown to be very effective, with 96% of fissures healing at a median of 3 weeks in one trial.  Indications  Lateral internal sphincterotomy is the preferred method of surgery for persons with chronic anal fissures, and is generally used when medical therapy has failed. It is associated with a lower rate of side effects than older techniques such as posterior internal sphincterotomy and anoplasty, and has also been shown to be superior to topical glyceryl trinitrate (GTN 0.2% ointment) in long term healing of fissures, with no difference in fecal continence.  Surgical technique  Lateral internal sphincterotomy is a minor operation which can be carried out under either local or general anaesthesia; a report in 1981 showed that general anaesthesia is preferable due to high rates of fissure recurrence in patients treated under local anaesthesia. This operation is generally carried out as a day case procedure. It can be performed with either \\"open\\" or \\"closed\\" techniques: * the open technique involves making an incision across the intersphincteric groove, separating the internal sphincter from the anal mucosa by blunt dissection, and dividing the internal sphincter using scissors. * the closed technique or subcutaneous technique involves making a small incision at the intersphincteric groove, inserting a scalpel with the blade parallel to the internal sphincter and advancing it along the intersphincteric groove, and then rotating the scalpel towards the internal sphincter and dividing it. In both techniques the lower one third to one half of the internal sphincter is divided, to lower the resting pressure without destroying the effect of the sphincter. The closed technique results in a smaller wound, but both techniques appear to be similarly effective.  Complications  * Minor fecal incontinence and difficulty controlling flatulence are common side effects following surgery. Persistent minor fecal incontinence has been reported in 1.2% to 3.5% of patients; however, this does not appear to be significantly different to the rate of minor fecal incontinence experienced by patients treated with topical GTN. * Hemorrhage can occur, more often with the open technique, and may require suture ligation. * Perianal abscess occurs in about 1% of closed sphincterotomies, generally in association with anal fistula caused by a breach of the anal mucosa by the scalpel. Incision and drainage of the abscess and fistulotomy are required.

GRBs show an extraordinary degree of diversity. They can last anywhere from a fraction of a second to many minutes. Bursts could have a single profile or oscillate wildly up and down in intensity, and their spectra are highly variable unlike other objects in space. The near complete lack of observational constraint led to a profusion of theories, including evaporating black holes, magnetic flares on white dwarfs, accretion of matter onto neutron stars, antimatter accretion, supernovae, hypernovae, and rapid extraction of rotational energy from supermassive black holes, among others. There are at least two different types of progenitors (sources) of GRBs: one responsible for the long-duration, soft- spectrum bursts and one (or possibly more) responsible for short-duration, hard-spectrum bursts. The progenitors of long GRBs are believed to be massive, low-metallicity stars exploding due to the collapse of their cores. The progenitors of short GRBs are thought to arise from mergers of compact binary systems like neutron stars, which was confirmed by the GW170817 observation of a neutron star merger and a kilonova. Long GRBs: massive stars =Collapsar model= As of 2007, there is almost universal agreement in the astrophysics community that the long-duration bursts are associated with the deaths of massive stars in a specific kind of supernova-like event commonly referred to as a collapsar or hypernova. Very massive stars are able to fuse material in their centers all the way to iron, at which point a star cannot continue to generate energy by fusion and collapses, in this case, immediately forming a black hole. Matter from the star around the core rains down towards the center and (for rapidly rotating stars) swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into the black hole drives a pair of jets out along the rotational axis, where the matter density is much lower than in the accretion disk, towards the poles of the star at velocities approaching the speed of light, creating a relativistic shock wave at the front. If the star is not surrounded by a thick, diffuse hydrogen envelope, the jets' material can pummel all the way to the stellar surface. The leading shock actually accelerates as the density of the stellar matter it travels through decreases, and by the time it reaches the surface of the star it may be traveling with a Lorentz factor of 100 or higher (that is, a velocity of 0.9999 times the speed of light). Once it reaches the surface, the shock wave breaks out into space, with much of its energy released in the form of gamma- rays. Three very special conditions are required for a star to evolve all the way to a gamma-ray burst under this theory: the star must be very massive (probably at least 40 Solar masses on the main sequence) to form a central black hole in the first place, the star must be rapidly rotating to develop an accretion torus capable of launching jets, and the star must have low metallicity in order to strip off its hydrogen envelope so the jets can reach the surface. As a result, gamma-ray bursts are far rarer than ordinary core- collapse supernovae, which only require that the star be massive enough to fuse all the way to iron. =Evidence for the collapsar view= This consensus is based largely on two lines of evidence. First, long gamma-ray bursts are found without exception in systems with abundant recent star formation, such as in irregular galaxies and in the arms of spiral galaxies. This is strong evidence of a link to massive stars, which evolve and die within a few hundred million years and are never found in regions where star formation has long ceased. This does not necessarily prove the collapsar model (other models also predict an association with star formation) but does provide significant support. Second, there are now several observed cases where a supernova has immediately followed a gamma-ray burst. While most GRBs occur too far away for current instruments to have any chance of detecting the relatively faint emission from a supernova at that distance, for lower-redshift systems there are several well-documented cases where a GRB was followed within a few days by the appearance of a supernova. These supernovae that have been successfully classified are type Ib/c, a rare class of supernova caused by core collapse. Type Ib and Ic supernovae lack hydrogen absorption lines, consistent with the theoretical prediction of stars that have lost their hydrogen envelope. The GRBs with the most obvious supernova signatures include GRB 060218 (SN 2006aj), GRB 030329 (SN 2003dh), and GRB 980425 (SN 1998bw), and a handful of more distant GRBs show supernova \\"bumps\\" in their afterglow light curves at late times. Possible challenges to this theory emerged recently, with the discovery of two nearby long gamma-ray bursts that lacked the signature of any type of supernova: both GRB060614 and GRB 060505 defied predictions that a supernova would emerge despite intense scrutiny from ground-based telescopes. Both events were, however, associated with actively star-forming stellar populations. One possible explanation is that during the core collapse of a very massive star a black hole can form, which then 'swallows' the entire star before the supernova blast can reach the surface. Short GRBs: degenerate binary systems Short gamma-ray bursts appear to be an exception. Until 2007, only a handful of these events have been localized to a definite galactic host. However, those that have been localized appear to show significant differences from the long-burst population. While at least one short burst has been found in the star-forming central region of a galaxy, several others have been associated with the outer regions and even the outer halo of large elliptical galaxies in which star formation has nearly ceased. All the hosts identified so far have also been at low redshift. Furthermore, despite the relatively nearby distances and detailed follow-up study for these events, no supernova has been associated with any short GRB. =Neutron star and neutron star/black hole mergers= While the astrophysical community has yet to settle on a single, universally favored model for the progenitors of short GRBs, the generally preferred model is the merger of two compact objects as a result of gravitational inspiral: two neutron stars, or a neutron star and a black hole. While thought to be rare in the Universe, a small number of cases of close neutron star - neutron star binaries are known in our Galaxy, and neutron star - black hole binaries are believed to exist as well. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, systems of this nature will slowly lose energy due to gravitational radiation and the two degenerate objects will spiral closer and closer together, until in the last few moments, tidal forces rip the neutron star (or stars) apart and an immense amount of energy is liberated before the matter plunges into a single black hole. The whole process is believed to occur extremely quickly and be completely over within a few seconds, accounting for the short nature of these bursts. Unlike long-duration bursts, there is no conventional star to explode and therefore no supernova. This model has been well-supported so far by the distribution of short GRB host galaxies, which have been observed in old galaxies with no star formation (for example, GRB050509B, the first short burst to be localized to a probable host) as well as in galaxies with star formation still occurring (such as GRB050709, the second), as even younger-looking galaxies can have significant populations of old stars. However, the picture is clouded somewhat by the observation of X-ray flaring in short GRBs out to very late times (up to many days), long after the merger should have been completed, and the failure to find nearby hosts of any sort for some short GRBs. =Magnetar giant flares= One final possible model that may describe a small subset of short GRBs are the so-called magnetar giant flares (also called megaflares or hyperflares). Early high-energy satellites discovered a small population of objects in the Galactic plane that frequently produced repeated bursts of soft gamma-rays and hard X-rays. Because these sources repeat and because the explosions have very soft (generally thermal) high-energy spectra, they were quickly realized to be a separate class of object from normal gamma-ray bursts and excluded from subsequent GRB studies. However, on rare occasions these objects, now believed to be extremely magnetized neutron stars and sometimes termed magnetars, are capable of producing extremely luminous outbursts. The most powerful such event observed to date, the giant flare of 27 December 2004, originated from the magnetar SGR 1806-20 and was bright enough to saturate the detectors of every gamma-ray satellite in orbit and significantly disrupted Earth's ionosphere.Hurley et al., 2005. Nature v.434 p.1098, \\"An exceptionally bright flare from SGR 1806-20 and the origins of short-duration gamma-ray bursts\\" While still significantly less luminous than \\"normal\\" gamma-ray bursts (short or long), such an event would be detectable to current spacecraft from galaxies as far as the Virgo cluster and, at this distance, would be difficult to distinguish from other types of short gamma-ray burst on the basis of the light curve alone. To date, three gamma-ray bursts have been associated with SGR flares in galaxies beyond the Milky Way: GRB 790305b in the Large Magellanic Cloud, GRB 051103 from M81 and GRB 070201 from M31.Frederiks 2008 Diversity in the origin of long GRBs HETE II and Swift observations reveal that long gamma-ray bursts come with and without supernovae, and with and without pronounced X-ray afterglows. It gives a clue to a diversity in the origin of long GRBs, possibly in- and outside of star-forming regions, with otherwise a common inner engine. The timescale of tens of seconds of long GRBs hereby appears to be intrinsic to their inner engine, for example, associated with a viscous or a dissipative process. The most powerful stellar mass transient sources are the above-mentioned progenitors (collapsars and mergers of compact objects), all producing rotating black holes surrounded by debris in the form of an accretion disk or torus. A rotating black hole carries spin- energy in angular momentum as does a spinning top: : E_{spin} = \\\\frac{1}{2} I \\\\Omega_H^2 where I=4M^3(\\\\cos(\\\\lambda/2)/\\\\cos(\\\\lambda/4))^2 and \\\\Omega_H=(1/2M)\\\\tan(\\\\lambda/2) denote the moment of inertia and the angular velocity of the black hole in the trigonometric expression \\\\sin\\\\lambda=a/M van Putten, M.H.P.M., 1999, Science, 284, 115 for the specific angular momentum a of a Kerr black hole of mass M. With no small parameter present, it has been well-recognized that the spin energy of a Kerr black hole can reach a substantial fraction (29%) of its total mass-energy M, thus holding promise to power the most remarkable transient sources in the sky. Of particular interest are mechanisms for producing non-thermal radiation by the gravitational field of rotating black holes, in the process of spin-down against their surroundings in aforementioned scenarios. By Mach's principle, spacetime is dragged along with mass-energy, with the distant stars on cosmological scales or with a black hole in close proximity. Thus, matter tends to spin-up around rotating black holes, for the same reason that pulsars spin down by shedding angular momentum in radiation to infinity. A major amount of spin-energy of rapidly spinning black holes can hereby be released in a process of viscous spin-down against an inner disk or torus‚Äîinto various emission channels. Spin- down of rapidly spinning stellar mass black holes in their lowest energy state takes tens of seconds against an inner disk, representing the remnant debris of the merger of two neutron stars, the break-up of a neutron star around a companion black hole or formed in core-collapse of a massive star. Forced turbulence in the inner disk stimulates the creation of magnetic fields and multipole mass-moments, thereby opening radiation channels in radio, neutrinos and, mostly, in gravitational waves with distinctive chirps shown in the diagram with the creation of astronomical amounts of Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Diagram of van Putten (2009) showing the gravitational radiation produced in binary coalescence of neutron stars with another neutron star or black hole and, post-coalescence or following core-collapse of a massive star, the expected radiation by high-density turbulent matter around stellar mass Kerr black holes. As the ISCO (ellipse) relaxes to that around a slowly rotating, nearly Schwarzschild black hole, the late-time frequency of gravitational radiation provides accurate metrology of the black hole mass. Transparency of matter to gravitational waves offers a new probe to the inner- most workings of supernovae and GRBs. The gravitational-wave observatories LIGO and Virgo are designed to probe stellar mass transients in a frequency range of tens to about fifteen hundred Hz. The above-mentioned gravitational- wave emissions fall well within the LIGO-Virgo bandwidth of sensitivity; for long GRBs powered by \\"naked inner engines\\" produced in the binary merger of a neutron star with another neutron star or companion black hole, the above- mentioned magnetic disk winds dissipate into long-duration radio-bursts, that may be observed by the novel Low Frequency Array (LOFAR).

Life Edward Allde was part of a family of professional printers: his father John, his mother Margaret, his widow Elizabeth, and two of her children all worked in the trade. Edward Allde took over the business of his father on the elder Allde's death in 1584; he became a \\"freeman\\" (a full member) of the Stationers Company in February of that year, \\"by patrimony.\\" The son continued his father's practices and publications; John Allde, for example, had issued the undated first quarto of Thomas Preston's play Cambyses sometime before 1584; Edward Allde issued the undated second quarto of the same play, sometime after 1584.

Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 317, 470. At first, Edward ran his late father's business with the help of his mother; it was located at the Long Shop in the Poultry, adjoining St. Mildred's Church (and four doors away from a London prison, the Poultry Counter; the prison's stocks were outside the Allde shop door). In 1593, Edward moved into his own establishment, at the sign of the Gilded Cup in Fore Street, Cripplegate, near the Barbican; Margaret Allde continued the Long Shop operation on her own, at least until 1601.Elizabeth Lane Furdell, Publishing and Medicine in Early Modern England, Rochester, NY, University of Rochester Press, 2002; p. 105.

Toward the end of his career, in the early 1620s, Allde was involved in the syndicate that produced the first English newspapers, along with Nathaniel Butter, Thomas Archer, Nicholas Bourne, William Sheffard and Bartholomew Downes. While his output was massive and significant, Allde's craftsmanship has not been rated highly by modern scholars, critics, and bibliographers. In the succinct verdict of one commentator, \\"his work was poor.\\"F. E. Halliday, A Shakespeare Companion 1564‚Äì1964, Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 27. It was not unusual, in this period, for stationers to run into difficulties with the authorities, both those of their guild and the higher civil administration; most were fined for infractions large and small, and some, like Butter, Archer, Nicholas Okes, and William Stansby, were imprisoned. John Allde spent time in the Poultry Compter in 1568 for printing a pro-Catholic text. (Both the Tudor and Stuart regimes were serious about censorship and control of the press.) Edward Allde ran into the same types of troubles in his career: he was fined for printing unregistered works and works to which he did not own the copyright; his presses were shut down twice, and he was once sent to prison by the Secretary of State. In 1623, he admitted to Company officials to \\"behaving my self turbulently and disorderly...and using unseemly and unfitting words....\\"H. S. Bassett, English Books and Readers, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1990; p. 56. Shakespeare Edward Allde printed key texts of the original Shakespearean bibliography: * Part of the first quarto, the \\"bad quarto,\\" of Romeo and Juliet (1597), for publisher Cuthbert Burby. * The third quarto of Titus Andronicus (1611), for Edward White. * The second edition of Robert Chester's Love's Martyr (1611), which contained Shakespeare's The Phoenix and the Turtle, for Matthew Lownes. (Lownes re-titled the book The Annuals of Great Britain.) Allde shared the printing of Romeo and Juliet Q1 with colleague John Danter, apparently with the goal of a speedy result. Danter printed sheets A through D, while Allde printed sheets E through K. Only Danter, however, is credited on the volume's title page.Lukas Erne, ed., The First Quarto of Romeo and Juliet, The New Cambridge Shakespeare: The Early Quartos; Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2007; p. 37. Bibliographers determined Allde's participation in Romeo and Juliet in part by tracking damaged type used in Allde's E-K sheets and in three books that he printed in the 1597‚Äì9 period.Standish Henning, \\"The Printer of Romeo and Juliet, Q1, Publications of the Bibliographical Society of America 60 (1966), pp. 363‚Äì4. Others Beyond the limits of the Shakespearean canon, Edward Allde printed important first editions of plays: * Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy (undated; 1592?), for Edward White; * Christopher Marlowe's The Massacre at Paris (undated; 1594?), again for White; * George Peele's The Battle of Alcazar (1594), for Richard Bankworth; * the first and second editions of Samuel Daniel's Cleopatra (1594, 1595) conjointly with printer James Roberts, for publisher Simon Waterson; * the first two editions of the anonymous Soliman and Persida (both 1599), again for White; * Thomas Dekker's Satiromastix (1602), yet again for White; * Daniel's masque The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses (1604); * Edward Sharpham's Cupid's Whirligig (1607), for Arthur Johnson; * Thomas Middleton's The Phoenix (1607), for Arthur Johnson; * the anonymous Every Woman in Her Humour (1609), for Thomas Archer; * John Mason's The Turk (1610), for John Busby; * Philip Massinger's The Bondman (1624), for John Harrison and Edward Blackmore; ‚Äî; among others. (Allde's habit of issuing undated books has been a nuisance for modern scholars.) Allde naturally printed plays in other than first editions too ‚Äî; like the second edition of Norton and Sackville's Gorboduc (1590), for John Perrin, and a 1606 edition of Marlowe's Tamburlaine, Part 2 for Edward White. Allde maintained a long-term professional relationship with bookseller White, and printed a number of dramatic and non-dramatic works for him over the course of their careers. Of course, Allde also printed a wide variety of non-dramatic works of virtually all types then in circulation. He worked on a few of the pamphlets of Samuel Rowlands, including The Knave of Clubs (1611) and the evocatively-titled Look to It for I'll Stab Ye (1604). Allde printed topical works like Henry Petowe's Elizabetha Quasi Vivens: Eliza's Funeral (1603), an item in the mourning literature for Queen Elizabeth I. For Cuthbert Burby, Allde printed the sixth volume of The Mirror of Knighthood (1598), the vast, and vastly popular, chivalric romance that was one of the greatest best- sellers of the age. For John Tappe, he printed an early attempt at juvenile literature, Nicholas Breton's The Passionate Shepherd...With many excellent conceited Poems and pleasant Sonnets, fit for young heads to pass away idle hours (1604). Among musical works he printed was John Amner's Sacred Hymnes of 3, 4, 5 and 6 parts for Voyces and Vyols (1615). He also printed the Thomas Ravenscroft's A Briefe Discourse (1614), a music theory treatise. Though his name appeared on a list of those granted monopolies to print set songs under James I, he seems to have used this privilege seldom. Publishing Like most printers of his era, Edward Allde concentrated on printing, and left publishing decisions to the booksellers who commissioned printers to print books. Yet again like most printers of his era, Allde did a certain amount of publishing himself; the editions of Cambyses, Like Will to Like, and The Vision of the Twelve Goddesses mentioned above are examples. As with his printing, Allde published a range of works of various types: he issued the tracts and pamphlets that were so common in his period, like the third edition of William Baldwin's Beware the Cat (1584); and he published serious works, like a Latin vocabulary by John Posselius (1623). Printers who published usually had to arrange with booksellers for the retail distribution of their products. Allde's edition of Richard Rich's News from Virginia: The Lost Flock Triumphant (1610) reads \\"to be sold by John Wright\\" on its title page. Allde's 1607 edition of Gervase Markham's The English Arcadia was sold by Henry Rocket. Wife Allde's widow Elizabeth continued his business from his 1628 death until 1633. Since both Elizabeth and Edward Allde identified themselves on title pages as \\"E. A.\\" or \\"E. Allde,\\" 19th-century scholars sometimes confused their works. Her most significant work in drama may be the first quarto of Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part 2 (1630), which she printed for Nathaniel Butter. She printed the third edition of the anonymous comedy Wily Beguiled (1630) for Thomas Knight. Elizabeth Allde published and printed the second edition of Robert Greene's Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay (1630) and the third edition of Arden of Faversham (1633), one of the plays of the Shakespeare Apocrypha. Elizabeth Allde also produced non-dramatic works. Some examples: she printed William Prynne's Anti-Arminianism (1630) for Michael Sparke, and Clement Cotton's The Mirror of Martyrs (1631) for Robert Allot. She published and printed a collection of the works of Sallust (1629), and Thomas Chaffinger's The Just Man's Memorial (1630). She was one of the four printers who worked on the 1630 collected edition of the works of John Taylor the Water Poet for publisher James Boler. And she also printed ballads, as her husband had done. In 1633, the Allde firm passed to Richard Oulton (or Olton), Elizabeth's son-in-law. Oulton maintained his business, in Newgate Street near Christ Church, until 1643.Henry Robert Plomer, A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers Who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland from 1641 to 1667, The Bibliographical Society/Blades, East & Blades, 1907; p. 142.

The resulting ratio, Fmax, is then compared to a critical value from a table of the sampling distribution of Fmax.David (1952)Pearson & Hartley (1970), Table 31 If the computed ratio is less than the critical value, the groups are assumed to have similar or equal variances.

In humans, ERŒ≤ is encoded by the ESR2 gene. Function ERŒ≤ is a member of the family of estrogen receptors and the superfamily of nuclear receptor transcription factors. The gene product contains an N-terminal DNA binding domain and C-terminal ligand binding domain and is localized to the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. Upon binding to 17-Œ≤-estradiol, estriol or related ligands, the encoded protein forms homo-dimers or hetero-dimers with estrogen receptor Œ± that interact with specific DNA sequences to activate transcription. Some isoforms dominantly inhibit the activity of other estrogen receptor family members. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants of this gene have been described, but the full-length nature of some of these variants has not been fully characterized. ERŒ≤ may have anti-proliferative effects and therefore oppose the actions of ERŒ± in reproductive tissue. ERŒ≤ may also have an important role in adaptive function of the lung during pregnancy. ERŒ≤ is a potent tumor suppressor and plays a crucial role in many cancer types such as prostate cancer. =Mammary gland= ERŒ≤ knockout mice show normal mammary gland development at puberty and are able to lactate normally. The mammary glands of adult virgin female mice are indistinguishable from those of age- matched wild-type virgin female mice. This is in contrast to ERŒ± knockout mice, in which a complete absence of mammary gland development at puberty and thereafter is observed. Administration of the selective ERŒ≤ agonist ERB-041 to immature ovariectomized female rats produced no observable effects in the mammary glands, further indicating that the ERŒ≤ is non-mammotrophic. Although ERŒ≤ is not required for pubertal development of the mammary glands, it may be involved in terminal differentiation in pregnancy, and may also be necessary to maintain the organization and differentiation of mammary epithelium in adulthood. In old female ERŒ≤ knockout mice, severe cystic mammary disease that is similar in appearance to postmenopausal mastopathy develops, whereas this does not occur in aged wild-type female mice. However, ERŒ≤ knockout mice are not only deficient in ERŒ≤ signaling in the mammary glands, but also have deficient progesterone exposure due to impairment of corpora lutea formation. This complicates attribution of the preceding findings to mammary ERŒ≤ signaling. Selective ERŒ≤ agonism with diarylpropionitrile (DPN) has been found to counteract the proliferative effects in the mammary glands of selective ERŒ± agonism with propylpyrazoletriol (PPT) in ovariectomized postmenopausal female rats.Song, X. (2014). Estrogen Receptor Beta Is A Negative Regulator Of Mammary Cell Proliferation. Graduate College Dissertations and Theses. 259. https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/graddis/259 Similarly, overexpression of ERŒ≤ via lentiviral infection in mature virgin female rats decreases mammary proliferation. ERŒ± signaling has proliferative effects in both normal breast and breast cancer cell lines, whereas ERŒ≤ has generally antiproliferative effects in such cell lines. However, ERŒ≤ has been found to have proliferative effects in some breast cell lines. Expression of ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ in the mammary gland have been found to vary throughout the menstrual cycle and in an ovariectomized state in female rats. Whereas mammary ERŒ± in rhesus macaques is downregulated in response to increased estradiol levels, expression of ERŒ≤ in the mammary glands is not. Expression of ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ in the mammary glands also differs throughout life in female mice. Mammary ERŒ± expression is higher and mammary ERŒ≤ expression lower in younger female mice, while mammary ERŒ± expression is lower and mammary ERŒ≤ expression higher in older female mice as well as in parous female mice. Mammary proliferation and estrogen sensitivity is higher in young female mice than in old or parous female mice, particularly during pubertal mammary gland development. Tissue distribution ERŒ≤ is expressed by many tissues including the uterus, blood monocytes and tissue macrophages, colonic and pulmonary epithelial cells and in prostatic epithelium and in malignant counterparts of these tissues. Also, ERŒ≤ is found throughout the brain at different concentrations in different neuron clusters. ERŒ≤ is also highly expressed in normal breast epithelium, although its expression declines with cancer progression. ERŒ≤ is expressed in all subtypes of breast cancer. Controversy regarding ERŒ≤ protein expression has hindered study of ERŒ≤, but highly sensitive monoclonal antibodies have been produced and well-validated to address these issues. ERŒ≤ abnormalities ERŒ≤ function is related to various cardiovascular targets including ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA-1). Polymorphism may affect ERŒ≤ function and lead to altered responses in postmenopausal women receiving hormone replacement therapy. Abnormalities in gene expression associated with ERŒ≤ have also been linked to autism spectrum disorder. Disease =Cardiovascular disease= Mutations in ERŒ≤ have been shown to influence cardiomyocytes, the cells that comprise the largest part of the heart, and can lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is a disparity in prevalence of CVD between pre- and post-menopausal women, and the difference can be attributed to estrogen levels. Many types of ERŒ≤ receptors exist in order to help regulate gene expression and subsequent health in the body, but binding of 17Œ≤E2 (a naturally occurring estrogen) specifically improves cardiac metabolism. The heart utilizes a lot of energy in the form of ATP to properly pump blood and maintain physiological requirements in order to live, and 17Œ≤E2 helps by increasing these myocardial ATP levels and respiratory function. In addition, 17Œ≤E2 can alter myocardial signaling pathways and stimulate myocyte regeneration, which can aid in inhibiting myocyte cell death. The ERŒ≤ signaling pathway plays a role in both vasodilation and arterial dilation, which contributes to an individual having a healthy heart rate and a decrease in blood pressure. This regulation can increase endothelial function and arterial perfusion, both of which are important to myocyte health. Thus, alterations in this signaling pathways due to ERŒ≤ mutation could lead to myocyte cell death from physiological stress. While ERŒ± has a more profound role in regeneration after myocyte cell death, ERŒ≤ can still help by increasing endothelial progenitor cell activation and subsequent cardiac function. =Alzheimer's disease= Genetic variation in ERŒ≤ is both sex and age dependent and ERŒ≤ polymorphism can lead to accelerated brain aging, cognitive impairment, and development of AD pathology. Similar to CVD, post-menopausal women have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to a loss of estrogen, which affects proper aging of the hippocampus, neural survival and regeneration, and amyloid metabolism. ERŒ≤ mRNA is highly expressed in hippocampal formation, an area of the brain that is associated with memory. This expression contributes to increased neuronal survival and helps protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. The pathology of AD is also associated with accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (AŒ≤). While a proper concentration of AŒ≤ in the brain is important for healthy functioning, too much can lead to cognitive impairment. Thus, ERŒ≤ helps control AŒ≤ levels by maintaining the protein it is derived from, Œ≤-amyloid precursor protein. ERŒ≤ helps by up-regulating insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), which leads to Œ≤-amyloid degradation when accumulation levels begin to rise. However, in AD, lack of ERŒ≤ causes a decrease in this degradation and an increase in plaque build-up. ERŒ≤ also plays a role in regulating APOE, a risk factor for AD that redistributes lipids across cells. APOE expression in the hippocampus is specifically regulated by 17Œ≤E2, affecting learning and memory in individuals afflicted with AD. Thus, estrogen therapy via an ERŒ≤-targeted approach can be used as a prevention method for AD either before or at the onset of menopause. Interactions between ERŒ± and ERŒ≤ can lead to antagonistic actions in the brain, so an ERŒ≤-targeted approach can increase therapeutic neural responses independently of ERŒ±. Therapeutically, ERŒ≤ can be used in both men and women in order to regulate plaque formation in the brain. Neuroprotective benefits =Synaptic strength and plasticity= ERŒ≤ levels can dictate both synaptic strength and neuroplasticity through neural structure modifications. Variations in endogenous estrogen levels cause changes in dendritic architecture in the hippocampus, which affects neural signaling and plasticity. Specifically, lower estrogen levels lead to decreased dendritic spines and improper signaling, inhibiting plasticity of the brain. However, treatment of 17Œ≤E2 can reverse this affect, giving it the ability to modify hippocampal structure. As a result of the relationship between dendritic architecture and long-term potentiation (LTP), ERŒ≤ can enhance LTP and lead to an increase in synaptic strength. Furthermore, 17Œ≤E2 promotes neurogenesis in developing hippocampal neurons and neurons in the subventricular zone and dentate gyrus of the adult human brain. Specifically, ERŒ≤ increases the proliferation of progenitor cells to create new neurons and can be increased later in life through 17Œ≤E2 treatment.

It is bisected by the Mwenezi River and the A4 highway, the main thoroughfare that connects the town of Beitbridge, on the border with South Africa, to Masvingo.  Background  Mwenezi derives its name from the Mwenezi River, which provides irrigation water to the sugarcane plantations in and around the Rutenga Business Center.Mwenezi (District) Map Although the police station is located along the highway, the main administrative offices are located at the Neshuro Business Center. The weather is hot and dry throughout the year, except during the summer when rain is frequent. In 2002, the population of the drought-prone district was estimated to be 126,000, up by 25,000 from 1992, the year of the drought.Administrative Units of Zimbabwe Mwenezi lies in natural regions four and five. The district is prone to droughts and experiences low mean annual rainfall. The majority of households in Mwenezi depend on agricultural production, like livestock rearing. The small amounts of rainfall have created a desire amongst households in Mwenezi to shift more towards livestock farming, especially cattle and goats, although the majority of households indicate that they have not been able to restock since the drought of 1992.  Education  As in other rural parts of the country, the schools in Mwenezi are government run, although some have historical links with missionary Christian denominations. There is one boarding school, Lundi Secondary School (run by the Free Methodist Church). The fact that all the secondary schools (other than Lundi) were established after independence, is testimony to the marginalization of the district and the \\"catching up\\" it needs to do. Though Zimbabwe has one of the highest literacy rates in the world, in some Mwenezi communities, such as Maranda, a former designated native reserve before independence in 1980, the rate is as low as 50 percent. = Secondary and primary schools = Notable schools in Mwenezi include Lundi Secondary School, situated along the Masvingo- Beitbridge Road,Masuture secondary school situated along Masvingo-Beitbridge Road just 60 km away from Lundi Christian high school, Mabhare Secondary School, north of the Mwenezi River but close to Manyuchi Dam, Dengenya Primary School, between Mwenezi and the Mushawe River,Kuwirirana Secondary School, Guiding Star Secondary School. Masogwe Baptist Secondary that was established in 2004 by Pst Nhamo Chigohi on the Neshuro Rd, Maranda High, Hlezana Secondary, Mwenezi Government School, Budirirai Secondary School, Rufaro Secondary school, Masuture Secondary School, Makawire Primary School, Shazhaume Primary School, Pambe Primary School,Zvirikure Primary School, Sarahuro Primary School, Masongwe Primary School, Hebron High School, Neshuro Secondary School, Neshuro Primary SChool,Rutenga Primary School,Gegare Primary School,Matibi Primary School. However, not all villages have secondary schools. Some students, especially those from villages along the Mwenezi River, below the main wall of the Manyuchi Dam, have to walk long distances to school, about fifteen to twenty kilometers. This state of affairs discourages students from going to school, instead opting to cross the border and go to South Africa.  Economy  The district's main employers are sugarcane plantations in Rutenga, Triangle and Chiredzi all connected by a railway line from Bulawayo. The cattle ranchers, before the influx of commercial farms in 2000, used to employ many people. As in most rural districts in the country, many people are also employed in the civil service mainly as teachers and nurses. The people in the district had always trekked to the mines of South Africa. However, the number of migrant workers has increased in recent times due to the economic recession that Zimbabwe has been going through. Few young people remain in the villages across the district, preferring to take their chances in South Africa working one menial contract job after the next. The Beitbridge on the border with South Africa makes their trek easier. =Tourism= In the past, the district generated some revenue from tourism, with large numbers of tourists visiting the private game parks in the district and the nearby Manyuchi Dam. = Business centers = A scene at Rutenga, along the highway between Masvingo and Beitbridge, 2006 The district has many service and business centres of varying sizes and economic vibrancy. Among these, Neshuro, Sarahuru, Sengejira, Maranda and Chaoma are noteworthy. The withdrawal of government- funded grain collection and distribution facilities as part of neoliberal reforms in the 1990s and the recent (1998‚Äì2008) economic woes of the country led to the decline of these centers. However, some, like Neshuro, have continued to grow, with water and poor roads the major deterrents to investment.  Government and politics  Akin to other districts in Masvingo Province, the ZANU-PF party dominates politics. Ever since the country's independence, the constituency has been represented by a ZANU-PF party member in the parliament of Zimbabwe. Isaiah Shumba was the representative for Mwenezi, winning both the 2000 and 2005 elections on the ZANU-PF ticket. = General elections 2008 = The district now sends two members to Zimbabwe's new House of Assembly. Each of the wards in the district has an elected official who works in the rural district council. The district has been a stronghold of ZANU-PF since independence in 1980, a trend that didn't change in the 2008 elections.Independent Election Results site (accessed 04/01/2008)Sokwanele site The district was divided into two parts, namely Mwenezi West and Mwenezi East, for the general elections of 2008. Candidates from both the Movement for Democratic Change ‚Äì Tsvangirai party and ZANU-PF competed for the two constituency seats. The winners will represent the district in the House of Assembly in the parliament of Zimbabwe. Mwenezi, together with Chivi (District), will elect a member to the new Zimbabwe Senate.Constituency Boundaries (accessed 02/12/2008)  Political violence  Ever since 2000, there have been sporadic reports of violence in the district, mostly perpetrated by ZANU-PF supporters and war veterans on their perceived enemies. Isiah Shumba, the former MP for Mwenezi constituency, was arrested with twelve other ZANU-PF supporters for political violence and intimidation in the run-up to the harmonized elections of 2008. He took a violent path after he had lost in the ZANU-PF primary election.A ban on political rallies (accessed 02/18/2008) He had run for the Mwenezi East seat and had lost to Kudakwashe Bhasikiti (2,793 votes) and Cletos Muchara (214 votes). Shumba was a distant third, garnering only 48 votes.Nonimation Court sitting extended (accessed 02/18/2008)Mwenezi MP arrested (accessed 02/19/2008)  Mwenezi East  Eight wards comprise this part of the district, which includes the land north of the Mwenezi River: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 13, and 18. Bhasikiti Kudakwashe (Zanu-PF), Murambwi Ananias (MDC Tsvangirai), and Chidyamakono Tavengwa (Independent) ran for the Mewnezi East House of Assembly seat with Bhasikiti winning with 9696 to Murambwi's 2477.  Mwenezi West  Election percentages. There are nine wards in the district: 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Mwenezi West comprises the area that is south of the Mwenezi River, including Manyuchi Dam. Masukume Pilot (Zanu- PF) and Tedious Douglas (MDC Tsvangirai) battled for the Mwenezi West constituency.List of 2008 candidates (accessed 02/18/2008) Pilot won the contest with a landslide of 12,636 to Tedeous's 1,577.  Infrastructure development  = Road network = The district is serviced by a network of mostly gravel roads. Apart from the shoulder-less A1 highway, all other roads in the district are of macadamized gravel roads. During the rainy season, despite the best efforts of DDF, they get washed away. Most places are accessible only by four-wheel-drive vehicles. Some of the vital bridges destroyed during Cyclone Eline in 2000 have yet to be repaired.AAA 2007 Road Report (accessed 02/28/2008) The primary mode of transport is by donkey cart, and phone lines connect most of the business centers with the outside world. A donkey cart along the gravel roads that service the district. Most people in Mwenezi rely on donkey carts for transport.  Health care  Public health care is delivered at four levels meant to function as a referral chain. The entry level includes rural health centers, rural hospitals, and urban clinics (whose services do not require an attending physician). District hospitals exist at the first referral level, provincial and general hospitals at the second referral level. The third referral level includes central and special hospitals. Most health care facilities in the district are owned and run by the government's Ministry of Health & Child Welfare, although local communities are involved in the management of some clinics. The main referral hospital is Mwenezi District Hospital at Neshuro. Previously the Neshuro clinic, it was upgraded by the Chinese to a rural hospital in the late 1980s. The Catholic-run Matibi Mission hospital to the northwest (bordering the Mberengwa District) also acts as another referral hospital. Several poly- clinics are scattered across the district offering primary health care. In recent years, as the economy of Zimbabwe has declined, shortage of drugs and equipment at hospitals emerged, although staffing levels by the end of 2010 had improved. Communities also rely heavily on traditional medicine. The major diseases that affect the people in the district include TB and malaria. Owing to the low rates of literacy, especially in Mwenezi West, TB remains a threat to the district as the affected usually don't finish their treatment regimes. = HIV/AIDS = The remoteness of the district from other areas has spared it from the scourge of HIV/AIDS. However, cases of the malady have been reported to be on the increase in recent years as the highly mobile youth that venture to South Africa in search of jobs gets exposed to the virus and bring it back.  General  The area south of the Mwenezi River, beyond the Maranda communal lands, is dominated by some of the country's largest ranches. Nuanesti Ranch, reputed to be the largest freestanding ranch in the province, if not the whole country, is found in the district along the A1 highway between Masvingo and Beitbridge.Nuanetsi Ranch (accessed 02/28/2008)Politicians Clash (accessed 02/28/2008)Satellite picture (accessed 2008-02-28) These ranches provide basic infrastructure, from schools and clinics to roads and dip-tanks. Since the farm invasions of early 2000, peasant farmers from the communal lands of both Matibi, north of the Mwenezi River, and those from the Maranda communal lands south of the river, invaded some of the arid ranches found in the district, changing the land use map.  Famous People  Paul Matavire, the singer who sang in the Paul Matavire and the Jairos Jiri Band, created many songs before his untimely death in 2005.

After arranging an affiliation between Ube Industries and Nippon Rayon in 1954, Sanwa began promoting industrial transactions between its major customers, formalizing the process in the early 1960s through the establishment of special promotion units. In 1968, Sanwa arranged the merger of the Nissho and Iwai trading companies to form Nissho Iwai (now Sojitz), creating a large general trading company to cater to its customers. The three largest members of the group (Hitachi Shipbuilding, Ube Industries and Teijin) had relatively independent positions with no cross- shareholdings.

Function  Protein kinase C (PKC) is a family of serine- and threonine-specific protein kinases that can be activated by the second messenger diacylglycerol. PKC family members phosphorylate a wide variety of protein targets and are known to be involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways. PKC family members also serve as major receptors for phorbol esters, a class of tumor promoters. Each member of the PKC family has a specific expression profile and is believed to play distinct roles in cells. The protein encoded by this gene is one of the PKC family members. Studies both in human and mice demonstrate that this kinase is involved in B cell signaling and in the regulation of growth, apoptosis, and differentiation of a variety of cell types. Protein kinase C delta is also regulated by phosphorylation on various serine/threonine (e.g. T50, T141, S304, T451, T505, S506, T507, S643, S664) and tyrosine residues including Y311 (by SRC).

She was capable of great speed and distance, and was a formidable warship with powerful guns. Ino was a clipper ship, purchased at Boston, Massachusetts, 30 August 1861 and commissioned at the Boston Navy Yard 23 September, Lt. J. P. Cressy in command. Unusual speed and large storage space suited her ideally for long-range cruising against Confederate commerce raiders. In search of \\"rebel pirates\\" Her first duty began 27 September when she departed Boston, Massachusetts, in search of \\"rebel pirates.\\" When word came that the South's famed cruiser CSS Sumter, under the brilliant master of seamanship, Captain Raphael Semmes, was in European waters, Ino sailed from Boston 5 February 1862 and reached Cadiz, Spain, only 13 days and 16 hours later. She assisted and to blockade Semmes at Gibraltar where he vainly sought repairs. Semmes finally abandoned Sumter there in order to get back into action. An interesting side light to this operation occurred at Tangier, Morocco 26 February when Ino took two crewmen of Sumter from a threatening mob and turned the prisoners over to the Boston-bound American merchant ship Harvest Home. Stateside operations Back in Boston, Ino was ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina, for duty in the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron 4 August 1862. On her voyage south she captured the French bark La Manche attempting to run the Charleston, South Carolina, blockade 23 August. Searching for Semmes again Six days later she arrived at St. George, Bermuda, to obtain from the American consul the latest information on blockade running activity in that quarter. She got underway the next day at the behest of the neutrality-conscious governor of Bermuda and made Port Royal 7 September. Only 4 days later she set sail for New York to be prepared for a cruise in search of her old adversary, Semmes, who was now attacking northern merchantmen with his new raider, . Ino departed New York 5 November and cruised in the lanes frequented by American merchantmen and whalers, arriving at St. Helena 5 January 1863. She remained in waters off St. Helena until setting course for the United States 1 March. She arrived New York 15 April for repairs. Ino departed New York 29 May 1863 escorting California-bound clipper Aquilla carrying the disassembled parts of monitor Comanche. After successfully shepherding her charge to safe waters well below the equator, she searched for and in waters ranging to the island of Fernando de Noronha, thence to New York, arriving 7 September 1863. Disguised as a merchantman in order to lure CSS Florida After repairs at New York, Ino joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Disguised as a merchantman to lure into action, she cruised in the North Atlantic Ocean 24 October when she arrived Portland, Maine. Ino was transferred to the East Gulf Blockading Squadron 22 November where she served until after the end of the war. She returned to New York 1 August 1865 and remained there under repairs until 16 October when she sailed to serve in the Mediterranean and off the coast of Portugal. Post-war decommissioning and sale Ino set-course for the United States 13 December 1866 and arrived Boston 25 January 1867. She decommissioned there 13 February and was sold at public auction 19 March 1867 to Samuel G. Reed.

Waterhouse married Elizabeth, n√©e Watson, on 26 March 1850. Church career He joined the Methodist society at 14 and in 1849 joined the ministry as a missionary to Fiji where he served until 1857. After two years in Australia he returned to Fiji in 1859 as chairman of the district and while touring the islands campaigned against cession to Britain. After a period of ill health, Waterhouse left Fiji in 1864 and worked in Tasmania and Victoria. Following the annexation of Fiji to Britain, Waterhouse returned to the islands and led the Training Institution until 1878 when he returned to Australia. Waterhouse was drowned when the Tararua was wrecked off the coast of Dunedin and was survived by his wife and ten children. Legacy Waterhouse was a supporter of local teachers in Fiji and is said to have converted fierce cannibal Seru Epenisa Cakobau, who as Vunivalu of Bau (Paramount Chief of Bau) became King of Fiji when he formed the first unified Fijian state in 1871.

Service began on October 1, 2007 making Valparaiso one of the smallest cities in the United States to have its own independent public transit system.V-Line Welcome Aboard!http://www.post-trib.com/news/opinion/588372,edit.article Operations The V-line was originally operated by McDonald Transit, a national transit operator primarily serving universities. Ride Right took over the operations in Fall 2010. In Valparaiso, the bus mostly serves the elderly and students of Valparaiso University. Commuters within the city also use it, but it is secondary to personal vehicles as a mode of transit. The system consists of 104 stops along 4 lines. The Green Line, Yellow Line, Red line, and Brown Line operate in the city of Valparaiso on weekdays and weekends. These three lines run as \\"flexible fixed\\" routes, meaning they have standard, scheduled stops which can be altered en route to meet the needs of those who cannot otherwise reach the bus. The fourth line, the Orange Line, operates express between Valparaiso University's student center and the Dune Park South Shore rail on Fridays-Sundays when Valparaiso University is in session and Fridays-Saturdays during the summer.V-Line Rider Information - Routes The line does not operate when NICTD conducts track and catenary repairs. On May 18, 2009, V-Line introduced a shuttle service that runs from Dune Park station to Valparaiso‚Äôs Village Station on weekdays during evenings as a way to supplement ChicaGo Dash bus service. However, that service was eliminated on February 1, 2010 due to low ridership. The system was started using a $615,000 federal grant. Until early 2008, the system used rented buses 16-24 person capacity minibuses. In Jan. 2008, new buses of similar capacity were delivered.MassTransitMag.com ¬ª Article ¬ª 'V-Line' Ready to Roll in Valparaiso A standard one-way fare costs $1.00 with one free transfer. Passengers are expressly forbidden from using the transfer on the same route. Senior citizens, students, children 5-18, and disabled persons can ride for half. Young children (under age 4) and Valparaiso University students ride for free.V-Line Rider Information - Fares History of service changes In August 2009, Valparaiso officials announced a series of changes that went into effect at the end of the month. First and foremost, V-Line gained a new Red Line route, which began service August 28, 2009. It is essentially an alternate version of the Orange Line route ‚Äì the buses that would previously sit idle during the scheduling breaks now travel around the city, overlapping with Green Line, Yellow Line and Brown Line buses.http://www.ci.valparaiso.in.us/v-line/timetables_redfriday.html During Sundays, it serves as an alternative to Yellow and Green Line routes, which don't operate on the first days of the week. The Red Line route is added on experimental basis for three months ‚Äì if it does well, it will be made permanent. Since then, the Red Line has become a permanent route for Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. It runs in a loop around the city before turning into the Orange Line route and running to the Dune Park NICTD trains station. In addition to introducing the Red Line, V-Line rearranged the schedules for the other routes. For Orange Line, the fall-spring Friday and Saturday service was truncated from 1:00 AM to 10:20 PM and 10:00 PM, respectively. As the result, Saturday and Sunday schedules became identical. By contrast, Yellow and Green Line route schedules were extended, running an hour later than before. Brown Line route was expanded, adding service to Ivy Tech and the Valparaiso Walk shopping complex.Summary of the most recent service updates In December 2013, the Brown Line route expanded its hours. It now begins at 12PM. After South Shore Line adjusted its weekend schedule on November 22, 2009, V-Line adjusted Orange Line and Red Line weekend schedules. Orange Line route's service hours shifted, running between 9:15 AM and 11:05 PM. The wait times at Dune Park station were shifted to allow the bus to connect to both eastbound and westbound trains (something that the previous version of the schedule rarely allowed). Red Line's service hours were shifted and extended - it now started at 8:15 AM rather than 7:45 AM and ended at 11:55 PM rather than 10:35 PM. The decrease in the number of weekend trains allowed Valparaiso officials to increase Red Line's service frequencies during morning and evening hours. On December 3, 2009, V-Line General Manager Ryan Landers stated that system ridership was down for all lines. He also explained that while Red Line ridership was climbing, it was still significantly below the numbers for other routes, remaining in double digits. Landers explained that he would like to keep the Red Line running for another six months - if the ridership doesn't pick up significantly, he will be forced to shut it down. Finally, he noted that while he would like to buy more vehicles in order to allow for shorter headways, the system can't afford them as of this writing. On May 15, 2010, the V-Line summer schedule was altered. Whereas before, Brown Line route was shut down while Orange Line route continued operating at reduced hours, this time around Orange, Brown and Red routes were completely shut down for the entire duration of the summer schedule.The announcement on V-Line's official website In the spring of 2010, the City of Valparaiso expressed its desire to consolidate operations of V-Line and ChicaGo Dash, bringing both systems under the same operator by fall 2010, when the current contracts expire.\\"Bus Lines May Consolidate\\" by James S. D. Wolf Jr It was hoped that consolidation would save money. Ultimately, though, the city decided to switch to a new contractor for V-Line and leave ChicaGo Dash as is.\\"Bus line costs expected to go down\\" by James D. Wolf Jr. The city is also considering revamping the current routes, but no clear plans have been announced at this time.2010 V-Line and ChicaGo Dash RFP Proposal Questions (Page 6) In May 2011, the city of Valparaiso considered altering the schedule the same way as the previous summer. However, the feedback from the riders convinced it to merely cut the Brown Line route for the summer and leave Orange Line and Red Line routes as is. In addition, the Green Line, Yellow Line and Red Line routes were temporarily altered to make up for the gaps in service that resulted from the suspension of the Brown Line route. In December 2013, the City of Valparaiso began a route study of the V-Line bus service. The study will finish in Spring 2014. The results of the study will aid in determining what changes are needed to the bus service to provide the best service possible with the resources at hand.

This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating other proteins and substrates, changing their activity. Protein kinase A catalytic subunit (PKA CŒ±) is a member of the AGC kinase family (protein kinases A, G, and C), and contributes to the control of cellular processes that include glucose metabolism, cell division, and contextual memory. PKA CŒ± is part of a larger protein complex that is responsible for controlling when and where proteins are phosphorylated. Defective regulation of PKA holoenzyme activity has been linked to the progression of cardiovascular disease, certain endocrine disorders and cancers.  Discovery  Edmond H. Fischer and Edwin G. Krebs at the University of Washington discovered PKA in the late 1950s while working through the mechanisms that govern glycogen phosphorylase. They realized that a key metabolic enzyme called phosphorylase kinase was activated by another kinase that was dependent on the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). They named this new enzyme the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, and proceeded to purify and characterize this new enzyme. Fischer and Krebs won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1992 for this discovery and their continued work on kinases, and their counterparts the protein phosphatases. Today, this cAMP- dependent protein kinase is more simply noted as PKA. Another key event in the history of PKA occurred when Susan Taylor and Janusz Sowadski at the University of California San Diego solved the three dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. It was also realized that inside cells, PKA catalytic subunits are found in complex with regulatory subunits and inhibitor proteins that block the activity of the enzyme. An additional facet of PKA action that was pioneered by John Scott at the University of Washington and Kjetil Tasken at the University of Oslo is that the enzyme is tethered within the cell through its association with a family of A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This led to the hypothesis that the subcellular localization of anchored PKA controls what proteins are regulated by the kinase.  Catalytic subunits  320px PRKACA is found on chromosome 19 in humans. There are two well-described transcripts of this gene, arising from alternative splicing events. The most common form, called CŒ±1, is expressed throughout human tissue. Another transcript, called CŒ±2, is found primarily in sperm cells and differs from CŒ±1 only in the first 15 amino acids. In addition, there are two other isoforms of the catalytic subunit of PKA called CŒ≤ and CŒ≥ arising from different genes but have similar functions as CŒ±. CŒ≤ is found abundantly in the brain and in lower levels in other tissues, while CŒ≥ is most likely expressed in the testis.  Signaling  Inactive PKA exists as a tetramer consisting of a regulatory (R) subunit dimer and two catalytic (C) subunits. This PKA holoenzyme complex is tethered to cell membranes and organelles through association with A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs). The addition of cAMP causes a conformational change in the anchored R subunits that releases the C subunits to phosphorylate downstream substrates. Inactive PKA holoenzyme exists as a tetramer composed of two regulatory (R) subunits and two catalytic (C) subunits. Biochemical studies demonstrated that there are two types of R subunits. The type I R subunits of which there are two isoforms (RIŒ±, and RIŒ≤) bind the catalytic subunits to create the type I PKA holoenzyme. Likewise type II R subunits, of which there are two isoforms (RIIŒ±, and RIIŒ≤), create the type II PKA holoenzyme. In the presence of cAMP, each R subunit binds 2 cAMP molecules and causes a conformational change in the R subunits that releases the C subunits to phosphorylate downstream substrates. The different R subunits differ in their sensitivity to cAMP, expression levels and subcellular locations. A-kinase-anchoring proteins (AKAPs) bind a surface formed between both R subunits and target the kinase to different locations in the cell. This optimizes where and when cellular communication occurs within the cell.  Clinical significance  Protein kinase A has been implicated in a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, tumors of the adrenal cortex, and cancer. It has been speculated that abnormally high levels of PKA phosphorylation contributes to heart disease. This affects excitation-contraction coupling, which is a rhythmic process that controls the contraction of cardiac muscle through the synchronized actions of calcium and cAMP responsive enzymes. There is also evidence to support that the mis-localization of PKA signaling contributes to cardiac arrhythmias, specifically Long QT syndrome. This results in irregular heartbeats that can cause sudden death. Mutations in the PRKACA gene that promote abnormal enzyme activity have been linked to disease of the adrenal gland. Several mutations in PRKACA have been found in patients with Cushing‚Äôs syndrome that result in an increase in the ability of PKA to broadly phosphorylate other proteins. One mutation in the PRKACA gene that causes an amino acid substitution of leucine to arginine in position 206, was found in over 60% of patients with adrenocortical tumors. Other mutations and genetic alterations in the PRKACA gene have been identified in adrenocortical adenomas that also disrupt PKA signaling, leading to aberrant PKA phosphorylation. The CŒ± gene has also been incriminated in a variety of cancers, including colon, renal, rectal, prostate, lung, breast, adrenal carcinomas and lymphomas. There is recent and growing interest in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. The molecular basis for this rare form of liver cancer that afflicts young adults is a genetic deletion on chromosome 19. The loss of DNA has been found in a very high percent of patients. The consequence of this deletion is the abnormal fusion of two genes- DNAJB1, which is the gene that codes for the heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40), and PRKACA. Further analyses of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma tissues show an increase in protein levels of this DNAJ-PKAc fusion protein. This is consistent with the hypothesis that increased kinase in liver tissues can initiate or perpetuate this rare form of liver cancer. Given the wealth of information on the three dimensional structures of DNAJ and PKA CŒ± there is some hope that new drugs can be developed to target this atypical and potentially tumorigenic fusion kinase.

They were built with multigauge trucks and to a reduced loading gauge for service anywhere in the world in the event of war.  History  = Development = The Korean War and the intensification of the Cold War at the beginning of the 1950s caused the Army Transportation Corps to consider what it might need for a new land war in Europe. They came up with a requirement for a locomotive capable of running on the existing tracks of a wide variety of railway systems. Key parts of the specification included adjustable-gauge trucks, compact bodywork to fit restrictive loading gauges, and replaceable couplers to fit a variety of systems. The trucks accepted wheelsets between standard gauge and , which encompasses the vast majority of the broad gauges in use worldwide, including those of the then Soviet Union () and the Iberian peninsula (). The specification was put out to tender, and two companies responded; GM and GE. Both companies were contracted produced a batch of thirteen locomotives which would be evaluated by the Army; the vendor providing the better locomotive would then produce the rest of the required locomotives. Both manufacturers delivered their sample batch in 1952, and after testing the GE locomotives, which were actually produced by ALCO as a subcontractor, were declared the winner, and a further batch of 70 ALCO MRS-1 locomotives were ordered. As delivered, they were painted in gloss black with white numbering and lettering. Fifty had steam generators for use in passenger service. The locomotives were numbered by the Army from 2041-2123. = Military service = The initial fate of most of the MRS-1 locomotives was to be placed in storage at the Army's Transportation Materiel Command facility at Marietta, Pennsylvania awaiting a war to use them in; they had not been purchased for peacetime use. These brand-new locomotives, with at most a couple of weeks' actual use, sat preserved until approximately 1970, when the Pentagon concluded that their plans for a future, large-scale land war no longer included the capture and use of the enemy's railway system. Thus the 96 locomotives were redundant for their original purpose. Many of the units were taken out of storage and assigned to various military installations around the country, where locomotives of that size and power were required. The Army eventually decided to transfer the units to the United States Navy. Five units stationed in Concord, California were the last to be used by the armed forces. =Post-military careers= Thirteen of the locomotives were sold to the Alaska Railroad‚Äîsix in 1974, and seven in 1975. Alaska retired its last ALCO MRS-1s in 1984. Two locomotives were sold to the Uruguayan Administraci√≥n de Ferrocarriles del Estado, numbered 1611, 1612. One suffered a fire in 1994 and was scrapped while the other is stored inoperable. While many locomotives were ultimately scrapped, several still exist, in various states of preservation. Examples exist at the Bluegrass Railroad and Museum, the Western Railway Museum, the Museum of Transportation, the Northern Pacific Railway Museum, the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum, the Western Pacific Railroad Museum (one MRS-1 from the Western Pacific Railroad Museum was transferred to Yreka Western Railroad where it operated as YWRR #244, and later was scrapped in 2011), the California State Railroad Museum, and Railtown 1897. In addition, the Eastern Shore Railroad (now Bay Coast Railroad) had stored two for possible future use, but they are now reported as scrapped in 2011. Cass Scenic Railroad also stored 2 examples, which were sold as surplus and later scrapped in 2010. ALCO MRS-1 #244 (Yreka Western Railroad)  Spotting features  EMD MRS-1, showing shutterless grilles and a peaked long hood. Being produced to the same specification, both GE/ALCO and EMD MRS-1s are very similar in appearance and can easily be mistaken; they are both C-C road- switchers that are very low in profile in order to fit within European loading gauges. The major exterior differences are the peaked cab roof and long hood roof on the EMD locomotives, and the radiator intakes on the sides of the long hood end, which have outside shutters on the ALCO locomotives. In addition, the short hood is visibly lower than the long hood, thanks to the long hood's peaked roof; on the ALCO units, the two are the same height. The frame side sills are also different; the ALCO's are straight from front to rear, while the EMD's step down towards each end of the locomotive.

He wrote poems in praise of these three kings. The poet's memorial is believed to be still in a place known as Darasuram in Kumbakonam, just opposite the famous Airavatesvara Temple. According to legend, the goddess Saraswati blessed him in Koothanur, then he became a famous poet.  Family  According to a legend, there was once a Chola king called Muchukundan who had his capital at Karur. He is said to have won the favor of God Murugan after deep penances and the latter is said to have bestowed upon him his personal bodyguards to aid him in his wars. Muchukundan Chola then married Chitravalli, daughter of the warrior chief and Murugan's bodyguard called Virabahu and spawned a new line. The poet Ottakoothar is presented as the scion of the family of this Sengunthar chief in his work Eeti-elupattu. It is worth mentioning that this Muchukunda Chola figures in the ancestry of Rajendra Chola I as detailed in his Tiruvalangadu copper plates.  Literary works  The poet is renowned for his Ula poems on the three successive kings, Vikrama Chola, Kulothunga Chola II and Rajaraja Chola II. The Ula poems are generally written in honor of the king and describe the triumphant procession of the king amidst the people and his subjects. He also authored a work dealing with the Kulottunga II's childhood called Kulottunga Cholan Pillai Tamil. During this period when he was very popular, the Sengunthar community, the one to which he belonged, requested him to compose a work in their honor. He initially refused but then later agreed provided they brought him 1008 heads of their first born sons. Accordingly, 1008 members of the community sacrificed their lives so that he could write about their history. The poet then wrote, Eetiyelupattu, a poem consisting of seventy verses in honor of the spear and extolled the glorious past of the Sengunthar chiefs and soldiers. He later wrote another poem called Eluppelupattu in order to bring back the 1008 dead members to life. When he sang it the heads are said to have miraculously attached to their bodies and the dead became alive once again. The poet Koothan thus came to be known as OttaKoothan for he attached the heads to the bodies. Popular culture In the 1957 Tamil film Ambikapathy, the character of Ottakoothar was portrayed and was performed by M. N. Nambiar. The character was also played by Rajesh in Mahasakthi Mariamman, a 1986 Tamil film.

He is primarily remembered for his various descriptions of elements and minerals, most particularly his descriptions of a method of producing silver, and of a substance he had created, which he called a 'fiery poison', and which, judging by his account, was arsenic trioxide, a highly toxic amphoteric oxide. He described the 'fiery poison' as being formed when a certain mineral (most probably realgar or orpiment) was fused with natron (naturally occurring sodium carbonate), and that dissolved in water to give a clear solution. He also wrote of how, when he placed a fragment of copper into the solution, the copper turned a deep green hue, lending further validity to the suggestion that orpiment or realgar was used, as they are both arsenic ores, and this would be the hue achieved from the copper after it had been placed in the arsenic trioxide had the substance formed been copper arsenite.John Emsley, The Elements of Murder: A History of Poison. Oxford University Press, 2006. . Agathodaemon's discoveries exist as part of the foundations for later use of poison, as arsenic and related substances were used regularly in later centuries as means of poisoning and murder. Since the only records of his existence are references in later works, he may be apocryphal, but since the practice of alchemy itself began to decline around the time he is believed to have lived, and it may be that much of his writing was lost. This information that was gathered by the Nestorians eventually passed on to the Arabs, and this in part contributed to the flourishing of alchemy in that region and in their hands; the modern English word \\"alchemy\\" comes from the Arabic language, and many of the foundations for alchemy in Western nations were laid by the Arabs.Joseph Jastrow, Story of Human Error. Ayer Publishing, 1936.

This is an upmarket locality close to Jubilee Hills. This area was a hilly forest and was least inhabited in the past. Only few royal members of the Nizam's dynasty lived here, which was a hunting ground for them. Even with its history and status, this area now has completely been transformed to an urban commercial centre consisting of an array of high-end hotels, restaurants, night clubs and office buildings of global corporations. Banjara Hills is segregated by its road numbers, with each road having its own importance: the numbers start from 1 and end at 14. Banjara Hills is considered the most expensive zip code in India according to Economic Times magazine and, along with Jubilee Hills, is the most prestigious borough/city in the greater Hyderabad area to live in. Economic Times estimated that properties in Banjara Hills were worth \\"a whopping Rs 96,000 crore\\", an equivalent to US$20.7 billion, as of 8 September 2011). The much neglected Banjara Lake is also located here.  History  Alhambra, residence of architect Muhammad Fayyazuddin was located on Road number 10 at Banjara Hills. It was demolished in 1986‚Äì87 The land was first bought by Nawab Mehdi Nawaz Jung, a minister in the court of the last Nizam in 1927, who built his residence, Banjara Bhavan (supposedly inspired by Antoni Gaud√≠'s works) here. The last Nizam suggested that the area be named after the Nawab, as the man responsible for its development. However, the Nawab stated that it would only be fair to name the area after its original inhabitants, the Banjaras. The Banjara Bhavan was visited by Jawaharlal Nehru as well as Rabindranath Tagore, who wrote a poem inspired by the area. Road No. 1 of Banjara Hills is now known as Mehdi Nawaz Jung Road, named in his honour. Landscape Banjara Hills is famous for its hotels, upscale restaurants and large shopping malls. Taj Krishna, Taj Deccan and Taj Banjara are well-known star hotels in this area. Many restaurants offer cuisines from all over the world: Chinese Pavilion, Ohris Banjara, Barbeque Nation, and Fusion 9. There are many retail business establishments. Big malls like the GVK One, City Center, Midtown, Ohri's, Alcazar Plaza, Zing Designs, among many more dot the skyline. The highest building in the Banjara Hills area is the commercial Laxmi Cyber Center. The Jalagam Vengal Rao Park is in Banjara Hills. This park is very beautiful, has its own charm, and many locals visit regularly for jogging and relaxing. Most of the businesses are concentrated on Road No. 1 and 3. Muffakham Jah College of Engineering and Technology is on Road No. 3. This college has one of the largest campuses in the city. It works under the management and ownership of Sultan-ul-Uloom Education Society, which also operates Sultan-ul-Uloom College of Law, College of Education, Junior College, and School in the same premises. KBR park, named after Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, is close to Road No. 3. A cultural centre, called Lamakaan, opened on Road No. 1 in 2010.

Sociological criticism analyzes both how the social functions in literature and how literature works in society. This form of literary criticism was introduced by Kenneth Burke, a 20th-century literary and critical theorist, whose article \\"Literature As Equipment for Living\\" outlines the specification and significance of such a critique. Sociological criticism is influenced by New Criticism; however, it adds a sociological element as found with critical theory (Frankfurt School), and considers art as a manifestation of society, one that contains metaphors and references directly applicable to the existing society at the time of its creation. According to Kenneth Burke, works of art, including literature, \\"are strategic namings of situations\\" (Adams, 942) that allow the reader to better understand, and \\"gain a sort of control\\" (Adams, 942) over societal happenings through the work of art. This complicates the basic trend of New Criticism which simply calls for a close textual reading without considering affective response or the author's intentions. While Burke also avoids affective response and authorial intention, he specifically considers pieces of art and literature as systematic reflections of society and societal behavior. He understands the way in which these artworks achieve this to be strategically employed through the work, and he therefore suggests the standardization of the methods used by the artists and authors so as to be able to consider works of art within a social context.  Sociology and literature  =Importance= Austin Harrington outlines in his book Art and Social Theory six ways in which art can be approached from a sociological standpoint: 1) humanistic historic approach, 2) Marxist social theory, 3) cultural studies, 4) theory of art in analytical philosophy, 5) anthropological studies of art, and 6) empirical studies of contemporary art institutions (Harrington, 15). The variety of sociological approaches introduced by Harrington confronts traditional, metaphysical approaches to art. According to Harrington, \\"sociological approaches generally possess a stronger sense of the material preconditions, historical flux and cultural diversity of discourse, practices and institutions of art,\\" (Harrington, 31). Harrington argues that pieces of art can serve as \\"normative sources of social understanding in their own right\\" (Harrington, 207); the ways in which these sources make manifest this social understanding is precisely what is of interest to Kenneth Burke. As Harrington observes, there are several methods of regarding art from a sociological perspective, and considering the sociological element is essential because art is inevitably full of references and commentaries on the present day society. Sociological critics are then to look at exactly how such references and commentaries function within the work of art, so that codification of their method is possible. =Employment= In Franco Moretti's article \\"The Dialectic of Fear\\", he addresses the methods by which Mary Shelley and Bram Stoker highlight the problems and inconsistencies within their societies through their respective novels Frankenstein, and Dracula. Moretti notes that the fear in Frankenstein lies in the protagonist and not the reader, so as to encourage the reader to \\"reflect on a number of important problems (the development of science, the ethic of family, respect for tradition) and agree ‚Äì rationally ‚Äì that these are threatened by powerful and hidden forces,\\" (Moretti, 12). Shelley does this, notes Moretti, by keeping the novel in the past tense, and not hiding any of the monster's qualities, but rather informing the readers totally, (Moretti, 12). Stoker, by contrast, wants to scare his readers, and so Moretti recognizes the way in which this is done: \\"the narrative time is always in the present, and the narrative order ‚Äì always para tactic ‚Äì never establishes causal connections ... the reader has only clues\\" (Moretti, 12). Kenneth Burke would approach these pieces of literature through their statements on society, and push for sociological critics to standardize methods like the ones employed by Shelley and Stoker as a way of regarding art as a function of, and functioning in, society ‚Äì a criticism technique that \\"cut[s] across previously established disciplines\\" (Adams, 942). =Types = There are many sub classifications of sociological criticism, two of the most prominent being Marxist criticism and feminist criticism.

Dismissed in 1886 from his clerical employment with the Victorian public service for \\"insubordination\\", he had already had occasional pieces published, including in the Melbourne Herald where he won the poetry prize in 1885 for a poem about the Eight Hour Day.http://www.takver.com/history/andrews.htm#writings link accessed 31 March 2008 \\"J.A.

But he would also live in the extreme of poverty. It is unclear when he joined the Melbourne Anarchist Club but was appearing at its meetings by early 1887, and rapidly became a significant member. In the Melbourne Anarchist Club he represented the communist anarchism pole, strongly influenced by Kropotkin, and edited the club's journal Honesty. He took an active part in the struggles of the day, notably the 1890 Australian maritime dispute and was involved with the Sydney direct action group, the Active Service Brigade. He was imprisoned for three months in NSW in 1894 for the publication of A Handbook of Anarchy (the actual charge being a technicality), and further imprisoned for five months (plus two months on remand) for sedition in 1895.http://www.takver.com/history/andrews.htm#writings link accessed 31 March 2008 \\"J.A.

(O'Dowd may have been slightly exaggerating but apart from his European correspondence Andrews is known to have studied Chinese and he would have learned Latin at Scotch College.) A polymath, personally eccentric, ascetic in habits, a defender of the despised Chinese, he was nevertheless respected in the labour movement. Bernard O'Dowd supported his appointment as editor of the labour journal Tocsin in 1902, a position he held for a few months before his health collapsed and he was hospitalized and shortly died of tuberculosis.

Accessed November 20, 2007. Political career Vallenilla Lanz held a number of positions under the dictatorship of Juan Vicente G√≥mez and was well known as an apologist for his regime. In his best-known work, Cesarismo Democr√°tico (1919; English title: Democratic Caesarism), he justified the caudillo system by stating that due to the character of the Venezuelan people, rule by a dictator was necessary to maintain public order. In his view, this system was democratic in the sense that it was due to the \\"unconscious suggestion of the majority\\".pp. 15-17, R√≥mulo Betancourt and the Transformation of Venezuela, Robert Jackson Alexander, Transaction Publishers, 1982, .Leo B.

He was for a time the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Venezuela to France during the 1930s. Ideology Vallenilla was \\"largely responsible for developing a body of historical and sociological theory dealing with issues of race, power relations, and social development\\". He viewed \\"the popular masses as a backward and unruly social group\\" and argued that political leadership needed to be \\"exercised through the mediation of a popular strongman who would channel the energies of the masses during the transition to a democratic order\\". =Democratic Caesarism= Specifically, Vallenilla argued that race had no biological basis and ought to be understood as socially constructed, particularly through political projects of nation-making. Vallenilla assailed the notion that racial purity provides moral or political legitimacy. Death Vallenilla's funeral was held on November 18, 1936 at the √âglise Saint-Pierre-de-Chaillot in Paris.

The party supports consumer protection and trade union rights. History UD was founded on 11 September 2007 by two dissenting members of Democracy is Freedom ‚Äì The Daisy (DL) who were opposed to the foundation of the Democratic Party (PD). Willer Bordon (leader of the new party) and Roberto Manzione, and two leading consumer rights leaders, Elio Lanutti and Bruno De Vita, leader of United Consumers, were integrated in the new party. Bordon and Manzione were both members of the most Ulivista faction in DL, that one led by Arturo Parisi and decided to leave DL because in their opinion, PD was born as a bureaucratic union of apparatuses between DL and the Democrats of the Left and they were the \\"true Democrats\\". Bordon had been a strong supporter of the idea of a \\"Democratic Party\\" since 1992, when he left the Democratic Party of the Left to form Democratic Alliance, forerunner of the first Democratic Union, The Democrats and Democracy is Freedom ‚Äì The Daisy, respectively. All four parties were committed in uniting the whole Italian centre-left into a single party and Bordon was a keen supporter of this. On 27 November 2007 UD formed a joint group in the Senate with Liberal Democrats of Lamberto Dini.ALICE Notizie The convergence between the two small parties, which retained their autonomy, is based on some key points (a plurality voting system, more powers for the prime minister, fiscal conservatism, tax cuts and social security reform) and was open to all the senators. Both Bordon and Manzione, as also Dini and D'Amico, have a long record of dissenting votes from the majority. The group was predicted as likely to have much influence in the Senate, where the centre-left had only a narrow majority of two votes and where Liberal Democrats were the fourth force of the coalition, after the Democratic Party, the Communist Refoundation Party and Democratic Left. For technical reasons, the two parties formed separate groups in the Senate in order to have more speaking time, whilst coordinating almost every position together and formed a joint group until the Liberal Democrats decided to withdraw support from Romano Prodi's government and to join The People of Freedom. In the 2008 general election, Democratic Union for Consumers failed to gain enough votes to enter Parliament. On 30 December 2017, the secretary Bruno de Vita died, and the party has effectively ceased its activities.

He also represented Guadeloupe and was a member of their squad. Quistin had a nomadic career after he arrived in England, turning out for a number of non-League sides at different levels of the football pyramid. Club career Quistin spent much of his short span of years in playing English football in the southern part of the country. He had spells with Brentford, Wimbledon, Falkirk, Gravesend & Northfleet and Windsor & Eton, before joining Carshalton Athletic in February 2003. He joined Billericay Town in August 2004, but was released the following month. He joined King's Lynn in January 2005. He played out the 2004‚Äì05 season with King's Lynn, although he also had a trial with League Two side Wycombe Wanderers in April 2005. In September 2005 he joined Conference South side Havant & Waterlooville. After only three substitute appearances, he was loaned out to Isthmian League side Tooting & Mitcham, before returning to Havant towards the end of the season. He was sacked by Havant in August 2006 for misconduct, and had an unsuccessful trial with Cambridge City later than month, before joining Harlow Town for a spell. Conference South side Dorchester Town was next on Quistin's map, but in a typically short spell he made just three substitute appearances for the Magpies before he left to take trials at a number of league clubs, turning out for Luton Town, Leyton Orient and Brentford. He joined doomed Conference National side Tamworth in March 2007, and was involved in the majority of the Lambs' final games of the season before being sent off in the 1‚Äì1 draw at home to St Albans City that saw the side relegated to the Conference North.

Following his departure from Hednesford, he joined Weston-super-Mare later in September 2008. He was released by Weston in December 2008, and joined Fisher Athletic later the same month. Quistin signed for Grays Athletic on non-contract terms in February 2009, but following two appearances, he left the club in March, re-joining Hednesford Town.

In 2012, the start-date for construction of the wind farm has been pushed back to 2014, after AGL Energy decided to give priority to building two solar photovoltaic plants which have received almost A$200m in government funding.

On 3 June 2016 that application was granted, giving AGL the option to optimise and build the project within their Powering Australian Renewables Fund.

He is a member of the U.S. National Soccer Hall of Fame. Professional career Dick began his professional career with Armadale F.C. in the Scottish Football League. In 1923, at the age of seventeen, he moved to the United States, settling in Niagara Falls, New York. When he arrived, he immediately began playing with the Niagara Falls Rangers. The manager of Providence F.C. of the American Soccer League spotted Dick playing for Rangers and offered him a contract. Dick went on to play six seasons with Providence between 1924 and 1930. However, in 1928, the team changed its name to the Providence Gold Bugs. By 1930, the ravages of the Great Depression and the \\"Soccer Wars\\" had begun to take their toll on the ASL and teams began to fold, move and merge. In 1930, a group of businessmen led by Harold Brittan bought the team, and moved the team to Fall River, Massachusetts where it spent most of the 1930-1931 ASL season as Fall River F.C.. When Fall River merged with the New Bedford Whalers during the spring of 1931, Dick moved to the Pawtucket Rangers. The Rangers left the ASL in the fall of 1932 as the league began to collapse, but joined the newly formed second American Soccer League in the fall of 1933. In 1934 and 1935, the Rangers went to the National Challenge Cup, only to fall to Stix, Baer and Fuller F.C. in 1934 and the same team, only renamed St. Louis Central Breweries F.C. in 1935. In 1937, he joined the Kearny Scots-Americans and remained with the team through the 1941 season. During that span, Kearny won five league championships.

Wang was the only person to have been discharged from such an institution to a Western country. In 2005, he was released and now lives in exile in Germany. Biography Wang's parents were a labourer and an office worker. Wang grew up during the Cultural Revolution, and attended a middle school in Beijing. His activism was influenced by the death of his grandmother, who starved to death in a rural famine.In the grip of the Ankang, The Guardian, 20 December 2005 In 1968, the communist authorities sent him to a collective farm in Heilongjiang, a province next to the Russian border. =Activism= Whilst in the collective farm, he wrote a personal letter to Mao urging him to reinstate the then disgraced Deng Xiaoping. He was arrested in the middle of the night and spent the next month in jail. In 1976, with mass popular demonstrations taking place in Tiananmen Square following the death of Zhou Enlai, Wang wrote to premier Hua Guofeng again in an attempt to seek the rehabilitation of Deng. He was branded a \\"reactionary\\" and jailed for 17 months. In February 1979, after Deng had returned to power, Wang was allowed to go back to Beijing, where he took a job in a vegetable warehouse. Wang participated in the 1979 Democracy Wall Movement. He was involved in the student-led democracy movement of 1989, when he attempted to advise the students on strategy, and to mediate between them and the government. In December 1998, wrote an open letter to China's leaders, pleading for leniency against Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai and Qin Yongmin, jailed for establishing the China Democracy Party.Indefinite incarceration in a psychiatric institution, Human Rights in China, 22 May 2002 Wang was again arrested on 4 June 1992 when he, acting alone, unfurled a banner in Tiananmen Square on the third anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He was swiftly arrested and locked up in a psychiatric hospital near Beijing, with a concocted diagnosis of \\"political monomania\\". The official record said: \\"He was diagnosed as suffering from 'paranoia', and his dangerous behaviour was attributed to his state of delusion.\\" He spent almost 13 years in an Ankang centre in nearby Fangshan. Inside Ankang Wang described widespread abuses in the Beijing Ankang, which is under the control of the Public Security Bureau (PSB): Wang said he had to live in cells with psychotically disturbed inmates convicted of murder, and was forced to swallow chlorpromazine, a psychoactive drug three times a day. He reported under-staffing and described a regime of mismanagement and anarchy: there were only two nurses looking after seventy psychotic patients. Inmates died from abuses from staff and inmates‚Äîthere was use of electric shock as treatment, and witnessed two deaths which resulted: one from a heart attack during electric acupuncture treatment and one person, Huang Youliang, -incarcerated for \\"persistently submitting petitions\\" ‚Äì had been on hunger strike, and died while being force-fed by inmates.Richard Spencer, Tiananmen protester's 13 years of torment in psychiatric prison, The Telegraph, 5 November 2005, retrieved 9 October 2007 In August 1999, he was discharged under pressure from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International for a three-month trial period, subject to him having no contact with the media.

The Dinosaur Films of Ray Harryhausen. McFarland & Company, 2004. p. 87-88. The dinosaurs that appear include an Allosaurus, a Stegosaurus, a pair of Ceratosaurus, a Triceratops, a Tyrannosaurus, and a female Brontosaurus, along with one of her hatchlings. O‚ÄôBrien built the dinosaur models and miniature landscapes while the actual animation was performed by Harryhausen. Harryhausen used two cameras for the stop-motion dinosaur sequences, and in interviews after his retirement he stated he ran into a dispute with the Hays Office because it felt the dinosaur fights were too gruesome, even though, as Harryhausen pointed out, the film's live action sequences show fights between lions and gazelles and the like. For many years, still shots from the segment were included in View-Master slide show reels.Scott Shaw. \\"The Animal World\\". Comic Book Resource. Retrieved 2007-10-08.

She has since been converted to a training ship for the Naval & Maritime Academy, Trincomalee. She was originally HMCS Hallowell of the Royal Canadian Navy, built during the Second World War and then saw service as INS Miznak of the Israeli Navy. The Royal Ceylon Navy purchased her in 1958 from Israel. Construction and career =Royal Canadian Navy and Israeli Navy= HMCS Hallowell was ordered on 1 February 1943 as part of the 1943-44 River-class building program by the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN). She was laid down by Canadian Vickers Ltd. aT Montreal on 22 November 1943 and launched 28 March 1944. She was commissioned into the RCN on 8 August 1944 at Montreal. After working up at Bermuda, Hallowell was assigned to the Mid-Ocean Escort Force (MOEF) escort group C-1 as the Senior Officer's Ship. From late November 1944 until June 1945, she was continuously employed as a convoy escort on North Atlantic convoys. In June 1945 she returned to Canada and from July to August transported troops from St. John's to Canada. She was paid off at Sydney, Nova Scotia on 7 November 1945 and placed in reserve at Shelburne, Nova Scotia. After the war she was sold to Uruguayan interests in 1946 before being re-sold to a Palestinian group in 1949 for conversion to a short-service ferry in the Mediterranean Sea. She was renamed Sharon and remained in service until 1952, when she was purchased by the Israeli Navy, rearmed and commissioned as INS Miznak and given the designation K-32. She remained in service until 1958. =Royal Ceylon Navy= Purchased from the Israeli Navy in 1958‚Äì3 years after another River-class frigate, HMCyS Mahasena--she was commissioned as HMCyS Gajabahu into the Royal Ceylon Navy. She participated in many flag-showing missions in various countries, including a cruise to Japan. Gajabahu also took part in many international naval exercises. Following the failed military coups d'√©tat in 1962 in which the former Captain of the Navy (as the Commander of the Navy was known then) was implicated, the government undertook a program of downsizing the military. As a result, Gajabahu became the flagship of the fleet and only major warship of the Royal Ceylon Navy after Mahasena and Parakram were sold off and Vijaya was lost in a storm. During the 1971 Insurrection she could not be deployed to sea since her crew were dispatched for ground duty due to personnel shortages. \\"HMCyS Gajabahu\\" became \\"SLNS Gajabahu\\" when Sri Lanka became a republic in 1972. In the 1980s she was taken out of active service to be converted to a training ship for the Naval and Maritime Academy, Trincomalee.

He was also a voice actor. Biography Shin Kishida was born at Kawakita General Hospital in Asagaya, Suginami, Tokyo. His uncle was playwright Kunio Kishida, and actress Ky≈çko Kishida and children's author Eriko Kishida were his first cousins. He lived in Nakano until the age of five. In 1944 he enrolled in Yumoto Elementary School in Hakone, Kanagawa, where he was sent to live as part of a wartime evacuation of children from major cities. He returned to Tokyo in 1947, and transferred to Kudan Elementary School, Chiyoda, Tokyo. After graduating from Kojimachi Junior High School (Kojimachi Chugakko, where he became friends with future politician Koichi Kato) and Kaijo High School (Kaijo Koko), he took a year off from his studies before entering the English literature department of Hosei University. However, he dropped out in his second year after deciding to become an actor. =Debut= In 1961 Kishida joined a drama study group attached to the Bungakuza theater troupe. The following year he joined Bungakuza as an apprentice and became a full-fledged member in 1965, but left in early 1966 to form the theater group Rokugatsu Gekijo (June Theater) with his wife Chiho Yuki, Katsumi Matsumura and others, and subsequently concentrated on film and television work. Kishida may be best-remembered for playing Hammer-esque vampires in Toho's Bloodthirsty film series. Many Japanese fans regard Kishida and Christopher Lee as the quintessential screen vampires. Coincidentally, Kishida appeared alongside Shigeru Amachi, a pioneer of the Japanese vampire role in Nobuo Nakagawa's The Lady Vampire (Onna Kyuketsuki, 1959) on the 6th episode of the television period drama Mushuku Samurai in 1973. Kishida appeared in several works by Tsuburaya Productions including Return of Ultraman (Kaette kita Urutoraman) and Operation: Mystery! (Kaiki Daisakusen). He wrote screenplays under the name Shin Akekawa, such as episode 35 of Return of Ultraman, \\"Zankoku! Hikari Kaiju Purizuma\\". Kishida's design for the light- inspired Prisma monster is widely regarded as the most beautiful of the second wave of Ultra Series monsters, and features in many books on the subject. As Shin Kishida he also wrote a script for episode 12 of the Tokusatsu show Fireman. Kishida also worked frequently with director Kihachi Okamoto, and was a key figure in his latter works. His sidesplitting portrayal of a garish suit-wearing enemy yakuza captain in Dainamaito Dondon, and his turn as an eerie secretary to a political mastermind in Blue Christmas (the epitome of his stated desire to appear in brief supporting roles that change the tone of an entire film) are some of his most representative work. He also formed a celebrated partnership with Akio Jissoji, a former colleague from his days working for Tsuburaya. His 1977 film, Utamaro's World (Utamaro: Yume to Shiriseba), was probably frequent Kishida's only lead role in a major production (although he does not headline the film), and was screened at the Cannes Film Festival. From time to time, he deliberately shaved his head and wore a wig for his roles in the television series Kizudarake no Tenshi and Tantei Monogatari. In a guest appearance as \\"Phantom Thief #103\\" on the 13th episode of Tantei Monogatari, he engages in a fencing duel with star Y≈´saku Matsuda towards the end. A thrust by Matsuda's character connects with the Phantom Thief's hair, ripping off his wig and exposing his bald pate with the number 103 neatly written on it. =Personal life= In 1964 Kishida married actress Chiho Y≈´ki (who later changed her stage name to Kiki Kirin). They divorced in 1968. Kishida later remarried, but this second marriage also ended in divorce. =Influence= A regular in the works of directors Kihachi Okamoto, Akio Jissoji and Tatsumi Kumashiro, Kishida was revered by many actors including Kenichi Hagiwara, Yutaka Mizutani and Y≈´saku Matsuda. Fellow Bungakuza actor Daigo Kusano was his lifelong best friend. Shintaro Katsu also praised him highly for his talent and character, and appeared alongside him in several films. Kishida also worked as an instructor for Katsu's acting school \\"Katsu Academy\\". One of his students was Kazuki Kosakai. Actor Asao Kobayashi, who co-starred with Kishida in Taiyo Sentai Sun Vulcan, was so overcome by the shock of Kishida's sudden death that he took a hiatus from acting and left show business permanently a few years later. =Death= On 28 December 1982, Kishida died of esophageal cancer, aged 43. Shortly after news of Kishida's death, television reruns of his final tokusatsu series \\"Solar Squadron Sun Vulcan\\" began in the Tokyo area, and his first appearance in the opening episode of the series was accompanied by a memorial message.

Zavaleta was an extremely influential Bolivian thinker of the second half of the twentieth century. His thought is usually divided into three periods: the first nationalist, followed by an orthodox Marxist phase, and finally his more influential unorthodox Marxism from a uniquely Bolivian perspective. Concepts originating from his work are fundamental to later development in Bolivian social sciences. Notable concepts such as \\"sociedad abigarrada\\" (roughly translated \\"motley society\\"), meaning a society juxtaposed by asymmetric relations of differentiated cultural power and its respective modes of production. Additionally considered important are Zavaleta's meaning of the terms \\"mases\\" (\\"masses\\") and \\"multitude\\". Today his work is considered essential for understanding the reality of Bolivian cultural, political, and social life. As a politician, Ren√© Zavaleta was the Minister of Mines and Petroleum during the revolutionary government of the Revolutionary Nationalist Movement (MNR). He also acted as a diplomat for Bolivia to Uruguay and Chile.

It stated that livestock accounts for 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, a figure which FAO changed to 14.5% in its 2013 study Tackling climate change through livestock. Report Livestock's Long Shadow is an assessment of research, taking into account direct impacts of livestock production, along with the impacts of feed crop cultivation. The report states that the livestock sector is one of the top two or three most significant contributors to serious environmental problems. The findings of this report suggest that it should be a major policy focus when dealing with problems of land degradation, climate change and air pollution, water shortage and water pollution, and loss of biodiversity. Senior author Henning Steinfeld stated that livestock are \\"one of the most significant contributors to today‚Äôs most serious environmental problems\\" and that \\"urgent action is required to remedy the situation.\\" Following a life-cycle analysis approach, the report evaluates \\"that livestock are responsible for 18% of greenhouse gas emissions\\" Greenhouse gas emissions arise from feed production (e.g. chemical fertilizer production, deforestation for pasture and feed crops, cultivation of feed crops, feed transport and soil erosion), animal production (e.g. enteric fermentation and methane and nitrous oxide emissions from manure) and as a result of the transportation of animal products. Following this approach the report estimates that livestock \\"is responsible for 18 percent\\" of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, but 37% of methane and 65% of nitrous oxide emissions. The main sources of emissions were found to be: * Land use and land use change: 2.5 Gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent; including forest and other natural vegetation replaced by pasture and feed crop in the Neotropics (CO2) and carbon release from soils such as pasture and arable land dedicated to feed production (CO2) * Feed Production (except carbon released from soil): 0.4 Gigatonnes CO2 equivalent, including fossil fuel used in manufacturing chemical fertilizer for feed crops (CO2) and chemical fertilizer application on feed crops and leguminous feed crop (N2O, NH3) * Animal production: 1.9 Gigatonnes CO2 equivalent, including enteric fermentation from ruminants (CH4) and on-farm fossil fuel use (CO2) * Manure Management: 2.2 Gigatonnes CO2 equivalent, mainly through manure storage, application and deposition (CH4, N2O, NH3) * Processing and international transport: 0.03 Gigatonnes CO2 equivalent Controversy A 2009 article in the Worldwatch Institute magazine by authors Robert Goodland and Jeff Anhang, then employed at the World Bank, claimed that the FAO report was too conservative and that livestock sector accounts for much more of global GHG emissions, at least 51%, taking into account animal respiration and photosynthetic capacity of the land used for feeding and housing livestock. A 2011 response to this was published by FAO and an international coalition of scientists, discrediting the magazine article and upholding the 2006 assessment. But this response was fully answered back in Animal Feed Science and Technology (AFST) Journal, and they reiterated their estimate while FAO scientists declined to continue the debate despite AFST Editor‚Äôs invitation. In 2013 FAO publicly partnered with International Meat Secretariat and the International Dairy Federation and many of the same authors of the first report published a subsequent (2013) study for the FAO, revising their estimate of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions due to livestock downward to 14.5% without addressing any of the alleged errors pointed out in Goodland and Anhang‚Äôs report or in the ensuing peer-reviewed debate. The results of Livestock's Long Shadow had an error in methodology as the authors only compared tailpipe emissions of cars while meat production a comprehensive life-cycle assessment was used to calculate livestock‚Äôs green house gas effect. This underestimated transportation therefore inflating meat productions contribution. This issue was raised by Dr. Frank Mitloehner from the University of California, Davis. In an interview with BBC Pierre Gerber, one of the authors of Livestock's Long Shadow, accepted Dr. Mitloehner's criticism. \\"I must say honestly that he has a point - we factored in everything for meat emissions, and we didn't do the same thing with transport, we just used the figure from the IPCC...\\" he said. However, this information is still commonly misused in movements such as \\"Meatless Monday\\". Dr. Mitloehner is the author of a 2009 study on the topic of livestock and climate change. Five percent of the funds for said study were provided by the livestock industry, according to the press release of Mitloehner's university.

According to Fremont, he had to do most of the work for Preuss, but he still retained Preuss as a topographer on the expedition he was to embark on in the spring of 1842. \\"Fr√©mont's sensational report included an excellent topographical map by Charles Preuss, The large sheet, which depicted the routes of both of Fr√©mont's expeditions, was a cartographic milestone.

He declined to accompany Fremont on his third expedition and in 1846, Preuss completed the second map, more important for prospective emigrants than the first. On seven sheets he carefully traced the Oregon Trail, using Fr√©mont's narrative to indicate campsites with essential grass, wood, and water and to show distances, climate, and Indian inhabitants. Widely popular among those who took the Platte River road to Oregon and California, this annotated atlas was one of the greatest contributions Fr√©mont and Preuss made to the development of the West.\\"Vanguard of Expansion: Army Engineers in the Trans-Mississippi West, 1819‚Äì1879. Chapter II: FR√âMONT AND THE SCREAMING EAGLE Congress commissioned to Preuss create a third map in 1848, this time using information from records kept by Lt. Kern who was the topographer on Fremont's third expedition. Fourth Fremont Expedition and the Pacific Railroad Survey In 1848 Preuss agreed to accompany Fremont on his fourth expedition, which ended in disaster with the death of 10 men and two more that tried to rescue the group that were caught high in the Rockies during the winter. The remaining men managed to find their way to safety in Albuquerque New Mexico, where word of discovery of gold in California made its way, and in the spring of 1849, Fremont and Preuss proceeded to California, and Preuss worked for Fremont surveying Fremont's Mariposa Land Grant. His health failed him; the cause attributed to heat stroke, and he returned east where he assisted in the preparation of two maps of the 1849-50 Stansbury expedition. In 1853, Preuss was engaged by Lt.Robert S. Williamson as the draughtsman on the San Francisco to Southern California half of the Pacific Coast portion of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. The expedition sailed from New York City and landed in San Francisco in June, 1853. They surveyed south to the Mohave Desert, and finished in San Diego in December 1853. Preuss's again experienced health issues during the survey, but he managed to complete a map of the expedition. Commemorations Pruess Lake (sic), located south of Garrison in west- central Utah, is named after him.Van Cott, J. W., 1990, Utah Place Names, His diary of the Fremont expedition was featured on a 2008 episode of This American Life. It contrasted Fremont's exuberance with Preuss' sober, often humorously melancholy opinions of the expedition. The Army Geospatial Center has mounted a number of plaques commemorating famous topographic engineers. One plaque reads: \\"George Karl (Charles) Ludwig Preuss, \\"Fremont‚Äôs Cartographer\\", 1803‚Äì1854. Charles Preuss was born in Hohsheid (Prussia, now Germany) in 1803. After studying the science of geodesy, he became a surveyor for the Prussian government. After moving to the United States he worked for the Coast Survey under Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler. In 1838, when funds for this Survey ran out, Preuss found himself unemployed. Hassler recommended Preuss to John Charles Fremont, a young 2nd lieutenant who was preparing an expedition exploring the lands between the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers. Preuss was hired on to reduce astronomical observations from this 1839 Nicollet survey. Preuss failed at this but proved himself a fine artist; keeping a daily map of the route. In 1842 Fremont was preparing an expedition out of St. Louis to map the Pacific Northwest and kept Preuss employed. Preuss was 39 by this time, red-faced and ill-humored. They were a badly matched pair, but Preuss played perfect counterpoint to Fremont. If Fremont saw the poetry in the unfolding landscapes around him, Preuss saw precise longitudes and latitudes. Preuss proved to be an important member of Fremont‚Äôs expeditions of 1842‚Äì44 and 1848 as well. The Fremont/Preuss maps of this period were the basis for all western maps of the following two decades. One author writing on the mapping of the Transmississippi West said, ‚ÄúThe 1845 Fremont/Preuss map changed the entire picture of the West, and made a lasting contribution to cartography.‚Äù\\"Topographical Engineer Wall of Fame.\\" 2007.

Dating back to the reign of Henry VIII (1509‚Äì1547) the current Grade II listed building was constructed in 1533 and retains its original brick and flint walls and oak beams. The interior is unchanged since around 1732 and includes tables crafted from the timbers of an 18th-century Thames barge.Chocks away: Richard Johnson downs a few incoming pints of Spitfire in Kent article from The Independent, 13 April 2002 An inscription on an ancient oak sideboard formerly found at the property reads: A Ryghte Joyouse and welcome greetynge too ye all, it is now located at Knole as it is inscribed with the names John Tufton, Earl of Thanet and Margaret Sackville (his wife) of Knole. History The history of the Ringlestone Inn has been researched by a number of previous owners and is broadly thought to be as follows:History of the Ringlestone Inn =Early history= Ringlestone or Rongostone (meaning \\"ring of stones\\") dates back to before the Norman conquest of England in 1066 and is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086.Ringlestone's entry in the Domesday Book at the National Archives Confusingly for research into the locality's history, \\"Ringleton\\" also cited in the Domesday Book (and appearing in the Kent Hundred Rolls of 1274 as \\"Ringlestone\\"),Kent Hundred Rolls by the Kent Archaeological Society was a manor near the Ringlemere barrow, Woodnesborough (also in Kent). In addition a suburb of the nearby town of Maidstone is also called \\"Ringlestone\\". Ringlestone Road showing Ringlestone Inn in the distance The present-day inn was originally a hospice, owned by the church for the sanctuary of monks, who are believed to have farmed the land surrounding the inn. In addition other medieval dwellings have been uncovered on the site. Around 1539, the monks are believed to have left (likely imprisoned or executed), following the dissolution of the monasteries ordered by Henry VIII. The inn is then referenced in a will dated 1588, when a Julius Papworth Quiller directed that > \\"my house at Rongoston and land thereto belonging be sold to pay my debts > and legacies\\". Accordingly, the property was auctioned off to a Septimus Hepplewhite, a wheelwright and cooper from the Parish of Hollingbourne. Hepplewhite operated a small cooperage from the site until his death in 1609, following which his wife and eldest son took over the house and cooperage business. Oliver Hepplewhite, under the direction of his mother, introduced the production and sale of ale to the property around 1615. In common with the times, local breweries (three are listed in the parish of Harrietsham during this period) would fund small drinking establishments to promote their products, such establishments, requiring a licence under the Ale Houses Act 1551, were known as 'ale-houses'. During the next 150 years, the inn grew in popularity and travellers stopped there for refreshment en route to and from London to the settlements of Kent. Samuel Cooper, a celebrated 17th century miniaturist, is said to have visited the house in 1656. A \\"Gentleman of the Road\\" (or highwayman) Elias Shepherd, known to have held up coaches between Faversham and Canterbury, is believed to have frequented the inn (Shepherd was captured at Charing and hanged at Penenden Heath in 1765).Given Penenden Heath's proximity to the present-day Maidstone suburb of Ringlestone, it is unclear whether documentary references uncovered by previous owners are to the Ringlestone hamlet or the area of greater-Maidstone. On Friday 1 March 1788, two smugglers, named John Roberts and Francis Whorlow who were both wanted for the murder of two dragoons and the smuggling of five-thousand gallons of genever (or Dutch) gin at Whitstable, were arrested at \\"Ringleton\\" and taken to Faversham gaol. In his defence at the Old Bailey, John Roberts provided the alibi that he was visiting his family at \\"Ringleton\\" at the time the murders took place. In the face of this evidence both men were acquitted. The owner of the Ringlestone Inn at the time is recorded as \\"Avery Roberts\\".It is not clear, however, that the \\"Ringleton\\" cited in the smuggler's defence is the present-day Ringlestone hamlet or the manor of Ringleton near Woodnesborough (which is some distance closer to Whitstable) and that the \\"Roberts\\" connection may simply be coincidence. The name Rongoston has evolved since the time the Inn was built. This is believed to be due to mispronunciation over the course of time. In 1822 the house became known as the Renglestone and a sign hung announcing it. The Inn continued to be known as such until 1867 when it was changed, for the final time, to the present-day Ringlestone Inn. =20th Century to present day= At least from 1901 1901 census until his death in 1905,England & Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858-1966 the innkeeper was Henry Brooks Bates. It is not known when he first became innkeeper but from the censuses available it was between 1891 and 1901. In 1913 Charles Alfred Rayfield took over the inn. Rayfield was the father of Charles 'Gunner' Rayfield, the soldier who may have fired the first artillery shot against the Germans in the First World War. In 1958 Florence (Ma) and Dora Gasking (who were mother and daughter) took over the inn. Building a notorious reputation they were frequently armed with a shotgun, inspecting their clientele and requiring unwanted guests to leave. They are also said to have thrown concrete blocks from the windows and required a speakeasy-style series of secret knocks to gain entry to the pub. Their behaviour is believed to stem from an occasion when the inn was inundated by around 300 bikers.From an article appearing in the Kent Messenger, 11 March 1977 From the late 20th century to 2018, the inn has largely operated as a public house and restaurant and was purchased by Kent brewers, Shepherd Neame in 2005. As of May 2018 the inn was closed, with poor online reviews cited as a cause, and the building was being prepared for auction. Kent Messenger Group online Interior images of the inn were used as locations in the filming of an episode of EastEnders broadcast in the United Kingdom over the Easter 2007 holiday season.Eastenders visit Kent from Kent Film Office August 2019 saw the Ringlestone Inn open its doors once again after an 18 month closure and refurbishment, and is now a free house and restaurant as it once was. New owners Dalton Hopper and Paolo Rigolli have undertaken extensive work whilst retaining all original brickwork. Paranormal activity  The inn's long-history has resulted in a number of reports of supposed paranormal or supernatural activity:Ringlestone Inn at Ghosts.org.ukA study in paranormal activity at the Ringlestone Inn *Patrons and owners have described seeing an elderly couple regularly drinking near the house's inglenook fireplace. *A further apparition is said to walk up the cellar steps, halting at the top and removing one boot which is then thrown to the floor, however the figure never takes off the other boot. *Maintenance or renovations of the property by various owners and live-in staff have also allegedly resulted in paranormal activity. *Children have been said to appear in the inn, behaving mischievously. One owner noted a small boy who appeared to vanish through a wall which, it was later found out, was originally a doorway. The owner's family subsequently learned that a young boy, who had lived upstairs, had previously died at the inn. A story promoted by previous owners concerns a small boy - possibly the son of the landlord at the time - who was allegedly caught poaching on the surrounding farm land. At that time the penalty was harsh - being imprisonment or possibly death. In order to protect their son, the innkeepers decided to conceal the child for a time from the local farmers and constabulary. The child was said to have been put in a small cavity in an old fireplace in the cellar with a brick wall built in front to shield him and a small hole left through which to feed him. Eventually the food stopped being taken, so the father inserted the last brick. The wall has supposedly not been disturbed since the couple, now childless, left the Ringlestone.

Post- military  =Disbandment= The mainly San 31 Battalion was disbanded on 7 March 1993 shortly before 32 Battalion was disbanded on 26 March 1993. Willem Ratte and his men wanted to hand over 30 one rand coins to President F.W. de Klerk in parliament as a symbol of what was described as \\"Judas treachery for the total disbandment of former black Portuguese speaking soldiers who fought Marxism\\" in the South African Border War. The bag of coins and list of fallen 32 Battalion members could not be handed over directly in parliament and was given to Dr Willie Snyman the leader for the Conservative Party for Pietersburg. President de Klerk refused to accept the bag and the list from him and it was seized and held in parliament. =Fort Schanskop ‚Äì 1993/1994= On 16 December 1993 Willem Ratte led the paramilitary \\"Pretoria Boere Commando\\" to occupy Pretoria's Fort Schanskop, an old German designed Fort completed in 1897, to mark the anniversary of the Day of the Vow. The armed protest and occupation was their objection to a multi-racial government at the cost of Boer and Afrikaner heritage. Fort Schanskop being symbolic of their heritage as it was built to ward off the British by the Boers and Afrikaners in 1899 before the Anglo Boer War. While the Fort was being occupied by Willem Ratte and the Pretoria Boere Commando, the government called in General Constand Viljoen and Kobus Visser to end the occupation and to get them to surrender. Ratte and 2 others of the Pretoria Boere Commando refused to surrender and escaped from the Fort that night even while encircled by the South African National Defense Force and South African Police. Those who chose to hand themselves over had not been arrested on weapons charges as all their firearms had been licensed. Two days later Willem Ratte broadcast from Radio Donkerhoek stating that he would not surrender. A few days after the incident at Fort Schanskop a locked door was forced open by police and explosives found. During the subsequent trial the police could not connect Willem Ratte to the explosives. They were all later tried and convicted for the illegal armed occupation. Ratte refused to acknowledge the validity of the court and did not speak in his defense. Judge M.C. De Witt, sentenced him to 20 years, of which 15 years were suspended. Reaction from the South African media was mixed. The issue of heritage was repeated in the speech given by Willem Ratte in 1995 with regards to the illegal armed occupation of Fort Schanskop when he pointed to the English speaking press saying: =Radio Donkerhoek ‚Äì 1994/95= Radio Donkerhoek was also called the Boer Resistance Radio by its broadcasters. There had been much opposition to the granting of the broadcasting license for Radio Donkerhoek as the stated goal for the radio station was to further the culture and heritage of the Boer and Afrikaner. The delegates at the IBA hearing made it clear that Radio Donkerhoek would also push for a volkstaat and that black Afrikaans speakers would not be allowed to join the channel. Radio Vryheid, Radio Donkerhoek, Radio Koppies, Radio Volkstem and Radio Pretoria had been started in 1994 by the Pretoria Boere Commando and the Afrikaner Volksfront (AVF) and operated without licenses. The South African government viewed them as 'pirate' radio stations however they were the first community based radio stations in South African history. Radio Pretoria went off-air and got its license in 1995 however Radio Donkerhoek was still broadcasting through this time without a license. Police only acted when the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Authority) filed a complaint. The South African Defence Force and police swooped on the station. Willem Ratte and his 4-year-old daughter and another two had locked themselves inside. Willem Ratte stated to police that they could get the equipment over his dead body. They negotiated a settlement that the South African Defence Force and the police would withdraw on condition that the police open a crime docket to investigate Radio Donkerhoek. =Shell House Massacre ‚Äì 1994/1995= The Shell House massacre occurred in 1994 which was a shooting incident that took place at the headquarters of the African National Congress (ANC), in central Johannesburg, South Africa in the lead up to the 1994 elections. In 1995 Willem Ratte laid a complaint of murder against president Nelson Mandela at the Police headquarters in Pretoria for the Shell House Massacre where ANC members shot at Zulu protestors from the roof top of their headquarters at Shell House after Nelson Mandela had ordered that Shell House be protected even if it means killing civilians. =Save Willem Ratte Campaign ‚Äì 1996= Willem Ratte and others started serving their 5-year sentences for the occupation of Fort Schanskop in 1993. In June 1996 a grouping called the \\"Friends of Willem Ratte\\" started protests around the country demanding his release. In 1996 the matter of his sentence and his hunger strike was brought before parliament again by General Constand Viljoen. Members of parliament had objected to the \\"Save Willem Ratte Campaign\\" as they viewed it as agitating and counter- productive to his release. Mass action moved forward in the campaign and amongst other protests the N1 (National Road) near Pretoria was blockaded for 2 hours. Nelson Mandela responded by condemning the protests in parliament and stating that no government could respond to such demands of release. During the course of 1996 a number of snap debates took place in parliament with regards to the release of Willem Ratte. In June 1996 more than 1,000 'right- wingers' descended on Pretoria Central Prison demanding his release. From there the protests moved to City Hall and they were joined by Eugene Terreblanche who arrived on horseback. The following day the protests continued with the burning of the South African flag while blaming the South African media for the current 'communist' regime of the ANC running the country. On 20 June 1996 the South African government again turned down the plea from the Freedom Front to release Willem Ratte. =Post-1996 ‚Äì present= In 2010 Willem Ratte was again arrested and faced charges of illegal possession of dagga, unlicensed firearms and ammunition. He embarked on a hunger strike from 1 October 2010 to 1 November 2010 in jail. He was released on R2,000 bail. A charge of obstruction of justice had later been laid against the investigating officers in the case as they could not find any evidence for the arrest and had continually made new charges to hold him in custody. All charges were later withdrawn by the state.

The Algerine class was armed with a QF Mk V anti-aircraft gunChesneau, p. 65 and four twin-gun mounts for Oerlikon 20 mm cannon. The latter guns were in short supply when the first ships were being completed and they often got a proportion of single mounts. By 1944, single-barrel Bofors 40 mm mounts began replacing the twin 20 mm mounts on a one for one basis. All of the ships were fitted for four throwers and two rails for depth charges. Construction The vessel was put on order from the Redfern Construction Company's shipyard in Toronto in November 1942. She was laid down on 30 October 1943, launched 16 February 1944 and completed 14 October the same year. Originally built for the Royal Canadian Navy as HMCS Tillsonburg, she was transferred on completion to the Royal Navy as HMS Flying Fish. This was part of an exchange programme, whereby the RCN received British-built Castle- class corvettes, as they needed escort vessels rather than minesweepers at that stage of the conflict. The name Tillsonburg was given to one of the new corvettes. Career =As HMS Flying Fish= HMS Flying Fish was commissioned into the Royal Navy in October 1944. She had an uneventful career as a minesweeper until the end of hostilities. After the war she was given to Ceylon on indefinite loan by Britain in 1949 at Singapore with a formal transfer in Colombo. =As HMCyS Vijaya= When the Royal Ceylon Navy was formed in 1951 it became the first warship of the navy and was named after the first King of the Island. The First Sri Lankan Captain on the vessel was Lieutenant Commander (later Rear Admiral) Rajan Kadiragamar MVO, ADC, RCyN. From 1949 Vijaya became the training platform for the new navy and began undertaking anti-smuggling and anti-illicit immigration patrols in coastal waters. In May 1951 she sailed to Maldives with Sir John Kotelawala, Minister for Transport and Works and his party for a short visit. Next year she paid another call to participate in the Proclamation of the Maldivian Republic. In 1952 she sailed to Britain to represent the Royal Ceylon Navy at the fleet review on the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Although she did not take part in the fleet review due to repairs, the Royal Navy lent a ship of the same class for the RCyN for the review with the name Vijaya II. ‚ÄúVijaya‚Äù undertook her second visit to Burma in 1955, carrying a group of persons to participate in the ‚ÄúChatta Sangayana‚Äù. ‚ÄúVijaya‚Äù undertook several training and operational tasks, including, a visit to Port Blair in the Andaman Islands with VNF officers and sailors (1954), a visit to Male with VNF officers and sailors (1954), a training cruise to Bombay and Karachchi (1954), a visit to Madras with VNF officers and sailors (1955), a visit to Cochin on a Minesweeping exercise (1955). Vijaya ran aground during a cyclone in the Gulf of Mannar in December 1964. She was scrapped in 1975.

Early life  Ride was born in Newstead, Victoria. He was the fifth child of Australian-born parents William Ride and Eliza Mary (n√©e Best). His father was a pioneering Presbyterian missionary and his mother the daughter of a stonemason. Education and WWI Ride attended three state schools in the country before being awarded a scholarship to Scotch College, Melbourne. There, he excelled in sport and won a senior government scholarship. On 14 February 1917, Ride enlisted in the AIF. Early in 1918, he joined the 38th Battalion on the Western Front. He was twice wounded, once seriously. Subsequently, on 24 April 1919, he was 'invalided out' of the army. Medical studies Ride enrolled in medicine at the University of Melbourne. There he took an active interest in sport by participating in rifle shooting, athletics, rowing, cricket and football. He was the president of the Students' Representative Council from 1921 to 1922. Ride was elected Victorian Rhodes scholar for 1922. At New College, Oxford, 'Blue' Ride as he was known, became captain of boats and steward of the junior common-room. With only mediocre academic results, authorities were nevertheless impressed to the point that they rated him 'a good Rhodes Scholar' and a 'first rate fellow'. =Becoming a surgeon= He worked at Guy's Hospital and qualified as a member of the Royal College of Surgeons, as well as a licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians, London. Marriage On 30 June 1925, in Church of Scotland tradition, Ride married Canadian Mary Margaret Louise Fenety at St Columba's Church, Chelsea, London. Life in Hong Kong Perhaps because of his natural ability for medical research, he was appointed professor of physiology at The University of Hong Kong on 21 October 1928. There, 'Doc' Ride as he was known, investigated in the blood groups of the peoples of the Pacific. In 1938, he wrote the book \\"Genetics and the Clinician\\", published in Bristol, England. Ride was commissioned in the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Corps and was appointed a justice of the peace. He was a keen rower and played for the Hong Kong Cricket Club. Ride became an elder in the Union Church. Possessing the voice of a baritone, he helped to found the Hong Kong Singers in 1934. =WWII and the Battle of Hong Kong= Lindsay Ride escaped from Japanese-occupied Hong Kong (i) on 9 January 1942. He reached Huizhou (ii), Kukong (iii), Guilin (iv), and finally arriving at Chongqing (v) on 17 February 1942. The red boundaries denote the Japanese-occupied area in China as of late 1941. Ride sent his wife and children to Australia in 1938 in anticipation of a Japanese invasion into the British colony. In 1941, Ride commanded the Hong Kong Field Ambulance. He became a POW and was held in the prison established by the Japanese at the Sham Shui Po Barracks after Hong Kong capitulated on Christmas Day, 1941. On 9 January 1942, with the help of Hong Kong guerilla forces, he managed to escape to unoccupied Chungking, a feat for which he was appointed O. B. E. in 1942. While a colonel in the Indian Army, Ride formed and commanded the British Army Aid Group, headquartered in Kweilin, Kwangsi. This MI9 unit provided help, medical and otherwise, to POW escapees from Hong Kong while gathering intelligence. Due to his outstanding leadership after escaping, 'The Smiling Tiger' as he was nicknamed, was elevated to C. B. E. in 1944. From the formation in 1949 of the Royal Hong Kong Defence Force Ride was appointed commandant, first with the rank of Colonel, subsequently promoted to the rank of Brigadier in 1956, until his retirement in 1967. =Life as Vice Chancellor= Ride was appointed vice-chancellor to a dilapidated, post-war University of Hong Kong in April 1949. 22 new buildings were erected and student numbers increased threefold in the 15 years after his appointment. He had been described as decisive, genial and authoritarian all at the same time. Ride enjoyed unwavering support among older staff but his paternalistic tendencies failed to endear him to staff who were appointed in later years.

In 1992, Kolodner was elected a fellow in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) for \\"pioneering research on case-based reasoning and learning, including memory organization, information retrieval, problem solving, and knowledge acquisition.\\"Elected AAAI Fellows Kolodner's research addresses issues in learning, memory, and problem solving, both in computers and in people. She pioneered the computer reasoning method called case-based reasoning, a way of solving problems based on analogies to past experiences, and her lab emphasized case-based reasoning for situations of real-world complexity. In case-based reasoning, the results of previous cases are applied to new situations, cutting down the complexity of the reasoning necessary in later situations and allowing a problem solver to anticipate and avoid previously-made mistakes. Automated case-based reasoners from her lab include MEDIATOR and PERSUADER, common sense and expert mediation programs; JULIA, a case-based design problem solver; CELIA, a case-based car mechanic; MEDIC, a case-based physician; and EXPEDITOR, a case-based logistics manager. Kolodner's classic work in this area, Case-based Learning (1993), has been cited thousands of times by researchers.Case-Based Learning Her research interests are the implications and applications of cognition to education and educational technology, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, case-based reasoning, novice-expert evolution, the role of experience in expert and common-sense reasoning, design cognition, creativity, design of decision- aiding tools, and interactive learning environments. =Publications= Kolodner has published the following books: * Kolodner, J.

Brown was born in Colchester, England and joined the CMS at the age of 20. He was ordained as a priest on 1 June 1828 by the Bishop of London. He married his first wife Charlotte Arnett in 1829.Missionary Register 1829 They sailed for Sydney, New South Wales on 25 April 1829 on the Elizabeth. The couple arrived at Paihia on board the City of Edinburgh on 29 November 1829. Although an ordained priest, Brown was sent to New Zealand to instruct the children of the mission families in the Bay of Islands. Charlotte, who had been a teacher in Islington, London, taught the girls from the Paihia mission station. They were at Kerikeri in 1830. A son, Alfred Marsh, was born in Paihia on 22 June 1831. From 6 February to 17 May 1834, Brown and James Hamlin walked through the Auckland and Waikato regions. He and John Alexander Wilson were appointed to open a mission station in Matamata early in 1834. In the same year, he opened Te Papa mission station at Tauranga. In 1835, Te Waharoa, the leader of the NgƒÅti HauƒÅ iwi (MƒÅori tribe) of the Matamata region, lead his warriors against neighbouring tribes to avenge the death of a relative, with the fighting, which continued into 1836, extended from Rotorua, Matamata to Tauranga. After a house at the Rotorua mission was ransacked, both the Rotorua mission and the Matamata mission was not considered to be safe and the wives of the missionaries were escorted to Puriri and Tauranga. Wilson and the other CMS missionaries attempted to bring peace to the belligerents. In late March 1836, a war party lead by Te Waharoa arrived at Tauranga and the missionary families boarded the Columbine as a safety precaution on 31 March. They spend 1837 in the Bay of Islands. Alfred and Charlotte's daughter, Marianne Celia, was born in the Bay of Islands on 25 April 1837. In January 1838 Brown re-opened the Te Papa mission station. In 1937 the missionaries at Te Papa Mission were Brown, James Stack and Wilson. In 1846 he was assisted by the Rev. C.P. Davies. Bishop Selwyn appointed Brown Archdeacon of Tauranga on 31 December 1843. Marsh Brown was sent to St John's Collegiate School at Waimate North, Bay of Islands, in March 1844. In April he suffered an accident which resulted in an illness, probably erysipelas. He never recovered, and died at Te Papa on 14 September 1845. He was buried in the mission cemetery. Brown's work as a missionary flourished throughout the 1840s. He travelled widely throughout his archdeaconry often spending several weeks away from home as he visited Maori villages throughout the Bay of Plenty and Taupo regions. However, as conditions changed in the 1850s with increasing immigration, the influence of the missionaries began to decline. Charlotte died on 12 November 1855 in Auckland at the age of 59. She is buried in St Stephen's Churchyard, Parnell. Brown's daughter, Celia, married Rev. John Kinder in December 1859. Brown himself remarried on 18 February 1860, to Christina Johnston, sister of Wellington Supreme Court Judge Alexander Johnston. Although most of Brown's converts drifted away after the battles of Gate Pa and Te Ranga in 1864, he still considered himself to be a missionary. He and Christina purchased 17 acres of land around the Te Papa mission station from the CMS in 1873, renaming the property \\"The Elms\\", by which name it is still known today. Alfred Nesbit Brown died on 7 September 1884. He is buried in the mission cemetery, Tauranga, with his second wife Christina, who died on 26 June 1887.

Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 7 Oxford University Press 2006 Production zone The vineyards may be located within the boundaries of the following communes of the Province of Avellino: Taurasi, Bonito, Castelfranci, Castelvetere sul Calore, Fontanarosa, Lapio, Luogosano, Mirabella Eclano, Montefalcione, Montemarano, Montemiletto, Paternopoli, Pietradefusi, Sant'Angelo all'Esca, San Mango sul Calore, Torre Le Nocelle and Venticano. The total area is about and is situated on volcanic soil. Winemaking The Aglianico grape thrives on vineyards at higher altitudes, around 400 to 500 meters above sea level. According to DOCG regulations, Taurasi wines must be aged a minimum of 3 years prior to release with at least 1 of those years being in wood. For wines labeled Riserva, the wines must be aged for at least 4 years. The wines are made primarily from Aglianico though up to 15% of Barbera, Piedirosso and Sangiovese maybe be blended in.T.

It was the first of 23 fire lookout towers built by the state in the region, and the next-to-last of the five still standing to be abandoned. Today it remains a popular attraction for hikers climbing the mountain. After it fell into disrepair in the 1990s and was recommended for removal by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which had operated the tower, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Local enthusiasts were able to raise money, matched by DEC, to restore the tower and adjacent observer's cabin to serve as a museum, with volunteers in the cab on some weekends. Panoramic views of not only the mountains but the adjacent Hudson Valley, Massachusetts, Connecticut and sometimes southwestern Vermont are available from it. Likewise, it can be seen from many of the surrounding mountains, the village of Hunter and the upper slopes of the ski area. It is the highest fire tower still standing in the state and the second- highest in the entire Northeast. History =Catskill fire protection before towers= When the Catskill Park was created in 1885, one of the state's earliest missions was the control and suppression of forest fires which had long ravaged the land and damaged local crops and property. Wardens were hired to patrol railroad lines, where stray ashes from steam engines often ignited surrounding brush,Ibid., 14. and investigate reports of fires started by logging or quarrying operations on state land (illegal under the legislation that created New York's Forest Preserve, now Article 14 of the state constitution).Ibid., 11. But the Forest, Fish and Game Commission, DEC's predecessor, was hopelessly understaffed and could not even begin to focus on fire prevention. Severe fires during droughts in 1903 and 1908 caused thousands of dollars in damages and led to public calls for better fire control efforts. In December of the latter year, James Whipple, head of the state's Forest, Fish and Game Commission (FFGC, a predecessor agency of DEC), began looking into what could be done. His counterpart in Maine, E.E. Ring, wrote back to one of his inquiries highly recommending the use of strategically placed observation towers similar to the nine his state had already installed.Ibid., 12. \\"In my opinion, one man located at a station will do far more effectual work in discovering and locating fires than a hundred men already patrolling,\\" he said.Forest, Fish and Game Commission of the State of New York Report 1908, Albany: J.B. Lyon, State Printers, 1909, 45-46, cited at Podskosch, 12. alt=A black and white photograph of a triangular wooden tower with an open top deck, with some evergreen trees in the foreground. Several men are standing on top of it. =Tower construction and relocation= The FFGC realized that informal observation towers already in existence on some summits were excellent places to station trained observers, who could see vast portions of the range and report the location of new fires quickly via dedicated telephone lines. The area around Hunter had historically been very fire-prone, due to heavy logging (less than of virgin forest remains on the mountain) and lightning strikes. The following year, forest rangers built the first Hunter Mountain fire tower, a structure made from three trees, on level ground near the summit. It was one of the first fire lookout towers in the Catskills. Observers stood on an open platform and at first had to live in a nearby tent, until a cabin was built. Eight years later it was replaced with a more permanent steel tower, the current structure, by what was then the Conservation Commission. It was hauled in sections up the dirt road from Spruceton (now the Spruceton Trail) with a team of horses. At the top was an enclosed cab complete with a map, field glasses and the telephone. In 1953, it and the cabin were moved northwest along the ridge to the mountain's true summit, where it remains today (footings of the original tower are still visible at the trail junction where it stood). At an elevation of above sea level it is the highest fire tower in the state and second-highest in the entire Northeast after Avery Peak on Maine's Mount Bigelow. =Abandonment and revival= Observations continued, but fire danger declined over the years along with the industries that had caused many early fires. Airplane flights supplemented the work of the observers, and the public showed greater vigilance in reporting new blazes.Ibid., 113. DEC finally closed the tower in 1989. It remained open and accessible to the hiking public, however. In the 1990s, a DEC forester's recommendation in a draft planning document that another of the remaining firetowers be dismantled and removed as a nonconforming structure triggered (as he had hoped) a movement to save them. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it. In 1996, Hunter and the other four towers were added to the Historic Lookout Register, and then to the National Register the following year. Local committees raised money for their repair, and on October 7, 2000 DEC formally reopened the Hunter tower to the public as observation towers with interpretive materials, including an alidade in the tower cab. Two decades later, DEC initiated a $48,000 renovation program. The roof, which had been damaged by wind during the winter of 2016‚Äì17, was replaced along with the grates around the tower landings, the tower repainted, and the windows in the cab repaired. A celebration was held in August 2017 to mark the tower's 100th anniversary. Site The tower is located near the center of the small clearing left by early 20th-century logging operations. It is surrounded on all sides by tall balsam fir and red spruce, the dominant tree species in the boreal forest found at high elevations in the Catskills. The observer's cabin, with a small protected porch, is just to the southeast. Its windows are covered in steel mesh to protect it from porcupines, abundant in the Catskill forests, which chew on the wood. There have been other structures at the site. One observer's son recalls that the state built his father a garage to protect his truck from the porcupines.Podskosch, op. cit., 34. Catskill forest historian Michael Kudish reports that a small shed near the cabin was removed in the early to mid-1990s.Kudish, op. cit., 122. As part of the renovations, DEC installed a pit privy in the nearby woods. Later that decade it improved the Spruceton Trail to better allow the equestrian use it already permitted. It added a hitching rack, drinking barrel and mounting chute at the summit near the tower, corresponding with similar facilities elsewhere along the trail and at the trailhead. =Access= The old truck road, now the blue-blazed Spruceton Trail, is the most common route to the tower. Horses and riders may use it, and it can be traveled in the winter with snowshoes or cross-country skis. Most visitors come from the west, away, where it leaves Spruceton Road and climbs vertically more than to the summit. Along the way it picks up traffic from the ski area, which operates its summit chairlift in the summer months, via the Colonel's Chair Trail. A short yellow-blazed spur from the steep Becker Hollow Trail comes in from the north as well, but it is infrequently used. From the east, at Stony Clove Notch, the Devil's Path climbs to the junction with another short trail, the Hunter Mountain Trail, which in turn climbs to the junction with the Spruceton and Becker Hollow trails at the pre-1953 tower site. The area has long been part of the Hunter Mountain Wild Forest, a New York-specific class of protected area that allows for slightly higher-impact recreational uses than wilderness. Recent proposed changes to the Catskill State Land Master Plan would keep the Spruceton Trail within a small wild forest corridor while merging much of the remaining land with the nearby West Kill Wilderness Area, in order to allow for other possible uses of the trail, such as mountain biking. =View= Hunter, like many other Catskill peaks, has a wide flat summit covered with forest. Since the entire Catskill range is below tree-line, 360-degree views are extremely rare. The only ones available are from the fire towers. Due to Hunter's dominance of the northern Catskills, many of the peaks in that region can be seen. The distinctive comb of the Blackhead Range, the third through fifth highest Catskill peaks, can be seen to the north, and to the northeast Kaaterskill High Peak adds another of the Catskills' most recognizable shapes. Less recognizable from this angle are the Devil's Path peaks to the east. South of Hunter can be seen officially-unnamed Southwest Hunter, known as a difficult bushwhack due to the difficulty of finding the summit register. The central Catskill peaks around Slide Mountain, the highest Catskill peak, can be seen on reasonably clear days, and closer to Hunter fellow Catskill High Peaks West Kill and Rusk stand out to the southwest and west. The ski area's summit station, chairlift and trails are also visible.

The guitar is available in two models, Upgrade and Standard, and both were designed by American country-rock guitarist James Burton along with Dan Smith at Fender. Both models are patterned after mid-century Fender Telecaster guitars played by Burton during his long career with Ricky Nelson, Elvis Presley,(James was hesitant to play the now infamous Fender Telecaster pink paisley guitar because it was thought was too bright, Elvis's guys persuaded him to play it live on stage with Elvis and Elvis loved it and wanted him to play it all the time on stage.)Merle Haggard, Emmylou Harris, John Denver and many other well-known artists. James Burton Telecaster Upgrade 239px The original Upgrade was introduced in 1991 and had a poplar body, three Lace Sensor pickups (models Blue at the neck, Silver in the middle and Red at the bridge) and a treble/bass expander (TBX) tone control. The TBX was a dual function stacked potentiometer tone control. From settings 1 to 5, the TBX responded like a normal tone control and routed the signal through a 250k pot with a shunt .022uF capacitor to cut treble. Settings 6 to 10 routed the signal directly through a 1 meg pot which supposedly cut bass, although how this was to be accomplished without a series capacitor remains a mystery. This model was available in Black/Gold Paisley, Black/Candy Red Paisley, Pearl White and Frost Red. The current Upgrade model features a solid basswood body finished in solid Olympic Pearl, or with a flame design in Red Paisley or Blue Paisley on a black background. This model is based on a 1969 Paisley Red model Telecaster (popularly called Pink Paisley) that Burton played while touring with Elvis Presley from 1969 to 1977. The neck is the same as the Standard model. The electronics include three specially designed James Burton blade single-coil pickups (mounted similar to the Stratocaster layout) and a 5-way \\"Strat-o-Tele\\" pickup selector with an S-1 switching system that allows a wide variety of pickup tones. The hardware includes a gold-plated hard-tail Strat bridge, gold-plated Schaller die-cast tuners with black or pearl buttons and gold-plated tone and volume knobs. The current Upgrade model was designed to commemorate a 2005 benefit concert for the James Burton Foundation in Shreveport, Louisiana. This model is made in USA. James Burton Standard Telecaster The Standard model of the James Burton Telecaster was introduced in 1996 and features a solid alder body finished in Two-Tone-Sunburst or Candy Apple Red with a 1-ply white pickguard. This model was inspired by Burton's third guitar, the 1953 Telecaster that he played on the seminal 1957 recording of \\"Susie Q\\" with Dale Hawkins. The neck is a 1-piece maple 1960s vintage U-shape design with a satin finish and 1950s-style decals. The hardware includes a vintage six-saddle Telecaster bridge, a pair of Texas Special Tele single-coil pick ups, a three-way switch and vintage chrome Ping tuners. This instrument is made in Mexico.

She was of Ojibwa and Scots-Irish ancestry. Her Ojibwa name can also be written as O-bah-bahm-wawa-ge-zhe-go-qua (Obabaamwewe-giizhigokwe in modern spelling), meaning \\"Woman of the Sound [that the stars make] Rushing Through the Sky.\\" She lived most of her life in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Early life and education Jane Johnston was born in Sault Ste. Marie in the upper peninsula of what is now the state of Michigan. Her mother, Ozhaguscodaywayquay, was the daughter of Waubojeeg, a prominent Ojibwa war chief and civil leader from what is now northern Wisconsin, and his wife. Her father John Johnston (1762‚Äì1828) was a fur trader who emigrated from Belfast, Ireland in 1790. The Johnstons are famous historically in the Sault Ste. Marie area, where the couple were prominent leaders in both the Euro-American and the Ojibwa communities. The young Jane learned the Ojibwe language and culture from her mother and her family, and she learned about written literature from her father and his large library. Writing Johnston wrote poetry and traditional Ojibwa stories, and she translated Ojibwa songs into English. She mostly wrote in English, but she wrote several poems in the Ojibwe language, as she lived her daily life in both Ojibwe and English. While she did not publish her work, she lived a literary life with her husband Henry Rowe Schoolcraft. They worked together closely on each of their writings. Her poetry was generally concerned with private life.Robert Dale Parker, Jane Johnston Schoolcraft, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, accessed 11 Dec 2008 Jane Schoolcraft‚Äôs writings have attracted considerable interest from scholars and students, especially those concerned with Native American literature and history. She has been recognized as \\"the first Native American literary writer, the first known Indian woman writer, the first known Indian poet, the first known poet to write poems in a Native American language and the first known American Indian to write out traditional Indian stories.\\" Her role in the Native American literary canon has been compared to that of Anne Bradstreet in the \\"broader American literary canon.\\" Marriage and family In 1823 Jane married Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, a US Indian agent in the region, who became a founding figure of American cultural anthropology.Jeremy Mumford, \\"Mixed-Race Identity in a Nineteenth-Century Family: The Schoolcrafts of Sault Ste.

In 1826 and 1827, Henry Schoolcraft produced a handwritten magazine called The Literary Voyager which included some of Jane‚Äôs writings. Although he had only single issues, each was distributed widely to residents in Sault Ste. Marie, then to his friends in Detroit, New York and other eastern cities.Schoolcraft: Literary Voyager or Muzziegun, ed. by Philip Mason, East Lansing: Michigan State University, 1962, full text online The Schoolcrafts' letters to each other during periods of separation often included poetry, also expressing how literature was part of their daily lives. Henry Schoolcraft won fame for his later publications about Native Americans, especially the Ojibwe people and their language (also known as Chippewa and Anishinaabemowin). His work was based on information and stories he learned from Jane and the Johnston family, and the access they arranged to other Ojibwe. In 1846, he was commissioned by the United States Congress for what became a six-volume study known as Indian Tribes of the United States.

This permits test access to boards on which standard ICT test pads are not feasible due to space constraints. Description Bead probe technology is a probing method used to connect electronic test equipment to the device under test (DUT) within a bed of nails fixture. The technique was first used in the 1990sSurface Mount & Mixed Technology PCB Design Guidelines by David Boswell. Page 28 and originally given the name ‚ÄúWaygood Bump‚Äù after one of the main proponents, Rex Waygood. They are also commonly referred to as solder bumps.Surface Mount Technology ‚Äì Principles and Practices 2nd Edition by Ray. P Prasad Page 332 Bead probes were designed for when less than 30 mil is available for test probe points on the PCB. They are used with standard ICT spring-loaded test probes to connect the test equipment to the DUT. Side view of a PCB showing a solder bead and test probe. Bead construction Bead probes are made from a very small \\"beads\\" of solder that fit atop of the PCB traces. They are manufactured using the same techniques as other solder features. Construction requires a hole to be opened in the solder mask, exposing the copper trace. This hole is sized to precisely control the amount of metal that forms the bead. Solder paste is applied to the location and reflowed. During reflow, solder flows and is drawn to the copper trace. Surface tension causes the bead to have a curved surface and rise above the solder mask, where it solidifies into a Bead Probe. The bead will be roughly obround in shape and may be 15-25 mils long. A properly constructed bead is the same width as the trace and just enough to clear the surrounding solder mask. The bead is then accessible for testing using a probe with a flat end, which can help compensate for the tolerance build up in the test fixture and PCB. reflow and then probed successfully Advantages Bead probe can be used in circuits where the pin-pitch is too fine to allow standard test pads. This is becoming more common as pin pitches continue to reduce, particularly in embedded devices. Typically bead probe widths are the width of the PCB traces with a length of about three times this. This allows a high degree of flexibility in their positioning, and can in some cases be applied retrospectively to existing layouts. Because of their small size, bead probes do not affect the signal quality of the signals transferring within the PCB trace.A New Probing Technique for High-Speed/High-Density Printed Circuit Boards by Kenneth P. Parker of Agilent TechnologiesApplying a New In-Circuit Probing Technique for High-Speed/High Density Printed Circuit Boards to a Real-Life Product by Chris Jacobsen and Kevin Wible of Agilent Technologies This is especially useful in high speed input/output (HSIO) interconnects, where a standard test pad would interfere with the signal. Disadvantages * The soldering process that forms the bead probe leaves a coating of flux. Depending on the manufacturing process used, this flux can have varying levels of hardness. Flux with a waxy hardness can reduce the deformation force from the bead, preventing proper contact with the test probe during the first pass contact. This becomes less of an issue on subsequent contacts as the flux is displaced. Test probes with serrated ends of an appropriate size can also aid in measuring bead probes where flux is an issue. * Bead probes require the trace being tested to be located on the surface. This makes it unsuitable for testing high-density boards with many obscured or internal traces and buried vias. Alternatives * Boundary scan integrates test components into the integrated circuits (ICs) mounted on the board, giving the ability to read or drive the ICs' pins. This allows for testing of interconnects for which physical access is not an option, such as BGA components or signal routes sandwiched between plane layers. A boundary scan controller uses four or more dedicated pins on the board to control test cells serially and receive the measured values. It has the disadvantage of needing board infrastructure to support boundary scan. * Test Access Component (TAC) uses a device such as a 0201 as a target for a large probe as in the solder bump examples. The advantage of this technique is that it provides two target points at each end of the package. The disadvantage of this technique is it can add process and cost to the PCB.TEST ACCESS COMPONENT FOR AUTOMATIC TESTING OF CIRCUIT ASSEMBLIES United States Patent Application 20100207651 * A technique has been describedVAUCHER, C., Analog/Digital Testing of Loaded Boards Without Dedicated Test Points, Proceedings of the International Test Conference, IEEE 1996, pp. 325-32. which opens up windows in the solder mask to create test points located directly on PCB tracks.

He did, however, win that season's Hawthorn best and fairest, having won the award previously in 1932. In 1941 he quit the club after being dropped to the reserves side. He finished his playing career with Camberwell in the Victorian Football Association, but later returned to Hawthorn as coach of their thirds team in 1946. He also became an active committeeman (1947-1951-55) and he served as a club selector for more than a decade. In 2007, Stan Spinks was inducted into the Hawthorn Hall of Fame.

Each strand of DNA or RNA has a 5' end and a 3' end, so named for the carbon position on the deoxyribose (or ribose) ring. By convention, upstream and downstream relate to the 5' to 3' direction respectively in which RNA transcription takes place. Upstream is toward the 5' end of the RNA molecule and downstream is toward the 3' end. When considering double-stranded DNA, upstream is toward the 5' end of the coding strand for the gene in question and downstream is toward the 3' end. Due to the anti-parallel nature of DNA, this means the 3' end of the template strand is upstream of the gene and the 5' end is downstream. Some genes on the same DNA molecule may be transcribed in opposite directions.

The type II receptors phosphorylate the type I receptors; the type I receptors are then enabled to phosphorylate cytoplasmic R-Smads, which then act as transcriptional regulators. The upstream signaling pathway is triggered by the binding of a signaling molecule, a ligand, to a receiving molecule, a receptor. Receptors and ligands exist in many different forms, and they will only recognize/bond particular molecules. Upstream extracellular signaling transduce an endless variety of intracellular cascades. Receptors and ligands are common upstream signaling molecules that dictate the downstream elements of the signal pathway. A plethora of different factors affect which ligands bind to which receptors and the downstream cellular response that they initiate.  TGF-Œ≤  The extracellular type II and type I kinase receptors binding to the TGF-Œ≤ ligands. Transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) is a superfamily of cytokines that play a significant upstream role in regulating of Morphogenesis, Homeostasis, cell proliferation, and differentiation. The significance of TGF-Œ≤ is apparent with the human diseases that occur when TGF-Œ≤ processes are disrupted, such as cancer, and skeletal, intestinal and cardiovascular diseases. TGF-Œ≤ is pleiotropic and multifunctional, meaning they are able to act on a wide variety of cell types. = Mechanism = The effects of transforming growth factor-Œ≤ (TGF-Œ≤) are determined by cellular context. There are three kinds of contextual factors that determine the shape the TGF-Œ≤ response: the signal transduction components, the transcriptional cofactors and the epigenetic state of the cell. The different ligands and receptors of TGF-Œ≤ are significant as well in the composition signal transduction pathway. * the signal transduction components: ligand isoforms, ligand traps, co-receptors, receptor sub-types, inhibitory SMAD proteins, crosstalk inputs * the transcriptional cofactors of SMAD proteins: pluripotency factors, lineage regulators, DNA-binding cofactors, HATs and HDACs, SNF, chromatin readers * the epigenetic factors: heterochromatin, pluripotency marks, lineage marks, EMT marks, iPS cell marks, oncogenic marks. = Upstream pathway = The type II receptors phosphorylate the type I receptors; the type I receptors are then enabled to phosphorylate cytoplasmic R-Smads, which then act as transcriptional regulators. Signaling is initiated by the binding of TGF-Œ≤ to its serine/threonine receptors. The serene/threonine receptors are the type II and type I receptors on the cell membrane. Binding of a TGF-Œ≤ members induces assembly of a heterotetrameric complex of two type I and two type II receptors at the plasma membrane. Individual members of the TGF-Œ≤ family bind to a certain set of characteristic combination of these type I and type II receptors. The type I receptors can be divided into two groups, which depends on the cytoplasmic R-Smads that they bind and phosphorylate. The first group of type I receptors (Alk1/2/3/6) bind and activate the R-Smads, Smad1/5/8. The second group of type I reactors (Alk4/5/7) act on the R-Smads, Smad2/3. The phosphorylated R-Smads then form complexes and the signals are funneled through two regulatory Smad (R-Smad) channels (Smad1/5/8 or Smad2/3). After the ligand-receptor complexes phosphorylate the cytoplasmic R-Smads, the signal is then sent through Smad 1/5/8 or Smad 2/3.

This shark is related to another extinct megatoothed shark, Otodus megalodon.  Taxonomy  The Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz, first identified this shark as a species of genus Carcharodon in 1835. In 1964, shark expert, L. S. Glikman recognized the transition of Otodus obliquus to C. auriculatus and moved C. angustidens to genus Otodus. (See \\"external links\\" below) However, in 1987, shark expert H. Cappetta recognized the C. auriculatus - C. megalodon lineage and placed all related megatooth sharks along with this species in the genus Carcharocles. The complete Otodus obliquus to C. megalodon transition then became clear and has since gained the acceptance of many other experts with the passage of time. Within the Carcharocles lineage, C. angustidens is the species succeeding C. sokolovi and is followed by C. chubutensis. In 2001, a discovery of the best preserved Carcharocles angustidens specimen to date by two scientists, Michael D. Gottfried and Ewan Fordyce, has been presented by the team as evidence for close morphological ties with the extant great white shark, and the team argued that Carcharocles angustidens, along with all other related megatooth sharks, including Carcharocles megalodon, should be assigned to Carcharodon as was done before by Louis Agassiz., although this is not internationally accepted by the scientific community.  Size estimation  Like other known megatooth sharks, the fossils of O. angustidens indicate that it was considerably larger than the extant great white shark, Carcharodon carcharias. The well preserved specimen from New Zealand is estimated at in length. This specimen had teeth measuring up to in diagonal length, and vertebral centra around in diameter. However, reports of larger O. angustidens fossils have been made. A very large Otodus angustidens tooth, from author Max Hawthorne.  Dentition  The dental formula for O. angustidens is  Diet  O. angustidens was an apex predator and likely preyed upon penguins, fish, dolphins, and baleen whales.  Fossil record  As is the case with most extinct sharks, this species is also known from fossil teeth and some fossilized vertebral centra. Shark skeletons are composed of cartilage and not bone, and cartilage rarely gets fossilized. Hence, fossils of O. angustidens are generally poorly preserved. To date, the best preserved specimen of this species have been excavated from New Zealand, which comprises 165 associated teeth and about 35 associated vertebral centra. This specimen is around 26 million years old. O. angustidens teeth are noted for their triangular crowns and small side cusps that are fully serrated. The serrations are very sharp and very well pronounced. O. angustidens was a widely distributed species with fossils found in:Carcharocles angustidens at Fossilworks.org A fossil bed in South Carolina suggests that O. angustidens utilized the area as a birthing ground and nursery for their pups, as 89%of the teeth found in the area belonged to juveniles, 3% belonged to infants, and 8% belonged to adults.https://www.livescience.com/ancient-megatooth-shark- nursery.html?fbclid=IwAR11TabG- pary6d2aQCtHYb18x0aSRaQJEoOv7_XWu04-Viu4nJy8L00AhA ;North America * Yazoo Formation, Alabama * Jewett Sand Formation, California * Clinchfield Formation, Georgia * Calvert Formation, Maryland * Jackson Group, Mississippi * Kirkwood Formation, New Jersey * Castle Hayne Formation, North Carolina * Hawthorne Formation, South Carolina ;Europe * Malta * Paris Basin, France * Leipzig / Stoermthal, Germany ;Asia * Ashiya Group, Japan ;Oceania * Ettric, Jan Juc, Gambier Limestone, Clifton Formations, Australia * Otekaike Formation, New Zealand ;Africa ;South America * Dos Bocas Formation, Ecuador  See also  * Prehistoric fish * Largest prehistoric organisms  References   Further reading  * Glikman, L.S., 1980.

Born in Kaiserstuhl, Aargau, Suter studied in the conservatories at Basel, Stuttgart and Leipzig, under Hans Huber and Carl Reinecke. He was an organist and conductor in Zurich from 1892 to 1902, after which he moved to Basel, where he lived to his death. He was director of the Basel Conservatory from 1918 to 1921. One of his pupils at Basel was Richard Tauber who sang three of his songs at the Olten Music Festival in June 1912. Suter's compositions contain echoes of Brahms, Strauss, Mahler, and many other composers who Suter conducted at Basel. Much of his output is for chorus, both accompanied and unaccompanied; the best-known of his works is the oratorio Le Laudi (The Praises) or Le Laudi di San Francesco d'Assisi, based on the Canticle of the Sun, written in the summer of 1923 in Plaun da Lej, in Engadine, and premiered on 13 June 1924 in Basel. By 1930 the oratorio had been performed over eighty times in nearly as many cities. Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler led the Vienna premiere, and the work was acclaimed in Paris, Stockholm, Berlin, Hamburg, Leipzig, Cologne, and a host of smaller German cities. Other compositions include a symphony (1914), a violin concerto (1921), three string quartets (1901, 1910, 1921), a sextet for strings (1920), and numerous songs. *The first US performance of Le Laudi may have been in 1930 at St. Mark's Church, New York City. *The first professional performance of Le Laudi in the US was in June, 2000, at the Neal S.

Synopsis Seymour Sunshine and Knishkebibble the Monkey-Boy read an announcement by Alexander Crowley promising a reward \\"in excess of $1,000,000,000\\" to whoever can acquire one of the hummingbird pies baked by Cinnamon Jack, a blind man said to have murdered his own twin brother. The garrulous, impulsive Knishkebibble browbeats the mute, reluctant Seymour into joining him in an attempt to recover one of the pies. As the two approach Cinnamon Jack's cottage, they find it surrounded by the impaled heads of his victims. Jack, a scowling, heavyset man wearing dark glasses and carrying an oversized folding blade, stands in front of the doorway. When Knishkebibble rudely demands one of his pies, Jack cuts off Seymour's nose, then attacks Knishkebibble. Knishkebibble dodges Jack's swings and kills him by prying off most of his head from his jaw. He hands Seymour's nose back to him with a resigned sigh, and they enter the cottage. The two are disappointed to find the inside of Jack's single-room dwelling barren except for a bathtub, a mirror, and a bowl containing the remains of a small animal. While Knishkebibble amuses himself in the empty bathtub, Seymour looks into the mirror and is puzzled by the appearance of an orange dot in the center of his forehead. When he touches it he experiences a vision of his brain being removed from his skull, and shuts his eyes in fear. Reopening them, he finds a pale doppelg√§nger with pointed ears grinning at him in the mirror. Seymour flees across the room in a panic and runs into a wall, knocking himself unconscious. The doppelg√§nger climbs out of the mirror and capers about the room while transforming his body in strange ways. Turning his hand into a revolver, he shoots and kills Knishkebibble. Coming to, Seymour picks up a brick laying on the floor and throws it at the doppelg√§nger, but the projectile dissolves in a swarm of moths. The doppelg√§nger surprises Seymour by offering a handshake, which he hesitantly accepts, and telling him \\"Pleased to make your acquaintance.\\" As the two shake hands, the doppelg√§nger's hand transforms into a pair of clippers which cut Seymour's hand off at the wrist. Seymour glances down at his severed limb in alarm, then looks up to see the doppelg√§nger's head changing into a malevolent, serpentlike form as it moves towards him. The story ends enigmatically with a view of the cottage at dusk.

Early life Meneses was born in Santiago, the son of Jos√© Ignacio Meneses and of Micaela Echanes. He studied humanities, philosophy and law (both civil and canonic) at the Convictorio de San Carlos, and later graduated from the Universidad de San Felipe on August 29, 1804 as a doctor in \\"both sciences\\" (Doctor in Civil and Canonic Law.) In 1808 he married Carmen Bilbao, with whom he had several children. The same year he was named secretary to Royal Governor Francisco Garc√≠a Carrasco. After the dismissal of Governor Garc√≠a Carrasco, he was named legal and military aide to the Intendent of Concepci√≥n. When the Chilean independence movement swept the country, he joined the Royalist side. In 1812, he was named secretary of the New Appeals Court (Tribunal de Apelaciones), the body that replaced the colonial Appeals Court (Real Audiencia), and later became Minister of the Supreme Court of Justice. Royal Governor Francisco Marc√≥ del Pont appointed him as his secretary in 1815, but after the Battle of Chacabuco put an end to the Royal power in Chile, he went into exile to Lima, Peru where he privately practiced law and became a secretary to the Viceroy. While there he became a widower. Political participation After the death of his wife, he started his theology studies in Cuzco but returned to Santiago in 1821, being finally ordained as a priest on April 21, 1822. He was named rector of Santa Rosa de Los Andes. He was elected a deputy for Los Andes in 1823 and reelected in 1826 and 1829. In 1827, he was named rector of the Instituto Nacional and professor of the Universidad de San Felipe. During this period, he became the principal voice of the clergy, discontented with the new republican order, in replacement of the exiled Bishop Santiago Rodr√≠guez Zorrilla. As such, he participated in the conspiracies that led to the Chilean Civil War of 1829. En 1829 he was named secretary to the victorious Conservative Government Junta. In 1830, President Francisco Ruiz-Tagle named him first Minister of the Interior and Foreign Affairs and later President Jos√© Tom√°s Ovalle named him Minister of Finance. He was reelected to congress again in 1830 and elected as a Senator for Aconcagua in 1831. In 1833 he was secretary of the Constitutional Assembly that redacted and promulgated the new constitution. Meneses was again reelected as a Senator in 1834 and successively until 1849. He was also a journalist who wrote in the El Araucano and the La Gaceta del Rey and was in charge of the National Museum. In March 1830 he became the last rector of the Universidad de San Felipe and after this institution was replaced by the Universidad de Chile in 1843, he became first vice-rector and after 1846 he also was Dean of the School of Law and Political Sciences, position he retained until 1855. In 1856 he was one of the members of the clergy who sued the Archbishop of Santiago Rafael Valent√≠n Valdivieso over the expulsion of verger Pedro Santelices.

It is one of 21 tributaries of Laguna de Bay, contributing about 15% of the total water in the lake. It is thus regularly monitored by the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) through one of its 15 river monitoring stations.  Conservation  In the latest (December 2005 ) Water Quality Status Report listed on the Laguna Lake Development Authority's site, the Santa Cruz River was listed as Class D, with high total coliform concentration. According to the Water Usage & Classification for Fresh Water system used by the Philippines' Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Class D Quality freshwater is suitable for agriculture, irrigation, livestock watering and industrial water supply class II. It also indicated that this status had been \\"maintained\\" since the river was last monitored.  Agricultural Use  Its waters are a source of irrigation water for of ricefields in Pila, Santa Cruz, Liliw, Victoria and Nagcarlan towns. The provincial capital of Laguna Province was put up on the banks of this river. In September 28, 2006, Typhoon Xangsane (PAGASA name Typhoon Milenyo) caused the destruction of the Calumpang Diversion Dam in the Municipality of Liliw, which channeled water to irrigation canals around the area. The dam was built in the 1970s. The livelihood of more than 2,300 farmers in five Laguna towns was put at risk. The storm was only the immediate cause of the damage, with continuous quarrying along the Santa Cruz River cited as the primary cause. The National Irrigation Administration (NIA) said that while the quarry operations were located beyond the dam's radius, the continuous collection of rocks in the lower portion of the area caused erosion in the riverbed. The NIA noted that a survey they conducted before the typhoon showed that the riverbed had dropped by because of erosion. They also estimated that the construction of a new dam would take 11 months to two years to build a new dam depending on the availability of funds. This meant that our farmers might not be able to plant rice for two years prior to the rehabilitation of the dam.

His exact birth year is not known, but it is estimated that he was at least 108 years old when he died. His younger brother was TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene. With his father and brother he was one of the first MƒÅori people to have contact with Europeans when James Cook's ship visited in 1769.The First Pakehas to Visit The Bay of Islands, Te Ao Hou, No 51, June 1965  Name  He was called Patuone when born but acquired the more full name when he was baptised by Archdeacon Henry Williams at Paihia on Sunday, 26 January 1840, just prior to the initial signing of the Treaty of Waitangi on 6 February. Eruera Maihi (Edward Marsh) was the name of Williams' spiritual mentor in England, and this name was also given to Williams' oldest son. Patuone's third wife was Takarangi, sister of the chief Te Kupenga a chief of NgƒÅti Paoa. Takarangi was baptised at the same time, adopting the name Riria (Lydia). Prior to this, in the MƒÅori fashion, the name was simply Patuone, commemorating the deaths of two older brothers, Te Anga and Te Ruanui, killed fighting alongside their father Tapua during wars against the Whangaroa tribe NgƒÅti Pou, who had earlier been forced out of the Hokianga area by expanding hapu (sub-tribal) groupings of what later came to be called NgƒÅpuhi.  Family  Both of Patuone's older brothers Te Anga and Te Ruanui had been killed in fighting on a beach (one), suffering blows from clubs (patu) in fierce hand-to-hand fighting. Thus Patuone's name commemorates an important family event, this being a typical MƒÅori naming convention. Patuone was born the third son and fourth child, there being, in addition to Te Anga and Te Ruanui, an older sister Tari, later to marry the Bay of Islands chief Te Wharerahi, older brother of Rewa and Moka 'Kainga-mataa' and their sister Te Karehu. Patuone's younger brother Nene (later to be TƒÅmati WƒÅka (Thomas Walker) Nene after his baptism which took place prior to Patuone's) was also a highly distinguished chief and collaborated with his tuakana (older brother) on many military and commercial campaigns. Both were fierce promoters of European ways. In their eyes, once MƒÅori had begun to accept European goods in trade and adopt European ways as land sales took place, there was no turning back. PƒÅkehƒÅ (Europeans) were there to stay. The Tapua/Te Kawehau family was directly descended through multiple senior chiefly lines from the eponymous ancestor of NgƒÅpuhi, Rahiri, and his first-born son Uenuku (whose mother was Ahuaiti) and second-born son, Kaharau (whose mother was Whakaruru). In addition to being the ariki of NgƒÅti Hao, Tapua was also the tohunga (high priest). These were the roles and status (mana) Patuone was to inherit from Tapua. Patuone's grandmother Ripia was also a tohunga in her own right. Patuone was to invoke her name in a famous pepeha (retort) to his kinsman Hone Heke at Ohaeawai: \\"Ko te whaiti a Ripia!\\" (\\"We are the small band of Ripia!\\") meaning that we are small in number but valiant in battle. This was in response to Heke's observation that Patuone and Nene, having arrived as a taua to confront their kin who had taken an anti-British stand, with a force of some one hundred, would do better to return home, whereas the forces Heke and Kawiti numbered some eight hundred. Thus Patuone was both inheritor of famous warrior blood and of priestly authority, two attributes which explain in part his capacities and longevity through endless tribal wars and changes such as the arrival of the PƒÅkehƒÅ. As one of the senior chiefs of the NgƒÅpuhi confederation, Patuone was involved, together with his younger brother Nene, in many military campaigns throughout the North Island. Through descent from Rahiri also, Patuone was closely related to all the major chiefs of NgƒÅpuhi, including Hongi Hika, Moetara, H≈çne Heke, Te Ruki Kawiti, Waikato, P≈çmare, Tƒ´tore, Muriwai, Pangari, Taonui, Te Whareumu and Taiwhanga. Patuone was thus born into the fighting aristocracy of the NgƒÅpuhi and from an early age was trained in both the arts of war and in the priesthood. He was famed for his skills and knowledge in both areas, becoming a trusted confidant of many in both the MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ worlds. In fulfilment of the predictions of seers who foretold the coming of the PƒÅkehƒÅ, Patuone witnessed their arrival. His father Tapua was received on board the Endeavour by Captain James Cook on his visit to the Bay of Islands in 1770. Potential enemies knew of the warrior reputation of the Tapua family.  Pakeha relationships  Both Patuone and Nene were highly influential in affairs of the developing nation of New Zealand and Patuone in particular, despite his military prowess, together with his brother-in-law Te Wharerahi, became known as Peacemaker. PƒÅkehƒÅ also referred to him as the Father of the Pakeha since his protection afforded them the capacity to establish a foothold in what was a wild and challenging land, full of dangers to person and property. At the negotiations at Waitangi on 5 February 1840, NgƒÅpuhi chief Te Wharerahi spoke for peace and the acceptance of the European, and was duly supported by Patuone and his brother Nene. Patuone's influence was particularly strong at this gathering of northern chiefs for the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi; persuading a number of chiefs to sign this document on 6 February 1840. Thus, while Patuone would never shy from battle as a last resort, his efforts to avoid conflicts and to settle disputes through negotiation would always precede military conflicts. During the Flagstaff War (1845‚Äì46) he supported his brother TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene in opposing H≈çne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti. Patuone participated in the Battle of Ruapekapeka together with TƒÅmati WƒÅka Nene, Nopera Pana-kareao, Eruera Maihi Tawhai, Repa and about 450 warriors. =Commercial interests= On the commercial front, Patuone as a major chief of the Hokianga, controlled many resources, including extensive kauri (Agathis australis) forests. As well as being prized by the Royal Navy for spars, Kauri became a valuable export to New South Wales and as part of a commercial deal, Patuone became a partner in the Sir George Murray, the first European-style ship to be built in New Zealand in the shipyards at Horeke. Taonui was another partner. On its maiden voyage with Patuone on board, the ship became embroiled in a legal problem and subject to seizure in Sydney where maritime laws of the day required all foreign ships to have a register and to sail under a flag. Since New Zealand as a national entity and nation did not exist, the affair threatened to provoke a major \\"diplomatic\\" problem, given the presence of Patuone and Taonui on board, two of the most high ranking northern chiefs. Already, trade between New South Wales and New Zealand had become significant and, the thought of provoking a severe MƒÅori backlash was not at all attractive to the New South Wales colonial authorities. Eventually, a compromise was reached and this included the design and adoption of an official flag, that of the United Tribes of New Zealand. In 1835, this was extended to include a Declaration of Independence of the United Tribes of New Zealand, signed by mostly northern chiefs as part of an attempt to assert authority within their own land in the face of increasing numbers of traders, whalers, sealers, settlers and missionaries. While King William IV approved the flag, the Declaration was another matter, creating a major problem within the British government and the colony of New South Wales. Apart from the convoluted structures, beliefs and processes of the Colonial Office in London, the Governor of New South Wales was not impressed. There was concern expressed that the Declaration had been \\"created\\" by a group of influential pakeha with ulterior motives and in fact, it was never ratified. It was a serious misjudgment of the MƒÅori capacity to manage their own affairs and set up valid, functioning political structures. =Governors= Patuone knew all of the Governors of New Zealand up to his death and was consulted by them. He developed a particular friendship with Sir George Grey who was to serve two terms as Governor. While Grey's judgment and increasing eccentricity created many problems and MƒÅori became increasingly disaffected and alienated in the face of pakeha law, the friendship remained. Patuone was also an important informant for Grey on the many works he produced on things MƒÅori. Friendship also survived Grey's decision to invade the Waikato, totally against the advice of both Patuone and Tauwhitu, another influential chief whose base was the Matakana, near Kawau Island where Grey maintained a residence, Mansion House, having set the island up as a botanic and animal showcase. Tribal wars Famously, in hand-to-hand combat in 1806 at the battle of Waituna, Patuone killed the Te Roroa/Ngati Whatua chief Tatakahuanui. Thereafter, in no small way, both Patuone and Nene were to contribute to the fame of NgƒÅpuhi as a fighting force, even in the face of major defeats such as the battle of Moremonui in 1807 where the NgƒÅpuhi taua (war party) were surprised at breakfast by a combined NgƒÅti Whatua/Te Roroa force. While Patuone and Nene were not present at this fight, it was a major rout and many of the major chiefs of NgƒÅpuhi present were killed, including Heke's uncle Pokaia and Te Houawe, older brother of Hongi Hika. Hongi's sister Waitapu was also killed and her body desecrated, all it is said as part of helping Hongi to escape to carry on in name and deed the family honour now handed to him with the death of his tuakana. Hongi named one of his muskets Te Teke Tanumia to commemorate his sister's terrible death: she was slit open from the genital region and filled with sand. Given the close kinship connections between NgƒÅpuhi, NgƒÅti Whatua and Te Roroa, this battle was typically a product of many take (issues) overtaking kinship linkages. It was also an endemic feature of groupings in the north: war was not confined to those who were not related. Such was the slaughter of NgƒÅpuhi at Moremonui that the event became known as Te-Kai-a-Te-Karoro (The Seagull's Feast). It was, however, the kinship links which led to a line being drawn in the sand by Te Teke under instructions from the chief Taoho, beyond which no further killing was to take place. Thus, some key NgƒÅpuhi made their escape as a result of kinship and through an act of chivalry so typically MƒÅori. It would not be until 1825 and the battle of Te-Ika-a-Ranganui near Kaiwaka, that NgƒÅpuhi extracted a terrible utu (reprisal; payback) for their military disaster at Moremonui. Part of the NgƒÅpuhi problem was their confidence in that they possessed more muskets but also an unfortunate choice of encampment, vulnerable to surprise attack from concealed positions. The period from 1815 to 1840 saw many wars involving NgƒÅpuhi with southern tribal groupings, especially NgƒÅti Whatua, NgƒÅti Paoa, NgƒÅti Maru and Waikato generally. Following a particularly acrimonious period of major battles with NgƒÅti Paoa in particular, as part of a peace deal between NgƒÅpuhi and NgƒÅti Paoa, Patuone married Takarangi, sister of the NgƒÅti Paoa chief Te Kupenga. This was about 1828. Thereafter, Patuone moved his base to the Hauraki area of South Auckland, maintaining pƒÅ (defensive, fortified villages) at Whakatiwai on the Hauraki Gulf south of present-day Auckland and at Putiki on Waiheke Island. Later, following the gift of at Takapuna, Patuone set up his estate there. Nene was left to supervise and safeguard interests in the Hokianga. Later years thumb Patuone's later years in Auckland did not preclude his being called upon to perform specific duties including being part of the welcome to the Prince and Princess of Wales. As well as continuing business in timber, potatoes and flax (Phormium tenax). Patuone also bred horses. Grey had given him a horse called New Zealander which enjoyed some success at the Auckland races. Patuone was also the source of the first horse ever owned by Te Arawa, a piebald horse called Taika. In the MƒÅori value system, horses carried great value, being regarded as superior property. Patuone and Nene were both to outlive all the old chiefs of NgƒÅpuhi, the deaths of whom began in 1828 with Hongi, Te Whareumu and Muriwai. Patuone directed the rituals leading up to and following the death of Hongi, his relative and fellow warrior. It was a time of great upheaval and Hongi's death, some two years after sustaining a bullet wound in battle with NgƒÅti Pou, led to great fears about revenge attacks from the south. Through Hongi, much suffering had been visited upon the southern tribes. But, New Zealand was developing into a new nation, forged as were many in conflict and difference. 1828 was also a year of family deaths for Patuone: his first wife, Te Wheke, his first-born son Toa, another son Mata and a daughter. Most likely, these deaths were due to some introduced infectious agent such as Tuberculosis. Like many indigenous peoples, MƒÅori had no resistance to introduced diseases and suffered greatly as a result of these. Even things like influenza proved deadly, quite apart from more serious infectious agents and venereal diseases brought in by sailors and settlers. Having outlived all their fellow chiefs, both Patuone and Nene were subjected to considerable resentment from Kawiti's son, Maihi Paraone Kawiti who had personal pretensions and supporters seeking to have him made arikinui or paramount chief of NgƒÅpuhi. Aside from issues of lineage, descent, seniority and mana, this plan foundered. NgƒÅpuhi was always a coalition of closely related chiefs, all of whom had \\"standing\\" in their own right and therefore any notion of a paramount chief was fraught with challenges. It was certainly not a debate into which Patuone and Nene entered: they had no reason to do so as their senior status and great personal mana was clear to all. Nene certainly offered to build a flour mill at his own expense for Kawiti and Heke's people as part of a peace offering but equally, sought the re-erection of the flagstaff at Maiki Hill, an undertaking given by the senior Kawiti prior to his death. Maihi P. Kawiti's petulance was thus many-layered and complex. Patuone was also given a suit of armour by King William IV of Great Britain and a range of other clothing. The official record indicates that the gift was released from the Tower of London on 16 July 1836 and was finally delivered to and signed for by Patuone on 4 November 1837 by the Royal Navy ship . The delivery directly to Patuone at his PƒÅ at Whakatiwai on the Hauraki Gulf, where he was living at the time indicates considerable efficiency on the part of the Royal Navy. HMS Buffalo had also brought Governor Hindmarsh to South Australia and remained there while a suitable house was built for the Governor in order that the Governor could live on board in comfort in the interim. The precise reasons for the gift are unclear but may be related either to Patuone's provision of Kauri spars to the Royal Navy or be a gift as part of consolidation of a commercial relationship. The fate of the suit of armour (which was from the time of King Charles II) is unknown, however, the damp New Zealand climate and likely storage in less than ideal conditions, may well have affected it. Further, since it would have been regarded as a significant taonga (treasure), it is unlikely that it would have been broken up and forged into weapons. No detail is recorded in family archives. On February 26, 1840, the Rev. Henry Williams baptised Patuone, and also, Patuone's wife, by the name of Lydia. Patuone's four wives (Te Wheke, Te Hoia, Takarangi and Rutu) bore a total of twelve children. Hohaia (c.1825-1901), outlived Patuone the longest. Hori Hare Patuone (c.1835-1878) also outlived Patuone and another unnamed Patuone child died in 1886. Patuone's whƒÅngai (adopted) son Timoti (son of a relative, Matetakahia, killed in unfortunate circumstances by Nene), died in 1896. Nene was frequently too hasty in meting out 'justice' and his killing of Matetakahia, whom he thought guilty of the killing of an English trader named Wharangi, was but one example of this haste. The person responsible for the killing of Wharangi was Te Ngarara, who was in turn shot dead as utu (retribution) for the wrongful death of Matetakahia at the hands of Nene. Nene's high status prevented direct utu against him. While some have questioned Patuone's birth details and recollections about Captain Cook's visit to the Bay of Islands in 1770, it is important to recognise the supreme intellectual capacities of great rangatira like Patuone who were trained within the whare wananga over many years to learn and retain copious details across a wide range of everyday and esoteric/priestly knowledge. Tohunga were really the means by which critical knowledge was preserved and handed on; they were the encyclopaedia for MƒÅori. Error was not permitted and would have resulted in instant expulsion from the whare wananga. The mental capacities of senior chiefs and tohunga like Patuone would astound early pakeha explorers and lead to much comment. Therefore, errors in facts and information were highly unlikely, especially from authoritative sources such as Patuone. Patuone's legacy and important political issues Patuone in his later years The life of Patuone spanned the earliest years of pakeha settlement of Aotearoa/New Zealand. Patuone like other chiefly tohunga knew of the old prophecies of Te Maoi and others which foretold the arrival of pakeha. They knew also that their future would be very different from all they had known prior. One reason why Patuone, Nene and others supported the British cause was that they knew there could be no turning back. Pakeha could not be sent home as a failed experiment and in the meantime, they had brought goods, animals, crops and technology which would greatly benefit MƒÅori. The negative aspects of settlement (especially new diseases, new weapons, unhealthy lifestyle changes, tobacco, alcohol) certainly alarmed many MƒÅori leaders, including Patuone, however, he felt that the good came with the bad as a package. While the MƒÅori population outnumbered that of settlers and transients, the missionaries of various Christian persuasions had to invest considerable efforts into the processes of \\"civilising\\", converting and persuading MƒÅori to turn away from practices which were seen as evil, especially things like cannibalism, polygamy and war. MƒÅori remained, however, \\"in control\\". Patuone in literature Patuone is mentioned in a large number of publications and manuscripts but not always accurately and with any authority. The most comprehensive work dedicated to him is the C.O.Davis book, \\"The Life and Times of Patuone, the Celebrated Ngapuhi Chief\\" (1876). Davis was a close friend of Patuone in his later years and was therefore in a position to clarify much about Patuone's life to the extent that Patuone was himself prepared to allow. As a famed chief of the 'old school', imbued with great mana Patuone had nothing to prove and was not interested in any adulation. He allowed his exploits to speak for themselves in the way of the great chiefs of old. References Bibliography *Ballara, A. (2003). Taua. Auckland: Penguin Books. *Belich, J. (1986).

Since 2004, he has held the Canada Research Chair in Global Politics and International Law at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, British Columbia.Douglas & McIntyre From 2017 to 2019, he was concurrently appointed to the Brenda and David McLean Chair in Canadian Studies at UBC. Byers has also taught as a visiting professor at the universities of Tel Aviv, Cape Town, Nord (Norway) and Novosibirsk (Russia).  Political engagement  In February 2004, as Director of Duke University‚Äôs Center for Canadian Studies, Byers hosted Jack Layton in Durham, North Carolina. Later, after Byers‚Äô return to Canada, he began to advise Layton on Canadian defence and foreign policy, most notably with regards to Canada‚Äôs role in the war in Afghanistan. On July 2, 2008, Byers announced that he was seeking the New Democratic Party nomination for the federal riding of Vancouver Centre, a seat held by Liberal Party of Canada incumbent Hedy Fry since 1993, in the 40th Canadian federal election.Ubyssey, July 2, 2008 Byers had not previously sought elected office and the Liberal Party had tried to attract him as a candidate, with Stephane Dion inviting him for a beer in the spring of 2008. Byers received much attention because he was considered by many to be a \\"star\\" candidate for the NDP. During the campaign, Byers was sharply critical of the Harper government's supposed militarization of the Arctic; he also advocated a negotiation with the Taliban in Afghanistan. At a candidates' debate at the end of September 2008, Byers made the controversial statement that the Alberta tar sands needed to be shut down \\"to address the global climate crisis\\". The Liberal and Green candidates claimed that this position contradicted the official NDP platform, while Byers believed that it was covered by already- passed legislation calling on Canada to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions by 80 per cent by 2050.Lai, Tim. Shut down the oilsands, NDP candidate urges . Canwest News Service. September 25, 2008. Accessed on: September 29, 2008. After the national NDP campaign faltered, Fry won reelection with 19,423 votes (34.4% of the popular vote). Byers ran third, with 12,043 votes (21.3%). In 2010, Byers advised Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon on Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy Statement. In May 2017, Cannon announced that he would be starting a PhD under Byers' supervision at UBC. After Jack Layton's death in August 2011, Byers supported Thomas Mulcair's successful campaign for the leadership of the federal NDP.  Writing and advocacy  His books include Custom, Power and the Power of Rules (Cambridge University Press 1999), The Role of Law in International Politics (Oxford University Press 2000), US Hegemony and the Foundations of International Law (Cambridge University Press 2003), War Law (Atlantic Books and, in Canada, Douglas & McIntyre, 2005), and Intent for a Nation: What is Canada For? (Douglas & McIntyre 2007) (playing against George Grant's Lament for a Nation). In 2009, he wrote Who Owns the Arctic? (Douglas & McIntyre 2009), which was shorted for the Donner Prize for the best Canadian book on public policy. Four years later, his International Law and the Arctic (Cambridge University Press 2013) won the Donner Prize. Byers is a regular commentator on CBC on programs such as The Current and The National, and a frequent contributor to The Globe and Mail, National Post, and Toronto Star. His articles have also been published in international newspapers, including the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Times of London, Independent on Sunday, The Guardian, and London Review of Books. Some of his positions: = Liberal‚ÄìNDP coalition = In November 2009, Byers suggested that the Liberal Party of Canada and the New Democratic Party (NDP) \\"should agree to not run candidates against each other in the next campaign\\" in electoral ridings in order to prevent the Conservative Party of Canada from forming another minority government.Liberals and New Democrats together could unseat Harper by Michael Byers, Toronto Star, November 2, 2009. However, critics pointed out that his reasoning is based on the assumption that Liberal voters who are denied the ability to vote for a liberal candidate would automatically vote for a NDP candidate, and that many might instead vote for the Conservatives (or simply not vote at all).Gerry Nicholls: New Democrats for less democracy by Gerry Nicholls, National Post, November 2, 2009. The same proposal was advanced by Nathan Cullen MP in his 2011-12 campaign for the federal NDP leadership. = Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II purchase = Byers was a vocal opponent of the Harper government's proposed purchase of Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighter jets. In July 2010, he wrote: In June 2014, he returned to the subject, comparing the 1960-era Lockheed CF-104 Starfighter and the F-35 Lightning. Both single engine planes are strike aircraft as opposed to air-superiority fighters and are poorly suited for dog- fighting. The single engine makes both vulnerable to failure: 110 of the 239 CF-104 Starfighters crashed before they were replaced by the CF-18s; one quarter of those crashes were attributed to bird strikes. Furthermore, the F-35 Lightning will be equipped with 24 million lines of computer code, making it vulnerable to EMP warfare.Globe and Mail: \\"Will the F-35 be another ‚ÄòWidow Maker‚Äô for Canadian pilots?\\" 12 Jun 2014 = Arctic sovereignty = Byers has written extensively on issues of Arctic sovereignty. In 2007 Byers was critical of the Harper government's change of plans for building new ice- strengthened patrol ships. The previous year the Harper government had announced plans to build three heavy duty icebreakers but in 2007 the Harper government revised the plan to build 6-8 dual use vessels, which would only be capable of operations in one metre of first year sea ice. Byers agreed with a 2010 report prepared for the Senate of Canada that Canadian Coast Guard vessels patrolling the Arctic should be armed, stating, the \\"quiet authority of a deck-mounted gun\\" is not a provocation. On December 28, 2011, the Toronto Star published an article by Byers entitled \\"Russia pulling ahead in the Arctic\\". In that article he pointed out that Canada and Russia have taken identical positions as to whether they exercise sovereignty over the Northwest Passage and Northern Sea Route. Byers also quoted a previously secret US diplomatic cable, released by WikiLeaks, that reported Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's opinion that relations with Russia in the Arctic were good and would not lead to war. Also on December 28, 2011, Al Jazeera published an article by Byers entitled \\"The dragon looks north\\", about China's recent exploration efforts in the Arctic. He suggested China didn't need to challenge the sovereignty of coastal countries in the Arctic because those countries were open to foreign investment and trade and saw the benefits of Chinese capital and Chinese markets. In 2017, Byers published an article in the journal International Relations entitled \\"Crises and International Cooperation: An Arctic Case Study\\". =Pinochet case= Byers was involved in the 1998‚Äì1999 extradition case concerning Augusto Pinochet in the British House of Lords, working with Ian Brownlie QC and members of a legal team representing Amnesty International and other human rights organizations. One of Byers' roles was to speak with the British and international media. He also wrote about the Pinochet Case in the Times of London,\\"The Right Rule for Humanity,\\" Times (London), November 26, 1998, p.24. the London Review of Books,\\"In Pursuit of Pinochet,\\" (21 January 1999) 21(2) London Review of Books 26-27, available at: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v21/n02/michael-byers/in-pursuit-of- pinochet the British Yearbook of International Law,\\"Decisions of British Courts During 1999 Involving Questions of Public International Law,‚Äô (1999) 70 British Yearbook of International Law 277 at 277‚Äì295. and the Duke Journal of Comparative and International Law.\\"The Law and Politics of the Pinochet Case,\\" (2000) 10 Duke Journal of Comparative Law & International Law 415‚Äì41, available at: http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1221&context;=djcil =Afghan detainees= Byers has been involved in the issue of Afghan detainees since January 2002 when he wrote the first widely read op-ed article about Guantanamo Bay, which was published in The Guardian newspaper.\\"US doesn't have the right to decide who is or isn't a PoW,\\" The Guardian, 14 January 2002, available at: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jan/14/afghanistan.comment In September 2005, Byers wrote an article in The Globe and Mail newspaper questioning the legality of Canadian troops transferring Afghan detainees to US custody.\\"Afghanistan: We cannot risk complicity in torture,\\" (27 September 2005) Globe and Mail (Canada) A17.

The $1.6 million project examined the nexus between climate change policy and social justice, with British Columbia serving as a case study for these issues of global consequence. In 2017, Byers co-authored a lengthy article on \\"The Internationalization of Climate Damages Litigation‚Äù in the Washington Journal of Environmental Law and Policy. =Outer space= Byers began working on space issues in 2007 when Canada's largest Space company, MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates (MDA), now a part of Maxar Technologies, wished to sell itself to a US arms manufacturer. MDA is a world leader in synthetic aperture radar satellites such as Radarsat-2, which can produce high resolution images at night and through clouds. Byers appeared before Parliamentary committees and wrote articles in the Globe and Mail and (together with Scott Brison) in the National Post. The Harper government ultimately blocked the sale, based on the importance of the satellites for Arctic security. Byers has written a number of op-ed articles on space issues, including a piece in the Washington Post entitled \\"Elon Musk, President of Mars?\\" and pieces in the Globe and Mail on space debris and asteroid mining. In 2017, Byers and his teenage son Cameron published an article in the journal Polar Record entitled \\"Toxic Splash: Russian rocket stages dropped in Arctic waters raise health, environmental and legal concerns\\". Salt Spring Forum Byers serves as Chair of the Board of the Salt Spring Forum, a charitable organization that organizes an annual speakers‚Äô series on Salt Spring Island, BC. Past guests include Noam Chomsky, Louise Arbour, Conrad Black, Andrew Coyne, Amy Goodman, Chantal Hebert, Naomi Klein, Bill McKibben and David Suzuki.

He was born in Southland, New Zealand. He played his rugby as a full back and wing for Southland at Under 18 and B level, as well as Sevens, between 1976 and 1984. Refereeing career O'Brien began refereeing with the Southland Referees Association in 1984 and combined that with 17 years in the New Zealand Police before turning professional in 1996 with his first game in the Super 12. He took charge of his first test match on 23 October 1994 with the Rugby World Cup qualifier between Hong Kong and South Korea in Kuala Lumpur, which Korea won 28‚Äì17. He also officiated matches of the British and Irish Lions, including the deciding third test on their 2001 tour to Australia. He became New Zealand's most capped test official on 29 March 2003 when he officiated the Six Nations encounter between France and Wales in Paris for his 27th test, taking him past Dave Bishop's record. In the 2005 Queen's Birthday Honours, O'Brien was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby as a referee. IRB administration In 2007, O'Brien, in his capacity as Rugby World Cup Chief of Officials, defended criticism of the refereeing of Wayne Barnes in the France versus New Zealand quarterfinal. Commenting on death threats made against Barnes he said \\"I think it's a disgrace and people have to grow up.\\" He also accused the coach of the United States team, Peter Thorburn, of lying when Thorburn stated that there had been a pre-tournament directive that touch judges should not interfere in issues like forward passes. O'Brien later apologized to Thorburn. In November 2009, O'Brien publicly apologized to New Zealand with regards to the refereeing performance of Stuart Dickinson during an international match against Italy. He subsequently issued a public apology to both Dickinson and the Australian Rugby Union for his breach of IRB protocol in making his comments public rather than going through official channels for commenting on referee performance. During the 2011 Rugby World Cup O'Brien publicly defended referee Alain Rolland's decision to issue Captain Sam Warburton a straight red card during their semi final match against France stating \\"Alain Rolland's decision to issue a red card was absolutely correct in law and in keeping with the clear instructions that match officials have received in recent years regarding dangerous tackling.\\" In May 2012 he was released as head of the Referee Board and substituted by a commission of four members References Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand rugby union players Category:New Zealand rugby union referees Category:New Zealand police officers Category:New Zealand people of Irish descent Category:Officers of the New Zealand Order of Merit Category:World Rugby Awards winners Category:Rugby World Cup referees Category:Super Rugby referees Category:Six Nations Championship referees Category:Rugby Championship referees Category:Invercargill Licensing Trust Board members ","title":"Paddy O'Brien (rugby union)"},{"id":"13642833","text":"Koz≈Ç√≥w may refer to; Places *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Boles≈Çawiec County in Lower Silesian Voivodeship (south-west Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Wroc≈Çaw County in Lower Silesian Voivodeship (south-west Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, DƒÖbrowa County in Lesser Poland Voivodeship (south Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Miech√≥w County in Lesser Poland Voivodeship (south Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Subcarpathian Voivodeship (south-east Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, ≈öwiƒôtokrzyskie Voivodeship (south-central Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Gmina Radzan√≥w in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Gmina Wy≈õmierzyce in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Garwolin County in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Radom County in Masovian Voivodeship (east-central Poland) *Koz≈Ç√≥w, Silesian Voivodeship (south Poland) *Kozliv (formerly Koz≈Ç√≥w), a town in Ternopil Oblast (western Ukraine) People *Richard Kozlow (1926-2008), American artist ","title":"Koz≈Ç√≥w"},{"id":"13642839","text":"Kraszowice () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Boles≈Çawiec, within Boles≈Çawiec County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south- western Poland.

The mill was built in 1929 to recover gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper from ore mined at the Mayflower mine and brought to the mill by an aerial tramway. Regularly active until 1945, it houses still-functional equipment for the separation by flotation of metals from crushed ores. It is the only intact and functional mill of its kind in Colorado. It was included in the expanded Silverton Historic District in 1997, and was declared a National Historic Landmark on its own in 2000.Dawn Bunyak (August 25, 1999) , National Park Service and The mill is owned by the San Juan County Historic Society, which staffs an information and gift shop at the mill under the name Mayflower Mill. The mill is open for self-guided tours in the summer months. Description and history The Mayflower Mill stands east of the town center of Silverton, on the north side of County Road 2 in Arrastra Gulch overlooking the Animas River. The principal mill building is a multistory wood frame structure covered with corrugated metal roofing, its setting in the hillside designed to facilitate the feed of materials by gravitation. Many of its original window openings have been covered by metal. Attahed to it are a series of smaller structures, all of which together house the ore processing infrastructure. The process includes equipment for conveying the ore, crushing it, introducing it into a large tank designed to facilitate the separation of metals by weight from the ore slurry. The mill recovered metals from the ore by gravity separation and by selective flotation.Colorado History The sulfide ore minerals were concentrated by froth flotation, an innovative method in the early twentieth century that allowed processing of ores that would previously have been too difficult for feasibility. The original mill equipment is still in working order. It is the only intact and functional mill of its kind in Colorado. The mill was built in 1929 for the Shenandoah-Dives Mining Company to process ore from the nearby Mayflower Mine. Ore from the mine was delivered to the mill via an aerial tramway over in length. At its peak, the mill processed 1,000 tons of ore per day. It remained in regular operation until 1945, and was largely shut down thereafter to a decrease in government demand for metals occasioned by the end of World War II. It was operated sporadically until 1992 under a variety of owners, and was then taken over by the San Juan County Historical Society as a museum.

The Griffin Communications outlet broadcasts at 106.9 MHz with an ERP of 100 kW and is licensed to Muskogee, Oklahoma. Its studios are located in Downtown Tulsa and its transmitter is south of Bixby. History 106.9 K-HITS logo used until 2016. KHTT was originally KMMM, and it was also known as \\"K-Triple M\\" (the three Ms in its call letters, which also stood for \\"Muskogee's Music Machine\\") and at times it was called \\"The New K107 FM\\". It targeted only Muskogee and the surrounding areas at the time. Very little format history is known for KMMM; one of the formats known for the station is urban contemporary. The station mixed in a few top 40 songs during the daytime and aired a straight ahead Urban presentation by evenings. By 1982 KMMM went dark. In 1982, the station signed back on the air with an upgrade in its signal now allowing it to target Tulsa. It changed its format to a full length Top 40/CHR format and became known as KAYI but still kept the moniker as \\"K107 FM\\". In the early 90s, KAYI evolved in an Adult CHR direction, but the change did not bring success. In November 1993, the station changed its call letters to KHTT and its slogan to \\"K-HITS.\\" It remained an adult-leaning top 40 station for a few more years. Then in the summer of 1996, \\"K-HITS\\" shifted to a more mainstream top 40 format, which it has since used with an astounding success.

Shortly after the deal closed, Renda moved it's existing Tulsa station, then AC KBEZ into the same facility as K107.

Jerusalem remains the Home of the Sisters of Compassion in partnership with the Tangata Whenua. The order's current leader is Sr. Margaret Anne Mills DOLC.https://compassion.org.nz/about-us/leadership/ History Suzanne Aubert, born in France in 1835 joined a group of missionaries bound for New Zealand in 1860. Her vision was to become a member of the Third Order of Mary and to work with MƒÅori. Before moving to Jerusalem where she founded the Sisters of Compassion in 1892, Suzanne worked with the MƒÅori, and cared for the sick in Auckland and Hawkes Bay. Concerned with the many social problems in Wellington she left Jerusalem arriving in Wellington on 6 January 1899, accompanied by Sisters Magdalen, Agnes and Marcelle. Suzanne was by then already well known throughout the country because of her herbal remedies, and also because of her care of abandoned and disadvantaged children regardless of race or creed. In Wellington the sisters very soon established a Home for people with incurable illness; a soup kitchen and a cr√®che. The Home of Compassion at Island Bay opened in 1907, later becoming the headquarters of the Sisters of Compassion, and the formation house where the Sisters did their religious training. During 1913, frustrated with the church bureaucracy and wanting to obtain a Papal Decree for her Congregation, Suzanne Aubert, aged 78, travelled alone to Rome. In 1917 Pope Benedict XV conferred a pontifical Decree on the Congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion. In 1920 Suzanne returned to Wellington as Mother General of the Order she founded. Mother Aubert died at Island Bay on 1 October 1926, aged 91. Her funeral was reported in the newspapers as the greatest ever to be accorded to a woman in New Zealand.  Current Ministries  At present the Sisters of Compassion are engaged in a range of ministries which aim to relieve human suffering. These include: * Nursing and caring for the aged, disabled and sick at St. Joseph's Home of Compassion in Upper Hutt and St. Peter Chanel Home of Compassion in Fiji; * education of school children and adults; * pastoral care; * prison and hospital chaplaincies; * social work and counselling; * parish ministry; * feeding the needy in their Wellington soup kitchen; * serving as advocates; * providing residential accommodation for the elderly. After Suzanne Aubert For some time Suzanne Aubert had foreseen the tremendous advantage of having the Sisters trained as general nurses. After many discussions with the Department of Health, a training hospital was added to the works at Island Bay in 1923. Following government legislation in 1930, the hospital was registered as a grade ‚ÄòA‚Äô Training School in 1932. The congregation grew, and in 1930 a convent was built adjoining the Island Bay Home, with a wing for the Novitiate. The following year the Aubert Home of Compassion was opened in Wanganui for the aged. In 1933, Archbishop Redwood blessed the foundation stone of St. Joseph's Home at Heretaunga, which housed male residents of all ages suffering from chronic diseases. In the same year a Nursery for children under 2 years of ages was opened in Auckland, and in 1939 a four-bed maternity Home was added to this work. In 1941, St Anne's Home, for orphan girls, and for chronically ill residents was opened at Broken Hill (Australia). A modern nursery adjoining the Island Bay Home was built during the same year. From 1945 - 1949 the Sisters helped with the domestic work at Holy Cross Seminary until the arrival of the Sisters of Cluny. In December 1949 four sisters went to Castledare Boys' Home (Australia) to help the Christian Brothers care for the 6- to 10-year-old boys, and remained there until December 1951. On 28 March 1949, Cardinal Fumasoni Biondi, obtained the Decree of Final Approbation of the Congregation of the Daughters of Our Lady of Compassion and its Constitutions from Rome. St Vianney's Home in Timaru was opened in 1951 and during 1952 three more Homes of Compassion were established. Loreto Home in Wagga Wagga (Australia), St Raphael's in Carterton which included a registered primary school), and Chanel Home of Compassion (Fiji). The work in Fiji expanded when the Sisters taught at the newly opened St. Agnes primary school. Bishop Warren of the Diocese of Wilcannia-Forbes (Australia) in 1965, invited the Sisters of Compassion to live and work among the Aboriginal people in Wilcannia. The Sisters provided a dispensary and education from kindergarten level to year 3. The Sisters were there until the end of 1988. The following decades have seen the Sisters work as Hospital and Prison Chaplains, Pastoral and Social workers in Flaxmere, Tonga, and Christchurch. Because of the renewed interest in Herbal Remedies, the Herbal Remedy (RongoƒÅ) Analysis Project was initiated in 1993 to analyse the remaining medicines. The project also reconnected the Sisters of Compassion with hap≈´ from Hawke's Bay and Peata's home area in the Bay of Islands, where Suzanne had earlier gained knowledge of rongoƒÅ, as well as from NgƒÅti Hau and NgƒÅti Ruaka on the Whanganui River. The project, led by Dr Max Kennedy of Industrial Research Ltd, was unable to decode the recipes. However, it successfully documented Suzanne Aubert's rongoƒÅ expertise and experience, defined and protected the 100-year-old intellectual property and led to a distinguished biotechnology award for Suzanne Aubert and for the MƒÅori healers and herbalists who assisted her. During recent years because of changes in society and the diminishing numbers of Sisters, the sisters have had to make the difficult decision to close several institutions. Today the Sisters continue the vision of Suzanne Aubert by addressing the needs of society in the ways that they are able. At Our Lady's Home of Compassion Island Bay, their services include a small Conference and Retreat Centre. In the Wellington inner city, the Suzanne Aubert Compassion Centre operates a soup kitchen and the Sisters visit people in need. In Upper Hutt affordable quality housing for the elderly is provided. Homes of Compassion for the care of the disabled and elderly are situated at Heretaunga and Suva (Fiji). The Sisters of Compassion work with people in Wellington, Wanganui, Jerusalem, Flaxmere, Wainuiomata, Upper Hutt, Wairoa, Auckland, Fiji, Tonga and Wagga Wagga (Australia). The sisters are involved in education, social work, pastoral ministries and care of the elderly. They are also Co-workers, employees, and Directors on Boards. The Mother Aubert Home of Compassion Trust Board established in 1917 holds the land, buildings and investments of the Congregation in trust for the general purpose of maintaining and carrying on the charitable works of the sisters. The Making of a Saint The process leading towards the canonisation of Suzanne Aubert as a saint is now under way. A Diocesan Inquiry was held in Wellington during 2004. All the information gathered during the enquiry was collated and sent to Rome for further investigation.

History It was founded in 1967, mainly under the impetus of Sir Charles Brett, to counter threats to the survival of Ulster's historic architecture. When the UAHS was founded there was no statutory listing of buildings in Northern Ireland and its campaigns led to the establishment of listed building legislation for Northern Ireland in 1972. Subsequently, historic buildings grants, conservation areas and a public buildings record were all developed under the auspices of the Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland), in no small part due to the UAHS. Campaigns Kelly's Cellars, Belfast, in 2007 In February 2015 it was reported that the Department of the Environment proposed delisting 17 Belfast buildings, including the historic Kelly's Cellars, subject to review by the Historic Buildings Council and Belfast City Council. UAHS declared that \\"despite their present condition, all buildings currently proposed for delisting contribute to the value of Belfast‚Äôs fragile built heritage and are important resources to promote tourism, economic investment and social regeneration\\". In March 2015 Belfast city councillors vowed to fight the Department of Environment over plans to remove protective listed status from Kelly's Cellars, now one of eight properties which the department has indicated that it plans to delist. Events UAHS also organises a range of architecturally-related events.

It is situated on the A16 road, south from Grimsby and north from Louth. Utterby railway station (or Utterby Halt), on the line between Grimsby and Louth, closed in 1961. Near to the Village is the site of a former Gilbertine priory.Catholic Herald 26 March 2004 \\"Medieval English order enjoys revival in Brazil\\" It is believed that the monks of this priory built the village's Packhorse bridge in the 14th century. The Prime Meridian passes to the east of Utterby. Toponymy The name Utterby comes from the Scandinavian 'by' which means village, and is a common place name suffix in the area. The 'utter' comes from the Old English 'uttera', cognate with the modern English word 'outer', or remote, and not the modern Swedish 'utter' which means otter. Therefore, to the Vikings this was 'the remote village'. This is a common construction also seen in Itterby, one of the parishes which formed Cleethorpes, and also Ytterby in Sweden, which is relatively frequent in Scandinavia and from which derive the names of the Chemical elements Yttrium, Ytterbium, Terbium and Erbium.

It first aired on The WB television network in the United States on September 23, 2003. It was written by Mark Schwahn and directed by Bryan Gordon. It introduces the character of Lucas Scott (played by Chad Michael Murray) -- a high school student -- and his friends and relatives in the fictional Tree Hill, North Carolina. Plot An important basketball game is going on at Tree Hill High School. The Ravens' team wins, thanks to Nathan Scott's (James Lafferty) final shot. Elsewhere, Nathan's half-brother Lucas Scott is playing basketball with three friends. Nathan and Lucas share the same father, Dan Scott (Paul Johansson), but they live apart: it is suggested that Dan abandoned Lucas and his mother, Karen Roe (Moira Kelly) when Lucas was born, preferring to marry Deb Scott (Barbara Alyn Woods), with whom he had Nathan. Nathan and his team are busted for stealing a school bus. Even though Nathan was driving, his father, Dan, manages to bail him out of trouble, as usual, while other players are suspended. During a drive, Nathan's girlfriend (and Ravens‚Äô cheerleader) Peyton Sawyer (Hilarie Burton), nearly runs over Lucas after becoming distracted at the wheel. Lucas heads for Karen's caf√©, where he has dinner with his mother and his best friend, Haley James (Bethany Joy Lenz). The next day, Keith Scott (Craig Sheffer), Dan's elder brother who is close friends with Karen, asks Whitey Durham (Barry Corbin), the Ravens coach, to let Lucas be part of the team. Keith is positive that the kid deserves it. The coach tells Lucas he can join the Ravens. Nathan then challenges Lucas to a basketball match, with the stipulation that the loser will walk away from the team. Later, Peyton's car breaks down and Lucas comes to her assistance. During a discussion, Lucas relays his history with Dan and Nathan. Lucas shows up at Keith's shop by the time Dan is talking to Keith about Karen. Following this, Lucas makes up his mind and accepts Nathan's challenge. After winning the game, Lucas lets Peyton know that Nathan has to stay on the team because \\"it's the last thing he wants\\". In the last scene, Lucas enters the school's gym while everyone is staring at him. A last close-up to the park where Lucas used to play: it's finally empty. Production One Tree Hill was first created to be a feature-length movie with the title Ravens. However, Mark Schwahn was convinced by fellow producer Joe Davola that it would be more interesting as a TV series. The series features an unaired pilot episode which takes place in the past. It tells the story of Karen and Dan and how she got pregnant. Then, after Dan marries Deb it skips to the future where Lucas has his first day at Tree Hill High. He meets Mouth and others and realizes that maybe basketball is for him; that is, until he and Nathan get into a fight about Dan. In the broadcast pilot episode, Brooke Davis (portrayed by Sophia Bush) does not appear and makes her first appearance in The Places You Have Come to Fear the Most as she was cast after the show was greenlit for a full season. Samantha Shelton also played a character called Reagan in the unaired pilot. She was replaced with the character Haley. Reception In the U.S., the episode's initial broadcast attracted two and a half million viewers on The WB Television Network. The episode received generally mixed reviews. Critics compared it to The O.C. and Dawson's Creek, but with a more masculine appeal.

This strategy is useful when interest rates are rising; as the short term maturities are rolled over they receive a higher interest rate, raising the value. A contrasting strategy is the bullet strategy, which involves investing only in intermediate-term bonds. Concept A barbell strategy is one of several different types of portfolio strategies that is designed to create a reasonable return on the investments that are part of the asset portfolio. The barbell strategy is built around the concept of focusing on the maturities of the securities in the portfolio by making sure the maturity dates are either very close or at a distant date. It is similar to the laddered approach. Application The key to employing a barbell strategy is seeking to include bonds and other securities set to mature either in the short term or the long term. While it is always a good idea to include a mix of investments with a variety of maturation dates, this approach concentrates those dates at opposite ends of the spectrum. This means that two blocks or groups are created within the portfolio, rather than having securities that mature consistently from one period to the next. Benefits  The barbell strategy allows for a quick turnover of a significant amount of the assets in the portfolio at one time. For example, attention should be paid to the block of short-term investments, so they can all be rolled over into new short-term investments as they reach maturity. Typically, this leads to an increase in the value of the investments that are turned over, thus increasing the overall value of the investment portfolio. Theoretical results Under simplistic assumptions about forward rates, a bar-bell portfolio comprising only the shortest dated bond and the longest on offer has been shown to maximize modified excess return. Variations One variation of the barbell strategy involves investing 90% of one's assets in extremely safe instruments, such as treasury bills, with the remaining 10% being used to make diversified, speculative bets that have massive payoff potential. In other words, the strategy caps the maximum loss at 10%, while still providing exposure to huge upside. This strategy works best during periods of high inflation for three reasons: High interest rates make put options cheaper in accordance to the Black Scholes option pricing formula, stock crashes have historically occurred during periods of high interest rates (1987, 1998, 2000, 2007, etc.), and a high interest rate helps finance the trader's bankroll for when the market doesn't crash, which is most of the time. With interest rates still at zero, this strategy is much less effective. Thirty-year bonds pay more, but are volatile. Foreign and corporate bonds are also quite volatile and far from risk-free.

The bullet strategy is based on the acquisition of a number of different types of securities over an extended period of time, but with all the securities maturing around the same target date. One of the main benefits of the bullet strategy is that it allows the investor to minimize the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate, while still realizing excellent returns on the investments.  Advantages  Bullet strategies are relatively simple to implement and construct. The first step is to determine at what point on the yield curve the series of investments should mature. This will help lead to the incremental acquisition of additions to the portfolio that will reach maturity on the same target date. Staggering the acquisition dates of the assets means that the risk associated with interest rates is diluted. The investor is able to pick up good deals on various bonds and other securities along the way, arranging the maturities to coincide with the desired final date. One of the advantages of the bullet strategy is that the investments are acquired and then set aside until the maturity date arrives. Of course, this means that the funds used to acquire the securities should not be used until the date of maturity. However, for people who are thinking in terms of creating a windfall in revenue at a given point in time, this approach is an excellent solution. The earnings realized from the bullet strategy may be used to make final payments on property, handle a balloon payment that is due, or fund a college education. The bullet strategy can be composed of any number of different types of bonds and other securities. With no limit on the number of assets that can be employed as part of this investment scheme, it is possible for the investor to gradually accumulate all the assets needed to ensure the level of return that is desired at a certain point in time. Both small investors as well as investors who deal in major stocks and bonds can employ the bullet strategy, and create an attractive return for the investment.  Alternatives  By comparison, in a barbell strategy the maturity of the bonds included in the portfolio is concentrated at two extreme maturities, while in the strategy referred to as laddering or ladder strategy the portfolio is constructed to have approximately equal amounts of each maturity.

Set on the north bank of the Conejos River, it is where explorer Zebulon Pike raised the American flag on Spanish soil in 1807. The site, now managed by Historic Colorado, includes a reconstruction of a wooden stockade, built according to Pike's detailed description of the original. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1961.Joseph Scott Mendinghall (December 1, 1975) , National Park Service and . Description and history Pike's Stockade is located about northeast of Sanford, at the end of County Road 24 on the northern bank of the Conejos River. Now a small park, the site is now less forested than it was at the time of Pike's expedition. The stockade is a wooden structure, roughly , with bastions at the two northern corners. The stockade is built out of oak, a longer-lasting material than the cottonwood Pike used in 1807. Like Pike's construction, the stockade has no normal doorways, and is entered through a tunnel that passes under one of the walls. In deference to public access, the tunnel is lined in concrete, and the stockade itself is built on a concrete foundation. Zebulon Pike led one of several exploratory expeditions commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase to understand what exactly had been acquired. His expedition left St. Louis in July 1806, and reached this point in January 1807. The fort was built primarily as a defense against attack from the Spanish, on whose territory Pike had (either knowingly or innocently) encroached. On February 26, a force of 100 Spanish cavalry arrived at the fort, and requested that he come to Santa Fe, the territorial capital, to discuss the matter. Pike and his men went with the Spanish force, and were eventually released in July 1807.

Season one =Lucy Webster skits= Seasons 1 and 2 *Lucy Webster (Rebel Wilson) - Lucy is an overweight, outcast schoolgirl who stalks a boy she likes (named 'Dylan'), and often talks about how she thinks he likes her, but it is implied he is disgusted by her. She also stares in to the screen at him watching her. (Although a possible plot inconsistency is the fact that she appears on the computer screen, which would in all probability be his, as she would not need to bring her own image up on the screen; and therefore his attempts to shake her off would seem to be in conflict with the fact he still actively engages in internet communication with her.) She briefly stopped stalking Dylan in order to stalk her school counsellor, Andrew, but has since returned to Dylan. She also does horrible things to Dylan's girlfriends saying-\\"Well, now that they're out of the way, we get back to our schedule\\"(A timetable Lucy had made for their dates and when they should make passionate love). On the second series she starts a website with the web address, LandofLucy.com.au where she gives advice to people on how to live life to its best. * Dylan Mortlock - Dylan is the boy that is trying to avoid Lucy at all costs from stalking him. During the middle of the first season, Dylan informed the school counsellor about Lucy's stalking habits and got rid of her since she started stalking Andrew, but Lucy returned to him later in the season. *Damien - Damien is Dylan's friend, who presumably is gay, he was told off by Lucy in the early stages of the first season and was sent to military school by his father. Damien was mentioned later in the season, going to the school dance. *Miss Rogers - Miss Rogers was very briefly, Lucy's counsellor at school but she was in a car accident because her brakes failed and she is in a coma.

He frequently throws away chances of becoming rich by ignoring the \\"heavy metal\\" in his creek (actually gold) and throwing away wine that is \\"like 100 years old.\\". Despite his misfortune, Jack's mantra is \\"Could be worse\\" and is normally interrupted by the \\"f***ing flies\\". * Jill Farmer (Marney McQueen) - Jill is Jack's wife and most worthy companion. She sometimes has to leave the farm and is sometimes a little inconsiderate of Jack, for example, using him as a horse and carriage. * Ennis (Anthony Ahern) - Whenever Jill has to leave the farm, she is replaced by a (presumably homosexual) cowboy called Ennis (Anthony Ahern), a parody of Heath Ledger's character from Brokeback Mountain, leading to many homosexual double entendres, such as \\"Ennis is a big fan of my back paddock\\" and \\"Are we just going to leave our rods out?\\" (referring to fishing rods).
